1n2mtig,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n2mtig,OutIn Fino Portable Electric Coffee Grinder Review,"Hey everyone! How are you?

Since there aren't any reviews of OutIn's electric grinder here on the sub, I decided to talk a little about it.
I apologize in advance for the long post.

If you'd like to watch the video about noise testing, grinding levels, and cleaning: https://youtu.be/2U20uAW4P64?si=ortYvqk8qHE1kZWj

Fino Unboxing: https://youtube.com/shorts/hGDY3RBBHTI?si=FXGtihCIEwpMmiHc

When you receive the grinder, it's not fully charged. In fact, it doesn't come with enough battery to grind a single coffee. So, after removing the seal/stickers, you'll charge it. The charging port is on the back of the device.

 The manual recommends using the cable that comes with the grinder and a 5V/1A charger. Has the white light stopped flashing? That's it, it's fully charged. It takes about an hour to fully charge.

Clear/white light: 100%~30%.
Yellow light: 20% (I charge when the yellow light appears)
Red light: Charge the grinder.

Warning if you haven't respected the ""breathing time"" (90 seconds between grinds) or have ground for more than 5 minutes: The white light will flash three times and your grinder will stop working. I'm a bit of a wimp and I respected the recommended time. I haven't had any problems with this.

""Bean blockage"" warning (some beans are stuck): The red lights will flash. This happened to me. I tapped the side lightly, and the grinder corrected it, grinding the stuck beans during the next grind.  If that doesn't work: Disassemble (explained below) and clean.

Construction:

It's made of aluminum, silicone, and food-grade plastic. It has a 38mm conical (7-sided) blade, external adjustment, and a rubberized base to keep your grinder steady while working. It weighs 690 grams.

It has a great grip, and although I've only used it twice, I feel confident in saying it's comfortable to carry. With my bad arm, I managed to carry a backpack, a scale, the Nano, and a V60 with it. If I didn't feel uncomfortable, you certainly won't.

It's solid enough to stay on your countertop, yet light enough to carry in your backpack.

Passions aside, it's truly beautiful. You don't need to hide it in a cabinet. It's a device you're proud to have on your countertop (I'm trying to contain myself here, as I think the Fino is the most beautiful device in my setup).

Maximum capacity per grind:

25 grams. Can it handle 25 grams? Yes, but it can make a mess, and yes, this is very personal, but 25 grams per grind is a lot for me. I grind 5, 6, 16, and 18 grams. No mess and in what I consider to be a great time.

Grinding time:

The manual recommends a 90-second rest between grinds and not to grind for more than five minutes continuously.

 Some notes on grinding time:

Grinding 5 grams on click 1: 37 seconds

Grinding 15.5 grams on click 2: 58 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 3: 25 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 4: 25 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 5: 22 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 6: 18 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 7: 17 seconds

Grinding 16.2 grams on click 7: 48 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 8: 17 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 9: 15 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 10: 14 seconds

Grinding:

Uniform, consistent, generates very few fines and retention is minimal (in most cases).  Most of the time, I didn't experience any retention. I have a video showing this, in case anyone is interested. I took the photos at all grind levels. One additional note: I didn't clean (disassemble) the grinder between grinds. I started at 10 and worked my way down to 01, just to capture real-life use.
See the photos and let me know what you think.

Cleaning:

Using the key (it's inside the grinder box, next to the handle), turn it counterclockwise and remove the parts (memorize the order: screw, blade, spring. Use the opposite direction when assembling). Then, use the blower (they send one inside the box) and a dry, clean brush. Clean and reassemble.

Battery life:

Initially, I used it and didn't keep a count. For this analysis, I grinded 19 grinds of different sizes and weights, and the battery indicator remains white (100%~30%).  During the 19 grinds, I ground about 150 grams of coffee.

Noise:

In my opinion, the noise is completely tolerable. Since I couldn't upload a video to Reddit, I tested it with a decibel meter (it's not a professional decibel meter, but it was the best way I could find to ""show"" the noise to you).

Pros and Cons:

Regarding the pros and cons, a direct and completely honest opinion: I could say that ""my ratio, for filter coffees, is 16 grams (1:15.6). If I needed to make two filter coffees at the same time, I wouldn't be able to, since the Fino's maximum capacity per grind is 25 grams,"" but I found it unfair to the grinder. I wouldn't make two filter coffees at the same time in practically any real-life situation. I have observations about the Nano, for example, but the Fino, in my opinion, has no negative points.

 I owned a C3 and a K4 and... Well, I'm very happy with the Fino and don't miss my old grinders at all. I also don't see myself replacing this grinder with another (remember: This is very personal. For me, it's perfect). It's beautiful, portable, has an excellent battery, virtually no retention, a good weight, the grind is uniform and consistent, its construction is incredible, and the only physical effort I need to exert is pressing a button.

That's it, folks. If I missed any details, feel free to ask me in the comments and I'll be happy to answer.

Sorry for the long story, any grammatical errors (English isn't my native language), and thank you for your time.

1n2mtgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/outlier_ai/comments/1n2mtgh/my_account_was_permanently_banned_by_outlier_5/,My account was permanently banned by Outlier 5 minutes after I passed a screening. Their reason is beyond absurd.,"Hey everyone,

I'm honestly just stunned right now and need to vent and hopefully get some advice. I feel like I've just been railroaded by a faulty algorithm at Outlier, and their support is a brick wall.

Here’s the insane timeline of what happened:

A few days ago, I requested the ""Medical Knowledge Screening"" to add to my profile. Support gave me access, and I took it yesterday. The test itself was incredibly basic standard stuff that any medical professional would know off the top of their head. There was only one question that required a video recording. I answered it on the spot, finished the screening, and immediately got a big ""Congratulations, you've passed!"" notification.

I was on a high, thinking ""Great, that's done."" I kid you not, FIVE MINUTES LATER, I was trying to navigate the site and was abruptly logged out. When I tried to log back in, it said my account was disabled.

Confused, I checked my email. There was a message from Outlier saying my account was permanently deactivated for violating their community guidelines. No details, just a generic accusation. When I finally got a response from support, their reason was so ridiculous I had to read it twice: they claimed I was ""consistently reading from an unauthorized source.""

Here's the kicker: I am a Medical Doctor. I have a significant background in medical research and have published papers in top-tier, Q1 journals. The idea that I would need to cheat on a screening covering the fundamentals of my own profession is not just insulting, it's completely illogical.

My answer to the video question was 100% improvised, and frankly, it probably sounded like it. It wasn't a polished, robotic speech because I'm a real person answering a question, not a TV presenter reading a script. I tried to explain the context to them:

My webcam is in a weird spot on the side of my monitor, so I have to physically look away from the screen to look ""at the camera."" On top of that, I was dealing with a nasty case of eye strain that day and wasn't wearing my glasses. Staring at a bright screen was literally painful, so of course I was frequently looking away to give my eyes a break.

It's insane that this combination of factors gets flagged as ""cheating"" by their system. Their response was basically a canned message saying the decision is final.

I went from a valued contributor to permanently banned in less time than it takes to make a cup of coffee, all based on a flawed algorithm that can't understand context. I'm just devastated and incredibly frustrated by the lack of any real human review.

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of arbitrary, automated decision from Outlier or a similar platform? Is there any way to escalate this beyond their generic support to get a real person to look at my case? Any advice would be hugely appreciated.",2,1756411736.0,outlier_ai,1,1.0,False

*Finding joy in the rhythm of everyday moments*

---

## The Dawn Chorus We've Lost Touch With 🐦

Every morning, as the first light creeps across the horizon, something magical happens that most of us sleep through. Millions of feathered creatures burst into song, creating a symphony that has played uninterrupted for millennia. While we rush through our morning routines, checking phones and gulping coffee, nature's performers are already celebrating another day of existence.

This daily concert isn't just background noise – it's a masterclass in living fully. These creatures don't sing because they have to; they sing because they're alive, and that's reason enough for celebration.

## The Lost Art of Daily Celebration 🎉

Somewhere along the way, humans developed a peculiar habit: we started saving celebration for special occasions. Birthdays, promotions, holidays – we packed all our joy into tiny boxes marked ""appropriate times to be happy."" Meanwhile, we treat regular Tuesday afternoons like something to endure rather than experience.

But what if we've got it backwards? What if the ordinary moments are actually extraordinary, and we've just forgotten how to see them?

Think about it: you woke up this morning. Your heart kept beating while you slept. Your lungs kept working. Billions of cells in your body performed their functions without you having to think about it once. That's pretty incredible, isn't it?

## Morning Rituals That Actually Matter ☀️

The creatures that greet each dawn with song understand something we've forgotten: beginnings are sacred. Not in any mystical sense, but in the very practical sense that each new day offers a fresh start, new possibilities, and another chance to experience life fully.

Here are some simple ways to reclaim your mornings:

**Create Your Own Dawn Chorus** 🎵
You don't need to sing (though you certainly can). Instead, find one small thing each morning that brings you genuine pleasure. Maybe it's the first sip of coffee, the feeling of cool air on your face, or simply stretching your arms above your head.

**Practice Micro-Celebrations** 🎊
Notice small wins throughout your day. Your plants grew a little overnight. You remembered to water them. The traffic light turned green just as you approached. Your friend texted you something funny. These aren't coincidences – they're opportunities to feel good about being alive.

**Establish Connection Moments** 🌱
Spend a few minutes each morning observing something in the natural world, even if it's just a houseplant or the way sunlight hits your window. This isn't about becoming one with the universe; it's about remembering you're part of something larger than your immediate worries.

## The Evening Reflection Revolution 🌙

Just as dawn deserves recognition, the end of each day offers its own opportunities for celebration. Evening isn't just about winding down – it's about acknowledging that you made it through another day, learned something new, or simply existed in the world for another 24 hours.

**The Three-Good-Things Practice** ✨
Before bed, identify three things that went well during your day. They don't have to be major accomplishments. Maybe you had a pleasant conversation with a stranger, enjoyed a particularly good meal, or noticed something beautiful you'd never seen before.

**Release the Day's Weight** 💤
Instead of carrying today's stress into tomorrow, practice a simple mental exercise: imagine setting down everything that didn't go perfectly. Not ignoring problems that need solutions, but releasing the emotional weight of things beyond your control.

## Why This Matters More Than Ever 🌍

In our achievement-obsessed world, we've created a strange situation where we're constantly working toward some future moment of happiness while missing the happiness available right now. We've made celebration contingent on external validation instead of internal appreciation.

The winged creatures that sing at dawn and dusk don't wait for permission to celebrate. They don't need achievements or approval. They celebrate existence itself, and in doing so, they add beauty to the world.

## Practical Steps for Everyday Celebration 🚀

**Start Stupid Small** 🐣
Don't attempt to transform your entire outlook overnight. Begin with noticing one pleasant thing each morning and one each evening. That's it. No journaling, no elaborate rituals, no life overhauls.

**Use Your Senses** 👂
Pay attention to what you're actually experiencing right now. The taste of your food, the texture of your clothes, the sounds around you. Most of our anxiety lives in thoughts about the past or future, but joy lives in present-moment awareness.

**Create Celebration Cues** 🔔
Link small celebrations to things you already do regularly. When you wash your hands, appreciate having clean water. When you turn on a light, notice how easily you can banish darkness. When you see another person, remember how remarkable it is that humans can communicate and cooperate.

**Share the Practice** 🤝
Tell someone about something good that happened to you today, no matter how small. Ask them to share something good from their day too. Celebration is contagious, and spreading it makes it stronger.

## The Ripple Effect of Joy 🌊

Here's something interesting about celebrating everyday moments: it changes how other people feel around you. When you're genuinely appreciative of simple pleasures, you become more pleasant to be around. When you notice good things, you help others notice them too.

This isn't about forced positivity or ignoring real problems. It's about balance. Yes, challenges exist and need attention. But so does beauty, and so do countless small wonders that make life worth living.

## Building Your Personal Dawn and Dusk 🌅🌇

You don't need to wake up at sunrise or stay up until sunset. Your ""dawn"" is whenever you begin your day with intention, and your ""dusk"" is whenever you end it with gratitude.

The point isn't to mimic nature's schedule but to adopt nature's wisdom: that life itself is worth celebrating, that beauty exists in ordinary moments, and that joy is always available to those who choose to notice it.

**Making It Sustainable** 🔄
The key to lasting change is consistency over intensity. Better to celebrate one small thing every day for a year than to have one perfect celebration that you can't maintain.

**When You Forget** 🤷
You will forget sometimes. You'll have days when nothing seems worth celebrating. That's normal and human. The practice isn't about perfection; it's about return. When you remember, simply begin again.

## The Science of Simple Joy 🧠

Research consistently shows that people who regularly practice gratitude and celebration experience better physical health, stronger relationships, and increased resilience during difficult times. But you don't need studies to tell you that focusing on good things feels better than focusing on problems.

Our brains are naturally wired to notice threats and problems – this kept our ancestors alive. But in modern life, this tendency often works against our wellbeing. Deliberately noticing positive experiences helps balance this natural negativity bias.

## Creating a Culture of Celebration 🌟

Imagine if more people adopted this simple practice. Instead of bonding over complaints, we could share our daily discoveries of beauty. Instead of waiting for major life events to feel joy, we could find it in ordinary Tuesday afternoons.

This isn't about becoming unrealistic or naive. It's about becoming more complete – acknowledging both the challenges and the wonders of human existence.

## The Long View 🔭

Four centuries from now, the basic human experience will likely remain remarkably similar to today. People will still wake up each morning, still face daily challenges, still experience both joy and sorrow. The technology will change, but the opportunity to celebrate existence will remain constant.

The creatures that sing at dawn will still understand what we sometimes forget: that being alive, aware, and capable of appreciating beauty is extraordinary, not ordinary. Their daily celebration isn't about optimism or pessimism – it's about reality. The reality that consciousness, in any form, is remarkable.

## Your Dawn Chorus Begins Now 🎶

Starting tomorrow morning, or even right now, you can begin your own version of the dawn chorus. Not with song necessarily, but with attention, appreciation, and acknowledgment that another day of existence is beginning.

You can end each day like those evening serenaders, not with regret for what didn't happen, but with appreciation for what did. Not with worry about tomorrow, but with satisfaction that today was experienced, fully and consciously.

The choice to celebrate ordinary moments is always available. The only question is whether you'll remember to make it.

The world is, indeed, meant to be celebrated. Not just the extraordinary parts, but all of it – the morning coffee, the afternoon sunlight, the evening quiet, and the simple miracle of being aware enough to notice any of it at all.

Your celebration starts now. 🌈

Alexander points to a felt “**Quality Without a Name**” (places that feel alive, coherent, easeful). Three fast ideas from him that map to behavior design:

* **Patterns:** recurring solutions that fit a context (e.g., porches, alcoves, commons tables).
* **Centers:** clear focal points that organize everything around them.
* **Unfolding:** grow the thing step-by-step with users, instead of top-down master plans.

**Some quick bridges (place → behavior → how to check):**

* **Small bench by the door → more “hey” moments.** Count quick greetings before/after adding a perch.
* **One obvious center (coffee/tea table) → more helpful chats.** Tally spontaneous huddles/help requests nearby.
* **Quiet nook with a back wall → longer focus breaks.** Track interruptions/time-on-task in nook vs. hallway.
* **Softer light + fabric + plants → calmer tone.** Note conflict incidents or a simple 1–5 “calm” check-in. Where have you tried something like this, and what changed?

*Creating authentic connections through continuous personal development*

---

## 🎨 Love as a Creative Process

Think about the most beautiful sculpture you've ever seen. Behind that masterpiece lies countless hours of careful work - gentle chiseling, thoughtful molding, and patient refinement. Relationships work in remarkably similar ways. When two people commit to growing together, they become both the artist and the clay in each other's hands.

This isn't about changing your partner or forcing them into your ideal vision. Instead, it's about creating a safe space where both people can shed unnecessary layers and reveal their most authentic selves.

## 🎭 Breaking Free from Social Scripts

We all wear masks. From childhood, society hands us scripts about how we should behave, what roles we should play, and who we should become. Men get told to be strong and unemotional. Women receive messages about being nurturing and accommodating. These expectations become invisible prisons that prevent us from showing up as our true selves.

**Daily Action Step:** Notice when you're performing a role rather than being yourself. Are you agreeing with your partner when you actually disagree? Are you hiding your enthusiasm about something because it doesn't fit your ""image""? Start small by sharing one authentic thought or feeling each day.

## 🌱 The Power of Flexibility

Imagine clay that refuses to be shaped - it would crack and crumble. Successful partnerships require what we might call ""emotional flexibility."" This means being open to feedback, willing to examine your habits, and ready to evolve.

This doesn't mean being a pushover or losing your identity. It means recognizing that growth often comes from seeing ourselves through someone else's loving perspective.

**Practical Example:** When your partner points out a habit that bothers them, instead of immediately defending yourself, try asking: ""Can you help me understand why this affects you?"" This simple shift opens the door to understanding rather than conflict.

## 🔧 Daily Tools for Mutual Development

### Morning Check-ins (5 minutes)
Start each day by sharing:
- How you're feeling emotionally
- What you're looking forward to
- Any concerns on your mind
- One way your partner could support you today

### Evening Reflections (10 minutes)
Before bed, discuss:
- What went well in your interaction today
- Any moments of tension and what triggered them
- One thing you appreciated about your partner
- One area where you could improve tomorrow

### Weekly Growth Sessions (30 minutes)
Set aside time each week to:
- Share something new you've learned about yourself
- Discuss patterns you've noticed in your relationship
- Set small goals for personal improvement
- Celebrate progress you've both made

## 🏗️ Building Unshakeable Foundations

Strong relationships aren't built on perfection - they're built on commitment to continuous improvement. When both partners dedicate themselves to personal growth, something magical happens. The relationship becomes larger than either individual, creating a foundation that can weather any storm.

**Key Principles for Daily Practice:**

🎯 **Consistency Over Intensity:** Small daily efforts trump occasional grand gestures. Spending five minutes truly listening to your partner matters more than one expensive dinner where you're both distracted.

🎯 **Curiosity Over Judgment:** When your partner does something that confuses or frustrates you, approach it with genuine curiosity rather than immediate criticism.

🎯 **Progress Over Perfection:** Celebrate small improvements rather than waiting for dramatic transformations.

## 🌟 The Transformation Process

As you and your partner commit to this mutual development process, you'll notice several stages:

**Stage 1: Awareness** - You start noticing patterns and automatic responses you never saw before.

**Stage 2: Awkwardness** - Changing feels uncomfortable at first. This is normal and temporary.

**Stage 3: Integration** - New behaviors start feeling more natural and authentic.

**Stage 4: Flow** - You develop a rhythm of continuous growth together.

## 🎪 Handling Resistance and Setbacks

Not every day will feel like progress. Sometimes you'll slip back into old patterns. Sometimes your partner will resist feedback. Sometimes you'll both feel frustrated with the process.

**When this happens:**
- Remember that setbacks are part of growth, not signs of failure
- Return to basics: kindness, patience, and small consistent actions
- Focus on your own development rather than trying to change your partner
- Seek outside support when needed (friends, mentors, counselors)

## 🚀 Long-term Vision

Imagine your relationship 10, 20, or even 50 years from now. If you both commit to this process of mutual development, you won't just be the same people who happened to stay together. You'll be evolved versions of yourselves - more authentic, more compassionate, more resilient.

The challenges that would have broken you apart in year one become opportunities for deeper connection in year ten. The masks that once kept you separate become distant memories as you live more authentically together.

## 💡 Making It Sustainable

The key to long-term success lies in making these practices feel natural rather than forced:

- **Start small:** Choose one or two practices rather than trying to overhaul everything at once
- **Be patient:** Allow months or even years for significant changes to solidify  
- **Stay playful:** Approach growth with curiosity and humor rather than grim determination
- **Celebrate wins:** Acknowledge progress regularly, no matter how small

## 🎁 The Ultimate Gift

When two people commit to helping each other become their most authentic selves, they give each other the rarest gift possible: the freedom to be real. No more exhausting performances. No more hiding important parts of themselves. No more walking on eggshells.

Instead, they create a sanctuary where both people can continue evolving throughout their lives, always supported by someone who sees their potential and believes in their growth.

This isn't just about having a good relationship - it's about becoming the fullest version of yourself while helping someone you love do the same. It's about creating something beautiful together that will inspire others and leave a lasting positive impact on the world.

The sculptor's chisel reveals what was always there, hidden in the stone. In the same way, loving relationships reveal the authentic person that was always there, waiting to emerge from beneath layers of social conditioning and fear.

Your relationship can become a masterpiece, but only if you're both willing to be the clay and hold the chisel with equal commitment and care.

And got a grinder just 15 days back and I can tell you the difference is insane. Like night and day, black and white. The freedom that a grinder gives you to dial in your beans and experimenting w/ them is such a huge plus. I've experienced my coffee was extra bitter or extra sour at times but after grinding my beans fresh I started noticing much more clarity in the flavour but there was still sourness. But since past 7 days I am timing my shots, aiming for 1:2 ratio in 30 seconds. And after dialing in properly, from last 3 days I've achieved that golden shot consistently. And I can tell you the sourness is completely gone. 
So fellow nerds, if you haven't gotten a grinder yet, get it 
Finally I can say/ believe grinder is more important than the machine.",1,1756411317.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False
1n2mms3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1n2mms3/went_from_chipotle_runs_to_actually_feeling/,went from Chipotle runs to actually feeling disciplined in college,"A few months into college. I was just surviving on Chipotle, coffee, and whatever snacks I could grab between classes, and honestly, I was feeling like crap. My grades were okay, but I knew I could do better. My energy was low, my room was messy and there was no sequence for anything.

I decided to make a change. First, I started meal prepping. Instead of spending ten dollars every lunch on burritos, I cooked for myself a few times a week. It was actually kind of fun experimenting with recipes, and I saved money too. That extra cash made me think about my finances, which I had completely ignored until then. I set up a fizz card to track my spending and start building my credit responsibly. Seeing exactly where my money was going made a bigger difference than I expected and motivated me to be smarter with my budget.

Next, I focused on working out. Before, I would always say I would go laterbut  I never did. I started with short, consistent sessions in my dorm or at the campus gym. Even just twenty minutes made me feel more energised and focused in class.

Studying got better too. I started blocking out time. I planned my week, reviewed notes daily, and took breaks that didn’t involve scrolling Insta. Productivity started feeling like a habit instead of a chore.

It’s still a work in progress and I procrastinate, but seeing all the small wins stack up, the meals I prepped, the workouts I didn’t skip, and my money tracked with credit improving feels really good. I don’t miss just surviving on burritos.

If anyone else is struggling with college chaos and wants to get their life in order, start small. Meal prep one week, plan study sessions, and track your spending. Little wins really add up, which will eventually make you productive and better.

1n2mlpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReddXReads/comments/1n2mlpo/tales_of_community_college_artlad_vs_goodfella_vs/,Tales of Community College: Artlad vs Goodfella vs Sourface (part 7),"Hello Jerry Army, Bean-bois and Beardy Scientists! I'm back with another part of this saga. So I looked back to my journals and even though it was written in my Molly-addled haze, we're starting to enter to one of my biggest mistakes I've ever done. Don't worry, this part is mostly me being cringe-y and after this part, is my 20th birthday WHOOOO!

Where we last left off was Artlad, Bestbro and I were helping Sourface find the perfect outfit to get a lady friend. But will he get lucky? Will he score?

**First, the people in this!**

**Dizzy:** That's me, the 19 year old trans-man pill popper ready to once again party.

**Artlad:** The 19 year old party dude who knows the ""best"" parties to go to.

**Bestbro:** The 19 year old dad-friend of the group. Let's just say he'll end up helping by the end.

**Bestgal:** The 19 year old girlfriend of Bestbro and became the mother-hen in this part.

**Sourface:** The 21 year old ready to score a ""baddie"". This time he's innocent in this and he too suffered some cringe. More then anyone else.

**Fey:** The 27 year old with a job and the ""helper"".

**Goodfella:** The 18 year old who wants to ""help"".

**TIME TO PARTY!!!**

So I'm starting this off by answering the text I got after the little shopping trip for Sourface. The text I've gotten made my heart skip a beat, but in a bad way. It's was Fey! The text was something in the lines of ""I heard you're going to a party with your friends. Me and Goodfella are stopping by for a quick drink. Goodfella got the info from someone named Artlad? See you there \[fellow by a kissing emoji\]""

I don't remember telling Goodfella my plans nor telling why I was going to that party. So this brings us to the night of the party and dear god, there's way more people this time around. In-between the shopping trip and the party, I've just been going to work with Sr. Cholo and staying home, texting back and forth with Artlad about ""operation: get Sourface laid!"" or something like that. So I did look forward to underage drinking. This time, I made an effort to my outfit as well. In hindsight maybe a little too much effort, remember I had a huge ""crush"" on Big Billy, the fat frat-boy party host. I wore leather boots, semi-tight dark jeans, a black 3/4 sleeved shirt that covered my body so I could look more boyish and a black beanie. The reason I remember this outfit clearly is because Artlad wore the same outfit as me. Down to the same boots. I was mortified but Artlad thought is was funniest thing. Mortified cuz I chose that outfit for someone who probably isn't gay and Artlad want to try out being ""emo"" AGAIN. As we walked in, meeting up with Bestbro and Bestgal, both started to laugh at us and called us the ""emo twins"". That's when Sourface entered the party along side Beanpole and Cubby. Sourface was wearing the first outfit we found, the one with the kimono-style cardigan. He did look good but I would be a little embarrassed if my stomach was showing a little. But if Sourface think it's fine then it's fine and boy did he show off! He walked like his shit didn't stink. He had THE biggest smile I've ever seen, Sourface didn't have a sour face. I feel like Cubby and Beanpole was only invited to make Sourface look better by comparison but my pals and I only have one mission! Help Sourface get a girlfriend or at less get laid!

Sourface walked towards us and he smelled really good too. He put so much effort so looking back I feel like a dick for what happens later on.

**Bestbro: Wow, you actually came with that on!**

**Artlad: You look ready to bang!**

**Bestgal: How do you feel? That cardigan is actually your color!**

**Sourface: I feel so alpha! But I have bone to pick with Dizzy!**

**Me: Huh? Why me?**

**Sourface: My brother is here! This was my night!**

**Artlad: Dizzy before you ask, I didn't do it!**

**Me: Sourface, who care about your brother. What matters is you get that girl.**

**Bestgal: Huh? Getting what girl?**

Artlad tells her the plan about Sourface and she just rolls her eyes. Tells us that ""this is the dumbest plan I've ever heard"" to which Bestbro tell her that it was all Artlad's idea. I had the idea to scope the party for one: booze and two: for own selfishness, talk to Big Billy and find other people to get pills. As I grab a beer from the frat-house kitchen, I could hear Artlad shout at me to bring them drinks. Carrying beers to them, I see Goodfella and Fey talking to other people but they see me and give a look of ""*hey there\~*"". Okay weird, whatever. Y'all, I guess Artlad knows what he's doing cuz Sourface is talking to this really pretty girl, like 9/10 hot. I give everybody their drinks and the girl looks at me and says:

**Hottie: Wow, you're...matching with him?**

**Artlad: Haha yeah we're matching but don't worry, he's gay!**

Oh sure Artlad, that's make the difference /s.

I introduce myself and asked her if she wanted a drink so I don't fuck this up. Dude, this is when I knew that this girl is a major bitch cuz the way she talking screamed ""my mom and dad never said no"", she even snap her fingers at me. My inner Mexican father was fighting to not get the *chancla*! I asked Artlad if I could talk to him, alone. Back at the kitchen we're talking.

**Me: Dude what's her deal?**

**Artlad: What? She's not that bad, plus I know she has the same tastes as Sourface's family!**

**Me: I know she's hot but if it's just a lay, why does it matter about her tastes?**

**Artlad: Uhhhh....I don't know.**

**Me: Also what do you mean by tastes?**

**Artlad: OH! Sourface and this girl started talking right? At first she wasn't giving him the time but then he started talking about how he's taking over the family business and that's when she was like ""OMG you have money?""**

**Me: Uhhhhh, isn't that a red flag?**

**Artlad: Maybe but who cares, he's probably not getting a girlfriend here, I'm hoping he'll score.**

To that, I just chugged a beer and grab another one cuz I'm way too sober for this mess and I need to be at less buzzed to not give a shit. Who's taking advantage of who? Who cares! Bring the Tecate! Can't hear you over this Corona! So we walk back, with her drink, and talk. Ok well, try to talk because Hottie and Sourface are the only ones talking and the rest of us were just watching in awe.

**Hottie: How much money does your dad make?**

**Sourface: A lot! Soon when I take over, I'll be making way more then him! He doesn't know how to play the young man's game.**

**Hottie: Do you have money now?**

**Sourface: Duh!? I have a F-150! I bought it right a way! I'm not paying bills on a truck!**

**Hottie: OMG! Can you buy me stuff that I want?**

**Sourface: Only if work for it\~**

Ok ok, this isn't word for word but the vibe is the same. Sourface was showing off his folks' money as if he earn it. He was smiling as if having a gold digger ""hit on you"" because you showed off ""wealth"" was a flex. But, this is a college party, why is she here, in my drunken mind I asked.

**Me: So what's your major?**

**Hottie: Huh?**

**Me: What's your major. You know, what are you studying?**

**Hottie: Oh I'm studying art but it's whatever.**

**Me: Why?**

**Hottie: That only reason I'm studying art is so my daddy would give me my allowance.**

**Bestbro: A-A-Allowance?**

**Hottie: Yeah! He's such a dick though! He doesn't understand that I'm to pretty to work but whatever, I only date men with money.**

**Me: You don't have to answer but how much IS your allowance?**

**Hottie: Not enough to maintain my lifestyle before starting college!**

**Bestbro: how much?**

**Hottie: $3,000!**

**Artlad, Bestbro, Bestgal: $3,000?!**

**Me: Like a month?**

**Hottie: NO YOU STUPID \[r-word\] $3,000 a week!**

Fucking rich girls! This girl is getting $12,000 a month and it's not enough?! But this is where it gets good. You see Sourface and Goodfella DID came from money but not fuck-you money, so as I glance at Sourface, he was sweating bullets and giving everyone the ""help me"" eyes. I texted him, saying just keep lying until he gets laid. I regret asking that question cuz this caused her to be more open about her wants and she didn't not hide the fact she likes nice things. Sourface, in his smug-ness, told her that ""he'll cover the rest of her lifestyle if she does what he wants"" which cause the battle of entitlement between the two. In my regret, I drank beer after beer, shot and after shot cuz I didn't know what to do. We however been saved by Big Billy calling everybody to play ""pack mule"".

I'm sure there's many names to this game but is were someone duck-tapes two bottles of 40oz of beer, one each hand and the first one to finish both wins. Artlad volunteers to do it but to my horror, he also volunteered ME as well, stating ""since we're dress like twins, why not!"" I wanted to say something but my spine didn't shine that time and Big Billy sang praises at me and being the little gay shit that I am with my gay little crush on him, made me say fuck it. With two Coors bottles taped onto my hands, everybody cheering and with Big Billy's ""go"", I started chugging! I placed 4th while Artlad placed 2nd. But I was starting to feel beyond buzzed. I world around me started to spin but I didn't care and I drank MORE! Meanwhile Sourface was still trying to sleep with Hottie, she however was trying her best to have Sourface pony-up some money. Bestgal came up to me saying ""uhh Dizzy, I think you passed your limit"" but being the drunk bastard I said nah I'm fine and continue to drink more. At same point Goodfella and Fey tried to talk to me but I don't remember what about. But I DO remember Sourface walked up to me asking ""where's Artlad?"" I answered I don't know, why but he goes on and on how she wants money and yelled at him for trying to sleep with her and what not. Being too drunk and my dumbass drunkenly said ""just tell her you'll give her money if she sleeps with you"". Sourface like that idea and waddles off. Some time passed and I vaguely remember me standing on top of a coffee table, yelling at the top of my lungs ""WHHOOOO! I'M SOOOO DRUNK!"" and people cheering and Bestbro trying to get me down but not before Sourface getting mad me and saying that I need to fix something while Hottie is yelling at him. Artlad was trying to help Sourface, Sourface trying to stop Hottie from leaving, Hottie was yelling, Bestgal was trying to help Hottie and Bestbro was trying to get me to drink some water.

This next part, you might want to skip if you're eating and/or easily grossed out. You have been warned.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

As we're being a hot mess at a frat-party I started to feel ""off"". To note the coffee table was about no more then a foot off the ground and I'm 5'8"". Why am I writing this? Well everybody was gathered around me when I started to feel ""green"". Bestbro was trying with all his might to get me down by pulling my arm but Sourface was having none of it and was trying to have me fix whatever is going on with him and Hottie. He too was pulling my other arm. You see where this is going right? As both Sourface and Bestbro were playing tag of war with my arms, I just vomit and I vomit a lot. Do you know what's the worst part? Hottie was about a foot shorter then me and me being a foot off the ground, I projectile vomit right on top of her head. Both Sourface and Bestbro let go of my arms and steps away from the river of vomit. I continue to projectile booze and basically my entire stomach content and poor Hottie's head, face and chest was covered in my vomit. I fall backwards and pass-out to the sound of Hottie's scream.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

I fall backwards and pass out after that horrible display. I woke up in the ER getting my stomach pumped cuz I got alcohol poisoning. As I came to, Artlad and Bestbro were panicking and Bestgal was trying to calm them down. Picture having your friends creating chaos right next to your limp body when the nurse said they come in to see you cuz you're fine. To make a long story short, as soon as I sober up the hospital was asking how I'm going to pay the bill. Bestgal said to call my folks, I said ""hell nah!"" and I just bish cry to the billing lady to give me a payment plan since I'm a college student and blah blah. Now I have to get the mail before anyone else so I don't get in trouble and now I'll be really short on money. I made my way back home, trying not to wake anyone up and I just crash, I woke up around noon and I feel like crap. I got up, made myself coffee and I checked my phone to see I got a text from Sourface. He called me a fucking asshole, I ruin his chance and how dare I vomit on his future wife. Yes he called her his future wife when I'm pretty sure she didn't give a fuck about him. I also got a text from Bestgal asking if I want to come by to the old diner we use go to back in high school. I texted sure cuz I need some pancakes for my hungover. I made it the diner and only Bestgal was and she told everything I've told you guys. She also told me that Artlad and Bestbro had catch me when I fall down. I was horrified, if you read the gross part you'll know why I feel like an asshole. I asked if there's anything I can do to fix this and her face said it all. With a weak ""no sorry"" and I asked so many questions about that night. I drank so much I must have block a lot. Everything I've written here is what Bestgal had said, Bestgal asked how I was going to pay the hospital bill, will my cousin find out? To put it simply, I just told her that I'll make sure my cousin will never find out cuz how the hell to I explain ""hey cousin! I had to go to the ER right after I vomit on a poor girl! also the bill is worth at least four of your paychecks"" no I did this to myself, so imma eat the cost. Bestgal could tell that there's more and I think she's starting to pick my pill problem but she stop asking questions after our food arrived.

As we're eating, what Bestgal said next made me stop mid-bite:

**Bestgal: So I got a random message from social media from a guy named Fey**

**Me: Huh? What did he say?**

**Bestgal: Well he asked if I was friends with you and that he knows you.**

**Me: I know someone named Fey but is it the same one?** (I'm trying to play dumb)

**Bestgal: Here let show you the profile pic.**

Sure enough, it was THE Fey we all knew. I mean I knew right a way but I didn't want it to be true.

**Me: Oh yeah I know him. He's Goodfella's friend. Remember?**

**Bestgal: Well, he kinda gave off a bad vibe.**

**Me: What do you mean?**

**Bestgal: Did you know he was at the party right?**

**Me: Yeah.**

**Bestgal: Well uhhh...you know what, all I'm going to say is that he wants you to call him.**

**Me: o....kay....**

She look uncomfortable when talking about Fey. I found it odd he went out of his way to contact a friend of mine for whatever reason. But it's been a hot minute since I've talked to Fey and Goodfella since moving back. I told Bestgal to not to worry and made a mental note to call Fey. But I ""had"" to go to Artlad's place because Bestgal told me Sourface is throwing a big fuss about and to be fair I had a hand of ruining the mood. So I did handed to Artlad's apartment and as soon as I entered Sourface just went off!

**Sourface: You fucking asshole! You fucking ruined my night!**

**Me: I know I know! I feel so bad!**

**Artlad: Dude, I can't believe you just vomit on her! She ended up crying!**

**Me: Ohhhhh god....**

**Artlad: Also me and Bestbro had to drag your butt to the hospital. You weren't responding to our voices.**

**Sourface: I can't believe you passed out! That's so unfair! I had the brunt of that's girl's yelling! I was so close!**

**Me: I can't face anyone in that party! I'm never going to one of Big Billy's party ever again!**

I literally curled up into a fetal-position on Artlad's couch with my hoodie pulled over my eyes and I just wanted the ground to shallow me whole. Of course, Sourface was having none of that he pull me from my hoodie and made me face him.

**Sourface: You need to fix this!**

**Me: HOW?!**

**Sourface: Artlad said that fucking frat house is having a Christmas party and it's your job to get me a girlfriend!**

**Me: What the fuck! NO! Just because I did that to the poor girl doesn't mean shit!**

**Sourface: Fuck you! You kicked my nose! You insulted me! And now you cockblocked me!? What kind of sick game are playing here!?**

**Artlad: Hey hey whoa whoa hey! Sourface, Dizzy didn't even help at the party! Also that girl obviously wasn't down to clown dude!**

**Me: I feel bad enough for I did and I don't need you in my face just because you didn't get laid.**

**Sourface: Pfft whatever! All women always go for skinny asshole like Artlad and not nice guys like me!**

**Artlad: Dude come on!**

**Me: Artlad please be real! You do honest to god believe us helping Sourface is a good idea?**

**Artlad: What do you mean?**

**Me: Maybe it's best if I step down from helping.**

**Sourface: GOOD! For once you thought for something smart.**

**Artlad: But Dizzy....**

**Me: It's fine Artlad, is like you always say I hate talking to people anyway and it's better someone sociable to do this.**

This may sound so dramatic but it really wasn't. It was mostly Artlad, Sourface and I recovering from our hangovers and Sourface did pull me from my hoodie but it wasn't a hard pull, more like a tug. The vibe is more like dudes mumbling and airing out feelings then a full blown argument. Artlad just shrugged and asked if Sourface wanted to try again at the incoming Christmas party. Of course Sourface said yes but not before he aired his ""disappointment"" of his brother came to the party last night. Now here's the reason why I'm not helping Sourface at the next party. One: I'm embarrassed from what I did. Two: That party is conflicting with my time with my family. That week I wanted to send time with my family and basically after that is my birthday week. Also, I've been around with too many people and I need some RnR.

As I was leaving Artlad's place, I get a call from Fey. I pick up and before I say 'hello' he starts talking.

**Fey: Hey Dizzy! I was wondering if you're up for hanging out with me and Goodfella tonight?**

**Me: Uhhhh.....sure I guess, where to?**

**Fey: Le Parfait!**

So the rest of this is me going ""huh?"" and him explaining that Le Parfait is a gay bar that's popular in that college town. Mainly cuz it's the only gay bar in town. (p.s. that not the bar's actual name and I didn't want to show the real name cuz it'll reveal where I live. But it's within the similar ""French"" writing"")

Here's one problem, they carded you at the door and Goodfella and I are under 21. What's Fey's solution? Fake IDs of course. To be fair, the IDs Fey gotten for us look real, like DMV quality. All I have to do is meet up with him and his buddy to take my picture. I'm speedrunning this again cuz not important and I want to jump straight to the cringe. So we're at the front of the bar, the bouncer looking at both mine's and Goodfella's ""IDs"", he give both us a look, shrugs and let us in. Again I don't really remember most of this cuz I semi-remember popping more pills then ever, and Fey ordered bottle service and we sat at a booth and they started talking about the party.

**Goodfella: I hope you can handle booze right now.**

**Me: Why are asking that? Of course I can.**

**Fey: You're not going to turn into a water sprinkler like last night right?**

**Me:** \*hiding my face into my hands\* **Don't remind me! I still feel hella bad!**

**Fey: Don't worry about it, I have something plan.**

**Goodfella: like?**

**Fey: Look around you.**

I remember the bar not being that crowded but what I did note is a lot of men wearing a lot of leather. Remember, I just came out and still new to LGBTQ+ culture at the time, I didn't put two and two together that it was leather night at Le Parfait. The bartender arrived with two bottles of wine and some glasses and that's when things got ""good"". As Fey was pouring wine, he asked:

**Fey: So do you know why we wanted to hang out with you Dizzy?**

**Me: To.....hang right? Simply grab a drink.**

**Goodfella:** \*giggles\* **Oh Dizzy, you're soooo naïve. Look around again, there's a reason for tonight.**

**Me:** \*eye roll\* **Look dude, just because I just came out doesn't mean I'm a baby who knows nothing.  I know leather is some kind of thing.**

**Fey: Oh I know you're not 100% innocent. Since you've been giving googly eyes to the frat-host last night.**

**Me: Uhhhhhhh.....look I know ok, I'm trying not to- I'm not forcing- LOOK! This is new to me ok! I don't know how to handle these new feelings.**

My face was flashed with embarrassment, I knew it was weird and boarding on creepy and I knew I had to change this. I guess drunk me was obvious about my feelings about Big Billy but I was confused is to why Fey wanted to butt-in. Oh! Right, he's the elder gay duh /s.

**Fey: Look, every queer person had a crush at some point where you know it's not going to happen.**

**Goodfella: And since you're helping my brother get a girlfriend, we figured something similar**

**Me: Used to. I decided to leave it to Artlad since he's better when it comes to this. Also what do you mean by ""something similar""?**

**Fey: Dizzy, have you gotten uhhhh ""lucky"" since starting college?**

**Me: L-L-Lucky? I don't-**

**Goodfella: Don't be coy Dizzy. You know what we mean.**

That triggered virgin panic. I tried to tell them, stammering, that I feel I wasn't ready since I One: barely started transitioning and Two: at this point I haven't even held hands with anyone. When I was still presenting as a girl, nobody cared if I was still a virgin but since I started to look more and more masculine, that talk seem to pop-up more and more. Honestly, it's fucking weird and kinda personal to air out. The reason I'm typing this is for context. The more we drank too, the more they seem to push me into talking to one of the guys in the bar. ""lose your V-card"" they say and me hating my still feminine body, yeah no, I wasn't okay with this. However, no matter how many times I try to interject, they would try to convince me to ""give it a shot"" and ""the worst thing they say is no"". It's not the rejection I'm worried about, no is the fact is I. AM. NOT. READY! once again, red flags are waving and I ignored them. Goodfella then got up and headed to the bar saying ""wait here"" and left before I could say anything, not that I could with both of them cutting me off before I gave an opinion. Goodfella came back with a guy in-tow. He was a BIG man too. He had to be 6'6"" and maybe around 450lbs (204kgs) of both fat and muscle and from head to toe was wearing nothing but leather and he was very hairy too. To say I was fearful was putting it lightly. Goodfella introduce us to him and he introduce himself as ""Ted"". The way he spoke, mismatch the way he look, don't get me wrong his voice did have some gruff and testosterone to it but in a way softer way. It's like when a guy says he's alpha but Ted exuded it. No words needed.

Goodfella then goes ""Oh! You see my friend over here"" as he pointed at me, ""he's interested getting to know someone uhh 'fun' if you know I mean"". Then he winks at me. Ted found this amusing, Fey was just smirking and I was in the dark cuz everybody but me knows what he means! Ted then slides down the booth to sit next to me, resting his arm right above me, saying that hope we didn't mind joining us, of course Fey and Goodfella said it was fine while I froze. Not because I was panicking, but more out of shyness. Picture a 5'8"" young-looking dude who's no more then 180lbs (82kgs) being cornered by a 6'6"", 450lbs (204kgs) hairy dude in leather. I tried to make small talk, but he slowly place his arm around me, and his big hand was resting right on my shoulder. As the booze kicked in, he, easily, pull me closer to him. I tense up. Everybody just giggled and saying ""relax Dizzy! you need to have fun!"" and ""Sooooo naïve!"" and to finish off with Ted going ""first time with someone into leather?"" I just shot up saying that I need to use the restroom to freshen up and quickly bolted. I entered the restroom, lock it, and just hunched over the toilet and vom. See guys, I learned from last time /j. Jokes aside, I was panicking and wanted an out. So, I texted Bestgal to call me in ten minutes and fake an emergency so I can leave. What ever Fey and Goodfella had planned, I wasn't ready for it. I cleaned up and head back to them, and the MVP that is Bestgal, right on cue, she called and really played the ""I need your help with family stuff and it's bad"". I excuse myself, drop $40 on the table and left.

As I was riding the train back home, I called Bestgal back thanking her for her help. I know the gay stereotype about being horny or whatever, but at this time I wasn't ready to engage in that and I know being 19 and it's your best college years but this wasn't it. This felt forced and like Fey and Goodfella had a ""thing"" to this. But I push that shit aside cuz a soon as I entered my room, I started to pack up for my birthday! Since it's being held in my Uncle's place in NorCal, I was planning to stay there for a few days. I send a text in the group chat about the invites and if they're up for it and where will be held. I get a text from Fey saying how ""sad I had to leave when it was getting good"" and ""Goodfella has already a plan b ;)"". I just reply with ""sorry"" and continue with my night.

To end this, I'm just going to add that I didn't go to the next party Big Billy was hosting cuz I couldn't face anyone after what I did, Fey and Goodfella want me to hang out with them again but I had the perfect excuse that I have a job and my boss didn't allow one too many call offs (which was true, Sr Cholo is every strict when it comes to that stuff). So the next part of this saga, we'll being starting of my 20th birthday!

Thank you so much for reading, I know I haven't been posting sooner but life got in the way and I'm writing these when I have free time. Also sorry if this is all over the place, my mind blocked a lot from time for some reason but for sure I remember the rest of this saga.

1n2mj55,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Official/comments/1n2mj55/inspired_by_the_srank_discussion_i_deepdived_and/,"Inspired by the S-Rank discussion, I deep-dived and designed a full character concept. What do you guys think?","Hey fellow Proxies,

I've been playing ZZZ for a couple of months now, and like many of you, I'm completely hooked. The world, the vibe, the characters... it just feels like home. I even built a new PC for it, so yeah, you could say I'm pretty invested!

Lately, I've been seeing a lot of the community discussion about the balance of S-Rank characters (male-females), and it got my imagination running wild. I started daydreaming about a character who could not only bring something new to the gameplay but also have a backstory that many of us could really connect with.

It started as a small idea, but it snowballed into this massive concept that I'm genuinely excited about, and I wanted to share it with the only people who would get it—all of you. So, grab a coffee, this is a bit of a read, but I hope you enjoy it.

# The Concept: An Male S-Rank Fire Agent with a Katana    *(1)

The core idea is a male agent who feels like a true ""main character"" not because he's loud, but because he has a quiet, powerful presence. Think Miyabi's discipline, but with a different kind of wisdom born from a more grounded, relatable struggle.

**1. Backstory & Vibe**

Instead of a huge, cinematic tragedy that's hard to relate to, his pain comes from something many of us might understand on some level: a difficult childhood with extremely strict, demanding parents. This didn't break him, but it forged him into someone incredibly mature, disciplined, and calm. He's serious, not because he's cold, but because he understands the weight of actions and words.

He carries that ""main character energy"" effortlessly. He doesn't seek respect, but his demeanor commands it. He's the type of person who is always observing, always thinking, and when he speaks, it's with purpose.

**2. Personality**

* **Calm & Serious:** He's the anchor in a storm. Polite and respectful, but doesn't waste time with meaningless talk. When he does crack a joke, it's rare, perfectly timed, and meaningful.
* **Disciplined:** His every movement is precise, a result of relentless self-training. He's a believer in ""hard life quotes,"" but he doesn't just say them; he lives them.
* **Open-Minded:** He quietly disagrees with the bureaucratic ""fake glory"" of factions like H.S.O.S. He's not an aggressive rebel, but he sees the truth behind the curtain and operates on his own code of honour. \*(2)

**3. Appearance**

* **Height:** Around 5′8"" (173cm). He believes skill isn't measured in height and proves that agility and maneuverability are a huge advantage.
* **Physique:** A fit, ""sleeper build."" He doesn't look like a bodybuilder, but his physique is clearly that of an elite fighter.
* **Style:** A mix of modern and traditional Japanese street style. Mainly black and white, with a single, sharp colour detail, like a red cord or emblem.
* **Weapon:** A sleek, black katana. A symbol of his discipline and precision.

**4. Gameplay & Combat**

* **Element: Fire.** Let's be honest, Fire could use a top-tier powerhouse, especially since so many enemies are weak to it. He would wield black-and-red flames.
* **Playstyle:** Fast, precise, and with a high skill ceiling. Think breathtakingly cool and badass animations.
* **Unique Mechanics:** Maybe his 'E' skill has different effects on a single press, a double tap, or holding it down? His dodge could be an offensive move, allowing him to phase through an attack and strike from behind. His Ultimate would be a cinematic flurry of fiery katana strikes that is just pure art.

\----------------------------

Okay, so that's the idea that's been living in my head.

I know how game development works, and I know we can't just email HoYoverse and make this happen. But a guy can dream, right? My ultimate hope would be for an idea like this to one day become real.

But what if we, as a community, could bring him to life in our own way? This is where I'd love for you all to come in. This post isn't just me sharing; it's an invitation.

* **To the Artists:** What do you think he would look like? I am not an artist myself, but I have a very clear vision in my head. If anyone feels inspired and would be willing to help visualize him with a sketch or a full piece, that would be absolutely incredible.
* **To the Writers & Lore Masters:** What kind of scenarios could he be in? How would he interact with the Cunning Hares or Section 6? Let's write a story for him.
* **To Everyone:** What would you name him? What are some cool voice lines he'd have? What would you add or change?

Let's make this a community project. Let's build this character together.

Thank you for taking the time to read my massive wall of text. I'm just so passionate about this game and its potential, and I wanted to share that with all of you.

Let me know what you think!



**subnotes: \*(1):** i though that a Katana would be a good pair, since the katana is not just a blade, but a honorable sword, also in game only Miyabi have a katana and i know there are different types of katana and blades.

1n2mitc,https://www.reddit.com/r/askMRP/comments/1n2mitc/changing_in_dynamics_or_just_being_autistic/,Changing in dynamics or just being autistic?,"Last night there was an interesting (seemingly?) change in dynamics after an initiation. This has not happened to me before and I wanted to present the situation here to get some feedback and understand what’s going on.

For additional context of my situation, here’s my two most recent OYS: [OYS 6-7](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriedredpill/comments/1mucphd/comment/n9kvn1t/?context=3), [OYS 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriedredpill/comments/1n0gamd/comment/nasfdgk/?context=3)

I was wrapping up my nightly treadmill walk/gaming when the treadmill broke (sidebar: looking for foldable treadmill recs). I went and showered/got ready for bed. I came back downstairs and the fiancé was sitting on the ground doing some arts & crafts at the coffee table. I sat on the couch behind her to do some motor troubleshooting. After I confirmed the motor was fucked, I sat up and said I was going to bed. I leaned over and gave her a 10-second kiss, which was well received, as had been the other 5-6 instances of KINO throughout the day.

The conversation went like this:

>**MIB:** I’ve changed my mind, come up here. \*reaches for fiancé’s hand\*

>**Fiancé:** \*sigh\* Uh, you said you were going bed.

>**MIB:** You’re right but that was nice and I’ve changed my mind. \*now holding her hand to help her up\*

>**Fiancé:** \*looking resigned\* But you said you were going to bed.

>**MIB:** STFU

>**Fiancé:** \*sighs again\* Alright.

>**MIB:** \*let’s go of hand\* That’s ok, no big deal. I’ll be upstairs reading in bed and will see you in a bit.

>**Fiancé:** \*sad/confused\* Wait, I said I’ll have sex with you. 

>**MIB:** It’s all good. You don’t want to have sex and I don’t want to have sex with you if you don’t want to have sex with me. That’s no fun for either of us. I’ll be upstairs. \*kisses forehead and goes upstairs\*

I went upstairs and was going to read until I saw what time it was. It was too late to read anymore so I turned out the lights and tried to sleep. 

The fiancé came up 20 mins later and stood in the doorway. I thought I heard steps so I rolled over to look and there she was. She was surprised I was asleep instead of reading. She hopped in bed next to me, reached for my cock, and started semi-enthusiastically stroking it. The conversation continued:

>**Fiancé:** I thought about what you said for a little bit and decided to come up here. I was surprised you were asleep. 

>**MIB:** What about what I said were you thinking about?

>**Fiancé:** Just what you said.

>**MIB:** I don’t understand, which part were you thinking about?

>**Fiancé:** Well my period is about to start so I thought I’d come upstairs to you.

>**MIB:** I see that, but I still don’t understand what you were thinking about. Did you come up here to fuck me because you felt bad or because we aren’t going to fuck for another week? 

>(\*\*\*context: one of the times she fucked me the week before she stated she did so because she felt bad about turning me down\*\*\*)

>**Fiancé:** No, it’s not that. Why wait a week? Don’t you want to earn your red wings?

>**MIB:** Hah, that’s funny but no. Not really my style, thanks. I don’t want to have sex if you’re doing it because you feel bad about what happened downstairs. 

>**Fiancé:** Why are you ruining this with questions? You’re not even hard yet.

>**MIB:** I guess you’ll have to try harder (\*smirk\*, pun intended). You’re right, we’re talking too much. Let’s enjoy the moment. (\*grabs back of fiancé’s head and starts kissing)

Kissing goes to BJ, BJ goes to sex, semi-enthusiastic sex for 10ish mins then bust my nut. She lays down on top of me afterwards for about 5 mins and I stroke her hair, scratch her back, hug her - like I’m supposed to. She gets up, cleans the both of us up and starts putting on her clothes to finish her arts & crafts project. Conversation continues:

Fiancé: I just want you to know that I made a conscious decision to come up here. I didn’t want you to think I was lame.

>**MIB:** Why would you think I’d say you were lame?

>**Fiancé:** That’s not what I said. You’re putting words in my mouth and projecting on to me. \*sounding frustrated\*

>**MIB:** Oh, I see. Well I’m pretty tired and I’m going to sleep. Good night.

>**Fiancé:** \*goes downstairs\*

The fiancé hasn’t done this before and is a change in dynamics from the 4-5 hard nos I’ve been receiving for some time now. Once time is not a trend, but I thought the event was substantial enough to warrant this post.

Generally, I was trying to be/being OI by turning down starfish sex (1/10) because I didn’t want to caveman through shitty sex. I wasn’t upset or cold but was nonchalant/aloof about the rejection. She was sighing and looked resigned at the start and came upstairs intent on fucking and initiated/fucked with more enthusiasm than usual (top 5 fuck in the last 12 months). So what would have been starfish sex with my initiation turned into 5/10 semi-enthusiastic sex with her initiating .

Is this a change in power dynamics, or heading in the direction towards flipping? Or am I being an over analyzing austist reading too far into a one-time ordeal?

*Final fun note: I’m pretty sure I was playing SM2 with* u/RolloTomassi *last night (although the tag was missing a second S). If so, thanks for the revives. TEP.*

1n2mifa,https://www.reddit.com/r/soc2/comments/1n2mifa/what_is_an_acceptable_use_policy_aup_best/,What is an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)? Best Practices and Template,"

*I created this article to help those looking to write an effective AUP for their organization.*

*Folks, feel free to provide feedback on your AUP experiences or additional best practices you've discovered!*

Think of your Acceptable Use Policy as a friendly roadmap that helps your team navigate technology use confidently and securely. Rather than a list of restrictions, a well-crafted AUP is actually an empowering document that gives employees clarity on what they can do, how to do it safely, and why it matters for everyone's success.

A good AUP serves as a starting point for employees to understand expectations around technology use, protects both the company and individuals, and creates a foundation of trust that enables better business relationships with clients and partners.

# The 6 Components Every AUP Must Include

# 1. Clear Scope and Applicability

Start by clearly defining who this policy helps and what systems it covers. This creates clarity rather than confusion.

**Example approach:** ""This policy applies to all team members, contractors, and partners who access our company systems, helping everyone understand how to use our technology resources safely and effectively.""

# 2. Device and Network Security Guidelines

Your team works from various locations: home offices, coworking spaces, coffee shops. Your AUP should provide helpful guidance for staying secure everywhere.

**Key areas to address:**

* Guidelines for personal use (reasonable and realistic)
* Software installation recommendations
* Wi-Fi security tips for remote work

# 3. Communication and Collaboration Best Practices

Help your team understand how to communicate professionally while representing the company well.

**Include guidance on:**

* What information can be shared externally
* Professional communication standards
* Social media guidelines that protect both personal and company interests

# 4. Internet and Email Guidelines

Based on your reference document, this section should balance business needs with reasonable personal use.

**Key principles:**

* Business use is primary, reasonable personal use is acceptable
* Professional communication standards
* Security-conscious browsing practices

**From your document:** Personal use is permitted when it doesn't affect business performance, doesn't create security threats, and stays within reasonable bounds.

# 5. Remote Work and Privacy Guidelines

Since most teams work remotely at least part-time, provide clear, helpful guidance for maintaining security and privacy off-site.

**Essential elements:**

* Creating appropriate work environments
* Protecting company equipment and data
* Equipment security when traveling

**Positive approach:** ""When working remotely, choose environments that allow you to maintain confidentiality, this protects both our clients' trust and your professional reputation.""

# 6. Incident Reporting and Support

Frame this as a support system rather than a punishment mechanism.

**Include:**

* Who to contact for help (specific roles and contact methods)
* Resources available for support

**Supportive language:** ""If you encounter any security concerns or need guidance, our IT team is here to help. Quick reporting helps us address issues faster and protect everyone.""

# The 4 Biggest AUP Mistakes

# Mistake #1: The ""Everything is Forbidden"" Approach

I see policies that ban personal email, personal phone calls, and basically any human behavior. This doesn't make you more secure. It makes your policy irrelevant.

**Reality check:** Your sales team is going to check personal email. Your developers are going to Stack Overflow questions. Write policies that acknowledge real-world usage while protecting what matters.

# Mistake #2: Ignoring Remote Work Reality

Too many AUPs were written in 2015 when everyone worked in an office. If your policy doesn't address home offices, coworking spaces, and personal devices, it's worthless.

**Fix:** Explicitly address remote work scenarios. ""When working from locations outside company offices, employees must ensure their workspace is private during customer calls and lock their screen when stepping away.""

# Mistake #3: Making it Impossible to Find or Understand

I've seen huge AUPs buried in employee handbooks. I've seen policies written in legal language that require a law degree to understand.

**Solution:** Keep it simple, use plain English, and make it easily accessible. If employees can't find it or understand it, compliance is impossible.

# Mistake #4: Ignoring AI Tools

Your employees are already using AI tools like ChatGPT for writing, GitHub Copilot for coding, etc. Without clear guidelines, they're making decisions about what data is safe to share with AI systems, and those decisions might be putting your business at risk.

**Solution:** Clear AI guidelines prevent accidental data exposure that could violate customer contracts or compliance requirements.

1n2mcsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/servicenow/comments/1n2mcsn/after_all_of_servicenows_ai_attempts_it_took_an/,"After all of ServiceNow's AI attempts, it took an open-source MCP tool to actually make AI useful for ServiceNow development","So there I was, watching another Now Assist demo, thinking ""this is cool but... can it actually write my Widgets?"" Spoiler: it couldn't.

Fast forward a few weekends and too much coffee later - I somehow built an MCP orchestration tool that connects Claude Code to ServiceNow. Not to be dramatic, but it's basically everything I wished Now Assist would do 😅

# The ""I can't believe this works"" features

Remember when ServiceNow announced AI everything? Well, this little open-source project:

* Has 355+ ServiceNow APIs accessible through MCP (yes I counted, yes I'm proud)
* Actually understands that ServiceNow still uses ES5 JavaScript (Claude gets it!)
* Puts everything in Update Sets automatically (because we're professionals here)
* Generates working code, not philosophical discussions about code

It's giving major SN Utils energy - you know, that community tool we all have installed because the platform forgot we need it? 😉

# What it actually does (with examples!)

Me: ""Hey Claude, create a Business Rule that sends a Slack notification when a P1 incident is created"" Claude: Actually creates it, puts it in an Update Set, and it works Me: 😲

Also works for:

* Service Portal widgets (the painful ones with angular providers)
* Complex Script Includes
* Process mining workflows
* Background scripts that don't break production (hopefully)

# The slightly awkward part

I'm just one developer who got frustrated on a Tuesday. Meanwhile, ServiceNow has entire teams working on AI. But somehow... this works better for actual development?

Don't get me wrong - I LOVE ServiceNow. But it's kind of like when your mom tries to be cool and uses slang wrong. ServiceNow's AI feels like it's trying really hard to be helpful but doesn't quite get what we need day-to-day.

# Open source = we can make it even better!

This isn't a startup pitch or a ""please hire me"" post. It's genuinely open source and needs community love:

The project: That MCP thingy that shall not be named (check my profile) 📚 355 tools documented and ready 🤝 MIT licensed ☕ Powered by caffeine and mild frustration

How you can help:

* Test some of those 355 APIs (I definitely didn't test them all... who has time?)
* Tell me what APIs I forgot
* Find bugs (there are definitely bugs)
* Add documentation (mine is... functional)
* Just try it and roast me in the comments

# My totally realistic predictions

By Knowledge 2026:

1. ServiceNow announces something suspiciously similar
2. They'll call it ""Now Assist Pro Max Ultra""
3. It'll cost more than your house
4. We'll still be using the community version

But hey, until then - we've got this thing!

TL;DR: Made an AI tool for ServiceNow development that actually writes code. It's like if Now Assist and SN Utils had a baby. It's open source. I'm slightly scared it works this well. Please break it so I can fix it.

Edit: Yes it works with your ancient Jakarta instance, you beautiful disaster

Edit 2: For the person who asked if ServiceNow will sue me - they'd have to acknowledge it works better first 😏

Edit 3: My DMs are open if you need direct links or just want to share ServiceNow horror stories

Edit 4: Didn't knew I couldn't adjust my username after creation sooooo posting again under a diff account with the right username, mods please delete old one :)",2,1756410685.0,servicenow,5,0.67,False

Redmerski Free Read online,"NATALIE HAS BEEN TWIRLING that same lock of hair for the past ten minutes and it’s starting to drive me nuts. I shake my head and pull my iced latte toward me, strategically placing my lips on the straw. Natalie sits across from me with her elbows propped on the little round table, chin in one hand.  
  
  “He’s gorgeous,” she says staring off toward the guy who just got in line. “Seriously, Cam, would you look at him?”  
  
  I roll my eyes and take another sip. “Nat,” I say, placing my drink back on the table, “you have a boyfriend—do I need to constantly remind you?”  
  
  Natalie sneers playfully at me. “What are you, my mother?” But she can’t keep her eyes on me for long, not while that walking wall of sexy is standing at the register ordering coffee and scones. “Besides, Damon doesn’t care if I look—as long as I’m bending over for him every night, he’s good with it.”  
  
  I let out a spat of air, blushing.  
  
  “See! Uh huh,” she says, smiling hugely. “I got a laugh out of you.” She reaches over and thrusts her hand into her little purple purse. “I have to make note of that,” and she pulls out her phone and opens her digital notebook. “Saturday. June 15th.” She moves her finger across the screen. “1:54 p.m. – Camryn Bennett laughed at one of my sexual jokes.” Then she shoves the phone back inside her purse and looks at me with that thoughtful sort of look she always has when she’s about to go into therapy-mode. “Just look once,” she says, all joking aside.  
  
  Just to appease her, I turn my chin carefully at an angle so that I can get a quick glimpse of the guy. He moves away from the register and toward the end of the counter where he slides his drink off the edge. Tall. Perfectly sculpted cheekbones. Mesmerizing model green eyes and spiked up brown hair.  
  
  “Yes,” I admit, looking back at Natalie, “he’s hot, but so what?”  
  
  Natalie has to watch him leave out the double glass doors and glide past the windows before she can look back at me to respond.  
  
  “Oh. My. God,” she says eyes wide and full of disbelief.  
  
  “He’s just a guy, Nat.” I place my lips on the straw again. “You might as well put a sign that says ‘obsessed’ on your forehead. You’re everything obsessed short of drooling.”  
  
  “Are you kidding me?” Her expression has twisted into pure shock. “Camryn, you have a serious problem. You know that, right?” She presses her back against her chair. “You need to up your medication. Seriously.”  
  
  “I stopped taking it in April.”  
  
  “What? Why?”  
  
  “Because it’s ridiculous,” I say matter-of-factly. “I’m not suicidal, so there’s no reason for me to be taking it.”  
  
  She shakes her head at me and crosses her arms over her chest. “You think they prescribe that stuff just for suicidal people? No. They don’t.” She points a finger at me briefly and hides it back in the fold of her arm. “It’s a chemical imbalance thing, or some shit like that.”  
  
  I smirk at her. “Oh, really? Since when did you become so educated in mental health issues and the medications they use to treat the hundreds of diagnoses?” My brow rises a little, just enough to let her see how much I know she has no idea what she’s talking about.  
  
  When she wrinkles her nose at me instead of answering, I say, “I’ll heal on my own time and I don’t need a pill to fix it for me.” My explanation had started out kind, but unexpectedly turned bitter before I could get the last sentence out. That happens a lot.  
  
  Natalie sighs and the smile completely drops from her face.  
  
  “I’m sorry,” I say, feeling bad for snapping at her. “Look, I know you’re right. I can’t deny that I have some messed up emotional issues and that I can be a bitch sometimes—.”  
  
  “Sometimes?” she mumbles under her breath, but is grinning again and has already forgiven me.  
  
  That happens a lot, too.  
  
  I half-smile back at her. “I just want to find answers on my own, y’know?”  
  
  “Find what answers?” She’s annoyed with me. “Cam,” she says, cocking her head to one side to appear thoughtful. “I hate to say it, but shit really does happen. You just have to get over it. Beat the hell out of it by doing things that make you happy.”  
  
  OK, so maybe she isn’t so horrible at the therapy thing after all.  
  
  “I know, you’re right,” I say, “but….”  
  
  Natalie raises a brow, waiting. “What? Come on, out with it!”  
  
  I gaze toward the wall briefly, thinking about it. So often I sit around and think about life and wonder about every possible aspect of it. I wonder what the hell I’m doing here. Even right now. In this coffee shop with this girl I’ve known practically all my life. Yesterday I thought about why I felt the need to get up at exactly the same time as the day before and do everything like I did the day before. Why? What compels any of us to do the things we do when deep down a part of us just wants to break free from it all?  
  
  I look away from the wall and right at my best friend who I know won’t understand what I’m about to say, but because of the need to get it out, I say it anyway.  
  
  “Have you ever wondered what it would be like to backpack across the world?”  
  
  Natalie’s face goes slack. “Uh, not really,” she says. “That might…suck.”  
  
  “Well, think about it for a second,” I say, leaning against the table and focusing all of my attention on her. “Just you and a backpack with a few necessities. No bills. No getting up at the same time every morning to go to a job you hate. Just you and the world out ahead of you. You never know what the next day is going to bring, who you’ll meet, what you’ll have for lunch or where you might sleep.” I realize I’ve become so lost in the imagery that I might’ve seemed a little obsessed for a second, myself.  
  
  “You’re starting to freak me out,” Natalie says, eyeing me across the small table with a look of uncertainty. Her arched brow settles back even with the other one and then she says, “And there’s also all the walking, the risk of getting raped, murdered and tossed on the side of a freeway somewhere. Oh, and then there’s all the walking….”  
  
  Clearly, she thinks I’  
m borderline crazy.  
  
  “What brought this on, anyway?” she asks, taking a quick sip of her drink. “That sounds like some kind of mid-life-crisis stuff—you’re only twenty.” She points again as if to underline, “And you’ve hardly paid a bill in your life.”  
  
  She takes another sip; an obnoxious slurping noise follows.  
  
  “Maybe not,” I say thinking quietly to myself, “but I will be once I move in with you.”  
  
  “So true,” she says, tapping her fingertips on her cup. “Everything split down the middle—Wait, you’re not backing out on me, are you?” She sort of freezes, looking warily across at me.  
  
  “No, I’m still on. Next week I’ll be out of my mom’s house and living with a slut.”  
  
  “You bitch!” she laughs.  
  
  I half-smile and go back to my brooding, the stuff before that she wasn’t relating to, but I expected as much. Even before Ian died, I always kind of thought out-of-the-box. Instead of sitting around dreaming up new sex positions, as Natalie often does about Damon, her boyfriend of five years, I dream about things that really matter. At least in my world, they matter. What the air in other countries feels like on my skin, how the ocean smells, why the sound of rain makes me gasp. “You’re one deep chick.” That’s what Damon said to me on more than one occasion.  
  
  “Geez!” Natalie says. “You’re a freakin’ downer, you know that right?” She shakes her head with the straw between her lips.  
  
  “Come on,” she says suddenly and stands up from the table. “I can’t take this philosophical stuff anymore and quaint little places like this seem to make you worse—we’re going to The Underground tonight.”  
  
  “What?—No, I’m not going to that place.”  
  
  “Yes. You. Are.” She chucks her empty drink into the trash can a few feet away and grabs my wrist. “You’re going with me this time because you’re supposed to be my best friend and I won’t take no again for an answer.” Her close-lipped smile is spread across the entirety of her slightly tanned face.  
  
  I know she means business. She always means business when she has that look in her eyes: the one brimmed with excitement and determination. It’ll probably be easiest just to go this once and get it over with, or else she’ll never leave me alone about it. Such is a necessary evil when it comes to having a pushy best friend.  
  
  I get up and slip my purse strap over my shoulder.  
  
  “It’s only two o’clock,” I say.  
  
  I drink down the last of my latte and toss the empty cup away in the same trash can.  
  
  “Yeah, but first we’ve got to get you a new outfit.”  
  
  “Uh, no.” I say resolutely as she’s walking me out the glass doors and into the breezy summer air. “Going to The Underground with you is more than good deed enough. I refuse to go shopping. I’ve got plenty of clothes.”  
  
  Natalie slips her arm around mine as we walk down the sidewalk and past a long line of parking meters. She grins and glances over at me. “Fine. Then you’ll at least let me dress you from something out of my closet.”  
  
  “What’s wrong with my own wardrobe?”  
  
  She purses her lips at me and draws her chin in as if to quietly argue why I even asked a question so ridiculous. “It’s The Underground,” she says, as if there is no answer more obvious than that.  
  
  OK, she has a point. Natalie and me may be best friends, but with us it’s an opposites attract sort of thing. She’s a rocker chick who’s had a crush on Jared Leto since Fight Club. I’m more of a laid back kind of girl who rarely wears dark-colored clothes unless I’m attending a funeral. Not that Natalie wears all black and has some kind of emo hair thing going on, but she would never be caught dead in anything from my closet because she says it’s all just too plain. I beg to differ. I know how to dress, and guys—when I used to pay attention to the way they eyed my ass in my favorite jeans—have never had a problem with the clothes I choose to wear.  
  
  But The Underground was made for people like Natalie and so I guess I’ll have to endure dressing like her for one night just to fit in. I’m not a follower. I never have been. But I’ll definitely become someone I’m not for a few hours if it’ll make me blend in rather than make me a blatant eye sore and draw attention.  
  
  \~\~\~  
  
  Natalie’s bedroom is the complete opposite of OCD clean. And this is yet another way she and I are so completely different. I hang my clothes up by color. She leaves hers in the basket at the foot of her bed for weeks before throwing them all back into the laundry to be washed again because of the wrinkles. I dust my room daily. I don’t think she has ever actually dusted her room unless you call wiping off the two-inches of dust from her laptop keyboard, cleaning.  
  
  “This will look perfect on you,” Natalie says holding up a thin, half-sleeve tight white shirt with Scars on Broadway written across the front. “It fits tight and your boobs are perfect.” She puts the shirt up against my chest and examines what I might look like in it.  
  
  I snarl at her, not satisfied with her first pick.  
  
  She rolls her eyes and her shoulders slump over. “Fine,” she says, tossing the shirt on the bed. She slides her hand in the closet and takes down another one, holding it up with a big smile that is at the same time a manipulation tactic of hers. Big toothy smiles equal me not wanting to crush her efforts.  
  
  “How about something that doesn’t have some random band plastered across the front?” I say.  
  
  “It’s Brandon Boyd,” she says, her eyes bugging out at me. “How can you not like Brandon Boyd?”  
  
  “He’s alright,” I say. “I’m just not into advertising him on my chest.”  
  
  “I’d like to actually have him on my chest,” she says, admiring the tight-fitting V-neck top made much like the first one she tried to show me.  
  
  “Well then you wear it.”  
  
  She looks across at me, nodding as if contemplating the idea. “I think I will.” She takes off the top she’s already wearing and tosses it in the laundry basket next to the closet and then slips Brandon Boyd’s face down over her huge boobs.  
  
  “Looks good on you,” I say, watching her adjust herself and admiring what she sees in the mirror at several different angles.  
  
  “Damn right he does,” she says.  
  
  “How’s Jared Leto going to feel about this?” I joke.  
  
  Natalie spats out a laugh and she tosses her long dark hair back and reaches for the hairbrush. “He’ll always be my number one.”  
  
  “What about Damon, y’know, the non-imaginary boyfriend?”  
  
  “Stop it,” she says, looking at me through the reflection in the mirror. “If you keep raggin’ on me about Damon like you do—.” She stops the brush mid-way in her hair and turns at the waist to face me. “Do you have a thing for Damon, or something?”  
  
  My head springs back and I feel my eyebrows knot thickly in my forehead.  
  
  “No, Nat! What the hell?”  
  
  Natalie laughs and goes back to brushing her hair. “We’re going to find you a guy tonight. That’s what you need. It’ll fix everything.”  
  
  My silence immediately tells her that she went too far. I hate it when she does this. Why does everybody have to be with somebody? It’s a stupid delusion and a really pathetic way of thinking.  
  
  She places the brush back on the dresser and turns around fully, letting the jest disappear from her face and she sighs heavily. “I know I shouldn’t say that—look I swear I won’t pull any match-making stuff, alright?” She puts both of her hands up in surrender.  
  
  “I believe you,” I say, giving in to her sincerity. Of course, I know too that a promise never stops her completely. She may not directly try to hook me up with somebody, but all she has to do is bat those dark eyelashes of hers at Damon about any guy in the place and Damon will know right away what she wants him to do.  
  
  But I don’t need their help. I don’t want to hook up with anyone.  
  
  “Oh!” Natalie says with her head in the closet. “This top is perfect!” She turns around dangling a loose-fitting black top with the fabric in the shoulders missin  
g. Across the front it reads: SINNER.  
  
  “Got it at Hot Topic,” she says, sliding it off the hanger.  
  
  Not wanting to drag this shirt-choosing session out any longer, I slip off my own shirt and then take it from her hand.  
  
  “Black bra,” she says. “Good choice.”  
  
  I slip the top on and check myself out in the mirror.  
  
  “Yeah? Say it,” she says, coming up behind me with a big smile on her face. “You like it, dont’cha?”  
  
  I smile slimly back at her and turn to look at how the bottom of the shirt just barely covers the top of my hips.  
  
  And then I notice it says SAINT across the back.  
  
  “OK,” I say, “I do like it.” I turn around and point sternly at her. “But not enough to start raiding your closet so don’t get your hopes up. I’m content with my cute button-up tops, thank you very much.”  
  
  “I never said your clothes weren’t cute, Cam.” She grins and reaches up and snaps my bra against my back. “You look frickin’ sexy on a daily basis, girl—I’d totally do you if I wasn’t with Damon.”  
  
  My mouth falls open. “You’re so damn sick, Nat!”  
  
  “I know,” she says as I turn back to the mirror and I hear the devilish grin in her voice. “But it’s the truth. I’ve told you before and I wasn’t joking.”  
  
  I just shake my head at her, smiling while picking her brush up from the dresser. Natalie had a girlfriend once, during a short breakup with Damon. But she claimed she was ‘way too cock-crazy’ (her words, not mine) to spend her life with a girl. Natalie’s not a real slut—she’ll knock your face off if you ever call her one—but she is any boyfriend’s nympho dream, that’s for sure.  
  
  “Now let me do your makeup,” she says stepping up to the vanity with me.  
  
  “No!”  
  
  Natalie thrusts her hands on her hourglass hips and looks at me wide-eyed, as if she was my mom and I just mouthed-off to her.  
  
  “Do you want it to be painful?” she asks, glaring at me.   I give in and plop down on the vanity chair.  
  
  “Whatever,” I say, holding up my chin to give her full access to my face, which has just become her blank canvas. “Just no raccoon-eye shit, alright?”  
  
  She cups my chin vigorously in her hand. “Now hush,” she demands, barely breaking a smile and trying to look all serious. “An arteest,” she says with a dramatic accent and the flourish of her free hand, “needs quiet to vork! Vut do you think these ees, a Deetroit beautee parlor?”  
  
  By the time she’s finished with me, I look exactly like her. Except for the giant boobs and silky brown hair. My hair is the kind of blonde some girls pay a salon a lot of money to have, and it stops just to the middle of my back. I admit I was lucky in the perfect hair department. Natalie said that my hair would look better if I wore it down and so I did. I had no choice. She was very intimidating….  
  
  And she didn’t make me look like a raccoon, but she didn’t go light on the dark eye shadow, either. “Dark eyes with blonde hair,” she had said as she went about applying the thick, black mascara. “It’s sexy hot.” And apparently my little open-toed sandals just weren’t going to do, because she made me toss them and wear a pair of her pointy heeled boots, which fit snugly over the legs of my skinny jeans.  
  
  “You are one sexy bitch,” she says, looking me up and down.  
  
  “And you owe me big-time for doing this,” I say.  
  
  “Huh? I owe you?” She cocks her head to the side. “No, honey, I think not. You’ll owe me before this is over with because you’re going to have a great time and will be begging me to take you there more often.”  
  
  I sneer playfully at her with my arms crossed and my hip popped out. “I doubt that,” I say. “But I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and hope that I have a good time, at least.”  
  
  “Good,” she says, slipping on her boots. “Now let’s get out of here; Damon’s waiting for us.”  
  
  2  
  
  WE MAKE IT TO THE Underground just as night falls, but not before driving around in Damon’s souped-up truck to various houses. He would pull into the driveway, get out and stay inside no more than three or four minutes and never say a word when he came back out. At least, not about what he went inside for, or who he talked to—the usual stuff that would make these visits normal. But not much about Damon is usual or normal. I love him to death. I’ve known him almost as long as I’ve known Natalie, but I’ve never been able to accept his drug habits. He grows copious amounts of weed in his basement, but he’s not a pothead. In fact, no one but me and a few of his close friends would ever suspect that a hot piece of ass like Damon Winters would be a grower, because most growers look like white trash and often have hairdos that are stuck somewhere between the 70’s and 90’s. Damon is far from looking like white trash—he could be Alex Pettyfer’s younger brother. And Damon says weed just isn’t his thing. No, Damon’s drug of choice is cocaine and he only grows and sells weed to pay for his cocaine habit.  
  
  Natalie pretends that what Damon does is perfectly harmless. She knows that he doesn’t smoke weed and says that weed really isn’t that bad and if other people want to smoke it to chill out and relax, that she sees no harm in Damon helping with that.  
  
  She refuses to believe, however, that cocaine has seen more action from his face than any part of her body has.  
  
  “OK, you’re going to have a good time, right?” Natalie bumps my backseat door shut with her butt after I get out and then she looks hopelessly at me. “Just don’t fight it and try to enjoy yourself.”  
  
  I roll my eyes. “Nat, I wouldn’t deliberately try to hate it,” I say. “I do want to enjoy myself.”  
  
  Damon comes around to our side of the truck and slips his arms around both of our waists. “I get to go in with two hot chicks on my arms.”  
  
  Natalie elbows him with a pretend resentful smirk. “Shut up, baby. You’ll make me jealous.” Already she’s grinning impishly up at him.  
  
  Damon lets his hand drop from her waist and he grabs a handful of her butt cheek. She makes a sickening moaning sound and reaches up on her toes to kiss him. I want to tell them to get a room, but I’d be wasting my breath.  
  
  The Underground is the hottest spot just outside of downtown North Carolina, but you won’t find it listed in the phone book. Only people like us know it exists. Some guy named Rob rented out an abandoned warehouse two years ago and spent about one million of his rich daddy’s money to convert it into a secret nightclub. Two years and going strong; the place has since become a spot where local rock sex gods can live the rock n’ roll dream with screaming fans and groupies. But it’s not a trashy joint. From the outside it might look like an abandoned building in a partial ghost town, but the inside is like any upscale hard rock night club equipped with colorful strobe lights that shoot continuously across the space, slutty-looking waitresses and a stage big enough for two bands to play at the same time.  
  
  To keep The Underground private, everybody who goes has to park elsewhere in the city and walk to it because a street lined with vehicles outside an ‘abandoned’ warehouse is a dead giveaway.  
  
  We park in the back of a nearby Mickey D’s and walk about ten minutes through spooky town.  
  
  Natalie moves from Damon’s right side and gets in between us, but it’s just so she can torture me before we go inside.  
  
  “OK,” she says as if about to run down a list of do’s and don’t’s for me, “If anybody asks, you’re single, alright?” She waves her hand at me. “None of that stuff you pulled like with that guy who was hitting on you at Office Depot.”  
  
  “What was she doing at Office Depot?” Damon says, laughing.  
  
  “Damon, this guy was on her,” Natalie says, totally ignoring the fact that I’m right here, “I mean like all she had to do was bat her eyes once and he would’ve bought her a car—you know what she said to him?”  
  
  I roll my eyes and pull my arm out of hers. “Nat, you’re so stupid. It wasn’t like that.”  
  
  “Yeah, babe,” Damon says. “If the guy works at Office Depot he’s not going to be buying anybody any cars.”  
  
  Natalie smacks him across the shoulder playfully. “I didn’t say he worked there—anyway, the guy looked like the lovechild of…Adam Levine and…,” she twirls her fingers around above her head to let another famous example materialize on her tongue, “…Jensen Ackles, and Miss Prudeness here told him she was a lesbian when he asked for her number.”  
  
  “Oh shut up, Nat!” I say, irritated at her serious over-exaggeration illness. “He did not look like either one of those guys. He was just a regular guy who didn’t happen to be fugly.”  
  
  She waves me away and turns back to Damon. “Whatever. The point is that she’ll lie to keep them away. I don’t doubt for a second that she’d go as far as to tell a guy she has Chlamydia and an out of control case of crabs.”  
  
  Damon laughs.  
  
  I stop on the dark sidewalk and cross my arms over my chest, chewing on the inside of my bottom lip in agitation.  
  
  Natalie, realizing I’m not walking beside her anymore runs back towards me. “OK! OK! Look, I just don’t want you to ruin it for yourself, that’s all. I’m just asking that if someone—who isn’t a total hunchback—hits on you that you not immediately push him away. Nothing wrong with talking and getting to know one another. I’m not asking you to go home with him.”  
  
  I’m already hating her for this. She swore!  
  
  Damon comes up behind her and wraps his hands around her waist, nuzzling his mouth into her squirming neck.  
  
  “Maybe you should just let her do what she wants, babe. Stop being so pushy.”  
  
  “Thank you, Damon,” I say with a quick nod.  
  
  He winks at me.  
  
  Natalie purses her lips and says, “You’re right,” and then puts up her hands, “I won’t say anything else. I swear.”  
  
  Yeah, I have heard that before….  
  
  “Good,” I say and we all start walking again. Already these boots are killing my feet.  
  
  The ogre at the warehouse entrance inspects  
us at the door with his huge arms crossed in front.  
  
  He holds out his hand.  
  
  Natalie’s face twists into an offended knot. “What? Is Rob charging now?”  
  
  Damon reaches into his back pocket and pulls out his wallet, fingering the bills inside.  
  
  “Twenty bucks a pop,” the ogre says with a grunt.  
  
  “Twenty? Are you fucking kidding me?!” Natalie shrieks.  
  
  Damon gently pushes her aside and slaps three twenty dollar bills into the ogre’s hand. The ogre shoves the money into his pocket and moves to let us pass. I go first and Damon puts his hand on Natalie’s lower back to guide her in front of him.  
  
  She sneers at the ogre as she passes by. “Probably going to keep it for himself,” she says. “I’m going to ask Rob about this.”  
  
  “Come on,” Damon says and we slip past the door and down one lengthy, dreary hallway with a single flickering florescent light until we make it to the industrial elevator at the end.  
  
  The metal jolts as the cage door closes and we’re rather noisily riding to the basement floor many feet below. It’s just one floor down, but the elevator rattles so much I feel like it’s going to snap any second and send us plunging to our deaths. Loud, booming drums and the shouting of drunk college students and probably a lot of drop-outs funnels through the basement floor and into the cage elevator, louder every inch we descend into the bowels of The Underground. The elevator rumbles to a halt and another ogre opens the cage door to let us out.  
  
  Natalie stumbles into me from behind. “Hurry up!” she says, pushing me playfully in the back. “I think that’s Four Collision playing!” Her voice rises over the music as we make our way into the main room.  
  
  Natalie takes Damon by the hand and then tries to grab mine, but I know what she has in store and I’m not going into a throng of bouncing, sweaty bodies wearing these stupid boots.  
  
  “Oh, come on!” she urges, practically begging. Then an aggravated line deepens around her snarling nose and she thrusts my hand into hers and pulls me towards her. “Stop being a baby! If anybody knocks you over, I’ll personally kick their ass, alright?”  
  
  Damon is grinning at me from the side.  
  
  “Fine!” I say and head out with them, Natalie practically pulling my fingers out of the sockets.  
  
  We hit the dance floor and after a while of Natalie doing what any best friend would do by grinding against me to make me feel included, she eases her way into Damon’s world only. She might as well be having sex with him right there in front of everybody, but no one notices. I only notice because I’m probably the only girl in the entire place without a date doing the same thing. I take advantage of the opportunity and slip my way off the dance floor and head to the bar.  
  
  “What can I get’cha?” the tall blond guy behind the bar says as I push myself up on my toes and take an empty barstool.  
  
  “Rum & Coke.”  
  
  He goes to make my drink. “Hard stuff, huh?” he says, filling the glass with ice. “Going to show me your I.D.?” He grins.  
  
  I purse my lips at him. “Yeah, I’ll show you my I.D. when you show me your liquor license.” I grin right back at him and he smiles.  
  
  He finishes mixing the drink and slides it over to me.  
  
  “I don’t really drink much anyway,” I say, taking a little sip from the straw.  
  
  “Much?”  
  
  “Yeah, well, tonight I think I’ll need a buzz.” I set the glass down and finger the lime on the rim.  
  
  “Why’s that?” he asks, wiping the bar top down with a paper towel.  
  
  “Wait a second,” I hold up one finger, “before you get the wrong idea, I’m not here to spill my guts to you—bartender-customer therapy.” Natalie is all the therapy I can handle.  
  
  He laughs and tosses the paper towel somewhere behind the bar.  
  
  “Well that’s good to know because I’m not the advice type.”  
  
  I take another small sip, leaning over this time instead of lifting the glass from the bar; my loose hair falls all around my face. I rise back up and tuck one side behind my ear. I really hate wearing my hair down; it’s more trouble than it’s worth.  
  
  “Well, if you must know,” I say looking right at him, “I was dragged here by my relentless best friend who would probably do something embarrassing to me in my sleep and take a blackmail pic if I didn’t come.”  
  
  “Ah, one of those,” he says, laying his arms across the bar top and folding his hands together. “I had a friend like that once. Six months after my fiancé skipped out on me, he dragged me to a nightclub just outside of Baltimore—I just wanted to sit at home and sulk in my misery, but turns out that night out was exactly what I needed.”  
  
  Oh great, this guy thinks he knows me already, or, at least my ‘situation’. But he doesn’t know anything about my situation. Maybe he has the bad ex thing down—because we all have that eventually—but the rest of it, my parents’ divorce, my older brother, Cole, going to jail, the death of the love of my life…I’m not about to tell this guy anything. The moment you tell someone else is the moment you become a whiner and the world’s smallest violin starts to play. The truth is, we all have problems; we all go through hardships and pain, and my pain is paradise compared to a lot of people’s and I really have no right to whine at all.  
  
  “I thought you weren’t the advice type?” I smile sweetly.  
  
  He leans away from the bar and says, “I’m not, but if you’re getting something out of my story then be grateful.”  
  
  I smirk and take a fake sip this time. I don’t really want a buzz and I definitely don’t want to get drunk, especially since I have a feeling I’m going to be the one driving us home again.  
  
  Trying to take the spotlight off me, I prop one elbow on the bar and rest my chin on my knuckles and say, “So then what happened that night?”  
  
  The left side of his mouth lifts into a grin and he says, shaking his blond head, “I got laid for the first time since she left me and I remembered how good it felt to be unchained from one person.”  
  
  I didn’t expect that kind of answer. Most guys I know would’ve lied about their relationship phobia, especially if they were hitting on me. I kind of like this guy. Just as a guy, of course; I’m not about to, as Natalie might say, bend over for him.  
  
  “I see,” I say, trying to hold in the true measure of my smile. “Well, at least you’re honest.”  
  
  “No other way to be,” he says as he reaches for an empty glass and starts to make a Rum & Coke for himself. “I’ve found that most girls are as much afraid of commitment as guys are these days and if you’re up front in the beginning, you’re more likely to come out of the one-nighter unscathed.”  
  
  I nod, fitting my fingertips around my straw. There’s no way I’d openly admit it to him, but I completely agree with him and even find it refreshing. I’ve never really given it that much thought before, but as much as I don’t want a relationship within one hundred feet of me, I am still human and I wouldn’t mind a one-night stand.  
  
  Just not with him. Or anyone in this place. OK, so maybe I’m too chicken for a one-night stand and this drink has already started going straight to my head. Truth is, I’ve never done anything like that before and even though the thought is kind of exciting, it still scares the shit out of me. I’ve only ever been with two guys: Ian Walsh, my first love who took my virginity and died in a car accident three months later, and then Christian Deering, my Ian rebound guy and the jerk who cheated on me with some red-haired slut.  
  
  I’m just glad I never said that poisonous three-word phrase that begins with ‘I’ and ends with ‘you’, back to him because I had a feeling, deep down, that when he said it to me, he didn’t know what the hell he was talking about.  
  
  Then again, maybe he did and that’s why after five months of dating, he hooked up with someone else: because I never said it back.  
  
  I look up at the bartender to notice he’s smiling back at me, waiting patiently for me to say something. This guy’s good; either that, or he really is just trying to be friendly. I admit, he  
’s cute; can’t be older than twenty-five and has soft brown eyes that smile before his lips do. I notice how toned his biceps and chest are underneath that tight-fitting t-shirt. And he’s tanned; definitely a guy who has lived most of his life near an ocean somewhere.  
  
  I stop looking when I notice my mind wandering, thinking about how he looks in swim shorts and no shirt.  
  
  “I’m Blake,” he says. “I’m Rob’s brother.”  
  
  Rob? Oh yeah, the guy who owns The Underground.  
  
  I reach out my hand and Blake gently shakes it.  
  
  “Camryn.”  
  
  I hear Natalie’s voice over the music before I even see her. She makes her way through a cluster of people standing around near the dance floor and pushes her way past to get to me. Immediately, she takes note of Blake and her eyes start glistening, lighting up with her huge, blatant smile. Damon, following behind her with her hand still clasped in his, notices, too, but he just locks emotionless eyes with me. I get the strangest feeling from it, but I brush it off as Natalie presses her shoulder into mine.  
  
  “What are you doing over here?” she asks with obvious accusation in her voice. She’s grinning from ear to ear and glances between Blake and me several times before giving me all of her attention.  
  
  “Having a drink,” I say. “Did you come over here to get one for yourself, or to check up on me?”  
  
  “Both!” she says, letting Damon’s hand fall away from hers and she reaches up and taps hers fingers on the bar, smiling at Blake. “Anything with Vodka.”  
  
  Blake nods and looks at Damon.  
  
  “I’ll have Rum & Coke,” Damon says.  
  
  Natalie presses her lips against the side of my head and I feel the heat of her breath on my ear when she whispers, “Holy shit, Cam! Do you know who that is?”  
  
  I notice Blake’s mouth spread subtly into a smile, having heard her.  
  
  Feeling my face get hot with embarrassment, I whisper back, “Yeah, his name is Blake.”  
  
  “That’s Rob’s brother!” she hisses; her gaze falls back on him.  
  
  I look up at Damon, hoping he’ll get the hint and drag her off somewhere, but this time he pretends not to ‘get it’. Where is the Damon I know, the one who used to have my back when it came to Natalie?",1,1756410569.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

My friend and I are working on a new project and we’d love to get input from business owners or managers. We’re thinking of building an AI-powered “store manager assistant” that helps with the day-to-day tasks that often eat up time, such as:

* Staff scheduling and shift planning
* Employee communication
* Payroll management
* Ordering supplies / inventory restock
* Social media posting & engagement
* Sales & performance reporting

We are curious if real business owners  really need something like this. If you are near LA and would like to chat a bit about this, I would be happy to buy you a coffee as a thank-you!

Thanks so much!",1,1756410561.0,smallbusiness,2,1.0,False

I have my first ultrasound with my OB scheduled one week from today. I went to a private ultrasound at 5+5 (I thought I was 6) where I saw a sac and yolk but no fetal pole. From what I understand that’s normal but it still made me a anxious. 

Now I’m 8 weeks and my symptoms have disappeared. I never felt any nausea, but over the past few weeks I was ravenous, hated coffee, moody, bone tired all day, breaking out around my chin and had insane bloat. I had moderate cramping the first few weeks that has definitely subsided. Overall my symptoms have been present but mild. 

Today I am completely fine - I actually feel the best I have in weeks. The only thing I’m noticing today is I still don’t want to drink coffee. My oura is even giving me high readiness scores! 

Should I be worried given the results of my last scan? Or is this the normal course of the first trimester?",1,1756410560.0,pregnant,9,1.0,False

  He’d chosen it for the atmosphere. Ryan was certain of it the moment she saw the house on the cliff. It was stone gray and solitary. It turned its back on the Pacific. It wasn’t a symmetrical structure, but rambling, with sections of varying heights rising up here and there, giving it a wild sort of grace. High at the top of a winding cliff road, with the backdrop of an angry sky, the house was both magnificent and eerie.  
  
  Like something out of an old movie, Ryan decided as she shifted into first to take the climb. She had heard Pierce Atkins was eccentric. The house seemed to testify to that.  
  
  All it needs, she mused, is a thunderclap, a little fog and the howl of a wolf; just some minor special effects. Amused at the thought, she drew the car to a stop and looked the house over again. You wouldn’t see many like it only a hundred and fifty miles north of L.A. You wouldn’t, she corrected silently, see many like it anywhere.  
  
  The moment she slid from the car, the wind pulled at her, whipping her hair around her face and tugging at her skirt. She was tempted to go to the seawall and take a look at the ocean but hurried up the steps instead. She hadn’t come to admire the view.  
  
  The knocker was old and heavy. It gave a very impressive thud when she pounded it against the door. Ryan told herself she wasn’t the least bit nervous but switched her briefcase from hand to hand as she waited. Her father would be furious if she walked away without Pierce Atkins’s signature on the contracts she carried. No, not furious, she amended. Silent. No one could use silence more effectively than Bennett Swan.  
  
  I’m not going to walk away empty-handed, she assured herself. I know how to handle temperamental entertainers. I’ve spent years watching how it’s done and—  
  
  Her thoughts were cut off as the door opened. Ryan stared. Staring back at her was the largest man she had ever seen. He was at least six foot five, with shoulders that all but filled the doorway. And his face. Ryan decided he was, indisputably, the ugliest human being she had ever seen. His broad face was pale. His nose had obviously been broken and had reknit at an odd angle. His eyes were small, a washed-out brown that matched his thick mat of hair. Atmosphere, Ryan thought again. Atkins must have chosen him for atmosphere.  
  
  “Good afternoon,” she managed. “Ryan Swan. Mr. Atkins is expecting me.”  
  
  “Miss Swan.” The slow, barrel-deep voice suited him perfectly. When the man stepped back, Ryan found herself fighting a reluctance to enter. Storm clouds, a hulking butler and a brooding house on a cliff. Oh, yes, she decided. Atkins knows how to set the stage.  
  
  She walked in. As the door closed behind her, Ryan took a quick glimpse around.  
  
  “Wait here,” the laconic butler instructed and walked, lightly for a big man, down the hall.  
  
  “Of course, thank you very much,” she muttered to his back.  
  
  The walls were white and draped with tapestries. The one nearest her was a faded medieval scene depicting the young Arthur drawing the sword from the stone, with Merlin the Enchanter highlighted in the background. Ryan nodded. It was an exquisite piece of work and suited to a man like Atkins. Turning, she found herself staring at her own reflection in an ornate cheval glass.  
  
  It annoyed her to see that her hair was mussed. She represented Swan Productions. Ryan pushed at the stray misty blond wisps. The green of her eyes had darkened with a mixture of anxiety and excitement. Her cheeks were flushed with it. Taking a deep breath, she ordered herself to calm down. She straightened her jacket.  
  
  Hearing footsteps, she quickly turned away from the mirror. She didn’t want to be caught studying herself or attempting last-minute repairs. It was the butler again, alone. Ryan repressed a surge of annoyance.  
  
  “He’ll see you downstairs.”  
  
  “Oh.” Ryan opened her mouth to say something else, but he was already retreating. She had to scramble to keep up.  
  
  The hall wound to the right. Ryan’s heels clicked quickly as she trotted to match the butler’s pace. Then he stopped so abruptly, she nearly collided with his back.  
  
  “Down there.” He had opened a door and was already walking away.  
  
  “But . . .” Ryan scowled after him, then made her way down the dimly lighted steps. Really, this was ridiculous, she thought. A business meeting should be conducted in an office, or at least in a suitable restaurant. Show business, she mused scornfully.  
  
  The sound of her own footfalls echoed back at her. There was no sound at all from the room below. Oh, yes, she concluded, Atkins knows how to set the stage. She was beginning to dislike him intensely. Her heart was hammering uncomfortably as she rounded the last curve in the winding staircase.  
  
  The lower floor was huge, a sprawling room with crates and trunks and paraphernalia stacked all around. The walls were paneled and the floor was tiled, but no one had bothered with any further decoration. Ryan looked around, frowning, as she walked down the last of the steps.  
  
  He watched her. He had the talent for absolute stillness, absolute concentration. It was essential to his craft. He also had the ability to sum up a person quickly. That, too, was part of his profession. She was younger than he had expected, a fragile-looking woman, small in stature, slight in build, with clouds of pale hair and a delicately molded face. A strong chin.  
  
  She was annoyed, he noted, and not a little apprehensive. A smile tugged at his mouth. Even after she began to wander around the room, he made no move to go to her. Very businesslike, he thought, with her trim, tailored suit, sensible shoes, expensive briefcase and very feminine hands. Interesting.  
  
  “Miss Swan.”  
  
  Ryan jolted, then swore at herself. Turning in the direction of the voice, she saw only shadows.  
  
  “You’re very prompt.”  
  
  He moved then, and Ryan saw that he stood on a small stage. He wore black and blended with the shadows. With an effort, she kept the annoyance from her voice. “Mr. Atkins.” Ryan went toward him then, fixing on a trained smile. “You have quite a house.”  
  
  “Thank you.”  
  
  He didn’t come down to her but stood on the stage. Ryan was forced to look up at him. It surprised her that he was more dramatic in person than on tape. Normally, she had found the reverse to be true. She had seen his performances. Indeed, since her father had taken ill and reluctantly turned Atkins over to her, Ryan had spent two entire evenings watching every available tape on Pierce Atkins.  
  
  Dramatic, she decided, noting a raw-boned face with a thick, waving mane of black hair. There was a small scar along his jawline, and his mouth was long and thin. His brows were arched with a slight upsweep at the tips. But it was the eyes under them which held her. She had never seen eyes so dark, so deep. Were they gray? Were they black? Yet it wasn’t their color that disconcerted her, it was the absolute concentration in them. She felt her throat go dry and swallowed in defense. She could almost believe he was reading her mind.  
  
  He had been called the greatest magician of the decade, some said the greatest of the last half of the century. His illusions and escapes were daring, flashy and unexplainable. It was a common thing to hear of him referred to as a wizard. Staring into his eyes, Ryan began to understand why.  
  
  She shook herself free of the trance and started again. She didn’t believe in magic. “Mr. Atkins, my father apologizes for not being able to come himself. I hope—”  
  
  “He’s feeling better.”  
  
  Confused, she stopped. “Yes. Yes, he is.” She found herself staring again.  
  
  Pierce smiled as he stepped down to her. “He phoned an hour ago, Miss Swan. Long-distance dialing, no telepathy.” Ryan glared before she could stop herself, but his smile only widened. “Did you have a nice drive?”  
  
  “Yes, thank you.”  
  
  “But a long one,” he said. “Sit.” Pierce gestured to a table, then took a chair behind it. Rya  
n sat opposite him.  
  
  “Mr. Atkins,” she began, feeling more at ease now that business was about to begin. “I know my father has discussed Swan Productions’ offer with you and your representative at length, but perhaps you’d like to go over the details again.” She set her briefcase on the table. “I could clarify any questions you might have.”  
  
  “Have you worked for Swan Productions long, Miss Swan?”  
  
  The question interrupted the flow of her presentation, but Ryan shifted her thoughts. Entertainers often had to be humored. “Five years, Mr. Atkins. I assure you, I’m qualified to answer your questions and negotiate terms if necessary.”  
  
  Her voice was very smooth, but she was nervous. Pierce saw it in the careful way she folded her hands on the table. “I’m sure you’re qualified, Miss Swan,” he agreed. “Your father isn’t an easy man to please.”  
  
  Surprise and a trace of apprehension flickered into her eyes. “No,” she said calmly, “which is why you can be sure of receiving the best promotion, the best production staff, the best contract available. Three one-hour television specials over three years, guaranteed prime time, with a budget that ensures quality.” She paused only for a moment. “An advantageous arrangement for you and for Swan Productions.”  
  
  “Perhaps.”  
  
  He was looking at her too closely. Ryan forced herself not to fidget. Gray, she saw. His eyes were gray—as dark as was possible without being black.  
  
  “Of course,” she continued, “your career has been aimed primarily at live audiences in clubs and theaters. Vegas, Tahoe, the London Palladium and so forth.”  
  
  “An illusion means nothing on film, Miss Swan. Film can be altered.”  
  
  “Yes, I realize that. To have any impact, a trick has to be performed live.”  
  
  “Illusion,” Pierce corrected. “I don’t do tricks.”  
  
  Ryan stopped. His eyes were steady on hers. “Illusion,” she amended with a nod. “The specials would be broadcasted live, with a studio audience as well. The publicity—”  
  
  “You don’t believe in magic, do you, Miss Swan?” There was the slightest of smiles on his mouth, the barest trace of amusement in his voice.  
  
  “Mr. Atkins, you’re a very talented man,” she said carefully. “I admire your work.”  
  
  “A diplomat,” he concluded, leaning back. “And a cynic. I like that.”  
  
  Ryan didn’t feel complimented. He was laughing at her without making the smallest attempt to conceal it. Your job, she reminded herself as her teeth clenched. Do your job. “Mr. Atkins, if we could discuss the terms of the contract—”  
  
  “I don’t do business with anyone until I know who they are.”  
  
  Ryan let out a quick breath. “My father—”  
  
  “I’m not talking to your father,” Pierce interrupted smoothly.  
  
  “I didn’t think to type up a bio,” she snapped, then bit her tongue. Damn! She couldn’t afford to lose her temper. But Pierce grinned, pleased.  
  
  “I don’t think that will be necessary.” He had her hand in his before she realized what he was doing.  
  
  “Nevermore.”  
  
  The voice from behind had Ryan jolting in her chair.  
  
  “That’s just Merlin,” Pierce said mildly as she twisted her head.  
  
  There was a large black myna bird in a cage to her right. Ryan took a deep breath and tried to steady her nerves. The bird was staring at her.  
  
  “Very clever,” she managed, eyeing the bird with some reservation. “Did you teach him to talk?”  
  
  “Mmm.”  
  
  “Buy you a drink, sweetie?”  
  
  Wide-eyed, Ryan gave a muffled laugh as she turned back to Pierce. He merely gave the bird a careless glance. “I haven’t taught him manners.”  
  
  She struggled not to be amused. “Mr. Atkins, if we could—”  
  
  “Your father wanted a son.” Ryan forgot what she had been about to say and stared at him. “That made it difficult for you.” Pierce was looking into her eyes again, her hand held loosely in his. “You’re not married, you live alone. You’re a realist who considers herself very practical. You find it difficult to control your temper, but you work at it. You’re a very cautious woman, Miss Swan, slow to trust, careful in relationships. You’re impatient because you have something to prove—to yourself and to your father.”  
  
  His eyes lost their intense directness when he smiled at her. “A parlor game, Miss Swan, or telepathy?” When Pierce released her hand, Ryan pulled it from the table into her lap. She hadn’t cared for his accuracy.  
  
  “A little amateur psychology,” he said comfortably, enjoying her stunned expression. “A basic knowledge of Bennett Swan and an understanding of body language.” He shrugged his shoulders. “No trick, Miss Swan, just educated guesswork. How close was I?”  
  
  Ryan gripped her hands together in her lap. Her right palm was still warm from his. “I didn’t come here to play games, Mr. Atkins.”  
  
  “No.” He smiled again, charmingly. “You came to close a deal, but I do things in my own time, in my own way. My profession encourages eccentricity, Miss Swan. Humor me.”  
  
  “I’m doing my best,” Ryan returned, then took a deep breath and sat back. “I think it’s safe to say that we’re both very serious about our professions.”  
  
  “Agreed.”  
  
  “Then you understand that it’s my job to sign you with Swan, Mr. Atkins.” Perhaps a bit of flattery would work, she decided. “We want you because you’re the best in your field.”  
  
  “I’m aware of that,” he answered without batting an eye.  
  
  “Aware that we want you or that you’re the best?” she found herself demanding.  
  
  He flashed her a very appealing grin. “Of both.”  
  
  Ryan took a deep breath and reminded herself that entertainers were often impossible. “Mr. Atkins,” she began.  
  
  With a flutter of wings, Merlin swooped out of his cage and landed on her shoulder. Ryan gasped and froze.  
  
  “Oh, God,” she murmured. This was too much, she thought numbly. Entirely too much.  
  
  Pierce frowned at the bird as it settled its wings. “Odd, he’s never done that with anyone before.”  
  
  “Aren’t I lucky,” Ryan muttered, sitting perfectly still. Did birds bite? she wondered. She decided she didn’t care to wait to find out. “Do you think you could—ah, persuade him to perch somewhere else?”  
  
  A slight gesture of Pierce’s hand had Merlin leaving Ryan’s shoulder to land on his own.  
  
  “Mr. Atkins, please, I realize a man in your profession would have a taste for—atmosphere.” Ryan took a breath to steady herself, but it didn’t work. “It’s very difficult to discuss business in—in a dungeon,” she said with a sweep of her arm. “With a crazed raven swooping down on me and . . .”  
  
  Pierce’s shout of laughter cut her off. On his shoulder the bird settled his wings and stared, steely-eyed, at Ryan. “Ryan Swan, I’m going to like you. I work in this dungeon,” he explained good-naturedly. “It’s private and quiet. Illusions take more than skill; they take a great deal of planning and preparation.”  
  
  “I understand that, Mr. Atkins, but—”  
  
  “We’ll discuss business more conventionally over dinner,” he interrupted.  
  
  Ryan rose as he did. She hadn’t planned to stay more than an hour or two. It was a good thirty-minute drive down the cliff road to her hotel.  
  
  “You’ll stay the night,” Pierce added, as if he had indeed read her thoughts.  
  
  “I appreciate your hospitality, Mr. Atkins,” she began, following as he walked back to the stairs, the bird remaining placidly on his shoulder. “But I have a reservation at a hotel in town. Tomorrow—”  
  
  “Do you have your bags?” Pierce stopped to take her arm before he mounted the steps.  
  
  “Yes, in the car, but—”  
  
  “Link will cancel your reservation, Miss Swan. We’re in for a storm.” He turned his head to glance at her. “I wouldn’t like to think of you driving these roads tonight.”  
  
  As if to accentuate his words, a blast of thunder greeted them as t  
hey came to the top of the stairs. Ryan murmured something. She wasn’t certain she wanted to think of spending the night in this house.  
  
  “Nothing up my sleeve,” Merlin announced.  
  
  She shot him a dubious look.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  Dinner did much to put Ryan’s mind at rest. The dining room was huge, with a roaring fire at one end and a collection of antique pewter at the other. The long refectory table was set with Sévres china and Georgian silver.  
  
  “Link’s an excellent cook,” Pierce told her as the big man set a Cornish hen in front of her. Ryan caught a glimpse of his huge  hands before Link left the room. Cautiously, she picked up her fork.  
  
  “He’s certainly quiet.”  
  
  Pierce smiled and poured a pale gold wine into her glass. “Link only talks when he has something to say. Tell me, Miss Swan, do you enjoy living in Los Angeles?”  
  
  Ryan looked over at him. His eyes were friendly now, not intense and intrusive, as they had been before. She allowed herself to relax. “Yes, I suppose I do. It’s convenient for my work.”  
  
  “Crowded?” Pierce cut into the poultry.  
  
  “Yes, of course, but I’m used to it.”  
  
  “You’ve always lived in L.A.?”  
  
  “Except when I was in school.”  
  
  Pierce noted the slight change in tone, the faintest hint of resentment no one else might have caught. He went on eating. “Where did you go to school?”  
  
  “Switzerland.”  
  
  “A beautiful country.” He reached for his wine. And she didn’t care to be shipped off, he thought. “Then you began to work for Swan Productions?”  
  
  Frowning, Ryan stared into the fire. “When my father realized I was determined, he agreed.”  
  
  “And you’re a very determined woman,” Pierce commented.  
  
  “Yes,” she admitted. “For the first year, I shuffled papers, went for coffee, and was kept away from the talent.” The frown vanished. A gleam of humor lit her eyes. “One day some papers came across my desk, quite by mistake. My father was trying to sign Mildred Chase for a miniseries. She wasn’t cooperating. I did a little research and went to see her.” Laughing with the memory, she sent Pierce a grin. “That was quite an experience. She lives in this fabulous place in the hills—guards, a dozen dogs. She’s very ‘old Hollywood.’ I think she let me in out of curiosity.”  
  
  “What did you think of her?” he asked, mainly to keep her talking, to keep her smiling.  
  
  “I thought she was wonderful. A genuine grande dame. If my knees hadn’t been shaking, I’m sure I would have curtsied.” A light of triumph covered her face. “And when I left two hours later, her signature was on the contract.”  
  
  “How did your father react?”  
  
  “He was furious.” Ryan picked up her wine. The fire sent a play of shadow and light over her skin. She was to think of the conversation later and wonder at her own expansiveness. “He raged at me for the better part of an hour.” She drank, then set down the glass. “The next day, I had a promotion and a new office. Bennett Swan appreciates people who get things done.”  
  
  “And do you,” Pierce murmured, “get things done, Miss Swan?”  
  
  “Usually,” she returned evenly. “I’m good at handling details.”  
  
  “And people?”  
  
  Ryan hesitated. His eyes were direct again. “Most people.”  
  
  He smiled, but his look remained direct. “How’s your dinner?”  
  
  “My . . .” Ryan shook her head to break the gaze, then glanced down at her plate. She was surprised to see she had eaten a healthy portion of the hen. “It’s very good. Your . . .” She looked back at him again, not certain what to call Link. Servant? Slave?  
  
  “Friend,” Pierce put in mildly and sipped his wine.  
  
  Ryan struggled against the uncomfortable feeling that he saw inside her brain. “Your friend is a marvelous cook.”  
  
  “Appearances are often deceiving,” Pierce pointed out, amused. “We’re both in professions that show an audience something that isn’t real. Swan Productions deals in illusions. So do I.” He reached toward her, and Ryan sat back quickly. In his hand was a long-stemmed red rose.  
  
  “Oh!” Surprised and pleased, Ryan took it from him. Its scent was strong and sweet. “I suppose that’s the sort of thing you have to expect when you have dinner with a magician,” she commented and smiled at him over the tip of the bud.  
  
  “Beautiful women and flowers belong together.” The wariness that came into her eyes intrigued him. A very cautious woman, he thought again. He liked caution, respected it. He also enjoyed watching people react. “You’re a beautiful woman, Ryan Swan.”  
  
  “Thank you.”  
  
  Her answer was close to prim and had his mouth twitching. “More wine?”  
  
  “No. No, thank you, I’m fine.” But her pulse was throbbing lightly. Setting the flower beside her plate, she went back to her meal. “I’ve rarely been this far up the coast,” she said conversationally. “Have you lived here long, Mr. Atkins?”  
  
  “A few years.” He swirled the wine in his glass, but she noted he drank very little. “I don’t like crowds,” he told her.  
  
  “Except at a performance,” she said with a smile.  
  
  “Naturally.”  
  
  It occurred to Ryan, when Pierce rose and suggested they sit in the parlor, that they hadn’t discussed the contract. She was going to have to steer him back to the subject.  
  
  “Mr. Atkins . . .” she began as they entered. “Oh! What a beautiful room!”  
  
  It was like stepping back to the eighteenth century. But there were no cobwebs, no signs of age. The furniture shone, and the flowers were fresh. A small upright piano stood in a corner with sheet music open. There were small, blown-glass figurines on the mantel. A menagerie, she noted on close study—unicorns, winged horses, centaurs, a three-headed hound. No conventional animals in Pierce Atkins’s collection. Yet the fire in the grate was sedate, and the lamp standing on a piecrust table was certainly a Tiffany. It was a room Ryan would have expected to find in a cozy English country house.  
  
  “I’m glad you like it,” Pierce said, standing beside her. “You seemed surprised.”  
  
  “Yes. The outside looks like a prop from a 1945 horror movie, but . . .” Ryan stopped herself, horrified. “Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean . . .” But he was grinning, obviously delighted with her observation.  
  
  “It was used for just that more than once. That’s why I bought it.”  
  
  Ryan relaxed again as she wandered around the room. “It did occur to me that you might have chosen it for the atmosphere.”  
  
  Pierce lifted a brow. “I have an—affection for things others take at face value.” He stepped to a table where cups were already laid out. “I can’t offer you coffee, I’m afraid. I don’t use caffeine. The tea is herbal and very good.” He was already pouring as Ryan stepped up to the piano.  
  
  “Tea’s fine,” she said absently. It wasn’t printed sheet music on the piano, she noted, but staff paper. Automatically, she began to pick out the handwritten notes. The melody was hauntingly romantic. “This is beautiful.” Ryan turned back to him. “Just beautiful. I didn’t know you wrote music.”  
  
  “I don’t.” Pierce set down the teapot. “Link does.” He watched Ryan’s eyes widen in astonishment. “Face value, Miss Swan?”  
  
  She lowered her eyes to her hands. “You make me quite ashamed.”  
  
  “I’ve no intention of doing that.” Crossing to her, Pierce took her hand again. “Most of us are drawn to beauty.”  
  
  “But you’re not?”  
  
  “I find surface beauty appealing, Miss Swan.” Quickly, thoroughly, he scanned her face. “Then I look for more.”  
  
  Something in the contact made her feel odd. Her voice wasn’t as strong as it should have been. “And if you don’t find it?”  
  
  “Then I discard it,” he said simply. “Come, your tea will get cold.”  
  
  “Mr. Atkins.” Ryan allowed him to lead her to a chair. “I don’t want to offend you. I can’t afford to offend you, but . . .” She let out a frustrated breath as she sat. “I think you’re a very strange man.”  
  
  He smiled. She found it compelling, the way his eyes smiled a split second before his mouth. “You’d offend me, Miss Swan, if you didn’t think so. I have no wish to be ordinary.”  
  
  He was beginning to fascinate her. Ryan had always been careful to keep her professional objectivity when dealing with talent. It was important not to be awed. If you were awed, you’d find yourself adding clauses to contracts and making rash promises.  
  
  “Mr. Atkins, about our proposition.”  
  
  “I’ve given it a great  
deal of thought.” A crash of thunder shook the windows. Ryan glanced over as he lifted his cup. “The roads will be treacherous tonight.” His eyes came back to Ryan’s. Her hands had balled into fists at the blast. “Do storms upset you, Miss Swan?”  
  
  “No, not really.” Carefully, she relaxed her fingers. “But I’m grateful for your hospitality. I don’t like to drive in them.” Lifting her cup, she tried to ignore the slashes of lightning. “If you have any questions about the terms, I’d be glad to go over them with you.”  
  
  “I think it’s clear enough.” He sipped his tea. “My agent is anxious for me to accept the contract.”  
  
  “Oh?” Ryan had to struggle to keep the triumph from her voice. It would be a mistake to push too soon.  
  
  “I never commit myself to anything until I’m certain it suits me. I’ll tell you what I’ve decided tomorrow.”  
  
  She nodded, accepting. He wasn’t playing games, and she sensed that no agent, or anyone, would influence him beyond a certain point. He was his own man, first and last.  
  
  “Do you play chess, Miss Swan?”  
  
  “What?” Distracted, she looked up again. “I beg your pardon?”  
  
  “Do you play chess?” he repeated.  
  
  “Why, yes, I do.”  
  
  “I thought so. You know when to move and when to wait. Would you like to play?”  
  
  “Yes,” she agreed without hesitation. “I would.”  
  
  Rising, he offered his hand and led her to a table by the windows. Outside, the rain hurled itself against the glass. But when she saw the chessboard already set up, she forgot the storm.  
  
  “They’re exquisite!” Ryan lifted the white king. It was oversized and carved in marble. “Arthur,” she said, then picked up the queen. “And Guinevere.” She studied the other pieces. “Lancelot the knight, Merlin the bishop, and, of course, Camelot.” She turned the castle over in her palm. “I’ve never seen anything like these.”  
  
  “Take the white,” he invited, seating himself behind the black. “Do you play to win, Miss Swan?”  
  
  She took the chair opposite him. “Yes, doesn’t everyone?”  
  
  He gave her a long, unfathomable look. “No. Some play for the game.”  
  
  After ten minutes Ryan no longer heard the rain on the windows. Pierce was a shrewd player and a silent one. She found herself watching his hands as they slid pieces over the board. They were long, narrow hands with nimble fingers. He wore a gold ring on his pinky with a scrolled symbol she didn’t recognize. Ryan had heard it said those fingers could pick any lock, untie any knot. Watching them, she thought they were more suited for tuning a violin. When she glanced up, she found him watching her with his amused, knowing smile. She channeled her concentration on her strategy.  
  
  Ryan attacked, he defended. He advanced, she countered. Pierce was pleased to have a well-matched partner. She was a cautious player, given to occasional bursts of impulse. He felt her game-playing reflected who she was. She wouldn’t be easily duped or easily beaten. He admired both the quick wits and the strength he sensed in her. It made her beauty all the more appealing.  
  
  Her hands were soft. As he captured her bishop, he wondered idly if her mouth would be, too, and how soon he would find out. He had already decided he would; now it was a matter of timing. Pierce understood the invaluable importance of timing.  
  
  “Checkmate,” he said quietly and heard Ryan’s gasp of surprise.  
  
  She studied the board a moment, then smiled over at him. “Damn, I didn’t see that coming. Are you sure you don’t have a few extra pieces tucked up your sleeve?”  
  
  “Nothing up my sleeve,” Merlin cackled from across the room. Ryan shot him a glance and wondered when he had joined them.  
  
  “I don’t use magic when skill will do,” Pierce told her, ignoring his pet. “You play well, Miss Swan.”  
  
  “You play better, Mr. Atkins.”  
  
  “This time,” he agreed. “You interest me.”  
  
  “Oh?” She met his look levelly. “How?”  
  
  “In several ways.” Sitting back, he ran a finger down the black queen. “You play to win, but you lose well. Is that always true?”  
  
  “No.” She laughed but rose from the table. He was making her nervous again. “Do you lose well, Mr. Atkins?”  
  
  “I don’t often lose.”  
  
  When she looked back, he was standing at another table handling a pack of cards. Ryan hadn’t heard him move. It made her uneasy.  
  
  “Do you know Tarot cards?”  
  
  “No. That is,” she corrected, “I know they’re for telling fortunes or something, aren’t they?”  
  
  “Or something.” He gave a small laugh and shuffled the cards gently. “Mumbo jumbo, Miss Swan. A device to keep someone’s attention focused and to add mystery to quick thinking and observation. Most people prefer to be fooled. Explanations leave them disappointed. Even most realists.”  
  
  “You don’t believe in those cards.” Ryan walked over to join him. “You know you can’t tell the future with pasteboard and pretty colors.”  
  
  “A tool, a diversion.” Pierce lifted his shoulders. “A game, if you like. Games relax me.” Pierce fanned the oversized cards in a quick, effective gesture, then spread them on the table.  
  
  “You do that very well,” Ryan murmured. Her nerves were tight again, but she wasn’t sure why.  
  
  “A basic skill,” he said easily. “I could teach you quickly enough. You have competent hands.” He lifted one, but it was her face he examined, not her palm. “Shall I pick a card?”  
  
  Ryan removed her hand. Her pulse was beginning to race. “It’s your game.”  
  
  With a fingertip, Pierce drew out a card and flipped it faceup. It was the Magician. “Confidence, creativity,” Pierce murmured.  
  
  “You?” Ryan said flippantly to conceal the growing tension.  
  
  “So it might seem.” Pierce laid a finger on another card and drew it out: The High Priestess. “Serenity,” he said quietly. “Strength. You?”  
  
  Ryan shrugged. “Simple enough for you to draw whatever card you like after you’ve stacked the deck.”  
  
  Pierce grinned, unoffended. “The cynic should choose the next to see where these two people will end. Pick a card, Miss Swan,” he invited. “Any card.”  
  
  Annoyed, Ryan plucked one and tossed it faceup on the table. After a strangled gasp, she stared at it in absolute silence. The Lovers. Her heart hammered lightly at her throat.  
  
  “Fascinating,” Pierce murmured. He wasn’t smiling now, but he studied the card as if he’d never seen it before.  
  
  Ryan took a step back. “I don’t like your game, Mr. Atkins.”  
  
  “Hmmm?” He glanced up distractedly, then focused on her. “No? Well then . . .” He carelessly flipped the cards together and stacked them. “I’ll show you to your room.”  
  
  \*\*\*  
  
  Pierce had been as surprised by the card as Ryan had been. But he knew reality was often stranger than any illusion he could devise. He had work to do, a great deal of final planning for his engagement in Las Vegas in two weeks time. Yet as he sat in his room, he was thinking of Ryan, not of the mechanics of his craft.  
  
  There was something about her when she laughed, something brilliant and vital. It appealed to him the same way her low-key, practical voice had appealed to him when she spoke of contracts and clauses.  
  
  He already knew the contract backward and forward. He wasn’t a man to brush aside the business end of his profession. Pierce signed his name to nothing unless he understood every nuance. If the public saw him as mysterious, flashy and odd, that was all to the good. The image was part illusion, part reality. That was the way he preferred it. He had spent the second half of his life arranging things as he preferred them.  
  
  Ryan Swan. Pierce stripped off his shirt and tossed it aside. He wasn’t certain about her just yet. He had fully intended to sign the contracts until he had seen her coming down the stairs. Instinct had made him hesitate. Pierce relied heavily on his instincts. Now he had some thinking to do.  
  
  The cards didn’t influence him. He could make cards stand  
up and dance if that’s what he wanted. But coincidence influenced him. It was odd that Ryan had turned over the card symbolizing lovers when he had been thinking what she would feel like in his arms.  
  
  With a laugh, he sat down and began to doodle on a pad of paper. The plans he was forming for a new escape would have to be torn up or revised, but it relaxed him to turn it over in his mind, just as he turned Ryan over in his mind.  
  
  It might be wise to sign her papers in the morning and send her on her way. He didn’t care to have a woman intrude on his thoughts. But Pierce didn’t always do what was wise. If he did, he would still be playing the club field, pulling rabbits out of his hat and colored scarves out of his pocket at union scale. Now he turned a woman into a panther and walked through a brick wall.  
  
  Poof! he thought. Instant magic. And no one remembered the years of frustration and struggle and failure. That, too, was exactly as he wanted it. There were few who knew where he had come from or who he had been before he was twenty-five.

1n2m926,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1n2m926/one_year_sober/,ONE YEAR SOBER!!,"Today I am one year sober. Technically it’s day 366, but my day 1 was August 28, 2024 so I’m using today as the official marker. 

Last night, after I showered, I slathered my face in an ungodly amount of serums and moisturizers. I was absolutely giddy at how good it felt. It made my whole night just having super moisturized skin!

I’m immensely grateful for my sobriety, and my life and self-esteem are better than I could have ever imagined. Lots of big changes this year — I dropped out of school, started volunteering at a nonprofit for the arts, and was recently offered a full-time job there. I won an award for a short film I made and started submitting to festivals. My Crohn’s disease is in remission. I started learning Japanese and finished two textbooks!

But what I’m most grateful for are the little things; the “non-achievements” of daily life that I had neglected or overlooked when I was in active addiction.

Moisturizing my face. Going to sleep at 10pm and waking up early to enjoy a cold brew coffee while the sun rises. Having an appetite and looking forward to mealtime. Texting and calling my friends back and telling each other about our lives. Giving my little sister advice and encouragement as she transitions into adulthood. Visiting my baby niece and nephew at least once a month and watching them grow up so fast. Turning 28 and realizing that I’m actually proud of myself…dare I say — that I love myself?

Being present and conscious of life as it happens is the greatest gift that sobriety has given me. It makes the good *and* bad times better on every front.

If you’re reading this and struggling, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me or others for support. I’ve had more days 1s than you can imagine and I went through so many crazy phases of sobriety — crazy moods, crazy sleep schedules, crazy eating habits — in the early days I could write a book. At the very least, I hope this post gives you a little hope.

Big thanks to this entire sub for helping me on my journey. Here’s to many more years of this beautiful life.",29,1756410451.0,stopdrinking,8,1.0,False

  “It’s a beautiful lie. It’s the perfect denial.  
  
  Such a beautiful lie to believe in. ”  
  
  \-30 Seconds to Mars, “A Beautiful Lie”  
  
  Eight years later  
  
  Garrett McCarthy hustled down the rickety wooden steps nestled between the wild grass and glanced quickly at his watch, nervously running his fingers through is close-cropped black hair. He squinted his blue eyes at the setting sun as he quickened his pace.  
  
  He made dinner reservations at Parker’s favorite Italian restaurant for eight o'clock. When he knocked on her door at seven-thirty and didn't get an answer, he knew exactly where he'd find her.  
  
  As he walked off the bottom step and his casual, brown lace-up Doc Martins sunk into the sand, he smiled when he saw her.  
  
  She was flat on her stomach right by the water’s edge with her elbows propped up, holding the camera by her eye. Each gentle wave that lapped up onto the shore inched its way around her body before sliding away and rushing back out to sea.  
  
  When she was working on a project, she lost all sense of time. Her current assignment was photographing sand crabs: a freelance piece for National Geographic. Probably not very exciting to some, but it was everything to her. She loved the peacefulness of nature, and having a camera in her hand no matter where she was excited her beyond belief. Holding that small piece of metal in her hand transported her to another time and another place. It made all of her cares disappear so her only concern or worry was for the subject on the other end of her lens. It didn’t matter to her that she wasn’t rushing off to war zones or following news vans. This was who she was. Being a photojournalist was her life’s dream, and she worked her ass off to make sure she achieved it by doing whatever it took to get herself through college all on her own. And it made him respect her even more.  
  
  The push and pull of the water and the click of her camera echoed along the beach as he made his way across the sand to her. When he was a few feet away, he stood with his hands in his pockets, not wanting to disturb her. He liked watching her work. Every time he saw her with that camera in her hands, his heart swelled with pride at how talented she was. And as each wave of water washed over her body, he refused to dwell on the other parts of him that swelled at that moment. Or ever.  
  
  She was one of the best freelance photographers in the country, and over the years she had her photographs featured in hundreds of magazines in the U. S. and was well on her way to becoming the next Ansel Adams. None of those accomplishments were what endeared Parker to him, however. Even without the notoriety and with  
more talent than that of a hundred photographers, she would still be the same generous, intelligent, sweet, and loving person that he’d always known. She didn’t need prestigious awards or featured photos to tell him all of these things. He’d known it since the first moment he laid eyes on her.  
  
  Parker’s latest endeavor: publishing her fourth coffee table book of photos from around the world. Actually, “Anna Parks” had just published her fourth book. He never understood why she insisted on using an alias in print instead of her real name, Annabelle Parker. He was proud of her and thought she should be shouting her accomplishments from the rooftops.  
  
  ""You’re blocking my light,"" she spoke softly as she turned dials and adjusted the settings on her Nikon F2 35mm camera. That camera was as old as she was, but it was her mother’s and she refused to use anything else. Where most photographers went with the times and switched to digital, she stayed true to herself and continued to use a film camera and develop the pictures herself. It made her a huge commodity in the photography world because she was able to play with her photos and make them into masterpieces in her dark room instead of sending them off to a lab and entrusting her work to strangers. She was proud that her pictures were one hundred percent her creations, and it showed in each and every amazing image she captured. Whenever anyone would try to convince her that digital was better, she would remind them that it didn’t matter if you owned the most expensive, most advanced camera that was on the market. If you didn’t have the talent or the heart, your pictures would still turn out crappy no matter how much money you spent or how many rave reviews your camera got. Being able to take your photos through every part of the process, from conception to watching them come to life in the trays of chemicals under the haze of the red safe light, forced you to look at your work under a microscope, literally, and learn how to best tell a story without words.  
  
  “And you’re going to make us late for dinner. Again,” he reminded her dryly.  
  
  She clicked a few more pictures and then lifted the camera above her head so he could take it from her. Once it was secured in his hands, she placed both of hers in the wet sand and pushed herself up just as another small wave washed up around her feet.  
  
  She brushed her hands together a few times to get some of the sand off and then looked up into his face. She could tell he was irritated with her. One of his eyebrows was raised as if he were waiting for an explanation.  
  
  “Don’t start with me, McCarthy. You knew I had to finish these photos before we went to dinner. I don’t even know why we’re doing this. You know I don’t like to make a big fuss,” she complained as she tried in vain to wipe off the sand from her bare stomach. All she managed to do was spread it around.  
  
  He just stood there staring at her. If he spoke right now it would probably come out as a squeak or mumbled nonsense. As soon as she had stood up, all of the blood rushed from his head right to his dick.  
  
  She was wearing a pale blue bandeau bikini top that tied around her neck and matching bottoms. He only knew they matched because the white wrap-around skirt she wore was wet and see-through as it clung to every inch of her hips and thighs, grazing just above her knees. He watched her brush her hands against her small, firm stomach and it was starting to irritate him. His hands itched to reach out and do it for her, to touch her skin and feel her warmth.  
  
  Dangerous territory. He had no business thinking those things. She was his friend and she deserved better than his habitual dirty thoughts.  
  
  “Quit your bitching, Parker. It’s your birthday. What kind of a friend would I be if I didn’t take you out to celebrate?”  
  
  “Oh, I don’t know. How about a good one? I hate my birthday. You know that. All that fuss just to be one day closer to death. It’s idiotic. ” She huffed as she finally gave up on removing the offending sand from her skin.  
  
  Garrett sent up a silent prayer for that until she untied the flimsy, wet scrap of material from around her waist and started to wring it out into the sand.  
  
  He didn’t know what was worse, staring at her bikini bottoms and skin through the haze of wet material or having her stand in front of him practically in her underwear with all that bare, golden skin showing, talking to him like it was no big deal.  
  
  Because it was no big deal, he reminded himself. It wasn't like he had never seen her in her bathing suit before. . . or her underwear for that matter. But that was a mistake. It was over a year ago, she was drunk, and really, it could have happened to anyone.  
  
  “You know why we’re doing this,” Garrett said softly, cocking his head to the side as he forced himself to look at her eyes and not any lower.  
  
  She hated when he looked at her like that, with those bright blue eyes the same color as the ocean that made her melt. How many times over the years had she needed to force herself not to run her hands down the side of his face when he had looked at her like that? Too many to count, that was for sure. Sometimes she wondered if he knew the power he had over her and did things like that just to see if he could get a reaction out of her.  
  
  Parker pictured herself cupping his cheek in her hand and smoothing away the sadness. As quickly as the image appeared, her chest constricted with guilt when his words broke through her errant thoughts.  
  
  “He took you out to dinner on your birthday every year, even if he had to do it with you kicking and screaming,” Garrett said with a smile to soften the blow he was sure his words brought. “It’s my duty as your friend and his to carry on that tradition, especially this year. ”  
  
  Especially this year, especially this year. . . The words repeated on a loop in her head.  
  
  It still didn’t seem real; the first birthday in eight years spent without him. He’d been gone for six months, and she still woke up every day expecting to hear him walk through the door, laugh outrageously loud at something stupid, or get snippy with her when she asked him where he’d been all night.  
  
  She wasn’t going to let those dark thoughts mess with her mind. Not right now. And definitely not tonight. She’d spent too much time already lately wondering “What if?” and thinking about all of the things she could have done differently. Her guilt that most of those feelings revolved around the man standing next to her than on the one she’d given her heart to took up too much residence in her mind and her heart as it was.  
Garrett was hurting too. He’d spent the past six months being her rock and making sure she remembered to eat, shower, work, and anything else she forgot to do when the memories and sadness threatened to overwhelm her. He needed her to be strong for once, and she was determined to do just that. Even if it meant she had to celebrate her birthday.  
  
  “Fine. But I draw the line at strangers crowding around the table singing ‘Happy Birthday’ like a bunch of jackasses. ”  
  
  “Deal. ” Garrett laughed.  
  
  They turned and made their way across the beach and up the stairs to her condo talking about birthdays past.  
  
  An hour and a half later they were seated at a back corner table at Sorrento’s just finishing up their meal. Sorrento’s was a small, family owned restaurant on the outskirts of town. The tables were covered with green vinyl and the booths with red leather. Pictures of Italy and old Sicilian families littered the walls and the white, silk carnation covered in dust in the center of their table had seen better days. Garrett liked to tease Parker by calling her favorite place a “hole in the wall. ” Luckily, the amazing food made up for the less than perfect atmosphere.  
  
  Parker was wiping the corner of her mouth with her napkin as Garrett sat watching her.  
  
  His best friend was gorgeous. There was no denying that. If it was possible, she was even more beautiful than the first day he met her, and he was stunned stupid when he laid eyes on her all those years ago in the coffee shop just off campus.  
  
  After a quick shower at her condo when they had got back from the beach earlier, she had let her naturally wavy hair air dry. The auburn waves had golden highlights from the sun and hung down past her shoulders.  
  
  He watched as she used her fingers to sweep her long bangs out of her eyes at the dinner table. Garrett always had the urge to do that for her. How many times had the three of them, and some random hook-up he’d found, been out to dinner over the years when his hand would raise on its own accord to smooth the hair away from her face? One time he even had to pass it off by quickly signaling the waitress for another drink.  
  
  Even if Parker didn't like celebrating her birthday, she still liked dressing up and going out. When she had got out of the shower, she chose an olive colored strapless mini dress that had a relaxed top all the way down to her hips. It hugged the tops of her thighs and her perfectly round bottom tightly, featuring gold-studded detailing that accentuated her toned physique. This was her favorite dress to wear when her skin started to darken from the summer sun and she was in the mood to feel sexy.  
  
  She was glad Garrett chose to dress up as well. He looked good in anything he wore, but when she stood up from her spot in the sand earlier and saw him in a pair of black dress pants and a long sleeved blue button down with the sleeves pushed up to his elbows, it was enough to make her mouth water. It reminded her that it had been far too long since she last saw him in the clean, crisp lines of his Navy Service Dress Whites. The pants, with a permanent military crease that ran down the front, showed off his muscular legs, and the tailored jacket hugged his well-defined chest and broad shoulders. How many times had she stood in rapt attention when he shot his cuffs and adjusted his collar?  
  
  Her precarious thoughts were threatening to consume her, so it was a good thing Garrett chose that moment to place a small, gift-wrapped box on the table in front of her as the waitress cleared their plates.  
  
  Parker’s eyes lit up and she clapped her hands together, practically bouncing up and down in her seat with excitement.  
  
  ""You hate birthdays yet pee your pants over presents. There is clearly something wrong with you,"" Garrett joked.  
  
  ""Shut up and give me my present,"" she replied with a sassy tone.  
  
  He shook his head and laughed as he slid the box across the table towards her.  
  
  She reached out and snatched it up into her hands and tore the wrapping paper off in three seconds flat.  
  
  ""Hey, I took a lot of care wrapping that present and you didn't even appreciate it. "" Garrett pouted.  
  
  ""Oh you did not,"" she fired back. ""You wouldn't know how to wrap a present if your life depended on it. Who did you con into doing your dirty work for you this time?"" She asked with a raise of one of her eyebrows. ""Tiffani with an 'I', Bambi, Destiny. . . ""  
  
  Garrett feigned a look of indignation that she would suggest such a thing, but unfortunately she was right.  
  
  Over the years he never had a shortage of women at his disposal. Some would say he was trying to overcompensate for the fact that the only woman he had ever wanted, he could never have. But Garrett would never say that. He was just bored and he tired easily of the same thing day after day. He needed variety. It was the spice of life after all, right?  
  
  Parker slid open one of the flaps of the box, and Garrett gave up the staring contest. He would never win anyway. She knew him too well.  
  
  ""Alright, fine. It was Buffy,"" he admitted with a roll of his eyes.  
  
  She barked out a laugh at his attempt to hide who he really was from her. She'd seen so many women come and go from his life over the years that she couldn't keep up. She never understood why he didn't just find a nice girl and settle down, even though the thought of it made her chest ache.  
  
  The smile dropped from her face when she opened up the last flap and saw what was in the box.  
  
  Garrett bit his lip nervously, worried about her reaction to the gift. Every year for her birthday his friend had showered her with lavish, expensive jewelry: diamond earrings, a ruby necklace, an emerald bracelet. Every year Garrett tried to convince him to give Parker something more meaningful. Something she wanted and wished for. Something that actually showed he cared and not how much money he shelled out. Parker wasn't the flashy jewelry type but every year he draped her in expensive gemstones that Garrett rarely, if ever, saw her wear.  
  
  He sat there second-guessing his decision for sixty-eight seconds while Parker stared wordlessly down into the box. Was she sad that she didn't get her usual gift of jewelry? Did it make her miss him even more? Garrett wanted to try and keep things the same for her this year, but it just didn't seem right to buy her something he usually did. That was one thing he couldn't do.  
  
  Before he could panic for another second, Parker’s voice rang out, causing several of the other patrons to look their way.  
  
  ""Oh my God. Garrett, where did you find this? I can't believe you did this!""  
  
  The smile on Parker’s face grew so big she thought she might get a cramp in her cheek. She had been looking for a lens to fit her mother's camera for three years. She had called every photography store all over the world and no one carried it anymore. She knew her camera was a dinosaur, but she couldn't bring herself to part with it. That camera was the only thing she had left of her mother since her father had decided to give every single thing to Goodwill two days after she died. Thank God her mother had given her the camera long before then.  
  
  Parker delicately pulled the long, black cylinder out of the box and turned it around every which way to get a good look at it.  
  
  ""Garrett, I can't believe you found this. How in the world. . . where did. . . it must have. . . ""  
  
  Listening to her fumble with words and reverently inspect the lens made Garrett realize he had made the right decision with the gift. Not to mention the fact that hearing her speak his name made him twitch in his pants. When Garrett and Milo had met Parker, she quickly became one of them and adopted their ingrained military habit of calling everyone by their surname. It had been too long since he had heard his first name tumble past her lips.  
  
  ""I cannot reveal my sources, Parker. Let's just say that sometimes it pays to have top secret military clearance,"" Garrett said with a wink.  
  
  The funny thing was Parker was pretty sure he wasn't joking. Knowing his way around computers like he did definitely had its perks.  
  
  Parker gently placed the lens back in the box, stood up, and made her way around to where Garrett sat. He tossed the napkin fr  
om his lap onto the table and stood up quickly as soon as she left her chair, always the gentleman. When she got to him, she didn’t hesitate to mold her body to his and wrap her arms around his neck.  
  
  Parker was a hugger. He had learned that about her quickly, and over the years Garrett had to try not to cringe whenever she got too close to him. He would never admit just how much it excited him when she pressed her body into to his and he could feel every single inch of her curves and softness. And therein laid the problem. When she got that close, he got excited—literally. Her skin, her smell, her breasts pushing up against his chest, all of it made his dick stand at attention. But of course he chalked that up to a normal reaction he would have around any gorgeous woman.  
  
  Garrett quickly wrapped his arms around Parker and returned the hug. Anything else would just be rude. They were friends, after all, and friends hugged all the time.  
  
  “Thank you so much, Garrett. The gift is perfect,” she whispered against his cheek. Her warm breath floating around his ear and the way she softly said his name again made him grind his teeth. She always smelled like coconuts, beach, and fresh air, and tonight was no different. He breathed her in and held the scent inside his lungs, letting it burrow down inside him like he always did.  
  
  Parker pulled her head away so she could look at his face, and her breath caught in her throat. His usual pale blue eyes had darkened, and he stared at her like she was something to eat. Butterflies beat furiously in her stomach but as soon as she blinked, the look was gone, replaced by soft eyes and a friendly smile. She forced herself to smile back at him and not make the moment awkward, even though she was still wrapped tightly in his arms. She wondered, not for the first time, what he would do if she leaned forward and kissed him. Their faces were so close she wouldn’t need to move very far. Just a few small inches and her lips could be pressed up against his, and she could finally see if he tasted as good as he looked.  
  
  “I’m sure you’d probably rather have a diamond bracelet or watch like all the other years, but my measly gift will have to do. ”  
  
  Garrett tried to inject humor into his voice, but he knew exactly what he was doing when he said those words.  
  
  He was putting the wall back up between them. With one sentence, he made her feel guilty for staring at his mouth and pressing up against him. It was like he knew exactly where her thoughts were headed, and he wanted to put an end to them before they even began. His loyalty was always something Parker admired about him. Even though it wasn’t his idea to apply to the Naval Academy, the education was top notch and the lessons he learned there were part of him now. He was military through and through—and loyal to a fault. She was his best friend’s girl, end of story. It didn’t matter if his best friend was gone. That was just the way it had to be.  
  
  Garrett paid the bill and as they walked out into the warm night air, Parker linked her arm through his and rested her head on his shoulder. She wouldn’t allow her feelings to ruin anything between them. Regardless of what she felt, Garrett was her friend first. She couldn’t bear the thought of ever losing him.  
  
  He smiled as he looked down at her. Being with Parker was the only time he was ever truly happy. It was also the only time he felt guilty, confused, and pissed off at the way his life had turned out.  
  
  They walked arm-in-arm down the sidewalk, the silence between them easy, just like always.  
  
  A sparkle suddenly caught his eye when the bright light of the moon hit the diamond ring hanging on a chain around her neck, dousing his good mood like a bucket of ice water. Parker took to wearing the ring around her neck a few months ago. That four carat princess cut solitaire had always been a reminder of just how much he had screwed up when he first met her. Right then it was a reminder of the news he had to tell her.  
  
  Garrett wanted more than anything to not have to tell Parker on her birthday, but he had no choice.  
  
  Garrett stopped in the middle of the sidewalk right outside her condo and turned to face Parker, a serious expression on his face. She knew immediately that something was wrong. And if she was being honest, she knew something was wrong when she first saw him today. At the time she just chalked it up to the typical melancholy that came with the daily reminders there was one person missing from their threesome.  
  
  She knew better now as she watched him shove his hands in his pockets and look down at his feet instead of at her.  
  
  Being the receiver of plenty of bad news over the years, Parker held her breath out of habit as he started to speak.  
  
  ""I'm not going to draw this out or try to sugar coat it. I know you well enough to know you'll see through any attempt I try at making this easier for you. I've been given new orders. I ship out tomorrow,"" Garrett stated bluntly.  
  
  She let out the breath she'd been holding and looked at him in confusion.  
  
  ""But you're a tech guy. They only use you when it’s an emergency, right? Aren’t you like. . . their last resort?”  
  
  Parker knew the risks of being friends with someone in the military. She was also well aware of the main risk of loving someone that was in the military - they could be ordered away at any time. Being a Navy SEAL obviously meant you were always at their beck and call. Garrett shuffled his feet and smoothed his hand down his face like he was trying to wipe away his emotions. He chewed on his bottom lip and looked anywhere but at her, all telltale signs he was nervously thinking of a way to drop something else in her lap. Parker reached up and placed her hand on his cheek, forcing him to look her in the eyes.  
  
  ""Thank you so much for the vote of confidence. Technically, yes, I’m only called in when it’s absolutely necessary. But I volunteered to do this job when it was first brought to my attention,"" he admitted quietly.  
  
  Parker searched his eyes, trying to see what was going on inside his head. He was nervous. And it scared the hell out of her. Garrett didn’t get nervous. He was a rock, stable and steady, never losing focus or faltering in any way.",1,1756410296.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Had diarrhea and constipation constantly (it was switching). Also under my left rib it was clicking (still is). Couldn’t eat tomatoes, alcohol, coffee, sweets, garlic, beans, corn and other vegetables etc.

As a lot of you I was on endoscopy, colonoscopy - all clear. 

Last year I started taking zoloft for anxiety, it helped my anxiety but gut remained the same. About 2 months ago I added bupropion (Welloft) and after surviving first 2 weeks, the miracle happened. Shortly - now I can eat almost anything (EVEN DRINK ALCOHOL!). 

Yes I still get diarrhea sometimes (but not as near as much as before!!). And I don’t overthink it if it happens.

So my conclusion is that IBS is really caused from bad nerves between brain and gut. AD helped in my case! Also don’t stress about work etc.. be more careless :) hope it helps someone ",3,1756410286.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

*Because Why Settle for One Bet When You Can Double the Thrill (and the Risk)?*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Unless They’re on a Miami Pitcher)**  
The New York Mets (-220) are the heavy favorites here, which translates to an implied probability of **68.75%** to win. For context, the Miami Marlins (+310) have just a **24.1%** chance, per the odds. That’s like giving a toddler a slingshot and expecting them to take down a jet fighter.

Statistically, the Mets are a well-oiled hitting machine:

* **Offense**: 176 home runs (8th in MLB), .424 slugging (8th), and a .248 average. Juan Soto (.251, 32 HRs) and Pete Alonso (.264, 29 HRs) are the nuclear reactors.
* **Pitching**: 3.83 ERA (9th), 8.7 K/9. Clay Holmes (3.60 ERA, 109 Ks in 137 IP) is as reliable as a coffee maker in Manhattan.

The Marlins? They’re the MLB version of a group project that forgot to meet:

* **Offense**: 128 HRs (25th), .249 average. Xavier Edwards (.288) is their lone bright spot.
* **Pitching**: 4.58 ERA (24th), 14 HRs allowed in their last 10 games. Janson Junk (4.09 ERA) starts for Miami, which is… *charming*.

**Key Matchup Take**: The Mets’ offense vs. the Marlins’ pitching is like ordering a fire extinguisher to put out a campfire. It’s not a fair fight.

---

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Debutants, and a Sprained Sense of Hope**

* **Mets Injuries**: Francisco Álvarez (10-day IL, thumb) and Drew Smith (60-day IL, elbow) are out. Ouch. But with Soto, Lindor, and Alonso healthy, the Mets are still the Yankees’ richer, cooler cousin.
* **Marlins Debut**: Adam Mazur makes his season debut for Miami. Good luck, Adam! You’re facing the Mets’ offense, which has hit **18 HRs in their last 10 games**. That’s more home runs than the Marlins have hit in a month.

**Recent News**: The Mets have won **85.7% of games** when -220 or better this season. The Marlins? They’ve only won **46.8% as underdogs**. If you’ve ever bet on a team with a 47% chance to win, you k

  “Which one of you lucky bastards is nailing Kelsey?” Rhys Adams leaned against the back of the sofa, beer in hand, and glanced at the other two men. “It isn’t me, and she glows too much to be going without.”  
  
  Jeremy Beck raised a dark brow. “I assumed it was one of you, since she’s put me firmly in the boss category.”  
  
  Tucker Hall eyed the object of their mutual desire through the window as she bustled around the patio table, setting the last of the party favors in place. She wore another of those long, summery skirts that hid her lush ass. But in deference to the early September heat, she’d donned a little white tank top that hugged the ripe curves of her breasts. Sunlight poured golden over her pale skin and mahogany curls. Kels was like something out of time, one of those women who could have modeled for the masters of oil and canvas long ago. Just a glance at her made his dick stiff. Fantasies of her on her back, legs splayed for him, could make him come in record time.  
  
  “I guess Tucker is the lucky winner,” Rhys groused.  
  
  “Me?” He jerked his gaze back to the other guys. “No. I’m stuck in the friend zone, man. She put me there when we were four, and I haven’t been out since.”  
  
  “At least she’s put you two in a category,” Rhys complained. “I don’t think she knows I’m alive half the time unless she runs out of coffee or needs me to fix her cantankerous bathtub. Then she needs a good neighbor.”  
  
  A collective quiet settled over the trio as they all contemplated the question that Jeremy finally voiced. “Who, then?”  
  
  “No one at night,” Rhys offered. “I’ve got sweet views inside her bedroom.”  
  
  And he didn’t hesitate to take advantage of them, Tucker would bet. Unscrupulous but lucky bastard.  
  
  “She’s always home and always alone,” he went on. “Unless you count battery-operated boyfriends.”  
  
  “You’ve seen her masturbate?” Jeremy nearly came out of his chair.  
  
  Tucker nearly came, period.  
  
  Rhys smiled. “Oh, yeah. Our Kelsey has a healthy sex drive.” His smile took a nosedive. “She’s just not getting any from me, at least not while she’s at home. At the office? Nooners, maybe?”  
  
  Jeremy shook his head. “No. I keep her busy, half because I can’t stand the thought she could get laid at lunch, and I wouldn’t be participating.”  
  
  “The only time she disappears is to go to your place,” Rhys pointed out to Tucker, his look expectant.  
  
  “I swear, as much as I’d love to lie, we watch action flicks together, but we’re not making any action. I’ve tried a hundred times to think of ways I could bring sex up without ruining the friendship—or having her laugh in my face. So far, I’m striking out.”  
  
  Silence lingered. Tucker bet that, individually, the trio had often wondered who Kelsey shared that sweet body with. Frankly, his money had been on Jeremy. Tall, dark, handsome, rich, intense . . . What woman wouldn’t want that? Except Kels had never been a typical woman. She liked Stallone movies, football, and beer. In the same week, she might also salsa dance, buy a Coach purse, and then attend a lecture at the local college about the discovery of new black holes in the universe. She was always a puzzle.  
  
  This was the first time they’d ever discussed their mutual desire for Kelsey. Sure, he’d known the other two were hard for her. Rhys practically followed her with his tongue dragging the floor, and Jeremy watched her with those sharp, dark eyes that missed nothing. Like the others, he’d assumed one of them was Kelsey’s lover. Unless someone was lying, this conversation gave him a lot of hope.  
  
  “So ...” Rhys started. “If she’s not doing the horizontal mambo with her best friend, her boss, or her neighbor, who the hell is she fucking?”  
  
  The answer came to Tucker like a comet through his brain. He drowned the sizzle it roused with a long swallow of beer. Or tried to. Nothing doused his need for Kels.  
  
  “No one,” he said finally. “She was twenty-one when she lost her virginity.”  
  
  Tucker remembered it vividly, though he’d really like to forget. Alex the smooth talker had finally persuaded her onto her back by lying about his feelings for her. Kelsey had called Tucker in furious tears when she’d discovered that his feelings only lasted as long as the orgasm and extended to the next coed a week later. His Kels never gave herself easily, and since Alex, she never did unless she was sure. As far as he knew, she’d had only one other lover, David, the musician she’d nearly married. Close call, that. But Tucker couldn’t fault her. He’d genuinely liked David, even if he’d been jealous as hell. Kelsey had been the one to decide that twenty-three was too young to get married. David, at thirty, hadn’t wanted to wait. They parted, no harm, no foul. She even exchanged Christmas cards with David and his wife.  
  
  Many tried to get into Kelsey’s panties. She took none of them seriously. He, Jeremy, and Rhys were good examples.  
  
  “Yeah, she doesn’t sleep around that I can see,” Rhys agreed.  
  
  “She’s never so much as flirted with anyone at the office.”  
  
  “And that leaves us where?” Rhys asked.  
  
  “Fucked, and not in the pleasant way.” Tucker sighed. “Plan, anyone?”  
  
  Kelsey Rose Rena cast a nervous glance inside the living room. Her guys were talking intently. They’d all been a part of her life for at least the last three years, so they knew each other. Were even friends . . . of a sort. But she’d bet none of them had a clue how she felt about them all. She feared their reaction if they did.  
  
  Thank God this party would be under way soon. Let someone else wade through the testosterone in her living room. Once it had started getting thick, she’d had to dash outside. It was either that or overheat.  
  
  “Need help, Kels?” Tucker stuck his head out the French doors.  
  
  That wild wavy brown hair of his made her hands itch to trim it, run her fingers through it. But his blue eyes melted her every time. He had the biggest heart—and the sexiest smile she’d ever seen.  
  
  “I’m good. But could you guys find that cooler in the garage and ice down the drinks in the fridge?”  
  
  “Will do.” He hesitated. “You okay?”  
  
  She avoided his gaze. If she looked at him—at any of them—no telling what her eyes would reveal. Jeremy would be furious, Tucker hurt, and Rhys . . . he’d figure it out as he went.  
  
  Focused on the plastic flatware she set on her patio table, Kelsey murmured, “Great. When people start coming in, just send them out back.”  
  
  Tucker sighed. Something was off with him, with all of the guys. It wasn’t football season yet, so no one’s favorite team had lost recently. Tucker never let work stress him out. She wondered if he was having girlfriend trouble . . . then decided she didn’t want to know.  
  
  The door shut, and she breathed a sigh of relief. If she could just make it through the afternoon with those three, then shoo them out after the party, she could escape to her fantasy life. At least four hours to go. Damn! She glanced at her watch and started counting . . .  
  
  “Anything?” Jeremy asked as soon as he shut the door.  
  
  “Nah, man. She’s in her own world.” One that didn’t include them. Tucker resisted the urge to curse.  
  
  “What do you think she wants in a man?” Rhys asked.  
  
  “If I were an expert, I wouldn’t be telling you. I’d be dating her myself.”  
  
  Jeremy nodded. “She doesn’t seem to care about money. God knows, I tried that route.”  
  
  “Nope.” Tucker grabbed another beer, then headed for the garage, motioning the others to join him. “She’s more than comfortable with her ability to make her own money.”  
  
  “She’s also not impressed by anything with a fast engine. I tried that, too,” Jeremy confessed.  
  
  “Hey, I mowed my lawn shirtless for a month, then struck up conversations with her, hopi  
ng she’d look. Her gaze stayed glued above my neck.”  
  
  Rhys was a fireman and spent nearly all his downtime pumping iron. If Kels was going to be wowed by some guy’s body, it would be Rhys’s.  
  
  Tucker retrieved the cooler, then opened the freezer in her garage and started dumping in bags of ice. The others joined in.  
  
  “I’ve been her confidant, her shoulder to cry on, her prom date when hers dumped her at the last minute . . . None of that did me any good either.”  
  
  “You knew David. What was he like?” Jeremy spoke in low tones. Always. Yet his voice carried the snap of subtle demand.  
  
  “Easygoing. Big sense of humor. Kind of a wandering spirit.”  
  
  “That leaves me out,” Jeremy brooded as he began to toss beers, wine coolers, water, and soft drinks into the cooler.  
  
  “But her boyfriend prior to that was a successful guy who owned a few jewelry stores. Flashy dresser. Of course, he was an asshole, too. I don’t think she would put you in that mold or you wouldn’t be here,” he told Jeremy, then wondered why he was trying to make the competition feel better.  
  
  Truth was, he liked both Jeremy and Rhys. And it felt good to finally be talking about the elephant in the room.  
  
  They finished icing down the drinks in relative quiet, but Tucker’s brain was working overtime. A glance at Jeremy—whose brain never stopped—proved Kelsey’s boss was lost in his own ruminations, too.  
  
  Until he spoke. “Would all of you agree that we’d rather see Kelsey happy with one of us than some bastard who might mistreat her?”  
  
  Tucker hesitated, then glanced at Rhys. Finally, they both nodded. Yeah, he’d hate like hell to let her go, but if he couldn’t have her, he’d at least be happier knowing that she was with someone who wanted her, had genuine feelings for her, would take care of her.  
  
  “Me, too,” Jeremy offered. “I think Tucker is right, gentlemen. What we need is a plan.”  
  
  “Plan?”  
  
  Tucker laughed at Rhys’s confusion. The firefighter was a great guy . . . but Rhys and a plan combined as well as gasoline and margarita mix.  
  
  “We’ve got to find out what’s in her head.” And her heart, Tucker decided. But they had to start small. Forever and ever amen, picket fence, and two point two kids was a lofty place to begin. First, they had to know what she wanted in a date, in a lover. Who, if anyone, was on her mind.  
  
  “How?” Jeremy asked, getting right to the heart of the problem as usual. “Does she keep a diary?”  
  
  “Not that I know of . . . but it’s not as if Kels tells me everything.” Tucker shrugged, lamenting that fact.  
  
  “She might have a journal. No doubt she’s capable of writing more than a grocery list,” Rhys drawled.  
  
  “Kels is a bit private. I’m not sure she’d write her feelings down.”  
  
  “Maybe because she is private, she’d be more likely to pour her feelings out on paper than to another human being.” Jeremy pinned his gaze on Tucker. “Or does she have some really close girlfriend I don’t know about?”  
  
  “No. To her, most women like shopping and gossip and those Grey’s Anatomy-type shows, which she hates.”  
  
  Rhys frowned. “Yeah. Not Kelsey’s style.”  
  
  “So now what?” Tucker ran his hand through his unruly hair.  
  
  “Could you have one of those best friend heart-to-hearts?”  
  
  “Yeah.” Rhys warmed to the subject. “See if she’ll spill.”  
  
  “Tried that. She blushed and said that talking to me about her fantasies and her ultimate man was crossing the friend line. I told her it was because I was seeking a girlfriend and wanted her advice. She was sure that her wants wouldn’t necessarily match anyone else’s and ended the conversation.”  
  
  “Damn.”  
  
  “Exactly. There must be some way to trip her up or persuade her into a tell-all mood so we can learn what she wants and who she has feelings for,” Jeremy murmured.  
  
  “Get her drunk?”  
  
  Tucker reached over and swatted Rhys on the head. “No, you idiot. Something that won’t have her puking or give her a headache. You know Kels doesn’t handle her liquor well. I’d rather try something less sneaky.”  
  
  When Tucker reached down to lift one half of the enormous cooler by a handle, Rhys lifted the other. “I would too, brother, but the up-and-up isn’t working.”  
  
  Jeremy held the garage door open. “He’s right.”  
  
  “What are you suggesting?” Tucker asked. “Seducing her?”  
  
  “Tried that.” Jeremy sighed as they traversed the house, cooler in hand. “She sidestepped me, then set me up on a blind date with a Barbie who had an equally plastic personality.”  
  
  “I tried, too.” Rhys lowered the cooler by the back door, then glanced out at Kelsey, who stood in the shade, face raised to the sky, eyes closed, basking in the sun. “She giggled and started making jokes about firemen who think with their hose.”  
  
  “I can’t seduce her,” Tucker admitted. “First, I’m not a ladies’ man, and second, I’d lose her. She thinks of me as someone she can rely on—”  
  
  “Which is why you’re stuck in the friend zone, dude,” Rhys chastised. “You’ve never tried to make her see you as a man?”  
  
  “I kissed her once.”  
  
  “Yeah?” That got Rhys’s attention.  
  
  “But we were thirteen, and her comment afterward was that Josh Smith kissed better.”  
  
  Rhys doubled over with laughter. Even single-minded Jeremy cracked a smile.  
  
  “What we need is evidence.”  
  
  Golden brow raised, Rhys glared at Jeremy. “Spoken like an attorney.”  
  
  “I am one; sue me.” The attorney smiled, and something about his eyes reminded Tucker why the guy billed out at two grand an hour. Suddenly, he shot Rhys a cunning stare. “You firemen have interesting ways of gaining access to a house, right?”  
  
  Rhys rolled his eyes. “Yes, with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.”  
  
  “I have a key, guys,” Tucker offered.  
  
  “Give it to him,” Jeremy snapped. “I’m going to call Kelsey after the party, make up some emergency. You”—he stared at Rhys—“are going to sneak in. Look around, in that monster closet of hers, through her home office. . . See if she keeps a journal or mementos or has written anything personal on her laptop. Check her correspondence, her voice mails. Scroll through her recent calls and see if she’s reached out to anyone.”  
  
  “I don’t know, dude . . . It seems so invasive. What about her privacy? What if she catches me?”  
  
  Jeremy’s stare lost what little levity it had. He looked as if he were resisting grabbing Rhys by the shirt and shaking some sense into him. “Be careful, and she won’t. Just get us some information or we’ll all be stuck in this hell indefinitely.”  
  
  Rhys sighed. “Fuck.”  
  
  “Call both of us as soon as you’ve finished your reconnaissance.” Jeremy directed. “Then collectively we’ll decide the best course of action, regardless of what you find, agreed?”  
  
  “Count me in.”  
  
  Tucker hesitated. He didn’t like spying on Kels. He didn’t like lying to her or invading her privacy . . . but he also didn’t like being cut off from the woman he adored. He hadn’t made any progress with her since that chaste tweener kiss. Fifteen years later, maybe it was time to try something new.  
  
  Hoping like hell he didn’t regret this, he handed Rhys Kelsey’s house key.  
  
  CHAPTER | TWO  
  
  The party had been pure torture. Labor Day festivities, cold beer, and good friends aside, the sight of Kelsey in a bloodred bikini had nearly been Rhys’s undoing. The pale swells of her breasts nearly spilling out of her top, that ridiculously small waist above outrageously lush hips and thighs . . . Damn, he got  hard all over again just thinking about her.  
  
  Too bad he wasn’t the only one hard for Kelsey. Rhys grimaced. Tucker’s feelings for her were deep and true and abiding, and Jeremy, a man everyone knew played for keeps, intended to make her his submissive. Still, Rhys refused to be strong-armed out of Kelsey’s life by loyalty or authority. He burned for her every bit as much as the others.  
  
  Soon, he would make her see that. Somehow.  
  
  Jeremy might have provided a plan so they could learn Kelsey’s feelings. Tucker might have provided the key so they could research what might be in her heart. But Rhys intended to take full advantage of the opportunity to make her his own.  
  
  He’d sneaked away during the party earlier and done something designed to ensure that Kelsey would call Rhys tonight after her pretend assignment from her boss, then invite him inside. All he had to do was wait.  
  
  Pacing his bedroom, he stared out the window again—straight into Kelsey’s. His beautiful neighbor never closed her blinds, thank God.  
  
  Finally, she entered the room and stripped off her cover-up. The bikini top came next, then the bottoms—and she stood blessedly bare. And gorgeous.  
  
  Rhys wished like hell that walls, windows, and fences didn’t separate them. He’d kill to see that beautiful skin up close. Touch it.  
  
  But to achieve his personal mission, he had to serve the collective one first. Quickly, he sent a text to Jeremy:  
  
  Everyone is finally gone. Call her now.  
  
  Less than thirty seconds later, Kelsey jumped, threw the cover-up over her head, and darted back down the hall.  
  
  A minute later, Rhys was quiet as he opened her front door with Tucker’s key and slipped inside, locking it behind him. Yeah, he should probably wait to see if Jeremy could get her out of the house on this “errand,” but impatience chafed. Besides, to leave, Kelsey would have to change clothes . . . which meant she would get naked first. He couldn’t bypass the opportunity to see her up close and personal.  
  
  Once inside, Rhys heard Kelsey on the phone, pacing the kitchen. The deferential tones she used with Jeremy set his teeth on edge.  
  
  “I’ve had too much to drink to drive to the office tonight, sir, but I promise I’ll be in early and finish proofing that brief for you.”  
  
  A moment later, she added, “I had two more margaritas after you left.” Then, “I didn’t realize you’d need my help tonight.” She sighed. “I realize that’s not good for me. I’m sorry, sir.”  
  
  Kelsey fidgeted. “No, I don’t have lunch plans.” Another pause. “My job is to help you however I can, sir. I’ll plan on attending the meeting with you. Do you need me to make lunch reservations?”  
  
  Rhys grimaced at Kelsey’s tone. She sounded breathless, almost aroused. Her boss liked to tie women up and order them around. On one hand, it bothered him. His independent Kelsey into that? Really? On the other hand, the thought of seeing Kelsey bound and ready to take whatever he wanted to give her excited the hell out of him. He liked the vision better without Jeremy in it.  
  
  Sighing, Rhys shoved the thought aside and crept through the foyer, past the living room, circling the back of the dining room, then peeking his head around the corner into the kitchen and den. He was in luck; Kelsey was looking out the French doors into her shadowed backyard, submissively responding to yet another of Jeremy Beck’s commands.  
  
  Fuck.  
  
  He’d worry about her boss later. After all, she might be intrigued by Jeremy, but she hadn’t let him touch her. Maybe she didn’t have any real feelings for the guy and simply reacted instinctively to the command in a boss’s voice. He hoped like hell that deference didn’t mean anything.  
  
  Rhys entered her darkened hallway, then crept to her guest room/home office and shut the door behind him.  
  
  Her computer hummed quietly. A quick search of her files revealed nothing more than a few tax records, her playlists, family photos, and mostly work-related e-mails. She was still logged into her Facebook account, but her wall held greetings from a handful of high school friends wishing her a happy Labor Day. Nothing from a lover.  
  
  Next, Rhys picked up her cell phone, which sat beside her laptop. He scanned her recent incoming and outgoing calls. Her mother, her aunt, her cousin, Jeremy, Tucker, and himself, period. If she had a lover, she wasn’t communicating with him, and that wasn’t Kelsey’s style.  
  
  Shit. Now what? Maybe she kept a journal. He looked around the little room, rummaged through her desk drawers. Other than bills and house papers, they were empty. Maybe the diary was in her bedroom . . .  
  
  Tiptoeing across the hall, Rhys could hear Kelsey murmuring something in more of those worshipful tones that made him grit his teeth. Lucky bastard, Jeremy.  
  
  With a shake of his head, Rhys slipped into Kelsey’s private domain and spied her little red bikini on the pale carpet. His cock hardened in a painful rush. She’d looked fabulous in it, laughing, playing hostess, so natural and unaware of how gorgeous she looked with dancing dark eyes and her riot of brownish-red curls. He knew she looked even better without the bikini.  
  
  “No, sir. Really, I’m tipsy. And tired. I promise I’ll be in early.”  
  
  Damn it, Jeremy hadn’t been able to get her out of the house. So now his time was really limited. Rhys forced himself to focus.  
  
  He looked across her dresser, scattered with car keys, jewelry, and other knickknacks. Nothing that stood out. Her rumpled bed was unmade, her tiny nightstand covered by a little lamp, a candle, and what looked like a fairly racy romance. Did that cover have a woman with more than one guy on the front?  
  
  As he reached for it, he heard Kelsey say, “Yes, I know you’ll reprimand me, sir. Whatever you feel is necessary, I understand.” She paused. “Good night.”  
  
  Then she slammed the phone in its cradle and began stomping down the hall, her footsteps echoing across the hardwood floors.  
  
  Hide! He hustled into the shadowed confines of her walk-in closet and scrambled behind her dresses along the back wall, praying she wouldn’t find him before he could get out. Otherwise, he’d have to have a good explanation for being here. Which he didn’t. And there would be hell to pay.  
  
  Kelsey entered her bedroom with a shaky sigh and darted straight for her nightstand. Through the crack in the door, he could see her wrench open a drawer. She withdrew a pair of rumpled paper bags and tore into them. As she extracted the items, Rhys clenched his fists to hold in his groan.  
  
  Her battery-operated rabbit and a slender, curved vibrator.  
  
  She was going to masturbate. Fuck!  
  
  Plopping her items on the bed, Kelsey tore off her cover-up, put her iPod buds in her ears, switched the MP3 player on, then lay down. Her skin looked so flawless and fair against the dark sheets. Her breathing picked up, lifting her chest with each inhalation, her hard nipples stabbing the air. Rhys got hard all over again. Yes, he loved watching her through her window, but to be mere feet away from her? Surely, he’d spontaneously combust.  
  
  Before moving next door to Kelsey, he’d preferred tall, skinny girls with straight hair and sun-kissed skin. One look at Kelsey and he’d barely looked at another woman. When he’d met her, heard her laugh, experienced her warmth, he’d been a goner.  
  
  She closed her eyes, took a deep breath. Time to call the others for a backup plan. It went against his grain to let the others in on her private moments, many of which he’d watched from his bedroom window, dick in hand . . . but he might not get out of Kelsey’s house undetected without their help. Damn it.  
  
  He hit Tucker’s speed dial. Not a second later, her friend picked up. “What did you find?”  
  
  “Hang on a second,” he whispered, not knowing how loud her iPod might be.",1,1756410090.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

  Jumping to your death was a crappy way to spend St. Patrick's Day. Being called in on your day off to talk someone out of jumping to his death on St. Patrick's Day wasn't exactly green beer and bagpipes. Phoebe weaved and dodged her way through the crowds of Savannahians and tourists thronging streets and sidewalks in celebration.  
  
  Captain David McVee thought ahead, she noted. Even with a badge, it would've taken precious time and miserable effort to get through the barricades and mobs of people in her car. But a couple blocks east of Jones, the revelry thinned, and the booming music was only a throb and echo.  
  
  The uniformed officer waited as ordered. His gaze skimmed over her face, down to the badge she'd hooked on the pocket of her khakis. Cropped pants, sandals, shamrock-green T-shirt under a linen jacket, Phoebe thought. Not the professional look she worked to foster on the job.  
  
  But what could you do? She was supposed to be standing on the terrace of MacNamara House, with her family, drinking lemonade and watching the parade.  
  
  ""Lieutenant MacNamara?""  
  
  ""That's right. Let's move. "" She slid in, flipping out her phone with one hand, dragging the seat belt on with the other. ""Captain, I'm en route. Fill me in. ""  
  
  The siren screamed as the driver punched the gas. Phoebe yanked out her notebook, taking cursory notes.  
  
  Joseph (Joe) Ryder, suicidal. Jumper with gun. Twenty-seven, white, married! separated. Bartender fired. No known religious affiliation. No family on scene. WHY? Wife left, fired from job (sports bar), gambling debts.  
  
  No criminal, no previous suicide attempt on record. Subject alternately weepy/belligerent. No shots fired.  
  
  ""Okay. "" Phoebe let out a breath. She'd get to know Joe much better very soon. ""Who's talking to him?""  
  
  ""He's got his cell phone on him. The first on scene wasn't able to engage. Guy just kept clicking off. We've got his employer here-former employer, who's also his landlord. The subject's been talking to him off and on, but there's no progress. ""  
  
  ""You?""  
  
  ""I'd barely gotten here when I pulled you in. I didn't want to throw too many people at him. ""  
  
  ""All right. My ETA's five minutes. "" She glanced at the driver, got a nod of affirmation. ""Keep him alive for me. ""  
  
  Inside Joe Ryder's fourth-floor apartment, sweat rolled down Duncan Swift's back. A guy he knew, a guy he'd had beers with, joked with, had pissed with, for God's sake, in adjoining urinals, was sitting on the ledge of the roof overhead with a gun in his hand.  
  
  Because I fired him, Duncan thought. Because I gave him thirty days to get out of the apartment. Because I didn't pay attention. Now, it was a very strong possibility that Joe was going to put a bullet in his own ear or take a header off the roof. Maybe both.  
  
  Not exactly the kind of entertainment the crowds expected on St. Patrick's Day. Not that it was keeping them away. The cops had barri caded the block, but from the window Duncan could see people pressed against the barriers, faces turned up.  
  
  He wondered if Joe was wearing green.  
  
  ""Come on, Joe, we'll work it out. "" How many times, Duncan asked himself, would he have to repeat that same phrase the cop kept circling in his notebook. ""Just put the gun down and come inside. ""  
  
  ""You fucking fired me!""  
  
  ""Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Joe, I was pissed off. "" You stole from me, you stupid dick, Duncan thought. You screwed up, stole from me. You took a damn swing at me. ""I didn't realize how upset you were, or what was going on. You come inside and we'll work it out. ""  
  
  ""You know Lori left me. ""  
  
  "" I. . . "" No, not I, Duncan remembered. His head was pulsing with the mother of all headaches, but he struggled to remember the instructions Captain McVee had given him. ""You must've been feeling upset. ""  
  
  Joe's answer was to start sobbing again. ""Just keep him talking,"" Dave murmured.  
  
  Duncan listened to Joe's sobbing complaints, tried to repeat key phrases as he'd been directed.  
  
  The redhead shot into the room like a sleek bullet. She shrugged out of a light jacket while she talked to the captain, then shrugged into a bulletproof vest. All her movements lightning quick.  
  
  Duncan couldn't hear what they were saying. And he couldn't take his eyes off her.  
  
  Purpose was the first term that came to his mind. Then energy.  
  
  Then sexy, though the third was mixed into the first two in equal portions. She shook her head, looked toward Duncan -long, cool stare with cat-green eyes.  
  
  ""It's got to be face-to-face, Captain. You knew that when you pulled me in. ""  
  
  ""You can try to bring him in via the phone first. ""  
  
  ""Been tried. "" She studied the man currently making soothing noises over the subject's weeping. Former employer and landlord, she deduced. Young for it, she mused. Very cute guy who looked as if he was trying hard not to panic.  
  
  ""He needs a face. He needs personal contact. Is that the employer?""  
  
  ""Duncan Swift, owns the bar street level of the building. He called the nine-one-one after the subject contacted him and said he was going off the roof. He's-Swift's-been on scene since. ""  
  
  ""All right. You're the commander on this one, but I'm the negotiator. I need to go up. Let's see how the subject feels about that. ""  
  
  She walked over to Duncan, gestured for him to pass her the phone. ""Joe? This is Phoebe. I'm with the police department. How you doing out there, Joe?""  
  
  ""Why?""  
  
  ""I want to make sure you're okay. You hot out there, Joe? Sun's pretty strong today. I'm going to ask Duncan to get us a couple bottles of cold water. I'd like to bring them up, talk to you up there. ""  
  
  ""I've got a gun!""  
  
  ""I hear that. If I come up with a cold drink for you, are you going to shoot me, Joe?""  
  
  ""No,"" he said after a long moment. ""No, shit. Why would I do that? I don't even know you. ""  
  
  ""I'll bring you out a bottle of water. Just me, Joe. I want you to promise you won't jump or fire that gun now. Will you promise to let me come on out, bring you a bottle of water?""  
  
  ""Rather have a beer. ""  
  
  The wistful tone in his voice gave her a little edge. ""What kind of beer would you like?""  
  
  ""Got Harp in the bottle in the fridge. ""  
  
  ""One cold beer coming up. "" She walked to the refrigerator, found there was little else but beer. Even as she took one out, Duncan moved beside her to open it. She nodded, pulled out the single Coke, popped the top. ""I'm coming on up with the beer, all right?""  
  
  ""Yeah, a beer'd be good. ""  
  
  ""Joe?"" Her voice was as cool as the bottles in her hand as one of the cops fitted her with a wire, removed her weapon. ""Are you going to commit suicide?""  
  
  ""That's the plan. ""  
  
  ""Well now, if that's your plan, I don't know as it's a good one. ""  
  
  She followed one of the uniforms out of the apartment, then up the stairs to the roof.  
  
  ""Got nothing better to do. ""  
  
  ""Nothing better? You sound like you're feeling pretty low. I'm at the roof door now, Joe. Is it all right if I come on out?""  
  
  ""Yeah, yeah, I said so, didn't I?""  
  
  She'd been right about the sun. It was strong enough to bounce off the roof like a hot red ball. She looked to her immediate left, and saw him.  
  
  He was wearing nothing but what looked like black boxers. Sandyhaired guy with fair skin-and that skin had already turned a painfully bright pink. He squinted at her out of eyes swollen from crying. ""I guess I should've brought out some sunscreen along with the beer. "" She held the bottle up so he could see it. ""You're getting toasted out here, Joe. ""  
  
  ""Don't matter. ""  
  
  ""I'd sure appreciate it if you'd put that gun down, Joe, so I could bring you your beer. ""  
  
  He shook his head. ""You might try something. ""  
  
  ""I promise no  
t to try anything if you put the gun down while I bring you the beer. All I want to do is talk, Joe, you and me. Talking's thirsty work out here in the sun. ""  
  
  With his feet dangling over the roof ledge, he lowered the gun, laid it in his lap. ""Just put it down there, then step back. ""  
  
  ""All right. "" She kept her eyes on his as she walked over. She could smell him, sweat and despair; she could see the misery in his bloodshot brown eyes. She set the bottle down carefully on the ledge, stepped back. ""Okay?""  
  
  ""You try anything, I'm going off. ""  
  
  ""I understand. What happened to make you feel so low?""  
  
  He picked up the beer and, closing his hand over the gun again, took a long pull. ""Why'd they send you out here?""  
  
  ""They didn't send me, I came. It's what I do. ""  
  
  ""What? You a shrink or something?"" He snorted on the idea, drank again.  
  
  ""Not exactly. I talk to people, especially people in trouble, or who think they are. What happened to make you think you're in trouble, Joe?""  
  
  ""I'm a fuck-up, that's all. ""  
  
  ""What makes you think you're a fuck-up?""  
  
  ""Wife walked out on me. We hadn't even been married six months and she walks. She told me she would, over and over. If I started betting again, she was out the door. I didn't listen; I didn't believe her. ""  
  
  ""It sounds like that makes you feel awful sad. ""  
  
  ""Best thing in my life, and I screw it up. I thought I could scorejust a couple of good scores and that would be it. Didn't work out. "" He shrugged. ""Never does. ""  
  
  ""It's not enough to die for, Joe. It's hard, and it's painful when someone you love walks away. But dying means you can't ever make it right. What's your wife's name?""  
  
  ""Lori,"" he mumbled as tears filled his eyes again.  
  
  ""I don't think you want to hurt Lori. How do you think she'll feel if you do this?"".  
  
  ""Why should she care?""  
  
  ""She cared enough to marry you. Do you mind if I sit here?"" She tapped the ledge a few feet away from him. When he shrugged, she eased a hip onto it, sipped her drink. ""I think we can figure this out, Joe. Figure out how to get you help, how to get you and Lori help. You sound like you want to find a way to fix things. ""  
  
  ""Lost my job. ""  
  
  ""That's hard. What kind of work did you do?""  
  
  ""Tending bar. Sports bar down below. Lori, she didn't want me to work in a sports bar, but I told her I could handle it. But I didn't. Couldn't. Started making bets on the side. And when I started losing, I shorted the till so Lori wouldn't find out. Bet more, lose more, steal more. Got caught, got fired. Behind on the rent, too. ""  
  
  He picked up the gun, turned it in his hand. Phoebe braced, and fought back the instinct to duck and cover. ""What's the point? I got nothing. ""  
  
  ""I understand how you might feel that way right now. But the fact is, Joe, there are plenty of chances left. Everybody deserves more than one of them. If you kill yourself, it's just done. It's just over all the way. No coming back, no making it up to Lori, or to yourself. How would you make it up to her if you got the chance?""  
  
  ""I don't know. "" He looked out over the city. ""I can hear music. Must be from the parade. ""  
  
  ""There's something to live for. What kind of music do you like?""  
  
  Inside the apartment, Duncan turned to Dave. ""Music? What kind of music does he like? What the hell is she doing?""  
  
  ""Keeping him talking. She's talking him down. He's telling her. ""  
  
  Dave nodded toward the speaker. ""As long as he's talking about Coldplay he's not going off the roof. ""  
  
  Duncan listened as they talked music for the next ten minutes, a conversation he might've heard in any bar or restaurant in the city. When he pictured Joe on the roof, it seemed surreal. When he pictured the redhead with her cat eyes and tight little body holding what smacked of small talk with a mostly naked, armed, suicidal bartender, it seemed impossible.  
  
  ""Do you think I should call Lori?"" Joe asked wistfully.  
  
  ""Is that what you want to do?"" She already knew they'd tried to reach Joe's estranged wife, without success.  
  
  ""I want to tell her I'm sorry. ""  
  
  ""That's good, telling her you're sorry. But you know what works better with women-and I know as I am one. Showing her. We believe it when you show us. You can show me right now if you give me the gun. ""  
  
  ""I figured on shooting myself before I jumped. Or maybe on the way down. ""  
  
  ""Look at me, Joe. "" When he turned his head, she kept her eyes straight on his. ""Is that how you're going to show her you're sorry? By making it so she has to bury you, so she has to grieve? Are you punishing her?""  
  
  ""No!"" His face, his voice, registered shock at the idea. ""It's my fault. It's all my fault. ""  
  
  ""All your fault? I never believe anything is all one person's fault. But let's fix it. Let's find the way you can make it up to her. ""  
  
  ""Phoebe, I owe almost five thousand gambling. ""  
  
  ""Five thousand's hard. It sounds like it scares you to owe that much. I understand what it is to have money problems hanging over your head. Do you want Lori to have to pay your debt?""  
  
  ""No. If I'm dead, nobody pays. ""  
  
  ""Nobody? But she's your wife. She's your legal wife. "" Phoebe doubted there was any legal liability, but she could see the idea of it strike Joe. ""She could be responsible for your debts. ""  
  
  ""God. Oh God. ""  
  
  ""I think I know how to help you with this, Joe. Joe? You know your boss is inside. He's inside there because he's worried about you. ""  
  
  ""He's okay. Dune's a good guy. I screwed him. Stole from him. I don't blame him for firing me. ""  
  
  ""I hear you say that, and know you understand you're responsible for your mistakes. You're a responsible person, and you want to fix those mistakes. Dune's a good guy, you tell me, then I'm going to believe he understands that, too. I'll talk to him for you if you want. I'm good at talking. If he'll give you an extension on paying back the money, that would help, wouldn't it?""  
  
  ""I. . . I don't know. ""  
  
  ""I'll talk to him for you. ""  
  
  ""He's a nice guy. I stole from him. ""  
  
  ""You were feeling desperate and scared, and you made a mistake. I sense you're sorry for that. ""  
  
  ""I am sorry. ""  
  
  ""I'll talk to him for you,"" she repeated. ""You need to give me the gun, and come back off the ledge. You don't want to hurt Lori. ""  
  
  ""I don't, but-""  
  
  ""If you could talk to Lori right now, what would you say?""  
  
  "" I. . . I guess that I don't know how it got this far, and I'm sorry. I love her. I don't want to lose her. ""  
  
  ""If you don't want to lose her, if you love her, you have to give me the gun and come back off the ledge. Otherwise, Joe, all you're leaving her with is grief and blame. ""  
  
  ""It's not her fault. ""  
  
  Phoebe eased off the ledge, held out a hand. ""You're right, Joe. You're absolutely right. Now, show her. ""  
  
  He stared at the gun, stared as Phoebe slowly reached out to take it.  
  
  It was slippery with his sweat as she flipped on the safety, secured it in her belt. ""Come on off the ledge, Joe. ""  
  
  ""What's going to happen?""  
  
  ""Come on off the ledge and I'll explain it. I won't lie to you. "" Once again, she offered her hand. Shouldn't, she knew. Negotiators could be pulled off by a jumper. But she kept her eyes on his, then clasped her fingers tight on his hand.  
  
  When his feet touched the roof, he simply slid down to the floor to sob again. She went with him, draped her arm around him, and shook her head fiercely at the cops who came through the door.  
  
  ""It's going to be all right. Joe, you're going to have to go with the police. You're going to need to have an evaluation. But it's going to be all right. ""  
  
  ""I'm sorry. ""  
  
  ""I know you are. Now you come on with me. Come on with me now. "" She helped him up, took his weight as they walked to the door. ""Let's get you some clothes on. No cuffs,"" she snapped. ""Joe, one of the officers is going to go get you a shirt, some pants, shoes. I  
s that all right?""  
  
  When he nodded, she gestured one of the officers toward the bedroom. ""Am I going to jail?""  
  
  ""For a little while. But we're going to get started on that help right away. ""  
  
  ""Will you call Lori? If she'd come I could. . . I could show her I'm sorry. ""  
  
  ""I sure will. I want that sunburn treated, and he needs some water in him. ""  
  
  Joe kept his eyes downcast as he pulled on jeans. ""Sorry, man,"" he mumbled to Duncan.  
  
  ""Don't worry about it. Listen, I'll get you a lawyer. "" Duncan looked blankly at Phoebe. ""Should I?""  
  
  ""That would be between you and Joe. You hang in there. "" She gave Joe's arm a light squeeze.  
  
  He was led out, a cop on either arm. ""Nice job, Lieutenant. ""  
  
  Phoebe pulled out the gun, opened it. ""One bullet. He was never going to shoot anyone but himself, and the odds are fifty-fifty he'd have done that. "" She handed the gun to her captain. ""You figured he needed to talk to a woman. ""  
  
  ""It leaned that way for me,"" Dave agreed.  
  
  ""All in all, looks like you were right. Somebody needs to track down his wife. I'll talk to her if she balks at seeing him. "" She swiped at her sweaty brow. ""Is there any water in this place?""  
  
  Duncan held out a bottle. ""I had some brought up. ""  
  
  ""Appreciate it. "" She drank deep as she studied him. Rich, dense brown hair, tousled around an angular face with a good, strong mouth and soft blue eyes that were currently pinched with worry. ""Are you pressing charges?""  
  
  ""For what?""  
  
  ""For what he nipped out of the till. ""  
  
  ""No. "" Duncan lowered himself to the arm of a chair. Closed his eyes. ""Christ, no. ""  
  
  ""How much was it?""  
  
  ""A couple thousand, a little more, I guess. It doesn't matter. ""  
  
  ""It does. He needs to pay it back, for his own self-respect. If you want to help him, you'll work that out. ""  
  
  ""Sure. Fine. ""  
  
  ""You're the landlord, too?""  
  
  ""Yeah. Sort of. ""  
  
  Phoebe lifted her brows. ""Aren't you the busy one? Can you manage to float the rent another month?""  
  
  ""Yeah, yeah, yeah. ""  
  
  ""Good. ""  
  
  ""Look. . . all I got was Phoebe. ""  
  
  ""MacNamara. Lieutenant MacNamara. ""  
  
  ""I like Joe. I don't want him to go to jail. ""  
  
  A good guy, Joe had said. He'd likely been right on that one. ""I appreciate that, but there are consequences. Paying them will help him.  
  
  He was crying for help, and now he'll get it. If you know where he owes the five thousand, he needs to make that right, too. ""  
  
  ""I didn't know he was gambling. ""  
  
  This time she let out a short laugh. ""You own a sports bar, but don't know there's gambling going on in it?""  
  
  His back went up. His gut was already in knots, and now his back went up. ""Hey, listen, Slam Dune's a friendly place, not a mob den. I didn't know he had a problem, or he wouldn't have been working the stick there. Some of this was my fault, but-""  
  
  ""No. No. "" She held up a hand, rubbed the cold bottle over her damp forehead. ""I'm hot, I'm irritable. And none of this was your fault. I apologize. Circumstances put him out there on that ledge, and he's responsible for those circumstances and the choices he made. Do you know where to find his wife?""  
  
  ""I expect she's at the parade like everyone else in Savannah, except us. ""  
  
  ""Do you know where she's living?""  
  
  ""Not exactly, but I gave your captain a couple numbers. Friends of theirs. ""  
  
  ""We'll find her. Are you going to be all right now?""  
  
  ""Well, I'm not going to go up on the roof and jump. "" He let out a long sigh, shook his head. ""Can I buy you a drink, Phoebe?""  
  
  She held up the bottle of water. ""You already did. ""  
  
  ""I could do better. ""  
  
  Hmm, a quick flicker of charm now, she noted. ""This'll be fine. You should go on home, Mr. Swift. ""  
  
  "" Duncan. ""  
  
  ""Mmm-hmm. "" She gave him a fleeting smile, then picked up her discarded jacket.  
  
  ""Hey, Phoebe. "" He made a bead for the door when she walked out. ""Can I call you if I feel suicidal?""  
  
  ""Try the hotline,"" she called back without looking around. ""Odds are they'll talk you down. ""  
  
  He moved to the rail to look down at her. Purpose, he thought again. He could acquire a strong taste for a woman with purpose.  
  
  Then he sat on the step, pulled out his phone. He called his closest friend-who was also his lawyer-to sweet-talk him into representing a suicidal bartender with a gambling addiction.  
  
  From the second-floor balcony, Phoebe watched the green sheepdog prance. He seemed pretty damn proud of himself, matching his steps to the fife and drum played by a trio of leprechauns.  
  
  Joe was alive, and while she'd missed the curtain, she was right where she wanted to be for the second act.  
  
  Not such a crappy way to spend St. Patrick's Day after all.  
  
  Beside her, Phoebe's seven-year-old daughter bounced in her bright green sneakers. Carly had campaigned long and hard for those shoes, Phoebe recalled, whittling away at any and all resistance to the price or impracticality.  
  
  She wore them with green cropped pants with tiny dark pink dots, and a green shirt with pink piping-also a long and arduous campaign by the pint-sized fashion diva. But Phoebe had to admit, the kid looked unbelievably sweet.  
  
  Carly's sunset red hair came down from her grandmother, through her mother. The curls came from her grandmother, too-skipping a generation there, as Phoebe's was straight as a stick. The brilliant and bright blue eyes were from Essie as well. The middle generation, as Phoebe often thought of herself, settled for green.  
  
  All three had the pale, pale redhead's complexion, but Carly had inherited the dimples Phoebe had longed for as a child, and the pretty mouth with its dip deep in the top lip.  
  
  There were times Phoebe looked at her mother and her daughter, and through the impossible waves of love wondered how she could be the bridge between two such perfectly matched points.  
  
  Phoebe brushed a hand over Carly's shoulder, then bent to press a kiss on those wild red curls. In answer to the gesture, Carly shot out a mile-wide grin that showed the gap of two missing front teeth.  
  
  ""Best seat in the house. "" From behind them, one short stride outside the door, Essie beamed.  
  
  ""Did you see the dog, Gran?""  
  
  ""I sure did. ""  
  
  Phoebe's brother turned to their mother. ""You want a seat, Mama?""  
  
  ""No, sweetie. "" Essie waved Carter off. ""I'm just fine. ""  
  
  ""You can come up to the rail again, Gran. I'll hold your hand the whole time. It's just like the courtyard. ""  
  
  ""That's right. That's right. "" But Essie's smile was strained as she crossed the short distance to the rail.  
  
  ""You can see better from here,"" Carly began. ""Here comes another marching band! Isn't it great, Gran? Look how high they're stepping. "" See how she soothes her Gran, Phoebe thought. How her little hand holds tight to give support. And Carter, look at him, moving to Mama's other side, running a hand down her back even as he points to the crowd.  
  
  Phoebe knew what her mother saw when she looked at Carter. Having a child of her own, she understood exactly that hard and stunning love. But it would be doubled for her, Phoebe thought. Mama had only to look at Carter, at the rich brown hair, those warm hazel eyes, the shape of his chin, his nose, his mouth, and she would see the husband she'd lost so young. And all the might-have-beens that died with him. ""Fresh lemonade!"" Ava wheeled a cart to the doorway. ""With plenty of mint so we've got the green. ""  
  
  ""Ava, you didn't have to go to all that trouble. ""  
  
  ""I certainly did. "" Ava laughed at Phoebe and flipped back her sassy swing of blond hair. At forty-three, Ava Vestry Dover remained the most beautiful woman of Phoebe's acquaintance. And perhaps the kindest. When Ava lifted the pitcher, Phoebe hurried over. ""No, I'll pour and serve. You go on and watch awhile. Mama'll feel better with you standing with her,"" Phoebe added quietly.  
  
  
  With a nod, Ava walked over, touched Essie on the shoulder, then moved to stand on Carly's other side.  
  
  There was her family, Phoebe thought. True, Ava's son was off in New York in college, and Carter's pretty wife was working, but this was the foundation, the bedrock. Without them, she wasn't sure she wouldn't just float off like a dust mote.  
  
  She poured lemonade, passed around the glasses, then stood beside Carter. Leaned her head on his shoulder. ""I'm sorry Josie can't be here. ""  
  
  ""Me, too. She'll be here for dinner if she can. ""  
  
  Her baby brother, she thought, a married man. ""You two ought to stay the night, avoid the holiday traffic and the insanity of revelry. ""  
  
  ""We like the insanity of revelry, but I'll see if she'd rather. Remember the first time we stood up here and watched the parade? That first spring after Reuben. ""  
  
  ""I remember. ""  
  
  ""Everything was so bright and loud and foolish. Everyone was so happy. I believe even Cousin Bess cracked a smile or two. "" Probably just indigestion, Phoebe thought, with lingering bitterness. ""I felt, really felt, maybe everything would be all right. That he wasn't going to break out and come for us, wasn't going to kill us in our sleep. Christmas didn't do that for me, not that first year, or my birthday. But standing here all those years ago, I thought maybe everything was going to be all right after all. ""  
  
  ""And it was. ""  
  
  She took his hand so they were linked, right down the line of the rail.  
Chapter 2  
  
  Cleaned up and hung over, Duncan sat at his kitchen counter brooding over his laptop and a cup of black coffee. He'd meant to keep it to a couple of beers, hanging with some of the regulars at Slam Dunc before heading off to catch the music, another beer or two at Swifty's, his Irish pub.  
  
  When you owned bars, he'd learned, you were smart to stay sober.  
  
  He might bend that rule of thumb a little on St. Patrick's Day or New Year's Eve. But he knew how to coast through a long night with a couple of beers.  
  
  It hadn't been celebration that put the Jameson's with a bump of Harp back into his hand too many times. It had been sheer relief. Joe wasn't a smear on the sidewalk outside the bar.  
  
  I'll drink to that.  
  
  And it was better to be hungover due to good news than hungover due to bad. You still felt like shit, Duncan admitted as the horns and pipes throbbed in his abused head, but you knew it would wear off.  
  
  What he needed to do was get out of the house. Take a walk. Or a nap in the hammock. Then figure out what to do next. He'd been figuring out what to do next for the past seven years. And he liked it.  
  
  He frowned at the laptop another moment, then shook his head. If he tried to work now, even pretend to work, his head would probably explode.  
  
  Instead, he carried his coffee out to the back veranda. The mourning doves were cooing, bobbing heads as they pecked along the ground under the bird feeder. Too fat and lazy, Duncan thought, to bother to fly up into it. Rather take leavings. A lot of people were the same.  
  
  His gardens were thriving, and he liked knowing he'd put a little of his own sweat and effort into them. He considered walking through them now, winding his way under the live oaks and the thick spiderwebs of moss to the dock. Take a sail maybe, cruise the river.  
  
  Damn pretty morning for it, if you paid attention. One of those sparkling clear, hint-of-a-breeze mornings you'd wish you'd prized come July.  
  
  Or he could just go down and sit on the dock, look out toward the salt flats and watch the sun play on them. Take the coffee down and just sit and do nothing on a pretty spring morning-a damn good deal.  
  
  And what was Joe doing this fine morning? Sitting in a cell? A padded room? What was the redhead up to?  
  
  It was no use pretending it was just an ordinary day in the life when he couldn't get yesterday out of his head. No point thinking he wanted to sit on the pier nursing a hangover and pretending everything was just fine and dandy.  
  
  So he went up the back steps to his bedroom, hunted out clean jeans and a shirt that didn't look like it had been slept in. Then he pulled his wallet, keys and other pocket paraphernalia out of the jeans he had slept in after he'd dragged his half-drunken ass to bed.  
  
  At least he'd been smart enough to take a cab, he reminded himself as he scooped his fingers through his shaggy mass of brown hair. Maybe he should wear a suit. Should he wear a suit?  
  
  Shit.  
  
  He decided a suit was a kind of showing off when worn to visit a for mer employee in Joe's current situation. Besides, he didn't feel like wearing a damn suit.  
  
  Still, the redhead might like suits, and since he had every intention of tracking her down, a suit could play to his advantage.  
  
  Hell with it.  
  
  He started out, jogged down the sweeping curve of the main staircase, across the polished sea of white tiles of the grand foyer. When he opened one of the arching double doors, he saw the little red Jag zip down the last curve of his drive.  
  
  The man who folded himself out of it was wearing a suit, and it was sure to be Italian-as would be the shoes. Phineas T. Hector could manage to look perfectly groomed after mud wrestling in a hurricane.  
  
  Duncan hooked his thumbs in his front pockets and watched Phin stroll. He never looked to be in any particular hurry, Duncan mused, but that mind of his was always running on high speed.  
  
  He looked like a lawyer, Duncan supposed, and a high-dollar one. Which was exactly what he was now. When they'd first met-had it been ten years now?-Phin had barely been able to afford the cab fare to court, much less an Armani suit.  
  
  Now he wore it like he'd been born to, the pale gray an excellent choice against his dark skin, his gym-hammered body. Sun flashed off his dark glasses as he paused at the base of the white steps to study Duncan.

1n2m1yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/oggyandthecockroaches/comments/1n2m1yg/i_love_how_the_portray_olivia/,I love how the portray Olivia,"I really love how they portray Olivia in Oggy & The Cockroaches. She isn’t just there to be a pretty eye-candy for the male characters to swoon over, but rather a character with a personality of her own. She isn’t perfect, and goes through difficult situations just like the male characters. The cockroaches mess with her the same way they mess with Oggy and Jack. And she isn't sexualized (before you try to tell me she's a cat, I'd like to remind you of those female cats Tom and that alley cat would fight over in Tom & Jerry). 

What makes her stand out though is that she takes charge. Whenever she sees a problem, she steps up and leads the team towards a solution. For example: in one episode, Oggy, Jack, and Bob get turned into babies by an angry witch. Olivia literally comes forward to become their parent. She struggles to take care of three very chaotic kids but never quits on them, before finally travelling to the witch and convincing her to undo the curse. In this episode, she's shown as a very tired single mum with eye bags from exhaustion. They didn't even try to make her look pretty when she was having her morning coffee half-asleep. That was so real! 
In another episode, the three male characters struggle with lice and she takes charge again to fix the problem. She stops them from fighting among themselves and finds a solution to the issue. 

We see again and again in these episodes that she's a smart, independent character with leadership skills, not just Oggy's gf. And when she steps up, they all respect her, even the cockroaches. In my observation, Olivia actually commands respect with her don't-mess-with-me personality. 

I'm aware these are a lot of words my grown ass is writing over a kids’ show. But I can’t help but admire how they gave her an actual strong personality, a life that doesn’t revolve around male characters, and the freedom to be just as silly and messy as the boys. That’s something I rarely saw in cartoons growing up, and I love it! They did something similar with Monica too in my opinion. Speaking of whom, I love the seemingly sisterly bond between her and Olivia.

  THE RITE BEGAN an hour after sunset. The circle had been prepared long ago, a perfect nine feet, by the clearing of trees and young saplings. The ground had been sprinkled with consecrated earth.  
  
  Clouds, dark and secretive, danced over the pale moon.  
  
  Thirteen figures, in black cowls and cloaks, stood inside the protective circle. In the woods beyond, a lone owl began to scream, in lament or in sympathy. When the gong sounded, even he was silenced. For a moment, there was only the murmur of the wind through the early spring leaves.  
  
  In the pit at the left side of the circle, the fire already smoldered. Soon the flames would rise up, called by that same wind or other forces.  
  
  It was May Day Eve, the Sabbat of Roodmas. On this night of high spring, both celebration and sacrifice would be given for the fertility of crops and for the power of men.  
  
  Two women dressed in red robes stepped into the circle. Their faces were not hooded and were very white, with a slash of scarlet over their lips. Like vampires who had already feasted.  
  
  One, following the careful instructions she had been given, shed her robe and stood naked in the light of a dozen black candles, then draped herself over a raised slab of polished wood.  
  
  She would be their altar of living flesh, the virgin on which they would worship. The fact that she was a prostitute and far from pure disturbed some of them. Others simply relished her lush curves and generously spread thighs.  
  
  The high priest, having donned his mask of the Goat of Mendes, began to chant in bastardized Latin. When he had finished his recitation, he raised his arms high toward the inverted pentagram above the altar. A bell was rung to purify the air.  
  
  From her hiding place in the brush, a young girl watched, her eyes wide with curiosity. There was a burning smell coming from the pit where flames crackled, sending sparks shooting high. Odd shapes had been carved in the trunks of the circling trees.  
  
  The young girl began wondering where her father was. She had hidden in his car, giggling to herself at the trick she was playing on him. When she had followed him through the woods, she hadn't been afraid of the dark. She'd never been afraid. She had hidden, waiting for the right time to jump out and into his arms.  
  
  But he had put on a long, dark coat, like the others, and now she wasn't sure which one was Daddy. Though the naked woman both embarrassed and fascinated her, what the grown-ups were doing no longer seemed like a game.  
  
  She felt her heart beating in her throat when the man in the mask began to chant again.  
  
  “We call on Ammon, the god of life and reproduction. On Pan, the god of lust.”  
  
  After the calling of each name, the others repeated it. The list was long.  
  
  The group was swaying now, a deep hum rising up among them while the high priest drank from a silver chalice. Finished, he set the cup down between the breasts of the altar.  
  
  He took up a sword and pointing it south, east, north, and west, called up the four princes of hell.  
  
  Satan, lord of fire  
  
  Lucifer, bringer of light  
  
  Belial, who has no master  
  
  Leviathan, serpent of the deep  
  
  In the brush, the young girl shuddered and was afraid. “Ave, Satan.”  
  
  “I call upon you, Master, Prince of Darkness, King of the Night, throw wide the Gates of Hell and hear us.” The high priest shouted the words, not like a prayer, but a demand. As his voice rang out, he held up a parchment. The lights from the greedy flames washed through it like blood. “We ask that our crops be bountiful, our cattle fruitful. Destroy our enemies, bring sickness and pain to those who would harm us. We, your faithful, demand fortune and pleasure.” He placed a hand on the breast of the altar. “We take what we wish, in Your name, Lord of the Flies. In Your name, we speak: Death to the weak. Wealth to the strong. The rods of our sex grow hard, our blood hot. Let our women burn for us. Let them receive us lustfully.” He stroked down the altar's torso and between the thighs as the prostitute, well-schooled, moaned and began to move under his hand.  
  
  His voice rose as he continued his requests. He thrust the sword's point through the parchment and held it over the flame of a black candle until all that remained of it was the stink of smoke. The chant of the circle of twelve swelled behind him.  
  
  At some signal, two of the cloaked figures pulled a young goat into the circle. As its eyes rolled in fright, they chanted over it, nearly screaming now. The athamas was drawn, the ceremonial knife whose freshly whetted blade glimmered under the rising moon.  
  
  When the girl saw the blade slice across the white goat's throat, she tried to scream, but no sound passed her lips. She wanted to run, but her legs seemed rooted to the ground. She covered her face with her hands, weeping and wanting to call for her father.  
  
  When at last she looked again, the ground ran with blood. It dripped over the sides of a shallow silver bowl. The voices of the men were a roaring buzz in her ears as she watched them throw the headless carcass of the goat into the fire pit.  
  
  Now the stink of roasting flesh hung sickeningly in the air.  
  
  With a ululant cry, the man in the goat mask tore off his cloak. Beneath he was naked, his white, white skin glimmering with sweat, though the night was cool. Glinting on his chest was a silver amulet inscribed with old and secret symbols.  
  
  He straddled the altar, then drove himself hard between her thighs. With a howling scream, a second man fell on the other woman, dragging her to the ground, while the others tore off their cloaks to dance naked around the pit of fire.  
  
  She saw her father, her own father, dip his hands into the sacrificial blood. As he capered with the others, it dripped from his fingers….  
  
  Clare woke, screaming.  
  
  Breathless, chilled with sweat, she huddled under the blankets. With one trembling hand, she fumbled for the switch on the bedside lamp. When that wasn't enough, she rose to flip on others until the small room was flooded with light. Her hands were still unsteady when she drew a cigarette from a pack and struck a match.  
  
  Sitting on the edge of the bed, she smoked in silence.  
  
  Why had the dream come back now?  
  
  Her therapist would say it was a knee-jerk reaction to her mother's recent marriage-subconsciously she felt her father had been betrayed.  
  
  That was bull.  
  
  Clare blew out a defiant stream of smoke. Her mother had been widowed for over twelve years. Any sane, loving daughter would want her mother's happiness. And she was a loving daughter. She just wasn't so sure about the sane part.  
  
  She remembered the first time she'd had the dream. She'd been six and had wakened screaming in her bed. Just as she had tonight. But then, her parents had rushed in to gather her up and soothe. Even her brother, Blair, had come in, wide-eyed and wailing. Her mother had carried him off while her father stayed with her, crooning in his calm, quiet voice, promising her over and over that it was only a dream, a bad dream that she would soon forget.  
  
  And she had, for long stretches of time. Then it would creep up on her, a grinning assassin, when she was tense or exhausted or vulnerable.  
  
  She stabbed out the cigarette and pressed her fingers to her eyes. Well, she was tense now. Her one-woman show was less than a week away, and though she had personally chosen each piece of sculpture that would be shown, she was plagued with doubts.  
  
  Perhaps it was because the critics had been so enthusiastic two years before, at her debut. Now that she was enjoying success, there was so much more to lose. And she knew the work that would be shown was her best. If it was found to be mediocre, then she, as an artist, was mediocre.  
  
\>   Was there any label more damning?  
  
  Because she felt better having something tangible to worry about, she rose and opened the draperies. The sun was just coming up, giving the streets and sidewalks of downtown Manhattan an almost rosy hue. Pushing open the window, she shivered once in the chill of the spring morning.  
  
  It was almost quiet. From a few blocks up, she could hear the grind of a garbage truck finishing its rounds. Near the corner of Canal and Greene, she saw a bag lady pulling a cart with all her worldly possessions. The wheels squeaked and echoed hollowly.  
  
  There was a light in the bakery directly across and three stories down. Clare caught the faint strains of Rigoletto and the good yeasty scent of baking bread. A cab rumbled past, valves knocking. Then there was silence again. She might have been alone in the city.  
  
  Was that what she wanted? she wondered. To be alone, to find some spot and dig into solitude? There were times when she felt so terribly disconnected, yet unable to make a place just for herself.  
  
  Wasn't that why her marriage had failed? She had loved Rob, but she had never felt connected to him. When it was over, she'd felt regret but not remorse.  
  
  Or perhaps Dr. Janowski was right, and she was burying her remorse, all of it, every ounce of grief she had felt since her father died. Channeling it out through her art.  
  
  And what was wrong with that? She started to stuff her hands into the pockets of her robe when she discovered she wasn't wearing it. A woman had to be crazy to stand in an open window in SoHo wearing nothing but a flimsy Bill the Cat T-shirt. The hell with it, she thought and leaned out farther. Maybe she was crazy.  
  
  She stood, her bright red hair disheveled from restless sleep, her face pale and tired, watching the light grow and listening to the noise begin as the city woke.  
  
  Then she turned away, ready for work.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  It was after two when Clare heard the buzzer. It sounded like an annoying bee over the hiss of the torch in her hand and the crash of Mozart booming from the stereo. She considered ignoring it, but the new piece wasn't going very well, and the interruption was a good excuse to stop. She turned off her torch. As she crossed her studio, she pulled off her safety gloves. Still wearing her goggles, skullcap, and apron, she flicked on the intercom. “Yes?”  
  
  “Clare? Angie.”  
  
  “Come on up.” Clare punched in the security code and released the elevator. After pulling off her cap and goggles, she walked back to circle the half-formed sculpture.  
  
  It stood on her welding table in the rear of the loft, surrounded by tools-pliers, hammers, chisels, extra torch tips. Her tanks of acetylene and oxygen rested in their sturdy steel cart. Beneath it all was a twenty-foot square of sheet metal, to keep sparks and hot drippings off the floor.  
  
  Most of the loft space was taken over by Clare's work-chunks of granite, slabs of cherrywood and ash, hunks and tubes of steel. Tools for hacking, prying, sanding, welding. She'd always enjoyed living with her work.  
  
  Now she approached her current project, eyes narrowed, lips pursed. It was holding out on her, she thought, and she didn't bother to look around when the doors of the elevator slid open.  
  
  “I should have known.” Angie LeBeau tossed back her mane of black, corkscrew curls and tapped one scarlet Italian pump on the hardwood floor. “I've been calling you for over an hour.”  
  
  “I turned off the bell. Machine's picking it up. What do you get from this, Angie?”  
  
  Blowing out a long breath, Angie studied the sculpture on the worktable. “Chaos.”  
  
  “Yeah.” With a nod, Clare stooped lower. “Yeah, you're right. I've been going at this the wrong way.”  
  
  “Don't you dare pick up that torch.” Tired of shouting, she stomped across the floor and switched off the stereo. “Damn it, Clare, we had a date for lunch at the Russian Tea Room at twelve-thirty.”  
  
  Clare straightened and focused on her friend for the first time. Angie was, as always, the picture of elegance. Her toffee-colored skin and exotic features were set off to perfection by the navy Adolfo suit and oversize pearls.  
  
  Her handbag and shoes were identical shades of scarlet leather. Angie liked everything to match, everything to be in its place. In her closet, her shoes were neatly stacked in clear plastic boxes. Her blouses were arranged by color and fabric. Her handbags-a legendary collection-were tucked into individual slots on custom-built shelves.  
  
  As for herself, Clare was lucky if she could find both shoes of a pair in the black hole of her closet. Her handbag collection consisted of one good black evening bag and a huge canvas tote. More than once Clare had wondered how she and Angie had ever become, and remained, friends.  
  
  Right at the moment, that friendship seemed to be on the line, she noted. Angie's dark eyes were hot, and her long scarlet fingernails were tapping on her bag in time with her foot.  
  
  “Stand just like that.” Clare bounded across the room to search through the confusion on the sofa for a sketch pad. She tossed aside a sweatshirt, a silk blouse, unopened mail, an empty bag of Fritos, a couple of paperback novels, and a plastic water pistol.  
  
  “Damn it, Clare-”  
  
  “No, don't move.” Pad in hand, she heaved a cushion aside and found a chalk pencil. “You're beautiful when you're angry.” Clare grinned.  
  
  “Bitch,” Angie said and struggled with a laugh.  
  
  “That's it, that's it.” Clare's pencil flew across the pad. “Christ, what cheekbones! Who would have thought if you mixed Cherokee, African, and French, you'd get such bone structure? Snarl a little bit, would you?”  
  
  “Put that stupid thing down. You're not going to flatter your way out of this. I sat in RTR for an hour drinking Perrier and gnawing on the tablecloth.”  
  
  “Sorry. I forgot.”  
  
  “What else is new?”  
  
  Clare set the sketch aside, knowing Angie would look at it the minute her back was turned. “Want some lunch?” “I had a hot dog in the cab.”  
  
  “Then I'll grab something, and you can tell me what we were supposed to talk about.”  
  
  “The show, you imbecile!” Angie eyed the sketch and smothered a smile. Clare had drawn her with flames shooting out of her ears. Refusing to be amused, she glanced around for a clear spot to sit and finally settled on the arm of the sofa. God knew what else lurked under the cushions. “Are you ever going to hire somebody to shovel this place out?”  
  
  “No, I like it this way.” Clare stepped into the kitchen, which was little more than an alcove in the corner of the studio. “It helps me create.”  
  
  “You can pull that artistic temperament crap on someone else, Clare. I happen to know you're just a lazy slob.”  
  
  “When you're right, you're right.” She came out again with a pint of Dutch chocolate ice cream and a tablespoon. “Want some?”  
  
  “No.” It was a constant irritation to Angie that Clare could binge on junk food whenever the whim struck, which was often, and never add flesh to her willowy figure.  
  
  At five ten, Clare wasn't the stick figure she had been during her childhood, but still slender enough that she didn't check the scale each morning as Angie did. Angie watched her now as Clare, wearing her leather apron over bib overalls, shoveled in calories. In all likelihood, Angie mused, she wore nothing under the denim but skin.  
  
  Clare wore no makeup, either. Pale gold freckles were dusted across her skin. Her eyes, a slightly darker shade of amber-gold, were huge in her triangular face with its soft, generous mouth and small, undistinguished nose. Despite Clare's unruly crop of fiery hair, just long enough to form a stubby ponytail when it was pulled back with a rubber band, and her exceptional height, there was an air of fragility about her that made Angie, at thirty only two years her senior, feel maternal.  
  
  “Girl, when are you going to learn to sit down and eat a meal?”  
  
  Clare grinned and dug for more ice cream. “Now you're worried about me, so I guess I'm forgiven.” She perched on a stool and tucked one booted foot under the rung. “I really am sorry about lunch.”  
  
  “You always ar  
e. What about writing notes to yourself?”  
  
  “I do write them, then I forget where I've put them.

With her dripping spoon, she gestured around the huge, disordered space. The sofa where Angie sat was one of the few pieces of furniture, though there was a table under a pile of newspapers, magazines, and empty soft drink bottles. Another stool was shoved into a corner and held a bust of black marble. Paintings crowded the walls, and pieces of sculpture-some finished, some abandoned-sat, stood, or reclined as space allowed.  
  
  Up a clunky set of wrought-iron steps was the storeroom she'd converted into a bedroom. But the rest of the enormous space she'd lived in for five years had been taken over by her art.  
  
  For the first eighteen years of her life, Clare had struggled to live up to her mother's standards of neatness and order. It had taken her less than three weeks on her own to accept that turmoil was her natural milieu.  
  
  She offered Angie a bland grin. “How am I supposed to find anything in this mess?”  
  
  “Sometimes I wonder how you remember to get out of bed in the morning.”  
  
  “You're just worried about the show.” Clare set the half-eaten carton of ice cream aside, where, Angie thought, it would probably melt. Clare picked up a pack of cigarettes and located a match. “Worrying about it is a lesson in futility. They're either going to like my stuff, or they're not.”  
  
  “Right. Then why do you look like you've gotten about four hours′ sleep?”  
  
  “Five,” Clare corrected, but she didn't want to bring up the dream. “I'm tense, but I'm not worried. Between you and your sexy husband, there's enough worrying going on already.”  
  
  “Jean-Paul's a wreck,” Angie admitted. Married to the gallery owner for two years, she was powerfully attracted by his intelligence, his passion for art, and his magnificent body. “This is the first major show in the new gallery. It's not just your butt on the line.”  
  
  “I know.” Clare's eyes clouded briefly as she thought of all the money and time and hope the LeBeaus had invested in their new, much larger gallery. “I'm not going to let you down.”  
  
  Angie saw that despite her claims, Clare was as scared as the rest of them. “We know that,” she said, deliberately lightening the mood. “In fact, we expect to be the gallery on the West Side after your show. In the meantime, I'm here to remind you that you've got a ten A.M. interview with New York magazine, and a lunch interview tomorrow with the Times.” “Oh, Angie.”  
  
  “No escape from it this time.” Angie uncrossed her shapely legs. “You'll see the New York writer in our penthouse. I shudder to think of holding an interview here.”  
  
  “You just want to keep an eye on me.”  
  
  “There is that. Lunch at Le Cirque, one sharp.”  
  
  “I wanted to go in and check on the setup at the gallery.”  
  
  “There's time for that, too. I'll be here at nine to make sure you're up and dressed.”  
  
  “I hate interviews,” Clare mumbled.  
  
  “Tough.” Angie took her by the shoulders and kissed both her cheeks. “Now go get some rest. You really do look tired.”  
  
  Clare perched an elbow on her knee. “Aren't you going to lay out my clothes for me?” she asked as Angie walked to the elevator.  
  
  “It may come to that.”  
  
  Alone, Clare sat brooding for a few minutes. She did detest interviews, all the pompous and personal questions. The process of being studied, measured, and dissected. As with most things she disliked but couldn't avoid, she pushed it out of her mind.  
  
  She was tired, too tired to concentrate well enough to fire up her torch again. In any case, nothing she'd begun in the past few weeks had turned out well. But she was much too restless to nap or to stretch out on the floor and devour some daytime television.  
  
  On impulse she rose and went to a large trunk that served as seat, table, and catch-all. Digging in, she riffled through an old prom dress, her graduation cap, her wedding veil, which aroused a trio of reactions-surprise, amusement, and regret-a pair of tennis shoes she'd thought were lost for good, and at last, a photo album.  
  
  She was lonely, Clare admitted as she took it with her to the window seat overlooking Canal Street. For her family. If they were all too far away to touch, at least she could reach them through old pictures.  
  
  The first snapshot made her smile. It was a muddy black-and-white Polaroid of herself and her twin brother, Blair, as infants. Blair and Clare, she thought with a sigh. How often had she and her twin groaned over their parents′ decision to name cute? The shot was fuzzily out of focus, her father's handiwork. He'd never taken a clear picture in his life.  
  
  “I'm mechanically declined,” he'd always said. “Put anything with a button or a gear in my hands, and I'll mess it up. But give me a handful of seeds and some dirt, and I'll grow you the biggest flowers in the county.”  
  
  And it was true, Clare thought. Her mother was a natural tinkerer, fixing toasters and unstopping sinks, while Jack Kimball had wielded hoe and spade and clippers to turn their yard on the corner of Oak Leaf and Mountain View Lanes in Emmitsboro, Maryland, into a showplace.  
  
  There was proof here, in a picture her mother had taken. It was perfectly centered and in focus. The infant Kimball twins reclined on a blanket on close-cropped green grass. Behind them was a lush bank of spring blooms. Nodding columbine, bleeding hearts, lilies of the valley, impatiens, all orderly planted without being structured, all richly blossoming.  
  
  Here was a picture of her mother. With a jolt, Clare realized she was looking at a woman younger than herself. Rosemary Kimball's hair was a dark honey blond, worn poufed and lacquered in the style of the early sixties. She was smiling, on the verge of a laugh as she held a baby on either hip.  
  
  How pretty she was, Clare thought. Despite the bowling ball of a hairdo and the overdone makeup of the times, Rosemary Kimball had been-and was still-a lovely woman. Blond hair, blue eyes, a petite, curvy figure, and delicate features.  
  
  There was Clare's father, dressed in shorts with garden dirt on his knobby knees. He was leaning on his hoe, grinning self-consciously at the camera. His red hair was cropped in a crew cut, and his pale skin showed signs of sunburn. Though well out of adolescence, Jack Kimball had still been all legs and elbows. An awkward scarecrow of a man who had loved flowers.  
  
  Blinking back tears, Clare turned the next page in the album. There were Christmas pictures, she and Blair in front of a tilted Christmas tree. Toddlers on shiny red tricycles. Though they were twins, there was little family resemblance. Blair had taken his looks from their mother, Clare from their father, as though in the womb the babies had chosen sides. Blair was all angelic looks, from the top of his towhead to the tips of his red Keds. Clare's hair ribbon was dangling. Her white leggings bagged under the stiff skirts of her organdy dress. She was the ugly duckling who had never quite managed to turn into a swan.  
  
  There were other pictures, cataloging a family growing up. Birthdays and picnics, vacations and quiet moments. Here and there were pictures of friends and relatives. Blair, in his spiffy band uniform, marching down Main Street in the Memorial Day parade. Clare with her arm around Pudge, the fat beagle who had been their pet for more than a decade. Pictures of the twins together in the pup tent their mother had set up in the backyard. Of her parents, dressed in their Sunday finest outside church one Easter Sunday after her father had turned dramatically back to the Catholic faith.  
  
  There were newspaper clippings as well. Jack Kimball being presented a plaque by the mayor of Emmitsboro in appreciation for his work for the community. A write-up on her father and Kimball Realty, citing it as a sterling example of the American dream, a one-man operation that had grown and prospered into a statewide organization with four branches.  
  
  His biggest deal had been the sale of a one-hundred-fifty-acre farm to a building conglomerate that specialized in developing shopping centers. Some of the townspeople had griped about sacrificing the quiet seclusion of Emmitsboro to the coming of an eighty-unit motel, fast-food franchises, and department stores, but most had agreed that the growth was needed. More jobs, more conveniences.  
  
  Her father had been one of the tow  
n luminaries at the groundbreaking ceremony. Then he had begun drinking.  
  
  Not enough to notice at first. True, the scent of whiskey had hovered around him, but he had continued to work, continued to garden. The closer the shopping center had come to completion, the more he drank.  
  
  Two days after its grand opening, on a hot August night, he had emptied a bottle and tumbled, or jumped, from the third-story window.  
  
  No one had been home. Her mother had been enjoying her once-a-month girls′ night out of dinner and a movie and gossip. Blair had been camping with friends in the woods to the east of town. And Clare had been flushed and dizzy with the excitement of her first date.  
  
  With her eyes closed and the album clutched in her hands, she was a girl of fifteen again, tall for her age and skinny with it, her oversize eyes bright and giddy with the thrill of her night at the local carnival.  
  
  She'd been kissed on the Ferris wheel, her hand held. In her arms she had carried the small stuffed elephant that cost Bobby Meese seven dollars and fifty cents to win by knocking over a trio of wooden bottles.  
  
  The image in her mind was clear. Clare stopped hearing the chug of traffic along Canal and heard instead the quiet, country sounds of summer.  
  
  She was certain her father would be waiting for her. His eyes had misted over when she walked out with Bobby. She hoped she and her father would sit together on the old porch swing, as they often did, with moths flapping against the yellow lights and crickets singing in the grass, while she told him all about the adventure.  
  
  She climbed the stairs, her sneakers soundless on the gleaming wood. Even now she could feel that flush of excitement. The bedroom door was open, and she peeked in, calling his name.  
  
  “Daddy?”  
  
  In the slant of moonlight, she saw that her parents′ bed was still made. Turning, she started up to the third floor. He often worked late at night in his office. Or drank late at night. But she pushed that thought aside. If he'd been drinking, she would coax him downstairs, fix him coffee, and talk to him until his eyes lost that haunted look that had come into them lately. Before long he'd be laughing again, his arm slung around her shoulders.  
  
  She saw the light under his office door. She knocked first, an ingrained habit. As close a family as they were, they had been taught to respect the privacy of others.  
  
  “Daddy? I'm back.”  
  
  The lack of response disturbed her. For some reason, as she stood, hesitating, she was gripped by an unreasonable need to turn and run. A coppery flavor had filled her mouth, a taste of fear she didn't recognize. She even took a step back before she shook off the feeling and reached for the doorknob.  
  
  “Dad?” She prayed she wouldn't find him slumped over his desk, snoring drunk. The image made her take a firmer grip on the knob, angry all at once that he would spoil this most perfect evening of her life with whiskey. He was her father. He was supposed to be there for her. He wasn't supposed to let her down. She shoved the door open.  
  
  At first she was only puzzled. The room was empty, though the light was on and the big portable fan stirred the hot air in the converted attic room. Her nose wrinkled at the smell-whiskey, strong and sour. As she stepped inside, her sneakers crunched over broken glass. She skirted around the remains of a bottle of Irish Mist.  
  
  Had he gone out? Had he drained the bottle, tossed it aside, then stumbled out of the house?  
  
  Her first reaction was acute embarrassment, the kind only a teenager can feel. Someone might see him-her friends, their parents. In a small town like Emmitsboro, everyone knew everyone. She would die of shame if someone happened across her father, drunk and weaving.  
  
  Clutching her prized elephant, her first gift from a suitor, she stood in the center of the sloped-ceilinged room and agonized over what to do.  
  
  If her mother had been home, she thought, suddenly furious, if her mother had been home, he wouldn't have wandered off. She would have soothed and calmed him and tucked him into bed. And Blair had gone off as well, camping with his jerky friends. Probably drinking Budweiser and reading Playboy by the campfire.  
  
  And she'd gone, too, she thought, near tears with the indecision. Should she stay and wait, or go out and search for him?  
  
  She would look. Her decision made, she moved to the desk to turn off the lamp. More glass crunched under her feet. It was odd, she thought. If the bottle had been broken by the door, how could there be so much glass here, behind the desk? Under the window?  
  
  Slowly, she looked up from the jagged shards at her feet to the tall, narrow window behind her father's desk. It was not open, but broken. Vicious slices of glass still clung to the frame. With watery legs she took a step forward, then another. And looked down to where her father lay faceup on the flagstone patio, impaled through the chest by the round of garden stakes he had set there that same afternoon.  
  
  She remembered running. The scream locked in her chest. Stumbling on the stairs, falling, scrambling up and running again, down the long hall, slamming into the swinging door at the kitchen, through the screen that led outside.  
  
  He was bleeding, broken, his mouth open as if he were about to speak. Or scream. Through his chest the sharp-ended stakes sliced, soaked with blood and gore.  
  
  His eyes stared at her, but he didn't see. She shook him, shouted, tried to drag him up. She pleaded and begged and promised, but he only stared at her. She could smell the blood, his blood, and the heavy scent of summer roses he loved.  
  
  Then she screamed. She kept screaming until the neighbors found them.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  CAMERON RAFFERTY HATED CEMETERIES. It wasn't superstition. He wasn't the kind of man who avoided black cats or knocked on wood. It was the confrontation with his own mortality he abhorred. He knew he couldn't live forever-as a cop he was aware he took more risks with death than most. That was a job, just as life was a job and death was its retirement.  
  
  But he was damned if he liked to be reminded of it by granite headstones and bunches of withered flowers.  
  
  He had come to look at a grave, however, and most graves tended to draw in company and turn into cemeteries. This one was attached to Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church and was set on a rambling slope of land in the shadow of the old belfry. The stone church was small but sturdy, having survived weather and sin for a hundred and twenty-three years. The plot of land reserved for Catholics gone to glory was hugged by a wrought-iron fence. Most of the spikes were rusted, and many were missing. Nobody much noticed.  
  
  These days, most of the townspeople were split between the nondenominational Church of God on Main and the First Lutheran just around the corner on Poplar, with some holdouts for the Wayside Church of the Brethren on the south side of town and the Catholics-the Brethren having the edge.  
  
  Since the membership had fallen off in the seventies, Our Lady of Mercy had dropped back to one Sunday mass. The priests of St. Anne's in Hagerstown were on an informal rotation, and one of them popped down for religion classes and the nine o'clock mass that followed them. Otherwise, Our Lady didn't do a lot of business, except around Easter and Christmas. And, of course, weddings and funerals. No matter how far her faithful strayed, they came back to Our Lady to be planted.  
  
  It wasn't a thought that gave Cam, who'd been baptized at the font, right in front of the tall, serene statue of the Virgin, any comfort.  
  
  It was a pretty night, a little chill, a little breezy, but the sky was diamond clear. He would have preferred to have been sitting on his deck with a cold bottle of Rolling Rock, looking at the stars through his telescope. The truth was, he would have preferred to have been chasing a homicidal junkie down a dark alley. When you were chasing down possible death with a gun in your hand, the adrenaline pumped fast and kept you from dwelling on the reality. But picking your way over decomposing bodies kind of knocked you over the head with your own ultimate destiny.  
  
  An owl hooted, causing Deputy Bud Hewitt, who walked beside Cam, to jolt. The deputy grinned sheepishly and cleared his throat.  
  
  “Spooky place, huh, Sheriff?”  
  
  
  Cam gave a noncommittal grunt. At thirty, he was only three years Bud's senior and had grown up on the same stretch of Dog Run Road. He'd dated Bud's sister, Sarah, for a wild and rocky three months during his senior year at Emmitsboro High and had been present when Bud had thrown up his first six-pack of beer. But he knew Bud got a charge out of calling him sheriff.  
  
  “Don't think too much of it during the day,” Bud went on. He had a young, simple face, all curves and rosy skin. His hair was the color of straw and stuck up at odd angles no matter how often he wet his comb and fought it down. “But at night it makes you think about all those vampire movies.”  
  
  “These people aren't undead, they're just dead.” “Right.” But Bud wished he had a silver bullet instead of regulation .38 slugs in his revolver. “It's over here, Sheriff.”  
  
  The two teenagers who had chosen the cemetery to neck in gestured him along. They'd been spooked when they'd come squealing up his lane and banging on his door, but now they were running on panicked excitement. And loving it.  
  
  “Right here.” The boy, seventeen and sporting a denim jacket and scuffed Air Jordans, pointed. He wore a small gold stud in his left ear-a sign of stupidity or bravery in a town like Emmitsboro. At his side the girl, a cuddly cheerleader with doe brown eyes, gave a little shudder. They both knew they'd be the stars of Emmitsboro High on Monday.  
  
  Cam shined his light on the overturned marker. The grave was that of John Robert Hardy, 1881-1882, an infant who had lived one brief year and been dead more than a hundred. Below the fallen marker, the grave yawned wide, a dark, empty pit.  
  
  “See? It's just like we told you.” The boy swallowed audibly. The whites of his eyes gleamed in the shadowed light. “Somebody dug it up.”  
  
  “I can see that, Josh.” Cam stooped down to shine his light into the hole. There was nothing there but dirt and the smell of old death.

Lindsey Fuecht, 43, appeared via Zoom on Tuesday for a court hearing in Wisconsin's Outagamie County after being charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit first-degree intentional homicide. According to a criminal complaint reviewed by Law&Crime, Fuecht allegedly told someone that she had been ""fondled"" by an 18-year-old neighbor when she was 7 years old, but ""nothing was ever done about it"" after she told her mother and stepfather at the time.

She told the unnamed person that ""there needs to be a price to pay, they've ruined my life."" The person who heard her ultimatum then became a criminal informant for the police.

According to the complaint, Fuecht first spoke to the informant at her workplace, a mental health facility, about wanting her mother killed the week of Aug. 11. Fuecht asked the informant if he had ever killed anyone before and allegedly told him that she wanted ""someone to kill her mom."" She allegedly reiterated her wishes to the informant on Aug. 19, the day after the informant alerted police.

The informant told Fuecht during their Aug. 19 conversation that the grisly task would not happen without a cost. Fuecht allegedly said, ""[A]s long as it's not a million dollars."" When the informant told Fuecht that he ""knew a guy,"" he told police that her reaction was ""her face lighting up like a Christmas tree.""

Police surveillance on Fuecht began, and during a recorded conversation between the informant and suspect, Fuecht explained that in addition to her mother not taking any action regarding the purported molestation, the older woman ""may have Alzheimer's and it was 'time for her to go.'""

Fuecht and the informant then started discussing payment, including ""collateral"" or a down payment for the hit job. According to the complaint, Fuecht said that she gets ""ten-grand"" as a tax refund every year but that would mean the would-be hitman ""might have to wait a few months."" Now that Fuecht was allegedly willing to exchange money for murder, a meeting between her and the ""hitman"" — an undercover officer — could take place.

On Aug. 21, Fuecht, the informant, and the undercover officer met in an unmarked car. Fuecht then allegedly expressed her desire to have her stepfather killed as well, saying she would pay the hitman $10,000 for each target. She told the officer that both her parents were ""unhealthy"" and ""ready to go soon, naturally,"" but, she said, ""Not at the same time.""

During their conversation, Fuecht and the officer pitched several ideas to make the deaths look ""natural."" Fuecht allegedly suggested ""oleander flowers and s— I could grow"" to poison her stepfather. Fuecht also allegedly said that she might ""do the first one,"" referring to killing her stepfather herself. She allegedly told the officer, ""I was gonna. I don't know, maybe two.""

Fuecht allegedly emphasized that she wanted both deaths to ""look natural,"" but that they could not happen at the same time. She allegedly specified that she wanted her stepfather to be killed first. One suggestion she allegedly pitched was ""put[ting] something in"" his sleep apnea machine, saying, ""Oh my God, that's a really good idea."" Fuecht also allegedly suggested Visine drops in his coffee, in a mug that only he used.

When it came to ways to off her mother, Fuecht allegedly told the officer ""she was not into blood,"" but that suffocating the older woman ""may look fishier."" Fuecht also allegedly suggested ""making it look like a fall in the shower."" In the complaint, police said that Fuecht told them that she planned to mend her relationship with her mother ahead of her stepfather's death ""so that it looks better.""

Fuecht allegedly told the officer, ""[T]he family will be better without her,"" adding, ""She's gotta go, she's ruining my life."" She also said, ""I love her but… she needs to pay for what she f—ing did, b—.""

Up front, Fuecht allegedly offered the undercover officer a Samsung tablet. According to the complaint, Fuecht told the informant and the undercover officer that both her parents were retired and ""worth millions,"" and she could ultimately provide a $100,000 payment once her inheritance came in. Fuecht said that she was set up to receive ""a couple million dollars"" in the event of her parents' deaths. Police stated that Fuecht allegedly committed to giving the hitman ""$10,000 up front and $10,000 after.""

Upon their verbal agreement, police arrested Fuecht. She was charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit first-degree intentional homicide. Bond was set at $100,000 cash.

I had a blood test done last week and haven't eaten anything for 12 hours.
I asked my internist if I can take statins and he said that I do not have very high cholesterol. Can I lower high cholesterol with diet, how have you adjusted this? I also asked if plant sterols (benecol drink) can be taken, he said it is good for high cholesterol.
I try to eat oatmeal every day with lots of fruit such as (kiwi, berries, banana) chia seeds and linseed. tahini.
further potatoes with boiled vegetables with salmon alternating with chicken fillet. I don't eat much meat. I like to drink black coffee without sugar and milk, sometimes also green tea and/or mint tea. I try to walk every day and can't do high levels of exercise because of fibromyalgia.
for the test I took vitamin D3 1000IU with K2 (27 mcg). maybe I would go to a high dose and also magnesium biglycinate. Which supplements can possibly be taken given my diagnosis for fibromyalgia and I am quite a stress-sensitive person who tends to worry a lot.
Could palmitoylethanolamide help with fibromyalgia? I also want to try L theanine for stress.

I also have a blood test from January 2025, when the values were better, I think.

1n2lxou,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1n2lxou/blithe_images_novel_by_nora_roberts_free_read/,Blithe Images Novel by Nora Roberts Free Read online,"Chapter One  
  
  The girl twisted and turned under the lights, her shining black hair swirling around her as various expressions flitted across her striking face.  
  
  “That’s it, Hillary, a little pout now. We’re selling the lips here.” Larry Newman followed her movements, the shutter of his camera clicking rapidly. “Fantastic,” he exclaimed as he straightened from his crouched position. “That’s enough for today.”  
  
  Hillary Baxter stretched her arms to the ceiling and relaxed. “Good, I’m beat. It’s home and a hot tub for me.”  
  
  “Just think of the millions of dollars in lipstick your face is going to sell, sweetheart.” Switching off lights, Larry’s attention was already wavering.  
  
  “Mind-boggling.”  
  
  “Mmm, so it is,” he returned absently. “We’ve got that shampoo thing tomorrow, so make sure your hair is in its usual gorgeous state. I almost forgot.” He turned and faced her directly. “I have a business appointment in the morning. I’ll get someone to stand in for me.”  
  
  Hillary smiled with fond indulgence. She had been modeling for three years now, and Larry was her favorite photographer. They worked well together, and as a photographer he was exceptional, having a superior eye for angles and detail, for capturing the right mood. He was hopelessly disorganized, however, and pathetically absentminded about anything other than his precious equipment.  
  
  “What appointment?” Hillary inquired with serene patience, knowing well how easily Larry confused such mundane matters as times and places when they did not directly concern his camera.  
  
  “Oh, that’s right, I didn’t tell you, did I?” Shaking her head, Hillary waited for him to continue. “I’ve got to see Bret Bardoff at ten o’clock.”  
  
  “The Bret Bardoff?” Hillary demanded, more than a little astonished. “I didn’t know the owner of Mode magazine made appointments with mere mortals—only royalty and goddesses.”  
  
  “Well, this peasant’s been granted an audience,” Larry returned dryly. “As a matter of fact, Mr. Bardoff’s secretary contacted me and set the whole thing up. She said he wanted to discuss plans for a layout or something.”  
  
  “Good luck. From what I hear of Bret Bardoff, he’s a man to be reckoned with—tough as nails and used to getting his own way.”  
  
  “He wouldn’t be where he is today if he were a pushover,” Larry defended the absent Mr. Bardoff with a shrug. “His father may have made a fortune by starting Mode, but Bret Bardoff made his own twice over by expanding and developing other magazines. A very successful businessman, and a good photographer—one that’s not afraid to get his hands dirty.”  
  
  “You’d love anyone who could tell a Nikon from a Brownie,” Hillary accused with a grin, and pulled at a lock of Larry’s disordered hair. “But his type doesn’t appeal to me.” A delicate and counterfeit shudder moved her shoulders. “I’m sure he’d scare me to death.”  
  
  “Nothing scares you, Hil,” Larry said fondly as he watched the tall, willowy woman gather her things and move for the door. “I’ll have someone here to take the shots at nine-thirty tomorrow.”  
  
  Outside, Hillary hailed a cab. She had become quite adept at this after three years in New York. And she had nearly ceased to ponder about Hillary Baxter of a small Kansas farm being at home in the thriving metropolis of New York City.  
  
  She had been twenty-one when she had made the break and come to New York to pursue a modeling career. The transition from small-town farm girl to big-city model had been difficult and often frightening, but Hillary had refused to be daunted by the fast-moving, overwhelming city and resolutely made the rounds with her portfolio.  
  
  Jobs had been few and far between during the first year, but she had hung on, refusing to surrender and escape to the familiar surroundings of home. Slowly, she had constructed a reputation for portraying the right image for the right product, and she had become more and more in demand. When she had begun to work with Larry, everything had fallen into place, and her face was now splashed throughout magazines and, as often as not, on the cover. Her life was proceeding according to plan, and the fact that she now commanded a top model’s salary had enabled her to move from the third-floor walk-up in which she had started her New York life to a comfortable high rise near Central Park.  
  
  Modeling was not a passion with Hillary, but a job. She had not come to New York with starry-eyed dreams of fame and glamour, but with a resolution to succeed, to stand on her own. The choice of career had seemed inevitable, since she possessed a natural grace and poise and striking good looks. Her coal black hair and high cheekbones lent her a rather exotic fragility, and large, heavily fringed eyes in deep midnight blue contrasted appealingly with her golden complexion. Her mouth was full and shapely, and smiled beautifully at the slightest provocation. Along with her stunning looks, the fact that she was inherently photogenic added to her current success in her field. The uncanny ability to convey an array of images for the camera came naturally, with little conscious effort on her part. After being told the type of woman she was to portray, Hillary became just that—sophisticated, practical, sensuous—whatever was required.  
  
  Letting herself into her apartment, Hillary kicked off her shoes and sank her feet into soft ivory carpet. There was no date to prepare for that evening, and she was looking forward to a light supper and a few quiet hours at home.  
  
  Thirty minutes later, wrapped in a warm, flowing azure robe, she stood in the kitchen of her apartment preparing a model’s feast of soup and unsalted crackers. A ring of the doorbell interrupted her far-from-gourmet activities.  
  
  “Lisa, hi.” She greeted her neighbor from across the hall with an automatic smile. “Want some dinner?”  
  
  Lisa MacDonald wrinkled her nose in disdain. “I’d rather put up with a few extra pounds than starve myself like you.”  
  
  “If I indulge myself too often,” Hillary stated, patting a flat stomach, “I’d be after you to find me a job in that law firm you work for. By the way, how’s the rising young attorney?”  
  
  “Mark still doesn’t know I’m alive,” Lisa complained as she flopped onto the couch. “I’m getting desperate, Hillary. I may lose my head and mug him in the parking lot.”  
  
  “Tacky, too tacky,” Hillary said, giving the matter deep consideration. “Why not attempt something less dramatic, like tripping him when he walks past your desk?”  
  
  “That could be next.”  
  
  With a grin, Hillary sat and lifted bare feet to the surface of the coffee table.  
  
  “Ever hear of Bret Bardoff?”  
  
  Lisa’s eyes grew round. “Who hasn’t? Millionaire, incredibly handsome, mysterious, brilliant businessman and still fair game.” These attributes were counted off carefully on Lisa’s fingers. “What about him?”  
  
  Slim shoulders moved expressively. “I’m not sure. Larry has an appointment with him in the morning.”  
  
  “Face to face?”  
  
  “That’s right.” Amusement dawned first, then dark blue eyes regarded Lisa with curiosity. “Of course, we’ve both done work for his magazines before, but I can’t imagine why the elusive owner of Mode would want to see a mere photographer, even if he is the best. In the trade, he’s spoken of in reverent whispers, and if gossip columns are to be believed, he’s the answer to every maiden’s prayer. I wonder what he’s really like.” She frowned, finding herself nearly obsessed with the thought. “It’s strange, I don’t believe I know anyone who’s had a personal dealing with him. I picture him as a giant phantom figure handing out monumental corporate decisions from Mode’s Mount Olympus.”  
  
  “Maybe Larry will fill you in tomorrow,” Lisa suggested, and Hillary shook her head, the frown becoming a grin.  
  
  “Larry won’t notice anything unless Mr. Bardoff’s on a roll of film.”r />  
  Shortly before nine-thirty the following morning, Hillary used her spare key to enter Larry’s studio. Prepared for the shampoo ad, her hair fell in soft, thick waves, shining and full. In the small cubicle in the rear she applied her makeup with an expert hand, and at nine forty-five she was impatiently switching on the lights required for indoor shots. As minutes slipped by, she began to entertain the annoying suspicion that Larry had neglected to arrange for a substitute. It was nearly ten when the door to the studio opened, and Hillary immediately pounced on the man who entered.  
  
  “It’s about time,” she began, tempering irritation with a small smile. “You’re late.”  
  
  “Am I?” he countered, meeting her annoyed expression with raised brows.  
  
  Pausing a moment, she realized how incredibly handsome the man facing her was. His hair, the color of corn silk, was full and grew just over the collar of his casual polo-necked gray sweater, a gray that exactly matched large, direct eyes. His mouth was quirked in a half smile, and there was something vaguely familiar about his deeply tanned face.  
  
  “I haven’t worked with you before, have I?” Hillary asked, forced to look up to meet his eyes since he was an inch or more over six feet.  
  
  “Why do you ask?” His evasion was smooth, and she felt suddenly uncomfortable under his unblinking gray glance.  
  
  “No reason,” she murmured, turning away, feeling compelled to adjust the cuff of her sleeve. “Well, let’s get to it. Where’s your camera?” Belatedly, she observed he carried no equipment. “Are you using Larry’s?”  
  
  “I suppose I am.” He continued to stand staring down at her, making no move to proceed with the task at hand, his nonchalance becoming thoroughly irritating.  
  
  “Well, come on then, let’s not be all day. I’ve been ready for half an hour.”  
  
  “Sorry.” He smiled, and she was struck with the change it brought to his already compelling face. It was a carelessly slow smile, full of charm, and the thought passed through her mind that he could use it as a deadly weapon. Pivoting away from him, she struggled to ignore its power. She had a job to do. “What are the pictures for?” he asked her as he examined Larry’s cameras.  
  
  “Oh, Lord, didn’t he tell you?” Turning back to him, she shook her head and smiled fully for the first time. “Larry’s a tremendous photographer, but he is the most exasperatingly absentminded man. I don’t know how he remembers to get up in the morning.” She tugged a lock of raven hair before giving her head a dramatic toss. “Clean, shiny, sexy hair,” she explained in the tone of a commercial. “Shampoo’s what we’re selling today.”  
  
  “O.K.,” he returned simply, and began setting equipment to rights in a thoroughly professional manner that did much to put Hillary’s mind at ease. At least he knows his job, she assured herself, for his attitude had made her vaguely uneasy. “Where is Larry, by the way?” The question startled Hillary out of her silent thoughts.  
  
  “Didn’t he tell you anything? That’s just like him.” Standing under the lights, she began turning, shaking her head, creating a rich black cloud as he clicked the camera, crouching and moving around her to catch different angles. “He had an appointment with Bret Bardoff,” she continued, tossing her hair and smiling. “Lord help him if he forgot that. He’ll be eaten alive.”  
  
  “Does Bret Bardoff consume photographers as a habit?” the voice behind the camera questioned with dry amusement.  
  
  “Wouldn’t be surprised.” Hillary lifted her hair above her head, pausing for a moment before she allowed it to fall back to her shoulders like a rich cloak. “I would think a ruthless businessman like Mr. Bardoff would have little patience with an absentminded photographer or any other imperfection.”  
  
  “You know him?”  
  
  “Lord, no.” She laughed with unrestrained pleasure. “And I’m not likely to, far above my station. Have you met him?”  
  
  “Not precisely.”  
  
  “Ah, but we all work for him at one time or another, don’t we? I wonder how many times my face has been in one of his magazines. Scillions,” she calculated, receiving a raised-brow look from behind the camera. “Scillions,” she repeated with a nod. “And I’ve never met the emperor.”  
  
  “Emperor?”  
  
  “How else does one describe such a lofty individual?” Hillary demanded with a gesture of her hands. “From what I’ve heard, he runs his mags like an empire.”  
  
  “You sound as though you disapprove.”  
  
  “No,” Hillary disagreed with a smile and a shrug. “Emperors just make me nervous. I’m plain peasant stock myself.”  
  
  “Your image seems hardly plain or peasant,” he remarked, and this time it was her brow that lifted. “That should sell gallons of shampoo.” Lowering his camera, he met her eyes directly. “I think we’ve got it, Hillary.”  
  
  She relaxed, pushed back her hair, and regarded him curiously. “You know me? I’m sorry, I can’t quite seem to place you. Have we worked together before?”  
  
  “Hillary Baxter’s face is everywhere. It’s my business to recognize beautiful faces.” He spoke with careless simplicity, gray eyes smoky with amusement.  
  
  “Well, it appears you have the advantage, Mr. —?”  
  
  “Bardoff, Bret Bardoff,” he answered, and the camera clicked to capture the astonished expression on her face. “You can close your mouth now, Hillary. I think we’ve got enough.” His smile widened as she obeyed without thinking. “Cat got your tongue?” he mocked, pleasure at her embarrassment obvious.  
  
  She recognized him now, from pictures she had seen of him in newspapers and his own magazines, and she was busily engaged in cursing herself for the stupidity she had just displayed. Anger with herself spread to encompass the man in front of her, and she located her voice.  
  
  “You let me babble on like that,” she sputtered, eyes and cheeks bright with color. “You stood there taking pictures you had no business taking and just let me carry on like an idiot.”  
  
  “I was merely following orders.” His grave tone and sober expression added to her mounting embarrassment and fury.  
  
  “Well, you had no right following them. You should have told me who you were.” Her voice quavered with indignation, but he merely moved his shoulders and smiled again.  
  
  “You never asked.”  
  
  Before she could retort, the door of the studio opened and Larry entered, looking harassed and confused. “Mr. Bardoff,” he began, advancing on the pair standing under the lights. “I’m sorry. I thought I was to meet you at your office.” Larry ran a hand through his hair in agitation. “When I got there, I was told you were coming here. I don’t know how I got it so confused. Sorry you had to wait.”  
  
  “Don’t worry about it,” Bret assured him with an easy smile, “the last hour’s been highly entertaining.”  
  
  “Hillary.” Her existence suddenly seeped into Larry’s consciousness. “Good Lord, I knew I forgot something. We’ll have to get those pictures later.”  
  
  “No need.” Bret handed Larry the camera. “Hillary and I have seen to them.”  
  
  “You took the shots?” Larry looked at Bret and the camera in turn.  
  
  “Hillary saw no reason to waste time.” He smiled and added, “I’m sure you’ll find the pictures suitable.”  
  
  “No question of that, Mr. Bardoff.” His voice was tinged with reverence. “I know what you can do with a camera.”  
  
  Hillary had an overwhelming desire for the floor to open up and swallow her. She had to get out of there quickly. Never before in her life had she felt such a fool. Of course, she reasoned silently, it was his fault. The nerve of the man, letting her believe he was a photographer! She recalled the fashion in which she had ordered him to begin, and the things she had said. She closed her eyes with an inward moan. All she wanted to do now was disappear, and with luck she would never have to come face to face with Bret Bardoff again.  
  
  She began gathering her things quickly. “I’ll leave you to get on with your business. I have another session across town.” Slinging her purse over her shoulder, she took a deep breath. �  
��Bye, Larry. Nice to have met you, Mr. Bardoff.” She attempted to brush by them, but Bret put out his hand and captured hers, preventing her exit.  
  
  “Goodbye, Hillary.” She forced her eyes to meet his, feeling a sudden drain of power by the contact of her hand in his. “It’s been a most interesting morning. We’ll have to do it again soon.”  
  
  When hell freezes over, her eyes told him silently, and muttering something incoherent, she dashed for the door, the sound of his laughter echoing in her ears.  
  
  Dressing for a date that evening, Hillary endeavored, without success, to block the events of the morning from her mind. She was confident that her path would never cross Bret Bardoff’s again. After all, she comforted herself, it had only been through a stupid accident that they had met in the first place. Hillary prayed that the adage about lightning never striking twice would hold true. She had indeed been hit by a lightning bolt when he had casually disclosed his name to her, and her cheeks burned again, matching the color of her soft jersey dress as her careless words played back in her mind.  
  
  The ringing of the phone interrupted her reflections, and she answered, finding Larry on the other end. “Hillary, boy, I’m glad I caught you at home.” His excitement was tangible over the wire, and she answered him quickly.  
  
  “You just did catch me. I’m practically out the door. What’s up?”  
  
  “I can’t go into details now. Bret’s going to do that in the morning.”  
  
  She noted the fact that Mr. Bardoff had been discarded since that morning and spoke wearily. “Larry, what are you talking about?”  
  
  “Bret will explain everything in the morning. You have an appointment at nine o’clock.”  
  
  “What?” Her voice rose and she found it imperative to swallow twice. “Larry, what are you talking about?”  
It’s a tremendous opportunity for both of us, Hil. Bret will tell you tomorrow. You know where his office is.” This was a statement rather than a question, since everyone in the business knew Mode’s headquarters.  
  
  “I don’t want to see him,” Hillary argued, feeling a surge of panic at the thought of those steel gray eyes. “I don’t know what he told you about this morning, but I made a total fool of myself. I thought he was a photographer. Really,” she continued, with fresh annoyance, “you’re partially to blame, if—”  
  
  “Don’t worry about all that now,” Larry interrupted confidently. “It doesn’t matter. Just be there at nine tomorrow. See you later.”  
  
  “But, Larry.” She stopped, there was no purpose in arguing with a dead phone. Larry had hung up.  
  
  This was too much, she thought in despair, and sat down heavily on the bed. How could Larry expect her to go through with this? How could she possibly face that man after the things she had said? Humiliation, she decided, was simply something for which she was not suited. Rising from the bed, she squared her shoulders. Bret Bardoff probably wanted another opportunity to laugh at her for her stupidity. Well, he wasn’t going to get the best of Hillary Baxter, she told herself with firm pride. She’d face him without cringing. This peasant would stand up to the emperor and show him what she was made of!  
  
  Hillary dressed for her appointment the next morning with studious care. The white, light wool cowl-necked dress was beautiful in its simplicity, relying on the form it covered to make it eye-catching.  
  
  She arranged her hair in a loose bun on top of her head in order to add a businesslike air to her appearance. Bret Bardoff would not find her stammering and blushing this morning, she determined, but cool and confident. Slipping on soft leather shoes, she was satisfied with the total effect, the heels adding to her height. She would not be forced to look up quite so high in order to meet those gray eyes, and she would meet them straight on.  
  
  Confidence remained with her through the taxi ride and all the way to the top of the building where Bret Bardoff had his offices. Glancing at her watch on the elevator, she was pleased to see she was punctual. An attractive brunette was seated at an enormous reception desk, and Hillary stated her name and business. After a brief conversation on a phone that held a prominent position on the large desk, the woman ushered Hillary down a long corridor and through a heavy oak door.  
  
  She entered a large, well-decorated room where she was greeted by yet another attractive woman, who introduced herself as June Miles, Mr. Bardoff’s secretary. “Please go right in, Miss Baxter. Mr. Bardoff is expecting you,” she informed Hillary with a smile.  
  
  Walking to a set of double doors, Hillary’s eyes barely had time to take in the room with its rather fabulous decor before her gaze was arrested by the man seated at a huge oak desk, a panoramic view of the city at his back.  
  
  “Good morning, Hillary.” He rose and approached her. “Are you going to come in or stand there all day with your back to the door?”  
  
  Hillary’s spine straightened and she answered coolly. “Good morning, Mr. Bardoff, it’s nice to see you again.”  
  
  “Don’t be a hypocrite,” he stated mildly as he led her to a seat near the desk. “You’d be a great deal happier if you never laid eyes on me again.” Hillary could find no comment to this all-too-true observation, and contented herself with smiling vaguely into space.  
  
  “However,” he continued, as if she had agreed with him in words, “it suits my purposes to have you here today in spite of your reluctance.”  
  
  “And what are your purposes, Mr. Bardoff?” she demanded, her annoyance with his arrogance sharpening her tone.  
  
  He leaned back in his chair and allowed his cool gray eyes to travel deliberately over Hillary from head to toe. The survey was slow and obviously intended to disconcert, but she remained outwardly unruffled. Because of her profession, her face and form had been studied before. She was determined not to let this man know his stare was causing her pulses to dance a nervous rhythm.  
  
  “My purposes, Hillary”—his eyes met hers and held—“are for the moment strictly business, though that is subject to change at any time.”  
  
  This remark cracked Hillary’s cool veneer enough to bring a slight blush to her cheeks. She cursed the color as she struggled to keep her eyes level with his.  
  
  “Good Lord.” His brows lifted with humor. “You’re blushing. I didn’t think women did that anymore.” His grin widened as if he were enjoying the fact that more color leaped to her cheeks at his words. “You’re probably the last of a dying breed.”  
  
  “Could we discuss the business for which I’m here, Mr. Bardoff?” she inquired. “I’m sure you’re a very busy man, and believe it or not, I’m busy myself.”  
  
  “Of course,” Bret agreed. He grinned reflectively. “I remember— ‘Let’s not waste time.’ I’m planning a layout for Mode, a rather special layout.” He lit a cigarette and offered Hillary one, which she declined with a shake of her head. “I’ve had the idea milling around in my mind for some time, but I needed the right photographer and the right woman.” His eyes narrowed as he peered at her speculatively, giving Hillary the sensation of being viewed under a microscope. “I’ve found them both now.”  
  
  She squirmed under his unblinking stare. “Suppose you give me some details, Mr. Bardoff. I’m sure it’s not usual procedure for you to interview models personally. This must be something special.”  
  
  “Yes, I think so,” he agreed suavely. “The idea is a layout—a picture story, if you like—on the Many Faces of Woman.” He stood then and perched on the corner of the desk, and Hillary was affected by his sheer masculinity, the power and strength that exuded from his lean form clad in a fawn-colored business suit. “I want to portray all the facets of womanhood: career woman, mother, athlete, sophisticate, innocent, temptress, et cetera—a complete portrait of Eve, the Eternal Woman.”  
  
  “Sounds fascinating,” Hillary admitted, caught up in the backlash of his enthusiasm. “You think I might be suitable for some of the pictures?”  
  
  “I know you’re suitable,” he stated flatly, “for all of the pictures.”  
  
  Finely etched brows raised in curiosity. “You’re going to use one model for the entire layout?”  
  
  “I’m going to use you for the entire layout.”  
  
  Struggling with annoyance and the feeling of being submerged by very deep water, Hillary spoke honestly. “I’d be an idiot not to be interested in a project like this. I don’t think I’m an idiot. But why me?”  
  
  “Come now, Hillary.” His voice mirrored impatience, and he bent over to capture her surprised chin in his hand. “You do own a mirror. Surely you’re intelligent enough to know that you’re quite beautiful and extremely photogenic.”  
  
  He was speaking of her as if she were an inanimate object rather than a human being, and the fingers, strong and lean on her chin, were very distressing. Nevertheless, Hillary persisted.  
  
  “There are scores of beautiful and photogenic models in New York alone, Mr. Bardoff. You know that better than anyone. I’d like to know why you’re considering me for your pet project.”  
  
  “Not considering.” He rose and thrust his hands in his pockets, and she observed he was becoming irritated. She found the knowledge rewarding. “There’s no one else I would consider. You have a rather uncanny knack for getting to the heart of a picture and coming across with exactly the right image. I need versatility as well as beauty. I need honesty in a dozen different images.”  
  
  “In your opinion, I can do that.”  
  
  “You wouldn’t be here if I weren’t sure. I never make rash decisions.”  
  
  No, Hillary mused, looking into his cool gray eyes, you calculate every minute detail. Aloud, she asked, “Larry would be the photographer?”  
  
  He nodded. “There’s an affinity between the two of you that is obvious in the pictures you produce. You’re both superior alone, but together you’ve done some rather stunning work.”  
  
  His praise caused her smile to warm  
slightly. “Thank you.”  
  
  “That wasn’t a compliment, Hillary—just a fact. I’ve given Larry all the details. The contracts are waiting for your signature.”  
  
  “Contracts?” she repeated, becoming wary.  
  
  “That’s right,” he returned, overlooking her hesitation. “This project is going to take some time. I’ve no intention of rushing through it. I want exclusive rights to that beautiful face of yours until the project’s completed and on the stands.”  
  
  “I see.” She digested this carefully, unconsciously chewing on her bottom lip.  
  
  “You needn’t react as if I’ve made an indecent proposal, Hillary.” His voice was dry as he regarded her frowning concentration. “This is a business arrangement.”  
  
  Her chin tilted in defiance. “I understand that completely, Mr. Bardoff. It’s simply that I’ve never signed a long-term contract before.”  
  
  “I have no intention of allowing you to get away. Contracts are obligatory, for you and for Larry. For the next few months I don’t want you distracted by any other jobs. Financially, you’ll be well compensated. If you have any complaints along those lines, we’ll negotiate. However, my rights to that face of yours for the next six months are exclusive.”  
  
  He lapsed into silence, watching the varied range of expressions on her face. She was working out the entire platform carefully, doing her best not to be intimidated by his overwhelming power. The project appealed to her, although the man did not. It would be fascinating work, but she found it difficult to tie herself to one establishment for any period of time. She could not help feeling that signing her name was signing away liberation. A long-term contract equaled a long-term commitment.  
  
  Finally, throwing caution to the winds, she gave Bret one of the smiles that made her face known throughout America.  
  
  “You’ve got yourself a face.”  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  Bret Bardoff moved quickly. Within two weeks contracts had been signed, and the shooting schedule had been set to begin on a morning in early October. The first image to be portrayed was one of youthful innocence and unspoiled simplicity.  
  
  Hillary met Larry in a small park selected by Bret. Though the morning was bright and brisk, the sun filtering warm through the trees, the park was all but deserted. She wondered a moment if the autocratic Mr. Bardoff had arranged the isolation. Blue jeans rolled to mid-calf and a long-sleeved turtleneck in scarlet were Hillary’s designated costume. She had bound her shining hair in braids, tied them with red ribbons, and had kept her makeup light, relying on natural, healthy skin. She was the essence of honest, vibrant youth, dark blue eyes bright with the anticipation.  
  
  “Perfect,” Larry commented as she ran across the grass to meet him. “Young and innocent. How do you manage it?”  
  
  She wrinkled her nose. “I am young and innocent, old man.”  
  
  “O.K. See that?” He pointed to a swing set complete with bars and a slide. “Go play, little girl, and let this old man take some pictures.”  
  
  She ran for the swing, giving herself over to the freedom of movement. Stretching out full length, she leaned her head to the ground and smiled at the brilliant sky. Climbing on the slide, she lifted her arms wide, let out a whoop of uninhibited joy, and slid down, landing on her bottom in the soft dirt. Larry clicked his camera from varying angles, allowing her to direct the mood.  
  
  “You look twelve years old.” His laugh was muffled, his face still concealed behind the camera.  
  
  “I am twelve years old,” Hillary proclaimed, scurrying onto the crossbars. “Betcha can’t do this.” She hung up by her knees on the bar, her pigtails brushing the ground.  
  
  “Amazing.” The answer did not come from Larry, and she turned her head and looked directly into a pair of well-tailored gray slacks. Her eyes roamed slowly upward to the matching jacket and further to a full, smiling mouth and mocking gray eyes. “Hello, child, does your mother know where you are?”  
  
  “What are you doing here?” Hillary demanded, feeling at a decided disadvantage in her upside-down position.  
  
  “Supervising my pet project.” He continued to regard her, his grin growing wider. “How long do you intend to hang there? The blood must be rushing to your head.”  
  
  Grabbing the bar with her hands, she swung her legs over in a neat somersault and stood facing him. He patted her head, told her she was a good girl, and turned his attention to Larry.  
  
  “How’d it go? Looked to me as if you got some good shots.”  
  
  The two men discussed the technicalities of the morning’s shooting while Hillary sat back down on the swing, moving gently back and forth. She had met with Bret a handful of times during the past two weeks, and each time she had been unaccountably uneasy in his presence. He was a vital and disturbing individual, full of raw, masculine power, and she was not at all sure she wanted to be closely associated with him. Her life was well ordered now, running smoothly along the lines she designated, and she wanted no complications. There was something about this man, however, that spelled complications in capital letters.  
  
  “All right.” Bret’s voice broke into her musings. “Setup at the club at one o’clock. Everything’s been arranged.” Hillary rose from the swing and moved to join Larry. “No need for you to go now, little girl—you’ve an hour or so to spare.”  
  
  “I don’t want to play on the swings anymore, Daddy,” she retorted, bristling at his tone. Picking up her shoulder bag, she managed to take two steps before he reached out and took command of her wrist. She rounded on him, blue eyes blazing.  
  
  “Spoiled little brat, aren’t you?” he murmured in a mild tone, but his eyes narrowed and met the dark blue blaze with cold gray steel. “Perhaps I should turn you over my knee.”  
  
  “That would be more difficult than you think, Mr. Bardoff,” she returned with unsurpassable dignity. “I’m twenty-four, not twelve, and really quite strong.”  
  
  “Are you now?” He inspected her slim form dubiously. “I suppose it’s possible.” He spoke soberly, but she recognized the mockery in his eyes. “Come on, I want some coffee.” His hand slipped from her wrist, and his fingers interlocked with hers. She jerked away, surprised and disconcerted by the warmth. “Hillary,” he began in a tone of strained patience. “I would like to buy you coffee.” It was more a command than a request.  
  
  He moved across the grass with long, easy strides, dragging an unwilling Hillary after him. Larry watched their progress and automatically took their picture. They made an interesting study, he decided, the tall blond man in the expensive business suit pulling the slim, dark woman-child behind him.  
  
  As she sat across from Bret in a small coffee shop, Hillary’s face was flushed with a mixture of indignation and the exertion of keeping up with the brisk pace he had set. He took in her pink cheeks and bright eyes, and his mouth lifted at one corner.  
  
  “Maybe I should buy a dish of ice cream to cool you off.” The waitress appeared then, saving Hillary from formulating a retort, and Bret ordered two coffees.  
  
  “Tea,” Hillary stated flatly, pleased to contradict him on some level.  
  
  “I beg your pardon?” he returned coolly.  
  
  “I’ll have tea, if you don’t mind. I don’t drink coffee; it makes me nervous.”  
  
  “One coffee and one tea,” he amended before he turned back to her. “How do you wake up in the morning without the inevitable cup of coffee?”  
  
  “Clean living.” She flicked a pigtail over her shoulder and folded her hands.  
  
  “You certainly look like an ad for clean living now.” Sitting back, he took out his cigarette case, offering her one and lighting one before going on. “I’m afraid you’d never pass for twenty-four in pigtails. It’s not often one sees hair that true black—certainly not with eyes that color.” He stared into them for a long moment. “They’re fabulous, so dark at times they’re nearly purple, quite dramatic, and the bone structure, it’s rather elegant and exotic. Tell me,” he asked suddenly, “where did you get that marvelous face of yours?”  
  
  Hillary had thought he  
rself long immune to comments and compliments on her looks, but somehow his words nonplussed her, and she was grateful that the waitress returned with their drinks, giving her time to gather scattered wits.  
  
  “I’m told I’m a throwback to my great-grandmother.” She spoke with detached interest as she sipped tea. “She was an Arapaho. It appears I resemble her quite strongly.”  
  
  “I should have guessed.” He nodded his head continuing his intense study. “The cheekbones, the classic bone structure. Yes, I can see your Indian heritage, but the eyes are deceiving. You didn’t acquire eyes like cobalt from your great-grandmother.”  
  
  “No.” She struggled to meet his penetrating gaze coolly. “They belong to me.”  
  
  “To you,” he acknowledged with a nod, “and for the next six months to me. I believe I’ll enjoy the joint ownership.” The focus of his study shifted to the mouth that moved in a frown at his words. “Where are you from, Hillary Baxter? You’re no native.”  
  
  “That obvious? I thought I had acquired a marvelous New York varnish.” She gave a wry shrug, grateful that the intensity of his examination appeared to be over. “Kansas—a farm some miles north of Abilene.”  
  
  He inclined his head, and his brows lifted as he raised his cup. “You appear to have made the transition from wheat to concrete very smoothly. No battle scars?”  
  
  “A few, but they’re healed over.” She added quickly, “I hardly have to point out New York’s advantages to you, especially in the area of my career.”  
  
  His agreement was a slow nod. “It’s very easy to picture you as a Kansas farm girl or a sophisticated New York model. You have a remarkable ability to suit your surroundings.”  
  
  Hillary’s full mouth moved in a doubtful pout. “That makes me sound like I’m no person on my own, sort of … inconspicuous.”  
  
  “Inconspicuous?” Bret’s laughter caused several heads to turn, and Hillary stared at him in dumb amazement. “Inconspicuous,” he said again, shaking his head as if she had just uttered something sublimely ridiculous. “What a beautiful statement. No, I think you’re a very complex woman with a remarkable affinity with her surroundings. I don’t believe it’s an acquired talent, but an intrinsic ability.",1,1756409707.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1n2lxkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1n2lxkf/the_woman_from_victrola_cold_hands/,The Woman from Victrola: Cold Hands,"Marcus found his father examining yogurt labels at the Whole Foods in Roosevelt, reading each one like they might contain messages from the beyond. Five years since Mom died and he still couldn't buy dairy without checking expiration dates three times.

""The Greek stuff is good,"" a voice said. ""More protein.""

Marcus watched his father look up at Serena, who was somehow already beside him, holding a basket of vegetables that looked staged for a cookbook photo.

""Do I—"" his father started.

""I'm Serena. Marcus's—well, we're dating."" That smile, the one that transformed her face. ""You must be Richard. You have the same way of standing, like you're always ready to leave.""

His father laughed—actually laughed. Marcus couldn't remember the last time.

""He didn't mention you,"" Richard said, but not accusingly. More like he was pleased to discover a secret.

""It's new. Few months."" She touched the yogurt in his cart. ""That brand gives me headaches. Something about the cultures they use.""

By the time Marcus reached them, they were deep in conversation about fermentation. His father was animated, gesturing with his hands the way he used to when Mom would let him explain his engineering projects at dinner.

""Marcus!"" Richard's face was bright. ""Why didn't you tell me about Serena?""

""I—""

""You should come to Thanksgiving,"" his father said to her. ""If you don't have plans. It's just family, nothing fancy.""

""Oh, I couldn't impose.""

But she could. She did. The way she said it made Richard insist harder, and Marcus watched it happen like weather, inevitable and beyond his control.

* * *

Three days before Thanksgiving, Marcus tried to end it.

He chose the Vietnamese place on Pine, public but quiet at three in the afternoon. He'd practiced his speech in the car.

""Is this about Sarah?"" Serena asked before he'd finished saying they needed to talk.

""No, this is—""

""Because I understand if you're not ready. If you need to slow down."" Her eyes were already wet. ""I know I love too hard. I can't help it. When I saw you in that coffee shop, so broken, I just wanted to put you back together.""

""Serena—""

The tears came like a faucet turned on, immediate and excessive. The elderly couple at the next table looked over, concerned. At him.

""I found cosmos at Pike Place,"" she said, pulling flowers from her bag. ""I remembered you said they were—""

""My mother's favorite."" He hadn't told her that. Had he? The divorce had scrambled his memory, made everything uncertain.

""I know you're scared."" She reached for his hand, gloves soft against his skin. ""After losing her, then Sarah. I understand being terrified of letting someone care about you.""

""That's not—""

""I'll be better. Slower. Whatever you need."" She was standing now, gathering her things, the cosmos left on the table like evidence. ""I love you too much to trap you.""

Other diners were definitely watching now. The crying woman, the stone-faced man. Marcus felt the narrative cementing around him—another asshole breaking a nice woman's heart in public.

""Serena, wait—""

But she was gone, and somehow he was the one holding the flowers, the waiter asking if everything was alright, and his phone already buzzing with her text: *I understand. Take all the time you need. I'll wait.*

He didn't remember agreeing to continue. But that night she texted a photo from her collection—a 1969 headline about the moon landing—and he found himself responding. The relationship resumed like a held breath released.

* * *

Sarah called during his Thursday client meeting, her voice controlled the way it got during real emergencies.

""Someone tried to pick up Ben from school.""

Marcus stepped into the hallway. ""What?""

""Said she was Aunt Serena. Family emergency. Had all the right information—which teacher, which classroom, even knew about his goalkeeper position. The secretary felt something was off.""

""Where's Ben now?""

""With me. He's fine. But Marcus—"" She paused. ""The woman knew things. That Ben had early release for orthodontist next week. That you usually pick them up on Fridays.""

""Did they get security footage?""

""It's corrupted. Static wherever she appears, like old VHS damage. But Ben saw her. Said she seemed nice but her smile was 'too big, like she was practicing.'""

Marcus's stomach turned cold.

That evening he confronted Serena at her apartment—whichever apartment it was this week. The furniture looked different again, or maybe just rearranged.

""Why would I try to pick up Ben?"" She seemed genuinely confused. ""I was in client meetings all afternoon. Look.""

She showed him emails, timestamps, a paper trail of normalcy.

""Maybe someone else named Serena?"" she suggested. ""It's not that uncommon a name.""

""Who knew he was goalkeeper? Who knew about early release?""

""Marcus."" She set down her wine carefully. ""Listen to yourself. You sound—paranoid. This divorce has traumatized you more than you realize.""

""Don't—""

""I'm not gaslighting you. I'm worried. You're seeing threats everywhere. Your father mentioned you've been anxious, forgetting things.""

""When did you talk to my father?""

""He called me. We're having Thanksgiving together, remember? He wanted to know what you eat now, if you'd gone vegetarian or something."" She laughed, but it sounded like she was trying different versions of laughter. ""He's sweet. Lonely, but sweet.""

* * *

At 2 AM the next Tuesday, Sarah's text woke him: *There's someone outside.*

Marcus drove to the Ballard house, finding Serena's Prius under the maple tree they'd planted when Lily was born. The engine was running, exhaust visible in the November cold. Serena sat in the driver's seat, staring at the house.

She wasn't surprised when he knocked on the window.

""I couldn't sleep,"" she said, rolling it down. ""I was worried about you.""

""Worried?""

""You seemed so upset earlier. About Ben. I thought you might—hurt yourself.""

""By sitting outside Sarah's house you're helping?""

""I love you too much."" She touched his face through the open window, her gloved fingers ice cold even through the leather. ""That's my curse. Loving too much.""

From the house, Marcus could see Sarah watching. Serena waved at her, friendly, normal, like stalking ex-husbands was social courtesy.

""Go home,"" Marcus said.

""Are you sure you're okay?""

""Go home, Serena.""

She left, but slowly, and Marcus stood in his ex-wife's driveway wondering when his life had become something he watched happen rather than lived.

* * *

The infiltration was already complete.

His sister in Portland: ""Your girlfriend is so thoughtful! She found me on Facebook, offered to design my yoga studio logo for free.""

His coworker James: ""Had lunch with Serena yesterday. She's worried about your stress levels. Maybe you should talk to someone?""

His father, calling excited: ""Serena joined my grief support group. She lost her mother young too. We had coffee after.""

Each person had different information. She'd told his sister they'd been dating six months. Told James it was new but intense. Told his father they were practically living together.

""I'm trying to be part of your life,"" she said when he confronted her. ""Isn't that what partners do?""

""You're lying to them.""

""I'm connecting with them. Sorry if that threatens you.""

""You told my father we're living together.""

""Aren't we, basically? I'm here every night.""

She wasn't. Was she? The days blurred together, her presence expanding like water finding cracks.

* * *

Thanksgiving morning, she arrived at his father's house before Marcus, already cooking when he walked in at nine.

""Dad likes to eat early,"" she said, kissing his cheek. ""I remembered from his stories.""

She wore an apron Marcus recognized—his mother's, with the stain from cranberry sauce circa 1997. She moved through the kitchen as if she'd been cooking there for years, reaching for pans without looking, knowing which drawer held the good knives.

""How do you know where everything is?""

""Your dad showed me around last week. I brought him groceries.""

""When?""

""Thursday? Friday? Does it matter?""

His father sat at the dining table, photo albums spread like tarot cards. Serena had been studying them, Marcus realized, memorizing faces and dates and connections.

""Any hereditary conditions I should know about?"" she asked, casual as weather. ""For the medical forms.""

""What medical forms?""

""For the future. Eventually. When we—you know."" She smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. ""Your mom had arthritis, right? Early onset?""

""How did you—""

""Your dad mentioned it. Richard, what was that medication she took?""

His father rattled off drug names Marcus didn't recognize while Serena nodded, taking mental notes or actual ones—her phone was always in her hand, capturing everything.

* * *

The meal was perfect. Too perfect.

She'd made his mother's stuffing without asking for the recipe. The turkey was cooked exactly how Richard liked it. Even the cranberry sauce—whole berry, not jellied, with orange zest Mom always added.

""This tastes just like Anna used to make it,"" Richard said, then looked stricken at mentioning her.

""She taught you well,"" Serena said to Marcus, though he'd never cooked Thanksgiving dinner in his life.

His sister Emma arrived from Portland with her husband Dale and their twins. Serena greeted them like old friends, knew the kids' names, their allergies, that one was left-handed.

""Facebook,"" she whispered when Marcus stared. ""I pay attention.""

But it was more than that. She knew which twin had broken their arm last summer, where Emma had honeymooned twelve years ago, that Dale was considering a career change.

""You must be psychic,"" Emma laughed.

""Just observant,"" Serena said, photographing everyone, everything. ""I love documenting families. They're so intricate.""

After dinner, Richard grew dizzy standing up from the table.

""Dad?""

Serena was there instantly, fingers on his pulse, counting silently.

""Blood sugar drop,"" she announced. ""Richard, when did you last check your levels?""

""I'm not diabetic.""

""Pre-diabetic, though. Right? The medication isn't working like it should.""

She produced items from her purse—glucose tablets, a blood pressure cuff, even a finger-prick tester.

""My mother had the same thing,"" she explained, pricking Richard's finger with practiced ease.

Marcus had never seen anyone's mother with that exact combination. In the bathroom, he found her phone unlocked, open to a medical app tracking his father's health—blood pressure, heart rate, medications, all updated today.

When he found her in his father's study, she was photographing pages from a folder marked ""Important Documents.""

""Your father asked me to help organize,"" she said without looking up.

Richard was asleep on the couch, knocked out from the wine and turkey and whatever else.

""Serena, what are you doing?""

""Helping."" She turned to face him, and for a moment her features seemed to slide, like someone adjusting a mask. ""Your family needs help, Marcus. You're all so isolated, so vulnerable.""

""Get out.""

""From your father's house? That would be rude. Besides—"" She gestured to the sleeping form in the living room. ""Someone should watch him. His heart rate is irregular.""

""You did something to him.""

""I made him dinner. We all ate the same food."" She smiled, that practiced smile Ben had described. ""You're having an episode, Marcus. The stress is getting to you.""

Emma appeared in the doorway. ""Everything okay?""

""Marcus is feeling overwhelmed,"" Serena said smoothly. ""Holidays are hard. First one without Sarah.""

Emma's face softened with sympathy—for Serena, dealing with the difficult boyfriend.

""We should go soon,"" Emma said. ""Long drive back.""

""Drive safe,"" Serena said, hugging her like they were sisters. ""Let's do coffee when you're in town next. I'd love to hear more about the twins.""

As they left, Serena mentioned the family reunion. ""Next summer in Spokane, right? Your dad is so excited.""

Marcus hadn't been to a family reunion since he was twelve. Never mentioned it. But Serena knew the date, the location, who was organizing it.

* * *

""I need you to see something,"" Marcus told Sarah on the phone. ""Tonight. Can you get someone to watch the kids?""

She heard something in his voice. ""Twenty minutes.""

They met at a Starbucks on 15th, neutral ground.

""Follow her with me,"" Marcus said. ""I need a witness.""

""This is insane.""

""I know. Please.""

They took Sarah's car, following Serena's Prius through empty Thanksgiving streets. She didn't drive to Capitol Hill or Fremont or Wallingford, but south, into Georgetown's industrial maze.

The building was abandoned medical offices, windows boarded except where boards had rotted away. Serena entered through a side door that should have been locked.

""We should call the police,"" Sarah whispered.

""And say what?""

Through a broken window, they could see into a large room. People stood in clusters, but wrong—too still between movements, then suddenly animated like someone had pressed play. The walls were covered in photos, documents, family trees drawn in red string. Not just Marcus's family—dozens of families, hundreds of faces connected in patterns that hurt to perceive.

Serena stood at the center, pointing at photos of Lily and Ben. The others moved closer, their faces catching the light wrong, features seeming to shift and stabilize and shift again.

Marcus raised his phone to record. It died instantly—full battery to black screen. The device grew hot in his hand.

Sarah's phone did the same.

""Winter solstice,"" Serena's voice carried through broken glass. ""All families simultaneously. The infrastructure is complete.""

One of the others turned toward the window, and Marcus saw its face clearly—human but not, features that wouldn't hold still, eyes that reflected light like a cat's.

They ran.

In the car, Sarah was shaking. ""What was that? What were those—""

""I don't know.""

""We have to tell someone.""

""Tell them what?""

They drove back with a police officer they'd flagged down. The building was empty. Dusty. Years of undisturbed dust, spider webs, scattered newspapers from 2015.

""Kids probably,"" the officer said. ""Urban exploration. You sure this was the building?""

Sarah looked at Marcus, doubt creeping into her eyes. ""Maybe we were wrong. The streets all look similar down here.""

But Marcus knew. The door Serena had entered was still there, still broken in exactly the right way.

At home, his phone worked again. One message from Serena, sent an hour ago:

*Hope you enjoyed your Thanksgiving walk! Sorry I missed you after dinner. Your dad was worried when you left so suddenly. I stayed to help clean up.*

Attached was a photo: Marcus and Sarah standing outside the Georgetown building, taken from above. She'd been watching them watch her.

Another text: *Your family is lovely. Can't wait to spend more time with them.*

Then: *All of them.*

* * *

In Sarah's kitchen, the kids asleep upstairs, they compared notes.

""She's contacted everyone,"" Sarah said, scrolling through Facebook. ""Your cousins, your college roommate, that friend from your old job. She's connected to all of them now.""

""How long has she been doing this?""

""Some of these friend requests are from weeks ago. Before you even mentioned having a girlfriend.""

Marcus thought about the timeline, how she'd known about Tyler before he'd told her, how she'd found his office without asking.

""What does she want?"" Sarah asked.

""I don't think she's working alone. Those others—""

""Don't."" Sarah held up her hand. ""I can't think about that yet. Just—what do we do?""

Outside, three cars sat on different corners, engines running in the cold night. The windows were fogged but shadows moved inside. Waiting.

""We protect the kids,"" Marcus said. ""We stay together. We watch.""

""And then?""

Through the kitchen window, one of the cars' interior lights came on for just a moment. Serena's face was visible, looking directly at them, smiling that practiced smile.

The light went off.

The engines kept running.

1n2lx7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1n2lx7w/zero_waste_vs_extreme_cheap_scapes/,Zero waste vs extreme cheap scapes,"I’m new to the mindset of zero waste but now that I’m getting into it, I’m realizing that I’ve been doing zero waste this whole time because I’m broke. 

I get a lot of my inspiration on lifestyles by watching extreme cheap scapes. I learned early on that bar soap is cheaper and lasts longer saving you money (coincidence it comes in this packaging). Also, when you get to the end of a soap and you just have a piece left, put it in a piece of pantyhose. When you get enough pieces of soap in there, you’ll have enough in the pantyhose like a regular bar soap again.

Cutting things out of your life that you have to reuse. I don’t buy coffee filters, I reuse cheesecloth (same cloth for two years now) 

Toilet paper, my toilet is not compatible for a bidet, I crocheted some “toilet paper” I wash with a handheld bidet and dry myself with the crochet toilet paper. Same thing with paper towels. 

Water bottles. Just get a filter and refill your jug 

Food. Try to not buy food until you absolutely used up every possible thing you can make, then try foraging or even making your own edible garden. 

Here’s a tip on how to preserve your greens longer. Make your own frozen veggies mix bags. If you’re the person who buys a bunch of produce and it all goes bad in a couple days because he didn’t use it, just spend the extra time, chopping up all the vegetables throw it in a reusable bag and freeze it. I don’t have reusable Ziploc bags, but I reuse them like they are. I’ve been using the same bags for years no need to throw them away and get the reusable ones until I have to. 

Money. Coins can be wasted and are bad for the environment such as pennys for earth worms. Don’t be scared to pick up loose change, money can be used to litter. 

Butcher shops. You’ll be amazed at how many butcher shops waste good meat because it’s not a popular cut. Most organs, the head, limbs, and fat gets thrown away but you can get a good deal on it just look up different ways to prepare these exotic cuts. I do it because I’m cheap, but you can do it to help cut back on waste. 

Hobbies. I crochet. With it there is a lot of scrap yarn and I don’t like making something I’ll never use with the scraps so I use them as stuffing so I don’t have to buy more for my stuffed animals. 

 Clothing. I only shop at thrift stores because I’m cheap, but not only that learn to alter your own clothing. It’s really easy to make tight fitting cloths looser by seam stripping them and resewing them looser saving money and landfill of more cloths. Also cut your shirts into washcloths when they get holes in them, stop buying washcloths. 

Gas. If you can walk, walk. If it’s a 30 min walk that’s not a long walk. That’s an average walking trip. Just get used to thinking a 30 mins walk is not that long and it won’t be. Not only will you save gas money, you’ll be saving the environment, and it’s good for your health. Bonus points if you have a walking buddy it’s good bonding. 

I save over $2000 a year doing all this. But I’m also estimating I’m saving at least 10 lbs of trash a year maybe more. (Basing the pounds off of hypothetical paper towel, toilet paper, coffee filter, plastic bottle usage

each of us stands upon our own small stage.
That stage is our home, our work, and the quiet space within our hearts.

A baby’s cry, endless tasks, moments that refuse to go as planned…
All of these may come rushing in, and still, it is all right.
Address them one by one,
and each step becomes a small victory of the day.

But remember this:
when we chase results too quickly,
life can feel like chewing on something tough and flavorless.
True strength lies in the process itself—
in the gentle smile that says,
“Yes, I have done this.”

Today you are given a choice:
to be swept away by the noise,
or to pause and quietly declare,
“I will set the tone for my day.”

When you meet your child’s eyes during homework,
when you offer your partner a word of gratitude,
when you savor a sip of coffee while the baby sleeps—
in those very moments,
you are already shaping your day with beauty.

And if something was left undone?
Do not worry.
It is only a small stone in the path,
never enough to undo the journey itself.

So let this be your reminder:
“I am the one who shapes the flow of my day.
I gather the small moments,
and weave them into a life both warm and strong.”

Now, allow yourself a smile.

your day has already been lived well.",1,1756409676.0,songs,0,1.0,False

Here is the transcription I received for those interested in what this says:

Dear Hon:

Ordinarily this is the time I'm rushing off to pick you up at the office, full of anticipation, always fulfilled, of a pleasurable evening.  But to-night I have to be content merely with the thought of what we would be doing, and therefor, if you don't mind, I'll take you out.  As usual I don't know where we're going, and you can't help me out, so after parking for a while without coming to any conclusion we start out.  You tell me that you are not tired anymore although you had a busy day, and I promise you I will not fall asleep as I have so many things to tell you.  You usually keep your promise and are nice enough not to chide me for not keeping mine....  We finally find ourselves passing a red light in Long Island, & I'm sore that I didn't see it, as that, per agreement, if not too embarrassable, means a kiss, although you still have lip-stick on.  Before many red lights have passed, your pudding on your luscious lip is gone, and already I'm beginning to feel that the evening will be too short.  We finally spot a place for dinner, & this time we are lucky enough to find *\[illegible\]* place with soft music, and the absence of some crazy jitterbugers is retired & appreciated - 

after one *\[illegible\]* you tell me that you are a little woozy & cuddle a little closer.  I don't discourage you a bit, & soon after I find you in my arms swaying to some slow catchy song, and I detect a sparkle in your eyes, which tells me that you are happy.  I occasionally notice that you are looking at me while I'm not looking at you, but in such a manner that tells me that you are glad we're together, and I make no attempt to deflate my ego, 

//

**Page 2**

as that would end a happy feeling .............  Before I know it, my fears of the early evening have been realized, and I'm rushing to your home, this time I manage to stop for a few green lights aswell, because I realize that I have not kissed you enough, and I'tll be at least another week - - - 

We gulp down a cup of coffee at the diner and I'm standing outside of your back-door while you fumble for those ever-evasive keys.  Its after 4 A.M. now and I kiss you goodnight - a long one, but that thrills me so much that I want another, & I find your lips ready - ....

I'm on my way home now, not as jolly or happy as at the beginning of the evening, as I realize that a long week has to pass before another such evening - - .  Right now I'm feeling just like that only a little worse, because I have to wait more than one week, but time must pass & then I'll again hold you ever so tight......

Darling - I hate to think as I have because it leaves me a little depressed, but then the cycle starts all over again & I feel better for it.  I then become determined to shorten the cycle more & more & finally remove it completely.....

Indeed, this Saturday has been ordained by the Gods or some other supernatural being to be a miserable one.  Firstly all personnel dos to be in camp by 12 Noon to-morrow so that we could not plan any long trips.  I called up Mike last night, and for a moment I thought I might go over & see him, but then I decided against it as 200 miles in one day is too much.  He may come over to see me next week.  Incidently he seemed a little disgusted, & on further inquiry I discovered that his sweety pie is bickering - In 3 short minutes all I could discern was that for some unknown

reason she hasn't made up her mind yet, & he is depressed & disgusted because of it.  It may turn out to be another of Mikes affairs - although he seems in earnest - I'll learn more about it later & relay it to you.....

I decided therfor to play golf instead of going to Fort Bragg, or I should say Tontos decided for me.  He is a real golf bug.  I wasn't too keen about it as the weather was threatening, but his enthusiasm overcame my resistance - & off we went.  The paradox comes in now, that although it hasn't rained here for over 3 months, it suddenly began to pour while we were in the middle of it, & the result was both disastrous to our golf scores & to our skin.  We soon became thoroughly soaked from top to bottom, & I haven't completely dried out yet.... all of these reverses don't daunt an inveterate golfer & as you may have suspected, we're ready to try it again to-morrow, & yes, even if it rains, so don't feel too sorry for me......

I received word from home that the day after Presti left, the office was subletted to some woman & her daughter, (my sister made sure to inform me that they were both old).  They are paying $40 per month, which means that I still have to pay $15, but I'm satisfied as it could have been much worse.  They are leaving most of my equipment in the office which is a big convenience.  Looking back that office has been lucky for me, & I'm sure it'll continue to be so - No?

I enjoyed reading your poem, & flattered to no end to think that it was written for me I can assure you I share your sentiments & only wish that I could express them as well as you have.

Congratulations on your new radio-victrola, & since it gives you pleasure its money well spent.  I'll take you up on that invitation to stay home with you, - & listen to it, & it will not be surprising to me if I invite myself for an encore - you'll have to be polite & not refuse me.

I meant to send you that broken tube, but haven't found a wrapper as yet.  I'm listening to the radio now, & enjoying it immensely - not only the radio, but the thoughts associated with it, which are more dear to me.  I often listen to it at night when everybody is asleep, for then the atmosphere is more conducive for reminiscing, which I like to do......

Your experience at that beauty parlor was odd, although I have to admit & perhaps enhance that he was perfectly right in what he said about you, I for myself would have to add that you are sweet, charming, de luxe.  However, Hon, there are many strange people loose, & it would be best to keep away from his place.  I'll still admire you with a bad hair cut, even combed the way you like it......

Your letter of the next day informed me that you are now minus a few teeth.  I was saddened by the thought that my hon was suffering, & then I thought have I need to tell you that I wanted to see you without those teeth - I'm sorry I was robbed of that pleasure because I wanted to prove to myself that you'd still look swell to me - How did I look without my tooth?

Before I close I want to scold you for those fun remarks you made about having me with your letters & sounding childish.  I'm sure you don't believe that, & if you do, I like to be booed by them & sound childish if you like - My only regret is that I don't get more - although I'm not complaining, just being selfish - again - Goodnight Hon & see you soon - Yours - Paul - ",2,1756409582.0,Transcription,1,1.0,False

  Henrik Ibsen, Rosmersholm  
  
  If only the swans would swim side by side on the dark green lake, this picture might turn out to be the crowning achievement of the wedding photographer’s career.  
  
  He was loath to change the couple’s position, because the soft light beneath the canopy of trees was turning the bride, with her loose red-gold curls, into a pre-Raphaelite angel and emphasizing the chiseled cheekbones of her husband. He couldn’t remember when he had last been commissioned to photograph so handsome a couple. There was no need for tactful tricks with the new Mr. and Mrs. Matthew Cunliffe, no need to angle the lady so that rolls of back fat were hidden (she was, if anything, fractionally too slender, but that would photograph well), no need to suggest the groom “try one with your mouth closed,” because Mr. Cunliffe’s teeth were straight and white. The only thing that needed concealing, and it could be retouched out of the final pictures, was the ugly scar running down the bride’s forearm: purple and livid, with the puncture marks of stitches still visible.  
  
  She had been wearing a rubber and stockinette brace when the photographer arrived at her parents’ house that morning. It had given him quite a start when she had removed it for the photographs. He had even wondered whether she had made a botched attempt to kill herself before the wedding, because he had seen it all. You did, after twenty years in the game.  
  
  “I was assaulted,” Mrs. Cunliffe—or Robin Ellacott, as she had been two hours ago—had said. The photographer was a squeamish man. He had fought off the mental image of steel slicing into that soft, pale flesh. Thankfully, the ugly mark was now hidden in the shadow cast by Mrs. Cunliffe’s bouquet of creamy roses.  
  
  The swans, the damned swans. If both would clear out of the background it wouldn’t matter, but one of them was repeatedly diving, its fluffy pyramid of a backside jutting out of the middle of the lake like a feathered iceberg, its contortions ruffling the surface of the water so that its digital removal would be far more complicated than young Mr. Cunliffe, who had already suggested this remedy, realized. The swan’s mate, meanwhile, continued to lurk over by the bank: graceful, serene and determinedly out of shot.  
  
  “Have you got it?” asked the bride, her impatience palpable.  
  
  “You look gorgeous, flower,” said the groom’s father, Geoffrey, from behind the photographer. He sounded tipsy already. The couple’s parents, best man and bridesmaids were all watching from the shade of nearby trees. The smallest bridesmaid, a toddler, had had to be restrained from throwing pebbles into the lake, and was now whining to her mother, who talked to her in a constant, irritating whisper.  
  
  “Have you got it?” Robin asked again, ignoring her father-in-law.  
  
  “Almost,” lied the photographer. “Turn in to him a little bit more, please, Robin. That’s it. Nice big smiles. Big smiles, now!”  
  
  There was a tension about the couple that could not be wholly attributed to the difficulty of getting the shot. The photographer didn’t care. He wasn’t a marriage counselor. He had known couples to start screaming at each other while he read his light meter. One bride had stormed out of her own reception. He still kept, for the amusement of friends, the blurred shot from 1998 that showed a groom head-butting his best man.  
  
  Good-looking as they were, he didn’t fancy the Cunliffes’ chances. That long scar down the bride’s arm had put him off her from the start. He found the whole thing ominous and distasteful.  
  
  “Let’s leave it,” said the groom suddenly, releasing Robin. “We’ve got enough, haven’t we?”  
  
  “Wait, wait, the other one’s coming now!” said the photographer crossly.  
  
  The moment Matthew had released Robin, the swan by the far shore had beg  
un to paddle its way across the dark green water towards its mate.  
  
  “You’d think the buggers were doing it on purpose, eh, Linda?” said Geoffrey with a fat chuckle to the bride’s mother. “Bloody things.”  
  
  “It doesn’t matter,” said Robin, pulling her long skirt up clear of her shoes, the heels of which were a little too low. “I’m sure we’ve got something.”  
  
  She strode out of the copse of trees into the blazing sunlight and off across the lawn towards the seventeenth-century castle, where most of the wedding guests were already milling, drinking champagne as they admired the view of the hotel grounds.  
  
  “I think her arm’s hurting her,” the bride’s mother told the groom’s father.  
  
  Bollocks it is, thought the photographer with a certain cold pleasure. They rowed in the car.  
  
  The couple had looked happy enough beneath the shower of confetti in which they had departed the church, but on arrival at the country house hotel they had worn the rigid expressions of those barely repressing their rage.  
  
  “She’ll be all right. Just needs a drink,” said Geoffrey comfortably. “Go keep her company, Matt.”  
  
  Matthew had already set off after his bride, gaining on her easily as she navigated the lawn in her stilettos. The rest of the party followed, the bridesmaids’ mint-green chiffon dresses rippling in the hot breeze.  
  
  “Robin, we need to talk.”  
  
  “Go on, then.”  
  
  “Wait a minute, can’t you?”  
  
  “If I wait, we’ll have the family on us.”  
  
  Matthew glanced behind him. She was right.  
  
  “Robin—”  
  
  “Don’t touch my arm!”  
  
  Her wound was throbbing in the heat. Robin wanted to find the holdall containing the sturdy rubber protective brace, but it would be somewhere out of reach in the bridal suite, wherever that was.  
  
  The crowd of guests standing in the shadow of the hotel was coming into clearer view. The women were easy to tell apart, because of their hats. Matthew’s Aunt Sue wore an electric blue wagon wheel, Robin’s sister-in-law, Jenny, a startling confection of yellow feathers. The male guests blurred into conformity in their dark suits. It was impossible to see from this distance whether Cormoran Strike was among them.  
  
  “Just stop, will you?” said Matthew, because they had fast outstripped the family, who were matching their pace to his toddler niece.  
  
  Robin paused.  
  
  “I was shocked to see him, that’s all,” said Matthew carefully.  
  
  “I suppose you think I was expecting him to burst in halfway through the service and knock over the flowers?” asked Robin.  
  
  Matthew could have borne this response if not for the smile she was trying to suppress. He had not forgotten the joy in her face when her ex-boss had crashed into their wedding ceremony. He wondered whether he would ever be able to forgive the fact that she had said “I do” with her eyes fastened upon the big, ugly, shambolic figure of Cormoran Strike, rather than her new husband. The entire congregation must have seen how she had beamed at him.  
  
  Their families were gaining on them again. Matthew took Robin’s upper arm gently, his fingers inches above the knife wound, and walked her on. She came willingly, but he suspected that this was because she hoped she was moving closer to Strike.  
  
  “I said in the car, if you want to go back to work for him—”  
  
  “—I’m an ‘effing idiot,’” said Robin.  
  
  The men grouped on the terrace were becoming distinguishable now, but Robin could not see Strike anywhere. He was a big man. She ought to have been able to make him out even among her brothers and uncles, who were all over six foot. Her spirits, which had soared when Strike had appeared, tumbled earthwards like rain-soaked fledglings. He must have left after the service rather than boarding a minibus to the hotel. His brief appearance had signified a gesture of goodwill, but nothing more. He had not come to rehire her, merely to congratulate her on a new life.  
  
  “Look,” said Matthew, more warmly. She knew that he, too, had scanned the crowd, found it Strike-less and drawn the same conclusion. “All I was trying to say in the car was: it’s up to you what you do, Robin. If he wanted—if he wants you back—I was just worried, for Christ’s sake. Working for him wasn’t exactly safe, was it?”  
  
  “No,” said Robin, with her knife wound throbbing. “It wasn’t safe.”  
  
  She turned back towards her parents and the rest of the family group, waiting for them to catch up. The sweet, ticklish smell of hot grass filled her nostrils as the sun beat down on her uncovered shoulders.  
  
  “Do you want to go to Auntie Robin?” said Matthew’s sister.  
  
  Toddler Grace obligingly seized Robin’s injured arm and swung on it, eliciting a yelp of pain.  
  
  “Oh, I’m so sorry, Robin—Gracie, let go—”  
  
  “Champagne!” shouted Geoffrey. He put his arm around Robin’s shoulders and steered her on towards the expectant crowd.  
  
  The gents’ bathroom was, as Strike would have expected of this upmarket country hotel, odor-free and spotless. He wished he could have brought a pint into the cool, quiet toilet cubicle, but that might have reinforced the impression that he was some disreputable alcoholic who had been bailed from jail to attend the wedding. Reception staff had met his assurances that he was part of the Cunliffe-Ellacott wedding party with barely veiled skepticism as it was.  
  
  Even in an uninjured state Strike tended to intimidate, given that he was large, dark, naturally surly-looking and sported a boxer’s profile. Today he might have just climbed out of the ring. His nose was broken, purple and swollen to twice its usual size, both eyes were bruised and puffy, and one ear was inflamed and sticky with fresh black stitches. At least the knife wound across the palm of his hand was concealed by bandages, although his best suit was crumpled and stained from a wine spill on the last occasion he had worn it. The best you could say for his appearance was that he had managed to grab matching shoes before heading for Yorkshire.  
  
  He yawned, closed his aching eyes and rested his head momentarily against the cold partition wall. He was so tired he might easily fall asleep here, sitting on the toilet. He needed to find Robin, though, and ask her—beg her, if necessary—to forgive him for sacking her and come back to work. He had thought he read delight in her face when their eyes met in church. She had certainly beamed at him as she walked past on Matthew’s arm on the way out, so he had hurried back through the graveyard to ask his friend Shanker, who was now asleep in the car park in the Mercedes he had borrowed for the journey, to follow the minibuses to the reception.  
  
  Strike had no desire to stay for a meal and speeches: he had not RSVPed the invitation he had received before sacking Robin. All he wanted was a few minutes to talk to her, but so far this had proved impossible. He had forgotten what weddings were like. As he sought Robin on the crowded terrace he had found himself the uncomfortable focus of a hundred pairs of curious eyes. Turning down champagne, which he disliked, he had retreated into the bar in search of a pint. A dark-haired young man who had a look of Robin about the mouth and forehead had followed, a gaggle of other young people trailing in his wake, all of them wearing similar expressions of barely suppressed excitement.  
  
  “You’re Strike, aye?” said the young man.  
  
  The detective agreed to it.  
  
  “Martin Ellacott,” said the other. “Robin’s brother.”  
  
  “How d’you do?” said Strike, raising his bandaged hand to show that he could not shake without pain. “Where is she, d’you know?”  
  
  “Having photos done,” said Martin. He pointed at the iPhone clutched in his other hand. “You’re on the news. You caught the Shacklewell Ripper.”  
  
  “Oh,” said Strike. “Yeah.”  
  
  In spite of the fresh knife wounds on his palm and ear, he felt as though the violent events of twelve hours previously had happened long ago. The contrast between the sordid hideout where he had cornered the killer and this four-star hotel was so jarring that they seemed separate realities.  
  
  A woman whose turqu  
oise fascinator was trembling in her white-blonde hair now arrived in the bar. She, too, was holding a phone, her eyes moving rapidly upwards and downwards, checking the living Strike against what he was sure was a picture of him on her screen.  
  
  “Sorry, need a pee,” Strike had told Martin, edging away before anybody else could approach him. After talking his way past the suspicious reception staff, he had taken refuge in the bathroom.  
  
  Yawning again, he checked his watch. Robin must, surely, have finished having pictures taken by now. With a grimace of pain, because the painkillers they had given him at the hospital had long since worn off, Strike got up, unbolted the door and headed back out among the gawping strangers.  
  
  A string quartet had been set up at the end of the empty dining room. They started to play while the wedding group organized themselves into a receiving line that Robin assumed she must have agreed to at some point during the wedding preparations. She had abnegated so much responsibility for the day’s arrangements that she kept receiving little surprises like this. She had forgotten, for instance, that they had agreed to have photographs taken at the hotel rather than the church. If only they had not sped away in the Daimler immediately after the service, she might have had a chance to speak to Strike and to ask him—beg him, if necessary—to take her back. But he had left without talking to her, leaving her wondering whether she had the courage, or the humility, to call him after this and plead for her job.  
  
  The room seemed dark after the brilliance of the sunlit gardens. It was wood-paneled, with brocade curtains and gilt-framed oil paintings. Scent from the flower arrangements lay heavy in the air, and glass-and silverware gleamed on snow-white tablecloths. The string quartet, which had sounded loud in the echoing wooden box of a room, was soon drowned out by the sound of guests clambering up the stairs outside, crowding onto the landing, talking and laughing, already full of champagne and beer.  
  
  “Here we go, then!” roared Geoffrey, who seemed to be enjoying the day more than anybody else. “Bring ’em on!”  
  
  If Matthew’s mother had been alive, Robin doubted that Geoffrey would have felt able to give his ebullience full expression. The late Mrs. Cunliffe had been full of cool side-stares and nudges, constantly checking any signs of unbridled emotion. Mrs. Cunliffe’s sister, Sue, was one of the first down the receiving line, bringing a fine frost with her, for she had wanted to sit at the top table and been denied that privilege.  
How are you, Robin?” she asked, pecking the air near Robin’s ear. Miserable, disappointed and guilty that she was not feeling happy, Robin suddenly sensed how much this woman, her new aunt-in-law, disliked her. “Lovely dress,” said Aunt Sue, but her eyes were already on handsome Matthew.  
  
  “I wish your mother—” she began, then, with a gasp, she buried her face in the handkerchief that she held ready in her hand.  
  
  More friends and relatives shuffled inside, beaming, kissing, shaking hands. Geoffrey kept holding up the line, bestowing bear hugs on everybody who did not actively resist.  
  
  “He came, then,” said Robin’s favorite cousin, Katie. She would have been a bridesmaid had she not been hugely pregnant. Today was her due date. Robin marveled that she could still walk. Her belly was watermelon-hard as she leaned in for a kiss.  
  
  “Who came?” asked Robin, as Katie sidestepped to hug Matthew.  
  
  “Your boss. Strike. Martin was just haranguing him down in the—”  
  
  “You’re over there, I think, Katie,” said Matthew, pointing her towards a table in the middle of the room. “You’ll want to get off your feet, must be difficult in the heat, I guess?”  
  
  Robin barely registered the passage of several more guests down the line. She responded to their good wishes at random, her eyes constantly drawn to the doorway through which they were all filing. Had Katie meant that Strike was here at the hotel, after all? Had he followed her from the church? Was he about to appear? Where had he been hiding? She had searched everywhere—on the terrace, in the hallway, in the bar. Hope surged only to fail again. Perhaps Martin, famous for his lack of tact, had driven him away? Then she reminded herself that Strike was not such a feeble creature as that and hope bubbled up once more, and while her inner self performed these peregrinations of expectation and dread, it was impossible to simulate the more conventional wedding day emotions whose absence, she knew, Matthew felt and resented.  
  
  “Martin!” Robin said joyfully, as her younger brother appeared, already three pints to the bad, accompanied by his mates.  
  
  “S’pose you already knew?” said Martin, taking it for granted that she must. He was holding his mobile in his hand. He had slept at a friend’s house the previous evening, so that his bedroom could be given to relatives from Down South.  
  
  “Knew what?”  
  
  “That he caught the Ripper last night.”  
  
  Martin held up the screen to show her the news story. She gasped at the sight of the Ripper’s identity. The knife wound that man had inflicted was throbbing on her forearm.  
  
  “Is he still here?” asked Robin, throwing pretense to the wind. “Strike? Did he say he was staying, Mart?”  
  
  “For Christ’s sake,” muttered Matthew.  
  
  “Sorry,” said Martin, registering Matthew’s irritation. “Holding up the queue.”  
  
  He slouched off. Robin turned to look at Matthew and saw, as though in thermal image, the guilt glowing through him.  
  
  “You knew,” she said, shaking hands absently with a great aunt who had leaned in, expecting to be kissed.  
  
  “Knew what?” he snapped.  
  
  “That Strike had caught—”  
  
  But her attention was now demanded by Matthew’s old university friend and workmate, Tom, and his fiancée, Sarah. She barely heard a word that Tom said, because she was constantly watching the door, where she hoped to see Strike.  
  
  “You knew,” Robin repeated, once Tom and Sarah had walked away. There was another hiatus. Geoffrey had met a cousin from Canada. “Didn’t you?”  
  
  “I heard the tail end of it on the news this morning,” muttered Matthew. His expression hardened as he looked over Robin’s head towards the doorway. “Well, here he is. You’ve got your wish.”  
  
  Robin turned. Strike had just ducked into the room, one eye gray and purple above his heavy stubble, one ear swollen and stitched. He raised a bandaged hand when their eyes met and attempted a rueful smile, which ended in a wince.  
  
  “Robin,” said Matthew. “Listen, I need—”  
  
  “In a minute,” she said, with a joyfulness that had been conspicuously absent all day.  
  
  “Before you talk to him, I need to tell—”  
  
  “Matt, please, can’t it wait?”  
  
  Nobody in the family wanted to detain Strike, whose injury meant that he could not shake hands. He held the bandaged one in front of him and shuffled sideways down the line. Geoffrey glared at him and even Robin’s mother, who had liked him on their only previous encounter, was unable to muster a smile as he greeted her by name. Every guest in the dining room seemed to be watching.  
  
  “You didn’t have to be so dramatic,” Robin said, smiling up into his swollen face when at last he was standing in front of her. He grinned back, painful though it was: the two-hundred-mile journey he had undertaken so recklessly had been worth it, after all, to see her smile at him like that. “Bursting into church. You could have just called.”  
  
  “Yeah, sorry about knocking over the flowers,” said Strike, including the sullen Matthew in his apology. “I did call, but—”  
  
  “I haven’t had my phone on this morning,” said Robin, aware that she was holding up the queue, but past caring. “Go round us,” she said gaily to Matthew’s boss, a tall redheaded woman.  
  
  “No, I called—two days ago, was it?” said Strike.  
  
  “What?” said Robin, while Matthew had a stilted conversation with Jemima.  
  
  “A couple of times,” said Strike. “I left a message.”  
  
  “I didn’t get any calls,” said Robin, “or a message.”  
  
  The chattering, chinking, tinkling sounds of a hundred guests and the gentle melody of the string quartet seemed suddenly muffled, as though a thick bubble of shock had pressed in upon her.  
  
  “When did—what did you—two days ago?”  
  
  Since arriving at her parents’ house she had been occupied nonstop with tedious wedding chores, yet she had still managed to check her phone frequently and surreptitiously, hoping that Strike had called or texted. Alone in bed at one that morning she had checked her entire call history in the vain hope that she would find a missed communication, but had found the history deleted. Having barely slept in the last couple of weeks, she had concluded that she had made an exhausted blunder, pressed the wrong button, erased it accidentally…  
  
  “I don’t want to stay,” Strike mumbled. “I just wanted to say I’m sorry, and ask you to come—”  
  
  “You’ve got to stay,” she said, reaching out and seizing his arm as though he might escape.  
  
  Her heart was thudding so fast that she felt breathless. She knew that she had lost color as the buzzing room seemed to wobble around her.  
  
  “Please stay,” she said, still holding tight to his arm, ignoring Matthew as he bristled beside her. “I need—I want to talk to you. Mum?” she called.  
  
  Linda stepped out of the receiving line. She seemed to have been waiting for the summons, and she didn’t look happy.  
  
  “Please could you add Cormoran to a table?” said Robin. “Maybe put him with Stephen and Jenny?”  
  
  Unsmiling, Linda led Strike away. There were a few last guests waiting to offer their congratulations. Robin could no longer muster smiles and small talk.  
  
  “Why didn’t I get Cormoran’s calls?” she asked Matthew, as an elderly man shuffled away towards the tables, neither welcomed nor greeted.  
  
  “I’ve been trying to tell you—”  
  
  “Why didn’t I get the calls, Matthew?”  
  
  “Robin, can we talk about this later?”  
  
  The truth burst upon her so suddenly that she gasped.  
  
  “You deleted my call history,” she said, her mind leaping rapidly from deduction to deduction. “You asked for my passcode number when I came back from the bathroom at the service station.” The last two guests took one look at the bride and groom’s expressions and hurried past without demanding their greeting. “You took my phone away. You said it was about the honeymoon. Did you listen to his message?”  
  
  “Yes,” said Matthew. “I delete  
d it.”  
  
  The silence that seemed to have pressed in on her had become a high-pitched whine. She felt light-headed. Here she stood in the big white lace dress she didn’t like, the dress she had had altered because the wedding had been delayed once, pinned to the spot by ceremonial obligations. On the periphery of her vision, a hundred blurred faces swayed. The guests were hungry and expectant.  
  
  Her eyes found Strike, who was standing with his back to her, waiting beside Linda while an extra place was laid at her elder brother Stephen’s table. Robin imagined striding over to him and saying: “Let’s get out of here.” What would he say if she did?  
  
  Her parents had spent thousands on the day. The packed room was waiting for the bride and groom to take their seats at the top table. Paler than her wedding dress, Robin followed her new husband to their seats as the room burst into applause.  
  
  The finicky waiter seemed determined to prolong Strike’s discomfort. He had no choice but to stand in full view of every table while he waited for his extra place to be laid. Linda, who was almost a foot shorter than the detective, remained at Strike’s elbow while the youth made imperceptible adjustments to the dessert fork and turned the plate so that the design aligned with its neighbors’. The little Strike could see of Linda’s face below the silvery hat looked angry.  
  
  “Thanks very much,” he said at long last, as the waiter stepped out of the way, but as he took hold of the back of his chair, Linda laid a light hand on his sleeve. Her gentle touch might as well have been a shackle, accompanied as it was by an aura of outraged motherhood and offended hospitality. She greatly resembled her daughter. Linda’s fading hair was red-gold, too, the clear gray-blue of her eyes enhanced by her silvery hat.  
  
  “Why are you here?” she asked through clenched teeth, while waiters bustled around them, delivering starters. At least the arrival of food had distracted the other guests. Conversation broke out as people’s attention turned to their long-awaited meal.  
  
  “To ask Robin to come back to work with me.”  
  
  “You sacked her. It broke her heart.”  
  
  There was much he could have said to that, but he chose not to say it out of respect for what Linda must have suffered when she had seen that eight-inch knife wound.  
  
  “Three times she’s been attacked, working for you,” said Linda, her color rising. “Three times.”  
  
  Strike could, with truth, have told Linda that he accepted liability only for the first of those attacks. The second had happened after Robin disregarded his explicit instructions and the third as a consequence of her not only disobeying him, but endangering a murder investigation and his entire business.  
  
  “She hasn’t been sleeping. I’ve heard her at night…”  
  
  Linda’s eyes were over-bright. She let go of him, but whispered, “You haven’t got a daughter. You can’t understand what we’ve been through.”  
  
  Before Strike could muster his exhausted faculties, she had marched away to the top table. He caught Robin’s eye over her untouched starter. She pulled an anguished expression, as though afraid that he might walk out. He raised his eyebrows slightly and dropped, at last, into his seat.  
  
  A large shape to his left shifted ominously. Strike turned to see more eyes like Robin’s, set over a pugnacious jaw and surmounted by bristling brows.  
  
  “You must be Stephen,” said Strike.  
  
  Robin’s elder brother grunted, still glaring. They were both large men; packed together, Stephen’s elbow grazed Strike’s as he reached for his pint. The rest of the table was staring at Strike. He raised his right hand in a kind of halfhearted salute, remembered that it was bandaged only when he saw it, and felt that he was drawing even more attention to himself.  
  
  “Hi, I’m Jenny, Stephen’s wife,” said the broad-shouldered brunette on Stephen’s other side. “You look as though you could use this.”  
  
  She passed an untouched pint across Stephen’s plate. Strike was so grateful he could have kissed her. In deference to Stephen’s scowl, he confined himself to a heartfelt “thanks” and downed half of it in one go. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Jenny mutter something in Stephen’s ear. The latter watched Strike set the pint glass down again, cleared his throat and said gruffly:  
  
  “Congratulations in order, I s’pose.”  
  
  “Why?” said Strike blankly.  
  
  Stephen’s expression became a degree less fierce.  
  
  “You caught that killer.”  
  
  “Oh yeah,” said Strike, picking up his fork in his left hand and stabbing the salmon starter. Only after he had swallowed it in its entirety and noticed Jenny laughing did he realize he ought to have treated it with more respect. “Sorry,” he muttered. “Very hungry.”  
  
  Stephen was now contemplating him with a glimmer of approval.  
  
  “No point in it, is there?” he said, looking down at his own mousse. “Mostly air.”  
  
  “Cormoran,” said Jenny, “would you mind just waving at Jonathan? Robin’s other brother—over there.”  
  
  Strike looked in the direction indicated. A slender youth with the same coloring as Robin waved enthusiastically from the next table. Strike gave a brief, sheepish salute.  
  
  “Want her back, then, do you?” Stephen fired at him.  
  
  “Yeah,” said Strike. “I do.”  
  
  He half-expected an angry response, but instead Stephen heaved a long sigh.  
  
  “S’pose I’ve got to be glad. Never seen her happier than when she was working for you. I took the piss out of her when we were kids for saying she wanted to be a policewoman,” he added. “Wish I hadn’t,” he said, accepting a fresh pint from the waiter and managing to down an impressive amount before continuing. “We were dicks to her, looking back, and then she… well, she stands up for herself a bit better these days.”  
  
  Stephen’s gaze wandered to the top table and Strike, who had his back to it, felt justified in stealing a look at Robin, too. She was silent, neither eating nor looking at Matthew.  
  
  “Not now, mate,” he heard Stephen say and turned to see his neighbor holding out a long thick arm to form a barrier between Strike and one of Martin’s friends, who was on his feet and already bending low to ask Strike a question. The friend retreated, abashed.  
  
  “Cheers,” said Strike, finishing Jenny’s pint.  
  
  “Get used to it,” said Stephen, demolishing his own mousse in a mouthful. “You caught the Shacklewell Ripper. You’re going to be famous, mate.”  
  
  People talked of things passing in a blur after a shock, but it was not like that for Robin. The room around her remained only too visible, every detail distinct: the brilliant squares of light that fell through the curtained windows, the enamel brightness of the azure sky beyond the glass, the damask tablecloths obscured by elbows and disarranged glasses, the gradually flushing cheeks of the scoffing and quaffing guests, Aunt Sue’s patrician profile unsoftened by her neighbors’ chat, Jenny’s silly yellow hat quivering as she joked with Strike. She saw Strike. Her eyes returned so often to his back that she could have sketched with perfect accuracy the creases in his suit jacket, the dense dark curls of the back of his head, the difference in the thickness of his ears due to the knife injury to the left.  
  
  No, the shock of what she had discovered in the receiving line had not rendered her surroundings blurred. It had instead affected her perception of both sound and time. At one point, she knew that Matthew had urged her to eat, but it did not register with her until after her full plate had been removed by a solicitous waiter, because everything said to her had to permeate the thick walls that had closed in on her in the aftermath of Matthew’s admission of perfidy. Within the invisible cell that separated her entirely from everyone else in the room, adrenaline thundered through her, urging her again and again to stand up and walk out.  
  
  If Strike had not arrived today, she might never have known that he wanted her back, and that she might be spared the shame, the anger, the humiliation, the hurt with which she had been racked since that awful night when he had sacked her. Matthew had sought to deny her the thing tha  
t might save her, the thing for which she had cried in the small hours of the night when everybody else was asleep: the restoration of her self-respect, of the job that had meant everything to her, of the friendship she had not known was one of the prizes of her life until it was torn away from her. Matthew had lied and kept lying. He had smiled and laughed as she dragged herself through the days before the wedding trying to pretend that she was happy that she had lost a life she had loved. Had she fooled him? Did he believe that she was truly glad her life with Strike was over? If he did, she had married a man who did not know her at all, and if he didn’t…  
  
  The puddings were cleared away and Robin had to fake a smile for the concerned waiter who this time asked whether he could bring her something else, as this was the third course that she had left uneaten.  
  
  “I don’t suppose you’ve got a loaded gun?” Robin asked him.  
  
  Fooled by her serious manner, he smiled, then looked confused.  
  
  “It doesn’t matter,” she said. “Never mind.”  
  
  “For Christ’s sake, Robin,” Matthew said, and she knew, with a throb of fury and pleasure, that he was panicking, scared of what she would do, scared of what was going to happen next.  
  
  Coffee was arriving in sleek silver pots. Robin watched the waiters pouring, saw the little trays of petits fours placed upon the tables. She saw Sarah Shadlock in a tight turquoise sleeveless dress, hurrying across the room to the bathroom ahead of the speeches, watched heavily pregnant Katie following her in her flat shoes, swollen and tired, her enormous belly to the fore, and, again, Robin’s eyes returned to Strike’s back. He was scoffing petits fours and talking to Stephen. She was glad she had put him beside Stephen. She had always thought they would get on.  
  
  Then came the call for quiet, followed by rustling, fidgeting and a mass scraping of chairs as all those who had their backs to the top table dragged themselves around to watch the speakers. Robin’s eyes met Strike’s. She could not read his expression. He didn’t look away from her until her father stood up, straightened his glasses and began to speak.

So for context, we have been dating for nearly 3 years (November). We met through university 1st year 3 weeks in. I fell for her straight away. We met at a party that we were both mutual friends of. The person that brought her was being a bit of a douche and not walking her home. So I offered too. She decided as we only met that evening. But she gave me her socials to keep in touch. A few weeks go by and I send her a message asking if she remembers me and she responded straight away. We got to talking for a few weeks then I eventually plucked up the courage to ask her out. sue said yes.  We went to go to watch a movie it was amazing. I made a mistake doing the booking but she found it cute and told me so. 
After the movie I walked her home. It was awful weather that neither of us expected so we hid underneath some shelter hoping it would ease off (it didn't). So I asked how far away she lives and she said ""about a 5 mins walk"" so I gave her my jumper to put over her head and we ran to her house.  Once we got there she insisted on her dad driving me home as the weather was still awful. So I hopped in the car with her and her dad (bare in mind this was the 1st date).  He starts talking to me asking what I was studying and turns out we both have similar interests so we talk whilst he drove. Anyways once I get back I messaged her thanking her for such a lovely evening and thanking her dad for a lift home. She replied instantly saying she did too and made a suggestion to meet up the next day for a coffee and we did. Then that was us for 2 and a bit years basically inseparable.

Then comes the final year of her university. I still have two years remaining as I needed them. She asks for some space to focus on her work which I completely understand. I only messaged her later in the evening and earlier in the morning so I wouldn't disturb her too much. Due to the nature of her course she needed to do placement hours too complete her degree. So that means some days she would start as early as 7am and finish at 8pm so she wouldn't have time to talk. Which I completely understood. We have a few social events that we went to together being friends bdays etc. other than that we would go a few days without talking sometimes which I found painful but tolerated for her. Once she finally finishes I couldn't see her as I was in work doing long hours making very good money so I couldn't sacrifice it. So I decided to send her flowers and some chocolates congratulating her. She sent me a message just saying ""thank you xx"" which was all I needed (this was about 2 months ago) . So as soon as we are both free she says I don't have time to meet with you now as I'm working full time and made plans to see a old friend this weekend. (An old guy friend from school) Which I was okay with  as she already made these plans. But this kept on happening not with him just making plans and not being able to see me. Which I found to be selfish as I gave her so much time to do her own thing for uni and all I wanted to see her one-on-one. So I started to get really overwhelmed and started having panic attacks. Which her family don't believe in (which is a whole other story). Then we do finally meet up for an event we had booked together and her family went as well. We all loved the show. But in the way there I brought up the idea of us moving in together as it's been nearly three years and I'm fortunate enough to have a family that can provide that sort of arrangement (just us on our own) I said obviously you don't need to decide right now take as long as you need as it's a big ask. Then another weekend goes by where she meets up with another friend from school (different one) for some sort of festival. Then the weekend after that we planned to meet up again her parents were there and we went on a lovely hike. It was amazing spending some quality time with her and the rest of the family. 
The next weekend she goes away again to see once again a different friend and I ask to take her out the weekend after she comes back for a meal in a lovely restaurant.

This is where the shit hits the fan. She says she needs to check her diary which I know she always does anyway. Then she doesn't say anything for 2 days then I ask her again. She says she forgot and will respond after work tomorrow. A day goes by and she says the following.

"". Its just I have been thinking recently about your suggestion of moving in together, and I honestly don’t know if I can move this quickly in our relationship. I just don’t want to be rude and I want to think about how I feel about the whole situation before doing anything dramatic. And I didn’t want to bring it up now as I am tired and wanted to go to bed, but we can talk about it another time if u like?"" I responded with just wow and completely breaking down. Bare in mind throughout our relationship I have treated her like royalty. Literally could of asked anyone and they would of said that. 

Then the next day I ask to call her face time as I needed to talk to her face to face not over text. 
Then my mind kinda goes a little blank but this is all I can remember 

She asks for me to start. I start off by saying stuff like I think you have been a little selfish recently and I have given you all you wanted this year and not get a meal with her because she has been thinking about the other thing I asked her was a bit odd. I once again reminded her that there was no rush. She agrees with me saying that she has been selfish to an extent but needs to have a chat about our future together. This is where I start to panic.   

She says ""well I need to stay where I am as this is probably the only place where I can get a job and progress and you need to move somewhere closer to where you will get a job"" then proceeds to say I don't want to be in the way of your career. I start get get visibly upset and start to have a break down and ask her why she would give it a little effort.  I jump the gun and say is this your way of breaking up with me and she just nods. I immediately hang up the phone and go into histerics I end up hitting my door asi had a build of adrenaline and needed it be released (I know this is a bad sign from me and I'm fully aware of that I'm getting medical help for anger issues now) but I call her back just saying why, how could she do this to me. She says she didn't want to use me going forward. 

She then says she is heartbroken too and it's unfair. 

She also says ""I think maybe it’s best to just take some time to processes. I think I need to as well.""

What should I do. I love her so much and don't want to lose her. I would travel for work every day if I needed to just to be with her. I'm so broken right now I'm losing the will to do anything I haven't been able to walk my dog because of it making me a twat of a owner.

My bookkeepers email me a simple “morning coffee” snapshot, and now I’m planning on building a tiny dashboard for myself to keep the same vibe—simple, not overly complex.

What I look at now:

* Income, Expense, Profit, Cash balance (month-to-date)
* A month-over-month revenue line (just to see trend)

For you:

* What do you actually glance at most mornings?
* Anything you’d add/remove for a basic daily view?
* Daily vs monthly vs weekly—what’s most useful?
* Any quick ratios you truly use (cash runway, receivables aging, MRR/ARR, etc.)?

I was just surviving on Chipotle, coffee, and whatever snacks I could grab between classes, and honestly, I was feeling like crap. My grades were okay, but I knew I could do better. My energy was low, my room was messy and there was no sequence for anything.

I decided to make a change. First, I started meal prepping. Instead of spending ten dollars every lunch on burritos, I cooked for myself a few times a week. It was actually kind of fun experimenting with recipes, and I saved money too. That extra cash made me think about my finances, which I had completely ignored until then. I set up a fizz card to track my spending and start building my credit responsibly. Seeing exactly where my money was going made a bigger difference than I expected and motivated me to be smarter with my budget.

Next, I focused on working out. Before, I would always say I would go laterbut  I never did. I started with short, consistent sessions in my dorm or at the campus gym. Even just twenty minutes made me feel more energised and focused in class.

Studying got better too. I started blocking out time. I planned my week, reviewed notes daily, and took breaks that didn’t involve scrolling Insta. Productivity started feeling like a habit instead of a chore.

It’s still a work in progress and I procrastinate, but seeing all the small wins stack up, the meals I prepped, the workouts I didn’t skip, and my money tracked with credit improving feels really good. I don’t miss just surviving on burritos.

If anyone else is struggling with college chaos and wants to get their life in order, start small. Meal prep one week, plan study sessions, and track your spending. Little wins really add up, which will eventually make you productive and better.

  “I’ll gut this bitch if you take another step, Mohiri.”  
  
  I fingered the hilt of my sword as I studied the vampire pressed back against the wall with the human girl dangling by her throat in front of him. The girl’s face was a mask of terror when the vampire’s claws drew blood from her throat. I could feel her staring at me, silently pleading with me to save her.  
  
  I kept my attention on the vampire. “If you think the human will save you from me, you are sadly mistaken, my friend.”  
  
  He shifted from one foot to the other, his eyes darting around for another means of escape. He knew what I was, and he also had to know there was no way he was leaving this place alive. I had to convince him not to take the girl down with him.  
  
  From another part of the house, a scream rang out and was quickly cut short.  
  
  The vampire’s eyes widened, and the hand around the girl’s throat shook. “You protect humans. You won’t do anything that will hurt her.”  
  
  My gaze locked with his. “I do protect them, but I’m a hunter above all else. Seeing her blood on your hands will only make me hungrier for the kill.”  
  
  He swallowed hard, glancing at the door four feet away from him.  
  
  I made the decision easier for him and moved two feet in the other direction. I even lowered my sword to let him think he had a sporting chance.  
  
  The girl cried out as he threw her at me. I caught her with one arm and set her aside.  
  
  The vampire sped toward the door. He was fast – at least fifty years old.  
  
  I was faster. My sword sliced through the side of his throat. He croaked and clamped his hand over the wound, but not before blood sprayed across the Victorian-style wallpaper and the pale blue carpet.  
  
  The girl screamed.  
  
  I went after the vampire, who staggered to the door. Bringing my sword up, I skewered him through the heart with enough force to embed the tip of my blade in the wall behind him. I yanked it free, and he crumpled to the floor.  
  
  Chris appeared in the doorway, his own sword dripping blood. “That’s the last of them. I found a human male upstairs. He’s lost a lot of blood, but he’ll live.”  
  
  “Good.”  
  
  We’d discovered four teenagers in the nest of seven vampires. That two of the humans had survived was a small miracle.  
  
  The girl whimpered.  
  
  Chris stood his sword against the wall and approached her slowly. “It’s okay. You’re safe now.”  
  
  She threw herself at him, wrapping her arms around his waist as she sobbed. Chris gave me a helpless look, and I shrugged. There was nothing I could do for the girl he wasn’t doing already.  
  
  I pulled out my cell and nodded toward the door. “Looks like you have the situation under control. I’ll call Denis and tell him to send a cleanup crew.”  
  
  The night was warm and muggy when I left the house and called the local unit to give them the address. I also let them know we had a couple of human teenagers needing medical attention. I waited for ten minutes until they pulled up in front of the house, and then I walked down the street to where Chris and I had parked our bikes in the driveway of an empty house.  
  
  Pulling off my bloody T-shirt, I found a clean spot and wiped my face. I used the shirt to wipe down my sword before I stowed the weapon away in the sheath that ran along the bottom of my seat.  
  
  I was donning a clean shirt when Chris walked up to me. “Why is it they never cling to you like that?” he asked as he went to his bike.  
  
  I laughed at his sullen expression. “Must be your smile that draws them to you.”  
  
  He yanked off his shirt. “It wouldn’t kill you to comfort them every now and then.”  
  
  “But you are so good at it.” I sat on my bike and waited for him to clean up. “I keep them alive and kill the bad guys.”  
  
  I didn’t need to add that I had no clue how to handle an overwrought teenager. Unlike Chris, I didn’t associate with humans on any kind of personal level. They were my job. I protected them and kept them safe from the monsters they didn’t know existed. As a warrior, it was better to remain detached. Closeness created emotions, and emotions created distractions. Distractions got you or the people you were protecting killed.  
  
  Chris scoffed and mounted his bike. “Beer?”  
  
  “Sounds good.”  
  
  Thirty minutes later, freshly showered and changed, we walked into the bar down the street from our hotel. We found a table against the back wall, and I sat facing the door. I liked to know who – or what – was coming and going from a place while I was there.  
  
  A pretty blonde waitress came over to take our drink orders, and her red lips curved into an inviting smile when she looked from Chris to me.  
  
  “What can I get for you gentlemen?”  
  
  We ordered whatever they had on tap and a couple of burgers. The waitress lingered at the table for a moment before she went off to put in our order.  
  
  Chris leaned back and ran a hand through his blond hair. “I’d call that a good night’s work.”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  My eyes swept the bar. At a corner table a young couple were making out, oblivious to everyone around them. I wouldn’t have noticed them if I hadn’t caught the gleam of silver in the male’s eyes. Incubus. Most of the sex demons were careful not to harm humans when they fed from them, but there were some who loved the thrill of the kill. I wasn’t sure yet which way this one swung.  
  
  A laugh drew my attention bac  
k to Chris. I shot him a questioning look.  
  
  “You are so predictable, my friend.” He inclined his head toward the incubus. “We haven’t had our first beer, and you’re already looking for your next fight.”  
  
  “Just keeping an eye on things.”  
  
  The waitress returned with two glasses of draft and set them before us.  
  
  Chris picked up his beer and drank deeply. “Relax. I saw the two of them in here last night. If he was going to hurt her, he would have done it by now.”  
  
  He was right. An incubus intent on killing his victim would do it within a few hours. He certainly wouldn’t come back for a second date.  
  
  I gave the pair one last glance then turned my attention to my beer. I preferred a nice aged Scotch, but the rich lager was good for quenching thirst. I downed half the contents before I set the glass down and stretched out my legs beneath the table.  
  
  Chris looked at me as if he was waiting for me to say something. When I didn’t, he said, “So, you want to stick around here for a few days?”  
  
  “I don’t mind staying here for a day or two. They’re having a problem with lamprey demons in Bywater, and I told Denis we’d give them a hand.”  
  
  “That wasn’t exactly what I had in mind,” he replied dryly.  
  
  I let out a laugh. “What’s her name?” Chris only suggested we take some downtime after a job when he’d met a female he wanted to get more acquainted with.  
  
  He grinned over the top of his beer. “Nora. She’s a student at Tulane, and she invited us to a party at her sorority tonight.”  
  
  “I think I’ll pass.” Intoxicated coeds were not my idea of an entertaining night. I could think of more pleasurable ways to spend an evening. An interesting book, a good game of poker, a bottle of Macallan, to name a few. Or a beautiful female friend who knew me well, in and out of the bedroom.  
  
  “Let me guess your plans for tonight. Prowling the streets to keep the good people of New Orleans safe, or staying in your room with a book?”  
  
  I suppressed a chuckle. He knew me too well. “Neither, actually. Viv’s in town.”  
  
  “Ah, the lovely Vivian. It’s been a while, hasn’t it?”  
  
  “Two years.”  
  
  “That long?” He smiled over the rim of his glass. “I guess I won’t be seeing you for breakfast then.”  
  
  “Probably not.” Or for lunch, knowing Viv.  
  
  Our food arrived, and as we ate, we talked about the job we’d just finished. A week ago, we’d gotten word of an increased vampire presence in New Orleans, along with a rash of missing persons, mostly teenagers. New Orleans was already a hub of supernatural activity that kept the local unit busy, so Chris and I had come to help them out with the vampire problem.  
  
  It had taken us three days to find one of the elusive vampires and trail him back to the nest in the Garden District. It didn’t require much guesswork to know what had happened to the previous owner of the old house the vampires had claimed for their own. We’d watched the place for a day and then made our move.  
  
  I hadn’t expected to find human survivors, and that made the job even more satisfying. I’d told the vampire I cared about the hunt more than the humans, but that was a lie. Nothing was more important than protecting human lives.  
  
  Chris crumpled his napkin and tossed it on his empty plate. “I was thinking we could head west when we leave Louisiana. There’s always something going on out that way, and we could pay a visit to Longstone while we’re there.”  
  
  “How long has it been since you were home?” Longstone was the Mohiri stronghold in Oregon where Chris grew up. His parents moved to Germany a few years ago, but he still had family at the stronghold.  
  
  “I haven’t been back since my parents left, almost three years.”  
  
  I pushed my plate away and reached for my beer. “Sounds like a plan. We can stop over at Westhorne on the way.”  
  
  His phone buzzed, and he smiled when he looked at the screen. “Right on time. I need to go meet my date.” He stood and threw some money on the table. “Say hello to Vivian for me.”  
  
  “Will do.” I pulled out my phone and texted Viv, asking if she was up for some company.  
  
  I smiled when she replied immediately. Do you need to ask?  
  
  Tossing some cash on the table, I stood and headed for the door. See you in ten.  
  
  Vivian’s suite was on the top floor of the Ritz-Carlton, and she answered the door wearing a white silk robe, with her long, blonde hair loose around her shoulders.  
  
  “Nikolas!” She pulled me into the room, hugging me before she’d even shut the door. “It’s so good to see you.”  
  
  Chuckling, I hugged her back. “Great to see you, too.” I pulled back and looked down at her short robe that came to mid-thigh. “If I’d known you’d greet me like this, I would have come to visit you a lot sooner.”  
  
  A throaty laugh slipped from her. She pulled my head down to hers for a slow, languid kiss that was sensual, but also warm and familiar. My other sexual encounters were just about mutual pleasure. Vivian Day was more than that. She was a good friend whose company I enjoyed, and there were no strings attached. She wanted to be tied down even less than I did, if that was possible.  
  
  Breaking the kiss, she took my hand and led me into the living room of her suite that had a great view of the French Quarter. She sat on the couch and made me sit beside her.  
  
  She arranged her robe around her legs. “I couldn’t believe it when I heard you were in New Orleans. It’s been too long.”  
  
  “It has. But then you’re the one who’s always off on some mission for the Council whenever I’m on your side of the world.”  
  
  “Maybe if you’d agree to work for them, we’d see each other more.”  
  
  I stretched out my legs. “I love you, Viv, but I have zero interest in working for a bunch of bureaucrats. I respect the Council for what they do, but I prefer to work my own way.”  
  
  She gave me a knowing smile. “Still haven’t outgrown that little aversion to authority.”  
  
  I laughed. “And you still know me better than anyone.”  
  
  I’d known Vivian most of my life, our friendship going back to my early years in England when my sire was leader of Hadan Castle. Vivian and I had trained together, and the two of us had been competitive, driving each other to work harder.  
  
  She got up and went to the bar. “Drink? They didn’t have any Macallan, but they brought up a bottle of Bowmore.”  
  
  “Only if you’re having one.”  
  
  “Of course.” She poured two drinks and came back to the couch, handing one to me. “I can’t believe it’s been two years. I remember when I couldn’t imagine not seeing you every day.”  
  
  “What was it you said back then? When we became warriors, we’d go off and hunt together, just the two of us.”  
  
  Her eyes sparkled with laughter. “That’s because I was afraid you’d beat me in vampire kills if I left you alone.”  
  
  I sipped my drink. “And it had nothing to do with the huge crush you had on me?”  
  
  “Ha! If anyone had a crush, it was you. You were a lovesick fool that first time.”  
  
  “I was a horny teenager, and the prettiest girl I knew wanted to have sex with me.”  
  
  When she’d come to me one day and told me she wanted her first time to be with her best friend, my sixteen-year-old self had needed no persuasion. We still laughed over how awkward the two of us had been that first time.  
  
  She burst out laughing. “I’ll never forget the look on your face when I asked you. You went from shocked to ‘let’s do it’ in about five seconds.”  
  
  “Three. I was trying not to look too eager.”  
  
  “God, we were something.” She took my free hand and laced our fingers together. “Sometimes I miss those days. Life was a lot simpler back then.”  
  
  “Are you being nostalgic, or is something going on?”  
  
  “I’m great, just a little weary, I guess. I’ve been on the road for almost a year. You know how it is.”  
  
  “I usually get back to Westhorne every month or two.”  
  
   
The life of a warrior often took you away from home for long periods, unless you were mated. Mated couples tended to stay closer to home, at least for the first few years. I couldn’t stay in one place for a long time. Neither could Viv, which was one of the reasons both of us were happily unmated, much to our mothers’ mutual despair.  
  
  She swirled the amber liquid in her glass. “I was surprised to hear you no longer work solo, and that you and Chris have been partnering on a lot of jobs.”  
  
  “Yes. It keeps the Council off my back. Well, almost.”  
  
  The Council of Seven was the ruling body for our people, and most of them had their own ideas about how things should be run in the field. They liked everyone to work in teams, and it annoyed them when someone didn’t follow their protocols. I wasn’t on their list of favorite people, and I didn’t lose any sleep over it.  
  
  “So where is your partner tonight?” she asked with a smile that said she could already guess what Chris was up to.  
  
  “Sorority party.”  
  
  She laughed. “Let me guess, not your thing?”  
  
  “You could say that. And I wouldn’t pass up a chance to see you.”  
  
  Her eyes softened. “You always say the sweetest things, Nikolas Danshov.”  
  
  I finished my drink and gave her a small smile. “Keep that to yourself. I have a reputation to protect.”  
  
  She grinned. “I’m well aware of your reputation, and I’ll do what I can to keep it safe. But it’s going to cost you.”  
  
  “What’s it going to cost?”  
  
  She stood and took my glass, setting it on the coffee table with hers. Then she reached for my hands and tugged me to my feet.  
  
  She turned to the bedroom. “I’m sure I can think of something.

She’s good, isn’t she?” Chris inclined his head toward the small group of trainees practicing their swordplay. Most of them were skilled with the weapon, but the blonde moved with a lethal grace that I’d seen only in more experienced warriors. Next to her, the other trainees looked like children with toy swords.  
  
  I watched the girl’s opponent lunge at her. At the last second, she parried and slipped her blade behind his, sending his weapon flying away from him.  
  
  I nodded. “She’ll make a fine warrior.”  
  
  The boy she’d disarmed retrieved his sword and turned to say something to her. He noticed us watching them and flushed. The other trainees stopped their practice and turned to see what their friend was staring at.  
  
  I inclined my head at them in acknowledgement.  
  
  Chris smirked. “Your adoring fans. Maybe you should give them a lesson while we’re here.”  
  
  “I’ll leave that to the real trainers.” I shouldered my bag and resumed my walk to the main building. Some people were cut out for teaching; I was not one of them. I had neither the patience nor the inclination toward that vocation, though I had a ton of admiration for those who did. There were few jobs more important than molding our youth into warriors capable of defending themselves when they went out into the world.  
  
  A grinning red-haired warrior left the building as we neared it. “About time you two showed your mugs around here. How long are you back for this time?”  
  
  “Couple of days,” Chris said. “Thought you and Niall were still in Ireland.”  
  
  “Nah. Got back last week.” Seamus’s eyes gleamed. “Brought back a couple of bottles of good Irish whiskey. Stop by later and we’ll catch up.”  
  
  “Sounds good.” Anything that involved Seamus, his twin, and a bottle of whiskey promised to be entertaining.  
  
  Chris and I entered the building and went directly to the south wing. People greeted us as we passed, but we didn’t stop to talk. I said good-bye to him at his door and stepped into my own apartment, dropping my bag on the floor. After a month away, it was nice to be back in my own place.  
  
  My gaze swept over the living room, taking in the dark colors and the simple yet comfortable décor. Aside from the portrait of my parents, there was no art on the walls. My collection of antique swords hung on one wall, and above the mantle was a pair of Flintlock pistols that had belonged to Alexander II – a gift from my sire who had received them from the emperor. There was a full bookcase and a state of the art audio system, but no television. I preferred it that way.  
  
  Kicking off my boots, I tossed my jacket on the back of the leather couch and headed for the shower to wash off the grime of the road. Ten minutes later, I emerged with a towel around my hips and put on my favorite sixties rock mix.  
  
  I was tempted to drop the towel and crash on the bed for a few hours, but I knew Tristan would be by when he got word we were here. I pulled on a T-shirt and a pair of sweats, grabbed my Slaughterhouse-Five paperback, and stretched out on the couch to read until he dropped in.  
  
  A little over an hour later, a knock came on the door. I called out for him to enter, and Tristan walked in wearing a wide smile.  
  
  “Heard you were back,” he said, sitting in the leather chair across from me.  
  
  I sat up and laid my book on the couch beside me. “You’re getting slow. I expected you half an hour ago.”  
  
  He laughed and settled back in his chair. “Council business. You know how it is.”  
  
  “No, I don’t, and I’m happy that way.”  
  
  Like any government, the Council spent half their time embroiled in debates and wrapped up in meetings. Some days, Tristan spent more time talking to the Council than he did running the affairs at Westhorne. Where he got the patience to handle them day after day was beyond me.  
  
  “Well, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to you that we were discussing your latest job. They aren’t happy you and Chris went into that nest in New Orleans without backup.”  
  
  I had never explained my actions to the Council, and I wasn’t going to start now. But Tristan was my friend, and I respected him too much to not tell him what he wanted to know.  
  
  “I would have invited Denis’s team along, but you know how busy those guys are down there. Chris and I did our due diligence, and we knew exactly what we were facing when we went in. A nest of seven vampires is nothing we haven’t faced before.”  
  
  Tristan nodded. “The Council says you should have followed protocol and called in one of the teams from Houston or Atlanta once you located the nest.”  
  
  “We could have, but we would have been too late to save those two human teenagers. And saving human lives is our first priority, is it not?”  
  
  “It is.” His fingers tapped out a rhythm on the arm of the chair. “I’m required to tell you that you are too valuable to risk your life needlessly. And that you must follow procedure next time you are in a similar situation.”  
  
  “Noted.”  
  
  “Now that we have that out of the way.” He smiled and leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “How was New Orleans?”  
  
  “Busy. We helped Denis’s people with a lamprey infestation, and we raided a gulak operation that was breeding bazerats. They could use some more people down there.”  
  
  “I’ll bring it up to the Council.”  
  
  “Good.” I knew Denis would have another team at his disposal by the end of the week.  
  
  Tristan gave me an amused look. “Surely it wasn’t all work and no play. It is New Orleans after all.”  
  
  I shrugged. “We ate, we drank, we listened to some good music. Chris got to know the locals a little better.”  
  
  The two of us laughed because we knew how much his nephew loved getting to know the locals. Chris treated the females well, and he never made any promises he couldn’t keep. He’d left a trail of pining hearts from the Atlantic to the Pacific.  
  
  “I heard Vivian is there for two weeks. Did you see her?”  
  
  “Yes. We spent some time catching up. It was great to see her again.”  
  
  He smiled fondly. There were few who knew Viv and didn’t like her. “Why didn’t you stay on a few more days with her? You didn’t need to rush back here.”  
  
  I raised an eyebrow at him. “Careful. You are dangerously close to sounding like my mother.”  
  
  My mother had two missions in her life: protecting humanity and seeing me happily settled. After almost two hundred years, you’d think she would let the second one go.  
  
  “Irina wants her son to be happy. It’s what every parent wishes for their child.” Sadness flickered in Tristan’s eyes, and I knew he was thinking about Madeline. Over fifty years had passed since she’d left, but she was never far from her father’s thoughts.  
  
  “I am happy,” I grumbled.  
  
  He chuckled and looked around. “How long are you planning to stay this time?”  
  
  “Three or four days and then Chris wants to visit Longstone. From there, who knows?”  
  
  “Sometimes I envy you, my friend.”  
  
  “I keep telling you to come with us. Claire is more than capable of managing Westhorne in your absence.” And the Council would learn to deal with it. They deferred too much to Tristan as it was. The Seven ruled together, but at times they treated him like their unofficial leader.  
  
  “One of these days I’ll take you up on that.” He ran his hand through his blond hair. “How would you feel about postponing your trip to Oregon? We’ve received word of a possible vampire problem in Maine, and I was hoping you would look into it.”  
  
  “Maine? That’s werewolf territory. Vampires usually avoid that place like the plague.”  
  
  “True, but there have been a number of disappearances in Portland in recent weeks. Four human girls have gone missing with no trace, all close to the same age. The authorities there have no evidence or leads. I might have dismissed it if we hadn’t also gotten word of several dead bodies with animal attack listed as the cause of death.”  
  
  “Do we have anyone in Portland now?” We didn’t keep a permanent Mohiri presence in Ma  
ine because it was usually very quiet there.  
  
  “Erik’s team is in Boston and they’ve been monitoring the situation, but they haven’t found anything. We considered the possibility that the deaths could have been caused by a rogue wolf, but the werewolves would have dealt with it by now.”  
  
  I rubbed my jaw. “Erik’s good. If he can’t find any leads, what makes you think I can?”  
  
  Tristan smiled. “Because you are the best at finding things when no one else can.”  
  
  “Now you’re just trying to butter me up.”  
  
  “Is it working?”  
  
  “Maybe.” He had piqued my curiosity, and he knew it. Mysterious disappearances in a quiet place like Portland, that was the kind of job I couldn’t resist. “I’m sure Chris won’t mind waiting a week or so to visit Longstone.”  
  
  “Good.” He clasped his hands together. “Perhaps you should take a team with you, just in case.”  
  
  I laughed at his not-so-subtle attempt to get me to comply with the Council’s wishes. “I don’t think that’ll be necessary. I’m sure this is nothing Chris and I haven’t handled before.”  
  
  “Famous last words, my friend.”  
  
  The corner of my mouth lifted. “You’ll see. We’ll be in and out of Maine in no time.”  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  “Looks quiet here, Nikolas.”  
  
  I glanced at Chris and went back to studying the occupants of the club. He was right. This crowd was mostly college students who were more interested in dancing and hooking up than doing something nefarious. But Intel had identified this club as a place of interest because it was close to where the teenage girl had disappeared last Saturday. And our guys were rarely wrong.  
  
  “Let’s give it another ten minutes, and then we’ll head out.”  
  
  Chris nodded and turned away to do another slow circuit of the room. “I’ll meet you back here in ten.”  
  
  I leaned against the wall, ignoring the restlessness plaguing me since we’d arrived at the club an hour ago. Five days in Portland without a lead on the vampires who’d taken those four girls. The vampires were still in the city; of that I was certain. There’d been several other deaths since we’d arrived in town, vagrants who did not make the five o’clock news. These vampires were good at staying out of sight even as they made their presence known. What I wanted to know was what had brought them to Portland, and why were they still here?  
  
  My thoughts were interrupted by an attractive blonde who approached me wearing an inviting smile.  
  
  “Hi. Want to dance?”  
  
  I stared at the girl, not because of her question, but because my demon suddenly stirred as it detected the presence of another Mori. Chris was too far away for it to be him, so that left the blonde girl. But she was young, and there was no way a Mohiri teenager would be out alone in a club. Plus, we had no strongholds in Maine.  
  
  The sensation began to fade, and my eyes were drawn instead to a dark-haired girl passing behind the blonde. I could only see the other girl’s back before she entered the ladies’ restroom, but she looked young. I watched the door, waiting for her to reappear.  
  
  The blonde girl made a sound, reminding me of her invitation to dance. I declined and went back to watching the restroom, not wanting to miss the dark-haired girl when she came out. As far as I knew, there were no female warriors working in Portland at the moment. So why would one of them be here, partying with human college students? And why was she here without her team, especially with all the vampire activity in the area?  
  
  A few minutes later, I frowned when the restroom door opened and the girl came out. She was younger than I’d expected, and pretty. She wore little makeup, and there was something about her expression, a wary innocence that made her look out of place here. She was too young to be a warrior and too old to be an orphan. Obviously human.  
  
  Behind the girl, two blondes left the restroom arguing loudly. The brunette shook her head and gave an eye roll that made the corner of my mouth twitch. I was curious about her even though she was not Mohiri as I’d suspected, and I watched her stop to let the other women pass her.  
  
  One of the blondes screamed an obscenity and gave her companion a shove just as they moved past the girl. Her friend stumbled backward, flailing her arms and colliding with the dark-haired girl. I took a step away from the wall as the two of them fell. The girl hit the floor hard, and I heard her grunt in pain as the heavier blonde landed on top of her.  
  
  I started toward them as a man grabbed the blonde’s arms and lifted her off the girl.  
  
  “Is she all right?” someone asked when I reached the girl and looked down at her dazed expression.  
  
  I bent and waved a hand in front of her face. “Are you okay?”  
  
  She blinked and tried to sit up. “Um, I think so,” she replied in a low, husky voice that made my breath catch.  
  
  I reached for her hand to help her up, and as soon as our fingers touched, a warm tingle shot through mine. My Mori quivered with recognition and…excitement? There was no doubt in my mind that the girl was Mohiri. But how was that possible? How was I able to sense her one minute and not in the next? And how could I have gotten this close to her and not sensed anything until we touched? Most importantly, what was she doing here instead of living in a stronghold?  
  
  The girl dropped my hand and looked up at me, her cheeks pink and her full lips parted in a timid smile. Her eyes met mine, and I sucked in a sharp breath as I stared into beautiful green eyes framed by long dark lashes. If the eyes truly are the windows to the soul then I knew I was looking at one of the purest souls I had ever seen. I was only dimly aware of my Mori pressing forward and the strange fluttering sensation coming from the demon. All I could focus on was the feeling that I’d somehow met this girl before, even though I knew it was impossible. I never would have forgotten those eyes or that face.  
  
  Realizing we were only inches apart, I took a step back. She looked away, and I felt strangely bereft and more than a little confused by my reaction to her. I’d seen thousands of beautiful women in my life, and not one of them had drawn me in the way this slip of a girl did.  
  
  Her eyes lifted to mine again, and she smiled. “Sorry, I must have banged my head harder than I thought.”  
  
  The wave of emotions that slammed into me nearly drove me to my knees. Something base and primal welled up inside my chest, and I was gripped by an almost uncontrollable need to touch the girl.  
  
  What the hell? I clenched my teeth as I fought the insane urge as well as my agitated Mori. I hadn’t lost control of my demon since I was a child, and it shocked me to my core that I was fighting it now.  
  
  It took me several seconds to realize the girl had left, and I looked around in time to see her disappearing into the crowd.  
  
  Who is she? Mohiri, obviously, but what was she doing here alone? She was at least seventeen or eighteen – too old to be an orphan. More importantly, why were my Mori and I so damn affected by her?  
  
  Something caught the light at my feet, and I bent to pick it up. As soon as I touched the warm silver cross, I knew it was hers. The cross was old, and something told me she would be upset if she lost it.  
  
  It wasn’t hard to guess where she’d gone, and when I stepped out onto the deck, I found her alone at the rail, staring out into the night. She rubbed her temple, and I wondered if she had hurt herself when she fell.  
  
  The sight of her brought on another disturbing jumble of emotions – want, protectiveness, desire, fear – and I started to turn around and go back inside. I couldn’t deal with this now – whatever this was. I’d find Chris, have him talk to her and find out her story.  
  
  A soft sigh drew my attention back to the girl, and my gut clenched at how small and vulnerable she looked out here alone. Something about her tugged at me in a way I could not comprehend, and I found myself walking toward her.  
  
  “I believe this is yours.”  
  
  She gasped and spun, staring at the broken necklace hanging from my fingers. Her hand went to her neck, and then she reached for the necklace cautiously as if she half expect  
ed me to grab her.  
  
  “Thank you,” she said softly as she tucked it away in her pocket.  
  
  I studied her face, confused by what I was sensing and feeling. She was definitely Mohiri, of that I had no doubt, but her Mori was so quiet it seemed to be asleep. When two Mohiri get within a few feet of each other, our demons sense each other. My Mori was desperately trying to reach out to the girl’s Mori, but it wasn’t getting a response. I was mystified by my demon’s strong need to connect with this particular Mori, and by my own attraction to the girl.  
  
  “Are you done?”  
  
  Her blunt question shook me from my musings, and I stared at her in surprise. Tonight I had been approached and flirted with by more women than I could count, but this girl plainly wanted nothing to do with me. For some reason that thought did not sit well with me.  
  
  “You’re a bit young for this place,” I said sorely.  
  
  Her chin lifted. “I’m sorry but I don’t think that is any of your business.”  
  
  “You can’t be more than seventeen or eighteen,” I countered, intrigued by the emerald fire in her eyes. “You shouldn’t be here alone.”  
  
  “You’re not much older than me. And I’m not here alone.”  
  
  “I’m older than I look,” I replied, unsure if I was annoyed with her or myself for feeling this unreasonable swell of jealousy at her words. I didn’t know a thing about this girl; why should I care if she was here with another male?  
  
  I ran my hand through my hair and gave a silent groan of frustration. What the hell is wrong with me tonight?  
  
  “Nikolas,” called Chris, and I turned to see him in the doorway wearing an amused expression. “Ready to move out?”  
  
  “No,” I almost said, because I was suddenly reluctant to leave this mysterious girl who drew me like a moth to a flame. I didn’t even know her name, for Christ’s sake.  
  
  But I would. She was a young Mohiri out in a part of the city where vampires prowled. It was my duty to protect her and to discover who she was and what had brought her here. The glint in her eyes told me she was not going to be forthcoming with me if I asked her straight out. There was a wariness about her that said she did not trust easily.

*Discover the essential elements that transform ordinary relationships into extraordinary bonds*

## Introduction: The Universal Quest for Connection

In our fast-paced world, we often find ourselves wondering why some relationships flourish while others wither away. The secret lies in understanding four fundamental dimensions of human connection that have remained constant throughout history and will continue to be relevant for generations to come. These pillars form the foundation of every meaningful relationship, whether romantic, familial, or platonic.

## The Four Essential Dimensions of Connection

### 1. Physical Connection: The Power of Presence 🤗

Physical connection goes far beyond romantic intimacy. It encompasses:

**The Science of Touch**
Human beings are wired for physical contact. Research consistently shows that appropriate physical touch releases oxytocin, reducing stress and building trust. This dimension includes:

- **Proximity Matters**: Simply being in the same space creates bonds
- **Gentle Touch**: Handshakes, hugs, and supportive touches communicate care
- **Shared Experiences**: Activities that engage the senses together
- **Quality Time**: Undivided attention without digital distractions

**Daily Actions You Can Take:**
• Put away devices during conversations
• Offer appropriate physical comfort during difficult times
• Plan activities that involve shared physical experiences
• Practice being fully present in the moment

### 2. Intellectual Connection: Meeting of Minds 🧠

Mental stimulation creates lasting bonds through:

**Engaging Conversations**
The human mind craves understanding and intellectual challenge. This dimension thrives when:

- **Curiosity is Encouraged**: Asking thoughtful questions and listening actively
- **Ideas are Exchanged**: Sharing perspectives, dreams, and insights
- **Growth is Supported**: Encouraging each other's learning and development
- **Respect is Maintained**: Valuing different viewpoints without judgment

**Daily Actions You Can Take:**
• Ask open-ended questions about thoughts and opinions
• Share interesting articles, books, or discoveries
• Engage in problem-solving together
• Learn new skills or hobbies together

### 3. Emotional Connection: The Heart of Understanding ❤️

Emotional bonds form when people feel truly seen and valued:

**Creating Safe Spaces**
Emotional connection requires vulnerability and trust. Key elements include:

- **Active Listening**: Hearing not just words but emotions behind them
- **Validation**: Acknowledging feelings without trying to fix everything
- **Empathy**: Understanding experiences from another's perspective
- **Consistency**: Being reliable and trustworthy over time

**Daily Actions You Can Take:**
• Practice reflective listening without offering immediate solutions
• Express gratitude for specific qualities you appreciate
• Share your own authentic emotions appropriately
• Remember important events and follow up on them

### 4. Purposeful Connection: Shared Meaning and Values 🌱

This dimension involves alignment in life direction and personal growth:

**Building Something Together**
When people share common purposes and values, their connection deepens through:

- **Shared Goals**: Working toward common objectives
- **Value Alignment**: Respecting each other's core principles
- **Growth Partnership**: Supporting each other's personal development
- **Legacy Building**: Creating something meaningful together

**Daily Actions You Can Take:**
• Discuss long-term goals and aspirations
• Find volunteer opportunities or causes you both care about
• Celebrate each other's achievements and milestones
• Create traditions and memories that reflect shared values

## The Navigation Principle: Where to Invest Your Energy

### Recognizing Fertile Ground 🌿

Look for relationships where these connections naturally develop:

**Green Flags to Seek:**
- Mutual effort in building all four dimensions
- Natural flow of give-and-take
- Consistent growth and positive energy
- Respect for boundaries and individual growth

**Investment Strategies:**
- Nurture relationships that show promise in multiple dimensions
- Be patient with natural development timelines
- Communicate your needs clearly and kindly
- Celebrate progress in building deeper connections

### Identifying Barren Territory 🏜️

Some relationships may lack the foundation for these connections:

**Red Flags to Recognize:**
- One-sided effort despite clear communication
- Consistent dismissal of your needs across multiple dimensions
- Inability to grow or change over extended periods
- Fundamental incompatibility in values or life direction

**Healthy Boundaries:**
- Limit emotional investment in consistently unfulfilling relationships
- Redirect energy toward relationships with mutual potential
- Learn from experiences without becoming cynical
- Maintain self-respect while being compassionate

## Practical Implementation: Your Daily Connection Toolkit

### Morning Practices ☀️

Start each day with connection in mind:
- Send a thoughtful message to someone important
- Practice gratitude for relationships in your life
- Set intentions for meaningful interactions

### Throughout the Day 🌅

Integrate connection-building into routine activities:
- Give full attention during conversations
- Notice opportunities to offer support or encouragement
- Practice empathy in challenging interactions
- Look for shared experiences and learning opportunities

### Evening Reflection 🌙

End each day by:
- Reflecting on meaningful connections made
- Planning follow-up actions for important conversations
- Appreciating growth in existing relationships
- Setting intentions for tomorrow's interactions

---

## The Long-Term Vision: Building a Connected Life

### Quality Over Quantity

Focus on developing deep, meaningful relationships rather than maintaining numerous surface-level connections. A few relationships strong in all four dimensions will bring more fulfillment than many shallow ones.

### Personal Growth as Foundation

The strongest external connections often reflect our internal relationship with ourselves. Developing self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and personal values creates a solid foundation for connecting with others.

### Adaptation and Evolution

Relationships naturally change over time. The four dimensions may shift in importance or expression, but they remain relevant frameworks for understanding and nurturing human connection regardless of life stage or circumstances.

---

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Time Constraints ⏰
**Solution**: Focus on quality over quantity. Even brief interactions can strengthen connections when they engage these four dimensions meaningfully.

### Challenge 2: Fear of Vulnerability 😰
**Solution**: Start small with emotional sharing and gradually build trust. Vulnerability is a skill that develops with practice.

### Challenge 3: Different Communication Styles 🗣️
**Solution**: Learn to recognize and adapt to others' preferred ways of connecting while maintaining your authenticity.

### Challenge 4: Geographic Distance 🌍
**Solution**: Use technology creatively to maintain connections across all four dimensions, while prioritizing in-person time when possible.

---

## Conclusion: Your Connection Journey Starts Now

Building meaningful relationships through these four dimensions isn't about perfection—it's about intentional growth and genuine care. Every interaction offers an opportunity to strengthen bonds through physical presence, mental engagement, emotional understanding, and shared purpose.

Remember that you deserve relationships that fulfill you across all these dimensions. While it takes courage to seek deeper connections and wisdom to recognize when to redirect your energy, the rewards of meaningful relationships are immeasurable.

Your journey toward richer, more fulfilling relationships begins with a single step: choosing to be intentional about how you connect with others today.

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. The path to meaningful connection is always available, and it starts with your next interaction.

Hello! I was learning Blender for a while to make the art of my game, however each time I realized that it has a very high learning curve, to the point of having strong depressions due to the workload.

Reading other posts I realized that there were similar complaints, notes like ""I'd rather take 3 months in Blockbench than 6 years to learn how to use Blender"" made me want to give Blockbench a try, and I must say that, I loved it, I want to clarify that this is not some kind of glorification of the software, I just think that it could be useful for those who may also find the learning curve of Blender difficult.

I love Blender, and as a realist art artist I had to sacrifice that realism for a more humble art style, with more iteration and less polygon and combined with Godot's compatibility mode to reach a wider range of audience. And by playing with some lighting you can achieve amazing things like in the art pinned to this post.

UV mapping is much simpler, modeling is like manipulating and combining Legos, optimized meshes even if you make a mess, texturing is literally doing pixel art on top of the models and the animation, although limited, is enough.

I don't want to disparage Blender but if I wanted to make a movie or an animated short that would definitely be what I would use it for. I love how complete it is but perhaps that is exactly the problem, in my personal opinion it is not the right tool to do the job (unless you want to take 5-10 years).",18,1756408685.0,godot,2,0.95,False

I'm feeling a bit lonely and would love some company as I go about my day. I'm a huge yapper and am down to talk about almost any topic. I would prefer someone who gives me the same energy and loves to yap as well. I would prefer someone who loves to actively engage in conversation and doesn't make me feel like I'm interviewing them. If you have any niche or interesting hobbies/interests, feel free to yap away about them. I enjoy learning about people.

Here's two icebreaker questions those of you are shy or need a convo starter:

1. Are you a coffee person or a tea person? What's your go to order at your local cafe?

If you’ve ever tried selling a product online, you already know the truth: a static photo doesn’t always cut it. That’s why tools like *MagicShot.ai’s* [product-to-video](https://app.magicshot.ai/ai/video-generator/product-to-video) *feature* are making waves. They give brands, big or small, the ability to turn still images into dynamic, story-driven product videos without needing a film crew or a budget that makes your CFO's heart skip a beat.

But here’s the real question: why does video move the needle so much more than images?

# Why Video Converts Where Photos Fall Flat

Think about the last time you shopped online. Did you linger on a static photo? Or did you click play on the video to see how that product *actually feels* in action? Video triggers curiosity. It shows context, builds trust, and answers questions that pictures leave hanging.

* A mug isn’t just a mug; it’s steaming coffee on a cold morning.  
* A pair of running shoes isn’t just foam and laces; it’s the rhythm of feet hitting the pavement.  

That extra layer of *experience* is what flips a browser into a buyer.

# ROI: Where the Numbers Tell the Story

Marketers obsess over ROI because, well, what’s the point of creative effort if it doesn’t deliver? Product-to-video campaigns consistently outperform image-only ads across platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and even Amazon listings.

* **Higher engagement:** People stop scrolling when motion catches the eye.  
* **Better retention:** Customers remember what they see moving.  
* **Improved conversions:** Videos build the confidence needed to hit “add to cart.”  

The twist? You don’t need Hollywood production values. A short, sharp product demo or lifestyle clip often outshines a glossy, overproduced ad.

# Where to Put Product Videos (and Why)

1. **TikTok & Reels:** These platforms thrive on quick, relatable content. Adding your product to the video here makes your brand feel part of the culture, not just an ad.  
2. **Amazon Listings:** Amazon’s own numbers show that products with video get higher conversion rates. It’s simple, buyers want proof in motion.  
3. **Retargeting Ads:** Someone browsed your product but didn’t buy? A product video can tip them over the line.  

The trick isn’t just making a video; it’s making it feel native to the platform where it lives. A polished YouTube explainer won’t resonate the same way a snappy TikTok does.

# Simple Product Video Tricks That Work

* Show your product *in use*, not just floating on a white background.  
* Keep it short; aim for 15–30 seconds.  
* Lead with movement; get something happening in the first two seconds.  
* Use captions. Most people scroll with sound off.  
* Test multiple edits. A subtle change in pace or text overlay can double engagement.  

These aren’t fancy secrets; they’re the fundamentals. But the brands that stick to them consistently see returns climb.

# The Bigger Picture

Product-to-video campaigns aren’t just about conversions. They’re about brand presence. They help you tell micro-stories that stick in your audience’s memory. When your product *feels alive* in someone’s feed, they don’t just recognize it; they start imagining it in their own life.

Review Inside!,"The **MÜELLERHOME DC-550x Pink Drip Coffee Maker** became a recent addition to my kitchen lineup, and I've been testing it daily in an attempt to determine if this was the right upgrade to my brewing routine. While it’s clear this machine brings a lot to the table, there are some quirks worth discussing. Let's dive into the details of this eye-catching pink drip coffee maker and my honest experience using it.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this coffee machine was the design. Its vibrant pink color isn’t just unique; it screams personality for anyone tired of the usual black-and-silver kitchen appliances. Beyond aesthetics, the build feels sturdy. The borosilicate glass carafe stands out for its heat resistance and its generous 60oz capacity, offering up to 12 cups of coffee in one brew. It’s perfect for when I have guests or I’m just in *desperate need of caffeine overload*, as my friends often joke. Its easy-grip handle ensures no accidental spills, which—trust me—is something I’ve learned to appreciate during rushed mornings when coordination isn’t at its peak.

**Ease of Use and Operation**  
Operating this device is as straightforward as it gets. This is a fully automated drip coffee maker, so even my coffee-challenged cousin managed to brew her morning cup without any hiccups. Its reusable eco-filter was a definite perk I didn’t know I needed. Not only does it eliminate the need for disposable filters, saving money and reducing waste, but it also delivers surprisingly rich coffee flavor. However, a tip based on my experience: if you’re ridiculously picky about coffee sediment, adding a paper filter in addition to the reusable one may help.

**Temperature Consistency**  
What impressed me the most was the thermal consistency of this machine. The keep-warm function has been a lifesaver—like when I brewed coffee for my virtual meeting break, only to remember an hour later that my coffee was still sitting there. It remained warm and flavorful even after an hour, which is something not all coffee makers pull off well. On busier days, the automatic 2-hour shutoff feature is both a convenience and a safety assurance. Life gets hectic, and it’s comforting knowing I’m not about to accidentally set my kitchen on fire.

**Upsides**  
- Gorgeous and unique pink design, adding flair to the kitchen.  
- Reusable and eco-friendly filter saves money over time.  
- Generous 12-cup capacity with easy-drip, spill-free design.  
- Effective keep-warm function with auto-shutoff for safety.    

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The machine is slightly bulkier than expected and takes up counter space.  
- Some users, myself included, might prefer a slightly hotter brewing temperature, though this is a subjective point.  
- While the reusable filter is a blessing, cleaning it thoroughly takes a touch of patience.  

**Competitive Options**  
If you’re shopping within the same category, there are several worthy competitors to consider. The Cuisinart Perfectemp Drip Coffee Maker, for example, offers a similar large carafe capacity and comes with customizable brew temperature settings—something missing in this model. On the flip side, I found that the Cuisinart’s price point tends to be higher without adding much stylistic flair. The Black+Decker 12-Cup Drip Coffee Maker also competes well due to its affordability and compact size, but it lacks the reusable filter and borosilicate glass carafe that this coffee maker offers. Where the **MÜELLERHOME DC-550x Pink Drip Coffee Maker** excels is in its balance of eco-conscious options and striking design, which its competitors can’t quite match.

**Cost Efficiency**  
After evaluating the features against other models in the same category, it’s evident that this machine lands in a middle ground between budget-friendly and premium options. For the features offered—eco-filter, keep-warm technology, borosilicate carafe, and its automatic functionality—it’s definitely worth the investment if you value aesthetics and utility equally. The reusable filter alone tips the scales in terms of financial value as it eliminates recurring costs of paper filters.

  A vacation without parents is like a chocolate brownie without the nuts -- absolutely perfect!  
  
  Hi my name is Amy Nelson-Barak. My mom is a Nelson and my dad is a Barak and just in case you were wondering, I'm aware I have two last names. If you don't know me, I'm a seventeen-year-old American teenager with red, white and blue blood running through my veins. You're probably wondering why right now I'm on a bus in Israel on my way to an Israeli military boot camp.  
  
  Yes, I did say I'm in Israel. No need to rub your eyes and reread that.  
  
  And yes, I did say boot camp.  
  
  And before you think it's a boot camp for teens with behavioral disorders, I volunteered for this summer program all on my own. (Although my parents often accuse me of being a total drama queen, I don't think that counts as a true behavior disorder. ) My friends signed up, too. Normally I wouldn't go anywhere near a program with the word ""military"" in it, especially during the summer between my junior and senior years of high school, but when I realized what military base the boot camp is held at, I jumped to sign up--as a volunteer trainee.  
  
  You see, my boyfriend Avi is Israeli. He's in the IDF-- Israeli Defense Force--and since I live in the good ol' US of A (Chicago, to be exact), I haven't seen him since he visited me over five months ago. He's a commando, he's nineteen years old, and is just about the hottest, most gorgeous gift God has ever put on this planet. And he's all mine. Well, to be technical, the Israeli military owns his body until he turns twenty-one, but I own his heart. And he owns mine.  
  
  So I got this letter from Avi a few months back. He told me that after parachute training he's going to be at Base Nesher. He said if I was visiting Israel this summer, unfortunately he didn't think he could get any time off.  
  
  Then, when my best friend Jessica, along with this girl Miranda and my best guy friend Nathan (who I kissed once. . . okay, three times. . . but we're just friends), told me they were signing up for a program in Israel that included ten days in basic training boot camp, I laughed at them. I mean, what kind of idiot would go to a military boot camp on purpose?  
  
  But guess what? It's at Base Nesher--the same base Avi is at! When I figured that out, I begged my father to sign me up. I haven't told Avi that I'm coming--it's a surprise. I can't wait to see his reaction when he sees me. He's going to be as excited as I am!  
  
  I'm so thankful this bus is air conditioned and we have big, cushioned seats for the three-hour ride. We're on the bus with forty other American teens (half are girls, half are guys). The trip is called Sababa, which translates to ""cool, awesome, a great way of life"" or something like that. The tour starts out with the boot camp, then the rest of the summer is spent exploring and touring the country.  
  
  The director of the Sababa program gave me special permission to sign up for the boot camp portion of the trip only, because after boot camp I'll be staying at my aunt and uncle's house on their moshav (kinda like a community farm) in the Golan Heights. So I'll be with family while Miranda, Nathan, and Jessica spend the rest of the summer on the Sababa tour.  
  
  ""Amy, I think Miranda is gonna puke,"" Nathan tells me. He's sitting next to Miranda, who has had anxiety about the boot camp part of the vacation. She's been stressing about it since we took the plane from Chicago to Tel Aviv (with a ridiculously long layover in New York). Miranda's a tad bit, uh, I don't know how to say this in a politically correct way. . . let's just say she's in the upper sixtieth percentile on the weight chart hanging in the nurse's office at our high school. (Probably closer to the seventy-fifth, but who's counting. ) She's afraid they're going to ration her food at boot camp and make her run until her extra, overflowing muffin-top disappears.  
  
  I lean over my best friend Jessica, who's blocking my view of Miranda. ""Miranda, it's not going to be like Camp Meltaway. I promise. ""  
  
  Mirandas parents sent her to a fat farm between seventh and eighth grade and she's never gotten over it. The girl cannot survive on granola for snack food. Believe it or not, during her second week at Camp Meltaway, meek and timid Miranda got caught trying to hitchhike into town in search of fast food.  
  
  Miranda smiles a little at the sight of a candy bar I pulled from my backpack. Seriously, one day I'll teach her that moderation is ""the key"" to weight loss. She can have a candy bar every day. . . just not three of them in one sitting.  
  
  Now for me, personally, if I could only get ""the key"" to smaller boobs (without surgery, since I'm not a fan of getting my little pinky parts cut off and reattached, thank you very much), I'd be the first in line. Yes siree, we all have our little personal issues, things we'd like to change or need to change about ourselves.  
  
  ""I brought extra Kit Kats,"" I say, holding up the candy bar. Okay, so the label says Kif-Kaf 'in Hebrew, but it's the same thing.  
  
  Jessica slaps my hand down. ""Don't show her that. ""  
  
  ""Why not?""  
  
  ""Because she wants to lose weight, Amy. Don't sabotage her. ""  
  
  I roll my eyes. Sometimes my best friend has to be enlightened. ""Jess, you heard Nathan. Miranda is so scared she's about to puke. I'm just trying to comfort her. ""  
  
  ""So comfort her with words and friendship, not candy bars,"" Jess whispers. ""That stuff is poison. ""  
  
  Is she kidding me? Chocolate is my favorite comfort food. Well, it's actually #2 because everybody knows sushi is at the top of my list. Not all sushi, just spicy tuna rolls with little pieces of tempura crunch inside. Nothing, not even chocolate, beats that.  
  
  I rummage through my backpack. ""Have you seen these? I say, creating suspense as I slowly pull out a Kif-Kaf bar wrapped in a white package instead of the usual red one. ""It's a Kit Kat bar in white chocolate, Jess. They were almost sold out at the store, but I found this one lonely package mixed in with the regular ones. I know you love white chocolate as much as I do. "" I wave it in front of her nose. ""Smell the white chocolate. . . crave the white chocolate. ""  
  
  ""I can't smell anything. It's still in the wrapper. ""  
  
  ""I'm saving it for a special occasion. ""  
  
  Before I can stick my rare white chocolate find back in the special zippered compartment in my backpack, Nathan reaches across the bus aisle and snatches the Kif-Kaf out of my hand. ""Cool, white chocolate Kit Kat. I've always wanted to try one of those. Thanks!""  
  
  ""Give that back!"" I yell.  
  
  Nathan, who is a total and complete dufus 90 percent of the time, rips the package open and takes a huge bite from the top. He doesn't even snap off one of the four sticks like any normal, decent person would do. No, he bites a quarter off the top, so now all the bars have a chunk out of them. ""Damn, that's good. ""  
  
  My mouth is open wide in shock. ""I can't believe you just did that. ""  
  
  ""What?""  
  
  ""First of all, I was just telling Jess I'm saving it for a special occasion. I only have one white chocolate, and you. . . you. . . you. . . "" I can't even express how pissed I am at him.  
  
  Nathan shrugs, then holds out the rest of the uneaten bar. ""Here, you want a bite?""  
  
  Yuck! ""You bit off the whole top. You're supposed to snap off the sticks one at a time. Everyone knows that. Now the entire thing is tainted with your saliva germs. ""  
  
  ""Come on, Amy. You've been exposed to my saliva germs before. "" He makes a smooching noise, then grins. ""So what's the big deal?""  
  
  I pretend to gag. ""Don't remind me. ""  
  
  You probably think I hate Nathan. I don't. Next to Jessica, he's my best friend and the most entertaining thing I have in my life, especially when Avi and I are apart. Nathan is like my very own live Elmo doll that walks, talks, and farts. Maybe that isn't the greatest analogy, but you get the idea.  
  
  ""I'll have a bit  
e,"" Miranda sheepishly chimes in, leaning toward the half-eaten chocolate.  
  
  Nathan sticks his tongue out at me and moves the chocolate closer to Miranda. She takes a bite, then Nathan finishes it off by popping the rest in his mouth. Miranda can be my guest and swap germs with Nathan all she wants.  
  
  ""You owe me another Kif-Kaf"" I tell him. ""A white chocolate one. ""  
  
  ""Whatever,"" he says, licking his fingers one by one, making those little sucking sounds on each one to annoy me.  
  
  ""Keep doin' that, big guy. You forget that my strong, military commando boyfriend will kick your butt once I tell him you mutilated my white Kit Kat without my permission. ""  
  
  Nathan stops licking his fingers. ""Seriously, tell that guy to stay away from me. I think I still have bruise marks on my face in the shape of his fist. ""  
  
  ""Avi only hit you because you attacked him first,"" I remind him.  
  
  ""You told me to, Amy,"" Nathan says defensively. ""You know, during your stupid Operation Get-Avi-Back on the Northwestern campus. ""  
  
  Nathan's right--but it was only to stall Avi so I could let him know I was devastated we broke up during his trip to Chicago. I was desperate to get back together. It wasn't a stupid plan. It was brilliant, especially because it worked. ""Well, that's old news. Avi doesn't even remember you. ""  
  
  Okay, so that's not exactly true. Sometimes Avi will ask about Nathan when we talk on the phone. He knows Nathan and I kissed. . . he doesn't know it was three times, though. To be completely honest, the first time was awful, the third time was fake (it was actually last month--to make his ex-girlfriend Bicky believe he was dating me so she'd stop dropping into his life), but the second time. . .  
  
  I don't want to think about that second time. So Nathan knows how to kiss when he puts a little effort into it. It's not a big deal.  
  
  It doesn't matter, anyway. Avi is the only guy I ever want to kiss. He knows nearly everything about me (of course, he's never heard me on the toilet because I run the water when I'm in the bathroom, and he has no clue I have a fear of spiders), and the guy still loves me. My dad warns me not to wait around for him, because he's in Israel and we have a long-distance relationship. He also says we're too young to say we'll be together forever.  
  
  As if my dad knows about love. My dad is single and has just started dating Maria, the woman who runs the coffee shop in the building next to our condo. I admit I set them up. . . one night I invited her over, and when my dad came home I had Nathan come up with an excuse to get me out of there so they could have some alone-time. The rest is history; at least, it will be when my dad decides to ask Maria to marry him. Then I won't have to worry that he'll be without a partner the rest of his life.  
  
  The bus comes to a stop and I glance out the window. The security checkpoint, the gates, and the soldiers in green military uniforms clue me in that we've finally arrived at the base. Almost everywhere you go in Israel, you see someone in a military uniform and most have a rifle strapped to their backs.  
  
  I've only been to Israel once before (although this will be my first time on a military base) and I'm already desensitized to seeing military personnel everywhere I go, from the mall (they check your purse before you go inside to make sure you're not carrying an illegal bomb or weapon) to tourist and religious sites. They even have a security guy stationed outside the grocery store. It's totally different back home in Chicago. While the abundance of military presence in Israel isn't what I'm used to, it makes me feel tremendously safe.  
  
  I'll have to remember to pray for the day Israelis don't have to worry about war or terrorism. I also have to pray they can make some sort of peace with their neighbors, because I'm a huge ""let's make love, not war"" kind of person.  
Speaking of love. . . I look out the window and crane my neck to see if I can spot Avi. No such luck.  
  
  Pulling out my makeup case, I tell Jess to hold up the mirror so I can brush on more blush and fix any smudged eyeliner. Then I hold up the mirror for Jess so she can do the same.  
  
  ""What are you girls doing?"" Nathan asks, laughing.  
  
  ""Fixing ourselves. ""  
  
  ""This isnt a beauty pageant, you know. Its the IDF. ""  
  
  ""We know,"" Jess says, dipping the lip gloss applicator in the tube and applying it to her lips. ""But who says just because youre in the army you have to look like crap?""  
  
  ""Seriously, Nathan. Dont you know anything about girls?""  
  
  ""Apparently not. "" He turns to Miranda and puts his hands in a praying position. ""Dont be like them, okay?""  
  
  ""I like the way they look,"" Miranda tells him. ""If I was as pretty as them, Id do the same. ""  
  
  He slaps his palm against his forehead. ""I cannot believe what Im hearing. Miranda, youre fine as-is. "" Great, Nathan, treat her as if shes a defective as-is item sold on the clearance rack.  
  
  ""Miranda, I need makeup to look good,"" I tell her. ""Youre naturally pretty. ""  
  
  When the bus passes through the checkpoint, my heart starts racing. I wonder when well have free time to explore the base so I can search for Avi.  
  
  ""Dont volunteer for anything,"" a guy in the seat behind us whispers through the space between the seats. ""Pass it down. ""  
  
  I pass the message down.  
  
  ""I heard if you volunteer, youll be stuck doing some crappy assignment,"" Jess says.  
  
  Note taken. I will not volunteer. I have a major aversion to crappy assignments.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  Why couldnt God have given humans doggie sweat glands, so we could gracefully pant our sweat away?  
  
  Our military leaders, or hamefakedm Hebrew (if you say it fast it sounds like Im a \[insert cuss word\]), are named Ronit and Susu. Theyre both Israeli, both in the military, and their crappy assignment is being in charge of us during boot camp. Susu is in charge of the twenty guys and Ronit is in charge of the twenty girls.  
  
  Ronit stands next to the bus driver with her clipboard in hand. ""Girls, please find your suitcases and follow me to the bittan. Boys, follow Susu. ""  
  
  We gather our backpacks and file off the bus.  
  
  ""If theyre gonna separate the guys from the girls, can we at least have co-ed showers?"" Nathan mumbles.  
  
  ""Youre a pig,"" I tell him.  
  
  ""Shh, dont say the word pig so loud, Amy,"" Nathan whispers in my ear. ""Pigs arent kosher, you know. ""  
  
  ""Whatever, Nathan. Its not like Im gonna eat it. I just said it. ""  
  
  Some of the stronger American guys from our trip are unloading our luggage. I would be searching for my luggage, but Im too consumed with Avi-scanning and fanning my face with my hand because its so hot outside.  
  
  Youd think Gods holy land wouldnt be as hot as hell, but it is.  
  
  ""Find your luggage fast, ladies!"" Ronits voice booms from behind us. ""And follow me!""  
  
  ""Does she have to be so cheery all the time?"" Jess asks. ""Its irritating. ""  
  
  ""Maybe she loves her job,"" Miranda chimes in.  
  
  I snort, on purpose. ""Maybe shes got a personality disorder. ""  
  
  I watch as Nathan joins the other guys following Susu. I have to give major credit to Nathan for always fitting in as ""one of the guys. "" Hes never an outcast or out of place, because everyone likes him. Its a trait that totally annoys someone like me--I only feel comfortable with people who know me.  
  
  I spot my hot pink luggage that I bought for my trip. One big rolling suitcase and one smaller one. My father wanted me to buy a dorky duffel or some boring luggage that had been ""rated highly"" (my dads words, not mine) by Consumer Reports, but Id axed that suggestion because the only colors available were black and black with dark gray trim. I have one word to describe them: BOR-ING!  
  
  I want my luggage to reflect my personality. And Im anything but boring. I pull out the handles to my girlie suitcases and start wheeling them away from the others.  
  
  Ronit holds her hand high in the air and says, ""Follow me, girls!"" as she heads down the road. ""Yala, zooz! Hurry!""  
  
  Most of the girls in our group are lugging duffels (okay, I admit the brochure might have recommended them, but itd be impossible to shove all my stuff in a duffel. . . and Id never be able to carry it even if I could). How these girls can fit their necessities into one bag is beyond me.  
  
  Miranda, Jessica, and I are lagging behind. I mean, come on. . . who can hurry when its so damn hot outside? Jessica has two pink suitcases, just like me, but hers have huge rhinestone/diamond studs spelling out JESSICA across the side. Miranda only has one painfully boring black suitcase. The poor girl is sweating so much there are wet spots in the shape of half-moons under her boobs.  
  
  ""I think Im going to die,"" Miranda says, yanking a portable fan out of her suitcase and hanging it around her neck. ""Where are the barracks?""  
  
  I would feel sorry for her, except my boobs have the same half-moon wet spots and I dont have a portable fan.  
  
  Chapter 3  
  
  Everything from your sunglasses to your suitcase should reflect your unique style and attitude.  
  
  With my designer sunglasses protecting my eyes, my backpack on my back, and a suitcase rolling in each hand, Im walking slowly down the road. Were passing offices and off-white buildings made out of cement. Im painfully aware of the many Israeli soldiers pointing to the three of us and snickering.  
  
  Yes, gawk at the American girls struggling with their luggage, I want to say, but dont. We must look totally out of place with our Abercrombie outfits and pimped-out suitcases. Listen, I dont blame them for laughing. Im definitely out of my element.  
  
  I silently pray for Avi to come to my rescue and take my luggage to the barracks for me.  
  
  Sweat rolls down my forehead. Where is my boyfriend? And how big is this army base anyway?  
  
  ""Come on, girls!"" Ronit urges from far down the road.  
  
  Jess puts on a huge fake smile and waves to our leader. ""Were coming!"" she says, mimicking Ronit s cheery tone. Jess and I know shes making fun of Ronit, but I doubt anyone else does. ""Dont they have a bellman?"" She wipes her upper lip thats beading with sweat. ""They better have air-conditioned rooms. I just got my lip waxed and dont have anything for the sweat to cling to. ""  
  
  ""Ugh, TMI,"" I tell her.  
  
  ""Its true, Amy. Do you have another portable fan with you, Miranda?""  
  
  She shakes her head.  
  
  I look left and right to see if I can catch a glimpse of my boyfriend. ""Avi has got to be around here somewhere, right?""  
  
  Jess sighs. She misses Tarik, her boyfriend. Hes Palestinian, and although hes not thrilled about her spending part of her summer on an Israeli military base, he understands her commitment to her religion because he feels the same about his.  
  
  Jessica is Jewish and Tarik is Muslim. Youd think theyd avoid each other like I avoid political debates, but ever since they met theyve chosen to ignore the obvious obstacles in their relationship. So who am I to bring it up? Im a huge fan of living in ignorant bliss.  
  
  Im wondering when this lugging-luggage torture will be over. My suitcases are kicking up dust from the gravel road. Now Im not only sweaty, but dirty too. I pull harder. Visions of a hot shower with my papaya-scented bath gel and a nice relaxing nap on a featherbed dance in my brain. Suddenly, I hear a snap and watch one of the wheels on my beautiful, designer, hot-pink suitcase roll away from me and bounce to the bottom of a ditch. I suck in a horrified breath.  
  
  Chapter 4  
  
  It boggles my mind that theres a direct correlation between lack of quality and bling.  
  
  At least in the suitcase department.  
  
  ""Whoa, that sucks,"" Jess says slowly.  
  
  Miranda points to the offending wheel. ""Amy, is that yours?""  
  
  ""Yep. "" So now I have a broken piece of luggage and Im still not at our barracks.  
  
  I swallow my ego and start walking towar  
d the stupid broken wheel. I eye it in the ditch where it stopped. Im wearing a pink tank and white jean shorts, and I know if I slip as I go down Im going to have dirt all over me. Oh, dont go blaming me about wearing white shorts. . . climbing down into a ditch to retrieve a stupid wheel wasnt exactly one of the warnings in the Sababa brochure.  
  
  I take one step down. My foot slides a little, then stops.  
  
  I probably should tell you now that Im wearing these really cute pink mules that arent really made for traction--but they sure do match my tank perfectly. Im not about to take out the gym shoes I bought for this trip, because theyre at the bottom of one of my suitcases.  
  
  I take another step, and wobble because Im walking on an angle.  
  
  ""Be careful,"" Miranda warns.  
  
  Before I take another step, a boy in uniform walks up to us. ""Mah karah? he asks. Hes got short hair and beautiful olive skin without a trace of acne.  
  
  ""Angleet, bvakashah,"" I say. My dad taught me that phrase, which means ""English, please. ""  
  
  ""You need help?"" He has a big Israeli accent along with a big Israeli smile (hes also got a big Israeli rifle slung on his back).  
  
  ""Desperately,"" I admit, pointing to the wheel.  
  
  He scrambles down the bank as if he does it every day of his life, and picks up the wheel. On his way back up, he grabs my elbow and helps me back to the gravel road. Then attempts to reattach the wheel.  
  
  ""This suitcase is a piece of sheet,"" he informs me. ""It cant be fixed. "" He hands me the plastic wheel. I almost laugh at the word ""sheet""--American profanity with an Israeli accent comes out really funny. But Im sweaty and unhappy and cannot physically laugh right now.  
  
  I shove the wheel in the front pocket of my suitcase. ""Well, thanks for trying. ""  
  
  ""Yeah, thanks,"" Miranda chimes in.  
  
  The guy holds out his hand. ""Im Nimrod. ""  
  
  ""No, really, whats your name?"" I ask.  
  
  ""Nimrod. ""  
  
  He did not just say Nimrod, did he? With the Israeli accent it sounds like Nim-road.  
  
  I put my sunglasses on top of my head, eyeing him suspiciously. ""Nimrodi""  
  
  ""Nimrod. I guess in America this is not a popular name, no?""  
  
  Jess is trying not to laugh. Miranda just looks confused. Some names in Israel do not translate to English well. Avi has friends named Doo-Doo, Moron, and Odead. And my cousins name is pronounced Osnot.  
  
  ""Im Amy. And this is Jessica and Miranda,"" I say, pointing to each of my friends.  
  
  Nimrod heaves the entire suitcase up into his arms. ""Your group is at the bittan on the other side of the hill. Ill help you. ""  
  
  ""Thanks,"" I say, noting that my hot pink suitcase looks very out of place in Nimrods arms and I still have no clue what a bittan is. I roll my smaller suitcase behind him. As we pass other soldiers, they make comments in Hebrew to Nimrod, who laughs and shrugs as he leads us up the hill.  
  
  The guy isnt breaking a sweat in this heat, which is not normal. Looking around, I notice that none of the Israeli soldiers milling around are sweating. It makes me wonder if Israelis are born without sweat glands.  
  
  ""Where are you girls from?"" Nimrod asks.  
  
  ""Chicago,"" I say.

## 💰 The Leverage Revolution: Why Some People Earn 10x More

Ever wonder why your colleague makes ten times your salary while seemingly working the same hours? The answer lies in **leverage**. 

Think of leverage as your ability to multiply your efforts. While you might be trading time for money, high earners have discovered ways to make their work compound. This could mean:

- Creating systems that work without constant supervision
- Building skills that solve expensive problems
- Developing relationships that open doors to opportunities
- Learning to delegate and multiply your impact through others

**Daily Action:** Start documenting your repetitive tasks this week. Ask yourself: ""How can I systemize this?"" or ""Who else could handle this while I focus on higher-value activities?""

## 🎯 The Focus Factor: Your Attention is Your Superpower

In our hyperconnected world, your ability to focus deeply has become a rare and valuable skill. Every notification, every social media scroll, every random YouTube video is literally rewiring your brain for distraction.

Research shows that it takes an average of 23 minutes to fully refocus after an interruption. If you're getting interrupted every few minutes throughout your day, you're essentially operating in a constant state of mental fog.

**Daily Action:** Try the ""phone in another room"" experiment for just two hours daily. Notice how your productivity and mental clarity improve when you're not constantly fighting the urge to check your device.

## 🗣️ Choose Your Advisors Wisely

You wouldn't take swimming lessons from someone who's afraid of water. Yet many people regularly seek advice from individuals who haven't achieved what they're trying to accomplish.

This doesn't mean you should only listen to millionaires or celebrities. It means being selective about whose guidance you value for specific areas of your life.

**Daily Action:** Before accepting advice, ask yourself: ""Has this person successfully navigated the challenge I'm facing?"" If not, thank them politely and seek guidance elsewhere.

## 🏆 You Are Your Own Hero

Perhaps the hardest truth to accept is that no external force is coming to solve your problems. Not your family, not your employer, not the government, not luck.

This isn't pessimistic—it's empowering. When you fully accept responsibility for your outcomes, you gain the power to change them.

**Daily Action:** Replace ""I have to"" with ""I choose to"" in your daily language. Notice how this simple shift changes your sense of control over your circumstances.

## 📚 Action Beats Information Every Time

The self-improvement industry thrives on selling you the next book, course, or seminar. But here's what they don't tell you: you probably already know enough to dramatically improve your life.

The gap isn't in your knowledge—it's in your execution.

**Daily Action:** Pick one thing you know you should be doing but aren't. Start doing it today, even imperfectly. Progress trumps perfection every single time.

## 💼 The 90-Day Career Transformation

Unless you're in a field requiring extensive certification (medicine, law, engineering), you can probably increase your earning potential faster by learning sales than by going back to school.

Every business needs people who can attract customers, solve problems, and generate revenue. These skills transfer across industries and often pay better than traditional career paths.

**Daily Action:** Practice explaining the value of something you love (a product, service, or idea) to someone who's never heard of it. This builds your communication and persuasion muscles.

## 🌟 Embrace Your Invisibility

Here's liberating news: most people are too busy thinking about themselves to judge you as harshly as you imagine. This fear of judgment keeps countless people stuck in mediocrity.

**Daily Action:** Do one thing this week that you've been avoiding due to fear of what others might think. Start that conversation, share that idea, or take that calculated risk.

## 🤝 Collaboration Over Competition

When you meet someone more skilled than you, your first instinct might be intimidation or competition. Instead, look for ways to collaborate, learn, or contribute to their success.

Smart, successful people often become valuable connections when approached with genuine curiosity rather than competitive energy.

**Daily Action:** Identify one person in your field who knows more than you do. Reach out with a thoughtful question or offer to help with something they're working on.

## 🚭 Eliminate Performance Killers

Some habits offer zero upside while significantly impacting your mental clarity and focus. The most obvious culprits are substances that affect your brain chemistry.

Your cognitive performance is your most valuable asset in today's economy. Anything that diminishes it is working against your long-term success.

**Daily Action:** Honestly assess which habits in your life provide no real benefit while potentially harming your mental sharpness. Consider eliminating or reducing them.

## 😰 Comfort is a Trap

The human brain is wired to seek comfort and avoid discomfort. This served our ancestors well when survival was the primary concern. Today, this same wiring can keep you trapped in situations that feel safe but limit your growth.

Most meaningful achievements require temporary discomfort. Learning new skills, building relationships, creating businesses—all involve uncertainty and challenge.

**Daily Action:** Identify one area of your life where you've gotten too comfortable. Take a small step outside that comfort zone this week.

## 🤐 Guard Your Privacy

In our oversharing culture, the ability to keep information to yourself has become both rare and powerful. You don't owe anyone access to your thoughts, plans, or personal details.

Selective sharing allows you to maintain control over your narrative and protects you from unnecessary criticism or interference.

**Daily Action:** Before sharing personal information, ask yourself: ""Does this person need to know this?"" If not, keep it to yourself.

## 🍷 Protect Your Clarity

Making decisions with a clear mind is crucial for good judgment. Substances that impair your thinking, even temporarily, can lead to choices you'll regret when sober.

Your reputation and relationships are too valuable to risk for temporary escapism.

**Daily Action:** Find healthy ways to unwind and socialize that don't rely on substances. Your future self will thank you.

## 📈 Maintain High Standards

Settling for ""good enough"" in important areas of your life often leads to long-term dissatisfaction. Whether it's relationships, career opportunities, or personal goals, having clear standards helps you make better choices.

This doesn't mean perfectionism—it means knowing what you value and refusing to compromise on things that truly matter to you.

**Daily Action:** Write down your non-negotiable standards in three key areas of your life. Use these as a filter for future decisions.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Build Your Chosen Family

The relationships you actively choose and nurture often become more significant than the family you were born into. This includes your partner, close friends, mentors, and potentially your own children.

Invest your energy in relationships with people who support your growth and share your values.

**Daily Action:** Schedule quality time with someone you consider part of your chosen family. Prioritize these relationships as much as you would any important business meeting.

## 🛡️ Develop Emotional Armor

Taking things personally is one of the fastest ways to create unnecessary stress and conflict. Most people's actions and words reflect their own internal state more than anything about you.

Developing this emotional detachment doesn't mean becoming cold—it means maintaining your peace regardless of others' behavior.

**Daily Action:** When someone's words or actions upset you, ask yourself: ""What might be happening in their world that has nothing to do with me?"" This simple reframe can save you hours of mental energy.

## The Real Work Begins Now 🚀

These insights are only valuable if you apply them consistently. Pick two or three that resonate most strongly with you and focus on implementing them over the next month.

Remember: small, consistent changes compound over time into dramatic transformations. You don't need to overhaul your entire life overnight. Just start making smarter choices, one decision at a time.

Your 40s and beyond can be your most productive, fulfilling, and prosperous years—but only if you're willing to challenge comfortable assumptions and take responsibility for creating the life you actually want.

The clock is ticking, but you still have time to make it count. ⏰

I’m looking for gift ideas for her, something that she will like. A bit about her- she’s in her early 40s, young at heart, very lively, outgoing, loves coffee and has the kind of bright smile that lights up a room. The challenge is, she’s already quite well-off and has everything branded you could think of (think Chanel bags, Gucci shoes, luxury perfumes), so I’m not sure what to get her. I don't want to get anything beauty related because I am sure she probably won't like it if it's not a luxury brand and I can't afford it.

I found she began exchanging messages with a married guy who took an ugly chair we wanted to get rid of for free. Over some weeks he started flirting with her saying she has pretty eyes, she looks like a famous actress etc. She manipulateed him into doing several chores for her, bringing in furniture and other items I didn't approve of - she has a hoarding problem and we have  discussed this endlessly.  He invited her to see him playing squash and to a gym and for coffee. There are several messages she deleted and so did he. Not once did she rebuke him. A decent married person would have blocked such a person immediately but she kept him on a leash. She recently agreed to meet him outside the house as we have multiple  relatives staying with us long term. That is the point I confronted her. She spoke of the matter very causally and tried to brush it off saying its not an affair and confessed she has multiple admirers that she extracts favours from. One of them is an 80 year old grandad ! 

We are from a highly conservative country,  living in another very very conservative country where any casual contact between married people of the opposite gender just does not happen (unless secretively /in an affair). She acts/claims to be religious and even more conservative than me. I guess no amount of religiousness can set one's moral compass straight.

She apologized in a message and says she doesn't know what she was thinking.
I am still in a stunned state but as far as I assess the matter there are some majorly  serious red flags here:

-Indecency
-Immorality
-Manipulativeness
-Materialism
-Secrecy 
-Betrayal of trust
-Emotional cheating ?


Somewhere in their is naivety and utter stupidity but its hard to imagine a person of such age can be so immature.

1n2l9rx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechTactics/comments/1n2l9rx/should_you_buy_the_best_business_laptop_lenovo/,Should You Buy the Best Business Laptop Lenovo V15 for Work Tasks,"The Lenovo V15 caught my attention as an all-purpose business laptop, especially with the promise of its Intel Celeron N5100 processor paired with a massive 32GB DDR4 RAM and 1TB SSD. I couldn’t resist trying it out for daily tasks—think emails, presentations, and some video editing sprinkled in. Finding out how it holds up to real-life use felt like the mission I needed to embark on.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Straight out of the box, I noticed the sleek matte black finish that gives the laptop an understated yet professional vibe. Weighing just 3.75 lbs, it’s light enough to carry around without it feeling like a burden. As someone constantly navigating between meetings and coffee shops, portability is non-negotiable, and this device ticks that box. The 15.6-inch FHD anti-glare display is a delight! Even in brightly lit environments, I didn’t have to struggle to see my spreadsheets. Though the bezels are just a tad chunky for my liking, it doesn’t diminish the practicality or visuals of the screen.  

**Performance**  
Loading apps and multitasking was surprisingly smooth. With the power of the Intel Celeron N5100, casual spaced-out usage like juggling browser tabs, streamed media, and Office Suite worked out like clockwork. The 32GB RAM is the unsung hero here. Unlike other laptops I’ve tested with only 8 or 16GB, this one didn’t buckle under the pressure of large data sheets or browser tabs open by the dozens. However, the processor isn’t built for high-powered gaming or rendering 4K videos. Would someone buying this laptop miss out? Probably not unless they’re looking to moonlight as a graphic designer.  

**Enhanced Connectivity**  
One of the biggest game changers for me was the Ethernet RJ-45 port. My Wi-Fi sometimes drops during virtual meetings, so the Ethernet connectivity saved the day more often than I expected. In addition, USB 3.2 ports were fast for file transfers when I hooked up an external drive, while HDMI functionality came in clutch for presentations on office projectors. The Bluetooth 5.1 and Wi-Fi 5 worked flawlessly, but a slight bonus upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 could’ve future-proofed the device.  

**Good Points**  
- Ample Storage: A 1TB SSD is more than enough space for all your professional documents, media, and beyond.  
- Longevity: The battery life lasted easily over 8 hours with mixed usage, though not quite near the claimed 11.5 hours.  
- Security: The camera privacy shutter is thoughtful, and the pre-installed Windows 11 Pro elevates security measures.  
- Port Selection: Ethernet, USB 2.0/3.2, HDMI, and mic/headphone jack ensure all bases are covered.

[Check Lenovo V15 price on Amazon.](https://metaversegenome.com/p/b0d8cz6jxz/)

**Audio and Webcam**  
A big shoutout to the 720p HD webcam with its privacy shutter! That shutter feels like peace of mind, especially during idle Zoom moments. Video clarity was decent—don’t expect a DSLR effect, though. On audio, the stereo speakers did their job okay for moderate use. Dolby Audio ensures you don't wince at the sound quality, but if you’re going to watch movies or stream music, headphones will take the experience up a notch.

**Negative Attributes**  
- **Durability Limits**: While sleek, the chassis felt like it might pick up scratches easily after a few months of use.  
- **Processor Ceiling**: For everyday workflows it’s perfect, but power users will feel a lack of punch in performance for demanding software.  
- **Display Sharpness in Detail**: Despite being a Full HD screen, some finer details during outdoor usage could use more brightness oomph.  

**Rival Brands**  
Comparing this machine with others like the ASUS VivoBook or Dell Inspiron series in similar price brackets gave me mixed feelings. The Lenovo V15 stands out because of the massive 32GB RAM (most rivals only offer 16GB max). Also, it edges out some competitors with the additional Ethernet port for die-hard wired users. However, something like the Dell Inspiron often feels like it has better-performing processors in similar builds. If you’re all about upgrading longevity, though, Lenovo’s robust RAM and SSD options win.  

**Value Assessment**  
Is it worth the cost? For students and small business users, the Lenovo V15 will feel incredibly thoughtful, giving utility minus all unnecessary extra whistles. As someone looking into day-to-day multitasking laptops, its storage and RAM make it worth betting on. Fancy rendering-work enthusiasts? Look elsewhere, perhaps at something boasting higher CPU boosts.

## When Wisdom Transcends Identity

Have you ever wondered what connects the greatest teachers throughout human history? It's not the labels we've attached to them or the institutions built in their names. It's something far more profound and universally accessible: their unwavering commitment to love as the fundamental force of human existence.

### 🌟 The Great Paradox of Historical Teachers

History presents us with a fascinating paradox. The most influential figures who shaped human consciousness weren't defined by the movements that later claimed them. They were simply individuals who understood something essential about the human experience – that love, compassion, and understanding form the bedrock of meaningful existence.

These remarkable people didn't see themselves as founders of exclusive clubs or rigid belief systems. They were perpetual students of life, constantly learning, growing, and sharing their insights with anyone willing to listen. Their approach was refreshingly simple: treat others with kindness, seek understanding over judgment, and recognize the inherent worth in every human being.

### 💡 The Student's Mindset in Daily Life

What can we learn from this approach? The concept of being an ""eternal student"" isn't just philosophical – it's intensely practical for modern living.

**In Your Personal Relationships** 💕
- Approach disagreements with curiosity rather than defensiveness
- Listen to understand, not to win arguments
- Recognize that every person you meet has something to teach you
- Practice forgiveness as a gift to yourself, not just others

**At Your Workplace** 🏢
- View challenges as learning opportunities rather than obstacles
- Collaborate instead of competing unnecessarily
- Share knowledge freely without expecting immediate returns
- Treat colleagues with respect regardless of hierarchy

**In Your Community** 🌍
- Volunteer your time for causes you care about
- Help neighbors without keeping score
- Support local businesses and community initiatives
- Practice tolerance for different perspectives and lifestyles

### 🎯 Practical Applications for Modern Living

The wisdom of history's greatest teachers translates into actionable principles for today's world:

**Daily Mindfulness Practices**
- Start each morning asking: ""How can I contribute positively today?""
- End each evening reflecting: ""What did I learn about myself and others?""
- Practice gratitude for three specific things daily
- Take time to really listen when others speak

**Building Stronger Connections**
- Make eye contact during conversations
- Remember and use people's names
- Ask genuine questions about others' experiences
- Offer help without being asked

**Creating Positive Change**
- Stand up for what's right, even when it's difficult
- Admit your mistakes and learn from them
- Encourage others to pursue their dreams
- Share resources and opportunities with those who need them

### 🚀 The Ripple Effect of Love-Centered Living

When you prioritize love and understanding in your daily interactions, something remarkable happens. Your approach becomes contagious. People around you start responding differently. Conversations become more meaningful. Conflicts resolve more easily. Trust builds naturally.

This isn't about being naive or avoiding difficult conversations. It's about approaching life's challenges with an open heart and a commitment to finding solutions that benefit everyone involved.

**At Home** 🏠
- Create a environment where family members feel safe to express themselves
- Celebrate each other's successes without comparison
- Support each other through difficulties without judgment
- Make time for meaningful conversations beyond daily logistics

**In Your Professional Life** 💼
- Mentor someone who could benefit from your experience
- Acknowledge others' contributions publicly
- Take responsibility for mistakes without blame-shifting
- Look for win-win solutions in negotiations

**In Society** 🤝
- Vote and participate in civic activities thoughtfully
- Treat service workers with respect and appreciation
- Practice patience in crowded places and traffic
- Consider the environmental impact of your choices

### 🌈 Breaking Down Artificial Barriers

One of the most powerful aspects of focusing on love as a guiding principle is how it naturally breaks down the artificial barriers that divide us. When you approach others with genuine care and interest, surface-level differences become far less important.

**Moving Beyond Categories**
- See people as individuals rather than representatives of groups
- Focus on shared human experiences rather than differences
- Ask questions to understand rather than to categorize
- Challenge your own assumptions regularly

**Building Bridges**
- Find common ground in conversations with people who think differently
- Share meals and experiences with diverse groups of people
- Learn about other cultures and perspectives with genuine curiosity
- Support businesses and organizations that promote inclusion

### 🛠️ Tools for Everyday Implementation

Here are specific techniques you can start using immediately:

**The 24-Hour Rule** ⏰
Before responding to frustrating situations, wait 24 hours when possible. This simple practice prevents reactive responses and allows for more thoughtful, loving reactions.

**The Three Questions Method** 🤔
Before speaking or acting in challenging situations, ask yourself:
1. Is it true?
2. Is it necessary?
3. Is it kind?

**The Daily Check-In** 📝
Spend five minutes each evening reviewing:
- One act of kindness you witnessed or performed
- One lesson you learned about yourself
- One way you could improve tomorrow

**The Gratitude Practice** 🙏
Each morning, identify three specific things you're grateful for. Make them different each day to expand your awareness of life's abundance.

### 🌱 Growing Your Capacity for Love

Love isn't a finite resource – the more you practice it, the more it grows. Like a muscle that strengthens with exercise, your ability to respond with love and understanding develops through consistent practice.

**Start Small**
- Smile genuinely at people you pass on the street
- Say ""thank you"" more often and mean it
- Hold doors open for others
- Let people merge in traffic without frustration

**Expand Gradually**
- Volunteer for causes that matter to you
- Mentor someone in your field of expertise
- Donate items you no longer need
- Write encouraging notes to people in your life

**Think Long-Term**
- Consider how your actions today affect future generations
- Invest in relationships rather than just transactions
- Support sustainable practices in your community
- Leave places better than you found them

### 💪 Overcoming Common Obstacles

Implementing a love-centered approach isn't always easy. Here's how to handle common challenges:

**When Others Don't Reciprocate**
Remember that your behavior is about your values, not others' responses. Continue acting with integrity regardless of how others behave.

**When You're Feeling Overwhelmed**
Start smaller. You don't need to save the world today. Focus on one kind act, one meaningful conversation, one moment of genuine presence.

**When You Make Mistakes**
Acknowledge them quickly, learn from them, and move forward. Perfection isn't the goal – growth is.

**When You Face Criticism**
Listen for any valid points while maintaining your commitment to treating others well. Not all criticism is accurate, but some of it might help you improve.

### 🎉 Celebrating Progress

Recognize and celebrate the positive changes you see in yourself and your relationships as you implement these practices. Keep a journal of positive interactions and their outcomes. Notice how differently people respond to you when you approach them with genuine care and interest.

### 🔮 A Timeless Approach for the Future

The principles of love, understanding, and continuous learning aren't bound by current technology, political systems, or cultural trends. They represent fundamental truths about human nature that remain relevant across generations and circumstances.

Whether humanity faces challenges we can't yet imagine or achieves breakthroughs beyond our current dreams, the basic need for connection, understanding, and mutual support will remain constant. By cultivating these qualities now, you're not only improving your immediate life but also contributing to a legacy of wisdom and compassion that will serve future generations.

### 🌍 Your Role in the Bigger Picture

Every interaction you have is an opportunity to contribute to the kind of world you want to live in. When you choose understanding over judgment, collaboration over competition, and love over fear, you're participating in humanity's oldest and most important tradition: the passing down of wisdom through example.

The greatest teachers throughout history weren't special because they were perfect – they were special because they understood that love is the most powerful force for positive change in human experience. They showed us that this power is available to everyone, not just a chosen few.

Your daily choices to listen more carefully, help more freely, judge less harshly, and love more openly are continuing their work in the world. You don't need a title, an institution, or recognition to make a meaningful difference. You just need to show up with an open heart and a willingness to learn.

The invitation is simple: become an eternal student of love, and watch how it transforms not only your life but the lives of everyone around you.

I’m looking to buy a new machine after not having one for a few years. I used to have a bambino, so I’m not super familiar with some of the higher end machines.

I only drink light roast coffees. I tend to do americanos or cappuccinos/ lattes. I live solo and usually make 2 cups a day. Having the capability to make multiple cups in a sitting would be nice for family/ friend visits, but is not something that I will need to consider for day to day use. 

I really like the aesthetics of E61 style machines, but my main priority is to make a smart purchase vs only for looks. The BDB seems like a great deal ($1600 in the US), but I’m a little hesitant to get another breville machine. I’ve also been eyeing some Lelits like the MaraX or Elizabeth.

I’m a big fan of all things geeky, nerdy, and other things that have their own niche. I don’t really know anyone who shares the same interests as I moved here from RI where the few friends I have are.

I’ve always wanted to assemble a group of likeminded people for get togethers, conversations over drinks or coffee (all topics welcome, but personally I’m into retro pop culture, 70s/80s nostalgia, also a cult movie enthusiast, love the standards, but not limited to, Star Wars, Alien, Return of the Living Dead, Rocky Horror, Jaws, Clockwork Orange, etc.) have game nights, road trips…

I’m also a huge toy collector, from vintage to modern adult collectibles. It would be great to have people to talk about the topic, share stories, maybe have swap meets, travel to local cons, comic shops, and collectibles shows, share news about the topic and just making overall mutual friends that get along on our (the geeks) level. Also hoping to build on the group with suggestions for the group, helping expand and widen the spectrum, creating a growing diverse group.

I was in a situationship with one of my closest friends but a month ago she said shes not ready for a relationship. It hurt but I respected her decision. I thought it was my breakthrough, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.

Now though, I'm really struggling. I talked to her and hung out with hee pretty much all the time, she was my closest friend and I would always hang out with her friends as well for coffee/lunch during the week when we were all at work. Now I'm completely lonely and feel a bit abandoned cause I don't have my own solid friend group here or someone I can trust in anymore, I have friends in other places around the world but they are in different time zones and its hard for me to lean on them when I need because of that.

Work has been very stressful lately too (we all worked at different places but would have lunch meet ups during the week). I'm just drowning in everything right now, I've even noticed more white hairs appearing in my beard cause of the stress and grief of everything. And now I'm stressing over that, and everything is just compounding. I've been fine listening to music in my room then I just start crying out of nowhere. I'm renting in an apartment and have found out so hard to have the courage to get out of bed on some days.

I really could use some words of encouragement and support, it's just so hard for me, everything is so difficult right now.

I have no idea how to cope with this at all 😞",2,1756408078.0,DadForAMinute,0,1.0,False

  Arms filled with groceries, CC struggled to pull her key from the lock and push the door shut behind her with her foot. Automatically, she glanced up at the clock in the foyer of her spacious apartment. Seven-thirty already. It had taken her an eternity to finish things up at the Communication Center and then stop by the package store and the commissary. After that, fighting the traffic from Tinker Air Force Base had been like driving through axle-deep mud. To add to her frustration, she had tried to take a shortcut home and had ended up taking a wrong turn. Soon she was hopelessly lost. A kind soul at a Quick Trip had given her directions, and she had felt compelled to explain to him that she was lost only because she had been stationed at Tinker for just three months, and she hadn't had time to learn her way around yet.  
  
  The man had patted her shoulder like a she was a puppy and asked, ""What is a young little thing like you doing in the air force?"" CC had treated the question rhetorically, thanked him and driven away, face hot with embarrassment.  
  
  Understandably, her already harried nerves jumped at the insistent sound of her ringing phone.  
  
  ""Hang on! I'm coming!"" she yelled and rushed into the kitchen, plopping the bags unceremoniously onto the spotless counter and lunging for the phone.  
  
  ""Hello,"" she panted into the dead sound of a dial tone that was broken only by the rhythmic bleat of her answering machine. ""Well, at least they left a message. "" CC sighed and carried the phone with her back to the kitchen, punching in her message retrieval code. With one hand she held the phone to her ear, and with the other, she extracted twin bottles of champagne from one of the bags.  
  
  ""You have two new messages,"" the mechanical voice proclaimed. ""First new message, sent at five-thirty p. m. ""  
  
  CC listened attentively as she picked at the metallic casing that covered the wire-imprisoned champagne cork.  
  
  ""Hello, Christine, it's your parents!"" Her mom's recorded voice, sounding a little unnatural and tinny, chirped through the phone.  
  
  ""Hi there, Christine!"" More distant, but similarly cheerful, Dad's voice echoed from an extension.  
  
  CC smiled indulgently. Of course it was her parents—they were the only two people on this earth who still insisted on calling her by her given name.  
  
  ""Just wanted to say we didn't actually forget your big day. ""  
  
  Here her mom paused, and she could hear her dad chuckling in the background. Forget her birthday? She hadn't thought they had—until then.  
  
  Her mom's breathy voice continued. ""We've just been running ourselves ragged getting ready for our next cruise! You know how long it takes your father to pack. "" This said in a conspiratorial whisper. ""But don't worry, honey, even though we didn't get your box off, we did manage to fix up a little surprise for our favorite twenty-five year old. ""  
  
  ""Twenty-five?"" Her dad sounded honestly surprised. ""Well, good Lord. I thought she was only twenty-two. ""  
  
  ""Time sure flies, dear, "" Mom said sagely.  
  
  ""Damn straight, honey,"" Dad agreed. ""That's one reason I told you we should spend more time traveling—but only one reason. "" Dad chuckled suggestively.  
  
  ""You certainly were right about that reason, dear. "" Mom kidded back breathlessly, suddenly sounding decades younger.  
  
  ""They're flirting with each other on my message,"" CC sputtered. ""And they really did forget my birthday!""  
  
  ""Anyway, we're getting ready to leave for the airport—""  
  
  Dad's voice, even more distant, broke in. ""Elinor! Say good-bye, the airport limo is here. ""  
  
  ""Well, have to go, Birthday Girl! Oh, and you have a nice time on your little air force trip. Aren't you leaving in a couple of days?""  
  
  Her little air force trip?! CC rolled her eyes. Her ninety-day deployment as noncommissioned officer in charge of Quality Control at the Communications Center at Riyadh Air Base in Saudi Arabia to support the war on terrorism was just a ""little air force trip?""  
  
  ""And, honey, don't you worry about flying wherever it is you're going. You're old enough to be over that silly fear by now. And, my goodness, you did join the air force!""  
  
  CC shuddered, wishing her mother hadn't mentioned her phobia—airplanes—since she would soon be flying halfway around the world over oceans of water. It was the only part of the air force she didn't like.  
  
  ""We love you! Bye now. ""  
  
  The message ended and CC, still shaking her head, hit the Off button and put the phone on the counter.  
  
  ""I can't believe you guys forgot my birthday! You've always said that it's impossible to forget my birthday because I was born right before midnight on Halloween. "" She berated the phone while she reached into a cabinet for a champagne flute. ""You didn't even remember my box. "" She continued to glare at the phone as she wrestled with the champagne cork.  
  
  For the seven years CC had been on active duty service in the United States Air Force, her parents had never forgotten her birthday box. Until now. Her twenty-fifth birthday—she had lived one-fourth a century. It really was a landmark year, and she was going to celebrate it with no birthday box from home.  
  
  ""It's a family tradition!"" she sputtered, popping the cork and holding the foaming bottle over the sink.  
  
  CC sighed and felt an unexpected twinge of homesickness.  
  
  No, she reminded herself sternly, she liked her life in the air force and had never been sorry for her impetuous decision to join the service right out of high school. After all, it had certainly gotten her away from her nice, ordinary, quiet, small town life. No, she hadn't exactly ""seen the world,"" as the ads had promised. But she had lived in Texas, Mississippi, Nebraska, Colorado and now Oklahoma, which were five states more than the majority of the complacent people in her hometown of Homer, Illinois, would ever live in, or even visit.  
  
  ""Apparently that doesn't include my parents!"" CC poured the glass of champagne, sipped it and tapped her foot—still glaring at the phone. It seemed that during the past year her parents had gone on more Silver Adventure Tours than was humanly possible. ""They must be trying to set some sort of record. "" CC remembered the flirty banter in their voices and closed her eyes quickly at that particular visual image.  
  
  Her eyes snapped back open, and her gaze fastened again on the phone.  
  
  ""But Mom, none of your homemade chocolate chip cookies?"" She sipped the champagne and discovered she needed a refill. ""How am I supposed to cover all the food groups without my birthday box?"" She reached into the other bag and pulled out the bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken, original recipe, of course. Pointing from the chicken to the champagne, she continued her one-sided discourse. ""I have the meat group—KFC—mixed with the all important grease group for proper digestion. Then I have the fruit group, champagne, my personal favorite. How am I supposed to complete the culinary birthday ensemble without the dairy/chocolate/sugar group?"" She gestured in disgust at the phone.  
  
  Lifting the lid off the KFC, she snagged a drumstick and bit into it. Then, using it to punctuate her hand gestures, she continued.  
  
  ""You know that you guys always send something totally useless that makes me laugh and remember home. No mat-ter where I am. Like the year before last when you sent me the frog rain gauge. And I don't have a yard! And how about the God Bless this House stepping stone, which I have to hang on the wall of my apartment, because I have no house!"" CC's disgruntled look was broken by a smile as she recounted her parents' silly gifts.  
  
  ""I suppose you're trying to tell me to get married, or at the very least, to become a homeowner. ""  
  
  She chewed thoughtfully and sighed again, a little annoyed to realize that she probably sounded fifteen instead of twenty-five. Then she brightened.  
  
  ""Hey! I forgot about my other message,"" she told the phone as she scooped it back up, dialed her messages, and skipped  
past her parents' voices.  
  
  ""Next new message. Sent at 6:32 p. m. ""  
  
  CC grinned around a mouth full of chicken. It was probably Sandy, her oldest friend—actually she was the only high school friend CC still kept in touch with. Sandy had known her since first grade, and she rarely forgot anything, let alone a birthday. The two of them loved to laugh long distance about how they had managed to ""escape"" small town Homer. Sandy had landed an excellent job working for a large hospital in the fun and fabulous city of Chicago. Her official title was Physician Affairs Liaison, which actually meant she was in charge of recruiting new doctors for the hospital, but she and Sandy loved the totally unrealistic, risque-sounding title. It was especially amusing because Sandy had been happily and faithfully married for three years.  
  
  ""Hi there, CC. Long time no call, girl!""  
  
  Instead of Sandy's familiar midwestern accent, the voice had a long, fluid Southern drawl. ""It's me, Halley. Your favorite Georgia peach! Oh, my—I had such a hard time getting your new phone number. Naughty you forgot to give it to me when you shipped out. ""  
  
  CC's grin slipped off her face like wax from a candle. Halley was one of the few things she hadn't missed about her last duty station.  
  
  ""Just have a quick second to talk. I'm calling to remind you that my thirtieth birthday is just a month and a half  
  
  away—December fifteenth, to be exact—and I want you to mark your little ol' calendar. ""  
  
  CC listened with disbelief. ""This is like a train wreck. It just keeps getting worse and worse. ""  
  
  ""I'm having the Party to End All Parties, and I expect your attendance. So put in for leave ASAP. I'll send the formal invite in a week or so. And, yes, presents are acceptable. "" Halley giggled like a Southern Barbie doll. ""See y 'all soon. Bye-bye for now!""  
  
  ""I don't believe it. "" CC punched the Off button with decidedly more force than was strictly necessary. ""First my parents forget my birthday. Then not only does it look like my oldest friend has forgotten it too, but I get a call from an annoying non-friend inviting me to her party!"" She dropped the phone back on the counter. ""A month and a half in advance!""  
  
  CC shoved the unopened bottle of champagne into the fridge.  
  
  ""Consider yourself on-deck,"" she told it grimly. Then she grabbed the open bottle of champagne, her half-empty glass, the bucket of KFC and marched purposefully to the living room where she spread out her feast on the coffee table before returning to the kitchen for a handful of napkins. Passing the deceptively silent phone she halted and spun around.  
  
  ""Oh, no. I'm not done with you; you're coming with me. "" She tossed the phone next to her on the couch. ""Just sit there. I'm keeping an eye on you. ""  
  
  CC picked out another piece of delightfully greasy chicken and clicked on the TV—and groaned. The screen was nothing but static.  
  
  ""Oh, no! The cable!"" Because she would be out of the country for three months, she had decided to have the cable temporarily disconnected and had been proud of herself for being so money conscious. ""Not tonight! I told them effective the first of November, not the thirty-first of October. "" She glanced at the silent phone. ""You probably had something to do with this. ""  
  
  And she started to laugh, semihysterically.  
  
  ""I'm talking to the telephone. "" She poured herself an-other glass of champagne, noting the bottle was now half empty. Sipping the bubbly liquid thoughtfully, CC spoke aloud, pointedly ignoring the phone. ""This obviously calls for emergency measures. Time to break out the Favorite Girl Movies. ""  
  
  Clutching the chicken thigh between her teeth, she wiped her hands on the paper towel before opening the video cabinet that stood next to her television set. Through a full mouth she mumbled the titles as she scanned her stash.  
  
  ""Dirty Dancing, Shadowlands, West Side Story, Gone With the Wind. "" She paused and chewed, considering. ""Nope, too long—and it's really not birthday material. Humm…"" She kept reading. ""Superman, Pride and Prejudice, Last of the Mohicans, The Accidental Tourist, The Color Purple, The Witches of Eastwick. "" She stopped.  
  
  ""This is exactly what I need. Some Girl Power. "" She plunked the video in the VCR. ""No,"" she corrected herself. ""This is better than Girl Power—it's Women Power!"" CC raised her glass to the screen, toasting each of the vibrant movie goddess as they appeared. They were unique and fabulous.  
  
  Cher was mysterious and exotic, with a full, perfect mouth and a wealth of seductive ringlets that framed her face like the mane of a wild, dark lioness.  
  
  CC sighed. She couldn't really do anything about her own little lips—if she did, they would look like some kind of science experiment. Everything else about her was so small. But maybe it was time to rethink her short, boyish haircut.  
  
  Michelle Pfeiffer—now there was a gorgeous woman. Even playing the role of Ms. Fertile Mom, she was still undeniably ethereal in her blond beauty.  
  
  No one would ever call her cute.  
  
  And Susan Sarandon. She couldn't look frumpy even when she was dressed like an old schoolmarm music teacher. She oozed sexuality.  
  
  No guy would ever think of her as just a friend. At least no heterosexual guy.  
  
  ""To three amazing women who are everything I wish I  
  
  could be!"" She couldn't believe her glass was empty—and the bottle, too.  
  
  ""It's a darn good thing we have another. "" She patted the phone affectionately before rescuing the other champagne bottle from a life of loneliness in the fridge.  
  
  Ignoring the fact that her steps seemed a little unsteady, she settled back, grabbed a fourth piece of chicken and slanted a glance at the ever-silent phone. ""Bet it shocks you that someone who's so little can eat so much. ""  
  
  It answered with a shrill ring.  
  
  CC jumped, almost choking on the half-chewed piece of chicken. ""Good Lord, you scared the bejeezes out of me!""  
  
  The phone bleated again.  
  
  ""CC, it's a phone. Get it together, Sarg. "" She shook her head at her own foolishness.  
  
  The thing rang again before she had her hands wiped and her nerves settled enough to answer it.  
  
  ""H-hello?"" she said tentatively.  
  
  ""May I speak with Christine Canady, please?"" The woman's voice was unfamiliar, but pleasant sounding.  
  
  ""This is she. "" CC clicked the remote and paused The Witches of Eastwick.  
  
  ""Miss Canady, this is Jess Brown from Woodland Hills Resort in Branson, Missouri. I'm calling to tell you that your parents, Elinor and Herb, have given you a weekend in Branson at our beautiful resort for your twenty-second birthday! Happy Birthday, Miss Canady!"" CC could almost see Jess Brown beaming in delight all the way from Branson. Wherever that was.  
  
  ""Twenty-fifth,"" was all she could make her mouth say.  
  
  ""Pardon?""  
  
  ""It's my twenty-fifth birthday, not my twenty-second. ""  
  
  ""No. "" Through the phone came the sound of papers being frantically rustled. ""No, it says right here—Christine Canady, twenty-second birthday. ""  
  
  ""But I'm not. ""  
  
  ""Not Christine Canady?"" Jess sounded worried.  
  
  ""Not twenty-two!"" CC eyed the newly opened second bottle of champagne. Maybe she was drunk and hallucinating.  
  
  II  
  
  ""But you are Christine Canady?""  
  
  ""Yes. ""  
  
  ""And your parents are Elinor and Herb Canady?""  
  
  ""Yes. ""  
  
  ""Well, as long as you're really you, I suppose the rest doesn't matter. "" Jess was obviously relieved.  
  
  ""I guess not. "" CC shrugged helplessly. She decided she might as well join the madness.  
  
  ""Good!"" Jess's perkiness was back in place. ""Now, just a few little details you should know. You can plan your weekend anytime in the next year, but you will need to call to reserve your cabin…""  
  
  Cabin? CC's mind whirred. What had they done?  
  
  ""… at least one month ahead of time or we cannot guarantee availability. And, of course, this gift is just for your personal use, but if you would like to bring a friend, the resort would be willing to allow him or he  
r to join you for a nominal fee—or for totally free if he or she would be willing to attend a short informational meeting about our time share facility. ""  
  
  CC closed her eyes and rubbed her right temple where the echo of a headache was just beginning.  
  
  ""And along with your wonderful Woodland weekend,"" Jess Brown alliterated, ""your parents have generously reserved a ticket for you to the Andy Williams Moon River Theater, one of the most popular and long-running shows in Branson!""  
  
  CC couldn't stop the bleak groan that escaped her lips.  
  
  ""Oh, I can well understand your excitement!"" Jess gushed. ""We'll be sending you the official information packet in the mail. Just let me double-check your address…""  
  
  CC heard herself woodenly confirming her address.  
  
  ""Okay! I think that's all the information we need. You have a lovely evening, Miss Canady, and a very happy twenty-second birthday!"" Jess Brown cheerfully clicked off the line.  
  
  ""But where is Branson?"" CC asked the dial tone.

Chapter Two  
  
  ""That's right!"" CC scouted at the TV, sloshing champagne onto the carpet as she raised her glass dramatically. ""Click him off, girlfriends! Jack Nicholson wasn't cute, anyway—it was the three of you who really had the magic the whole time. ""  
  
  CC hardly noticed her unsteadiness as she got to her feet to dance the Woman's Magic Victory Dance while the movie credits rolled.  
  
  ""Mr. Phone. "" She took a break from her Victory Dance to catch her breath. Fleetingly, she wondered just who had eaten all that KFC.  
  
  Mr. Phone seemed to be smiling at her from his place on the couch.  
  
  ""Do you know that women have all the magic?""  
  
  He didn't answer.  
  
  ""Of course you don't—you're a phone!"" CC giggled. ""You didn't even know I was twenty-five instead of twenty-two. "" She laughed until she snorted. ""But you do now. And after watching that most excellent movie, you should know that women have magic, too. ""  
  
  Mr. Phone seemed skeptical.  
  
  ""It's true! Didn't Cher and Michelle and Susan just prove it?"" CC wobbled, but only a little. ""Oh, I see what you mean. You think they have magic, but you don't really believe that an ordinary woman, like me, could have magic. ""  
  
  CC couldn't be entirely sure, but he appeared to be willing to listen.  
  
  ""Okay. You may be right, but what if you're not? What if women really do have something within them, and we just have to find it? Like they did. "" CC felt the spark of an idea, and her brow wrinkled in an attempt at concentration. ""They didn't believe it at first, either, but that didn't stop it from working. Maybe it doesn't matter if you're ordinary-looking, or if you're new somewhere and you don't have any friends yet. "" Or, CC's mind added, if your birthday has been forgotten. ""Maybe all it takes is a leap of faith. ""  
  
  And a milky light flashed in the corner of her left eye, breaking her concentration.  
  
  What the…? A little shiver of trepidation fingered its way down the nape of her neck.  
  
  The light was coming from behind the closed drapes that shrouded the patio doors leading to her balcony.  
  
  CC checked the VCR clock. The digital numbers read 10:05 p. m.  
  
  ""Must be the streetlights,"" she told Mr. Phone, but her eyes remained riveted on the captivating glimpse of brightness. The sliver of light she could see had an odd quality, totally unlike the sterile brightness of streetlights.  
  
  ""Could be headlights from a parked car. "" But as she said it she knew it couldn't be true. Not in her top floor apartment. Car headlights didn't shine up. They also didn't have a quality of warmth that made her want to bathe herself in them.  
  
  CC's feet took her to the drapes before she consciously told them to move.  
  
  ""You asked for some magic,"" she whispered. Slowly, like she was moving through the sweet twilight between awake and asleep, she reached up and parted the curtains.  
  
  ""Oh…"" The word came out on a breath. ""It is magic. ""  
  
  The full moon hung perfect and luminous above her as if the goddess Diana herself had placed it there as a birthday offering. It bathed the riot of potted plants that crowded the balcony in a warm, opal-like glow. She quickly unlatched the glass doors and stepped out into the gentle warmth of a late October night.  
  
  CC's balcony was large, and it looked out on a greenbelt that divided the apartment complex and an upscale neighborhood. The amazing balcony was the reason she had decided to stretch her budget and afford the rent for the pricey apartment. She loved to sit there and let the comforting sounds of the greenery melt away the tension that too often clung to her from work and could even stubbornly stay with her through her kick-boxing class and the warm bubble bath soak she so often took after class. She had spent many evenings there, as was evident by the comfortable wicker rocking chair and the matching whatnot table that was just the right size to hold a book and a glass of something cold. Nestled in the middle of the lush plants was her favorite piece of balcony furniture, a mini version of a chimenea.  
  
  Tonight the creamy color of the chimenea caught the moon's caress and reflected its light like moonlight off the sands of an exotic beach.  
  
  Suddenly, she tilted her head back and spread her arms, as if she could embrace the night. The full moon filled her vision and she felt her body flush, like she was being saturated in the light of another world.  
  
  And her head snapped up.  
  
  ""It is true,"" she said to the listening night. ""It must be true. ""  
  
  And an idea was born, conceived of champagne and moonlight. CC grinned and whirled back through the open glass doors. Practically skipping, she rushed to her bedroom, already unbuttoning her air force uniform. The dark blue skirt and light blue blouse pooled with her pantyhose and bra.  
  
  ""Step one. ""  
  
  Naked, CC pulled open her pajama drawer and pawed through it until she found the long, silk nightgown that lay at the bottom, ignored for her more practical cotton nightshirts. A uniform is good for work, but not for magic, she told herself and pulled the pale gown over her head, loving the erotic feel of it as it slid down her naked body.  
  
  ""I will wear this more often,"" she promised aloud.  
  
  ""Step two. "" She moved resolutely to her spare room, which she had recently begun to set up as an office. So far she had only had the time and money to buy a computer desk and chair for her five-year-old computer. Her books were stacked neatly on the floor, waiting for the bookshelves that she had promised them. She flicked on the overhead light and started searching through the piles of old textbooks, accumulated over the past seven years while she haphazardly took college classes, never sure which field she wanted to major in. CC combed through texts that ranged from Anatomy and Physiology lab guides to Basic Business Accounting 101.  
  
  ""Here you are!"" She pulled out the medium-sized text that had been hidden under an enormous Humanities tome. It was entitled, The Matriarchal Era—Myth and Legend. CC fondly remembered her semester of Women's Studies and the witty Professor Teresa Miller who had made that class one of her all-time favorites. She could still hear Ms. Miller's expressive voice reading aloud words that had been authored in an ancient time when women had been revered and even worshipped.  
  
  ""Where is it?"" she mumbled to herself as she scanned the index, her finger lightly going down each row of names, finally stopping near the beginning of the G's.  
  
  ""Gaea!""  
  
  She sat back on her heels, turned to page eighty-six, and read aloud: ""Gaea, or Gaia, was an Earth goddess, the Great Mother, known as the oldest of the divinities. She ruled magic, prophecy and motherhood. Although Zeus and other male gods took over her shrines during the emergence of the patriarchal insurgence, the gods swore all their oaths in her name, thus ultimately remaining subjected to her law. ""  
  
  CC nodded her head. This was exactly what she had been looking for. Gaea was the Mother of Magic. Flipping back to the index she turned pages till she found the R's.  
  
  ""Rituals! Earth Ritual page one-fifty-two. "" She shuffled through the slick, white pages and made a victorious exclamation when she found it. ""Ha! I knew it!"" Silently she read the ancient invocation, tugging on her bottom lip in concentration. When she had finished reading, she took the book to her desk and sat quietly for a moment, then with a satisfied smile she wrote a single sentence in blue ink on a piece of plain white Xerox paper and folded it once. Bending the page to mark her place in the text, she headed back to the living room, book and paper in hand.  
  
  This time when she stepped onto the balcony she brought with her the book, the piece of paper, a clean champagne flute filled with cold water, a box of long-handled matches and a determination that showed clearly in the square set of her shoulders.  
  
  The chimenea was just big enough to hold one block of fragrant pinyon wood. Deftly, she fed its small mouth and lit the dry pinyon. Then she moved to a long, thin planter that was hooked to the wrought iron balcony railing. She caressed the velvety leaves and bent to inhale the tangy fragrance of mint.  
  
  ""It's a lucky thing that I have such a green thumb. ""  
She smiled.  
  
  Choosing carefully, she snapped off the tops of several of the larger plants.  
  
  The spicy scent of burning pinyon rose from the chimenea like mist. The smoke hovered around the balcony. Clearly visible in the moonlight, it twisted and lifted in the warm breeze like ocean waves. CC's breath caught in excitement as she hurried to position herself in front of the chimenea. She placed the cut mint on the little table next to the glass of water and the piece of paper, then she opened the book to the turned-down page. With a growing sense of excitement she cleared her throat and began to read.  
  
  ""Great Mother, Gaea, ripe creatress of all that exists, I call upon you to be here with me now. ""  
  
  As she fell into the rhythm of the ancient ritual, the tentative quality left her voice and she felt an unexpected rush of feeling pass over the hair on her bare arms, almost like a spark of static electricity.  
  
  ""I need your guidance as I strive for spiritual knowledge and growth. Help me also with…"" CC paused. Here in the text there were the parenthesized words priestess states her purpose. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes, concentrating with all of her heart and soul, then she repeated, ""Help me also with creating magic in my life. ""  
  
  Reopening her eyes, she continued to read. ""I wish with all my heart to accomplish my desires in a positive way. Reveal to me the direction to take. I await your guidance and aid. ""  
  
  A breath of air touched the pages of the open book and for a moment it quivered and felt alive in her hands.  
  
  CC shivered in response. The night was hushed, like a lover waiting for her beloved's next words.  
  
  ""I give my desires and dreams into your keeping. ""  
  
  With one hand she held open the book. She used her other hand to fan her fingers slowly through the drifting pinyon smoke.  
  
  ""By air, I create the seed. "" The smoke swirled in lazy, dancing circles.  
  
  With the same hand she reached for the piece of folded paper, on which was written a single sentence in CC's compact cursive hand, ""I want magic in my life. "" The wish filled her mind… Oh, please, she prayed.  
  
  ""By fire, I warm it. ""  
  
  The paper went into the fire and caught instantly ablaze with a fierce, green flame.  
  
  Through her mind brushed the thought that it shouldn't have done that—it was just a simple piece of copy paper. Nothing about it could have made a wild, green flame. CC's heartbeat increased erratically, but she forced her hand to be steady as she took the crystal glass filled with cold, clear water and with delicate flicks of her fingers she scattered it in a small circle around the chimenea.  
  
  ""By water, I nourish it. ""  
  
  CC stepped within the newly made circle. It glistened in the moonlight like lacework made of mercury. She bent back to the table and gathered the sprigs of mint in her hand.  
  
  ""By Earth, I cause it to grow. ""  
  
  She tossed the delicate plants into the fire where they sizzled and glowed. She watched as they began to dissolve. For an instant CC thought they looked like some kind of exotic seaweed, and she could actually smell the salty tang of the ocean.  
  
  ""From spirit, I draw the power to make all things possible as I join in the power of the goddess. "" With a burst of emotion CC dropped the text to the table and completed the words of the ritual as if they were written upon her heart. ""Thank you, Gaea, Great Mother Goddess!""  
  
  As if in response to her invocation, the breeze shifted and cooled. The pinyon smoke spiraled up, diaphanous and glowing with the light of aquamarines. Transfixed, CC watched it disappear into the moon-drenched sky.  
  
  The breeze continued to increase, and CC impulsively raised her hands over her head, fingers outstretched as if she could capture the moon within them. Slowly she began to sway, letting the wind move her in time to the symphony of the night. Her bare feet found their own dance as they followed the circumference of the damp circle. The wind licked her body, drawing the silk of her nightgown against the warmth of her skin.  
  
  CC looked down at her body, and felt her eyes widen in surprise. Usually she thought of herself as too petite to be considered sexy, but tonight the moonlight mingled with silk, casting a spell on her body. Through the thin fabric her breasts were clearly visible and her small, perfect nipples felt sensitive and tight as they puckered against its softness. She swung her leg forward in a graceful dance step that had lain dormant within her since grade-school ballet lessons. The nightgown molded itself to her thighs, making her feel like she had just stepped from the canvas of a voluptuous Maxfield Parrish painting. The moonlight caught the ripples and folds of silk, giving life to the pale color and turning it into frothing sea foam. She laughed aloud at her unexpected beauty and twirled on feet that had wings.  
  
  ""I have magic!"" she proclaimed to the night.  
  
  Shadows flitted across the balcony, and she looked up to see wisps of clouds, like half-formed thoughts, beginning to obscure the face of the attendant moon. The wind increased,  
  
  GODDESS OF THE SEA  
  
  and CC's dance kept time with it, mirroring the tempo of the swaying trees.  
  
  The deafening crack of thunder should have frightened her, but instead CC felt like the coming storm had originated within her body. When the blue-white shard of lightning pierced the sky, it only fueled her appetite for the night, and she whooped, adding her own voice to the tempest.  
  
  Like a ripened fruit the sky burst apart, sending a rush of whimsical rain to join in her celebration. CC spun and twirled and laughed aloud. She reveled in every instant. She noticed how her plants seemed to move their leaves with her, and how the falling rain glistened amidst them like faceted jewels. Her eyes were drawn to the mundane stretch of blacktop parking lot below her, and she was amazed at how the rain had transformed it into the glasslike surface of a mysterious, shadow-covered ocean.  
  
  CC lifted her arms and pirouetted as the rain swathed her in damp majesty. She laughed aloud and believed she clearly heard the sound of another woman's musical laughter—and for a magically suspended moment their voices merged, filling the balcony with joy and love.  
  
  Then the sky exploded with another flash of light, and the rain roped down in a torrent. CC realized that her drapes were billowing wildly within her apartment and rain was drenching her living room carpet. Still laughing, she scrambled wetly through the open patio doors and pulled them securely closed behind her.  
  
  Shivering a little in a puddle of sopped carpet she should have felt melted; instead she felt invigorated. CC held her arms away from her body and watched as drops of water, sparkling like diamonds, slid down the soaked cloth of her nightgown.  
  
  ""I have never been this alive. "" She was compelled to speak the words aloud. She shook her head, letting the water float around her, and ran her fingers through her short curls.  
  
  ""I will let it grow,"" she promised.  
  
  And she realized her hair wasn't all she was ready to change. She was going to break her own mold.  
  
  Walking lightly, she made her way back to her bathroom and pulled a thick towel from the linen shelf. On the short dresser next to her bed she lit a candle that she had bought from a quaint little boutique aptly named the Secret Garden. She breathed deeply, filling herself with the candle's delicious vanilla-rum fragrance. The sweet scent drifted around her as she flicked the thin, damp straps of the gown from her shoulders and let the fabric slither from her body. Standing in the candlelit room she began to towel-dry, rubbing her already sensitized skin with light, circular strokes. Her hair was almost dry when she slid naked between the coolness of the clean sheets. With fingertips that were on fire, she caressed herself. Closing her eyes she moaned and arched into her hand, delighted and surprised by the exquisitely electric sensations that cascaded through her body.  
  
  As velvet sleep swept her away, CC was sure she heard a woman's laughter, the same magical laughter she had heard while she danced in the rain on her balcony. CC's lips curved into a smile, and she slept.  
  
  And while she slept, CC dreamed that a man's  
voice called to her in deep, seductive tones. Her dreaming body responded to that call and strained forward, but she felt unusually sluggish. In her dream she opened her eyes. She was surrounded by a veil of liquid blue. I'm underwater, her sleeping mind acknowledged.  
  
  Come to me, my love.  
  
  The rich voice sounded within her mind, and CC's pulse jumped.  
  
  Yes! She tried to yell her answer, but in her dream she was mute.  
  
  A light shimmered over her head and she peered up, squinting into the brightness. Just above the surface of the water a shape appeared. CC floated up, and the shape took on form and became a man. He was dark and exotic. His hair fell around his wide, bronzed shoulders in a black wave and his eyes laughed down at her. Through the ripples of the crystal waves she could see his easy smile as his outstretched hand beckoned to her.  
  
  She tried to reach up and take his hand, but her arm felt leaden. It would not obey her desire to respond.  
  
  The man's handsome face saddened. He looked lost and the voice inside her head was filled with longing.

1n2l1zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1n2l1zq/finally_landed_something_after_10_months_my/,Finally landed something after 10 months - my journey & what worked for me,"Not working for almost a year led me to some of the lowest lows I've ever experienced. Some days I felt completely worthless and like my life was leading nowhere. Luckily I was in therapy, otherwise I might have had to check myself in. 

I applied to hundreds of jobs on Linkedin & Indeed, most of which I was 100% qualified for. I talked to about 18 of those companies and was a finalist 4 times. One place dragged me through 7 interviews only to cancel the position. I’m hitting my mid-30s, which feels like career limbo, and I am tired. I was told I was overqualified for certain roles, and for others, not qualified for the specific industry. 

Finally, after another rejection following an on-site final round, I hit a breaking point. I decided to try a different tactic: posting a desperate instagram story explaining how bad my mental health has gotten and practically begging someone, anyone, for a job lead. I said I would scrub toilets, bag groceries, whatever, it didn’t matter because I even got ghosted from coffee shops. 

Plenty of people responded saying they were sorry about my predicament, they would ask around etc., and then ONE actual lead from an old college friend. She said that her former boss was hiring, put me in touch that day, and I had a call with him the next day. We hit it off, it was super casual, and he clocked I would be a better fit for a higher level position than the one I was interviewing for. I had one more interview with the person who would be training me, and that was it. IT ONLY TOOK 2 INTERVIEWS and I finally got an offer. It was the easiest interview process by far, and it's nowhere near entry level. That’s how impactful a referral can be. All because of a desperate instagram post. I wish I had done this much sooner. 

Interestingly, after countless rejections from job postings that might as well have been copy & pasted from my last job, I only have about 50% of the experience for the position I was offered.  Is it the absolute best dream job ever? No, it’s a start-up, it’s hectic, and the future of the business is uncertain. They were clear about this from the beginning. But, I’m relieved to have income again, and experience-wise, this job would be a good career booster if things worked out long term. I am very happy to be done filling out forms and answering the SAME questions over and over in interviews. At least for now.

So at the end of the day, what I learned is….it's about who you know. Which I know isn’t a shocker…

I don’t think people understand how shitty this process is until they experience it themselves. The job market is absolute trash, the amount of interviews companies drag you through feels exploitative & unnecessary, it’s all so demoralizing, exhausting, and a huge waste of time.

Best of luck everyone and hang in there.

1n2kzi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1n2kzi1/burn_novel_by_morgan_rice_free_read_online/,Burn Novel by Morgan Rice Free Read online," Chapter one  
  
  Ash McIntyre stood on the concrete walkway of Bryant Park, hands stuffed into his slacks pockets as he breathed in the spring air. There was still a nip in the wind, carrying with it hints of winter fading to spring. Around him, people sat on benches and in chairs at the small tables where they drank coffee, worked on laptops or were listening to iPods.  
  
  It was an absolutely gorgeous day, not that he usually indulged in things like a walk in the park or even being in a park, especially during business hours when he was usually entrenched in his office, on the phone or typing emails or making plans to travel. He wasn’t a “stop and smell the roses” kind of guy. But today he was restless and cagey, he had a lot on his mind, and he’d found himself here without really realizing that he’d planned to end up in the park.  
  
  Mia and Gabe’s wedding was a few short days away, and his business partner was up to his eyeballs in wedding preparations as he sought to ensure Mia had the wedding of her dreams. And Jace? His other best friend and business partner was in a very permanent relationship with his fiancée, Bethany, which meant that his two friends were otherwise occupied.  
  
  When they weren’t working, they were with their women, and it meant that Ash didn’t see them except at the office and on the occasions they all got together outside of work. They were still close, and Gabe and Jace ensured they’d stayed solid, including him in their changing lives. But it wasn’t the same. And while it was good for his friends, Ash still hadn’t quite come to terms with how rapidly all their lives had altered over the last eight months.  
  
  It was weird and life-changing, even though it wasn’t his life being impacted. It wasn’t that he wasn’t happy for his friends. They were happy. That made him happy. But for the first time since the beginning of their friendship, he was on the outside looking in.  
  
  His friends would vehemently dispute that. They were his family. Much more so than his own batshit crazy family whom he spent most of his time avoiding. Gabe, Mia, Jace and Bethany, but especially Gabe and Jace, would deny that Ash was on the periphery now. They were his brothers in all the ways that counted. More than blood. Their bond was unbreakable. But it had changed. So in fact he was on the periphery. Still a part, but in a much different, smaller way.  
  
  For years their motto had been play hard and live free. Being in a relationship changed a man. It changed his priorities. Ash got that. He understood it. He’d think less of Gabe and Jace if their women weren’t their priority. But it left Ash out of the loop. The third wheel. And it wasn’t a comfortable place to be.  
  
  It was especially hard because, until Bethany, Ash and Jace had shared most of their women. More often than not, they fucked the same women. It sounded asinine that Ash wouldn’t know how to function outside a threesome relationship, but there it was.  
  
  He was restless and edgy, in search of something, he had no idea what. It wasn’t that he wanted what Gabe and Jace had—or maybe he did and refused to acknowledge it. He just knew he wasn’t himself, and he didn’t like that fact.  
  
  He was focused. Knew exactly what he wanted at all times and had the wealth and power to make it happen. There were no shortage of women who’d be more than willing to give Ash what he needed or wanted. But what was the point when he himself had no clue what it was he wanted or needed at present?  
  
  He scanned the park, taking in the baby strollers being pushed by mothers and nannies. He tried to picture himself with children and nearly shuddered at the thought. He was thirty-eight, almost thirty-nine, a time when most men had already settled down and produced offspring. But he’d spent all of his twenties and a good chunk of his thirties busting his ass with his partners to make their business the success it was now. Without using his family’s money, their connections, and especially without their help.  
  
  Maybe that was why they hated him so much now. Because he’d thumbed his nose at them and basically told them to fuck off. But the biggest sin he’d committed was in making more of a success of himself without them. He had more wealth and power than even the old man did. His grandfather. For that matter, what had the rest of his family ever done but live off the old man’s largess? His grandfather had sold his successful business when Ash was still a boy. None of his family had worked a day in their lives.  
  
  He shook his head. Fucking leeches, the lot of them. He didn’t need them. Damn sure didn’t want them. And now that he had surpassed them—and his grandfather—he sure as hell wasn’t going to allow them back into his life to reap the benefits of riding his star.  
  
  He turned to go because he had shit to do that didn’t include standing around in a damn park self-reflecting like he was in need of a shrink. He had to get his act together and start focusing on the one thing that hadn’t changed. Business. HCM Global Resorts had projects in various stages of work. The Paris hotel was a done deal after their having to work fast to replace investors that had backed out. Things were moving along and progressing well. This wasn’t the time for him to drop the ball, especially when Gabe and Jace couldn’t give work the time they had in the past. Ash was the only one not distracted by his personal life, so he had to step up. Take some of the slack for his friends so they could enjoy having a life outside of work.  
  
  As he started to stride back in the direction he’d come, he saw a young woman sitting alone at one of the tables outside of the primary traffic area. He stopped mid-step and let his gaze settle more fully on her, taking in her appearance. Long blond hair that drifted just so with the breeze, revealing a startlingly beautiful face with striking eyes that he could see even from the distance at which he stood.  
  
  She was wearing a funky long skirt that swirled with the wind, baring the long expanse of one leg. Blingy flip-flops adorned her feet and he could see the bright pink polish on her toes and a toe ring that sparkled when she moved her foot to shift position. The sun caught on a silvery ankle bracelet, drawing even more attention to her slender leg.  
  
  She was busy sketching, her brow furrowed in concentration as her pencil flew over the page, and beside her was a huge bag stuffed full, with rolled-up papers extending from the top.  
  
  But what most caught his attention was the choker she wore around her neck. It didn’t fit her. He made that instant assessment. It was tight around her neck, resting just at the hollow of her delicate throat. But it didn’t fit her. It didn’t reflect her at all.  
  
  It was gaudy on her. A diamond choker, obviously expensive and probably not fake, but it didn’t go with the rest of her. It stood out, out of place. His curiosity was piqued because when he saw a piece of jewelry like that on a woman, it meant something far different than it did to most people and he was seized with interest to know if it was indeed a collar, or if it was just an ornament, chosen by her. And if it was a collar, the man who’d chosen it for her had done a piss-poor job. The man didn’t know her, or maybe he didn’t care to ensure that such an important adornment suited the woman he called his own.  
  
  If Ash could make that judgment after mere moments of studying her, then how the hell could the man making love to her not see the same? Maybe the collar was more a reflection of her dominant, which was arrogant and idiotic. A collar should represent his care of his submissive, how in touch with her he was, and it should fit the woman wearing it.  
  
  He was making a hell of a lot of assumptions. It could just be a simple necklace the woman had chosen herself. But to a man like Ash, that piece of jewelry meant something more than just an accessory.  
  
  How long he stood watching her, he didn’t know, but, as if sensing his gaze, hers lifted to meet his and her eyes widened and something like panic entered her expression. Then she hastily slammed her sketch pad closed and began to shove it into her bag. She half rose, still stuffing things into that huge bag, and he realized she  
was leaving.  
  
  Before he was even aware of it, he hurried forward, intrigued. Adrenaline rushed through his veins. The hunt. Discovery. Challenge. Interest. He wanted to know who this woman was, and what that collar she wore meant.  
  
  And even as he strode toward her, he knew that if it did mean what he thought it did, he was trespassing on another man’s territory, and furthermore, he didn’t give one fuck.  
  
  Poaching another dominant’s submissive was one of those unwritten no-nos, but then Ash had never been one for rules. At least the ones he himself didn’t make. And this woman was beautiful. Intriguing. And perhaps exactly what he was looking for. How would he know unless he got to her before she bailed?  
  
  He was nearly to her when she whirled around, bag in hand, obviously preparing to walk away, and she nearly bumped headlong into him. Yeah, he was absolutely invading her space, and he’d be lucky if she didn’t scream the park down. He probably looked like some stalker about to attack.  
  
  He heard her quick intake of breath as she took a step back, banging the bag into the chair she’d vacated. The bag tipped over, coming loose from her grip, and the contents spilled, pencils, brushes and papers flying everywhere.  
  
  “Damn it!” she muttered.  
  
  She bent immediately, grabbing for the papers, and he chased after one that had been caught by the wind, taking it several feet away.  
  
  “I’ll get them,” she called. “Please don’t trouble yourself. ”  
  
  He captured the drawing and picked it up, turning back to her.  
  
  “It’s no trouble at all. I’m sorry if I startled you. ”  
  
  She let out a shaky laugh as she extended her hand for the paper. “You did that for sure. ”  
  
  He glanced down, taking in the drawing as he started to hand it over to her and then blinked in surprise when he saw himself on the paper.  
  
  “What the hell?” he murmured, ignoring her hasty grab for the drawing.  
  
  “Please just give it back,” she said, her voice soft and urgent.  
  
  She sounded scared, like he was going to freak out, but he was more mesmerized by the small expanse of her side that had been bared by the loose-fitting top when she’d reached for the paper.  
  
  On her right side he’d glimpsed a tattoo that was vibrant and colorful. Like her. The brief glimpse he’d gotten told him it was flowery, almost like a vine, and that it likely extended a hell of a lot farther up or down her body. Maybe both. He wished like hell he could see more of it, but she let her arm drop and the hem of her shirt settled back to the waistband of that full skirt, depriving him of further view.  
  
  “Why were you drawing me?” he asked curiously.  
  
  Color invaded her cheeks, making her skin rosy. She had fair skin, just barely kissed by the sun, but with her hair and those gorgeous aquamarine eyes, it looked beautiful. She was beautiful. And evidently very talented.  
  
  She’d drawn him perfectly. He’d had no difficulty in recognizing himself in the pencil drawing. His thoughtful expression, the distant look in his eyes. She’d drawn him as he’d stood there, hands shoved into his pockets. That moment of self-reflection, and clearly that was evident in the drawing. It made him feel awkwardly vulnerable that a complete stranger had been able to capture his mood in just a few moments. That she’d seen him in that vulnerable moment and had picked up on what he hid from everyone else in the world.  
  
  “It was just an impulse,” she defended. “I draw a lot of people. Things. Whatever captures my attention. ”  
  
  He smiled, never dropping his gaze from hers. Her eyes were so expressive, capable of swallowing a man whole. And that damn choker stared back at him, taunting him with the possibilities.  
  
  “So you’re saying I caught your attention. ”  
  
  She flushed again. It was a guilty flush, but also one that was telling. She was checking him out every bit as much as he was checking her out. Perhaps more subtly, but then subtlety had never been one of his strong points.  
  
  “You seemed out of place,” she blurted. “You have very strong features. I was itching to get them down on paper. You have an interesting face and it was obvious you had a lot on your mind. I find people are a lot more open when they think no one is watching them. If you’d been posing, the picture wouldn’t have been the same. ”  
  
  “It’s very good,” he said slowly as he dropped his gaze to once more take in the drawing. “You have a lot of talent. ”  
  
  “Can I have it back now?” she asked. “I’m late. ”  
  
  He looked back up, lifting his eyebrow in question. “You didn’t appear to be leaving until you saw me coming toward you. ”  
  
  “That was several minutes ago, and I wasn’t late then. Now I am. ”  
  
  “What are you late for?”  
  
  Her brows drew together in consternation and then her eyes flashed in annoyance. “I don’t think that’s any of your business. ”  
  
  “Ash,” he said at her pause at the end. “My name is Ash. ”  
  
  She nodded but didn’t say his name. And right then he’d have given anything to hear his name on her lips.  
  
  He reached forward, brushing his fingers over the collar at her throat. “This have anything to do with what you’re late for?”  
She took a step back, her frown deepening.  
  
  “Your Dom waiting for you?”  
  
  Her eyes widened and her fingers automatically went to the collar where his fingers had been just seconds before.  
  
  “What’s your name?” he asked, when she remained silent. “I gave you mine. The polite thing to do is return the favor. ”  
  
  “Josie,” she said barely above a whisper. “Josie Carlysle. ”  
  
  “And who owns you, Josie?”  
  
  Her eyes narrowed then and she clutched her bag, shoving the remainder of her pencils into it. “Nobody owns me. ”  
  
  “Then did I misunderstand the significance of that collar you’re wearing?”  
  
  Her fingers brushed over it again, and it made him itchy. He wanted to remove it. It wasn’t right for her. A collar should be carefully chosen for a submissive. Something that matched her personality. Something made especially for her. And not just any woman.  
  
  “You didn’t misunderstand,” she said in a husky voice that sent shivers down his spine. Her voice alone would seduce a man in a matter of seconds. “But nobody owns me, Ash. ”  
  
  And there it was. His name on her lips. It hit him deep, filling him with inexplicable satisfaction. He wanted to hear it again. When he was pleasuring her. When he had his hands and mouth on her body, drawing whispery sighs of contentment from her.  
  
  He lifted one eyebrow. “Then do you misunderstand the significance of that collar?”  
  
  She laughed. “No, but he doesn’t own me. Nobody owns me. It was a gift. One I choose to wear. Nothing more. ”  
  
  He leaned in, and this time she didn’t back away. Her gaze fixed on him, curiosity gleaming, and even anticipation. She felt it too. That magnetic pull between them. She’d have to be blind and in denial not to feel it.  
  
  “If you wore my collar, you’d damn well know you belonged to me,” he growled. “Furthermore, you wouldn’t regret for a moment that you gave yourself wholly to me. If you were in my care, you’d definitely belong to me. There’d be no question. And you wouldn’t hesitate when asked who your dominant was. Nor would you say it was a gift like it was nothing more than a piece of jewelry thoughtlessly chosen on a whim. It would mean something, Josie. It would mean fucking everything, and you’d know that. ”  
  
  Her eyes widened and then she laughed again, her eyes twinkling. “Then it’s too bad I don’t belong to you. ”  
  
  With that she turned and hurried away, bag over her shoulder and him still standing there holding the drawing she’d done of him.  
  
  He watched as she walked away from him, hair sliding down her back and lifting in the wind, a glimpse of the flip-flops and the ankle bracelet that tinkled softly when she moved. Then he glanced down at the drawing in his hand.  
  
  “Too bad indeed,” he murmured.  
  
  Chapter two  
  
  Ash sat in his office, door closed, brooding over the report in front of him. It wasn’t a business file. No financial chart. No email he had to respond to. It was a file on one Josie Carlysle.  
  
  He’d acted quickly, calling in a favor from the same agency he’d used to do a background check on Bethany, which had solidly pissed Jace off at the time. They were good, and, more importantly, they were fast.  
  
  After his meeting with Josie in the park, he hadn’t been able to shake her from his mind. Hadn’t been able to shake his fixation with her, and he wasn’t even sure what he’d call it, other than he was acting a lot like Jace had when he’d first met Bethany, and Ash had been quick to call his friend on the stupidity and rashness of his actions then. What would Jace think if he knew that Ash was basically stalking Josie?  
  
  Jace would think he’d lost his damn mind. Just as Ash had thought Jace had lost his—and well, he had—over Bethany.  
  
  According to his report, Josie was twenty-eight. An art grad who lived in a basement studio apartment in a brownstone on the Upper East Side. The apartment was leased to her. Not another man. In fact there was little evidence in the report of this other man’s presence, other than him arriving to pick her up at different intervals. The report only spanned a few days, since it had only been since then that Ash had met Josie and immediately requested the information.  
  
  More often than not, she spent time in the park, drawing or painting. Some of her work was displayed in a small art gallery on Madison, but nothing had sold, at least in the amount of time since Ash had someone keeping an eye on her. She also designed funky jewelry and had a website and an online shop where she took orders for some of her handmade stuff.  
  
  From all appearances, she was a free spirit. No regular work hours. No regular schedule at all. She came and went seemingly on a whim. Though it had only been a few days, it seemed that she was also a loner. His guy hadn’t spotted her with anyone other than the man Ash assumed was her Dom.  
  
  It didn’t make sense to him. If Josie was his, he damn sure wouldn’t spend so little time with her, nor would she be alone so much. It appeared to him that Josie was an itch this guy was scratching and that either he, or she, didn’t take the relationship that seriously.  
  
  Was it all a game?  
  
  Not that Ash had anything against people doing whatever the fuck they wanted, but in his world, submission wasn’t a game. It was everything. He didn’t play games. Didn’t have time for them, and they just pissed him off. If a woman wasn’t into it with him, then he was out. If she wanted a fucking game where she played at being submissive, complete with cute role-playing and yanking his chain to earn a punishment, he cut her loose quick.  
  
  But then most of the women he’d fucked, he’d fucked with Jace. They had their rules. The women were clued in from the start. Bethany had been a complete game changer, and a complete rule breaker. Jace hadn’t wanted to share, and Ash got that. He hadn’t at first, but he got it now. But it didn’t mean that he didn’t miss that connection with his best friend.  
  
  On the other hand, with Jace out of the way, Ash was solely in control. He didn’t have to worry about tripping over his best friend, pissing him off, or playing by anyone else’s rules but his own.  
  
  That appealed to him. It appealed a damn lot. He’d always known that people misunderstood his personality. Looking at the three of them, Gabe, Jace and Ash, people assumed Ash was the easygoing one. The “I don’t give a fuck” kind. Laid-back. Maybe even a pushover.  
  
  They were all wrong.  
  
  Of any of them, he was the most intense, and he knew that about himself. He’d held back when he and Jace were with the same woman, because he knew he’d take it a hell of a lot further than Jace ever would. So he played it Jace’s way and held that part of himself in check. The part that would take over completely. And, well, there hadn’t ever been a woman who tempted him to let that part of himself go.  
  
  Until now.  
  
  And it was stupid. He didn’t know Josie. He knew about her, yeah. The report was detailed. But he didn’t know her. Didn’t know if she’d even respond to what Ash would give her. What he would take.  
  
  That was the biggie. What he would take. Because he’d take a lot. He’d give a lot, but his demands would seem extreme even to someone well-versed in the lifestyle he lived.  
  
  He glanced down at the report again, pondering his next move. He already had a man on her. The idea of her being alone so much bothered him. Not that he didn’t think it was perfectly okay for a woman to do whatever the hell she wanted in the city. But it bothered him for Josie. A lot. Would her supposed Dom even have a fucking clue where she was during the day? Did he give her protection? Or did he just hook up with her when he wanted someone to fuck?  
  
  A low growl rumbled in his throat and he swallowed it back. He needed to calm the fuck down and get his shit together. This woman was nothing to him. But even as he thought it, he knew he was a damn liar. She was something. He just wasn’t sure what yet.  
  
  His cell phone rang, and he looked down, frowning when he saw the contact. It was the man he had watching Josie.  
  
  “Ash,” he answered shortly. />  
  “Mr. McIntyre, this is Johnny. Just wanted to let you know what I just observed. With what you told me, I figured you’d want to know what’s going down. ”  
  
  Ash sat up in his chair, his frown deepening. “What’s wrong? Is she hurt?”  
  
  “No, sir. She just came out of a pawnshop. She sold some jewelry. I was in the shop, heard her talking to the pawnbroker. Said she needed the cash to make rent. He asked her if she wanted to sell it or pawn it and she said sell because she doubted she’d have the money to get it back unless something changed. Didn’t say what that change would be, but thought you’d want to know what she did. ”  
  
  Anger splintered his mind. What the fuck was Josie doing hocking jewelry in a goddamn pawnshop? If she needed cash, then why the hell wasn’t her Dom providing for her? Why wasn’t he protecting her better? The hell she’d be in a fucking pawnshop if she belonged to him.  
  
  “Buy it,” Ash clipped out. “Buy every piece. I don’t care what it costs. And you bring it to me. ”  
  
  “Yes, sir,” Johnny said.  
  
  Ash hung up and then leaned back in his chair, his mind working furiously. Then he rose abruptly, his phone to his ear calling for his driver to meet him in front of the office building.  
  
  He nearly ran over Gabe in the hallway.  
  
  “Ash, you got a second?” Gabe called when Ash continued down the hall.  
  
  “Not now,” Ash ground out. “Got shit to do. I’ll tag you later, okay?”  
  
  “Ash?”  
  
  Ash stopped, impatience simmering as he turned to look at his friend. Gabe’s brows were drawn together in concentration and concern gleamed in his eyes.  
  
  “Everything okay?”  
  
  Ash nodded. “Yeah, fine. Look, I’ve got to run. I’ll catch up later. ”  
  
  Gabe nodded, but there was doubt in his eyes. No way Ash was sharing what was on his mind. Gabe had enough to keep him occupied with his wedding. Shit, that was tomorrow. Which meant Gabe probably wanted to talk shit about the wedding and the ceremony.  
  
  Ash stopped at the very end of the hall and called back to Gabe.  
  
  “Everything okay with the wedding? Mia okay? You need anything?”  
  
  Gabe paused at his office door and smiled. “Everything’s fine. Or at least it will be when the fucking ceremony is done and she’s mine. We still on for tonight? Jace is determined to throw me a bachelor party, which is not making Mia happy. I doubt Bethany is any happier, but he swears it’s just drinks at Rick’s and nothing that will piss either woman off. ”  
  
  Damn it. Ash had forgotten about it all. In his preoccupation with Josie he’d put the wedding and the night out with Gabe and Jace solidly out of his mind.  
  
  “Yeah, I’ll be there. Eight, right? I’ll just meet you and Jace there. ”  
  
  Gabe nodded. “Okay, see you then. Hope everything works out. ”  
  
  Gabe was fishing again, but Ash ignored him and turned for the elevator. He didn’t have much time if he was going to make it to the art gallery before it closed.  
  
  • • •  
  
  Ash walked into the small gallery and quickly glanced around. It was apparent that this was a small dealer with not a lot of well-known artists displayed. He probably dealt with independent artists. Those yet to be discovered. Those displaying in hopes of being discovered.  
  
  His eyes settled immediately on a painting on the wall, and he knew without confirming that it was one of Josie’s works. It just looked like her. Bright. Vibrant. Carefree. He felt her when he looked at the painting. Saw her, remembered the way she smelled and when she’d smiled, those ocean eyes he could drown in. Yeah, it was definitely hers. He wasn’t wrong about this.  
  
  “Can I help you?”  
  
  Ash turned to see an older man smiling at him. He was dressed in a worn suit with scuffed shoes and wore glasses that drew attention to the lines in his forehead and around his eyes.  
  
  “Josie Carlysle,” Ash said bluntly. “You display her work here?”  
  
  The man looked surprised but then smiled again and turned, gesturing toward the wall. “Yes, I do. She’s good. Not focused though. I think it’s why she hasn’t caught on. She’s too all over the place and her style hasn’t emerged yet. One that’s identifiable, if you understand my meaning. ”  
  
  “No, I don’t,” Ash said impatiently. “I like it. I like her work. Is that all you have, there on the wall?”  
  
  The man’s eyebrows went up. “No. Not at all. I have several pieces of hers. I only take a few at a time. I have to utilize the space to display what sells, and I’ve only sold one or two of her pieces, regrettably. I’ve actually cut back on the work of hers I display, just because it isn’t moving well. ”  
  
  “I want them all. ”  
  
  The surprise was still evident in the man’s face but he hurried immediately to the wall to take down the painting that had first caught Ash’s attention. It was framed. Not well, and he’d definitely replace the frame with something more worthy of her talent. But first he had to buy up all her work and let the man know that anything else that Josie brought in was his.

1n2kvtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/grc/comments/1n2kvtj/what_is_an_acceptable_use_policy_aup_best/,What is an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)? Best Practices and Template,"*I created this article to help those looking to write an effective AUP for their organization.*

*Folks, feel free to provide feedback on your AUP experiences or additional best practices you've discovered!*

Think of your Acceptable Use Policy as a friendly roadmap that helps your team navigate technology use confidently and securely. Rather than a list of restrictions, a well-crafted AUP is actually an empowering document that gives employees clarity on what they can do, how to do it safely, and why it matters for everyone's success.

A good AUP serves as a starting point for employees to understand expectations around technology use, protects both the company and individuals, and creates a foundation of trust that enables better business relationships with clients and partners.

# The 6 Components Every AUP Must Include

# 1. Clear Scope and Applicability

Start by clearly defining who this policy helps and what systems it covers. This creates clarity rather than confusion.

**Example approach:** ""This policy applies to all team members, contractors, and partners who access our company systems, helping everyone understand how to use our technology resources safely and effectively.""

# 2. Device and Network Security Guidelines

Your team works from various locations: home offices, coworking spaces, coffee shops. Your AUP should provide helpful guidance for staying secure everywhere.

**Key areas to address:**

* Guidelines for personal use (reasonable and realistic)
* Software installation recommendations
* Wi-Fi security tips for remote work

# 3. Communication and Collaboration Best Practices

Help your team understand how to communicate professionally while representing the company well.

**Include guidance on:**

* What information can be shared externally
* Professional communication standards
* Social media guidelines that protect both personal and company interests

# 4. Internet and Email Guidelines

Based on your reference document, this section should balance business needs with reasonable personal use.

**Key principles:**

* Business use is primary, reasonable personal use is acceptable
* Professional communication standards
* Security-conscious browsing practices

**From your document:** Personal use is permitted when it doesn't affect business performance, doesn't create security threats, and stays within reasonable bounds.

# 5. Remote Work and Privacy Guidelines

Since most teams work remotely at least part-time, provide clear, helpful guidance for maintaining security and privacy off-site.

**Essential elements:**

* Creating appropriate work environments
* Protecting company equipment and data
* Equipment security when traveling

**Positive approach:** ""When working remotely, choose environments that allow you to maintain confidentiality, this protects both our clients' trust and your professional reputation.""

# 6. Incident Reporting and Support

Frame this as a support system rather than a punishment mechanism.

**Include:**

* Who to contact for help (specific roles and contact methods)
* Resources available for support

**Supportive language:** ""If you encounter any security concerns or need guidance, our IT team is here to help. Quick reporting helps us address issues faster and protect everyone.""

# The 4 Biggest AUP Mistakes

# Mistake #1: The ""Everything is Forbidden"" Approach

I see policies that ban personal email, personal phone calls, and basically any human behavior. This doesn't make you more secure. It makes your policy irrelevant.

**Reality check:** Your sales team is going to check personal email. Your developers are going to Stack Overflow questions. Write policies that acknowledge real-world usage while protecting what matters.

# Mistake #2: Ignoring Remote Work Reality

Too many AUPs were written in 2015 when everyone worked in an office. If your policy doesn't address home offices, coworking spaces, and personal devices, it's worthless.

**Fix:** Explicitly address remote work scenarios. ""When working from locations outside company offices, employees must ensure their workspace is private during customer calls and lock their screen when stepping away.""

# Mistake #3: Making it Impossible to Find or Understand

I've seen huge AUPs buried in employee handbooks. I've seen policies written in legal language that require a law degree to understand.

**Solution:** Keep it simple, use plain English, and make it easily accessible. If employees can't find it or understand it, compliance is impossible.

# Mistake #4: Ignoring AI Tools

Your employees are already using AI tools like ChatGPT for writing, GitHub Copilot for coding, etc. Without clear guidelines, they're making decisions about what data is safe to share with AI systems, and those decisions might be putting your business at risk.

**Solution:** Clear AI guidelines prevent accidental data exposure that could violate customer contracts or compliance requirements.

Our birthdays are literally one day apart and for most of our friendship we shared celebrations. Backstory - I moved abroad when I was 19 and she moved abroad when she was 20. I’ve been with my high school love since 17 and we moved together, whereas she moved, met a guy and they got married in less than a year. Fast forward to 2 years ago. I found out I was pregnant and the next day my friend tells me she is 12 weeks pregnant. Being it that I didn’t know how far along I was, I decided to wait to tell her in person when I saw her 2 months later. The day I saw her she was with 2 of their friends I’ve never met. The whole lunch we talk and make fuss over her because she’s pregnant and I wait for a question of “how are you doing” or something along the lines so I can bring up that I’m pregnant too and as we got to dessert, I was tired of waiting and just announced it. Her friends had a bigger reaction to the news than my “best” friend. She seemed almost disappointed that she wasn’t the only one that was pregnant. We went for coffee after and didn’t really talk much about the pregnancies after me announcing. She spoke about it over messages but nothing on the day I saw her (bare in mind this is the first time I saw her in over 2 years due to the distance). We have our babies 6 weeks apart - I had a girl and she had a boy. I found out 8 months postpartum that i was pregnant again (planned) and decided to tell her over message because I didn’t feel like another forced reaction. She exclaimed that she was happy for us and the very next message proceeded to tell me how her and her husband had been trying to get pregnant again for almost 3 months. She expressed how she was jealous and that she wanted to be pregnant too again. 2 months later she found out she was pregnant. Things now kind of feel like a bit of a competition, I feel like I can’t tell her anything about my daughter without it being met with something about her son. Or I can’t talk to her about anything in the pregnancy because she follows it up with something about how she’s jealous I’m closer to meeting my baby than she is. She found out she’s having a girl and I found out I’m having a boy. Then today she tells me how she’s having her baby shower on the day of my due date. I don’t want to feel like this but I can’t help but feel like it’s a huge “coincidence”. I know the world doesn’t revolve around me but I just feel like there’s been so many of these types of things over our friendship in the past 10 years that I can’t shake this feeling anymore.

It seems as though her sole purpose in life is to ""bust"" or at least loves to harass homeless males. There's a circle most homeless people migrate daily, safe harbor (or goodwill in) to Methodist for breakfast, then  jubilee house for coffee, then a lot end up in the library or the park behind it until people start heading back to shelter. And any given point in the day this person actively out of her car asking people questions or parked in her patrol car as close to ppl as she can get that are simply passing time or conversing with others. Sure sometimes people are drinking and police presence is needed, but most of the time they are not. Anywhere you go, she's there, watching .... Waiting..... 

    I don't travel in a group, or associate with many people, I don't drink in the park, I haven't given her a reason to bother me but she's stared me down multiple times and I know she'd just love to run my name. She came in to jubilee house and was flirting with a staff member and when I was leaving she sized me up with a look of disdain on her face.

If you did or you saw her at work, I think you'd agree she's just a little too gung ho and or emotionally involved ( a man hater) the other day I watched her stop, detain someone for having a bag of empty cans, she was trying to say he just finished drinking, (he was just recycling) and throw his nicotine and THC vape in a dumpster and telling him to get lost after running his name and having to let him go. Told him if he came back to get them she'd arrest him. This isn't about policing bad actors it's a personal war on the homeless.

1n2kueh,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n2kueh/the_art_of_authentic_living_how_genuine/,🌟 The Art of Authentic Living: How Genuine Self-Expression Opens Extraordinary Doors,"

In our fast-paced world filled with endless distractions and superficial connections, there's one timeless principle that can transform your entire life experience: becoming the most authentic version of yourself. This isn't about following trends or copying others—it's about discovering and expressing your genuine nature in ways that create meaningful impact.

**🌍 Standing Out in a Crowded World**

Picture this: you're one person among 7 billion others on this planet. Every day, countless individuals are competing for attention, opportunities, and recognition. What makes the difference between those who fade into the background and those who attract extraordinary experiences and connections?

The answer lies in authenticity.

Think about the most memorable people you've encountered in your life. Chances are, they weren't trying to be someone else. They possessed a genuine quality that made them magnetic—a real, unfiltered expression of who they truly were beneath all the social masks and expectations.

**💎 The Rarity of Genuine Expression**

In a world where most people are busy imitating others, playing roles they think will get them ahead, or hiding their true selves out of fear, genuine authenticity becomes incredibly rare and valuable. It's like finding a diamond in a field of glass—it immediately catches attention and commands respect.

When you commit to being genuinely yourself, you're not just another face in the crowd. You become someone who stands out naturally, without effort or pretense. This authentic energy attracts opportunities, relationships, and experiences that align with your true nature.

**🚀 The Challenge That Most People Avoid**

Here's what's fascinating: while billions of people engage in the same daily routines—scrolling social media, complaining about circumstances, blaming external factors for their problems, or pursuing superficial goals—very few choose the more challenging path of authentic self-development.

Why is authenticity so challenging? Because it requires:

🔸 **Honest Self-Reflection**: Looking at yourself without filters or excuses
🔸 **Courage to Be Different**: Standing by your values even when others disagree  
🔸 **Consistency**: Maintaining your genuine nature regardless of circumstances
🔸 **Growth Mindset**: Continuously evolving while staying true to your core
🔸 **Vulnerability**: Showing up as yourself, imperfections and all

**🎯 What Makes Someone Truly Magnetic**

The individuals who attract extraordinary opportunities and connections share common traits that go beyond surface-level characteristics:

**Genuine Growth Orientation**: They're not just focused on personal advancement—they're committed to evolving in ways that naturally uplift everyone around them. When you meet someone like this, you can sense their authentic desire to improve not just their own life, but the lives of others.

**Unwavering Authenticity**: They remain consistent in their values and behavior regardless of external pressures. This reliability makes them trustworthy and magnetic to others seeking genuine connections.

**Natural Leadership**: Without trying to control or manipulate, they inspire others through their example. Their authentic expression gives others permission to be genuine too.

**Purpose-Driven Action**: Their goals align with their values, creating a powerful coherence that others can feel and respect.

**🌱 The Practical Path to Authentic Living**

So how do you develop this magnetic authenticity in your daily life? Here are actionable steps you can implement immediately:

**Morning Authenticity Check** ☀️
Start each day by asking yourself: ""What would I do today if I weren't trying to impress anyone or avoid anyone's disapproval?"" Let this guide your choices throughout the day.

**Values Alignment Practice** 🧭
Identify your top 5 core values. Before making any significant decision, check whether your choice aligns with these values. This creates consistency and builds trust with yourself and others.

**Honest Communication** 💬
Practice expressing your thoughts and feelings honestly, but respectfully. Instead of saying what you think others want to hear, share your authentic perspective while remaining considerate.

**Embrace Your Uniqueness** 🦋
Stop trying to fit in. Identify what makes you different and celebrate those qualities. Your unique combination of traits, experiences, and perspectives is your greatest asset.

**Growth Over Comfort** 🌿
Choose activities and relationships that challenge you to grow rather than those that keep you comfortable. Authentic people are always evolving.

**Service Mindset** 🤝
Look for ways to contribute positively to others' lives without expecting anything in return. Genuine service creates natural magnetism.

**🔄 The Ripple Effect of Authenticity**

When you commit to authentic living, something remarkable happens. You don't just change your own experience—you create a ripple effect that influences everyone around you. Authentic people give others permission to be genuine too, creating an upward spiral of positive energy and meaningful connections.

This isn't about becoming perfect. It's about becoming real. It's about showing up as yourself, flaws and all, while continuously working to become the best version of that authentic self.

**⚡ The Energy of Genuine Expression**

There's a unique energy that surrounds authentic individuals. You've probably felt it when meeting someone who was completely comfortable in their own skin. They weren't performing or pretending—they were simply being themselves with confidence and grace.

This energy is magnetic because it's rare. In a world full of artificial interactions and superficial connections, genuine expression stands out like a beacon. It attracts opportunities, relationships, and experiences that align with your true nature.

**🎭 Breaking Free from Social Masks**

Most of us wear different masks for different situations—one for work, another for family, another for friends. While some adaptation to social contexts is natural and necessary, problems arise when we lose touch with who we really are beneath all these masks.

The goal isn't to be identical in every situation, but to maintain a consistent core of authentic values and genuine expression that shows up regardless of context. This creates a powerful personal brand based on reliability and trustworthiness.

**🏆 The Long-Term Benefits**

People who commit to authentic living consistently report:

🌟 **Deeper Relationships**: When you're genuine, you attract others who appreciate the real you
🌟 **Increased Opportunities**: Authentic individuals are remembered and recommended
🌟 **Inner Peace**: No more exhausting pretense or worry about maintaining false images  
🌟 **Natural Confidence**: When you accept yourself, others do too
🌟 **Meaningful Success**: Achievements feel more satisfying when they align with your true nature
🌟 **Reduced Stress**: Living authentically eliminates the mental energy drain of maintaining facades

**🌈 Practical Daily Applications**

**At Work**: Instead of just agreeing with everything, contribute your genuine perspective in meetings. Share ideas that reflect your unique viewpoint and experience.

**In Relationships**: Express your needs and boundaries clearly. Show interest in others' authentic selves rather than trying to impress them.

**In Decision Making**: Choose paths that align with your values, even if they're more challenging or less popular.

**In Conflict**: Address issues directly and respectfully rather than avoiding confrontation or being passive-aggressive.

**In Goal Setting**: Pursue objectives that genuinely excite and motivate you, not just what looks good to others.

**🔮 The Future-Proof Nature of Authenticity**

Here's something powerful to consider: while technology, trends, and social norms will continue to evolve dramatically over the coming decades and centuries, the value of authentic human connection and genuine character will remain constant.

Artificial intelligence can replicate many human capabilities, but it cannot replicate the unique combination of experiences, values, and perspectives that make you authentically you. Your genuine self is your most future-proof asset.

**🎯 The Ultimate Test**

Want to know if you're living authentically? Ask yourself these questions:

• Would you be comfortable if everyone in your life knew everything about your thoughts, values, and motivations?
• Do your actions consistently align with your stated values?
• Are you pursuing goals that genuinely matter to you, or goals you think should matter?
• Do you feel energized or drained after social interactions?
• Are you growing in ways that feel natural and sustainable?

**💪 Building Authentic Confidence**

True confidence doesn't come from external validation or achievements—it comes from self-acceptance and the knowledge that you're living in alignment with your authentic nature. This type of confidence is unshakeable because it's based on something real and internal rather than external circumstances.

When you know who you are and live accordingly, criticism loses much of its sting, and praise feels good but isn't necessary for your self-worth. This balanced relationship with external feedback creates a stable foundation for continued growth and success.

**🌊 Riding the Waves of Life Authentically**

Life will always present challenges, setbacks, and unexpected changes. The question isn't whether you'll face difficulties—it's how you'll respond to them while maintaining your authentic nature.

Authentic people don't pretend challenges don't affect them. Instead, they process experiences honestly, learn from them, and continue moving forward in alignment with their values. This approach builds resilience and creates trust with others who know they can count on your consistency even during tough times.

**🎨 Your Unique Contribution**

Every authentic individual contributes something unique to the world. Your particular combination of experiences, talents, perspectives, and values creates a one-of-a-kind offering that no one else can provide.

The world needs your authentic contribution. There are problems only you can solve, people only you can reach, and impact only you can create—but only when you're being genuinely yourself.

**🏃‍♀️ Taking Action Today**

Authenticity isn't a destination—it's a daily practice. Start small but start today:

1. **Choose one area** of your life where you've been less than genuine
2. **Make one authentic choice** in that area today
3. **Notice how it feels** to express your genuine nature
4. **Build on that feeling** by making more authentic choices
5. **Share your authentic self** with one person who matters to you

Remember, becoming authentic doesn't mean becoming perfect. It means becoming real. It means showing up as yourself, growing continuously, and contributing your unique gifts to the world around you.

**🌟 The Magnetic Power of Genuine Living**

When you commit to authentic living, you become a magnet for extraordinary experiences. Not because you're trying to attract them, but because authentic individuals naturally align with opportunities and connections that match their genuine nature.

This isn't magic—it's the natural result of consistent, values-based living that creates trust, respect, and meaningful relationships with others who appreciate genuine character.

The path isn't always easy, but it's always worth it. In a world hungry for authentic connection and real leadership, your genuine self is exactly what the world needs.

Start today. Be authentic. Watch how your life transforms when you dare to be genuinely, consistently, courageously yourself.

Your authentic self is your greatest gift to the world—and the key to attracting the extraordinary life you're meant to live. 🌟

Hope you're all having a day where the juice stays in the cup and the toddler tantrums are at a minimum. 😄

I wanted to talk about something I've been really trying to focus on lately: mindful parenting. That term gets thrown around a lot, but for me, it’s honestly just about trying to be *present*. Not just physically in the room while scrolling through my phone, but truly *there*. It’s those moments when you actually get down on the floor to build that Lego tower instead of just saying ""that's nice, honey"" from the couch. It’s taking a deep breath before reacting to a spilled gallon of milk.

But let's be real—this is incredibly hard in our digital world. Our phones are constantly pinging with work emails, social updates, and let's be honest, those memes we just can't resist. I can't count the number of times I've been half-listening to my kid's story while simultaneously answering a text. I always walk away from those moments feeling guilty, like I’ve missed something precious.

The biggest challenge for me has been finding that balance. How do we stay connected in this modern age without letting it disconnect us from the little people right in front of us? I don't think the answer is to throw our phones in the ocean (tempting as that may be!), but to create little pockets of intentional, tech-free connection.

I've been making a conscious effort to have ""phone-free zones"" during certain times, like during meals and the bedtime routine. It’s not always perfect, but even just putting it face-down on silent makes a huge difference in my attention span. It’s amazing what you hear when you’re actually listening!

This whole journey got me thinking and researching more, and I ended up putting together a list of practical, real-world tips that are actually helping my family. I just published an article called **""**[10 Essential Tips for Mindful Parenting in a Digital World](https://doparenting.com/10-essential-tips-for-mindful-parenting-in-a-digital-world/)**""** that dives deeper into this.

It covers everything from setting healthy tech boundaries for *ourselves* to fun ways to engage with our kids offline. If you're also struggling to find that balance, I think you might find a few nuggets of wisdom in there.

What about all of you? What’s one small thing you do to be more present and mindful with your kids amidst the daily chaos? I’d love to hear your stories and tips—we’re all in this together!

Sending you all calm and coffee.

Porn became a daily escape. Weed became a crutch just to keep from having seizures when I tried to stop drinking. Every day and every night, I was chasing something to numb me.

I first tried weed at 17 and thought it wasn’t dangerous. By the time I was 24, my life was consumed—weed, alcohol, food, porn, cocaine, meth. I was chasing pleasure anywhere I could find it. But it all left me empty. I hit rock bottom after cheating on my girlfriend of two and a half years. I remember crying out to God, broken and bawling my eyes out, not even understanding why I kept doing what I hated.

My parents stepped in. They gave me three options: live on the streets, try to piece things together in my mess of debt, or go to **A Better Way Ministries**. I didn’t like those choices, but God answered my prayer—I said yes.

The very first night I arrived, Brother Doug and Miss Elizabeth gathered my family into a circle and prayed us in. I knew I needed structure again, and this place gave me that. Waking up at 4:45 AM, devotion, reverence, brotherhood—it was exactly what I needed to reset my life.

The Brotherhood here is different than anything in the world. Outside, people care if it benefits them. Here, it’s real—men loving you enough to pray with you, walk with you, and correct you when you’re slipping. That’s what held me up.

The Florida trip was life-changing. Morning devotions on the beach, coffee with my brothers, and finally baptism. I didn’t force it—God’s timing was perfect. When I came out of the water, I knew He was restoring my hope.

Since being here, the Lord has restored my family’s spiritual health, my patience, and my drive to live again. My mom’s faith is stronger than I’ve ever seen. I wake up now with hope. I know for certain God exists, and every day is about how much I’m willing to give Him.

**A Better Way Ministries has restored my faith, my hope, and my purpose. I’m no longer trapped in addiction—God has given me something real to live for.**",2,1756407089.0,TheTestimonyOfJesus,1,1.0,False

A little backround about me…im 48m about 305 lbs and 5’11. Ive been on blood pressure meds, anxiety meds and cholesterol meds for most of my life (even as a teenager at a normal weight i was on them, thank dad for the genes). Also use CPAP religiously for sleep apnea.

over the last several years my weight has been creeping up…250…260…etc. here I am now over 300 thanks to my desk job and sedentary life. My cardiologist thought id be a good candidate to try these meds. Ive tried nutrisystem, meal programs, shakes but the food noise always wins.

So here i am, my insurance just approved me, and in the near future ill be getting some pens. Im very health anxious and worry about side effects, my gall bladder exploding or my pancreas imploding, pooping, puking, who knows…on these meds. I also wonder if the “delayed gastric emptying”
will affect my bp and anxiety meds? will they take longer to absorb, etc?

Did some scouring on here and understand from my pharmacist im working with that:

1) I need to keep well hydrated to keep things moving
2) Keep my protein intake high, if im not eating as much, hit the protein and and fiber to help keep muscle and keep things moving. 

I found some stuff to put in my amazon shopping cart:

1) ginger drops someone recommended on here for nausea
2) benefiber packets to add to my coffee 
3) a probiotic supplement for my belly. 

I also have a bunch of protein shake meal replacements like soylent drinks to use if im not super hungry. 

Anything else you wonderful people can recommend would be absolute gold. Im nervous about it but excited about the potential results after seeing so many wonderful photos in here. Ill post my own too.

Also, is there a good iphone app to track results and photos?

Thank you all and God bless. I pray this works..i want to feel good again, not tired from walking for 5 minutes….

I've got enough of that from my friends and family and friends and...as grateful as I am for my support system, if I haven't made it abundantly clear here...well, I am honestly fed up to the point of well-intentioned sympathy making me even more upset. (It's not you, it's me, I promise.)

Okay, so:

I have had T1D for 28 years or so now, and I have been through the ringer with it. I have had enough hypoglycemic seizures to be sent to a neurologist and definitively diagnosed with epilepsy as a complication. (I was also shocked) I have struggled with disordered eating and exercise behaviors (primarily in my teens). My blood sugars do not want to stay under control (and I have tried quite literally every strategy that I have come across). And now, I have undeniable signs that I have endometriosis thanks to an 7-8cm endometrioma rupturing and requiring emergency surgery last week (after my regular gyn tried to gaslight me into believing that I don't have it...yay women's healthcare.)

I have not been in the place I want to be with my health and weight for a while, and, full disclosure: the emergency surgery has kickstarted a lot of dormant bad feelings about my body and weight because...well, wouldn't you know it, if someone goes in to mess around with your ovaries, it throws menopause symptoms back at you at the ripe age of 30 (yes, 30!!!) I have gained 10 pounds since surgery when I was already struggle bussing my way to, at the very least, maintain what I could. Which had still not been a healthy weight for me; I still did not exist at a place that made me feel energetic, productive, well-rested, etc. and I just really do want that for myself so badly.

That being said:

- Does anyone know of any specialists in WA that specialize in/have advanced WORKING knowledge T1D, ED recovery, and weight loss? By specialists, I mean dieticians, physicians, personal trainers, and therapists, though perhaps there are others I should be considering and I would hear you out if you thought I should check them out. Send em all to me, even the pricey ones. Would prefer the western side of the state, and hell I'll even dip into Oregon if they're that good. Would also strongly prefer if they had telehealth options (though not required necessarily).
- Has anyone tried a weight loss med with T1D? I know generally that this probably means off-label use. But if anyone has, can you please speak to it if you are comfortable with it? What physician helped you with your prescription? What was your intent when you went on it? What was the actual process of getting that prescription written? How has the med affected you? Did it help with weight loss? Insulin resistance? Other things you have noticed?

Because on top of wanting to lose weight, my insulin resistance is out of whack. I will wake up for work and, I don't know...breathe??? and my blood sugar decides it's time to flip me both of its middle fingers and begins its daily roller coaster ascent. I don't eat or drink a thing and it starts misbehaving. Doesn't matter what settings I plug into my pump. Doesn't matter if I eat zero (and I do mean ZERO) carbs for breakfast, if I eat nothing for breakfast, or if I have a BUNCH of carbs for that matter. I am consistently on my way out the door and my CGM is whining at me before I can even have a god-forsaken sip of coffee. I am set up for a roller coaster and the rest of my busy, active work day is a total toss-up.

Thank you for listening to my rant, I tried to be funny (at least I think I'm funny, idk) so I wouldn't just...rage here, but really I need some help. And I swear, the diabetic crew always comes through for each other. As you can tell...I am exhausted, so thank you in advance for any help you can provide me.",2,1756406843.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,1.0,False

In our fast-paced world, where digital notifications buzz constantly and stress seems to be our default companion, there's something profoundly meaningful about the simple act of wishing someone well. Whether you call it sending good vibes, positive energy, or simply hoping for the best for another person, this fundamental human practice transcends cultural boundaries and speaks to something deep within us all.

## What Does It Really Mean to Share Warmth and Positivity? 🌟

When we talk about sending warmth and brightness to others, we're essentially talking about one of humanity's most beautiful characteristics: our ability to care beyond ourselves. This isn't about mystical forces or supernatural powers—it's about the very real psychological and emotional impact of genuine goodwill.

Think about the last time someone told you they were thinking of you during a difficult period. Remember how that felt? That's the power we're discussing here. It's the recognition that human connection matters, that our thoughts and intentions toward others can create ripples of positivity that extend far beyond what we might imagine.

## The Science Behind Good Intentions 🧠

Research in psychology and neuroscience has shown us fascinating insights about positive thinking and its effects. When we genuinely wish well for others, our brains actually activate the same neural pathways associated with personal happiness and wellbeing. This isn't just feel-good nonsense—it's measurable brain activity.

Studies have demonstrated that people who regularly practice goodwill toward others experience lower levels of stress hormones, improved immune function, and even increased longevity. The act of sending positive thoughts isn't just beneficial for the receiver; it creates a feedback loop of wellness for the sender too.

## Practical Ways to Spread Positivity in Your Daily Life 💫

### Morning Intentions 🌅
Start your day by setting positive intentions for the people in your life. During your morning coffee or tea, spend just two minutes thinking about friends, family members, or even colleagues who might benefit from some extra support today. This simple practice can shift your entire mindset from focusing on your own challenges to recognizing your connection with others.

### The Power of Genuine Compliments 💝
Instead of generic pleasantries, offer specific, heartfelt observations about the people around you. Notice when a coworker handles a difficult situation with grace, when your friend shows particular kindness, or when a family member demonstrates resilience. Acknowledging these moments out loud creates powerful positive reinforcement.

### Digital Wellness Sharing 📱
In our connected world, consider how you use technology to spread positivity. Rather than mindlessly scrolling through social media, make it a habit to send encouraging messages to friends who might need them. A simple ""thinking of you"" text or sharing an article that reminded you of someone can brighten their entire day.

### Active Listening as Gift-Giving 👂
One of the most powerful ways to share warmth with others is through the gift of your complete attention. In conversations, practice being fully present—put away distractions, make eye contact, and listen not just to respond, but to truly understand. This level of attention is rare and precious in our distracted world.

## Building Inner Contentment: The Foundation of Sharing Positivity 🌱

Before we can genuinely share warmth with others, we need to cultivate it within ourselves. This isn't about achieving some perfect state of happiness—it's about developing practical skills for managing our own emotional landscape.

### Self-Compassion in Action 🤗
Treat yourself with the same kindness you'd offer a good friend facing challenges. When you make mistakes, instead of harsh self-criticism, try asking: ""What would I tell someone I care about in this situation?"" This shift in internal dialogue creates the emotional foundation necessary for extending genuine warmth to others.

### Gratitude as Daily Practice 📝
Keep a simple gratitude practice—not because it's trendy, but because it rewires your brain to notice positive aspects of your life that might otherwise go unrecognized. Write down three specific things you appreciated each day. These don't need to be major events; often the smallest moments carry the most meaning.

### Physical Wellness as Emotional Foundation 💪
Your ability to maintain emotional equilibrium and extend positivity to others is directly connected to how you treat your physical body. Regular movement, adequate sleep, and nourishing food aren't luxuries—they're the foundation that supports your capacity for patience, empathy, and genuine care for others.

## Creating Ripple Effects in Your Community 🌊

### Workplace Positivity 🏢
Transform your work environment by becoming someone who actively looks for solutions rather than just identifying problems. When challenges arise, practice asking ""How might we approach this differently?"" instead of focusing solely on what's wrong. This shift in perspective is contagious and can gradually influence entire team dynamics.

### Neighborhood Connections 🏠
In our increasingly isolated world, small acts of community connection have outsized impact. This might mean learning the names of your neighbors, offering to help with grocery carrying, or simply making eye contact and smiling when you pass people on the street. These micro-interactions rebuild the social fabric that supports everyone's wellbeing.

### Teaching Through Example 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
Whether you have children or simply interact with young people, remember that your approach to handling stress, conflict, and daily challenges serves as a teaching moment. Demonstrating how to respond to difficulties with patience and problem-solving rather than reactive frustration shows others a different way of moving through the world.

## The Long-Term Impact of Consistent Positivity 📈

### Personal Transformation Over Time ⏰
People who consistently practice extending goodwill to others report profound changes in their own life satisfaction. This isn't because their external circumstances necessarily improve dramatically, but because their relationship with those circumstances transforms. Challenges become opportunities for growth rather than sources of victimization.

### Relationship Evolution 💞
As you become someone who actively contributes positive energy to interactions, you'll notice that your relationships naturally deepen. People feel safer being authentic around those who consistently offer warmth and acceptance. This creates a upward spiral where deeper connections lead to more meaningful exchanges of support.

### Community Influence 🌍
Individual practices of positivity aggregate into community change. When enough people in any group—whether it's a family, workplace, or neighborhood—commit to approaching interactions with genuine care and goodwill, the entire culture of that group shifts. Problems get solved more creatively, conflicts resolve more quickly, and everyone experiences greater satisfaction with their daily lives.

## Overcoming Skepticism and Cynicism 🛡️

It's natural to feel skeptical about practices that might seem overly optimistic, especially if you've experienced significant disappointments or trauma. The approach we're discussing here isn't about pretending that serious problems don't exist or that positive thinking alone solves everything.

Instead, it's about recognizing that regardless of external circumstances, you always have some degree of choice about how you respond to situations and treat other people. Even in difficult times, small acts of care and connection can provide stability and meaning.

### Practical Realism 🎯
Focus on what's actually within your influence. You can't control whether other people receive your positive intentions in the way you intend, but you can control whether you offer them. You can't guarantee that your kindness will be returned, but you can choose to offer it anyway because doing so aligns with the kind of person you want to be.

### Boundaries and Self-Protection 🛡️
Extending warmth and positivity to others doesn't mean becoming a doormat or ignoring red flags in relationships. Healthy boundary-setting is actually an expression of care—for yourself and for others. It models how to maintain personal integrity while still approaching life with openness and goodwill.

## Daily Practices That Actually Work 🔧

### The Two-Minute Morning Check-In ⏰
Before checking your phone or diving into daily tasks, spend two minutes asking yourself: ""How do I want to show up in the world today?"" This isn't about creating pressure to be perfect, but about conscious intention-setting that influences your interactions throughout the day.

### Evening Reflection Without Judgment 🌙
End each day by briefly reviewing moments when you offered or received kindness. Notice these instances without trying to score yourself or create elaborate improvement plans. Simple awareness of positive interactions helps your brain recognize and replicate them.

### The Curiosity Practice 🤔
When encountering people who seem difficult or unpleasant, try practicing curiosity instead of immediate judgment. Ask yourself: ""I wonder what's happening in this person's life that's contributing to their behavior?"" This doesn't excuse poor treatment, but it helps maintain your own emotional equilibrium and sometimes opens possibilities for more constructive interaction.

## Building Resilience Through Connection 💪

### Support Networks That Actually Support 🤝
Cultivate relationships with people who share your commitment to approaching life with intentional positivity. This doesn't mean surrounding yourself only with people who agree with everything you say, but rather connecting with those who share values around growth, kindness, and constructive problem-solving.

### Handling Setbacks Without Losing Heart 💔
When your efforts to spread positivity seem to go unnoticed or unappreciated, remember that the primary beneficiary of your practice is you. The person who consistently chooses to respond to life with openness and care develops internal resources that support them through inevitable challenges.

### Learning From Different Perspectives 🌈
Actively seek out viewpoints different from your own, not to argue or convert, but to expand your understanding of human experience. This practice builds empathy and prevents the kind of narrow thinking that leads to judgment and disconnection.

The simple act of wishing others well—whether you call it sending positive energy, good vibes, or just hoping for their happiness—represents something profound about human nature. It's our recognition that we're all connected, all struggling with challenges, and all deserving of compassion and support.

In a world that often feels divided and harsh, choosing to be someone who actively contributes warmth and encouragement becomes a radical act. It's not naive optimism; it's a practical strategy for creating the kind of world we want to live in, one interaction at a time.

As you move forward in your daily life, remember that every moment offers an opportunity to choose connection over isolation, understanding over judgment, and hope over despair. These choices might seem small, but they accumulate into a life of meaning and impact that extends far beyond what you might imagine.

May your days be filled with moments of genuine connection, your challenges met with resilience and creativity, and your interactions marked by the kind of warmth that makes the world a little brighter for everyone you encounter. 🌟

I hate sweets, like any kind. I even hate the sweet smells, and yes that includes coffee and vanilla perfumes. 

But in all of the books I've read till now, the FMC *loves* sweets, be it of any type, chocolate, ice cream, cake etc etc. I don't think I've ever even heard about about one who actually hates them. And most of the times, her smell is described as vanilla, strawberry or something sweet. And for the love of god I cannot relate to it.

So, Idk, maybe it's weird but imma ask anyways. What I want from the FMC,

1. She must hate sweets and yeah, for the whole book. It shouldn't be like she was introduced to new kinds by MMC and now she suddenly wants to try or likes it
2. Shouldn't be drowning in debt
3. Shouldn't be a whinny brat 

What I want from the MMC,

1. MMC has *something* to do with sweets, maybe he loves them has work that's related to sweets or literally anything
2. Isn't alphahole, over-possessive, over-controlling, emotionally stunted

What I don't want,

1. Bully/Historical/Alien Romance
2. Weak or Doormat FMC
3. BDSM
4. Age-gap more than 10 years

I thought it was my breakthrough, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.

Now though, I'm really struggling. I talked to her and hung out with hee pretty much all the time, she was my closest friend and I would always hang out with her friends as well for coffee/lunch during the week when we were all at work. Now I'm completely lonely and feel a bit abandoned cause I don't have my own solid friend group here or someone I can trust in anymore, I have friends in other places around the world but they are in different time zones and its hard for me to lean on them when I need because of that.

Work has been very stressful lately too (we all worked at different places but would have lunch meet ups during the week). I'm just drowning in everything right now, I've even noticed more white hairs appearing in my beard cause of the stress and grief of everything. And now I'm stressing over that, and everything is just compounding. I've been fine listening to music in my room then I just start crying out of nowhere. I'm renting in an apartment and have found out so hard to have the courage to get out of bed on some days.

  Statistics show that most mortals sell their souls for five reasons: sex, money, power, revenge, and love. In that order.  
  
  I suppose I should have been reassured, then, that I was out here assisting with numero uno, but the whole situation just made me feel. . . well, sleazy. And coming from me, that was something.  
  
  Maybe I just can't empathize anymore, I mused. It's been too long. When I was a virgin, people still believed swans could impregnate girls.  
  
  Nearby, Hugh waited patiently for me to overcome my reticence. He stuffed his hands into well-pressed khakis, leaning his large frame against his Lexus. ""I don't see what the big deal is. You do this all the time. ""  
  
  That wasn't exactly true, but we both knew what he meant. Ignoring him, I instead made a great show of studying my surroundings, not that that improved my mood. The suburbs always dragged me down. Identical houses. Perfect lawns. Far too many SUVs. Somewhere in the night, a dog refused to stop yapping.  
  
  ""I don't do this, "" I said finally. ""Even I have standards. ""  
  
  Hugh snorted, expressing his opinion of my standards.  
  
  ""Okay, if it makes you feel better, don't think of this in terms of damnation. Think of it as a charity case. ""  
  
  ""A charity case?""  
  
  ""Sure. ""  
  
  He pulled out his Pocket PC, looking briskly businesslike, despite the unorthodox setting. Not that I should have been surprised. Hugh was a professional imp, a master at getting mortals to sell their souls, an expert in contracts and legal loopholes that would have made any lawyer wince in envy.  
  
  He was also my friend. It sort of gave new meaning to the With friends like these. . . adage.  
  
  ""Listen to these stats,"" he continued. ""Martin Miller. Male, of course. Caucasian. Nonpracticing Lutheran. Works over at a game store in the mall. Lives in the basement here - his parents' house. ""  
  
  ""Jesus. ""  
  
  ""Told you. ""  
  
  ""Charity or no, it still seems so. . . extreme. How old is he again?""  
  
  ""Thirty-four. ""  
  
  "" Ew. ""  
  
  ""Exactly. If you were that old and hadn't gotten any, you might seek desperate measures too. "" He glanced down at his watch. ""So are you going to do this or not?""  
  
  No doubt I was keeping Hugh from a date with some hot woman half his age - by which I meant, of course, the age Hugh looked. In reality, he was pushing a century.  
  
  I set my purse on the ground and gave him a warning glance. ""You owe me. ""  
  
  ""I do,"" he conceded. This wasn't my usual gig, thank goodness. The imp normally ""outsourced"" this kind of thing but had run into some kind of scheduling problem tonight. I couldn't imagine who he normally got to do this.  
  
  I started toward the house, but he stopped me. ""Georgina?""  
  
  ""Yeah?""  
  
  ""There's. . . one other thing. . . ""  
  
  I turned back around, not liking the tone in his voice. ""Yes?""  
  
  ""He, um, sort of had a special request. ""  
  
  I raised an eyebrow and waited.  
  
  ""You see, uh, he's really into the whole, like, evil thing. You know, figures if he sold his soul to the devil - so to speak - then he should lose his virginity to a, I don't know, demoness or something. ""  
  
  I swear, even the dog stopped barking at that. ""You're joking. ""  
  
  Hugh didn't respond.  
  
  ""I'm not a - no. No way am I going to - ""  
  
  ""Come on, Georgina. It's nothing. A flourish. Smoke and mirrors. Please? Just do this for me?"" He turned wistful, cajoling. Hard to resist. Like I said, he was good at his job. ""I'm really in a tight spot. . . if you could help me out here. . . it would mean so much. . . ""  
  
  I groaned, unable to refuse the pathetic look on his broad face. ""If anyone finds out about this - ""  
  
  ""My lips are sealed. "" He actually had the audacity to make a sealing motion.  
  
  Bending down, resigned, I unfastened the straps on my shoes.  
  
  ""What are you doing?"" he asked.  
  
  ""These are my favorite Bruno Maglis. I don't want them absorbed when I change. ""  
  
  ""Yeah, but. . . you can just shape-shift them back. ""  
  
  ""They won't be the same. ""  
  
  ""They will. You can make them anything you want. This is just silly. ""  
  
  ""Look,"" I demanded, ""do you want to stand out here arguing shoes, or do you want me to go make a man of your virgin?""  
  
  Hugh clamped his mouth shut and gestured toward the house.  
  
  I padded away in the grass, the blades tickling my bare feet. The back patio leading to the basement was open, just as Hugh had promised. I let myself into the sleeping house, hoping they didn't have a dog, blearily wondering how I'd reached this low point in my existence. Adjusting to the darkness, my eyes soon discerned the features of a comfortable, middle-class family room: sofa, television, bookshelves. A stairwell rose to the left, and a hallway veered to the right.  
  
  I turned down the hall, letting my appearance shape-shift as I walked. The sensation was so familiar, so second nature to me, that I didn't even need to see my exterior to know what was happening. My petite frame grew taller, the slim build still staying slim but taking on a leaner, harder edge. My skin paled to death white, leaving no memory of its faint tan. The hair, already to my midback, stayed the same length but darkened to jet black, the fine waviness turning straight and coarse. My breasts - impressive by most standards - became larger still, rivaling those of the comic book heroines this guy had undoubtedly grown up with.  
  
  As for my outfit. . . well, away went the cute Banana Republic slacks and blouse. Thigh-high black leather boots appeared on my legs, paired with a matching halter top and a skirt I never could have bent over in. Spiky wings, horns, and a whip completed the package.  
  
  ""Oh Lord,"" I muttered, accidentally taking in the whole effect in a small decorative mirror. I hoped none of the local demonesses ever found about this. They were really quite classy.  
  
  Turning from the taunting mirror, I stared down the hall at my destination: a closed door with a yellow MEN AT WORK sign attached to it. I thought I could hear the faint sounds of a video game bleeping from beyond, though such noises silenced immediately when I knocked.  
  
  A moment later, the door opened, and I stood facing a five-foot-eight guy with shoulder-length, dirty blond hair rapidly receding on top. A large, hairy belly peeped out from underneath his Homer Simpson T-shirt, and he held a bag of potato chips in one hand.  
  
  The bag dropped to the floor when he saw me.  
  
  ""Martin Miller?""  
  
  ""Y-yes,"" he gasped out.  
  
  I cracked the whip. ""You ready to play with me?""  
  
  Exactly six minutes later, I left the Miller residence. Apparently thirty-four years doesn't do much for one's stamina.  
  
  ""Whoa, that was fast,"" Hugh noted, seeing me walk across the front yard. He was leaning against the car again, smoking a cigarette.  
  
  ""No shit. Got another one of those?""  
  
  He grinned and handed over his own cigarette, giving me a once-over. ""Would you be offended if I said the wings kind of get me hot?""  
  
  I took the cigarette, narrowing my eyes at him as I inhaled. A quick check ascertained no one else was around, and I shape-shifted back to my usual form.  
  
  ""You owe me big,"" I reminded him, putting the shoes back on.  
  
  ""I know. Of course, some might argue you owe me. You got a nice fix from it. Better than you're used to. ""  
  
  I couldn't deny that, but I didn't have to feel good about it either. Poor Martin. Geek or no, committing his soul to eternal damnation was a helluva price to pay for six minutes.  
  
  ""You wanna get a drink?"" Hugh offered.  
  
  ""No, it's too late. I'm going home. Got a book to read. ""  
  
  ""Ah, of course. When's the big day?""  
  
   
""Tomorrow,"" I proclaimed.  
  
  The imp chuckled at my hero worship. ""He just writes mainstream fiction, you know. He's hardly Nietzsche or Thoreau. ""  
  
  ""Hey, one doesn't have to be surreal or transcendental to be a great writer. I should know; I've seen a few over the years. ""  
  
  Hugh grunted at my imperious air, giving me a mock bow. ""Far be it from me to argue with a lady about her age. ""  
  
  I gave him a quick kiss on the cheek, then walked two blocks to where I had parked. I was unlocking the car door when I felt it: the warm, tingling feeling indicative of another immortal nearby. Vampire, I registered, only a millisecond before he appeared beside me. Damn, they moved fast.  
  
  ""Georgina, my belle, my sweet succubus, my goddess of delight,"" he intoned, placing his hands over his heart dramatically.  
  
  Great. Just what I needed. Duane was quite possibly the most obnoxious immortal I'd ever met. He kept his blond hair shaved to a close buzz, and as usual, he demonstrated terrible taste in both fashion and deodorant.  
  
  ""Go away, Duane. I have nothing to say to you. ""  
  
  ""Oh come on,"" he crooned, his hand snaking out to hold the door as I tried to open it. ""Even you can't play coy this time. Look at you. You're positively glowing. Good hunting, eh?""  
  
  I scowled at the reference to Martin's life energy, knowing it must be wreathing me. Obstinately, I tried to pry my door open against Duane's hold. No luck.  
  
  ""He'll be out for days, from the looks of it,"" the vampire added, peering at me closely. ""Still, I imagine whoever he was enjoyed the ride - both on you and to hell. "" He gave me a lazy smile, just barely revealing his pointed teeth. ""He must have been someone pretty good for you to look as hot as you do now. What happened? I thought you only fucked the scum of the earth. The real assholes. ""  
  
  ""Change of policy. I didn't want to give you false hope. ""  
  
  He shook his head appreciatively. ""Oh Georgina, you never disappoint - you and your witticisms. But then, I've always found whores know how to make good use of their mouths, on or off the job. ""  
  
  ""Let go,"" I snapped, tugging harder at the door.  
  
  ""Why the hurry? I have a right to know what you and the imp were doing over here. The Eastside is my turf. ""  
  
  ""We don't have to abide by your 'turf rules, and you know it. ""  
  
  ""Still, common courtesy dictates when you're in the neighborhood - literally, in this case - you at least say hello. Besides, how come we never hang out? You owe me some quality time. You spend enough time with those other losers. ""  
  
  The losers he referred to were my friends and the only decent vampires I'd ever met. Most vampires - like Duane - were arrogant, devoid of social skills, and obsessed with territoriality. Not unlike a lot of mortal men I'd met.  
  
  ""If you don't let me go, you're going to learn a whole new definition of 'common courtesy. '""  
  
  Okay, it was a stupid, faux action-movie line, but it was the best I could come up with on the spot. I made my voice sound as menacing as possible, but it was pure bravado, and he knew it. Succubi were gifted with charisma and shape-shifting; vampires had super strength and speed. What this meant was that one of us mingled better at parties, and the other could break a man's wrist with a handshake.  
  
  ""Are you actually threatening me?"" He ran a playful hand along my cheek, making the hairs on my neck stand on end - in a bad way. I squirmed. ""That's adorable. And kind of arousing. I actually think I'd like to see you on the offensive. Maybe if you'd just behave like a good girl - ow !You little bitch!""  
  
  With both of his hands occupied, I had seized my window of opportunity. A quick burst of shape-shifting, and sharp, three-inch claws appeared on my right hand. I swiped them across his cheek. His superior reflexes didn't let me get very far with the gesture, but I did draw blood before he gripped my wrist and slammed it against the car.  
  
  ""What's the matter? Not offensive enough for you?"" I managed through my pain. More bad movie lines.  
  
  ""Cute, Georgina. Very cute. We'll see how cute you are by the time I - ""  
  
  Headlights glimmered in the night as a car turned the corner on the next block and headed toward us. In that split second, I could see the indecision on Duane's face. Our t§?e-§?t§?e would undoubtedly be noticed by the driver. While Duane could easily kill an intervening mortal - hell, it was what he did for a living - having the kill linked to his harassment of me would not look good to our superiors. Even an asshole like Duane would think twice before stirring up that kind of paperwork.  
  
  ""We aren't finished,"" he hissed, releasing my wrist.  
  
  ""Oh, I think we are. "" I could feel braver now that salvation was on the way. ""The next time you come near me's going to be the last. ""  
  
  ""I'm quaking in terror,"" he simpered. His eyes gleamed once in the darkness, and then he was gone, moving off into the night just as the car drove past. Thank God for whatever liaison or ice cream run had pulled that driver out tonight.  
  
  Not wasting any more time, I got into my car and drove off, anxious to be back in the city. I tried to ignore the shaking of my hands on the wheel, but the truth of the matter was, Duane terrified me. I had told him off plenty of times in the presence of my immortal friends, but taking him on alone on a dark street was an entirely different matter, especially since all my threats had been empty ones.  
  
  I actually abhorred violence in all its forms. I suppose this came from living through periods of history fraught with levels of cruelty and brutality no one in the modern world could even comprehend. People like to say we live in violent times now, but they have no idea. Sure, there had been a certain satisfaction centuries ago in seeing a rapist castrated swiftly and promptly for his crimes, without endless courtroom drama or an early release for ""good behavior. "" Unfortunately, those who deal in revenge and vigilantism rarely know where to draw the line, so I'd take the bureaucracy of the modern judicial system any day.  
  
  Thinking back to how I'd presumed the fortuitous driver was on an ice cream run, I decided a little dessert would do me some good too. Once I was safely back in Seattle, I stopped in a 24-hour grocery store, discovering some marketing mastermind had created tiramisu-flavored ice cream. Tiramisu and ice cream. The ingenuity of mortals never failed to amaze me.  
  
  As I was about to pay, I passed a display of flowers. They were cheap and a little tattered, but I watched as a young man came in and nervously scanned them over. At last he selected some autumn-colored mums and carried them off. My eyes followed him wistfully, half-jealous of whatever girl would be getting those.  
  
  As Duane had noted, I usually fed off losers, guys I didn't have to feel guilty about hurting or rendering unconscious for a few days. Those kind did not send flowers and usually avoided most romantic gestures altogether. As for the guys who did send flowers, well, I avoided them. For their own good. That was out of character for a succubus, but I was too jaded to care about propriety anymore.  
  
  Feeling sad and lonely, I picked up a bouquet of red carnations for myself and paid for it and the ice cream.  
  
  When I arrived home, my phone was ringing. Setting down my goods, I glanced at the Caller-ID. Caller unknown.  
  
  ""My lord and master,"" I answered. ""What a perfect ending to a perfect night. ""  
  
  ""Save your quips, Georgie. Why were you fucking with Duane?""  
  
  ""Jerome, I - what?""  
  
  ""He just called. Said you were unduly hassling him. ""  
  
  ""Hassling? Him?"" Outrage surged inside me. ""He started it! He came up to me and - ""  
  
  ""Did you hit him?""  
  
  ""I. . . ""  
  
  ""Did you?""  
  
  I sighed. Jerome was the archdemon of the greater Seattle hierarchy of evil, as well as my supervisor. It was his job to manage all of us, make sure we did our duties, and keep us in line. Like any lazy demon, however, he preferred we create as little work for him as possible. His annoyance was almost palpable through the phone line.  
  
  ""I did sort of hit him. Actually, it was more of a swipe. ""  
  
  ""I see. A swipe. And did you threaten  
him too?""  
  
  ""Well, yes, I guess, if you want to argue semantics, but Jerome, come on! He's a vampire. I can't touch him. You know that. ""  
  
  The archdemon hesitated, apparently considering the outcome of me going head-to-head with Duane. I must have lost in the hypothetical battle because I heard Jerome exhale a moment later.  
  
  ""Yes. I suppose. But don't provoke him anymore. I've got enough to work on right now without you children having catfights. ""  
  
  ""Since when do you work?"" Children indeed.  
  
  ""Good night, Georgie. Don't tangle with Duane again. ""  
  
  The phone disconnected. Demons weren't big on small talk.  
  
  I hung up, feeling highly offended. I couldn't believe Duane had tattled on me and then made me out to be the bad guy. Worse, Jerome seemed to have believed it. At least at first. That probably hurt me most of all because, my slacker-succubus habits aside, I'd always enjoyed a kind of indulgent, teacher's pet role with the archdemon.  
  
  Seeking consolation, I carried the ice cream off to my bedroom, shedding my clothes for a loose nightshirt. Aubrey, my cat, stood up from where she'd been sleeping at the foot of my bed and stretched. Solid white save for some black smudges on her forehead, she squinted green eyes at me in greeting.  
  
  ""I can't go to bed,"" I told her, stifling a yawn. ""I have to read first. ""  
  
  I curled up with the pint and my book, recalling again how I'd finally be meeting my favorite author at the signing tomorrow. Seth Mortensen's writing always spoke to me, awakening something inside I hadn't even known was asleep. His current book, The Glasgow Pact, couldn't ease the guilt I felt over what had happened with Martin, but it filled an aching emptiness in me nonetheless. I marveled that mortals, living so short a time, could create such wonderful things.  
  
  ""I never created anything when I was a mortal,"" I told Aubrey when I'd finished five pages.  
  
  She rubbed against me, purring sympathetically, and I had just enough presence of mind to put the ice cream away before collapsing back into bed and falling asleep.  
CHAPTER 2  
  
   
  
  The phone jolted me to consciousness the next morning. Dim, murky light filtered in through my sheer curtains, signifying some freakishly early hour. Around here, however, that amount of light could have indicated anything from sunrise to high noon. After four rings, I finally deigned to answer, accidentally knocking Aubrey out of the bed. She landed with an indignant mhew and stalked off to clean herself.  
  
  ""Hello?""  
  
  "" Yo, Kincaid?""  
  
  ""No. "" My response came swift and certain. ""I'm not coming in. ""  
  
  ""You don't even know I'm going to ask that. ""  
  
  ""Of course I know. There's no other reason you'd be calling me this early, and I'm not going to do it. It's my day off, Doug. ""  
  
  Doug, the other assistant manager at my day job, was a pretty nice guy, but he couldn't keep a poker face - or voice - to save his life. His cool demeanor immediately gave way to desperation. ""Everyone called in sick today, and now we're strapped. You have to do it. ""  
  
  ""Well, I'm sick too. Believe me, you don't want me there. ""  
  
  Okay, I wasn't exactly sick, but I was still sporting a residual afterglow from being with Martin. Mortals would not ""see"" it as Duane had per se, but they would sense it and be drawn to it - men and women alike - without even knowing why. My confinement today would prevent any foolish, lovesick behavior. It was very kind of me, really.  
  
  ""Liar. You're never sick. ""  
  
  ""Doug, I was already planning on coming back tonight for the signing. If I work a shift today too, I'll be there all day. That's sick and twisted. ""  
  
  ""Welcome to my world, babe. We have no alternative, not if you really care about the fate of the store, not if you truly care about our customers and their happiness. . . ""  
  
  ""You're losing me, cowboy. ""  
  
  ""So,"" he continued, ""the question is, are you going to come here willingly, or do I have to walk over there and drag you out of bed myself? Frankly, I wouldn't mind the latter. ""  
  
  I did a mental eye roll, chiding myself for the billionth time about living two blocks from work. His rambling about the bookstore's suffering had been effective, as he'd known it would. I operated under the mistaken belief that the place couldn't survive without me.  
  
  ""Well, rather than risk any more of your attempts at witty, sexual banter, I suppose I'll have to come over there. But Doug. . . "" My voice turned hard.  
  
  ""Yeah?""  
  
  ""Don't put me on the registers or anything. ""  
  
  I heard hesitation on his end.  
  
  ""Doug? I'm serious. Not the main registers. I don't want to be around a lot of customers. ""  
  
  ""All right,"" he said at last. ""Not the main registers. ""  
  
  ""Promise?""  
  
  ""I promise. ""  
  
  A half hour later, I stepped outside my door to walk the two blocks to the bookstore. Long clouds hung low, darkening the sky, and a faint chill touched the air, forcing some of my fellow pedestrians to don a coat. I had opted for none, finding my khaki slacks and brown chenille sweater more than sufficient. The clothing, just like the lip gloss and eyeliner I'd carefully applied this morning, were real; I had not shape-shifted into them. I enjoyed the routine nature of applying cosmetics and matching articles of clothing, though Hugh would have claimed I was just being weird again.  
  
  Emerald City Books & Caf¨  
  
  was a sprawling establishment, occupying almost a full block in Seattle's Queen Anne neighborhood. It sat two stories high, with the cafe portion dominating a second-floor corner viewing the Space Needle. A cheerful green awning hung over the main door, protecting those customers waiting for the store to open. I walked around them and entered through a side door, using my staff key.  
  
  Doug assaulted me before I'd taken two steps inside. ""It's about time. We. . . "" He paused and did a double-take, reexamining me. ""Wow. You look. . . really nice today. Did you do something different?""  
  
  Only a thirty-four-year-old virgin, I thought.  
  
  ""You're just imagining things because you're so happy I'm here to fix your staffing problem. What am I doing? Stock?""  
  
  ""I, er, no. "" Doug struggled to snap out of his haze, still looking me up and down in a way I found disconcerting. His interest in dating me was no secret, nor was my continual rejection. ""Come on, I'll show you. ""  
  
  ""I told you - ""  
  
  ""It's not the main registers,"" he promised me.  
  
  What ""it"" turned out to be was the espresso counter in our upstairs cafe. Bookstore staff hardly ever subbed up here, but it wasn't unheard of.  
  
  Bruce, the cafe manager, popped up from where he'd been kneeling behind the counter. I often thought Doug and Bruce could be twins in a mixed-race, alternate-reality sort of way. Both had long, scraggly ponytails, and both wore a good deal of flannel in tribute to the grunge era neither had fully recovered from. They differed mainly in their coloring. Doug was Japanese-American, black-haired with flawless skin; Bruce was Mr. Aryan Nation, all blond hair and blue eyes.  
  
  ""Hey Doug, Georgina,"" heralded Bruce. His eyes widened at me. ""Whoa, you look great today. ""  
  
  ""Doug! This is just as bad. I told you I didn't want any customers. ""  
  
  ""You told me not the main registers. You didn't say anything about this one. ""  
  
  I opened my mouth to protest, but Bruce interrupted. ""Come on, Georgina, I had Alex call in sick today, and Cindy actually quit. "" Seeing my stony expression, he quickly added, ""Our registers are almost identical to yours. It'll be easy. ""  
  
  ""Besides"" - Doug raised his voice to a fair imitation of our manager's - "" 'assistant managers are supposed to be able to fill in for anybody around here. ' ""  
  
  ""Yeah, but the cafe - ""  
  
  "" - is still part of the store. Look, I've got to go open. Bruce'll show you what you need to know. Don't worry, it'll be fine. "" He hastily darted off before I could refuse again.  
  
  ""Coward!"" I yelled after him.  
  
  ""It really won't be that bad,"" Bruce reiterated, not understanding my dismay. ""You just take the money, and I'll make the espresso. Let's practice on you. You want a white chocolate mocha?""  
  
  ""Yeah,"" I conceded. Everyone I worked with knew about that particular vice. I usually managed to take down three of them a day. Mochas that was, not coworkers.  
  
  Bruce walked me through the necessary steps, showing me how to mark up the cups and find what I needed to push on the register's touch-screen interface. He was right. It wasn't so bad.  
  
  ""You're a natural,"" he assured me later, handing over my mocha.  
  
  I grunted in response and consumed my caffeine, thinking I could handle anything so long as the mochas kept coming.  
  
  Besides, this really couldn't be as bad as the main registers. The cafe probably did no business this time of day.  
  
  I was wrong. Minutes after opening, we had a line of five people.  
  
  ""Large latte,"" I repeated back to my first customer, carefully punching in the information.  
  
  ""Already got it,"" Bruce told me, starting the beverage before I even had a chance to label the cup. I happily took the woman's money and moved on to my next order.  
  
  ""A large skinny mocha. ""  
  
  "" Skinny's just another word for nonfat, Georgina. ""  
  
  I scrawled NF on the cup. No worries. We could do this.  
  
  The next customer wandered up and stared at me, momentarily bedazzled. Coming to her senses, she shook her head and blurted out a torrent of orders.  
  
  ""I need one small drip coffee, one large nonfat vanilla latte, one small double cappuccino, and one large decaf latte. ""  
  
  Now I felt bedazzled. How had she remembered all those? And honestly, who ordered drip anymore?  
  
  On and on the morning went, and despite my misgivings, I soon felt myself perking up and enjoying the experience. I couldn't help it. It was how I worked, how I carried myself through life. I liked trying new things - even something as banal as ringing up espresso. People could be silly, certainly, but I enjoyed working with the public most of the time. It was how I had ended up in customer service.  
<  
br />   And once I overcame my sleepiness, my inborn succubus charisma kicked in. I became the star of my own personal stage show, bantering and flirting with ease. When combined with the Martin-induced glamour, I became downright irresistible. While this did result in a number of proffered dates and pickup lines, it also saved me from the repercussions of any mistakes. My customers found no wrong with me.  
  
  ""That's all right, dear,"" one older woman assured me upon discovering I'd accidentally ordered her a large cinnamon mocha instead of a nonfat, decaf latte. ""I really need to branch out into new drinks anyway. ""  
  
  I smiled back winningly, hoping she wasn't diabetic.  
  
  Later on, a guy came up carrying a copy of Seth Mortensen's The Glasgow Pact. It was the first sign I'd seen of tonight's momentous event.  
  
  ""Are you going to the signing?"" I asked as I rang up his tea. Bleh. Caffeine-free.  
  
  He studied me for a pregnant moment, and I braced myself for a pass.  
  
  Instead the guy said mildly, ""Yeah, I'll be there. ""  
  
  ""Well, make sure you think up good questions for him. Don't ask the same ones everyone else does. ""  
  
  ""What do you mean?""  
  
  ""Oh, you know, the usual. 'Where do you get your ideas from?' and 'Are Cady and O'Neill ever going to get together?' ""  
  
  The guy considered this as I made change. He was cute, in a disheveled sort of way. He had brown hair with a reddish-gold gleam to it, said gleam being more noticeable in the shadow of facial hair crossing his lower face. I couldn't quite decide if he'd intentionally grown a beard or just forgotten to shave. Whatever it was, it had grown in more or less evenly and, when combined with the Pink Floyd T-shirt he wore, presented the image of a sort of hippie-lumberjack.  
  
  ""I don't think the 'usual questions' make them any less meaningful to the one doing the asking,"" he decided at last, seeming shy about contradicting me. ""To a fan, each question is new and unique. ""  
  
  He stepped aside so I could wait on another customer. I continued the conversation as I took the next order, unwilling to pass up the opportunity to discuss Seth Mortensen intelligently.  
  
  ""Forget the fans. What about poor Seth Mortensen? He probably wants to impale himself each time he gets one of those. ""  
  
  "" 'Impale' is kind of a strong word, don't you think?""  
  
  ""Absolutely not. The guy's brilliant. Hearing idiotic questions must bore him to tears. ""  
  
  A bemused smile played across the man's mouth, and his steady brown eyes weighed me carefully. When he realized he was staring so openly, he glanced away, embarrassed. ""No. If he's out touring, he cares about his fans. He doesn't mind the repetitive questions. ""  
  
  ""He's not out touring for altruism. He's out touring because the publicists at his publishing house are making him tour,"" I countered. ""Which is also a waste of time, by the way. ""  
  
  He dared a look back at me. ""Touring is? You don't want to meet him?""  
  
  ""I - well, yes, of course I do. It's just, that. . . okay. Look, don't get me wrong. I worship the ground this guy walks on. I'm excited to meet him tonight. I'm dying to meet him tonight. If he wanted to carry me off and make me his love slave, I'd do it, so long as I got advance copies of his books. But this touring thing. . . it takes time. Time that would be better spent writing the next book. I mean, haven't you seen how long his books take to come out?""  
  
  ""Yeah. I've noticed. ""  
  
  Just then, a previous customer returned, complaining he'd gotten caramel syrup instead of caramel sauce. Whatever that meant. I offered a few smiles and sweet apologies, and he soon didn't care about the caramel sauce or anything else. By the time he left my register, the Mortensen fan guy was gone too.  
  
  When I finally finished my shift around five, Doug came to meet me.  
  
  ""I heard some interesting things about your performance up here. ""  
  
  ""I hear interesting things about your 'performance' all the time, Doug, but you don't hear me making jokes about it. ""  
  
  He bandied with me a bit more and finally released me to get ready for the signing, but not before I'd made him humbly acknowledge how much he owed me for my kindness today. Between him and Hugh, I was accruing favors all over the place.  
  
  I practically ran the two blocks home, anxious to grab some dinner and figure out what I wanted to wear. My exhilaration was growing. In an hour or so, I'd be meeting my all-time favorite author. Could life get any better? Humming to myself, I took the stairs two at a time and produced my keys with a flourish that only I noticed or appreciated.  
  
  As I opened the door, a hand suddenly grabbed me and pulled me roughly inside, into the darkness of my apartment. I yelped in surprise and fear as I was shoved up against the door, slamming it shut. The lights burst on suddenly and unexpectedly, and the faint smell of sulfur wafted through the air. Although the brightness made me wince, I could see well enough to recognize what was going on.  Hell hath no fury like a pissed-off demon.

*Discovering the person you've always been beneath the criticism*

---

## The Moment Everything Changes ✨

Picture this: you're standing in front of your bathroom mirror, and instead of immediately cataloging your flaws, you pause. Something shifts. For the first time in maybe years, you don't cringe at your reflection. Instead, you see a human being who's been doing their best with the tools they had.

This isn't fantasy—it's what happens when you finally stop being your own worst enemy. The ripple effects? They're extraordinary.

When you cease the internal warfare against yourself, something magical occurs. That critical voice that once dissected every imperfection begins to quiet. The same eyes that once searched for reasons to feel inadequate start noticing strength, resilience, and yes—beauty.

But here's where it gets really interesting: this shift in how you see yourself completely rewires how you experience everything else.

---

## The Inner-Outer Connection 🔄

Think about the last time you were having a particularly rough day with yourself. Maybe you felt bloated, tired, or just ""off."" How did you treat the cashier at the grocery store? Your family members? Even strangers on the street?

Now recall a day when you felt genuinely good about yourself—confident, energized, at peace. Notice the difference in how you moved through the world?

This isn't coincidence. Our internal relationship sets the tone for every external interaction. When we're harsh with ourselves, we unconsciously project that harshness outward. When we're kind to ourselves, that kindness naturally extends to others.

The transformation isn't just personal—it's planetary.

---

## The Daily Damage We Don't See 💔

Let's get honest about something most people don't want to discuss: the ways we sabotage ourselves daily, then create elaborate stories to make it okay.

**The Food Stories** 🍪
""It's just one slice of pizza... I've been good all week... I deserve this... I'll start fresh Monday...""

**The Movement Excuses** 🛋️
""I'm too tired today... I don't have time... It's too cold/hot/rainy... I'll do double tomorrow...""

**The Mental Consumption** 📱
""Just five more minutes scrolling... This show isn't that bad for me... Everyone else is watching the news constantly...""

**The Procrastination Narratives** ⏰
""I work better under pressure... It's not that important... I'll have more energy later...""

Here's the uncomfortable truth: every time we make these choices and follow them with justifications, we're essentially telling ourselves we don't matter enough to keep our own promises. We're training our subconscious that we're unreliable, even to ourselves.

---

## The Real Cost of Self-Betrayal 📉

These seemingly small betrayals compound like interest. What starts as ""just one cookie"" becomes a pattern of emotional eating. ""Just five more minutes"" of scrolling becomes hours of lost productivity and comparison-induced anxiety.

The physical symptoms show up as:
• Unexplained fatigue
• Weight that won't budge despite efforts
• Skin problems
• Sleep disruption
• Digestive issues

The emotional symptoms manifest as:
• Persistent low-level anxiety
• Feelings of being stuck or trapped
• Irritability over small things
• Difficulty making decisions
• A sense that life is happening TO you rather than WITH you

But here's what's crucial to understand: this isn't about perfection. It's about honesty.

## The Four Pillars of Self-Respect 🏛️

Everything you consume—food, media, thoughts, relationships—either builds you up or tears you down. There's very little neutral territory.

**Pillar 1: Physical Nourishment** 🥗
Your body is literally rebuilt from what you eat every 7-10 years. Every cell, every organ, every system gets refreshed. The question is: what are you building yourself from?

This doesn't mean restrictive dieting or punishment. It means honoring your body enough to give it what it needs to thrive. When you eat food that makes you feel energized and strong, you're sending yourself a message: ""I matter. I deserve to feel good.""

**Pillar 2: Mental Nutrition** 🧠
Your thoughts are on repeat all day long. The average person has 60,000-80,000 thoughts daily, and about 95% of them are the same as yesterday's.

If those repeated thoughts are criticism, worry, and negativity, you're essentially marinating your brain in stress chemicals all day. But when you become intentional about what you think about—focusing on solutions, gratitude, and possibility—you literally rewire your neural pathways for happiness.

**Pillar 3: Emotional Environment** ❤️
The people you spend time with, the conversations you have, the entertainment you choose—all of it shapes your emotional baseline.

Notice how you feel after spending time with different people. Some leave you energized and inspired. Others drain you or make you feel worse about yourself. This isn't about being selfish; it's about being selective. You have limited emotional energy, and how you spend it matters.

**Pillar 4: Physical Movement** 💪
Your body was designed to move. When you don't use your muscles, they literally disappear (muscle atrophy). When you don't challenge your cardiovascular system, it weakens. When you don't stretch, you lose flexibility.

But here's the psychological piece most people miss: every time you move your body when you don't feel like it, you prove to yourself that you can do hard things. You build not just physical strength, but mental resilience.

---

## The Accountability Revolution 🔥

Real change begins when you stop making excuses for behavior that doesn't serve you. This isn't about self-punishment—it's about self-respect.

Accountability means:
• Calling yourself out on your own stories
• Following through on commitments you make to yourself
• Choosing discomfort now over regret later
• Recognizing that ""later"" often never comes

The most successful people aren't those who never mess up—they're those who get honest about their patterns quickly and course-correct without drama.

---

## Living in an Insane World Sanely 🌍

Let's acknowledge something: the world feels increasingly chaotic. Social media comparison, 24/7 news cycles, economic uncertainty, environmental concerns, political division—it's a lot.

But here's a counterintuitive truth: the more chaotic the external world becomes, the more important your internal stability becomes. You can't control global events, but you can absolutely control your daily choices.

When you take excellent care of yourself, you become:
• Less reactive to external circumstances
• More capable of helping others
• A stabilizing force in your family and community
• An example of what's possible

This isn't selfish—it's strategic. The world needs more people who are mentally clear, physically strong, and emotionally stable.

---

## The Non-Negotiables ✋

In a world that constantly asks you to compromise your well-being for convenience, productivity, or social acceptance, you need non-negotiables. These are the standards you maintain regardless of circumstances.

Some examples might be:
• I don't eat food that makes me feel terrible afterward
• I move my body every single day, even if it's just a 10-minute walk
• I don't consume media that makes me anxious or angry first thing in the morning
• I go to bed early enough to get adequate sleep
• I don't engage in conversations that are purely complaint-based
• I spend time in nature weekly
• I read or learn something new daily

Notice these aren't about perfection—they're about consistency in the things that matter most.

---

## The Ripple Effect 🌊

When you start treating yourself with genuine respect and care, everything shifts:

**Week 1-2:** You notice small physical changes—more energy, better sleep, improved mood.

**Week 3-4:** People start commenting that you seem different. You realize you're less irritable and more patient.

**Month 2-3:** You start naturally attracting different opportunities and relationships. Like energy attracts like energy.

**Month 6+:** You become someone you genuinely like and respect. The person in the mirror isn't just acceptable—they're someone you're proud to be.

## The 400-Year Test 🕰️

Imagine someone discovering your daily habits 400 years from now. Would they conclude you were someone who valued themselves? Someone who understood that self-care isn't selfish but essential?

The principles of taking care of your physical vessel, nourishing your mind with good information, surrounding yourself with positive influences, and keeping your word to yourself—these truths are timeless.

Technology will change, society will evolve, but the fundamental requirement to treat yourself well in order to show up fully in the world? That's eternal.

## Your Next Right Action 👣

Transformation doesn't happen in grand gestures—it happens in the accumulation of small, consistent choices that honor who you're becoming.

Right now, today, you can:
• Choose one thing to put in your body that will nourish rather than just fill you
• Move for 10 minutes with intention
• Turn off one source of mental negativity
• Keep one small promise to yourself
• Look in the mirror and acknowledge one thing you appreciate about yourself

The person you're capable of becoming is already inside you, waiting for you to stop fighting them and start supporting them instead.

Remember: nobody owes you the life you want. But you owe it to yourself to create it.

Your future self is counting on the choices you make today. Make them count. 💫

*Jyrinvaara, northen Karelia in Finland by the time (from 1944 in Russia), spring 1917.*

This abduction case was first mentioned in the newspaper Kurkijokelainen, which is mainly read by persons who formerly lived in the little community of Kurkijoki in finnish speaking Northern Karelia, nowadays a territory in Russia. This was a short article written by the signature ""Latomaen Aino"", in no. 23 (9 June 1978) of Kurkijokelainen:

The author tells a story from the time just before Finland declared independency from Russia, i.e. 1917. Anni, a middle aged widow, was living in her little house in Jyrinvaara, about 6 km (3.7 miles) to the west from the Kurkijoki church. She disappeared for some days, and the villagers thought she had gone to visit her daughter. But when she came back, she had an amazing story to tell.

[When Anni came home there was a large machine in front of her house and strange beings were walking on the ground nearby. \(artistic interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/qbafz76ayslf1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=949eba9d34adf35a80c0978446ca18a4e55b0c96)

A large machine, like a big metal wash-basin, had landed beside her house and from it and small beings, which Anni later called devils, came down by a ladder. Somehow she could understand a little of their language. She was not willing to follow them, but she was taken aboard by force, and they travelled very fast, everything in the world was shown to her and there was a lot of wonder. The machine’s metal was shining inside and it made no noise as in the train. Anni told that the devils flew her over the world and even between the stars. Anni retold her story many times for people in the community, but everybody said that she had a fever and hallucinated or was just dreaming, but Anni did not agree. The author of the article speculated if the machine was a UFO and the devils could have been humanoids; or did Anni only had a fever and dreamed it all?

[The beings as Anni percieved as Devils took her on a fantastic voyage and she saw many wonders. \(artistic interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/kueb1gblyslf1.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=818a09e9fabf2f28a244c02e90abd9b8fe85074b)

Further investgations: Because of this article, one of the investigators in the UFO Research of Finland, Mauritz Hietamaki, located and interviewed Mrs NN (born 1910), who was a little girl and one of Anni's neighbours when the event took place. During the years that followed Anni's experience, she had often told about it in NN's home, so Mrs NN could remember all the details. Anni's full name was Anni Lattu (1873 - 1930) and she was not a widow, even if it is probable that she lived alone. Actually, her husband Juho died 11 years later than herself. Mrs. NN recollected that Anni was always alone when visiting the other villagers, so it was quite natural that NN as a little girl took her for a widow. She lived in a little house on the eastern shore of the Kankaanlampi Lake, in the village of Alho. The event took place, according to Mrs NN, between January and Easter in 1917. Anni was doing her everyday work, when the machine; which she described as wash-basin-shaped (the usual wash-basin in those days was like a big soup plate). It had ladders, by which Anni was taken aboard against her will. Inside the craft, there were a lot of small men, who were moving around quickly. Anni never spoke of their clothes, and it sees that she did not have any ideas of what the small men were. As the religious people in the village thought they were Devils, Anni accepted this fact and later called them that whenever she retold her story.

[In those days eastern Finland was not yet part of Russia. \(picture: Nordic UFO Newsletter\)](https://preview.redd.it/6gzrod7yyslf1.jpg?width=805&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31f414837cb8b5bdd05ef6a750e91626cb113dc4)

Mrs NN comprehended from Anni's story that there had been a leader with which Anni communicated, perhaps by telepathy. Anni had been several days inside the craft; they had cruised around the world and near the stars. Anni was also asked to stay, but she did not want to. Inside the craft there had been conveniently warm and the seats were comfortable. Finally, Anni was brought back to the same place as she was taken from, i.e. from the road outside her house.

The other villagers thought that Anni had a fever (her house was very cold during the winter) and her experience was only fever dreams. Anni never accepted this, and it seems she spoke of it quite often, because she could not understand what had happened to her during those days.

**A roadside encounter in the country side.**

*Frösunda north of Stockholm, Sweden, late autumn 1963.*

A man who wished to remain anonymous (and also involved in other encounters), lived in a house in the countryside north of Stockholm from 1963 to 1967. This area was a place of much UFO activity throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, culminating in the world-famous UFO incidents of 1974 around Vallentuna municipality and the nearby community of Ormsta.

The man had been working the evening shift in Stockholm and was on his way home the 50 kilometers (31 miles) and had taken the road through Vallentuna town, to get to the community of Kårsta where he lived. He was now driving out in the countryside and the road took him past forests, open fields, barns and small quiet communities. It was late in the evening and it was cold outside and there was frost on the ground and on the vegetation around the road and the ice crystals glittered in the moonlight. He did not encounter much other traffic and only the car's headlights illuminated the road and the surroundings. The man was driving his 1953 Volvo PV and it was a good and reliable car that had rarely had any problems.

After passing the small rural community of Frösunda, the asphalt ended and the road turned into a gravel road. However, it was a very nice, wide and even gravel road and the man was still able to maintain a high speed. The man wanted to get home quickly and on a long straight stretch with open fields all around, the speed was almost up to 90 km/h (55 miles/h). That is when he suddenly saw a bright yellow-white light coming in from above a little to the side, and then hovering above the car like a helicopter. It was also the man's first thought that this was a Police helicopter and that he had been driving too fast and that they wanted to stop him. Now the road started to get more curvy again and he had to slow down and concentrate on the road. And it was at an intersection further ahead that he lost the object again. However, he had the feeling that the object was still close and that it was pursuing him.

[The witness was driving his car on a lonely road when a bright light appeared in front of him. \(artistic interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/ky9bgr6jzslf1.jpg?width=933&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7aa87e4bbc699f12ceb6c428ecf73cd41fe0a66b)

That is when the car started to malfunction. First the man felt a strange warmth in his neck and then the lights went out and the engine started to sputter. It coughed a few more times and then it stopped. The man was now on a downhill slope and rolled the Volvo and stopped it in a wide curve. He tried to start the car again several times, but it didn't work. It was dead. He realized that he might have to walk the last bit to his home. Luckily, it was not that far away, only three kilometers left (1.8 miles).

When he opened the car door, he noticed a strange light beyond some bushes and small trees not far from the car. He realized that it might be the craft he had seen above him just before. It was standing in a depression between some hills and the farmers also used this quite secluded patch of grass as a shooting range for their hunting rifles. The man was curious about what kind of fast and maneuverable craft this could be and went closer. And perhaps the pilots had to make an emergency landing and needed help or were injured?

He now saw that the craft was quite protected from view from the road and it was only the light from it that made him see it. He went out into the small field and walked closer. Then he saw that some kind of blue light was flashing in the middle of the metallic craft, which was oval and had three square windows. On the roof it also had three antennas with red lights on the tip. Under the craft there were strong white lights that lit up the ground below and he could also see the silhouettes of several men standing under the object. They were short and dressed in something like overalls and they seemed to be doing some work on the craft from below. The man could hear a flapping sound and a crackling sound from something like high-voltage wires or a welding machine. He estimated the size of the oval craft to be 3 – 4 meters high (10 – 13 feet) and 6 – 7 meters wide (20 – 23 feet) and it was standing on the grass with 4 landing legs. The man also felt that the air around him seemed sticky, as if from static electricity during a thunderstorm. He was absolutely certain that it was coming from the craft.

[An unknown craft had landed in the field, and below it men were doing repairs. The witness watched from a distance. \(artistic interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/w8j2vboqzslf1.jpg?width=1084&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea81c03ca93811addc28047962232b8fae128d91)

The man had now been spotted by the people under the craft who began to stare at him and talk among themselves. Then three of them started walking towards him. The one in the middle was taller than the two others on the sides and he was about 160 cm (5.3 feet) while the other two were 120 cm (3.9 feet). The two shorter people also had face covering helmets on their heads, which the tall one didn't seem to need, as he had no helmet at all. He looked like a normal person but was a little shorter. It also seemed as if he was some kind of commander of the group. They quickly approached the lone man who stood there as if paralyzed. He tried to run but couldn't. The tall one without a helmet now came closer to the man and stopped right next to him. ""Where can we find water?"" he asked. His lips didn't move so the question must have been asked by telepathy. The man replied that there was a small lake beyond the hill and that he could show them. Together they all went up the nearby hill and it went very fast, almost as if they were flying. The man now pointed out the pond that was visible. The tall one without a helmet thanked him telepathically.

On the way back down the hill, the man asked where the visitors came from and the tall one pointed up at the starry sky. Where he pointed was a place near the Big Dipper. But suddenly the tall one grabbed the man's arm and tried to pull him along. They almost flew towards the craft quite quickly, but at the last moment the man grabbed a tree and held on in panic. He was sure that the visitors wanted him aboard the craft. Maybe they wanted to show him where they came from? The man didn't want that. Then a truck made a noise out on the nearby road and the man started screaming for help, but then everything went black. Several hours later the man woke up from the cold. He looked around and saw that the craft and the short men were gone. When he heard a car coming on the road, he rushed out and stopped it. It turned out to be one of his neighbors who gave the man a ride to his house. Once home, he went straight to bed and fell asleep right away.

[Three \\""men\\"" approached the witness, who was pursuaded to follow them and show them were they could find water. \(artistic interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/zl863oozzslf1.jpg?width=1008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69f2c91a9ae41860c064c214769fc738568abd50)

The next day the man woke up feeling unwell and his eyes felt heavy and strained. He later called a friend and asked if he could help him with his car that had broken down. The friend arrived and they drove to the car. They tried to start the car with jump cables and other means but to no avail. The car would not start. Instead, the man and his friend went up the hill where he had been the night before with the space people and in the grass they now saw some kind of jelly-like slime. The friend wondered what this strange substance was and when he bent down to take a closer look he discovered the man's wristwatch in the grass nearby. The man tried to tell him what had happened the night before, but the friend did not believe him and laughed and claimed that he must have been drunk and vomited this jelly on the ground and then fell asleep in the grass for a few hours. Then they towed the man's Volvo home with the help of the friend's car. Later, the man discovered that the starter motor, alternator, and battery smelled burnt, and after he bought a new battery and replaced the old one, the car started again without any problems.

Some time later, the man visited the site again and discovered that the ground where the craft had stood was really flattened and the grass was black here and there as if it had been burned. The slime was also still there and had expanded in size. He also met an unknown person at the site, who also stopped and looked at the gel. He also wondered what it could be and also saw the scorched grass below the hill. The man then said to the other person: “Maybe a saucer has landed here?” The unknown person replied: “Yes, it is not completely impossible.” and then he quickly walked away. There was something strange about this person, the man thought, something that was not right. Did he know anything about the landing? The man never saw this person again... and he never saw the space people and their craft again either. But that was not the last time the man would encounter something unexplainable...

**New information emerged from a close encounter with a UFO.**

*Helsingør, eastern Denmark, April 1973.*

In the spring of 1973, a man in the Helsingør area had a close encounter with an oblong flying object with several illuminated windows. He contacted the Danish UFO organization SUFOI who came to his home and conducted an interview. The man was still shocked and was happy to talk to the investigators because his family did not believe him. There were several visits to the man and they got to know him quite well. They got a lot of information about the incident from the man during these interviews. But they still got the feeling that there was something that the man was holding back and was not telling. Several years later, the man's wife called one of the UFO investigators they had met before and she said that she had noticed in her husband that there was something he wanted to tell. SUFOI again visited the family and over a cup of coffee the following story emerged.

[An elongated glowing craft was seen above the marschland near the road. \(picture: UFO-Nyt\)](https://preview.redd.it/kpzwfz7b0tlf1.jpg?width=909&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd72965c34ab2bbd060ddc1b3628ed509a1c55ee)

It was 9:07 PM and the man was out walking in the area where he lived that evening. Then he suddenly saw out of the corner of his eye a bright object in the sky to the southwest and it was rapidly coming closer and closer to him. It was a red-hot flaming object and the man could hear a crackling/sizzling sound from the flames similar to that of slowly pouring water on red-hot iron. For a short while it almost seemed as if the object was going to hit him and the man was about to start running away, but then 50 meters (165 feet) away from him the object stopped and then made a sharp turn to the right and then stopped again 30 – 40 meters (98 – 131 feet) further away over a depression in the terrain where there was swampland. So far the story was relatively identical to what the investigators had heard before.

But during this meeting the man was more inclined to talk about certain details that he had previously kept to himself. Now he told the investigators that in the bow of the craft there was a round bulging window and inside this he had seen three beings (!) and behind them a white-orange light was blazing and some luminous rods that moved slightly. The people in the window were wearing black suits and he could only see them from the waist up. The man described their appearance as hideous. *""They looked cruel. Their arms could not be seen, their necks were thin and their heads were somewhat angular. Their eyes were like large, shiny glasses, and where their ears should have been, there were long, upright growths.""* The witness said that these growths could be some kind of antennae. He did not see any detailed facial features.

[Three being as the witness described as \\""grim\\"" and \\""hideous\\"" was standing in a big round window of the craft. \(artistic interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/otij0amh0tlf1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=212e331531086e7a7faaacc1f61893df9713ca30)

After the man told the investigators about the people in the craft, they could notice that it was as if a weight lifted from his heart and he felt relieved. The witness said that he had not wanted to mention anything about these beings before, because he was afraid that the investigators would then dismiss the whole incident as pure fantasy. The man did not initially want this latest episode to be added to the previous testimony, because he had heard that leading people within SUFOI viewed UFO cases involving alien beings with skepticism and contempt. With the man's permission, the case was later updated.

**UFO-landing in Hessdalen.**

*Hessdalen, mid-Norway, May – June 1984.*

Hessdalen in Norway is known to be a place where many unexplained UFO phenomena have been observed over the years. The mysterious so-called “Hessdalen lights” have been seen, photographed and filmed by many people in the valley area since the 1930s. The phenomenon reached its peak between 1981 – 1984 when the lights were reported up to 15 – 20 times / week.

In 1983, UFO-Norway and UFO-Sweden started “Project Hessdalen” with the aim of investigating the strange lights in more detail, and in 2010 they set up HAMS (Hessdalen Automatic Measurement Station) to record, measure and film the phenomena. Many theories about the Hessdalen Lights have been put forward, but no one has yet answered the question of what causes these phenomena, where they come from, or who/what is behind it.

[A light orb was travelling above the landscape... \(picture: UFO Aktuellt\)](https://preview.redd.it/72vg709t0tlf1.jpg?width=884&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0be57a3205c56862bbd46b781dff1f03647cc08b)

UFO landings have also been reported in the area and in the early summer of 1984, 60-year-old Mrs. Eli Bendås was involved in one. She lived in the community of Ålen, which was a couple of kilometers (1.2 miles) northeast of Hessdalen. That day, Eli had been up with her cows on the mountain pastures and came home late in the evening. She was tired after the day's work and went to bed. But for some reason she couldn't sleep and lay there for a long time just tossing and turning in bed. She thought it was pointless to just lie there, so instead she got up and the time was around 0:30 PM. She went to one of the windows in the houses that faced Rognefjell (Rogne mountain) and looked out. As is usual in Scandinavia in the summer, it wasn't quite pitch black outside at night and the weather was clear and nice and the sky still had some faint color.

[...which then changed shape to elongated. After that it landed and a white being stepped out just briefly. \(artistic interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/ucgv55pz0tlf1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db00aa2bbfed9320acbef700af8363d840f1184c)

Suddenly Eli saw a red glowing ball traveling from south to north along Rogne mountain. The object passed in front of the mountain massif and it moved a little in a wave motion. Then the orb stopped and it went from red to white light and then it sank down and landed in a meadow 400 meters (437 yards) away from her. She also thought it looked as if the object changed shape to become oblong or cigar-shaped. When it was on the ground, a white figure jumped out. The sequence of events happened very quickly and it didn't take many seconds before the white being climbed into the object again. Then the UFO lifted up into the air and tilted over on one side and disappeared. How it disappeared and where Eli could not see.

Mrs. Bendås heard of many people who have made strange sightings in the Hessdalen area, and for her it was the second time she had seen a UFO there. About a year before, she had seen a similar red light orb flying in front of Rognefjell, but that time it did not land.

Specifically reflux agitating your vagus nerve.","The vagus nerve runs from your brainstem down through your chest and abdomen, touching almost every major organ. Because it’s involved in digestion, heart rhythm, and inflammation control, certain foods can irritate or overstimulate it indirectly, usually through effects on the gut, reflux, or inflammation. Here’s a rundown:

⸻

Foods that commonly aggravate the vagus nerve

1. Acidic & reflux-triggering foods

These can irritate the esophagus and stomach, which communicate heavily with the vagus nerve.
	•	Coffee (even decaf can trigger reflux)
	•	Citrus fruits (orange, lemon, grapefruit)
	•	Tomatoes and tomato sauces
	•	Vinegar-heavy foods

2. High-fat, fried, and greasy foods

These slow gastric emptying, which can overstimulate vagal signaling and trigger nausea or reflux.
	•	Deep fried foods
	•	Pizza, fast food burgers
	•	Cream-heavy dishes

3. Spicy foods

Can cause heartburn and gut irritation, signaling strongly through the vagus nerve.
	•	Hot peppers, chili, curry, wasabi

4. Gas-producing & fermentable foods (FODMAP triggers)

Overstretching the stomach or intestines can provoke vagus nerve discomfort.
	•	Beans, lentils
	•	Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower)
	•	Onions, garlic
	•	Carbonated drinks

5. Alcohol & stimulants
	•	Alcohol irritates the gut lining and affects vagal tone.
	•	Energy drinks and excess caffeine overstimulate autonomic balance.

⸻

Symptoms when the vagus nerve is irritated

Because the vagus nerve influences both digestion and autonomic nervous system balance, symptoms can be wide-ranging:
	•	Digestive: reflux, nausea, bloating, early fullness, slowed digestion, constipation or diarrhea
	•	Cardiovascular: palpitations, sudden drop in blood pressure, dizziness, fainting (vasovagal response)
	•	Neurological/autonomic: anxiety spikes, sweating, flushing, shaking
	•	Respiratory: shortness of breath or tight throat sensation (from reflux irritation or vagal reflexes)

Life has a funny way of putting us at crossroads where we must choose between comfort and growth. One of the most challenging situations many of us face is when our personal development journey starts affecting our closest relationships. This isn't about being selfish or abandoning people we care about – it's about understanding how human connections work and making informed decisions about our future.

## 🎯 Understanding Energy and Compatibility

Think of every person, situation, and relationship as having an invisible energy signature. Just like radio stations operate on different frequencies, people operate on different emotional and mental wavelengths. When two people share similar energy levels, they naturally connect and maintain strong bonds.

Here's what happens in practice: relationships built on mutual respect, shared goals, emotional maturity, and healthy communication tend to thrive and evolve together. However, relationships rooted in dependency, fear of abandonment, control, manipulation, or unresolved personal issues often struggle when one person begins to change.

## 🔄 The Growth Dilemma

Picture this scenario: You've been working on yourself – maybe you've started therapy, developed better boundaries, learned new skills, or simply gained more confidence. You're feeling more positive, setting healthier goals, and generally becoming a better version of yourself.

But suddenly, you notice tension in your relationship. Your partner seems resistant to these changes, maybe even trying to pull you back to old patterns. They might criticize your new interests, dismiss your progress, or create conflicts that drain your energy.

This creates what psychologists call cognitive dissonance – the uncomfortable feeling when your growth mindset clashes with the stagnant dynamics of your relationship.

## 💡 Why This Happens: The Comfort Zone Effect

People naturally resist change, even positive change, because it threatens their sense of security and predictability. When you start growing, you're essentially changing the rules of your relationship dynamic. Your partner might feel:

✨ Left behind or inadequate  
✨ Uncertain about their place in your life  
✨ Threatened by your independence  
✨ Confused by the shifting relationship balance  

This isn't necessarily malicious – it's human nature to want things to stay familiar and predictable.

## 🎭 The Pressure to Stay Small

Here's where it gets tricky. You might find yourself torn between two choices:

**Option 1: Shrink Back to Fit**  
You could dial down your growth, avoid new opportunities, or suppress your evolving interests to keep the peace. Many people choose this path because it feels easier in the short term.

**Option 2: Continue Growing Despite Resistance**  
You could maintain your commitment to personal development, even if it creates relationship friction. This path requires courage but often leads to better long-term outcomes.

## 🦋 The Butterfly Principle in Real Life

Imagine a caterpillar that's about to transform into a butterfly. The caterpillar has spent its entire life crawling, eating leaves, and living a ground-based existence. But when it's time to evolve, it must leave that familiar world behind to embrace flight.

Similarly, when you outgrow old patterns and limitations, you might find that some relationships no longer serve your highest good. This doesn't make you a bad person – it makes you someone committed to reaching your full potential.

## 📝 Practical Steps for Navigating Growth-Related Relationship Challenges

### 1. **Honest Self-Assessment** �mirror
Ask yourself:
- What specific changes have I made in my life?
- How is my partner responding to these changes?
- Am I being pressured to abandon my growth?
- Do I feel supported or held back in this relationship?

### 2. **Open Communication** 💬
Have a calm, honest conversation with your partner about:
- Your personal growth journey and why it matters to you
- How you'd like them to support your development
- What you're willing to compromise on and what you're not
- Your vision for the relationship moving forward

### 3. **Set Clear Boundaries** 🚧
- Don't allow others to sabotage your progress
- Protect time and energy for activities that support your growth
- Refuse to engage in conversations that tear you down
- Be consistent with your new standards and expectations

### 4. **Evaluate Compatibility** 🧩
Consider whether your relationship can adapt to accommodate growth from both parties:
- Is your partner willing to grow alongside you?
- Do they respect your journey, even if they're not ready for their own?
- Can you both support each other's individual development?
- Are your core values and life goals still aligned?

### 5. **Make Informed Decisions** ⚖️
Based on your assessment, you might need to:
- Work together on improving the relationship dynamics
- Seek couples counseling or mediation
- Take a temporary break to reassess
- Accept that you've grown in different directions and part ways amicably

## 🌱 Choosing Growth Without Guilt

One of the hardest parts of this process is dealing with guilt. Society often tells us that loyalty means staying the same or sacrificing our potential for others. But consider this: by becoming your best self, you're actually giving more to the world and to future relationships.

You're not responsible for other people's growth timeline or their resistance to change. Everyone develops at their own pace, and trying to force someone else's evolution while suppressing your own rarely works.

## 💪 Building Resilience During Transitions

Change is never easy, especially when it involves relationships that have been important to you. Here are some ways to build emotional resilience during these transitions:

**Create a Support Network** 🤝  
Surround yourself with people who celebrate your growth and encourage your development. This might include mentors, friends who share your values, or professional communities related to your interests.

**Practice Self-Compassion** 💖  
Be patient with yourself during this process. It's normal to feel sad, confused, or scared when relationships change. These feelings don't mean you're making the wrong choice.

**Focus on Your Long-term Vision** 🎯  
Remember why you started this growth journey in the first place. What kind of person do you want to become? What kind of life do you want to create? Use these goals to guide your decisions.

**Invest in Personal Development** 📚  
Continue learning, whether through books, courses, therapy, or new experiences. The more you invest in yourself, the more confident you'll become in your choices.

## 🌟 Attracting Aligned Relationships

When you choose growth over stagnation, you naturally begin attracting people who share similar values and aspirations. These relationships tend to be:

- Based on mutual respect and admiration
- Supportive of individual goals and dreams  
- Built on healthy communication and conflict resolution
- Focused on shared growth and learning
- Emotionally mature and stable

## 🔮 The Long-term Perspective

Think about where you want to be in 5, 10, or 20 years. Do you want to look back with regret, knowing you held yourself back to maintain relationships that ultimately limited your potential? Or do you want to feel proud of the courage you showed in choosing growth, even when it was difficult?

The skills you develop through prioritizing your personal growth – resilience, self-awareness, boundary-setting, and emotional intelligence – will serve you for the rest of your life. These qualities can't be taken away from you, regardless of what happens to any particular relationship.

## 🎪 Practical Daily Applications

Here's how to apply these principles in everyday life:

**Morning Routine** 🌅  
Start each day with activities that support your growth: reading, journaling, exercise, meditation, or skill-building. This sets a positive tone and reinforces your commitment to development.

**Boundary Practice** 🛡️  
When someone tries to discourage your progress or pull you into old patterns, politely but firmly redirect the conversation or remove yourself from the situation.

**Regular Check-ins** 📊  
Schedule weekly or monthly self-assessments to evaluate your relationships and growth progress. Are you moving in the direction you want to go?

**Celebration Ritual** 🎉  
Acknowledge your growth milestones, no matter how small. This reinforces positive change and builds momentum for continued development.

## 🎭 Addressing Common Concerns

**""But I've invested so much time in this relationship!""**  
Time already spent shouldn't trap you in a situation that no longer serves you. Consider it valuable experience that taught you what you need in future relationships.

**""What if I'm being selfish?""**  
Choosing growth isn't selfish – it's responsible. By becoming your best self, you have more to offer the world and future relationships.

**""What if I end up alone?""**  
Temporary solitude while you develop yourself is often preferable to permanent limitation in an incompatible relationship. Plus, personal growth typically leads to stronger, more fulfilling connections.

**""What if they change too?""**  
That's wonderful if it happens naturally! But trying to force someone else's timeline rarely works and often creates resentment on both sides.

## 🚀 Moving Forward with Confidence

Remember that choosing growth over comfort is one of the bravest decisions you can make. It requires trusting in your ability to create a better future, even when you can't see exactly how it will unfold.

Every successful person, innovator, and leader has faced moments where they had to choose between staying safe and taking a leap toward their potential. The ones who chose growth are the ones who created lives they're proud of and relationships that truly support their highest good.

Your development isn't just about you – when you become your best self, you inspire others to do the same. You contribute more to your community, you model possibility for the next generation, and you create a ripple effect of positive change.

## 🎯 Final Thoughts: Your Growth Matters

You deserve relationships that celebrate your evolution rather than try to contain it. You deserve to explore your full potential without guilt or apology. You deserve to surround yourself with people who inspire you to keep growing rather than pressure you to stay small.

The journey of personal development is lifelong, and the relationships that support this journey are precious. Don't settle for connections that require you to dim your light or abandon your dreams.

Trust the process, be patient with yourself during transitions, and remember that every choice you make in favor of your growth is an investment in a more fulfilling future.

Your wings weren't given to you to keep folded – they were given to you to soar. 🦅

I didn’t want to repeat the cycle of my dad — in and out of jail, in and out of our lives, lost on drugs. I knew deep down I could be the man I was created to be, but I had no idea how to get there.

Drugs were normal in my house growing up. My dad was locked up most of my life, so I started smoking weed at 15, then pills, then meth. Before long I was in and out of jail myself. One judge told me straight: “Next time, I’m sending you down the road.” But I kept slipping back.

One night I fought with my girl, and she wouldn’t let me back in. She had my son, and I knew if I stayed in Clayton County, I’d go right back to the streets. I asked her to take me to my uncle Brad’s house, and the next day he and my grandfather helped me get to A Better Way.

Pulling up, I was nervous, but I also felt blessed — like God was giving me a chance to finally change. The brotherhood here is what carried me. These men became my family. We push each other, pray with each other, and remind each other that God’s not done with us.

On the Florida trip, sitting in morning devotions with good coffee, quiet, and God’s Word, I felt His peace. When I stepped into the water and got baptized, I came out with a joy and relief I can’t describe. God restored my mind, my family, and my purpose.

Today, A Better Way has made me a better father, son, and brother. My kids have their dad back. My sister hears from me every day. My family trusts me again. If it weren’t for this place, I’d either be in prison or dead. But now I know God saved me to lead my family and live the life He called me to.",2,1756405814.0,TheTestimonyOfJesus,0,1.0,False

>Spent 6 of the last 10 years locked up. Addiction. Crime. Wreckage. This is about owning the damage, learning hard truths in a cell, and the slow crawl back to feeling human. If you're on the same path, maybe this is your sign to turn around.

Hello everyone,

I'm just going to jump right in.

How do you start feeling like a normal person again after years of wreckage?

I was released from jail in April 2025 after serving 15 months. Over the last 11 years, I’ve spent nearly 6 of them locked up—provincial and federal time. I struggled with addiction—crystal meth for years, then eventually fentanyl.

I’m 34. No real skills. No real friends (not because I don’t have any—I just don’t reach out). No savings. A family I’ve severely strained. My license is suspended indefinitely, and I’ve hurt people—damaged their lives and sense of safety—with my actions.

I made a lot of impulsive choices that had real consequences. Not just for me—but for my family, my partners, strangers. For a long time I thought, “It’s my life. If I screw it up, that’s on me.” I didn’t understand why my aunt was pissed I crashed my car. Like, wtf—it wasn’t your car, you never even had a car. Why are you mad?

Now I get it.

It wasn’t about the car.

I’ve had a lot of time—weeks, months, years—to lay on a shitty foam mattress and pick apart the moments that led me there. And here’s the thing: it’s easy to say you’re going to change when you’re in jail. You’re sober. You’re stuck. You start appreciating small things—an extra banana, a third bedsheet.

But what’s hard is figuring out what that change actually looks like when you get out.

The justice system isn’t built for rehabilitation—it’s overcrowded, underfunded, and more about warehousing than healing. You’ve got gangs, junkies, and repeat offenders. I was one of the repeats.

Most people think jail is just about losing freedom. But the real weight is knowing you’re not getting out until a judge says so, no matter how sorry you are. I used to dream I could sneak out at night and be back by morning, only to wake up still in that cell, court date months away.

I didn’t claim a gang or rip people off—your reputation is everything inside. I kept my head down, did my time, and learned more about loyalty, respect, and family in jail than I ever did outside. And yeah, I fought—not because I wanted to, but because sometimes you have to. For someone who’s always struggled with self-worth, standing up for myself—even in there—taught me what it meant to be dependable. Real.

I’ve always carried shame and guilt. I’ve wanted to reach out to the people I’ve hurt. Not to erase what I did—but to own it. I don’t believe I’m a bad person. I was a good person numbing pain in a really f\*\*\*ed up way.

I numbed reality. I numbed consequences. I numbed the years, the friendships, the lovers, the losses.

One time, I tattooed “No Regret” on myself during a bid—because f\*\*\* it, why not? Later, I kept asking myself: Do I really believe that? No regret? What does that even mean? That I don’t feel remorse? That I accept everything? Or that I don’t want to live in the past?

That question made me really examine the cycle—why I kept going back, why I kept making the same choices even though I knew how it ended.

Here’s what hurts most: I finished high school with honours. Got scholarships to every university I applied to. And yet… I ended up stealing cars, robbing businesses, cutting drugs, living on the run, constantly looking over my shoulder.

I turned my adult life into a mirror of my childhood—chaos, pain, and neglect. Probably sounds like textbook trauma response. I don’t know. But it fits.

I know this is long. I’ve never talked about any of this. I’ve just… lived it.

I’ve been out four months. Mostly at home. Making better choices—mostly. But I struggle with the basics. Like just feeling like a normal person. Like someone with normal, everyday problems. I’ve become institutionalized. I’ve become desensitized.

I forget what it’s like to meet friends for a drink, or just talk about life. I’m working on that.

I’ve tried to take accountability. I was adopted into an amazing family—people who gave me more love than I ever had. And yeah… I hurt them the most.

I thought they were abandoning me by leaving me in jail. I told myself I wouldn’t go back after I got out. But when I did go back, they didn’t want me there. That hit harder than any sentence.

I thought, “They adopted me—they’re supposed to love me unconditionally.” But that was the addict talking. That was entitlement. I thought I knew better. I didn’t.

I’ve lived a weird life.

Born Native/white. Foster homes. Bible study. Adopted by a Jewish family at 10. I’ve flown in private jets and slept in jail cells. I’ve watched a girl shoot heroin into her jugular. I’ve robbed high end houses in the same neighbourhoods I used to live in. I’ve been charged with “prowl by night”—makes me sound like a damn predator, I was lost... google maps took me to this guys backyard... Iunno 🤷‍♂️🫤

(And yeah—I know exactly what I was doing, but still.)

I could keep going. I’ve got stories. Regrets. Lessons. And yeah, plenty of f\*\*\*ups.

Maybe this post helps no one.

But maybe one person reads this and decides to change their path.

That would be enough.

I’ve lived the fast life, And yeah, I won’t lie. I had some fun.

But I’ve learned something important:

Fun is loud.

Happiness is calm.

My happiest memories aren’t wild ones. They’re the quiet ones—

a coffee at a lookout,

a night on a rooftop, watching the city breathe.

Simple. Honest. Real.

✒️ If you read this far—thank you. I’m still figuring it out. Still trying.

And maybe that’s the first real step.

I love coffee, I love chatting with people, and most of our regulars are genuinely kind and generous tippers. But lately, the repetition is really starting to get to me. This shop is probably 80% regulars, which is sweet, but it means I’m seeing the same faces, making the same drinks, and having the same conversations every single day.

I don’t think he should be allowed in the grocery store since he’s knowingly going after the underage employees. In his mind he’s some kinda mafia man or something it’s just disgusting and someone needs to serve him an extra hot coffee, it’s just like a slap in the face that he’s able to continue this charade.

Years ago, we had one that closed and the space became a CVS. It made me wonder: do ""big box"" comebacks shift consumer behavior in small towns? Will local bookstores feel an impact? Possibly, but the truly devoted customers will probably keep supporting them. Will I skip local brewery restaurants with a honeygrow nearby? Doubtful. People form strong allegiances, not just to brands, but to experiences. The local coffee shop loyalist doesn’t suddenly switch to Wawa because it’s convenient. The indie bookstore browser may see Barnes & Noble as a different experience, not a replacement. Personally, B&N was formative for me. I used to camp out in their web development section for hours, treating it like a free university. Many in Philly used the Rittenhouse Square one as an urban rest stop. It later doubled as a family-friendly community hub. Big box returns bring the competition, but they also shape local culture. Are big-box revivals more of a threat or opportunity for small towns?",9,1756405526.0,montco,14,0.91,False

First time writing and just go by what inspires me, especially Stolen Tongues. Any critiques or ideas welcome!","The night was bitterly cold and dark. Snow laid like a sheet over the earth, forming the previous landscape into dunes of stark white. Slush becomes the earth’s new face. Snowflakes still falling from the heavens in droves, a young man runs through the forest of dead oak and living pine. Coming out of the tree line, he jumps over the fence of a house’s backyard, runs to a basement window, opens it, and slips in. He hurriedly brushes the snow off of his clothes and kicks off his boots, shoving them into a corner. 

    Even through the darkness of the night, he can make out the shapes of the furniture and sneaks around them, going up the stairs as quietly as he can. Every step is a possibility for a creak, any noise that might alert others to his presence. The kid tenses at each step he takes, bracing himself in the case he gets caught. Eventually, he makes it to the top of the staircase and relaxes, breathing a sigh of relief. He opens the door only to be met with the blinding light of the ceiling lights and the looming figure of his father. 
    
    “Where on Earth have you been at this hour? Did you go to that place again? How many times do we have to tell you: that place is dangerous,” the father says sternly, interrogating his son. “Empty your pockets, now.”
    
    The son rolls his eyes and sighs. He slowly takes out a packet of marijuana, a few dollars, and spare change from his pockets and sets them down on the living room coffee table. He tries to walk away to his room, but his father stops him, grabbing him by his shoulders.
    
    “You’re sixteen years old, you should know better by now! You’re not going to your room or anywhere else; your mother’s already called the sheriff’s office.”
    
    “What the hell, Dad? You guys called the cops before I even came home?”
    
    “Yes, because you’ve proven to us time and time again that you can’t be trusted. We’ve tried being lenient, but this is the final straw, Jake. Hopefully you’ll actually learn something this time.”
    
    Jake huffs frustratedly, his mind burning with anger and feelings of unfairness. *Every one of my friends’ parents aren’t assholes like mine,* he thinks to himself.  
    
    After a short time, with Jake forced to sit in a chair, fuming, and his father staring him down, a knock raps on the front door. Jake’s father says another kind of threat to Jake and opens the door to greet the town sheriff. 
    
    “Good evening, Mr. Allen. I understand there’s some trouble with Jake again?” the sheriff says casually. 
    
    “Yes, sir.” Jake’s dad affirms. They cross through the house to the living room, where Jake is sitting, arms crossed, in front of the bag of marijuana. Jake makes no acknowledgement of the sheriff’s presence. 
    
    “Well, marijuana, eh, son?” the sheriff sits down across from Jake. “That could be six months you’re looking at.”
    
    Jake looks at the sheriff, shocked. “Six months? Are you serious?”
    
    “Yup. It’ll take a few days for the jury trial to be set up, so imma have to bring you to the station until then.”
    
    The sheriff puts Jake in the back of his car and drives off to the jail. Pulling up, he hears Jake continuing to grumble under his breath; most likely some kind of obscenities about his parents. The sheriff takes Jake out of the car and brings him to a cell, passing some of the other officers. “‘Evening, Sheriff,” some of them greet. 
    
    After locking Jake up again, the sheriff goes back out to his car. He grunts as he gets in and takes a sip of the coffee from the station. Then, he gets a call from the radio. 
    
    “Chief, we’ve got a complaint from Old Finn saying something took one of his sheep,” the radio chirps.
    
    “Copy, on my way,” the sheriff responds. He puts the car in gear and drives to the other side of town, not a far distance from the station, being a small town. He pulls up to the scene, gets out and puts on his winter jacket on top of the jacket he was already wearing; the air is like icicles to the bones. 
    
    “Hey there, Liam.” “‘Evening, Mike.” the two officers greet each other. “What’re we looking at?” Sheriff Liam asks. 
    
    “Seems like it could just be coyotes as usual, but Old Finn swears it’s something else; says he’s never seen anything like this before,” Mike Larson, the undersheriff, explains. Liam looks around, blowing into his hands and rubbing them together. 
    
    “Let me talk to him. Where is he?”
    
    “He’s inside the house, by the fire. I told him to try and get warm and let us take care of this.”
    
    Liam nods and walks over towards Old Finn’s house. On the way, he notices a small part of the fence in front of the treeline is broken, shattered to splinters. *Never seen a coyote do that. Could be a bear,* Liam thinks to himself. He steps up to the door and knocks, saying that it’s Sheriff Liam. Old Finn yells to let himself in. Opening the door, the room is shrouded in darkness, aside from the crackling fire in the center of the room, casting dancing shadows on the walls. Liam walks through the shadows and sits across from Old Finn, who’s sitting in a rocking chair right next to the fireplace. His boots propped up against the wall and his gloves placed on the mantle. The flames illuminate the old man’s face in a peculiar way, accentuating every aged line on the man’s face, his eyes gleaming in the crackling light. 
    
    “What exactly did you see, Mr. Finn?” Liam asks after some time of them both staring into the depths of the fire. 
    
    Without looking away from the flames, Old Finn says, “I know it ain’t no coyote. I didn’t get a good look at the thing itself, but it was big and long. By the time I got my flashlight out, it was gone.”
    
    “Are you sure it couldn’t have been a big bear? They’re known to sometimes take from farms.”
    
    “I’ve lived here for fifty-eight years, sheriff. This was no bear.”
    
    “And you’re certain it wasn’t a coyote or wolf?”
    
    “Those don’t get that big.”
    
    “What time did you see it?”
    
    “1 AM last night.”
    
    Liam, taking notes the entire time, gets up and says, “Okay, thank you for your time, Mr. Finn. We’ll have a look around and see if we can come to any concrete conclusions.” He walks out of the embers’ light and out of the house. He approaches his undersheriff, Mike, who’s kneeling in the snow near the broken fence. 
    
    “Talked with Old Finn. Says it couldn’t have been a coyote or bear and whatever it was was *big*. Whatever he saw, must’ve shook him something crazy; he never looked away from the fireplace.” Liam recounts to Mike, looking at the notes he took. 
    
    Mike ignores Liam’s notes, and instead calls out, “Liam, you gotta take a look at this.” 
    
    Liam raises an eyebrow and walks over to Mike and kneels next to him, seeing what he was talking about. The snow in this area was quite disturbed, looking like a splash in a pool. The center of this small crater in the snow was stained with blood. Liam stands up from his kneeling stature and takes out his flashlight to see the forest. Even with the light of the flashlight, the darkness of the forest is an abyss where light goes to die. The flashlight’s gleam can barely pierce through the thick dark, only showing a few yards into the forest. Liam turns his flashlight off, staring into the eternal darkness beyond the fence. 
    
    “Guess this is where the sheep got took,” Mike says sarcastically, a light chuckle in the back of his throat. Liam nods slightly, and notices small dents in the snow sheet. Must be some footprints being covered up by the continuing snowfall. 
    
    “Yeah.”
    
    
    
    Dawn the next morning. The snowfall stopped sometime before the morning. Three hunters are creeping through the snow-ridden forest, two carrying rifles, bolt action with scopes, and the other having nothing but a camera and a rangefinder. Decked out in winter camo, the hunters follow a set of deer tracks. Judging by the hoofprints, the deer is in no hurry, evidently not being privy to the hunters’ presence. However, after following the tracks for an hour or so, they suddenly stop in front of a group of vines. One of the hunters with a rifle bends down to take a better look at the disappearing tracks, noticing another set appearing out of nowhere, these ones much larger than the hoofprints of the deer. The hunter motions for the others to look, and they notice the strangeness of these tracks; the hind legs have four long clawed toes, whereas the front limbs appear to be knuckles. Similarly to the deer tracks, these prints disappear into thin air. The hunter with the camera begins taking pictures of the anomalies, figuring that they might be useful in case the group finds anything else strange or out of place. 
    
    After a while of searching, one of the hunters, this one with a beard, notices claw marks on the trunk of a tree. He calls out to the others and strokes the scratch marks, recognizing them as all being vertical and deep. As he looks up, he sees the deer they’ve been tracking. The deer strung up in the branches of the tree, at least sixty feet up. Its carcass strewn across several branches, viscera and tendons exposed. A gruesome mockery of a dreamcatcher. One leg here, another leg there, all showing signs that it was caught by a voracious animal. As the other hunters come to his side, the hunter with a beard points up at the remnants of the deer. The hunter with the rangefinder, Joel, uses it to get a closer look at the corpse. He sees the torn ligaments, the blood spattered across the bark, and peculiarly, the head was missing entirely. 
    
    Joel recounts his findings to the other hunters and takes pictures of everything, the disappearance of the tracks, the claw marks, and the carcass up in the trees. All three agree to make their way back to town, about a few hour’s hike down the mountain. 
    
    Joel had lived with the forest all his life; he saw it as a friend, something always there and welcoming to explore. Sure, if you’re not careful it will chew you up and spit you out, but Joel always respected the trees and the tales they could tell with their bark. However, on the hike back, Joel did not feel welcomed. The forest no longer felt like a friend; it felt malicious. Every twig snap would have Joel looking around, panicked. The mystery of the forest for the first time felt evil. 
    
    As soon as they got into town, they told everyone they knew about what they saw. Gossip spread like a plague, hopping from neighbor to neighbor until the entire town heard about the horrific image of the deer in the trees. Despite how early in the morning it was, it seemed everyone was awake. It wasn’t long before the sheriff got wind of it too, in fact he got many calls that morning, nearly one every other minute. Eventually he started answering the calls with “This is Sheriff Liam, and yes I know about the deer.” 
    
    Liam answered the calls before he even got a chance to get to the station or even get dressed. Eventually, when he made it to the station, fully clothed, it seemed the entire town was inside the station, talking and yelling over each other. The very air seemed to vibrate with all of the complaints and questions. Undersheriff Mike was trying his best to calm everyone down when Liam arrived, and shot Liam a look that clearly said “please help.” The sheriff elbowed people out of the way and grabbed the bell from the receptionist desk and started ringing it over and over again, stood up on a chair, and yelled “Hey! Hey! HEY!
    
    “Now I know you all have plenty of questions, but we don’t have the answers quite yet. I’ll be working the best I can to figure out what’s going on out there but until then, no one’s going out to do their own research and no one is going into the woods.”
    
    At this last statement, many yelled vehemently, stating how outrageous it is to not go in the woods hunting in the middle of deer season, as well as calling Sheriff Liam some unpleasant names. 
    
    “I know, I know, I know. But it’s for your own safety. We have no idea what’s out there, so until we do, everyone just follow the rules,” Liam said disgruntled. 
    
    The chatter of the room ceased, replaced with various questioning mutters.  Liam hopped down from the chair and pushed past people to get back outside, trying to signify to the people that this decision was final. When he got outside, he fumbled with his jacket pocket and brought out a cigarette and lit it. Taking a few draws, he began to think to himself. *Cougars don’t normally bring their prey into trees, neither do bears. Don’t know if this is the same thing that took Old Finn’s sheep, but if it is, we gotta find it soon.* 
    
    It wasn’t long until Undersheriff Mike joined Liam outside, deeply exhaling, mist coming out from his mustache-covered mouth. 
    
    “What do you wanna start with?” Mike asked, already sounding tired of the whole business. 
    
    “Well I want to hear what Joel, Bill, and Tommy saw out there from them first. Then we can start searching the area and see if we can find anything to go on from there,” and after a pause, “Also check Old Finn’s barn again, see if there's any connections.” 
    
    “Gonna be a long few days.”
    
    “Gonna be a long few weeks.”
    
    Liam got back into his car and sat there for a minute. He thought about how looking into the forest made him feel so… entranced. He dreamt of it last night: the treeline blending into an endless chasm, an overwhelming urge to go into the abyss, where the light cannot pierce. A call that didn’t come from the forest itself, but something beyond it, something under it. A call that gripped Liam’s stomach. He knew that it was just a forest, a thing always present in Canada, but something in his gut told him there was something different out there, something that wanted him. 
    
    Liam opened his eyes, not realizing he had closed them. He shook his head to rid himself of the memories and started his car. He refused the thoughts of the forest to come back during the whole drive to Bill’s house. Upon getting to Bill's House, Liam saw that he was out on his porch with a bottle of bourbon and a pack of cigarettes by his rocking chair. Bill didn’t say anything when Liam got out of his car and approached the house. The following excerpt is from Liam’s notes: 

Bill’s quiet, won’t talk unless prodded

Bourbon bottle almost empty

Dark circles under eyes, probably didn’t sleep

Mentions the blood from the deer often 

Deer was in pieces, torn apart

Every light was on in the house

    After the questioning, Liam thanked Bill for his time and went back to his car. He started up the old engine again and puttered to Joel’s house, as it was closer than Tommy’s. Upon getting to Joel’s house, Liam noticed he wasn’t outside like Bill. Liam knocked on the door and rang the doorbell. Nothing. He tried again. Nothing. He stepped back and saw that Joel’s truck was still there. Liam tried knocking on the door again to no avail. 

“Shit. Why now?” Liam muttered under his breath. He wrote that Joel isn’t at home and may be missing. On his way back to the car, Liam took a look at the snow in case there were footprints. Aside from his own, there were none. Liam called Mike on the radio. 

“Hey, Mike, I finished with Bill and went to Joel’s but he’s not home. His car’s still there and there aren’t any footprints. Mind taking a closer look at it for me?”

“Geez, this town’s falling apart. You sure he wasn’t just asleep?”

“No yeah he must just be asleep,” Liam said sarcastically. “Of course he’s not asleep. Just take care of it while I ask Tommy what he saw and I’ll come back.”

“Alright, I’m on it.”

Liam made it to Tommy’s and got out of the car as soon as he turned off the engine. He reached the door and gave it a few knocks. From within the house, he heard the sound of someone walking around, changing pace from slow to fast and slow again. After a couple of minutes, Liam knocked again. The walking sounds continued, but no one answered the door. Liam leaned into the door to listen closer, and he heard the faint sounds of someone talking. Curiously, there was no evidence of someone other than Tommy being in the house. Liam tried knocking again and yelled to Tommy that the sheriff was here and he just wanted to ask some questions about last night, but nothing changed; the sounds of walking and talking persisted. 

Liam walked back to his car and flung the door open. His mind raced with questions: *Why didn’t Tommy answer? Did he hear me? Where’s Joel? Did Joel ever come home? What took the sheep? What dismantled the deer? Are they the same thing?* Upon arriving at Joel’s house and getting out of the car, Liam saw Mike walking around the house. 

“Hey, Liam. I looked around outside, and didn't see any signs that he ever came home. You think he just walked out of town? It doesn’t make any sense,” Mike inquired. 

“Hmm. Alright. Let’s take a look inside, see if we can find anything.”

The two tried the door, and surprisingly, it was unlocked. Stepping over the threshold, the inside of the house looked just as inconspicuous as the outside. Nothing looked strange or out of place. Papers were unmoved, coffee was still in the pot, the laptop was on, dishes were in the sink, and the bed was unmade; there weren’t any notes or signs that Joel had any intention to disappear. 

Mike clapped his hands together and clicked his tongue, “Great. Now we’ve got a misper on top of all of this. What the hell happened over the last few days?”

“I don’t know,” Liam said as he leaned against the wall and updated his notes with the recent discoveries. “Tommy seemed to be home, but he didn’t answer the door. By the sounds of it, he was walking around his house and just talking to himself. Don’t have a search warrant, and it’s gonna be next to impossible to get one.” 

Liam pushed himself off the wall and shuffled his way to the porch. Mike caught up with him and they both stood outside, breathing in the crisp air, mist coming out of their mouths with every breath. Mike adjusted his trapper hat and fidgeted with his fingers. 

“Should we get some volunteers to help search the forest?” Mike asked. 

“No. We gotta search the immediate area and make sure whatever it is isn’t anywhere around before thinking of getting these folks out in the woods,” Liam said. 

“Alright. Meet you outside Ms. Carrie’s place?”

“Sounds good.”

Mike walked to his car, but Liam stayed for a few minutes, standing on Joel’s front porch. He filled his lungs with the cool, calm air, reflecting on the past few days and their strangeness. After a minute or two he stretched, cracked his back, and got in his car. Making his way to Ms. Carrie’s property, Liam noticed a lot of people outside, more than usual. Neighbors spoke in hushed voices as they gossiped in each other’s driveways and kids ran around chaotically in a tense game of snowball tag. 

When arriving at Ms. Carrie’s home, Liam pulled up next to Mike’s police car. The house was a pale yellow and white that blended almost seamlessly into the snow. Behind the house stood the tall, dead trees, with snow gathered on their limbs. Liam got out of his car and shuffled his way through the snow on his way to join Mike, standing near the entrance into the forest. 

“How far were they in the forest?” Mike asked. 

“Said they were a few miles in, around the area of the old sawmill,” Liam said. 

Mike groaned and the two began their trek through the forest. Upon stepping into the woods, Liam noticed a shift in the weather. It was colder, but not the type of cold one would expect on this side of New Brunswick. It was strange; unnatural. Outside the forest, a mist would billow from his mouth with each breath. In the forest, the air was crisper, almost sharp. The cold pierced through jacket and coat, through skin and flesh, striking directly to the bone. Mike zipped up his outermost coat and Liam stuffed his hands into gloves he kept in his coat pocket. The two trudged through the forest, one step at a time. As they traveled further and further in, Liam’s paranoia only grew. He could’ve sworn something was peeking out from behind that tree, or that there was movement off in the distance of  something stalking him. For the remainder of their hike, neither man spoke, continuing on in uneasy silence. 

Finally, after hours and hours, they reached the old sawmill. Dead, brown vines covered the building in a tarp of decay. The old metal had rusted due to decades worth of melted snow, and the front door had fallen off its hinges completely. The wood paneling was stained with age, rotting. The snow was even thicker up here, being higher on the mountain than the town. Whatever trees the sawmill had cut down had been replaced twofold by nature. Some stumps remained; notches in the history book of the woods. 

“Jesus, finally,” Mike broke the silence. Liam groaned and stretched his legs; his knees weren’t built for this anymore. He nodded to Mike to start looking for the tracks. 

The two began searching for the strange tracks they had heard about. Any dent in the snow was scanned, any deviation from the dunes of white. Liam started looking at the trees, trying to see if he somehow would find one that had the scratch marks, or perhaps dried blood on the ground from the deer in the trees. Eventually, the tracks of the three hunters were found by Mike. Liam and he followed them for several minutes, when suddenly, they stopped. 

It was Joel. 

He sat on the ground, his back leaning against a tree. His condition was horrible; his skin was blackened and withered to leather, stretched taut across his flesh and bone. Muscle striations and individual tendons could be seen through the skin, which steamed, even in the cold. The heat from Joel’s body could be felt from several yards away. His flesh reeked of rot and decay, a smell that made Liam sick to his stomach, nearly doubling over. Joel’s eyes were gone, yet peculiarly, his clothes were completely fine. No burn mark or scratch or any sign of damage showed. His face was turned upwards towards the sun, with his mouth agape in a ghastly, silent imitation of a scream. 

“Christ,” Mike yelled, covering his nose with his coat. “Jesus, how the hell did this happen?”

“He wasn’t gone for very long, and there’s no sign of a fire,” said Liam. He approached what used to be Joel carefully. 

Liam reached Joel, covering his nose and mouth. A closer look only confirmed what was seen from further away: somehow Joel was burnt without burning anything else. Liam noticed something else on the ground, and after bending down, found Joel’s camera. Like his clothes, Joel’s camera showed no sign of damage. Liam carried the camera away and towards Mike. 

“Is that his camera?” Mike said in a voice muffled by his coat. 

Liam opened the viewfinder on the side of the camera and switched through the pictures: a doe, a squirrel on a tree, a sunset, a flower from his home, strange tracks in the snow, scratches on a tree, a few of the deer in the trees, and a blurry picture taken at night with the flash on. Liam and Mike leaned in to discern what the picture was of, and saw the blurry image of a… small tree? It could’ve been some kind of a figure, but it seemed too tall and thin to be an animal. 

“He took this last night? Doesn’t seem like he meant to take it. Just what in God’s name was he doing?” Liam said, more so thinking out loud than to Mike. Liam noted everything captured in his notebook. 

“None of this makes any sense. Should we get Williams and Barlowe out here?”

“Yeah, and everyone else too. Got to get people searching through the forest looking for whatever this thing is.”

“Isn’t that kind of dangerous? I mean Joel is… well….”

“We’re not gonna get volunteers just yet; only people from the station then there won’t be an issue.”

Liam started on the way back to town, not wanting to argue with Mike. They both took the long, arduous journey back. Getting out of the forest proved difficult, however. 

Liam and Mike stepped through the snow-ridden forest; the slumbering trees loomed over them. Liam had lived his entire life in the town, and therefore knew his way around the forest. If need be, he could get to the sawmill with his eyes closed. Mike had moved to the town several years prior, but was also familiar with the landscape. Anyone who chose to live in this small town would eventually know the forest like the back of their hand. 

But this time the forest did not want the officers to leave. 

Liam lagged behind Mike, and the countenance of the trees shifted. To the eyes of Liam, each crack in the bark grew deeper than usual. All of them seemed twice as tall as normal. Every shadow became more harsh in the world. It must still be afternoon, or maybe early evening. Was it morning? It can’t be night, can it? The sky was dark, and the stars appeared like holes poked in the black fabric covering the air. Despite the freezing weather, sweat grew on Liam’s brow. His eyes ached with a sting, his ears began to ring, his muscles began to give out and he stopped walking. Liam put his hand out to brace against a tree to gain balance, but the tree didn’t feel like bark; it squished. Turning his head to observe the tree, Liam saw a pillar of flesh, perhaps miles high. It bled, oozing blood from the crevices. What should be branches were human arms, elbows attached at ungodly angles, gnarled fingers stretched out to grasp. 

Liam jumped back and fell to the ground with a yell. Mike was several yards ahead and turned back, hand at his hip. He jogged towards Liam on the ground. 

“What happened?” Mike asked.

Liam said nothing. He lay there, panting, his heart pounding in his chest like a jackhammer. The tree was a tree. The sky was the normal pastel blue of mid day. 

“Liam, what happened?” Mike repeated. Mike helped Liam up on his feet and kept his hand on the sheriff’s shoulder. “Liam? Hey, talk to me here.” 

“I don’t know,” was all that Liam could muster. Was all of it in his head? Was any of it real? It certainly felt real. He could feel the pores of the flesh and could smell the iron in the blood. The chill of the night had coursed through his spine serpentine, and something cool had grasped his heart. The remnants of its fingers could still be felt. His eyes were glassed over in remembrance and shock. 

Mike studied Liam’s face and said, “Alright, let’s just get out of here and then you can catch your breath, okay?”

Liam nodded subtly, still trapped in his mind. 

The two made their way through the forest and back into town where Mike directed them to Cathleen’s Cozy Cafe and ordered coffees for himself and Liam. 

“Liam, what happened back there?” Mike asked again after sitting down and giving Liam a few minutes to gather his thoughts. Liam, clutching his hot coffee for warmth, closed his eyes to remember.

“I… I uh, I was just walking and then the forest, changed? It was, I don’t know, taller, more imposing. Darker. I thought it was night for a while. Um, and then the trees were, not trees. They had skin and bled. God, I don’t know. And then it was all back to normal,” Liam recounted. 

Mike sat for a minute, stunned into silence. “The trees became… flesh?”

“I don’t know what happened. I could feel it, too. You know back in school when teachers would give fun facts like a certain type of fungus can stretch for miles, all a part of the same organism? It was like that. Every ‘tree,’ everything in the forest was a part of one thing. I could *feel* that,” Liam paused, putting his head in his hands, talking to the black and white tiled floor. “I already feel like I’m going insane. You didn’t see anything? Feel anything?” he asked Mike suddenly, lifting his head up. 

“No. I mean it was a bit chillier than usual, but not concerningly so,” Mike answered, shaking his head. 

Liam sighed and put his head back in his hands, a prisoner to his own thoughts. Mike’s flip phone started to ring and he answered it, “Hey, darling, what’s up? Yeah, we’re good. I’m with Liam right now. Wait, wait, slow down. What? Okay, okay, I’ll be over in a minute.” Mike hung up the phone and turned to Liam. “I’m sorry, but my wife needs me. You take the rest of the day off, okay?”

“No, there’s still so much to-”

Mike cut him off. “No, just go home and take today to calm down.”

Liam relaxed his shoulders, letting them drop, resigning himself to Mike’s instruction. After all, he was right that Liam had to calm down; he could still feel his heart against his ribcage. 

The two made their way out of the cafe and back to their respective homes. Liam parked his car in his driveway and collected another cigarette as he got out. Unlocking and opening his front door, he stepped into the calming familiarity of his house. Taking a deep breath, he took off his coat and hung it up on the rack on the wall and kicked his boots off. He took his coffee with him through the short hallway and into his small living room, filled with a worn couch, coffee table, and a sad little TV in the corner. He turned on the fan and took some deep drags of the cigarette, letting the smoke fill his lungs. The classic combo of coffee and a cigarette occupied him for some time on his couch, but he still couldn’t think of anything except the events of the past few days. 

Liam realized that he still had Joel’s camera in his coat pocket, and leapt up to get it. His muscles surprisingly sore, he retrieved the camera and sat back down on the sofa, opening the viewfinder and taking out his notebook. He was never much of an artist, but he tried his best to replicate what was on the most recent image, the one of the strange tree or figure. 

His feet walk through the sun-baked sand, destination unknown. The salty air stings his nose as the foam of the sea dissipates across the sand Fingers dig through the ground as a warm film of water covers his hand. The man wanders through the beach with the stride of indecision

Did you do it again?

What again

The wrong thing

All I did was help

You left me.

You did. 

Sarah

Liam raised his head from the back of the couch and blinked his tired eyes. The sky was already a deep navy blue. He didn’t even realize he fell asleep. *Why am I dreaming of Sarah?* Liam questioned himself. *What is going on? It all happened so fast. Everything was normal and now trees are pillars of flesh and people are being burnt to husks.* 

Realizing his notebook was still in his hand, Liam glanced at it and noticed something weird: the page had been turned and on it “Visit again” was written over and over and over, sometimes overlapping with each other. Questions and panic flew through Liam’s mind as he realized Joel’s camera was gone. Standing up to begin looking for it, he noticed his front door was open ajar. 

“Oh shit,” Liam said aloud, a new, even more powerful wave of panic washing over him, making him tumble in the sea of fresh questions. Liam flattened himself against the wall of the hallway, drawing his revolver from its holster. Slowly, he creeped through his own home, sweeping all four rooms for intruders. No one was inside except him. Nothing was out of place. Liam lowered his revolver and nearly ran through the door outside. From his small porch Liam saw one set of footprints going into his home and back out. Paranoia growing, he tried calling Mike on the phone, but he didn’t answer. *Mike always answers, even when he’s busy,* Liam thought. Not wanting to waste any more time, he followed the tracks in nothing but his jeans and a long sleeve shirt to at least get some idea of who broke into his home. 

The tracks were perfectly straight, no change in direction or gait. Whoever it was, they made a beeline straight for Liam’s house and went right back. Soon, the footprints led Liam out of the light of the town, but he hesitated in bringing out his flashlight, not wanting to make his position obvious. Liam clicked the flashlight on, resting his right hand holding the revolver with an iron grip on top of his left, gripping his flashlight much tighter than he had to. After following the tracks for agonizing minutes, Liam came to their end. The footprints led to the edge of the forest, stopped, and turned around. 

“What?” Liam said. He double-checked the area, , circling around and studying every inch of snow, but there was nothing else. He stood up straight and felt the blood drain from his face. *Did I sleepwalk outside?* Glancing into the woods, Liam nearly took another step closer, but stopped himself, remembering how Mike didn’t answer his phone or call back. Liam holstered his six-shooter and checked his watch; 9:37. He jogged back to his house and grabbed his flip phone, seeing that Mike had tried to call him five times. He redialed the number and Mike immediately answered after one ring. 

“Mike, Mike, what happened?”

“My daughter’s fucking gone.”

What little color that was left in Liam’s face left immediately, his heart dropped into his stomach. *Do what you have to do,* he reminded himself, grabbed his coat, and sped his way to Mike’s house. Upon arriving, he hopped out of his car and saw Mike and his wife, Leah, holding hands outside in the cold. Mrs. Larson wore a fluffy robe of a light pink color. 

“What happened?” Liam immediately asked the both of them. 

“We don’t know, she’s just gone. No note or anything, just gone,” Mike answered for his wife, as dry and fresh tears streamed down her cheeks. 

“Any footprints?”

Leah let out a sob, yet she remained composed. Mike’s mustache was quivering and he held his cross necklace with white knuckles. 

“Just one set, outside of her window and towards the forest.”

\-

The next morning. Everyone from the police station gathered in the conference room, all with intense expressions. Mike’s eyes were puffy yet had a fire behind them. The group is seven in total with all but Liam sitting down. 

Liam spoke with a determined tone, “Okay. What we know so far is that something took Old Finn’s sheep that he claims wasn’t a regular animal. There was also a deer strewn up in the trees. Joel went back into the forest and somehow combusted. His camera captured several vertical scratch marks on trees,  a set of tracks unfamiliar to known animals, and what may be a humanoid figure.” Liam pinned printed copies of drawings he made to the best of his memory of Joel’s camera’s findings up on the bulletin board. 

“Wouldn’t we be able to print out the actual pictures Joel’s camera took? Why’re these just drawings?” one officer, Tyrell Smith, pointed out.

“Under normal situations, yes, but these are far from normal. Last night I woke up and noticed my door was open. I thought there was an intruder, but the footprints went to the edge of the forest and straight back to my home.”

“So you walked out?” Officer Earl Williams interjected. 

“Unfortunately that seems to be the only logical conclusion,” Liam answered. “Joel’s camera also went missing during my sleep. Furthermore, a similar thing happened with Mike’s daughter, although there were no footprints coming back from the forest.”

Some of the other officers rubbed their faces in concern. Officer Clark Armstrong patted Mike on the shoulder. 

“So was Emily kidnapped?” Tyrell Smith questioned. 

“No. The only footprints were hers, similar to my case the same night. The size of the footprints match Emily’s shoe size and appeared last night,” Liam said. “That’s everything we know for sure at this point, but I’m sure rumors are already spreading throughout town. It’s important that we find out what’s happening as soon as possible and even more importantly, find and rescue Emily.”

Mike sniffed at the last mention of his daughter, but kept the same expression of deep determination. 

“Williams, Barlowe, I need you guys to retrieve and perform an autopsy on Joel’s body. Whatever you can find out could help us figure this whole thing out. Armstrong and Belanger, you guys are going to go out and find more tracks of whatever might’ve taken Old Finn’s sheep and the deer. Something we don’t know is out there and it could be connected to what happened with Joel, Tommy, and Bill. Smith, Larson, and myself will find Emily.”

“She’s only eight years old,” Mike spat through gritted teeth. 

“Now it’s important to stay in the groups assigned to you; it could save your life. Watch each other’s backs,” Liam said, focusing on keeping the meeting concise. “Williams, Barlowe, Armstrong, and Belanger, you four can go into the forest together and split off around the old saw mill to your respective jobs. The three of us will follow Emily’s footprints. Alright, you guys keep each other safe and do not get complacent with procedure. Details matter.”

The other officers nodded and got up from their seats to leave the conference room. Tyrell Smith loitered outside the door, not following the four others out of the station. Mike and Liam met up with Tyrell and walked out of the police station, Liam and Tyrell grabbing outer coats on their way out. Mike stuck with his simple police jacket ignoring the cold. The three of them walked to the various police cars in the parking lot, some of them already igniting their tail lights, creating blades of red streaks across the wet pavement. 

“Is that really all the info we have?” Tyrell asked Liam. 

“That’s all we know for sure,” Liam answered monotone.

“Then what do you know not for sure?” Tyrell was really pressing Liam. Liam looked at Tyrell and paused a second. 

“I think I walked to the edge of the forest and gave back Joel’s camera in my sleep. ‘Visit again’ was written over and over in my notebook too. Whatever happened with me was in something else’s control, and it must have gotten to Emily somehow.”

Liam got in his own car and Tyrell took Mike in his truck. The two cars made their way to the Larson household. On the way, Liam couldn’t help but remember his dream from last night:

*Are you doing any good?* 

*Are you helping anyone?*

*You don’t even know what’s happening, do you?*

*She’s gone, Liam.* 

The myriad of different voices from his past taunted him. He had heard all of these words before, but never in that order, never in that context. When Liam woke up that morning, the faces those words belonged to were etched into his mind, like an image burned into a screen. “Are you doing any good?” was something a guy who had a few drinks at a bar asked Liam during his first year as a police officer. “Are you helping anyone?” was what his mother had asked when he first told her that he had become the sheriff. “You don’t even know what’s happening, do you?” was something Sarah said to him in pity. “She’s gone, Liam,” was one of the last things he had ever heard from his father. Their faces were clearly distinct in Liam’s memory, but those words were blending together as if said by one. The original meaning of them was starting to fade in the light of the recent context that they fit so awfully into. 

Liam blinked the tears that threatened to form out of his eyes as he pulled up to Mike’s driveway. Tyrell’s truck was already there and he and Mike were just getting out of it. Liam joined them in the front yard. 

“Okay, you guys all set?” Liam asked the pair. They nodded in agreement. “How’s Leah holding up?” Liam added.

“She’s taking it rough, but we’ll find her,” Mike spoke with the same determination that his eyes held.

Life was very tough for the past 12 months exactly when I got into my first job after college. The first job was straight up slavery. It was a office job . I worked 12+ hrs everyday, 13+ hrs for like 3-4 days a week, sunday only leave. Yes you can't take casual leave, they will cut the day. But it was interesting at the time,cause I did pretty well as a fresher. I learned things faster. It was good but not too long. As I learned things faster, I was given important tasks , the harder ones. It's so hard that I started questioning myself. My team expected things from me which I can't deliver. It was fucking hard. I stopped going to the gym (before the job, I have been going to the gym for like 2.5 years & built a above average physique which is still I'm proud of)  & now i lost muscles. After starting to get salary, i hesitated to ask money from my family & started to cut out things. Then the work came to the point where I can't able to work there under the pressure. I quit after lot of thinking about work life balance and shit after 6 month. At that point, i  thought life will be good if I get a new job but I didn't know i was completely wrong at the time. Then I joined another job. It was a site job(supervision). This is way worser than i expected, I have to travel 2 hours in dust and traffic to the site everyday. I was asked to work even on Sundays & extra hours everyday. My salary was just enough for the petrol & room rent expenses. I stopped eating breakfast & dinner that I replaced with a single glass of tea. I like coffee but that was 8 rupees extra costly so i preferred tea. I was treated badly & got blamed for silly & no reason. I lost 18kgs,(83 to 65), my shirts became looser. I became suicidal. I didn't wanted to hurt my loved ones. Thats the only thing stopped me from ending my life. I started to question my existence. One day, i lost my shit & scolded my project manager. Then I quit the job after working there 3 months only. A guy from my old company said ""you 2k kids don't know anything, don't want to work extra hours & stuff"". I still didn't know how we are different from them. I imagined life after college differently. Fuckk man, it was shit. Life was good when we were kids.  Now I'm working in a office 12-13 hrs a day. I'm used to this shit. I have no life outside work. It's been more than a year, i went to the gym. I'm scared of what I'm going to do in life. I don't have any friends after school except some from college. Sometimes I think like what's our purpose here. Neraya sollunum nu nenachen marandhuttan.... Sorry for the bad English. Just wanted to rant guys avlodhan bye....

1n2jz53,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1n2jz53/best_things_to_do_wineries_in_dundee_or/,"Best Things To Do + Wineries in Dundee, OR","Just got back from a day in Dundee and thought I’d share our little off-the-beaten-path itinerary since most people just hit the big-name wineries and call it good. Dundee is tiny, but if you do it right, it’s honestly one of the best wine tasting regions.

**Morning**  
We kicked things off with a stop at **Briar Rose Creamery**. It’s a small spot and is only open Friday and Saturday to the public but the cheese is ridiculously good (like, bring a cooler good). They have a cute little window you can walk up to and order chocolate cheese truffles and award winning fromage blanc.

**Lunch**  
Instead of the usual wine-country fine dining, we went casual. You can’t go wrong with **Wooden Heart** (cozy, seasonal menu, great coffee vibes), **Merenda Deli** (killer sandwiches with an authentic modern italian vibe and house-made everything), or **Red Hills Market** (the classic – wood-fired pizza and bakery stuff) with a large outdoor area. We went with Merenda and it hit the spot.

**Afternoon Wine Tasting**  
This was the highlight. We mapped out a little loop:

* **Artist Block** – super fun and approachable, not your typical serious tasting room. The vibe is artsy and playful, wines are delicious, they have a really fun cat, and they do cool events.
* **Alexana** – a contrast to Artist Block, but worth it for the stunning views, classic architecture, and polished wines.
* **Ambar** – tucked away and super charming, feels like a hidden gem with great meal pairings.
* **White Rose** – gorgeous spot with a very unique winemaking philosophy, plus the view of the valley is insane.

**Stretch Your Legs**  
After that much wine, we needed to walk it off, so we hit **Harvey Creek Trail**. It’s right outside of Dundee, not a long hike but enough to feel like you earned your next glass. Shady, quiet, and you probably won’t see many other people.

**Dinner**  
We wrapped the day at **JORY at The Allison Inn**. Honestly, it’s a splurge, but 100% worth it. Seasonal, thoughtful food, always consistent, great wine list (obviously), and the setting feels like the perfect finale to a Dundee day.",1,1756405213.0,travel,0,1.0,False
1n2jy4d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n2jy4d,OutIn Fino Portable Electric Coffee Grinder Review,"Hey everyone! How are you?

Since there aren't any reviews of OutIn's electric grinder here on the sub, I decided to talk a little about it.
I apologize in advance for the long post.

If you'd like to watch the video about noise testing, grinding levels, and cleaning: https://youtu.be/2U20uAW4P64?si=ortYvqk8qHE1kZWj

Fino Unboxing: https://youtube.com/shorts/hGDY3RBBHTI?si=FXGtihCIEwpMmiHc

When you receive the grinder, it's not fully charged. In fact, it doesn't come with enough battery to grind a single coffee. So, after removing the seal/stickers, you'll charge it. The charging port is on the back of the device.

 The manual recommends using the cable that comes with the grinder and a 5V/1A charger. Has the white light stopped flashing? That's it, it's fully charged. It takes about an hour to fully charge.

Clear/white light: 100%~30%.
Yellow light: 20% (I charge when the yellow light appears)
Red light: Charge the grinder.

Warning if you haven't respected the ""breathing time"" (90 seconds between grinds) or have ground for more than 5 minutes: The white light will flash three times and your grinder will stop working. I'm a bit of a wimp and I respected the recommended time. I haven't had any problems with this.

""Bean blockage"" warning (some beans are stuck): The red lights will flash. This happened to me. I tapped the side lightly, and the grinder corrected it, grinding the stuck beans during the next grind.  If that doesn't work: Disassemble (explained below) and clean.

Construction:

It's made of aluminum, silicone, and food-grade plastic. It has a 38mm conical (7-sided) blade, external adjustment, and a rubberized base to keep your grinder steady while working. It weighs 690 grams.

It has a great grip, and although I've only used it twice, I feel confident in saying it's comfortable to carry. With my bad arm, I managed to carry a backpack, a scale, the Nano, and a V60 with it. If I didn't feel uncomfortable, you certainly won't.

It's solid enough to stay on your countertop, yet light enough to carry in your backpack.

Passions aside, it's truly beautiful. You don't need to hide it in a cabinet. It's a device you're proud to have on your countertop (I'm trying to contain myself here, as I think the Fino is the most beautiful device in my setup).

Maximum capacity per grind:

25 grams. Can it handle 25 grams? Yes, but it can make a mess, and yes, this is very personal, but 25 grams per grind is a lot for me. I grind 5, 6, 16, and 18 grams. No mess and in what I consider to be a great time.

Grinding time:

The manual recommends a 90-second rest between grinds and not to grind for more than five minutes continuously.

 Some notes on grinding time:

Grinding 5 grams on click 1: 37 seconds

Grinding 15.5 grams on click 2: 58 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 3: 25 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 4: 25 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 5: 22 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 6: 18 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 7: 17 seconds

Grinding 16.2 grams on click 7: 48 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 8: 17 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 9: 15 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 10: 14 seconds

Grinding:

Uniform, consistent, generates very few fines and retention is minimal (in most cases).  Most of the time, I didn't experience any retention. I have a video showing this, in case anyone is interested. I took the photos at all grind levels. One additional note: I didn't clean (disassemble) the grinder between grinds. I started at 10 and worked my way down to 01, just to capture real-life use.
See the photos and let me know what you think.

Cleaning:

Using the key (it's inside the grinder box, next to the handle), turn it counterclockwise and remove the parts (memorize the order: screw, blade, spring. Use the opposite direction when assembling). Then, use the blower (they send one inside the box) and a dry, clean brush. Clean and reassemble.

Battery life:

Initially, I used it and didn't keep a count. For this analysis, I grinded 19 grinds of different sizes and weights, and the battery indicator remains white (100%~30%).  During the 19 grinds, I ground about 150 grams of coffee.

Noise:

In my opinion, the noise is completely tolerable. Since I couldn't upload a video to Reddit, I tested it with a decibel meter (it's not a professional decibel meter, but it was the best way I could find to ""show"" the noise to you).

Pros and Cons:

Regarding the pros and cons, a direct and completely honest opinion: I could say that ""my ratio, for filter coffees, is 16 grams (1:15.6). If I needed to make two filter coffees at the same time, I wouldn't be able to, since the Fino's maximum capacity per grind is 25 grams,"" but I found it unfair to the grinder. I wouldn't make two filter coffees at the same time in practically any real-life situation. I have observations about the Nano, for example, but the Fino, in my opinion, has no negative points.

 I owned a C3 and a K4 and... Well, I'm very happy with the Fino and don't miss my old grinders at all. I also don't see myself replacing this grinder with another (remember: This is very personal. For me, it's perfect). It's beautiful, portable, has an excellent battery, virtually no retention, a good weight, the grind is uniform and consistent, its construction is incredible, and the only physical effort I need to exert is pressing a button.

That's it, folks. If I missed any details, feel free to ask me in the comments and I'll be happy to answer.

It's projected across four walls and the floor so you're properly immersed in it. Plus there's a free photography exhibition by their tour photographer Anna Lee showing 75 images from their record-breaking world tour. The photos spill out into King's Cross on outdoor benches, turning the area into a massive outdoor gallery. Timed with their ten Wembley shows.

Chapter 31: Parade Over the Kremlin.

12 Years After Arrival
May 2nd, Moscow, United Earth.
Twelve years had passed. The twelfth anniversary of the Swarm's arrival was celebrated worldwide as Unity Day, but the main festivities were held in Moscow. On the honorary tribune in Red Square, leaders who just a dozen years ago had been geopolitical rivals stood side by side. Presidents, prime ministers, chancellors—all the inhabitants of Earth who were left with symbolic authority over their nations, while the real reins of power were held by the UN Council and the Guard's command.
Anya Sharma, the Secretary-General, stood in their midst, feeling the cool spring wind on her face. But no one was looking at the politicians. All eyes, from those on the tribune, to those in the crowd filling the square, to the billions in front of screens around the world, were turned to the sky.
And in the sky, the fleet was sailing.
This was not the silent, ominous flyover of alien ships from years ago. This was a show of force. Loud, proud, and undeniable. Twenty-four ""Hammer"" class destroyers, gleaming in the sun like arrowheads, flew in a perfect, tight formation. They didn't roar like jet fighters. They moved with an unnatural grace, emitting only a low, chest-vibrating hum from their Higgs engines. They flew low, just a thousand meters above the colorful domes of the Kremlin, and their shadows swept across the crowd like the hands of giants.
""God, what a sight..."" Anya whispered, her voice a mixture of awe and fear.
The whole world cheered. From Tokyo to Buenos Aires, from Cape Town to Oslo, people poured into the streets to watch the broadcast. These were their ships. Their achievements. A symbol of what the human species could do when united in the face of a common goal. Pride swelled in the hearts of millions.
Sergeant Lena Kowalska watched the television screen on the metal wall, sipping her coffee, admiring the parade of destroyers over the Kremlin. She built similar ones. She smiled, though deep down she was not happy with her new assignment. She had completed and passed her fusion reactor training with the highest possible score. She had been urgently transferred to the Gagarin shipyard to replace a lieutenant who had an accident in which he lost his leg; there had been similar cases before, and the nanites needed about 2 months to regenerate it. She was to supervise the installation of the reactor along with other technicians and specialists from every corner of the Earth. The shipyard bearing Gagarin's name had not let her go, even though relations between Poles and Russians had been tense since the wars of 2053. She wanted to return to the Kopernik; she wrote requests and letters to her superiors, citing that part of her family had died in that war and that this created personal problems in her work with the Russians. But command refused her every time, replying with a simple sentence: ""Request denied. We are all in the Seven Worlds Defense Guard. Problems of a national and ethnic nature are not taken into account in the evaluation of a staff position."" Her direct superior, Lieutenant Commander Kovalenko, understood her completely. He himself came from Ukraine; his parents were children when the war of 2022 broke out, and his grandfather had died during it, just like hundreds of thousands of others. He supported her when she wrote her requests and official letters, signing his approval for her departure every time, but he could do nothing more. The higher command of the Gagarin shipyard was adamant; they could not afford to lose such a brilliant technician, thanks to whom the fusion reactor assembly schedules were completed ahead of time and without issues.
She turned away from the screen and gave an order to a junior technician. ""How's the temperature reading, Valeriy?"" He replied, ""Lena, everything's okay, we're not going to fall."" She glanced at the brass plate mounted on the reactor casing with the inscription ""Ivan's Heart.""
And then it appeared. The Guard's first cruiser, produced in a record time of two years. It was enormous, twice the size of the destroyers, which looked like its escort. Its silhouette was brutal, angular, designed for maximum firepower, not elegance. On its gray, armored hull, a proud, white name was written in Cyrillic: ""Ivan Grozny"" (Ivan the Terrible).
A name reflecting the character of most of its builders—Russian engineers and technicians from the ""Gagarin"" orbital shipyard, suspended in geostationary orbit over Siberia.
Admiral Marcus Thorne, standing next to Anya, watched the fleet's flyover not with pride, but with a cool, analytical satisfaction. Each ship was to him a collection of data, a test, an equation that had proven correct.
As the massive hull of the ""Ivan Grozny"" briefly eclipsed the sun, he sighed softly. ""We've mastered it,"" he muttered, more to himself than to Anya. ""We've mastered the technology of atmospheric flight with large vessels.""
Anya looked at him quizzically.
""Anti-gravity generators, my brother Aris's new toy, combined with local manipulation of the Higgs field,"" he explained briefly. ""We can make a twenty-thousand-ton cruiser as light as a feather. This changes everything. It means we can build them on the surface of planets. In gigantic, ground-based factories. Faster. Cheaper. And more of them.""
Anya Sharma understood. This parade was not just a display of what they had already built. It was a test by Marcus and Aris, and a promise of what they intended to build next. A fleet so vast that today's would look like a small, honorary escort in comparison.
Admiral Marcus Thorne watched as the last destroyer left the space above the square. His mission was to build a shield. But looking at these powerful, heavily armed silhouettes, he couldn't resist the thought that what they were creating much more closely resembled a sword. The biggest sword in their known part of the galaxy.

1n2jvff,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n2jvff/aitah_for_not_apologizing_to_my_brother_and/,AITAH for not apologizing to my brother and instead going no contact?,"I'm reposting this because I realize earlier I did not provide enough details. So here goes. And I will try to keep it as short as possible, but I apologize in advance for the lengthy post.

In January 2025 I (30F) shared a post on Facebook regarding the current issue with immigrants in the US. The post said something along the lines of ""no one is illegal on stolen land"" basically saying that most American citizens are immigrants since the land we live on was not ours to begin with (ours being white Americans of European descent). My brother (37M) laugh reacted to the post (he is MAGA). I commented on the post, tagging my brother, and stated ""If you do not have anything of value to add to the post, please keep your fucking emojis off my page."" He responded to my comment stating ""So you're okay with your son being around r\*pists, m\*rderers and t\*rrorists?"" insinuating that every immigrant in this country was one of those things. We got into an argument, commenting back and forth, before I got fed up and just deleted the post. I don't have any issue debating politics in a respectful way and I know that posting online opens the door for different opinions, but again, it can be discussed respectfully. I have a friend who is right-leaning and we often have healthy debates, though he isn't MAGA.

Anyways, the day this all happened we were to celebrate our mom's birthday at my brother's house, but a few hours after the Facebook argument he texted me stating that I ""publicly embarrassed him"" and I was no longer welcome in his home (and therefore would not be able to celebrate my mom's birthday).

For the next several months, my brother was apparently waiting for an apology from me for my initial comment about keeping the emojis off my page. He told my mom that ""if she apologizes, she can come over this weekend and all is well"" but I opted not to because I felt like he intentionally laugh-reacted to the post knowing it would set me off. He is very familiar with my political stance and I felt like he was trying to get under my skin. I also felt that if I apologized, nothing would change and he'd go back to the same antagonistic behaviors believing he was right and I was wrong.

Another few months go by and I realized that I had been holding a lot of resentment toward my brother for things that have occurred over the last ten or so years and that may be why I reacted so harshly. My brother can be very self-centered and shows love through money, yet anytime he has bought something for me or helped me financially he has held it over my head. *Example* ""How can you say I don't treat you well when I paid for your cat's surgery."" My male cat had a urinary blockage and likely would've been put down if he didn't have the surgery and I didn't have the money. My brother graciously paid for it, but has since held it over my head numerous times which makes me feel like it wasn't done out of the kindness of his heart. There were other situations like this as well as times I felt that my feelings were ignored or pushed aside in the past, so I decided to type up a letter explaining why I felt resentful, how he's hurt my feelings in certain situations and how we suck at having open communication with each other. I took accountability for my own faults in the letter and even stated that I realized my initial comment on Facebook came off harsh, but I did also ask that he take accountability for his actions/words as well and asked if we sit down and talk things out.

A few weeks later (in May) his wife (35F) asked me to meet to talk. I was frustrated and a bit upset that he hadn't reached out, but agreed. We met up at a coffee shop one Saturday and I thought she wanted to hash things out so we could all move forward. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case at all. It was a verbal assault of her telling me everything she's wanted to say to me since the initial incident, defending my brother because he's a ""hardworking man and a great husband/dad"" as if that excuses him treating people like sh\*t and belittling my feelings. She also informed me that he refused to read my letter and instead asked her to read it. She told me she isn't sure if he'll ever read it. She stated ""it's not that he doesn't care about you, it's that he doesn't care about the drama."" She also stated that she felt as if I invited them to my son's (2M) birthday party the following month because ""I had to"" and not because I wanted to. I calmly explained to them that is my child and I wouldn't ask them to be there if I didn't want them around him. Only close friends and family would be attending. She stated they felt awkward going because everyone would know what happened and they'd feel uncomfortable. This came as a shock because I hadn't told ANYONE what happened and I'd only talked about it with my mom who was directly involved from the start. This was basically an admission that they'd gone around to their family and friends talking sh\*t about me since she was assuming I'd done the same. She also brought up multiple issues they had with me that were never voiced to me such as me not speaking to her family enough at holidays/events (for context I'm extremely shy and have GAD so I get very nervous in social settings especially around people I don't know well) and also that I didn't bring food over for holidays (when I was never asked) and I apologized and asked why they hadn't talked to me about this prior to this conversation and she didn't really have a solid answer for that, just that they didn't know how to talk to me about it or how I'd react.

After not speaking to my brother since January and this conversation with SIL going horribly, I decided to fully go no contact IF they ended up not coming to my son's birthday party - that would be my last straw. Days before the party she texted a simple ""we won't be able to make it to the party"" and I haven't spoken to her since.

However, now things with my family are strained because we also have a younger brother (28M) and share the same mom, so family get-togethers are awkward or one of us doesn't attend at all. It's breaking my mom's heart, but I can't stand the person my brother is and if we weren't related I don't think I'd want anything to do with him. It does suck because he has a son (3M), my nephew, who I adore and miss terribly. And while my son doesn't remember them much (he was 18 months old last time we saw them), my nephew remembers my son and asks for him often.

So all this to say, AITAH for not apologizing for my Facebook comment? Should I suck it up and apologize now or is it not even worth it? Was I in the wrong here?

**Side note:** My mom watches my son during the day while I work M-F 8-5 and has asked if she could get together with SIL who is a SAHM and my nephew for play dates, but I'm apprehensive. I don't like that SIL would see my son whenever she can without me present, but I won't ever see my nephew (and haven't since December 2024). If I am no contact with my brother and SIL than I feel my son should be as well. But it's hard because my mom is still in contact with them and she watches my son.

I hope that's enough details for you to lend some advice, but I'm happy to provide more or answer questions if needed.",3,1756404984.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False
1n2jvdw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n2jvdw,DēLonghi Dinamica Plus Connected - 16 Month Review,"I purchased this product straight from DēLonghi about 16 months ago, on sale for $1,299. I found a 10% off coupon, which brought the price to about $1,160 before taxes.

This was my first super automatic but I typically do a good amount of product research before making an expensive purchase. I could not find a ton of info on this specific model, so I’m posting here to say this one is very solid. 

Before this model I had a DēLonghi that had the drip carafe on one side, and a manual espresso tamper other. It made very nice espresso and drip coffee, but I like to entertain, and making 5 family members espresso drinks during the holidays got me looking at upgrades.

I like to find value where I can, and this machine popped up as on sale, and a 10% off coupon I found online worked on top of the sale price. That said, pretty much everyone was nudging me to go Jura at the time. We had an E8 at my last office and it was a beast. Outside of that, I mostly used a Chemex before getting my machine.

I wouldn’t call myself a “coffee snob”, but also don’t see the point in drinking shitty coffee every morning. Once tuned in, this machine just pumps out delicious and consistent espresso all day long. Probably half of all the drinks I make, I just use the espresso. 10/10 on the espresso front.

The milk drinks are a little more complicated and harder to tune in, but once you find the balance and ratio, the milk drinks function is no hassle and produces consistent results. The cleanup and prep is on par with basically every unit in this price range, and some that cost more than double what I paid. The milk will make the drinks less than “piping hot”, and I like my coffee “piping hot”, so I’ll only use it when I am in the mood and ready to drink immediately. I started using the 1883 syrups and I like most of their seemingly infinite options. I threw the Torani and Monin ones I had bought in the trash.

Maintenance is easy. I use only filtered water and descale once every 3 months, and swap out the filter when I do. The milk carafe for the milk drinks needs to be cleaned every 2-3 days if you’re storing milk in it. I open up the side door and rinse the unit once a month. 

Cons: milk isn’t super hot, but I had the same issue on the Jura which was more than double the price. I wish the water tank was larger, it seems like I’m perpetually filling it up. The app is ass. I don’t even know why I need the app, but if you’re someone who thinks they’ll use it, be prepared for it to suck. It was great in theory, poor in execution.

Pros: VALUE - I have compared my little machine to so many others in the last 16 months. At this price point, I feel like I did very well. The machine is consistent, which makes dialing everything in super easy. Variety is also super nice for this price. It makes like 16 different milk drinks. The Eletta Explore has double the milk menu, but is also more expensive. 

Overall, I just love this little machine. If your budget is right here in that $1,250 range, this is a solid option. My coffee drink counter is at 2650 coffee drinks, 810 with milk drinks, and 550 liters of water processed.

I normally brew a full 1.25L pot, use Aldi Peruvian beans on weekdays, and get beans from a local roaster on weekends.

Right now, I have the Oxo conical burr grinder ([https://www.oxo.com/conical-burr-coffee-grinder.html](https://www.oxo.com/conical-burr-coffee-grinder.html), $100). I've dialed in the setting (12, FWIW) and the coffee is just ok. It looks and tastes like there are a lot of fine particles no matter what setting I use. I'm hoping that a better grinder would produce more uniform grounds and make for a better brew.

I found this post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1ic2jkz/should\_i\_upgrade\_oxo\_grinder/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1ic2jkz/should_i_upgrade_oxo_grinder/)), but none of the comments mention the Opus.

There are several other posts that mention the Opus grinder, but I'm wondering if anyone here has moved from the Oxo to the Opus. Is the coffee better? Do you feel the more-expensive Opus was worth the price?

I know that the Fellow Ode / Ode 2 is popular here. My reasoning to go with the Opus over the Ode 2: possibility of using for espresso, easier-to-digest price.
