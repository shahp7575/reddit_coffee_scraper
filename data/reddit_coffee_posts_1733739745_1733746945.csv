1ha8fft,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceHeaters101/comments/1ha8fft/my_chaotic_but_warm_adventure_qqt_electric_space/,My Chaotic but Warm Adventure - QQT Electric Space Heater Review,"Let‚Äôs talk about warmth. Or rather, those lackluster attempts at achieving it in my drafty apartment. Enter the savior of the season: the QQT XH-1201 Electric Space Heater \[[check the price here](https://heatad.com/product-reviews/efficient-comfort-qqt-xh-1201-electric-space-heater-review-b0bgspp7s1/)\] . I snagged one to tame this Arctic lair of mine, and boy, have we had some adventures together.



Let‚Äôs rewind a bit. Picture my apartment: as cozy as a bear den in summer until that bear forgot to pay the heating bill. This little heater promised to transform my icy habitat into a Cancun-esque oasis. Also promised were fancy perks like safety switches and a compact design‚Äîperfect for someone with an affinity for tripping over cords (guilty as charged).



Now, fast forward to the unboxing: a cute, unassuming widget that could barely scare a mouse. But like the underdog in every feel-good movie, this little heater packed a punch. I set it up, immediately cranked it to full blast, and waited for tropical winds to blow through my living room. Spoiler: It did get warm. Impressive for something I once mistook for a lunchbox.



However, every lovable character has quirks, and the QQT is no different. It hums like it's practicing for a karaoke night, a detail that Mr. Whiskers (my ever-skeptical cat) finds utterly suspicious. He has started watching it like a hawk, which makes for some unintentional comedic moments.



And boy, oh boy, talk about quirky shutdowns. I was testing its trip protection when, during one lazy, nap-induced stupor, it clicked off automatically. Golden star for safety! Though I wonder if my cousin might attempt to tip it over again, this time deliberately‚Äîhis contribution to our family gatherings being questionable at best.



Here's the buzzkill ‚Äì while I've so far escaped a monstrous electric bill, my ears haven't escaped this device's constant whir. It‚Äôs like having a tiny airplane taking off repeatedly beside your ear, which I find endearing but might remind others of a busy coffee shop or busy thoughts.



Before you dash to rearrange your living spaces for its arrival, here are a few need-to-knows. It's not the best for large rooms, so don't expect it to be the North Star of your entire home. And you‚Äôll need to personally cater to it, given the glaring absence of a remote control. Hello, step count.



Despite fielding several challenges like the cord being shorter than an impulsive haircut and covering limited ground, this heater has snuggled its way into my heart. It‚Äôs been my winter‚Äôs door to warmth, adding that perfect blanket level of comfort to my oft-neglected study nook.



So there it is, my QQT tale. We‚Äôve been through pet dramas, cousin antics, and staying warm despite hellacious drafts. It might not have bells, whistles, or remote control symphonies, but it's caught a spot in my small-space living world. It's like an old sweater‚Äîyou know there are newer, fancier things out there, but you wouldn‚Äôt trade it for them.



In the end, though the cheese grater hum of my QQT won‚Äôt score any awards for the best white noise, it scores all the possible warmth points for chilly souls like mine and patient cats like Mr. Whiskers everywhere.",1,1733746675.0,SpaceHeaters101,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve had my VertuoPlus Deluxe for about three years now, and I love it. I wasn‚Äôt much of a coffee drinker before, but this machine completely changed that for me.

Last month, I started getting the steady half green/half red light, which meant it needed descaling and refused to brew. No problem‚ÄîI descaled it and ran multiple rinses just to be thorough.

Now, the machine is showing a steady green light when it‚Äôs ready to brew, but as soon as I press the cup button, it flashes red twice, then goes back to steady green. It won‚Äôt brew at all.

I‚Äôve called Nespresso customer service so many times I‚Äôve lost count. They‚Äôve walked me through rinsing, manual cleaning, factory resets‚Äîyou name it. Nothing has fixed the issue.

At this point, I‚Äôm exhausted just trying to make a cup of coffee. I know I could buy a new machine, but with the holidays here, I‚Äôd really like to save the money if I can.

Has anyone experienced this issue? Were you able to fix it? Or is it time to give up and start fresh with a new machine?

I'm hoping to make some friends who, like me, work unsociable hours and find it a bit of a challenge on their days off to socialise. I work a four day week, though the days are long and include both Friday and Saturday. My main days off are Wednesday and Thursday and it's difficult to see my friends during the day as they work a usual 9-5 schedule. Whilst it's always lovely to see them in the evenings, I'm finding that during the day I am stuck in a bit of a rut.

I have hobbies and do get out and about on these days, but usually on my own. I spend lots of time out on walks or sitting in a coffee shop with whatever book I'm reading. I do love spending time on my own, but it has hit me recently that I'm doing the same things over and over each week and it's starting to become quite draining. I'm always on the lookout for new things to do as a means of combatting this, but this is where I feel making more friends would be helpful.

It'd be lovely to hear from anyone else who finds themselves in this situation. Whether your days off are also Wednesday and Thursday, or perhaps they are slightly different but you'd like to piggyback off this post then please speak up!

A bit about me - I'm 25M, live in Burley, and work for a bank. I spend most of my time in and around Headingley/Meanwood/Horsforth. I absolutely love Meanwood Park, going for walks, hopping on a train somewhere to explore a new place, dropping into the various independent shops and coffee places on offer, visiting markets and fairs, going to community events and workshops etc..!

[CycPlus AS2 Pro inflator](https://www.cycplus.com/products/tiny-e-pump-for-bike-as2-pro) \- about the size of a small tube and less faffing around than a handpump. I still carry a backup CO2, but this is perfect for top-ups on rides close to home.

[KOM Cycling tubeless plug kit](https://komcycling.com/products/tubeless-tire-repair-tool) \- I don't get a lot of flats, but this has saved a few rides and it's reassuring having enough plugs to cover a group ride. Way cheaper than a Dynaplug.

[Ornot Micro Climate jacket](https://www.ornotbike.com/collections/micro-climate-jackets) \- stretchy, breathable, 2-way zip, rolls up tiny. Not much help with rain, but fantastic for variable temps. So light I've forgotten I have a jacket on.

[Defeet lightweight merino socks](https://defeet.com/collections/wool-cycling-socks/products/wooleator-pro-6-d-logo) \- surprisingly comfortable even in hot weather, my new 3-season go-to.

[Lantiseptic Skin Protectant](https://dermarite.com/product/lantiseptic-original-skin-protectant/) \- has replaced chamois cream for me on the longest rides. The nuclear option for my undercarriage. Too bad it smells like a hospital.

[Silca drip wax](https://silca.cc/products/silca-super-secret-chain-lube) \- for my bike's undercarriage. I can't be bothered with immersion waxing, but this keeps things happy in dry conditions. Smoove has been a solid backup option.

[Epic Ride Weather for iOS](https://www.epicrideweather.com/) \- I feel like I'm dressing wrong for every ride, but at least I know what I'm riding into.

[RideWithGPS](https://ridewithgps.com/) \- hands down my favorite route-building and discovery tool. My first stop when riding somewhere unfamiliar and I can spend hours perfecting my routes near home. The paid version has earned its keep many times over.

1ha82z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ha82z4/set_it_and_forget_it_a_review_of_the_ceado_hoop/,Set it and forget it: A review of the Ceado Hoop brewer,"I've came across the Ceado Hoop brewer I think early this year or late last year (can't remember the exact date) but it was definitely a relatively new product. Not a lot of reviews/testimonials, even from this sub about how good or bad the brewer is or how it performs. When I had the chance to snag one, I ended up purchasing it. I am making this post after owning (and brewing a lot of coffee) the Hoop for almost 2 months now.

For anyone not familiar with what the Ceado Hoop brewer is, you can check their [official website](https://coffee.ceado.com/en/products/86-hoop_coffee_brewer/56-hoop). They call it a 'radial infusion brewer' which to be honest, is just a really fancy way of saying a no-bypass brewer with less steps lol. Water filters evenly through the coffee bed, in a smooth and very regulated way thanks to the side holes at the bottom of the chamber/tower.

I am making this post in the hopes that any person interested to know more about this brewer would have more key insights regarding it.

I am summarizing this post with basically some key points that I have noticed after using the Hoop for quite some time now:

1. The Hoop produces a very, very, very **consistent cup of coffee:** the flavor profile is a very sweet and whole bodied coffee experience. To me, it consistently produces a good cup of coffee, but not a great cup.
2. The drawdown time is very slow, much slower than an Aeropress. No matter how fast you pour or how coarse you grind, the drawdown time usually lasts at the very minimum, 4 minutes. Longest drawdown time for me was around 8ish minutes when I tried to grind fine. (I would assume this is because the coffee is not immersed in water like with the Aeropress; it is merely dispersed at an even rate to the coffee bed)
3. I want to declare that I am no food scientist/nutritionist/researcher, but I do have a refractometer at home. I have played around with a bunch of methods on how to brew with the Hoop (bloom, stirring the bed, water temperature, grind size, etc.) but the extraction yield was almost always the same. The taste was also almost always the same. It's actually crazy that despite adjusting a lot of the variables, the the extraction yield percentage and taste were just very marginally different. Talk about consistency? lol
4. Since it takes a long time to brew, you usually lose a lot of heat once the brewing process is finished. You might want to always use boiling water here if you do not have the Hoop cover (which is another expensive add on). Thermal retention is bad
5. The Aeropress filters fit the Hoop perfectly. I believe Hoop also sells their own proprietary filters, and it is thinner, but if you have a ton of Aeropress filters lying around, you can also use them here.

Who is the Ceado Hoop brewer for?

* People who want to make a good cup of coffee that is very easy to learn, very easy to make, and very easy to replicate.
* People who need coffee before coffee; people who just want a ""set it and forget it"" type of brewer like an automatic drip machine where you just set it and come back for it later.
* Owners of the Aeropress (with a ton of paper filters lying around) that are struggling with producing a cup of coffee that they like from the Aeropress.

Who is the Ceado Hoop brewer NOT for?

* If you want the flexibility of being able to adjust and dial the overall cup experience to your liking, this brewer is not for you. Trust me, I have tried my best to tweak it to different extremes, it still produced a very similar taste experience
* If you want a quick cup to make. This thing takes some time to brew, and by time, I mean north of 4-5 mins usually
* If you have the Aeropress, already like the coffee it produces, and don't really mind the versatility it has",8,1733745396.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Over text was okay but after we set the date he stopped responding until the day before it. We went to a breakfast place but he said he had breakfast before showing up. The vibe was super awkward but I tried to make the best of it since he may have been nervous. 

I talked for a good portion of time and he seemed super zoned out and wasn‚Äôt engaging with the conversation at all. I tried to ask him if he had any topics he wanted to talk about but he said no. He looked really bored at one point so I asked point blank if he was bored. He said he wasn‚Äôt bored and that it‚Äôs just his ADHD. He said that it was hard to focus because of it. 

Does ADHD make it that hard to focus when you‚Äôre on a date? If that‚Äôs true, can you have a normal conversation with ADHD and not seem spaced out or distracted? I want to be considerate of people‚Äôs issues but I felt really disrespected by the glazed over look and little engagement.

His financial success is the result of a combination of strategic real estate ventures, a prominent online presence, and various entrepreneurial pursuits.

# How Graham Stephan Made His Money

# 1. Real Estate Ventures

# 3. Online Courses

To extend his reach, Graham created online courses like ""The Real Estate Agent Academy"" and ""YouTube Creator Academy.""

1ha7tfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindOrbit/comments/1ha7tfg/10_life_hacks_every_university_student_should_know/,10 Life Hacks Every University Student Should Know,"# Cheap food hacks:

Food and drink purchases can add up and make your budget go awry. Some distractions and temptations sound fun but expensive, like going out with friends, meeting classmates for coffee, or having a drink or dinner.

To avoid the stress of going over your budget, you will need to plan meals at the dorm. Get an electric kettle or coffee maker, or use the one on the campus. Fill your kettle halfway with milk and chocolate chips. Brew two cups of water, stir and have hot chocolate ready to sip.

Fill the kettle with water, bring it to a boil, add the sausages and let cook for five minutes. Another quick meal is filling the reservoir with water, putting the dried noodles in, and letting them brew. Empty the flavoring packet afterward and stir well.

You can have inexpensive and hassle-free meals in mere minutes with these helpful hacks.

# Make the most of your wardrobe space:

If you struggle every morning dressing up for university and wasting time, this hack will change your life. Collect the tabs of cold drink cans and use them to double or triple the¬†hangers in your wardrobe¬†without spending any money on a new wardrobe or a chest of drawers.

You can hang as many clothes as you want with the aid of can tabs. However, you can store your jeans and tees vertically in the drawers. Lastly, remember to keep away laundry when you wash to avoid piling up clothes, making mornings difficult.

# Manage time smartly:

As a university student, one of the most crucial tips one can get is how to manage time effectively. The number of deadlines pressing upon students can get overwhelming and stressful.

Writing a dissertation is not a piece of cake, especially if you don‚Äôt have enough time. Make a schedule, especially for sleeping and studying time. Following a proper routine will make your university years go smoothly.

# Stay within budget:

A fundamental and most crucial part of student life is to stay within budget. Learning to stay within budget until the end of the month takes a few trials and tribulations. To maintain a balance between social and¬†student life, you can download a budget calculator and stick to it.

Make a list of all your expenses, weekly and monthly. You will come up with the required final amount needed to get through the month. You can keep yourself in check and balance through the app to don‚Äôt exceed your expenses.

# Keep a planner:

Student life tends to get immensely busy. You lose track of deadlines, payments, bills and other commitments with so much already on your mind. To stay on top of things, download a planner app and type down everything you need to get done for the day. It will let you plan your day-to-day tasks according to your classes, deadlines and assignments.

Not only will you get your tasks and homework done, but the satisfaction of ticking off a chore will make you feel happy.

# Invest in me-time:

Keeping up with studies and extracurricular activities can take a toll on students as it can get overwhelming and exhausting. Remember to take out a little time now and then to enjoy me-time. Take yourself out to dinner, for a movie or just laze in front of the TV, if that‚Äôs what you like to do.

Eat healthily, keep yourself hydrated, exercise, get enough sleep and remember to take a breather whenever you feel swamped.

# Get the loudest alarm clock:

One of the widespread problems students face is sleeping through their alarms, missing lectures and workshops, and failing to pass exams. If you are a heavy sleeper, investing in a good-quality loud alarm will work. If you are tight on a budget, here is an incredible hack for you that works wonders.

Put your phone in a glass cup, and you will wake up to your alarm. The sound will be louder than usual, and you will need more time to turn it off. You will probably have to get off your bed to do so.

# Maintain a schedule:

An excellent homework hack is making a timetable or scheduling the tasks for the day. To avoid flunking, make a study plan to let you learn and complete all your syllabus on time and with excellent efficiency. It‚Äôs a fool-proof student life hack to learn better, achieve good grades and perform better.

The key to successful university life where you enjoy and learn is consistency. Struggling with time will mean you either miss out on academic responsibilities, social life or sleep. To avoid a messy lifestyle, lists are a great way to lifehack your time.

# Rent a student storage:

A dorm room doesn‚Äôt have enough space to store all your belongings, and if you have to share the room with someone else, it gets more challenging.¬†**Student Storage**¬†Reading by YouStock has some fantastic promotions to make students‚Äô lives easier.

Student Storage Bristol and Cardiff Student Storage have your holidays sorted. You don‚Äôt have to worry about paying rent for your dorm room when away. Renting a storage unit is much cheaper and safer. All your items are stored in purpose-built storage facilities with 24/7 CCTV and dual security locks on all doors.

# Highlight your notes and use coloured pens:

This might sound silly and childish, but having organised and neat notes is a real game-changer. Using different coloured pens and highlights can help you study faster. It‚Äôs also going to boost your learning capabilities.

Lectures and notes written or typed down with different colours are more accessible to navigate and find needed information.",1,1733744362.0,MindOrbit,0,1.0,False

Nutritionist Shikha Singh explains how this diet works by reducing inflammation caused by unhealthy habits like consuming processed food, sugar, and alcohol, as well as stress, poor sleep, and hormonal imbalances. These factors lead to fat storage and weight gain.

To shed kilos effectively, follow this anti-inflammatory diet plan:  
- Start your day with turmeric tea and 2 soaked walnuts.  
- Breakfast includes multigrain millet roti with green vegetables and green tea.  
- For mid-morning snacks, have one apple or orange.  
- Lunch should be moong dal salad with plenty of vegetables.  
- Evening snacks consist of black coffee with roasted chana.  
- Dinner includes tomato soup with 50 gm low-fat paneer or tofu.  
- End your day with Ajwain tea.  

Remember, adopting a healthier lifestyle is essential to reducing inflammation and achieving weight loss goals.

90% of posts are about the following -

-Restautant recommendations

-Cafe recommendations

-Gym recommendations

-meet ups (which never happen, and even if they do, it was the most bored I've ever been sitting in a caf√©)

The options for those are limited and will be the same for a good part of half a year, a few places always come up, but we choose to give them attention when they open and ignore them entirely after a month and then go back to asking for ""cafes to go to"" all over again pretty much on a daily basis.

The popular cafes or whatever have this fake over friendly service which feels really forced or feels like they have been ordered by their HR or bosses to go do it. I get that you have to interact, but PLEASE. It comes across as unnatural,  and also later you see the floor manager  going back behind the coffee maker and glare or roll their eyes at you. Nahin karna hain to mat karo, I personally don't care about being treated like the only man in the world when I walk into a cafe, but your rudeness will force me to tell everyone at my work and visiting delegates to absolutely avoid the cafes.

I wanted to share my experience with coffee and see if it resonates with anyone else here.

I'm highly sensitive to coffee - even just 1-2 sips of a caffeinated coffee immediately make me feel incredibly energized, social, and upbeat. It's not just a mild boost; it completely shifts how I interact with people. I become more talkative, quick-witted, and confident in conversations, even with strangers - something I usually find difficult without coffee.

What‚Äôs interesting is that this happens even with decaffeinated coffee, though the effect is slightly less intense. It's as though coffee flips a switch in my brain that makes socializing feel effortless and enjoyable. I don't experience anxiety or negative thoughts during this time, which is surprising given my generally stoic personality.

Without coffee, I often struggle in social situations, especially with unfamiliar people, and I feel much more hesitant or ""stuck"" in conversations.

Does anyone else experience this kind of dramatic shift after drinking coffee?

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts or if anyone has had a similar experience!

**Devotional Title: The Call to Evangelism in Every Heart**

**Scripture Reading:**  
Matthew 28:19-20 (NIV) ‚Äì ‚ÄúTherefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.‚Äù

**Reflection:**  
Each one of us carries a divine spark within‚Äîa calling that pulses with the heartbeat of Christ‚Äôs mission. In every heart, there lies a beautiful invitation to share the hope and love we have received. The command to ‚Äúgo and share‚Äù is not a burden; it is a blessing that enriches our lives and those around us.

Think about how significant your story is. The moments when you have felt lost, the times you have discovered grace, and the ways you have experienced God‚Äôs faithfulness‚Äîall of these are powerful testimonies waiting to be shared. Each interaction, conversation, and encounter is an opportunity to reflect the light of Christ.

Imagine a candle in a dark room. Alone, it casts a warm glow, but when the light spreads, it illuminates the entire space. You, too, are that light. When you share the love of Jesus, you become a beacon of hope, guiding others out of darkness and into His marvelous light.

**Encouragement:**  
You may wonder if you have what it takes to evangelize. You might feel inadequate or fear rejection. But remember, Jesus did not call the qualified; He qualifies the called. His grace equips you to share not only words but also the transformative power of your life testimony.

Take heart! The Holy Spirit empowers you. You are never alone in this mission. Jesus promised, ‚ÄúI am with you always.‚Äù With each step of faith, He is right beside you, offering courage, wisdom, and the gentle nudging to act.

Share your story with joy, whether it‚Äôs in a coffee shop, on the soccer field, or in the hustle and bustle of daily life. Speak of His goodness and the peace He has brought you. Invite others to experience the grace that has changed everything for you.

**Prayer:**  
Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of Your love and the calling on my life to share that love with others. Help me to be bold and courageous as I step into opportunities to share my faith. Fill me with Your Spirit, and guide my words and actions. May I always reflect Your light and truth. I trust that You will be with me in every conversation. Help me to see the people around me through Your eyes, recognizing the divine appointments You have prepared. In Jesus‚Äô name, amen.

**Contemplation:**  
Take a moment today to reflect on who God is placing in your heart to reach out to. Pray for the courage to connect, share, and invite them to know Jesus.

As you go about your day, remember: your voice matters, your story matters, and your willingness to share can change a life forever. Be encouraged‚Äîyour heart is called to evangelism, and the world is waiting to hear your light. Go and share, beloved friend, for the harvest is plentiful!

1ha7guj,https://www.reddit.com/r/KnowledgeCrafters/comments/1ha7guj/here_are_25_hacks_that_will_save_you_time_money/,"Here are 25 Hacks that will save you time, money and really get things done without breaking into a sweat.
","1) Have a bunch of notebooks that all look the same? Colour the page ends of each book with a different coloured sketch pen. This will help you easily recognize the different subject books in your bag or on the shelf and will also bring a great pop of colour to your study space! 

2) The key to combatting smelly shoes is‚Ä¶ tea bags! After playing your favourite sport or walking all day, the best (and most eco-friendly) way to fix your smelly shoes is to take two tea bags and put them in your shoes before you put your shoes away. You can also put small bags of potpourri or a handful of aromatic flowers and spices. Your bag, locker, or shoe cabinet will never reek again! This is one of the best¬†**Life Hacks For School Students**.

3) Making presentations can be nerve-racking especially if it counts to your final score. If you are using notecards while presenting, use a different coloured pen for each point or line. This will help you remember your points better and read with ease, without fumbling, thus, allowing you to seamlessly transition from one point to another.

4) Math can be fun! For students who want to revise their tables and other math operations, all you need are a few Styrofoam cups! Check out this handy GIF:

5) Lost your eraser again? Try using a small piece of bread as an eraser. Back before erasers were invented, people used bread as an eraser! If you haven‚Äôt got any bread, find a rubber band and tie that at the end of your pencil to use as an eraser. Or, if your eraser is attached to the end of your pencil, and it‚Äôs ‚Äúover‚Äù, you can sharpen the end and it will reveal some more of the eraser!

6) Take notes using different coloured pens. Not only will it nicely organise your notes and make them look attractive, it will also help you recall the content easily. However, if you‚Äôre not into coloured pens and prefer writing in one colour only, studies show that notes in blue ink are easier to remember than those in black ink! This is one of the best¬†**Life Hacks For School Students**.

7) Use ‚Äòscholar.google.com‚Äô for essays or research instead of google.com. You‚Äôll find more reliable and relevant resources there other than general blogs from people.

8) Drawing tables and diagrams in your notes increase the mind‚Äôs recall capacity!

9) Keep some mint handy in your pencil case. It helps to reduce headaches and boost your concentration! This is one the best¬†**Life Hacks For School Students**.

10) Use a dry erase marker at home without a whiteboard! Mirrors, frames, glass, are all perfect substitutes for a whiteboard and you can use such surfaces to note down quick to-dos, last minute formulas, and so on! To remove the marks, just use a cloth or a piece of damp paper!

11) If you‚Äôre feeling low and just want to curl up into a ball and take a nap, write some positive affirmations to motivate yourself! Use colourful pens and be as creative as you want...it will really lift up your spirits and drive you through the rest of the day. This is one of the best¬†**Life Hacks For School Students**.

12) When starting a new notebook, leave the first few pages blank. You can then create a handy table of contents to find notes easily during exam time!

13) After writing your essay, copy-paste it onto Google translate and listen to it. Listening makes it easier to find mistakes. This is one of the best¬†**Life Hacks For School Students.**

14) Stick some post-it notes in an empty tray or chalkboard and use that as a great to-do list organiser! When you‚Äôre done with the tasks, simply discard the paper. You can also take one off when you need it and stick it anywhere!

15) Keep all your stationery organised and in one place using this fun D.I.Y. Take a few old plastic jars and glue them together as shown in the picture. Once the glue dries, fill them all up with stationery! This is one of the best¬†**Life Hacks For School Students.**

16) Keepmeout is a great website and app that helps you beat distractions! If you‚Äôre working on the desktop, this website will keep you out of sites such as facebook.com, youtube.com, etc. And on the phone, this app will lock your phone for any number of minutes specified!

17) You can also use the ‚Äúflight mode‚Äù on your phone to beat distractions or just restart your phone in ‚Äúsafe mode‚Äù.

18) If your pen is not working because the ink is dry, you can try putting some heat on it using a hand dryer or a hair dryer! Pretty soon, your pen will work as good as new!

19) A friend asks for a pencil but you only have one? Break your pencil into two and sharpen the other one!

20) Every second counts when you‚Äôre getting ready for school. Make a playlist of upbeat songs that take exactly the same amount of time as you do to get ready and leave the house for school! Pretty soon, your morning schedule will work according to specific songs and you will know when you‚Äôre running a little late! Getting ready for school just got more enjoyable, don‚Äôt you think? This is one of the best¬†**Life Hacks For School Students**.

21) If you have highlighted something by mistake or simply want to remove some highlighted text from your book, simply take a Q-tip and soak the bud with lime juice. Then, swipe the bud over the highlighted text. This hack really works like magic - no highlight and the text stays perfectly intact!

22) If you want to remember the digits of pi, just memorise the sentence ‚Äì ‚ÄúMay I have a large container of coffee?‚Äù Count the number of alphabets in each word, and you have it ‚Äì 3.1415926!

23) Always getting confused between ‚Äúaffect‚Äù and ‚Äúeffect‚Äù? Here‚Äôs a trick to remember ‚Äì ‚ÄúAffect‚Äù is an Action. Both the words start with an A. Hence, affect is a verb. ‚ÄúEffect‚Äù is a thing. Hence, effect is a noun. If you can‚Äôt remember this, just use the word ‚Äúimpact‚Äù and you will never go wrong!

24) Had enough sleep but still feeling super tired when you wake up? You‚Äôre just dehydrated, drink a glass of water!

25) Need to draw a circle but don‚Äôt have a compass? Just take two pencils and tie them with a string. Use one pencil as the centre of the circle and the other to draw. Alternatively, you can use some paperclips as shown below!",1,1733742940.0,KnowledgeCrafters,0,1.0,False

I need out of the box ideas.,"I don't think my story is particularly unusual here, but I'm getting to the point where my life is basically living with migraines all the time. I really, desperately need some ideas.

Since about 2 years ago, my migraines have gotten progressively worse. I always had occasional flair-ups, but now, I basically have a migraine every single day, or at least, I'm in postdrome phase most of the time. Triptans work, but increasingly slowly. Diclofenac also seems to work, especially in combination with triptans. I've had to go to the hospital once with a truly terrible migraine about a year ago, where I couldn't even see light before recoiling.

During a migraine, I have light and sound sensitivity. I don't vomit. No aura. The only prodrome I have is a suddenly, inexplicable nausea, but never very intense. I might see flashes of light sometimes? I occasionally get ""spikes"" of pain on the sides of my head during a few seconds/minutes, but then they go away. I never tried to relate those with migraines, but since I get migraines all the time, it's kinda hard to make any correlation work.

Pretty much all preventatives I've tried did nothing. I've tried (deep breath):
* Anti-depressants like Amitriptyline, Mirtazapine, Venlafaxine
* Topiramate
* Valproate
* Flunarizine
* Propanolol
* Candesartan
* CGRP-related treatments like Fremanezumab and Rimegapant. Lots of money sunk here and 0 response.
* Magnesium

Botox *seems* to work somewhat, but it's quite expensive. Nerve blocking for treatment-resistent migraines does nothing. Cortisol does nothing either.

My eyes are fine. I might have a slight sinusitis, and sinus flushing seems to aliviate some of the constant background pain. I did CAT scans multiple times; my head is perfectly fine. I also did blood tests, also nothing unusual.

I apparently have no triggers, or if I do, they are constant. I've tried to cut foods like gluten, fats, milk, coffee, added sugar. I don't drink. I've tried eating at regular hours and I go to sleep about the same hour every day. I've tried vitamin supplements, but that also did nothing. I think I eat relatively healtily (mediterranean diet, I cook for myself).

I can't use normal computer screens before getting nausea, even when I don't have acute pain. E-paper screens are fine (which is where I'm writing this now). I'm currently trying to finish my PhD and I can't work most days because I'm either in pain or I'm too afraid to use a computer.

So yeah, I need some ideas, because as things stand, I'm not going to be able to even work, much less do the things I like. Pretty miserable future right here. Anything I can try to do to figure out my triggers, or a preventative that might work, if getting a second opinion is worth it, etc. I'm going to the neurologist this Wednesday, so it's a good oportunity to bring stuff up with her. Thanks in advance!

P.S.: I'm also male, so female-specific ideas will obviously not work on me.",3,1733742665.0,migraine,8,1.0,False

One of the questions is precisely how to recycle the IPA. I'm making a filtration system alternating between containers exposed to UV light and coffee filters. Finally, I pass it through a 0.5 micron ceramic filter that I bought on Amazon. 

It's worked well so far, but the last few times I filtered it, the alcohol comes out cloudy (it also seems to have less of a smell, or maybe I'm just used to it). It seems to work well, but I wonder about the effectiveness of this filtered alcohol.

I tend to have my Wacom in front of the keyboard because I use blender a loooot, but I use the Mac for other things too kind of like every other person on the planet. And then it totally effs up everything I try to do. It randomly locks my computer into some weird ""feature"" that probably no human outside apple has ever seen before, like yesterday, I had to reboot because it was stuck in a magnified unexitable unforcequittable small framed zone?? Ive worked in concept design and video gaming 20+ years and never seen or heard of that haha. Random shortcuts changes language and other surprises happens as I move my arms across the Wacom and keyboard at the same time. It's just silly. This was never an issue before I recently got a new M4 idk maybe I set it up with luck and a lot of divine interventions when I last did it 7 years ago its too long ago to remember what exact process I did. So now i disabled all the hw buttons and touch wheel on the Wacom but still it's randomly back seat driving my interactions. I often wonder if developers live real lives. I don't think so. Like the Apple Watch Ultra. You can't fricking do pushups/planc/muscleups/dips etc because then it calls sos. Wear it the other way. No same thing. Wear it on the foot maybe? Ok. But anyway, can I set it to ONLY be active within one app, for me blender (or whatever else I want, photoshop etc) PS The settings in the Wacom app won't do it.  

PPS Yes I can put it aside but that's not the minimum annoyances workflow answer I'm looking for : ) Another solution is just do the normal thing and stop being old school with my antique no-screen intous and build a second table with a Cintiq setup and turn my chair 180 when I wanna switch between art and.. eh.. ""normal computer stuff"".. Well I guess I can optimize a bit and 90 degrees is the synth, 180 is blender/ps 270 is the coffee maker and 0/360 is ""computer""/gaming/wasteoftimestuffs.

1ha78aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudyHubNetwork/comments/1ha78aq/5_tips_for_effective_exam_preparation/,5 Tips for Effective Exam Preparation,"Preparing for an exam is not a piece of cake. You have to absorb a large amount of information, deal with a certain stress level, and often work against the clock. Let‚Äôs have a look at some tips to prepare for your exams effectively.

# Identify your weaknesses

This is the key to success. Only when you know where your weaknesses lie, can you work with them. Sometimes it helps to focus on things you would like to improve. A great strategy is to try to find something you‚Äôre good at. If you don‚Äôt feel confident when it comes to logical tasks, maybe your strong point lies in remembering things and putting different pieces of information together. Realizing this can become your starting point for planning out your exam preparation.

# Try not to be nervous before your exam

Easier said than done, right? Exams and¬†stress¬†go together hand in hand. Try a different approach. Take the exam as a challenge. Be excited about showing your knowledge. You can‚Äôt avoid being not stressed out entirely, but this way you can at least minimize the stress impact. When you prepare for your exam, enjoy the learning process. Think about it as an opportunity to organize your knowledge.

# Make sure to have enough time for revision

If it‚Äôs a difficult exam you have to study a lot for, make a plan. Write down a list of all the topics you have to study and of all the things that need to be done. Divide the topics of the exam into separate days. This way you can focus on the difficult stuff and manage to do more easier things in one day. In case something happens and you‚Äôre not able to follow your plan, you can change it. The important thing is to know what to focus on.

# Try not to learn things by heart

Sometimes there are still areas you have to memorize by heart. This mostly applies to categories of some subjects. You have to know the categories so that you know where the facts belong to. These categories can be found in¬†linguistics¬†(e. g. types of clauses),¬†biology¬†or medicine (types of muscle tissue), or any other field. These categories can help you to organize your knowledge. If you don‚Äôt have to learn anything like that, try to understand the topic you are learning about in depth. Think about a way you can link the facts you learn together. It will pay off. If you have a deep understanding of the topic, the things you‚Äôve learned will stay in your head.

# When studying, think about your well-being as well

Get enough sleep. After getting plenty of rest, your brain will function more effectively. When you study for your exam, be comfortable. Make yourself some coffee, tea, or any other beverage you like. Use your favorite cup. Organize your desk so that there is not a clutter of things on the one hand, but on the other hand, there is everything you need (e. g. a dictionary or a highlighter). Also, be sure to take breaks. During these, stretch out so that your neck doesn‚Äôt go stiff. Don‚Äôt forget to eat regularly. Indulge yourself with a good and nutritious snack. You deserve it. You work hard. These things seem to be details, but they matter a lot.¬†

I immediately went No Contact and 3 months later we started talking again. Things were going okay, I ended up visiting her town (lived 2 hours away), we had coffee, talked, cried, kissed and I went back home. We continued talking I learned some things I wish I hadn't such as who she s\*cked off, had intercourse with but was willingly to look past them because she chose me, right? Not quite. She mentioned that she will visit my town for a friend and we could meet up, that plan never went through as she went cold and if I wasn't putting in the effort to initiate conversation, it wasn't happening - I went weak and begged and pleaded until she blew me off so I stopped texting our communication died. (This was December 2023)

It was rough but I was making progress in my career, personal and social life. Fast forward to October of this year, she replies to one of my Instagram stories, we talk a bit and she disappears for a month again.

In November she sent me some old memories/photos/inside jokes and of course I replied and went down memory lane. Had some laughs, things seemed to be going well, she said that she was going to visit her friend (who lives in the city I moved to recently) on the 7th of December and that we might be able to see each other. We kept on talking, told me she dated some dude for 7 months, broke it off, asked about my dating history. Things were going well but she went hot and cold again so I just mirrored her behavior.

The day came. She was in my city on the Dec 7, replied to one of my stories saying ""Hey, I'm also in this mall, come look for me"" \*she wasn't in that mall but a completely different place\* - it was just mocking/playful we sent some pics back and forth, she was with her friend and I was with a buddy of mine. I told her ""if you can't sleep tonight, hit me up ;)"" and left the ball in her court. Didn't hear anything from her until a random 2-3 a.m. pic of her clubbing (sent it to me directly for some reason) - to which I replied in the morning ""ah cool blurry pic"". I asked her yesterday (Dec 8) if we were hanging out and she said she ""wouldn't be able to make it :("" as she was going back home that same day, which I expected as she had flaked once before but was hoping our time apart would have helped her solve some of her mental issues but that doesn't seem to be the case. To that I replied with ""I know clubbing takes a lot out of a person. If you're ever serious about hanging out, contact me, until then, don't randomly text me as we're both clearly busy adults"" ( after sending this, I got a random phone ring, but when I tried to ring back no one answered). Have been left on delivered for the past day,

I feel like she has read the message and just not opened it, doesn't matter at this point because I'm clearly a back up or used for validation. What matters is that I finally set a boundary and stood up for myself. Now, I'm about to remove all of her friends and family from my pages and hopefully keep on moving forward.

This experience set me back, I was never truly over her but was making progress. Her playing with my emotions is the thing that keeps me on the loop. No more of that, things will happen on my terms now.

TLDR: Broke up in June 2023, NC for 3 Months, talk, meet, blows me off. Ex gf breaks NC in Oct 2024, suggests meeting up, visits my city, doesn't make time for me so I tell her to only contact me if she's serious about meeting up and never text me randomly/pointlessly again.

I go through the loop each time. I reduce carbs within the construct of my Indian diet. I walk/jog for 40 minutes. I try and keep myself calm though that is a hit or a miss. And I am on Inositol. I do not restrict as in I would eat some icecream or a burger on Friday night after the whole week. But my weight does not budge. I lose the water weight at max but nothing more. I stay between 176 to 187 pounds no matter what. Then on observing for a few months, I will stop all exercise in frustration and gain a pound or two and then stop and lose it again. 
I am tired. 

For the past 3 years though, I am doing a night shift job from 7 pm to 4 am and that has affected my health as well. I sleep at odd hours and stay tired. I eat 2 meals and yet no weight loss. I eat at 2 or 3 pm and then I eat dinner at 9 pm. Nothing aside from that other than a coffee on some days at around 6 pm. 

I feel like I am being punished for wanted to eat one meal a week that I like and one coffee with oat milk that I need a day.

I‚Äôd get tired around 11a.. have a coffee, then have another around 2p. 

Now that I‚Äôm 4mo PP, I‚Äôm needing to start to exercise again. I‚Äôm tired of looking at my body and seeing my belly, and the rolls in my back. I‚Äôm very fortunate and only 10lbs from my pre pregnancy weight, but still need to lose more. (I am hovering around 175, I was 165. I‚Äôd like to get to 140 realistically but that‚Äôs a STRETCH)

The trouble is; I‚Äôm nervous to exercise again. I‚Äôm EP, and my supply has regulated. I‚Äôm between 6-10 oz per pump, 5x a day. I‚Äôm very proud of it. 

I feel like I have a hard enough time eating enough, drinking enough water (I used to drink 3L pre pregnancy - I feel like I barely hit one now) already. On days I don‚Äôt take care of myself properly, I definitely notice a dip in supply. 

Mostly, I‚Äôm worried about being tired. Being a FT mom the past 4 months is a different kind of tired than ‚Äúworking full time‚Äù tired. I‚Äôm nervous about going back full time at 5 months, and coming home to be a FT mom and wife. 

I‚Äôve been really good about caffeine consumption- only once caffeinated beverage a day. I‚Äôve been craving more sugar and trying to curb that. I hate who I am when I‚Äôm tired. I already feel like I don‚Äôt have the energy to get through my day, and I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll find the energy to exercise and get through a regular day on top of it. 

‚ÄúLook at the positives.. maybe exercise will make you feel better and give you more energy‚Äù. Sure. But I need to get over this first before I find out. 

How do I get over these nerves?

1ha6zdy,https://i.redd.it/5gm19xttxs5e1.jpeg,Sudden pain 8 months after root canal treatment,"34M, I dont drink, i only smoke cigarette.

It has now been 8 months since I had a root canal treatment. Apparently, the infection was so severe that it took three appointments to complete (they couldn‚Äôt stop the bleeding and described it as a ‚Äúvolcanic eruption‚Äù ü§£). The third appointment was with an endodontist. Even numbing didn‚Äôt work.

For the first three months, the tooth felt slightly high, especially in the mornings when I woke up, but the pain was completely gone. The discomfort gradually decreased, and the only issue left was a strange irritating sensation when I touched the tooth from the side with my finger.

I mentioned this to my dentist two weeks ago, and they told me that an X-ray wouldn‚Äôt be taken for another year because healing can take a long time. But now, for the past three days, the tooth has suddenly become very sensitive and painful when I eat something warm, causing intense pain for a few seconds. Oddly enough, I don‚Äôt experience this pain with hot drinks like coffee or tea.

What could this be? I‚Äôve always had issues with this tooth, even before the root canal when it was filled. Even the blue light used after placing the filling material caused severe pain.

I only have an X-ray from after the first treatment. If anyone notices something, please let me know.",5,1733740900.0,askdentists,5,1.0,False

She‚Äôd always end up staring at me smiling for a longer than normal amount of time, giggle at me even though id never say anything funny. The first time it happened I had brought my cat so I thought it was because of him, but throughout that month itd keep happening and I was starting to develop a crush. Im an introvert though so I never was able to build the courage to talk to her, and there was also the thought I was just delusional. Eventually I stopped seeing her for the next month. 

One random night she was all I could think of, she was so pretty and had such a lovely energy to her. I needed closure for myself so I could stop being so immature, that brings me to today. I asked the woman at the window if she still worked there (I never got her name so I spent a few moments describing her like an idiot) after she finally realized who I was talking about she turns around and points to her. I felt so embarrassed that the whole store was now listening but I couldnt back down. I asked if I would be able to get her number. The co worker quickly looked at me and told me she has a man, so I quickly said ‚ÄúOh, okay‚Äù and left. 

Now, this brings me to my question. Was I reading into her too much? Was I too late to ask? Should I had waited to see her to ask? Should I have even asked? Im just so confused and embarrassed, I also still cant get her out of my head. I‚Äôve never felt the way I felt from just some prolonged eye contact.

I had Carpal Tunnel surgery on my left (dominant hand) on 11/26. Almost immediately after surgery I thought something wasn‚Äôt right. I couldn‚Äôt lift even the coffee cup I was told I could, unable to brush my hair, grip the steering wheel, etc. My skin is extremely sensitive to touch, washing my hands burns, I get electric shock feeling in my hands and muscle spasms. My fingers up to my forearm will get extremely cold at times. 

Due to the holiday when I called the on call concerned about the pain, they basically told me to suck it up & CTR isn‚Äôt painful just mildly annoying. 

A week ago I called my surgeon back & had an appointment for Wednesday. I went in and told him about the pain I was having. Almost immediately he said he thinks I have CRPS. I know it takes people years sometimes to be diagnosed, so in that aspect I‚Äôm one of the ‚Äúlucky‚Äù ones. 

2 days after my diagnosis, i started having tremors or convulsions. It started in my left leg, then right shoulder, then right leg. When this happened I called the after hours number of my surgeon‚Äôs office. They told me that CRPS can‚Äôt cause the convulsions. I went to the ER on advice of the on call where it took 6 different medications to get it to stop. I got some sleep, but my left leg is doing it consistently since waking up the next day. 

My surgeon after diagnosis immediately sent in a referral for OT & pain medication to help me sleep. I still can barely sleep though. 

Originally I scheduled my surgery for right before thanksgiving because I figured I‚Äôd only have to take 2 days off since we had Thursday & Friday off. Now I haven‚Äôt worked but one full day. I work from home for data entry typing all day. 

I don‚Äôt know how to be able to work or sleep. My husband has to wash my hair & drive me everywhere. In a matter of two weeks I was robbed of doing anything for myself. Im still not sure if this could ACTUALLY be CRPS or if he was just in a hurry to give me an answer. 

I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm all over the place- I‚Äôm so tired. But any information and insight is appreciated. 

How do I continue to work? I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going to get fired. I asked for an accommodation to help me since I only have one functioning hand, and I was told no. 

I was also told CRPS doesn‚Äôt spread. Is this true? If it can- how long was until it spread for you?

Do we know what causes this? My daughter has something called functional neurological disorder & some of the symptoms are similar. Is there any evidence that a gene issue can increase someone‚Äôs chances of having this?

I‚Äôve been a social media manager for over 10 years, and I thought it‚Äôd be fun to give you a peek into what my day looks like. It‚Äôs not all doomscrolling and sipping lattes‚Äîalthough coffee is essential. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of my typical day, the tools I can‚Äôt live without, and how I stay on top of the ever-changing social media landscape.

# Morning: Planning, Research, and Scheduling

**6:30 AM - 8:00 AM**:  
I start my day by catching up on social trends. I scan platforms like:

* **Twitter**: What‚Äôs trending? Any breaking news or memes my brand can hop on?
* **Industry Blogs and Newsletters**: Checking trusted sources like Morning Brew, Marketing Dive, or Social Media Today for inspiration and updates.
* **LinkedIn**: Industry updates and professional content ideas.

This approach ensures I‚Äôm well-informed about the latest developments and ready to adapt to changes or capitalize on new opportunities.

**8:00 AM - 9:30 AM**:  
It‚Äôs strategy time. This involves:

* Reviewing the content calendar: What‚Äôs scheduled for today? Are there any last-minute updates?
* Checking analytics: Did yesterday‚Äôs posts perform as expected? If not, why?
* Adjusting content if a new trend or opportunity arises (social media is all about being agile!).

Tools I use during this phase:

* **Trello/Asana**: Content planning and team coordination.
* **Google Calendar**: To block out time for focused tasks and set reminders for posting.
* **Feedly**: To keep tabs on relevant blogs and news sources.

# Midday: Content Creation & Engagement

**10:00 AM - 12:00 PM**:  
Time to get creative. I brainstorm and create content for upcoming posts. This could include:

* Writing captions, sourcing images, and editing videos.
* Designing graphics using **Canva** or **Adobe Express** (for quick, polished visuals).
* Filming short-form video content for Reels or TikTok.

During this time, I also schedule posts using **Hootsuite**, **Buffer**, or **Sprout Social**. For Instagram Stories, I sometimes use **Unfold** for sleek templates.

**12:00 PM - 1:00 PM**:  
Engagement is key. I spend this hour:

* Replying to DMs, comments, and tweets.
* Participating in discussions on Reddit or niche forums to grow the brand‚Äôs visibility.
* Monitoring mentions using **Brand24** or **Google Alerts**.
* If competitor analysis or collaboration research is on the agenda, I turn to tools like **SUIVI**, a browser extension that analyzes any public page. It identifies the type of content a page typically shares, its general focus, and offers AI-driven guidance for collaboration or strategy.

# Afternoon: Analytics, Optimization, and Deep Work

**1:30 PM - 3:00 PM**:  
The afternoon is dedicated to analytics and optimization. I:

* Dive into platform-specific insights (Facebook Business Suite, Instagram Analytics, or TikTok Analytics).
* Use **Google Data Studio** or **Sprout Social** to create detailed performance reports.
* Analyze what‚Äôs working and tweak strategies accordingly (e.g., testing new hashtags, experimenting with posting times).

**3:00 PM - 4:30 PM**:  
This is my ‚Äúdeep work‚Äù time. I might:

* Develop a monthly campaign strategy or pitch ideas for seasonal promotions.
* Write longer-form content, like blogs or scripts for video series.
* Research competitors to see what‚Äôs working for them.

# Extensions and Tools I Swear By

Here‚Äôs the secret sauce for keeping things organized:

* **Grammarly**: For error-free captions and posts.
* **Later**: For Instagram and Pinterest scheduling with a preview grid.
* **Zapier**: Automating repetitive tasks (e.g., cross-posting or syncing data).
* **SUIVI**: A browser extension for analyzing social media profiles. It‚Äôs handy for evaluating influencer engagement metrics, tracking profile trends in real-time, and getting insights into viral content patterns across platforms like Instagram and TikTok.
* **Ahrefs** or **Ubersuggest**: For keyword research and SEO-focused content.
* **ColorZilla**: For perfect color matches in branding.

# Evening: Community Management and Self-Development

**5:00 PM - 6:00 PM**:  
I check in on engagement one last time for the day:

* Responding to any urgent messages or comments.
* Joining live discussions or Twitter Spaces.

**6:00 PM - 7:00 PM**:  
I spend this time leveling up:

* Reading about algorithm updates or social media marketing trends.
* Taking courses on **Skillshare** or watching **YouTube tutorials** for new tools.
* Experimenting with AI tools like **ChatGPT** for generating content ideas or streamlining workflows.

# Final Thoughts

Being a social media manager means wearing a million hats: strategist, copywriter, analyst, designer, and more. It‚Äôs fast-paced, ever-changing, and demands creativity, but it‚Äôs incredibly rewarding when a campaign takes off or a post resonates with the audience.

Fellow SMMs, what does your day look like? And if you‚Äôre curious about breaking into the field, feel free to ask me anything in the comments! üòä",5,1733740206.0,SocialMediaManagers,2,0.86,False

 and I don‚Äôt know what to do about it -
Does this seem in the norm for someone who‚Äôs just turned 2? I‚Äôm also a SAHM so I can‚Äôt compare her to her peers




My daughter turned 2 yesterday.

The last month she‚Äôs gone through what feels like a personality change.

She fights every nap, not only is she fighting it she acts mental in her bed.
Not crying but like just yelling NO NO No and turning over jumping and being crazy but if I don‚Äôt let her nap she‚Äôs feral she defiantly still needs her nap.

Then she can‚Äôt put her self to sleep anymore.
She was always able to self settle from 6-7 months of age.
Now she screeeeama for mumma or baba (dad) when we put her down and we have to sit with her.

-

When she doesn‚Äôt want something lie us to clean her face, change her, tell us no or grab something she says ‚Äúis mine‚Äù to put away even if she isn‚Äôt using it she will absolutely go mental.
Like head back, scream!! Not an ahhh scream but she will have an angry scream yelling what she wants.

She‚Äôs very smart, talks like. 4 year old. Everyone who meets her says both things.

1- woah she‚Äôs sooo smart and clever because you can have conversations with her .

(she‚Äôs also super interactive like she loves pretending to play doctors, tea and coffee with her toys hide and seek ect)

2- she‚Äôs a fire cracker.

- when she‚Äôs angry it‚Äôs game over. It‚Äôs sooo hard not to get frustrated and snap.

- she ends her tantrums fast they‚Äôre not meltdowns because she knows what she wants, they are not for no reason but she has a lot of them and she‚Äôs super bossy.

-
She has no fear!! Lately her new thing is to step of the slide instead of sitting on her bum or tummy.
And she falls on her face and tries to do it again.
Like wtf?

I get worried because I don‚Äôt remember my nieces or nephews having extremee temper tantrums.
I also don‚Äôt remember them being so fearless.

I wonder if it‚Äôs signs of adhd or if she might be high on the spectrum.


When she‚Äôs mad her voice is the loudest ever, I think my neibours can hear her yelling/screaming.
They must thing I‚Äôm torturing her.

The head back thing also worried me that she will hit on something hard one day.


Are some toddlers just crazier than others?

She gets away with things sometimes being a toddler but I don‚Äôt want her being those 4 year olds that scream down a shopping centre when they don‚Äôt get there way.

I don‚Äôt give into her either, but that doesn‚Äôt teach her.

She‚Äôs not behind in anything at all and is so smart so I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs on the spectrum but her emotions are so whack that I really question it.

She honestly starts giggling after a tantrum after she gets her way sometimes (not always but sometimes I just need too for sanity)
It‚Äôs like how did you go from 0-100 in anger to laughing one second later?

With other kids she thinks all toys are ‚Äúmine‚Äù that‚Äôs mine she says when she likes something of theirs.

But she isn‚Äôt anti social she builds towers with her older cousins but will just knock them down if she feels like it too.
She joins in in games ect what‚Äôs the time Mr wolf

She can say her ABC and count to ten but she won‚Äôt just do it if I ask her she hates sitting to learn she likes to be doing something all the time weather its playing with dolls, icecream set, blocks ect she sort of struggles with just sitting and talking with no fun incentive.

The distance isn't a major reason but we've been talking about feeling kind of drained from each other and what we should do after acknowledging this. 

I have pretty horrible anxiety and other things like being really sensitive to sensory stimuli and depression, so sometimes I end up breaking down or just feel emotionally exhausted and end up oversharing or expressing some feelings that might have caused her to feel tired because she feels helpless towards my situation, even if I've taken my meds.

I don't know if this is concerning (though I think it is) because I've done things like this before too, but she really struggles to start doing tasks like schoolwork to the point of crying from frustration due to her inability to start doing work, freezing herself so she stays awake through the night for as long as she can to see if she can get herself to do assignments, hating herself over this because she thinks she's lazy for not being able to get herself to do work even if she doesn't want to actually do it and just wants to do it out of a sense of responsibility and obligation or any other self destructive behaviour. She doesn't want to try and go to therapy or anything similar though because she thinks it's annoying and/or that she doesn't need it. She once told me that maybe someday she can finally die from a heart attack or stomach problem from all the coffee she drinks to survive the night and other things she does to hurt herself. She does worry me a lot doing that though and I really want to try and do anything I can to help, but I don't really know what to do either and I don't know how to stop worrying and the conflict between me wanting to stop her from doing all this and her not wanting to stop doing this is starting to tire me as well. 

We have tried to talk about therapy but she says she can try to do that just because I said I want her to try even if she actually doesn't want to go and I don't want to force her to do anything she doesn't want either. At the same time, she also doesn't want me to continue feeling the internal conflict between my worry towards her and her actions. I wish I know what we can do now, because we both know that we really do care for each other even when we were only friends and I don't want to leave her when she obviously has a lot going on, even when she constantly tells me to just leave her if things get too much.

I woke up with my heart pounding, but calmed down quickly because I knew it was just an awful dream. I haven't had one of those in a while, and it took me by surprise. I am thankful for my sobriety moreso than usual this morning, and IWNDWYT.",2,1733740047.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

However, when I checked this morning, the machine displayed an error stating that the batch brew could not be started. After clearing that error, I received another message: ""Insert batch basket,"" despite the basket being correctly placed.

I tried removing and reinserting the basket several times, but the issue persisted. Eventually, I had to unplug the unit from the mains and plug it back in, which finally resolved the problem.

This has been incredibly frustrating‚Äînot only did I miss my scheduled coffee, but it also made me late for work. And to top it off, the machine is barely two weeks old!

Is anyone else experiencing similar issues ?",1,1733739755.0,FellowProducts,0,1.0,False
