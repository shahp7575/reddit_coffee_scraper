If you’re running a Shopify store and spending on ads but barely breaking even (or not getting sales at all), it’s probably not your ads. Most of the time, the problem isn’t traffic — it’s what happens *after* someone visits your site.

That’s what I learned after running a few stores myself. I kept tweaking ads, changing creatives, and testing audiences, but the results barely moved. Then I realized I wasn’t doing enough with the visitors I already had.

**If your store’s breaking even (or worse, not getting sales), email flows can quietly turn that around.**

They build trust, recover abandoned carts, bring back old customers, and make your existing traffic work harder — without spending more on ads. But a lot of stores skip this step because setting up proper email flows is tedious, and most people simply don’t know where to start or how to connect all the moving parts.

That’s exactly what happened to me.

Setting up email marketing for my stores was one of the most tedious tasks I’ve ever done. It’s very segmented and needs multiple tools to get it right. For example, you need one tool for popups like Privy to gather leads, another tool like Loox or “Judge Me” for sending review request emails, a different tool such as Tidio to collect leads from chats, and another one like Klaviyo for sending automated abandoned cart or welcome emails. The list goes on.

Once everything’s set up, reality hits. Your popup tool won’t send emails, the review app demands an upgrade to send requests, and the chat app, though collecting leads, won’t send emails unless connected to Klaviyo. After spending weeks integrating all these apps with each other and more time writing your emails, designing workflows, and painfully uploading your logo, social media, and signature on each email individually, you get hit with a sinking feeling.

Your emails still don’t look consistent across all these apps, there’s nothing you can do about it, your monthly bill crosses $100, and your website slows down because you’re using ten different apps.

At the bottom of this post, I’ve attached a free PDF guide so you won’t have to go through all of that.

1o7i6aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TourDuMontBlanc/comments/1o7i6aw/post_hike_review_and_itinerary/,Post Hike Review and Itinerary,"Just hiked about half of the TMB last month and thought I would post a review.  This forum has been a huge help, and hopefully this pays it forward a bit.

We had limited time so we chose to hike from Chamonix to Switzerland.  We like to hike 15+ miles per day, but it gets hard to do that every day based on refuge availability.  Since we were heading elsewhere in Europe afterward, we did not bring our tent and camping stuff.  We also booked 2-3 months out which limited options.

We had awesome weather and hiked in mid-September.  Sunny and warm every day.  Definitely got lucky!!  Sorry for this being stream of conscious, limited time to write.

**Day 0.**  We flew into Geneva, stored our bags at the hotel we were staying at on the back end, and took the bus from the airport for like 20 bucks to Chamonix and stayed the night there before starting the trail.  We did an awesome little day hike while jet lagged up to Chalet la Floria.  Great view and chairs up there, though it was closed.  Not sure if that was because it was mid-September or just the day of the week.

**Day 1.**  We hopped the train from Chamonix to Les Houches to cut out some miles along the river that didn't look too exciting.  Went from Les Houches to Chalet Nant Borrant.  We did not know about the variant this day, but really enjoyed hiking up to the ski area, and then descending through the small villages and houses.  It was a fun day of hiking that was very different from what we do in the states.  We had lunch in Les Contamines.  Went to the grocery store in town and the bakery that was open (although we were told it was closing for the season later that week)?

We then went from Les Contamines to Nant Borrant.  It was a bit more than 15 miles altogether with  4,600+ feet of climbing.  Solid day.  This lodge was just okay.  The view is pretty good, but not as epic as others we would see later on the trail (and other refuges we stopped at along the way).  We stayed in an 8-bed dorm that had 6 people in it.  Had to use the sleeping liner.  Shower was warm.  The food, like most on the TMB (in my opinion) was not great.  I don't eat pork and the two refuges we stayed at both served it.  Also, after a long day of hiking the portions (one sausage, or for me, one piece of quiche) were quite small on the protein front.  Breakfast was also pretty sad here.  Hosts were only so friendly.

**Day 2.**  We hiked from Nant Borrant to Bonhomme and stopped there for lunch.  Awesome views from this lodge, and the pizza hit the spot.  We then took the ""variant"" to stay up high given the great weather.  We hiked to Tete Nord des Fours which was awesome.  Highly recommend scrambling up here if you take the variant.  (I also recommend the variant because it avoids what I've heard wasn't the best descent into Les Chapieux, but I haven't done it so i don't really know.)  It is an awesome 360 view with a very helpful map explaining the various peaks.  From there, we descended to La Ville des Glaciers.  This descent sucked, it was very steep and tough on my creaky knees.  But again, great views still!  We grabbed cheese in the tiny town.  Highly recommend.  We finished by walking up the road to Refuge les Mottets where we stayed the night.  We saw the cows getting milked (probably for the cheese we had!?) on the way up.  This was an 11 mile day with 4800ft of climb.  Wish we could've done more miles, but it was too long to the next lodge with availability and the climb here was serious!

This lodge is in a pretty spot! Not epic but I really liked it.  We splurged on our own room for us 2, and it had clean sheets so no liner.  The dinner was again pork, but the vibes here were much better.  They played music out of a music box (got old after a while, but fun), and the place was lively.  I was disappointed by the food given the vegetarian option was a veggieburger, but whatever.

**Day 3.**  Left Mottets and hiked up to the Italian border/pass.  Awesome view of there.  Stopped at Elisabetta for coffee.  This was awesome.  The deck there is the best place to hang that we went by on the trail.

From there we hiked to Courmayeur.  This was great up to the next pass, but once you hit the ski area around Rifugio Maison Vieille it really isnt great.  Pretty steep downhill, and you are just in the ski area which is really hot in the sun.  We got to Courmayeur and had a beer.

(Brief aside: This was a day that we kinda messed up lunch.  I think the refuge lunch boxes are a rip off, so we didn't ever do those.  But we had not really stocked up on food at the last grocery store.  Food is plentiful enough on the trail, especially before September when lodges start closing, but just think one or two meals ahead when you're in a town!).

We were going to stay at Bonatti this night originally but realized that it made for an insane day! We figured out a bus hack, but still just decided to get a hotel room which was about the same price.  We had dinner and gelato in Courmayeur, it was the right decision.  15+ miles and about 3,800ft of climb.

**Day 4.**  We figured out a way to cut some miles and get ahead this day, since we hadn't got as far as we needed to the day before.  We took a bus from Courmayeur (free!) up past Lavachey.  There is a bus stop that specifically says it's for getting to Refugio Bonatti.  We got off there, hiked the short steep uphill to Bonatti, and had coffee there.  Great view, seems like a great place to stay.  Then we crossed into Switzerland, and hiked down to Ferret.  We had to get back to Geneva this night, so we hopped the bus from Ferret to Issert, then we went to Orsieres on a train, then from Orsieres on another train to Geneva.  This was not cheap, I think like 60+ dollars each.  You can also hike further and hop this same bus near La Fouly, the trail follows the river here.  Pretty towns! This was 12.5 miles and 4,100ft of gain.

**Overall.**  We absolutely loved it and highly recommend it.  September was awesome for us.  A bit annoying when things were closed at times (we expected as much).  Otherwise the crowds were tamer (I assume!) and we got awesome weather.  It was also great to hike without huge packs! We brought too much stuff even still, as we are used to tent backpacking.

As pretty fit hikers, I think we could've done the whole trail with perfect planning (getting all the right refuges etc.) in 6 days.  Any faster is just not worth it.  It is nice to sit at the refuges, meet people, and take your time in town/at other refuges along the way.  That said, some of our days were a bit short and so we took our time more than usual in getting out the door and when taking stops.

  
I also think that unlike in the States, one huge perk of this loop is that you can cut it down in some places, take alternates, and get to refuel in towns pretty consistently.  We used that to our advantage to cover lots of ground in a short time.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

I’m planning to spend at least a month in Bangalore, mainly to explore the startup ecosystem and connect with smart, high-energy people.

A bit about me: I came from Palo Alto earlier this year and have been living in Jaipur since February, building my own startup. I paused it last month and decided to take some time to explore new problems, meet more founders, and just get a feel of what people are building here.

Jaipur’s great, but not exactly buzzing with that startup energy yet; so Bangalore feels like the right place to immerse myself for a while.

My goal for this visit:  
• Live somewhere central where I can bump into founders / builders / cracked people easily  
• Work out of WeWork or other coworking spaces or cafés with startup folks  
• Attend events, meetups, demo days  
• Have real conversations with people building interesting things

Would love suggestions on:  
• Best neighborhoods to live in for at least a month.  
• Any coliving spaces / Airbnbs / places where I’ll meet other founders  
• Slack / Telegram / WhatsApp communities worth joining  
• Regular meetups or coworking spaces with great vibes

Would also love to meet folks here who’re building something cool, happy to grab coffee or collaborate on side projects while I’m around.

Appreciate any pointers, would mean a lot 🙏",1,1760550603.0,Bangalorestartups,0,1.0,False

I’m planning to spend at least a month in Bangalore, mainly to explore the startup ecosystem and connect with smart, high-energy people.

A bit about me: I came from Palo Alto earlier this year and have been living in Jaipur since February, building my own startup. I paused it last month and decided to take some time to explore new problems, meet more founders, and just get a feel of what people are building here.

Jaipur’s great, but not exactly buzzing with that startup energy yet; so Bangalore feels like the right place to immerse myself for a while.

My goal for this visit:  
• Live somewhere central where I can bump into founders / builders / cracked people easily  
• Work out of WeWork or other coworking spaces or cafés with startup folks  
• Attend events, meetups, demo days  
• Have real conversations with people building interesting things

Would love suggestions on:  
• Best neighborhoods to live in for at least a month.  
• Any coliving spaces / Airbnbs / places where I’ll meet other founders  
• Slack / Telegram / WhatsApp communities worth joining  
• Regular meetups or coworking spaces with great vibes

Would also love to meet folks here who’re building something cool, happy to grab coffee or collaborate on side projects while I’m around.

Appreciate any pointers, would mean a lot 🙏",1,1760550529.0,BangaloreSocial,1,1.0,False
1o7hxp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleverGoatStore/comments/1o7hxp4/the_brain_song_review_my_thoughts_after_a_few/,The Brain Song Review: My Thoughts After A Few Weeks,"So I finally caved and bought that digital audio thing, The Brain Song, that's been showing up everywhere (and honestly, looks Skeptical AF). For those who haven't seen the ads, it’s basically just one 17-minute audio file that claims to use Gamma waves to stimulate BDNF, which is supposed to crank up your focus and memory.

I was expecting a total scam, but I figured since it was a single one-time payment—not another subscription—it was a low-risk experiment.

I’ve used it every morning for about 20 days now. Here are my super honest thoughts:

The Real Results (The Good Stuff)

Brain Fog is Muted (Seriously): This is the most noticeable change. My mornings used to involve staring blankly at my screen for 30 minutes while my coffee did the heavy lifting. Now, I listen to the track with my over-ear headphones, and within minutes, the mental static just settles down. I can go straight into my tasks without that frustrating ramp-up time.

The Focus Is Effortless: It's not a stimulant high; it’s more of a deep, quiet concentration. I feel like I can hold multi-step problems in my head much longer. If your job involves anything requiring sustained thought (coding, writing, complex spreadsheets), this alone might be worth it.

Memory Taps are Quicker: I'm not suddenly reciting Shakespeare, but the little things—recalling names, where I left my keys, facts for a discussion—feel less like a search party and more like a quick retrieval. Maybe the BDNF thing isn't totally BS?

Love the No-Subscription Vibe: Huge win that it's a one-time purchase. Just download the file, and you own the brain hack forever.

The Annoying Caveats (The Cons)

You Need Good Headphones: I tried listening on my phone speakers once. Don't bother. The whole effect is based on specific frequencies, and cheap earbuds won't cut it. Factor in decent headphones if you don't already have them.

Zero Variety: You get one 17-minute track. That’s it. It’s ambient, kinda spacey-electronic. If you get bored easily, this will definitely be a negative. I wish they had 3 or 4 different versions just for variety.

Results Aren't Instant: The focus effect is fast, but the bigger changes in clarity took about two weeks of daily use to really lock in. If you buy this expecting to be smarter tomorrow, you'll be disappointed and quit early.

Final Verdict / TL;DR

Despite looking like marketing BS, this single audio track actually works for me as a low-effort daily routine. It’s not magic, but it’s a powerful tool for killing distraction and boosting mental clarity.

My parents used to fight a lot to but recently they separated and both of them have custody over us, and my sister's childish behaviour intensified since this happened.

They didn't raise the same way either. I grew up as a responsible kid, I knew what was right and what was wrong. My sister on the other hand, she was given a phone a year ago when she was 9. She didn't learn to take ""no"" for an answer, and I always see her laying on the couch for hours a day (and also during the night) with her phone actually less than 2 inches away from her face. You can see the picture.

These last 2 months she has been insufferable. She is mean and despises me and my mom, and honestly just the whole family, mostly the kids her age. My mom is very affected with her behaviour but doesn't know how to make it right, nor is she trying to do with my sister what I tell her she should be doing. I'm having headaches just from living here, and as I'm writing this I'm thinking that ""spoiled"" falls short for her. She even drinks coffee which she makes herself following the instructions my mom taught her some days ago just to make her shut up.

Right now she's lying on the couch while my mom does her homework almost crying. I just can't keep seeing this kind of things around my house.

How should I advise my mom? How should I correct my sister's behaviour?

It's been 18 months of remote work and I'm not okay.

 I wake up. I walk 10 feet to my desk. I work alone for 9 hours. I walk 10 feet back to bed. My Slack status is green but I haven't had a real conversation in weeks. 

""Quick sync?"" = 5 minute Zoom where everyone's camera is off and we're all multitasking 

""Team bonding?"" = Awkward virtual happy hour where we stare at each other through screens 

""Water cooler chat?"" = Dead Slack channels with occasional GIF reactions 

I used to complain about open offices. About commutes. About having to wear pants. I'd give anything for that now. 

I miss: 

* Spontaneous conversations that led to solutions 
* Lunch with coworkers where we talked about nothing 
* The energy of people around me Someone noticing when I'm struggling 
* Eye contact 
* Feeling like part of something

Instead I'm just a Slack avatar. A GitHub username. A Zoom rectangle with my name at the bottom.

 My friends tell me to ""just go to a coffee shop"" but it's not the same. Everyone there is also alone, pretending to be productive, avoiding eye contact. 

I joined a coworking space. Spent $400/month to sit near other people who also don't talk to each other.

 My partner keeps asking why I'm in a bad mood all the time. I don't know how to explain that I'm just... depleted. That Slack messages aren't the same as human interaction. That I'm starting to forget how to have normal conversations.

 Companies saved money on office space and called it ""flexibility."" What they actually did was isolate us all in our little boxes and now we're too far in to admit it's not working.

 I don't have a solution. I just needed to say it out loud: Remote work is lonely as hell and I don't think we're built for this.",1,1760550423.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

A quick bio about me. 
 one of my passions is global solo travel. Been to 5 trips over the last just over a year. Banff Calgary, amsterdam, Berlin, Tokyo, Kamakura, Reykjavik Iceland, heading out to Stockholm Sweden this Friday and then Norway also as a short detour which I guess will make my trip count seven.. I do this because it challenges me to get out of my box, allows me to maintain my Edge or social and Street smarts, and it allows me to learn how to adapt to different cultures different people so that I can become a much more effective relationship builder, 

I also used this as therapy instead of pills or actual therapy when my dad passed away as an anchoring tool. I also used four other tough challenges. It was a challenge for me because I hated flying leave alone across the world and definitely leave alone by myself, and lastly at night time with no visibility out the window over oceans. 


Anyways open to connecting with anybody who's also into Global solo travel, in and around midtown, maybe we can grab a coffee or a tea or maybe even a drink even though I don't really drink but occasionally I'm open to it. I'm free tomorrow night since I'm flying out on Friday. 

A few other things I'm into are industrial music Creation in my home studio started to work on an EP, living an active and adventurous lifestyle, live shows, mainly metal and alternative rock like Alice in chains, ministry, filter, nine inch nails, skinny puppy, fear factory,,,

I'm of tan Asian Canadian nationality but to be honest with you more American and Canadian because I was raised in this beautiful country. Plus spent a lot of time in the US due to family being there.

I don't really have a lot of friends by choice as I'm so busy working on some creative projects, holding down a Bay Street consulting sales job plus a few other things, and I'm not really into just hanging out for the sake of hanging out or feeling a sense of friendship with just anybody. I'm very selective and I guess because of that I haven't found my tribe yet. Still I manage quite well solo as I'm sure a lot of us do also who are not part of the popular Crowd or who don't have tons of friends. 

Anyways if what I wrote made you even slightly curious then feel free to reach out and let's talk and meet.

I’m 5'8, wear glasses, brown skin, dark hair and eyes. I work as a software developer. I don’t smoke or drink. I’m Christian, and my faith matters to me, but I’m open to anyone who respects that.

I’m a bit introverted at first, but once I’m comfortable I talk a lot, stay loyal, and keep things consistent. I don’t like drama - I prefer slow and steady connections where we can take time to know each other.

Most evenings are simple: coffee, soft music, and a good show. I enjoy small chats about how the day went, sharing songs, laughing at funny scenes, and making little plans we actually do.

I like anime and K-dramas (Naruto and Demon Slayer are favorites), Turkish shows, and story-driven movies. I listen to all kinds of music and love finding new tracks for late-night playlists. I cook simple meals, enjoy hiking, quiet walks, stargazing, and I’d pick a museum or café over a party any day. I used to game a lot, now it’s just Genshin once in a while. I love travel (Japan and Switzerland are dream spots), but I also enjoy calm weekends at home.

I’m looking for someone kind, steady, and emotionally open. Long distance is fine if both try equally. If it feels right, I’m open to closing the gap.

If this feels like your vibe, just say hi with your age and location - we can talk and see where it goes .Thanks for reading. Take care!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

For those who haven’t read Part 1, The Plague Towns is a random nonfiction book I found in my grandpa’s stuff that claims to be from the year 2041. It’s written by someone named Ava R. Schmidt.

Now considering how far I dove the first time around, I wasn’t expecting to find anything, and I was right. I searched for other works by Schmidt, lost nonfiction stories, and I even considered it may have been part of some obscure unfiction project or ARG. But again, nothing.

Then I considered, maybe my grandpa wrote it. Yeah, it would be weird, but that’s a whole lot more realistic than some random-ass book teleporting from the future into my grandparents’ house. So I went to ask my grandma about it.

My grandma was ecstatic to see me. Admittedly, I haven’t visited since my grandpa died, I just can’t bring myself to. The house hasn’t been the same since. Not like it’s haunted, but… I don’t know. It’s a strange feeling. You look at everything and remember all the time you shared together. I remember watching Disney movies and Goosebumps with him and my siblings in the living room, feeding the chickens he used to have while he warned me about the electric fence, giggling as he told exaggerated tales about the pranks he used to pull back in the day. Even the bad times I still think of fondly.

Sorry, I got off-track.

Anyways, after some small talk, I asked my grandma about the book. She said she didn’t remember ever seeing it, let alone Grandpa writing it. This makes sense with how buried it was under all his other stuff (his office was cluttered as hell), but it doesn’t get me any closer to a real answer. 

But I guess that’s how the cookie crumbles. If you guys have any suggestions or questions, please go ahead and put them in the comments; maybe they’ll give me some ideas.

The show must go on! Here’s the next chapter (warning: it’s much shorter than the first one).

THE PLAGUE TOWNS (BY AVA R. SCHMIDT)

CHAPTER 2: TRANSMISSION

The Monday Maxine went to work at the Red Lodge Postal Office, she touched 194 letters and 26 packages. In total that’s 220 contaminated objects. About 89% of these letters and packages were local deliveries, but the others?

Eleven arrived in New York City. Four in Houston, seven in Chicago, one in Miami, and one in Phoenix. These are among the most populated cities in the United States of America.

All contaminated. All infected.

It wasn’t long before strange cases started to be reported in Wyoming, New York, Texas, Illinois, Florida, and Arizona, then the states surrounding them too. Strange thick snot dripping from children’s nostrils, teenagers letting out hard, hacking coughs, adults vomiting and pissing themselves at work, the elderly grinding their dentures down to thin stumps, it was all there. Hospitals begged for help from the government, but they simply brushed it off, stating they had more pressing matters to worry about.

Two and a half weeks after Maxine’s death, a press conference was held with President Davidson. A reporter asked if he planned on addressing the health scare spreading across the country. The president proceeded to blame the scare on drugs hopping over the Mexican border and ranted about how pregnant women were taking Tylenol for five minutes. Nothing of actual use was said.

In the last moments of the conference, he sneezed. His tie was stained with thick, greenish-yellow snot.

And that’s not to mention the people at Maxine’s Christmas party.

Anthony was on a flight to California to visit family when his headache, one he’d had persistently since the day before, suddenly began to pulse and throb, like his heart had moved up to his brain. He figured it was just another one of his migraines, but he finally became concerned when he had rather unpleasant diarrhea in the airplane bathroom. It was bubbly, like greenish-brown sparkling water. It smelt like death too.

It was 3 A.M. when he threw up in the middle of baggage claim, and soon enough he was in a first aid station sneezing and coughing his lungs out. He was admitted into a nearby hospital about an hour later, unconscious from the pain. His family visited him, and his mother gave him a kiss on the cheek, something she always did when he was sick. His sweat tasted sour.

He died two days later. During the cremation, someone swore they could hear him growling inside the furnace.

Anthony’s mother got a bad cough in the middle of the funeral service.

Meanwhile, Penni was at home, trying to stay hydrated as she withered on her couch. It was stained with piss and shit, but she was so out of it she didn’t even care anymore. All she wanted to do was stay inside and quarantine. Whatever she had was, she didn’t want anyone else to get it. She wouldn’t let herself be a vector.

The infomercial on her television babbled on about some useless nonsense as Penni felt something growing under her chin. Brushing her fingers against the tender flesh, she winced as something slick met her touch; sweat, but something else too. Pus.

A second later the pimple burst, white juices spraying across her discolored pajamas. Then it began to bleed. Nonchalantly Penni tried to rub away the mess with the back of her hand, her eyes growing heavy. *I just need to wipe it off,* she told herself. *I just…*

Penni shut her eyes, and her body went limp.

On her coffee table, her phone began to ring. It was her sister, Jackie. She had been trying to contact her ever since she heard about Maxine’s death. In fact, it was all over the local news. No one had ever seen this kind of disease before.

Eventually Jackie came over to check on her, using the spare key Penni kept under her doormat. Approximately two minutes later the nearest 911 center received this call:

911 OPERATOR: “911, what’s your emergency?”

\[Whimpering can be heard on the other side of the call, along with distant growling.\]

911 OPERATOR: “Hello? Is anyone there?”

JACKIE DONOVAN: (crying) “Something’s wrong with my sister.”

911 OPERATOR: “Okay honey, can you tell me what’s happening?”

JACKIE DONOVAN: “She’s bleeding… She’s bleeding everywhere… She…”

911 OPERATOR: “Has she been attacked? Where are you?”

JACKIE DONOVAN: “I-I’m hiding in the closet. I don’t know what’s wrong with her. She hadn’t been answering my calls, I just wanted to check up on her, and…” (sobs) “I don’t know what to do… Oh God…”

911 OPERATOR: “I’ve sent police and medical to your address, Ms. Donovan. They should be arriving in ten minutes. Now, has your sister been attacked?”

JACKIE DONOVAN: “I don’t know! She tried to attack me when I came in, I-”

\[Jackie gasps as the sound of banging and rattling door hinges becomes audible.\]

JACKIE DOVOVAN: “Oh no, no…”

911 OPERATOR: “Jackie? Is there a way you can get out of-”

\[The banging and rattling gets worse, and a rabid growling can be heard; Jackie begins to scream.\]

JACKIE DONOVAN: “NO GOD PLEASE NO, NO PENNI, OH GOD-”

\[The door opens. The sounds of screaming and tearing of flesh are deafening. Most of the yelling is unintelligible.\]

911 OPERATOR: “Hello? Miss?”

\[A minute of screaming and tearing passes, the operator continuing to prod.\]

\[The call disconnects.\]

When the police arrived at Penni’s residence, she was nowhere to be found. The only evidence she had ever been there were the bodily fluids smeared all over her home. Jackie’s corpse was found in the bedroom closet, completely mauled and unrecognizable; the coroner had to identify her via dental records.

Then there was Becca and Stevie. They went missing about three to four days after coming into contact with Maxine; all their belongings had been left at home, including their phones, keys, wallets, and even shoes. The backyard door had been left wide open. Their dogs, Sol and Luna, were found unharmed and adopted not long after. They’re still alive today.

Imagine how many people Anthony, Penni, Becca, and Stevie interacted with before they passed or went missing. Imagine how many things they touched. Just imagine.

Safe to say it’s been… an experience. Every profile feels like déjà vu, the same clichés on repeat.

**Here are the greatest hits:**

1. A story about almost getting arrested abroad (Barcelona, Ibiza, Prague - bonus points if it involves “skinny dipping” or “stealing a street sign”).
2. Generic hobbies: “traveling, food, long walks, wine” - wow, you and literally every human being alive.
3. Scheduling a date that feels like booking a meeting with your manager. *“How does 3 weeks from Thursday look for a quick 30-minute coffee slot?”*
4. A proud declaration that you’re a “plant mom,” immediately followed by “lol I kill every plant I touch.” (Congrats, you’ve mastered the art of buying ferns just to commit slow botanical murder.)
5. Something about being “fluent in sarcasm” like it’s a rare skill.
6. A claim that you’re “so bad at texting” even though your screen time is 9 hours a day.

So let’s skip all that.

About me: I’m in London, I work in finance, and yes, I travel (though I’ve never been “detained in Spain,” so maybe I’m missing out). I’m more into finding the best dim sum spot in Chinatown, a strong negroni, or a last minute trip abroad.

What I’m looking for: something light, casual, fun. Not a serious relationship right now. Just meeting people who don’t treat dating like an admin task, enjoying a laugh, and seeing where it goes without the pressure.

**Things I appreciate:**

* A conversation that lasts more than 4 texts.
* Someone who can enjoy both a ballet at the Royal Opera House and a late-night kebab on the way home.
* A partner who doesn’t think “traveling” is a personality, but still has a valid passport.
* A sense of humour about how ridiculous dating apps have become.
* Binge watching reality tv and gossiping about the drama.
* Meeting IRL - London based only.

If you’ve made it this far, don’t just write “hey.” Tell me your funniest bad-date story or your most absurd travel fail. I’ll return the favour and actually ask you out without needing three Google Calendar reminders.",0,1760550275.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Sorry about that. Things got weirder, if you can believe it.

It all started with that stupid wet patch, right in the middle of the hallway wall. In hindsight, I am not a clever man. To be fair, I never claimed I was.

A damp spot wouldn’t be entirely unbelievable. I live in a pretty old building and my landlord is shady as can be, and most of the other residents are, well, old? Rent is pretty cheap, so I never complained when things didn’t get fixed and shit like that. Not my jam.

Guess that might not matter, anymore.

I was collecting snails, as you do. Had lost count of the dumps, at that point. I know I was up to four separate piles in different locations, and that the number kept creeping down. I know the last count was 587, at least.

When I returned from that last dump, it was already dark outside. *Very* dark. That kind where the streetlights don’t reach very far, just a slight orange-red glow right beneath. Bit spooky, to be honest, which was the first warning sign: I am not usually afraid of the dark. Not at all.

I was halfway through taking my shoes off when I noticed it again. I looked not because I *wanted* to but because I *had* to. Second warning.

I could feel it, then: The anchor. It felt… different, from others. Usually, the anchors feel *heavy*. It’s not a physical sensation as much as an emotional one. You’re drawn to it, it *wants* you to look. It wants to scare you.

This one felt more hollow, or inverted. The usual pressure in my bones wasn’t present, there was no *pull*. 

I walked closer, anyway. Why had it suddenly decided to appear?

My eyes were locked to the patch, and I approached with my single sneaker, left the other one by the door. 

It looked as if it pulsed, or bulged, when the low light hit it. It was strangely illuminated, even though my apartment was pretty dark. There was no way it *actually* bulged, my brain reasoned. Surely it must be a trick of the light? 

I got closer, rested my hand next to it. The wall felt solid. I gave it a knock, and it sounded like it should. Not hollow. Woody and solid. I can’t really explain what happened next.

Right next to my hand, a bubble was forming in the wallpaper, distorting the daisy above it grotesquely. 

It grew, stretched, and— *pop!*

Skalman, his little splotch even more smudged than before, slid out. Landed on the skirting board with a soft click.

I stared at him.

He stared back, I think.

Then, another *click*. And another. And another. Then the entire patch gave way.

You know how it feels to peel off a scab? If that made a sound, *that’s* what that sounded like. Horrible and papery and *wet*, and for a split second I knew exactly what would transpire, yet I didn’t move.

An *impossible* amount of snails came pouring out of the slit, an obscene and slow fall of soft clicks and little heads and eyeballs and mouths and it *just kept coming*.

They brought the smell with them, growing for each snail that was making its way out: sick and sweet, of mould and decay and rot and forest. Of earth and dirt and rocks and soil and—

By the time my brain *finally* decided that stepping back was a fine idea, the whole wall looked alive. The paper bulged and rippled and *pulsed*, the wall following along in soft ripples, and there were snails *everywhere*. The outline of the patch seemed to grow, wider and taller, as the slit opened more. 

I said something brave, like “oh fuck me oh hell no”, and then the lights went out.

The silence that followed wasn’t normal. It was deep and dull, and everything disappeared at once: I couldn’t hear my own breaths, or the buzzing of the freezer, or my heartbeat. I couldn’t feel anything either. As if all my senses went out with the light. 

Then, they were back. In the dark. On me and over me and *everywhere*. Tiny ribs and shells and mouths, chewing and kissing and leaving wet trails all over my body and limbs. Sure, snails aren’t *fast*, but there were *so many of them*.

When my brain caught up for the second time, I think the first thing I did was scream until my throat was hoarse. Then, I clawed. I scratched and ripped and spun around like a clumsy ballerina, trying to get these fuckers *off*. It was entirely an animalistic instinct, by the way, I don’t think there was a singular conscious thought in that entire sequence. Just *off with them!*

I stumbled, backward. Still blind and deaf and mute and numb. Eventually, I hit the other opposing hallway wall. My back went from damp and cold to *wet*, the remaining shards sharp. It startled me enough to force my feet forward, and—

*Crunch*

*Crunch*

*Crunch*

It felt as if I was stepping on glass marbles, soaked in thick syrup. The floor suddenly had a give it didn’t have before, my feet sinking down with each wet, crunchy step into the carpet of shells and slime and pulsing meat.

I tripped, then. I don’t know on what. I caught myself on the doorframe, and I know this because I could see again.

Then, nausea hit me like a truck. For a moment, everything spun around and around and around and there was snails everywhere still and I couldn’t fucking *breathe*.

Then, just all at once, it stopped. I was completely still, for a little while.

There were no snails, not on me. My eyes were locked to the floor, though, and that was *covered*. Not snails, mind you, but their bones. Shells of all colours, the usual. 

When I reached for the switch, my fingers sank into the wall. Not entirely through, not clean like that, but still *into*. Felt like pushing my hand into a soggy loaf of bread, but still better than the snails eating my skin flakes. I pulled back, looked. The plastic of the switch had been pushed into a palm-shaped hole.

It was dark, still. No lights were on. I was still undeniably in my apartment, though, which felt comforting for all of two seconds. Then, I noticed two things.

Firstly, I could see my living room window when I turned my head. I was no longer on the fifth floor. 

Secondly, Skalman was sitting on my phone, on the floor, softly illuminated by the screen. There were no traces of other, well, *live* snails. I snatched the entire setup up, inspected him closely.

He looked like a snail.

No glowing eyes, strange markings, no secrets etched into his shell. Just a very average, very moist yet *normal* snail, with a smudged splotch on his shell and a cool name. I almost laughed.

The background of my phone, below his trail, was a photo of a forest. Looked like one of those standard ones, you know? Except, my background had been this stupid picture of a *really* nice kebab I had taken months ago. Nope, no more kebab: Just pine trees.

The same ones I could see outside the window.

I don’t even know how to begin to describe the situation, from here. It’s difficult.

I am not at home, except I kind of am? Like, my apartment is here. Just a box of wood frame and plaster board, if you look at it from outside. It’s no longer in the building, obviously.

My phone works fine, but obviously I don’t have water or electricity. 

That felt like a win, at first, but less and less since time passed here. What do you *do?*

Call 112 (that’s 911, for you Americans)? The city council?

*Yes, hello*, *I would like to report subpar living conditions… oh? Where? Well, nowhere!*

Nope. Google it? What the fuck do I *google?* I thought this post was to be the helpful thing and honestly, so far I’ve only gotten one or two leads. I guess no one knows about snauntings, or wherever the fuck I am at.

I did call Henning, and registered an emergency ticket. I don’t know.

It took four tries to reach Henning, and he was *underwhelmingly* upset about the situation I had found myself in.

“Why are you *calling* me?” He whined. “You haven’t picked up a new assignment for the last week.”

“Uh, yeah. That’s the thing.”

I explained, or at least I tried to. Patch, snails (more snails), walls. The not-fifth floor. The pine trees. I even described Skalman in detail, because why not? 

Henning listened, patiently. Didn’t interrupt, but I could tell the air over the crunchy line was one filled with a slight annoyance. When I finished, there was a long pause. I held my breath. 

Then, he sighed heavily. I could hear rustling in the background.

“Alright,” he started. “So, you’re stuck somewhere *weird.*”

“Yeah.”

“And you don’t know if it’s a *where.”*

“Correct.”

“And there’s still ghost snails.”

“Not ghosts, and not snails. Just shells. And Skalman.”

“Well. Good for you.”

Another pause. I could almost hear him scroll through whatever mental spreadsheet handlers keep in their big brains, looking for the entry for “ghost snails” or “accidental trans-planar housing incident”. With snails. Snincident?

“Here’s what I’ll do,” he said, softly. “I’ll open a secondary ticket and get that streamlined for you, see if we can get an Archivist to help out. Easier that way. Then, I’ll also contact maintenance. Y’know, just in case.”

“In case of *what?*”

“Well, in case this were to take a dark turn. Sorry to be blunt, but there’s not much we can do without more information. I guess you’re going to have to gather that.”

He sighed heavily. More rustling. Papers being moved, the scratch of a pencil.

“Meanwhile,” he continued, “I’d suggest you do your fucking *job*, Arvid. You’re a Banisher. Not a very good one, by the sound of it, but you need to do *something*. What’s gonna happen, more snails? So far, they haven’t hurt you. I don’t even think they’re important.”

I paused then, too. Except for the, well, hurting of my feelings a little, he had a point.

There was not more to the exchange, really. He just kind of reiterated “do your job you moron”, then hung up.

So, anyway. I’ve been bringing Skalman on walks, around the… eh, neighbourhood? It just looks like forest to me, except unusually crunchy. Just pine trees and roots, the occasional moss or fern. Smells exactly as you’d expect, too. Haven’t seen any more snails, either.

I’ve also done inventory. I have most of my shit still, interestingly. So, bags of salt. Some holy water. Herbs, iron, planks. Chants and charms, the lot. The only thing that clearly *is* missing is my one sneaker, the one I took off before digging myself deeper in the shit, and I still haven’t found it.

Annoying, but I had more shoes. So, eh. It was a damn good sneaker, though.

I have been preparing. To do what I *know* works, at least some of the time: A banishment ritual.

Now, I am not entirely sure *which* one to do. I don’t know which religion or belief had anchored, eh, snails? And pine? Into existence.

I figure I can’t make shit worse, anyway, so I think I’ll just… combine. 

There’s not really been any more spooky shit, except that I don’t know where I am or what the fuck is going on. I don’t dare to go too far away from the apartment-non-apartment, but it’s been two days or whatever and it feels odd to be this alone.

Sure, I have always been alone, I think. A little bit. But there’s still *people* everywhere, you know? On the streets, in the buildings, out and about and inside. Everywhere, at any point, within a few kilometres: people. I never thought about it as a fundamental truth, not until it no longer felt like it *was* one. It feels less safe, I guess. Something primal with groups, with *adjacency*.

Anyway. Back to the banishment, and my attempt so far.

For my first try, I went with a hybrid. The ol’ “when in doubt throw the entirety of the pantheon at it” approach. Bit of psalms, some Norse wards, a sprinkle of folk charms and generic chants for extra flavour. Salted the floor in a half circle, mixed it with two different herb mixes. Smells pleasant in here now, if nothing else. Set up some candles (battery-driven, because apparently I came prepared for liminal camping), poured a little of the holy water into a chipped coffee mug.

It’s hard to pray when you don’t know what for or to *what*, but I gave it my best shot. When nothing really seemed to change, I resorted to begging. A little might not hurt, you know?

“I don’t know what you are,” I said to the wall or the air or myself. “But I am asking you *very* nicely: Please let me go home. Thanks.”

Nothing answered. The candles flickered a little, but they’re *built* to do that, so do with that information what you will.

Skalman had teleported to the opposite side of the room, from my shoulder, sometime during the setup. He was happily munching away (I think) at the soggy wall, as far away from the… ritual-site as he could get.

Now, that’s interesting. Could mean *something* worked.

Or maybe he just has boundaries. Recognises crazy when he sees it, that stuff.

Either way, I guess I’ll have to keep watch tonight. It’s still *too* quiet.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o7hg1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1o7hg1t/could_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_from_hario/,Could the best pour over coffee maker from Hario enhance your brew,"The Hario PDA-02-T has been a recent addition to my morning coffee ritual, and I've genuinely enjoyed putting it through its paces. As someone who appreciates the simplicity and ritualistic experience of manual pour-over coffee makers, this product had me intrigued. The minimalist design, paired with the promise of evenly extracted coffee, seemed like the perfect solution for both coffee enthusiasts and everyday users. Of course, while it does come with its highlights, there are a few considerations to keep in mind. Here’s my experience, testing it daily as my go-to coffee companion.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this manual coffee maker was its sleek, clear exterior. It’s compact, lightweight, and fits perfectly on my kitchen counter without taking up much space. The dimensions (10.92""D x 10.92""W x 4.83""H) make it easy to handle, while the reusable filter aligns well with sustainability-conscious coffee drinkers like me. Its clear materials give it a modern and clean aesthetic that blends beautifully with different kitchen styles. While it feels durable, I did notice it lacks the somewhat heavier, sturdier feeling that pricier models often offer. 

**Ease of Use**  
This product touts itself as beginner-friendly, and I can affirm that it genuinely is. To use it, you simply place the drip-assist accessory on any 02 V60 dripper and pour hot water–sounds almost too simple to mess up, right? Even my slightly clumsy teenager managed to make himself a cup of coffee without complaints. There’s no need for a fancy gooseneck kettle either. Instead, the water flows evenly through different-sized holes, ensuring a consistent brewing speed. The built-in instructions for pouring 50-70ml into the center ring, waiting 30 seconds, and finishing by pouring into the outer ring make it foolproof to use, even if you’re multitasking on a groggy morning. 

**Coffee Quality**  
Coffee lovers obviously want one thing from their tools: a perfect cup of coffee. The Hario PDA-02-T delivers satisfying results. The even-flow V60 Coffee Dripper allows water to flow seamlessly into the central section of the filter, which prevents overpouring accidents (yup, been there, done that many times with my old setup). The brew is clean, flavorful, and aromatic, which I attribute to how well it balances water flow and extraction. However, for those who love experimenting, the lack of advanced controls might feel limiting. Despite this, for everyday cups, it’s hard to complain about the outcome.

[Check HARIO PDA-02-T price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b08xbjnvqh/)

**High Points**  
- The drip-assist feature eliminates the need for a gooseneck kettle, saving users from extra expenses.  
- Perfect for consistent brewing even if you’re a pour-over beginner.  
- Its lightweight and compact design make it travel-friendly.  
- Environmentally friendly due to its reusable filter.

**Negatives**  
- The clear, lightweight design can feel slightly fragile when compared to heavier, professional-grade coffee makers.  
- It lacks advanced customization features like flow control or temperature regulation for enthusiasts looking to micromanage their brew.

**Challengers**  
Comparing this product with others in the pour-over market, one clear competitor is the Chemex series. Chemex is known for its elegant glass structure, which immediately feels more premium, but it’s bulkier and less beginner-friendly compared to the straightforward design of Hario’s coffee maker. On the budget-friendly side, there’s the Kalita Wave, which offers a more robust build and flat-bottomed drippers for more temperature stability but might sacrifice portability. If ease of cleanup is critical, both Chemex and Kalita Wave fall short as their designs tend to be fussier compared to this product. However, for those looking to experiment with grind textures and flow, some competing options might give you more creative wiggle room.

**Affordable Quality**  
On the subject of value, this product strikes a fair balance between quality and cost. It doesn’t aim to be the flashiest or most feature-rich device on the market, but it stands as a reliable and affordable option for creating delicious coffee at home. Given the reusable filter and diminished need for additional tools like a gooseneck kettle, the savings over time make it an appealing investment for casual coffee drinkers and aspiring connoisseurs alike. If you want a simple and efficient coffee maker with no unnecessary bells and whistles, this feels worth every penny.

I restrict a lot during the day and B/P every night without fail. Both the restriction and the B/P episodes have gotten more and more severe. 
In addition to that, I am very active and work out every single day. 
I know this is bad and every single day I have full intention of making the day a good day - I want to eat, I want to fuel properly and I want to make it a healthy day. But my brain is flooded with thoughts and decision anxiety sets in - too many food choices and everything feels so complicated that I end up choosing just the least caloric option or skipping all meals during the day and just drinking coffee or maximum a protein shake. Then the night comes and I am a different person, this monster takes over and I flush an entire family’s worth of food down the toilet. It’s horrible, it’s unsustainable, it is wasteful, it is unproductive, it is making me unstable, foggy, forgetful and anxious.

I've been downing energy drinks like a mad man for nearly three years now. I'm concerned about long term effects. I have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and high blood pressure. My fears that drinking so many all the time are eventually going to have strain on my heart, liver, or kidneys. 

That said, I've been known for some periods to drink two a day. I generally try to NOT go over the recommended 400mg threshold when I do. 

I also have to limit sometimes when I drink them, especially at work. I have a really physical job, and they have a tendency to make me feel drenched in sweat and anxious. Funny, when I drink them when I'm not working, I feel fine. But sometimes, getting through a hard shift at work... They give me an extra boost on specific days when I need it a lot.

I mean, I suppose having one lower caffeine ED once a day wouldn't technically be that bad. I love Rockstar Original Sugar Free, and they have very low caffeine at 160mg, but also 12oz mini cans with only 120mg. That's what, about as much as a cup of coffee? Obviously, it's not just the caffeine, but still....

Any thoughts? And as much as I try to slow down and give them up almost completely... They.. taste.. too.. good! Since Sunday, I've had 2 Rockstar sugar free original, and 1 C4 cherry popsicle. That's really not that much for me.",1,1760549326.0,energydrinks,3,1.0,False

He had always been a bit flirty and asked me out at the beginning of our friendship but I am A.) a lesbian and B.) in a long term relationship so I shut it down hard. He took it well but I’m now realizing that he focused more on the relationship status part because now as I am newly single a few weeks ago he asked me out again. I said no and because he’s a fairly sensitive guy made an off hand joke like “if only you were a girl! but I appreciate our friendship. Again he took it well and I forgot about it. 

Cut to yesterday. He didn’t respond to my text for a week or so and when he finally did he asked to get coffee/study as we usually do, in a few hours. When I get there I see him at our usual table with a long wig on. I make a joke like are you incognito right now?

Like in-person coffee chat, hiking, walks, trying something new that gives excitement. I am extrovert. or ambivert as well. Don't hold high sensitive mindset or boundaries. easy going.

I will be traveling to Oaxaca 10/29 - 11/3 for Dia de Muertos. I am writing to ask for some tips and recommendations. All your feedback is much appreciated.


Currency Exchange

I hear the best way to get the local currency is to use the ATM machines at the airport, and decline conversion rate. Is there a specific branded ATM i should use?  How much cash should I take out? How likely are restaurants and businesses to accept Visa credit card?


Airport Transport to Hotel

I’ve read the best way is to take the shared bus/collectivo. Is this the case or should I call a Didi? 


Monte Alban

I know for sure that I want to check out Monte Alban. I will probably take a Didi. Can I buy tickets at the gate or is there a chance that they sell out? I am afraid to get there and not being able to get tickets especially during this busy period.


Local Sports

I’ve heard there is a futbol team, baseball team, and luche libre in Oaxaca. Will there be any sporting events during my stay? 


Food / Restaurants

I know I must try Tlayuda, but are there any other specific Oaxan cuisine I must try? Are there any restaurants, bars, coffee shops, or food stands you recommend?


Local Activities

What do the locals do? Are there comedy clubs? Is there an open mic?

My ex (29F) and I (29M) broke up around the end of August. It was a mutual, respectful breakup I had to go back to the US to finish my last year of uni, and we realized our long-term goals and where we want to live in the future didn’t really line up.

We dated for about 3 months. After the breakup, she said she hoped we can be more platonic and wanted to stay friends, but her texts went from paragraphs to short replies, and eventually we just stopped talking. We’ve been in no contact since September 15th.

I was thinking about reaching out in December when I’ll be back in Canada for a few weeks, maybe to ask if she wants to grab coffee or something. There’s no bad blood between us, but part of me worries that by then she’s moved on cause on insta she seems happy, out with friends, living her life, seems like she already forgot about me.

Has anyone here reached out to an ex after a friendly breakup and how did it go?",2,1760549236.0,Life,2,1.0,False

1o7hbms,https://www.reddit.com/r/prisons/comments/1o7hbms/part_2_the_pariah_by_charles_bowden_esquire/,"PART 2 The Pariah by Charles Bowden /Esquire magazine, September 1998/ Interview with LA DEA Supervisor Mike Holms and Hector Berrellez (KIKI Camarena Murder Investigation Operation Leyenda) A secret agreement was found in 1995 by Gary Webb allowing government agents to smuggle drugs into USA","\-Part 2

For six weeks after his series came out, Webb waited in a kind of honeymoon. His e-mail was exploding, he recalls, ""from ordinary people who said, 'This has restored my faith in newspapers.' It was from college students, housewives that heard me on the radio; it was really remarkable to think that journalism could have this kind of effect on people, that people were out marching in the streets because of something that had been hidden from us all these years. The thing that surprised me was that there was no response from the press, from the government. It was total silence.""

 

Finally, in early October, The Washington Post ran a story by Robert Suro and Walter Pincus headlined, THE CIA AND CRACK: EVIDENCE IS LACKING OF ALLEGED PLOT. The story focused in part on the fact that Webb had given a defense attorney questions to ask Oscar Danilo Blandon about his CIA connections. It also quoted experts who denied that the crack epidemic originated in Los Angeles, disputed that Freeway Rick Ross and Blandon were significant national players in the cocaine trade of the eighties (pegging Blandon's coke business at five tons over the decade, whereas Webb had evidence that it was more like two to five tons per year). And, the article continued, there was no evidence that the black community had been deliberately targeted (the ""plot"" referred to in the headline and a claim never made by Webb), that the CIA knew about Blandon's drug deals (also a claim never made by Webb, who in the series merely connected Blandon to CIA agents), or that Blandon had ever kicked in more than $60,000 to the contra cause (the Post based this number on unnamed law-enforcement officials;

Webb based his estimate of millions of dollars to the contras from dope sales on grand-jury testimony and court documents). Perhaps the best summary of the Post's retort to Webb came from the paper's own ombudsman, Geneva Overholser, some weeks later: ""The Post...showed more passion for sniffing out the flaws in San Jose's answer than for sniffing out a better answer themselves. They were stronger on how much less money was contributed to the contras by the Mercury News's villains that their series claimed, how much less cocaine was introduced into L.A., than on how significant it is that any of these assertions are true.""

 

In late October, the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times weighed in on consecutive days. The Los Angeles Times had two years before described Freeway Rick Ross vividly: ""If there was an eye to the storm, if there was a criminal mastermind behind crack's decade-long reign, if there was one outlaw capitalist most responsible for flooding Los Angeles's streets with mass-marketed cocaine, his name was Freeway Rick....Ross did more than anyone else to democratize it, boosting volume, slashing prices, and spreading disease on a scale never

before conceived....While most other dealers toiled at the bottom rungs of the market, his coast-to-coast conglomerate was selling more than five hundred thousand rocks a day, a staggering turnover that put the drug within reach of anyone with a few dollars."" In the 1996 response to Webb's series, the Los Angeles Times described Ross as one of many ""interchangeable characters"" and stated, ""How the crack epidemic reached that extreme, on some level, had nothing to do with Ross."" Both stories were written by the same reporter, Jesse Katz, and the 1996 story failed to mention his earlier characterization. The long New York Times piece the following day quoted unnamed government officials, CIA personnel, drug agents, and contras, and noted that ""officials said the CIA had no record of Mr. Blandon before he appeared as a central figure in the series in the Mercury News.""

 

A common chord rang through the responses of all three papers: It never really happened, and if it did happen, it was on a small scale, and anyway it was old news, because both the Kerry report and a few wire stories in the eighties had touched on the contra-cocaine connection. What is missing from the press responses, despite their length, is a sense that anyone spent as much energy investigating Webb's case as attempting to refute it. The ""Dark Alliance"" series was passionate, not clinical. The headlines were tabloid, not restrained. But whatever sins were committed in the presentation of the series, they cannot honestly be used to dismiss its content. It is puzzling that The New York Times felt it could discredit the story by quoting anonymous intelligence officials (a tack hardly followed in publishing the Pentagon Papers). In contrast, what is striking in Webb's series is the copius citation of documents. (In the Mercury News's Web-site [version-cgi.sjmercury.com/drugs/postscriptfeatures.htm](http://version-cgi.sjmercury.com/drugs/postscriptfeatures.htm) \-- are the hyperlinked facsimiles of documents that tug one into the dark world of drugs and agents.) But when Jerry Ceppos, the executive editor of the Mercury News, wrote a letter in response to the Post's knockdown, the paper refused to print it because a defense of Webb's work would have resulted in spreading more ""misinformation.""

 

Despite Ceppos's initial defense of the series, the Mercury News seemed to choke on these attacks, and Webb could sense a sea change, But he kept on working, building a a bigger base of facts, following its implications deeper into the government. When the Mercury News forced him to choose between a $600,000 movie offer and book deals and staying on the story, Webb picked the story\*\*.\*\* He kept discovering people who had flown suitcases full of money to Miami from dope sales for the contras. He documented Blandon's contra dope sales from '82 through '86. Gary Webb was on a tear; he was going to advance the story. Almost none of this was published by the Mercury News; the paper grudgingly ran (and buried) one last story on New Year's Eve 1996.

 

The paper had printed the story of the decade, the one with Pulitzer prize written all over it, and now was unmistakably backing off it. Webb entered a kind of Orwellian world where no one said anything, but there was this thing in the air. The Mercury News assigned one of its own reporters to review the series, using the stories of the L.A. Times, The New York Times, and The Washington Post as the benchmark for what was fact.

 

Webb wouldn't admit it to himself, but he had become a dead man walking.

 

WHEN HECTOR BERRELLEZ SPENT HIS YEAR GOING TO MOVIES IN Washington, he knew he was finished in the DEA. One day in October 1996, a month after he retired, Hector Berrellez picked up a newspaper and read this big story about a guy named Gary Webb. Hector had lived in shadows, and talking to reporters had not been his style. ""As I read, I thought\*\*, This shit is true\*\*,"" he says now. He hadn't a doubt about what Webb was saying. He saw the reporter as doomed. Webb hit a sensitive area, and for it he would be attacked and disbelieved.

Hector knew all about the Big Dog and the Big Boy rules.

[https://medium.com/matter/blood-on-the-corn-52ac13f7e643](https://medium.com/matter/blood-on-the-corn-52ac13f7e643)

Hector's body aches from the weight of secrets. When we meet, he is in a white sport shirt, slacks, a blue blazer with brass buttons, and a shoulder-holstered 9mm with fifteen rounds in the clip and two more clips strapped under his right arm. He may be a little over-armed for his Los Angeles private-investigation agency (the Mayo Group, which handles the woes of figures in the entertainment industry -- that pesky stalker, that missing money -- for a fat fee up front and two hundred dollars an hour), but not for his history. For the rest of his life, Hector Berrellez will be sitting in nice hotels like this one with a cup of coffee in his hand, a 9mm under his jacket, and very quick eyes.

 

He saw a lot of things and remembers almost all of them. He wrote volumes of reports. **In 1997, he was interviewed by Justice Department officials about those unseemly drug ledgers and contra materials he saw during the raid on the fourteen Blandon stash houses back in 1986.  His interviewers wanted particularly to know whether anyone besides Hector had seen them. They then told Hector that they couldn't find the seized material anymore.**

 

Before he retired, Hector was summoned to Washington to brief Attorney General Janet Reno on Mexican corruption. He talked to her at length about how the very officials she was dealing with in Mexico had direct links to drug cartels. He remembers that she asked very few questions. Now he sits in the nice lounge of the nice hotel, and he believes the CIA is in the dope business; he believes the agency ran camps in Mexico for the contras, with big planes flying in and out full of dope. He now knows in his bones what the hell he really saw on October 27, 1986, when he hit the door of that house in the Los Angeles area and was greeted with politeness and fresh coffee.

 

But he doesn't carry a smoking gun around. The photos, the ledgers, all the stuff the cops found that morning as they hit fourteen stash houses where all the occupants seemed to be expecting company, all that material went to Washington and seems to have vanished. **All those reports he wrote for years while in Mexico and then later running the Camarena case, those detailed reports of how he kept stumbling into dope deals done by CIA assets, never produced any results or even a substantive response**.

 

Hector Berrellez is a kind of freak. He is decorated; he is an official hero with a smiling Ed Meese standing next to him in an official White House photograph. He pulled twenty-four years and retired with honors. He is, at least for the moment, neither discredited nor smeared. Probably because until this moment, **he's kept silent.**

 

And Hector Berrellez thinks that if the blacks and the browns and the poor whites who are zombies on dope ever get a drift of what he found out, well, there is going to be blood in the streets, he figures -- there is going to be hell to pay.  He tells me a story that kind of sums up the place he finally landed in, the place that Gary Webb finally landed in. The place where you wonder if you are kind of nuts, since no one else seems to think anything is wrong. An agent he knows was deep in therapy, kind of cracking up from the undercover life. And the agent's shrink decided the guy was delusional, was living in some nutcase world of weird fantasies. So the doctor talked to Hector about his patient, about whether all the bullshit this guy was claiming was true, about dead men and women and children, strange crap like that. And he made a list of his patient's delusions, and he ticked them off to Hector. And Hector listened to them one by one and said, ""Oh, that one, that's true. This one, yeah, that happened also."" It went on like that. And finally, Hector could tell the shrink wondered just who was nuts -- Hector, his patient, or himself.

 

ON SUNDAY, MAY 11, 1997, GARY WEBB WAS hanging wallpaper in his kitchen when the San Jose Mercury News published a column by executive editor Jerry Ceppos that was widely read as a repudiation of Webb's series. It was an odd composition that retracted nothing but apologized for everything. Ceppos wrote, ""Although the members of the drug ring met with contra leaders paid by the CIA and Webb believes the relationship was a tight one, I feel we did not have proof that top CIA officials knew of the relationship."" Fair enough, except that Webb never wrote that top CIA officials knew of the contra-cocaine connection. The national press wrote front-page stories saying that the San Jose Mercury News was backing off its notorious series about crack. The world had been restored to its proper order. Webb fell silent. He had to deal with his own nature. He is not good at being polite. ""I'm just fucking stubborn,"" he says, ""and that's all there was to it, because I knew this was a good story, and I knew it wasn't over yet, and I really had no idea of what else to do. What else was I going to do?""

 

What he did was have the Newspaper Guild represent him in arbitration with the Mercury News over the decision to ship him to the wasteland of Cupertino. ""I'm going to go through arbitration, and I'm going to win the arbitration, and I'm going to go to work,"" he says. ""I was just going to fight it out. This was what I did, this was me, I was a reporter. This was a calling; it was not something you do eight to five. People were not exactly

beating down my door, saying, Well, okay, come work for us. I was...unreliable."" So he went to Cupertino, and he wrote stories about constipated horses and refused to let his byline be printed. And then he went to his

apartment and missed his wife and family and watched Caddyshack endlessly. He was a creature living a ghostly life. The only thing he didn't figure on was himself. Webb slid into depression. Every week, the 150-mile drive between his family in Sacramento and his job in Cupertino became harder. Every day, it was harder to get out of bed and go to work.

 

And he was very angry most of the time. He says, ""I was going to live in my own house and see my own kids. At some point, I figured something was going to give."" Finally, he couldn't make it to work and took vacation time. When that was used up in early August, he started calling in sick. After that, he went on medical leave. A doctor examined him and said, ""You are under a great deal of stress,"" and diagnosed him as having severe depression. He couldn't sleep. He couldn't do much of anything. He decided to write a book about ""Dark Alliance,"" but this time no one wanted it. His agent was turned down by twenty-five publishers before finding a small press, Seven Stories, that operates as a kind of New York court of last resort.

 

A job offer came from the California state legislature to conduct investigations for the government-oversight committee at about the same money he made for the Mercury News. His wife said, Take the job. Why hang around in this limbo? Webb thought about her words and told himself, What do I win even if I do win in arbitration? I get to go back to my office and get bullshitted the rest of my life. He watered his lawn, worked on the house, read more and more contra stuff. Drifted in a sea of depression. ""I didn't know what to do if I couldn't be a reporter,"" he says. ""So all of a sudden, I was standing there on the edge of the cliff, and I don't have what I was doing for the last twenty years -- I don't have that to do anymore. I felt it was like I was neutered. I called up the Guild and said, 'Let's see if they want to settle this case.' They sent me a letter of resignation that I had to sign.""

 

Webb carried the letter with him from November 19 to December 10 of last year. Every day, he got up to sign the letter and mail it. Every night, he went to bed with the letter unsigned. His wife would ask, Have you signed it? Somebody from the Mercury kept calling the Guild and asking, Has he signed it yet?  ""I mean,"" he says softly, ""writing my name on that thing meant the end of my career. I saw it as a sort of surrender. It was like signing,"" and here he hesitates for several seconds, ""my death certificate.""

 

But finally he signed, and now he is functionally banned from the business. He's the guy nobody wants, the one who fucked up, the one who said bad things. Officially, he is dead, the guy who wrote the discredited series, the one who questioned the moral authority of the United States government.

 

If Gary Webb could have talked to a Hector Berrellez in the fall of 1996, when his stories were being erased by the media, Hector would have been like a savior to him. ""Because he would have shown what I was reporting was not an aberration,"" Webb says now, ""that this was part of a pattern of CIA involvement with drugs. And he would have been believed."" But Webb was not that lucky, and the Hectors of the world were not that ready to talk then. So Webb was left out there alone, one guy with a bunch of interviews and documents. One guy who answered a question no one wanted asked.

 

I CAN HEAR HECTOR BERRELLEZ TELLING ME that I will never find a smoking gun. I can hear the critics of Gary Webb explaining that all he has is circumstantial evidence. Like anyone who dips into the world of the CIA, I find myself questioning the plain facts I read and asking myself, Does this really mean what I think it means?

 

**-- In 1982, the head of the CIA got a special exemption from the federal requirement to report dealings with drug traffickers. Why did the CIA need such an exemption?**

\-- Courthouse documents attest to the fact that the Blandon drug organization moved tons of dope for years with impunity, shipped millions to be laundered in Florida, and then bought arms for the contras. Why are Gary Webb's detractors not looking at these documents and others instead of bashing Webb over the head?

 

\-- The internal CIA report of contra cocaine activity has never been released. The Justice Department investigation of Webb's charges has never been released. The CIA has released a censored report on only one volume of Webb's charges. The contra war is over, yet this material is kept secret. Why aren't the major newspapers filing Freedom of Information \[Act\] requests for these studies?

 

\-- The fifty-year history of CIA involvement with heroin traffickers and other drug connections is restricted to academic studies and fringe publications. Those journalists who find themselves covering the war on drugs should read Alfred McCoy's massive study, The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade, or Peter Dale Scott and Jonathan Marshall's Cocaine Politics: Drugs, Armies, and the CIA in Central America.

 

\-- Following the release of ""Dark Alliance,"" Senator John Kerry told The Washington Post, ""There is no question in my mind that people affiliated with, on the payroll of, and carrying the credentials of, the CIA were involved in drug trafficking while involved in support of the contras."" Why has the massive Kerry report been ignored to this day?

 

\-- On March 16, 1998, the CIA inspector general, Frederick P. Hitz, testified before the House Intelligence Committee. ""Let me be frank,"" he said. ""There are instances where CIA did not, in an expeditious or consistent fashion, cut off relationships with individuals supporting the contra program who were alleged to have engaged in drug-trafficking activity, or take action to resolve the allegations.""

 

**Representative Norman Dicks of Washington then asked, ""Did any of these allegations involve trafficking in the United States?""**

 

**""Yes,"" Hitz answered.**

 

The question is why a mountain of evidence about the CIA and drugs is ignored and why the legitimate field of inquiry opened by Webb remains unpursued and has become journalistic taboo.

 

Maybe the CIA is great for America. But if it is, surely it can roll up its sleeves and show us its veins.

 

WEBB AND HIS WIFE, SUE, ARE STANDING IN the driveway with me after a Thai dinner in Sacramento. The night is fresh; spring is in the air. A frog croaks from the backyard on the quiet and safe suburban street. Sue has just finished rattling off details from one facet of the contra war, the CIA drug-airline operation run out of Ilopango airfield in El Salvador. She seems to have absorbed a library of material over the last three years of her husband's obsession. Before, he always worked like hell, she knows, but on this one he brought it home. He could not keep it separated from his wife and family and his weekly hockey games. So Sue, with her winning smile and cheerful ways, has become an authority on America's dark pages. And we stand there in the fine evening air, the rush of spring surging through the trees and grass and shrubs, talking about the endless details of this buried episode in the secret history.

 

And I wonder how Webb deals with it, with all the hard work done, with all the facts and documents devoured, and with all this diligent toil resulting in his personal ruin, depriving him of the only kind of work he has ever wanted in his life.

 

And I remember what he said earlier that day while he sat in his study, leaning toward me, his right hand gripping his left wrist: ""The trail is littered with bodies. You go down the last ten years, and there is a skeleton here and a skeleton there of somebody that found out about it and wrote about it. I thought that this is the truth, and what can they do to you if you tell the truth? What can they do to you if you write the truth?""

1o7hbhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reduction/comments/1o7hbhj/i_finally_did_it_my_breast_reduction_story/,I Finally Did It — My Breast Reduction Story,"Hey everyone! 

This post is for anyone who, like I once did, has been quietly lurking here—scrolling through before & afters, reading advice, soaking in support, but still too nervous to take the first step. If that’s you, hi— you’re exactly who I’m writing this for!

First, I need to say this: this community is magic. You all are my heroes. Truly. The courage to post photos, share recovery tips, ask “is this normal???” at 2AM, and lift each other up—this group got me through every anxious moment. So thank you. One for all and all for one (plus two drains and a compression bra, am I right?).

**Part 1: How It All Started**

My boob journey started early—way too early. At 10 years old, I was already a size C while my friends were still out here collecting stickers and not back pain. By middle school, the bullying started—nothing dramatic, but enough to make me deeply insecure.

At 12, I was doing ballet (my passion), but my teacher told me—very rudely—that I shouldn’t continue because of my “huge boobs” (yes, she actually said that). Imagine telling a child her body disqualifies her from doing what she loves. That stuck with me.

I don’t remember a single day growing up where I liked my chest. Pretty bras? Forget about it. Grandma bras only. The “industrial grade” kind. I used to cry in fitting rooms all the time. I thought breast reduction meant chopping everything off and getting implants—I had no idea it was a real, accessible surgery.

About five years ago, I finally started researching. And then—pandemic. Life paused. But my boobs? Oh no—they kept growing like they had a personal growth mindset coach. A year ago, they also started getting noticeably asymmetric. That was my breaking point.

I said: **Enough**. Time to stop surviving and start LIVING in my own body.

**Part 2: The Doctor Hunt (a.k.a. My Speed Dating Phase)**

I joined this group (best decision EVER), made a list of recommended surgeons, USA/NY based and checked who was in-network with my insurance. I did multiple consultations:

**Dr. Kiwanuka** – Loved her. Very smart, very attentive. But no drains + surgery done in an ambulatory center and I really wanted a full hospital setting.

**Dr. Karanetz** – Sweet and professional, but we just didn’t click.

**Dr. Choi** – Honestly really liked her and almost went with her.

**Dr. Karp** – **The one**. First consultation and he immediately got what I wanted—100%. He’s a board-certified plastic surgeon, Plastic Surgery Service Chief at Tish Hospital, and I just trusted him instantly. Also — shoutout to his team Pam and Brooke — absolute angels.

**Pre-Op Appointment**

About a month before surgery, I met with Dr. Karp again. We reviewed photos, confirmed expectations, talked scars, nipples, symmetry—everything. We also laughed a bit, which made me feel human and safe. I left the office feeling **excited, not scared**. That’s how I knew I made the right choice.

**Part 3: Night Before Surgery**

I worked right up until surgery day (why am I like this?). Came home, took off my **36J** bra, looked at the girls and said, “It’s been a ride, but it’s time.”

Slept on my belly like a reckless queen one last time.

**Part 4: Surgery Day**

Checked in at the hospital 6:00 AM. First surgery of the day. Not nervous at all—I kept telling myself: This is medically necessary. This is for my health. This is for ME.

Met my anesthesiologist (loved him), and Dr. Karp came to draw on my boobs like Picasso with a Sharpie. At 7:45 I walked into the OR. They put on a warm blanket and compression boots (no catheter). I literally said: “Why do I feel like I’m at a spa? I might fall asleep before the anesthesia.”

Everyone laughed. And then… I woke up and it was DONE.

**Part 5: Waking Up Post-Op**

I was shocked by how alert I was. No nausea. Pain was maybe 4/10. I also had a mild sore throat from the breathing tube during anesthesia—nothing terrible, just feels like day-two of a winter cold.

First thing the nurse asked:

“Water, juice, or coffee?”

I heard coffee and yelled YES PLEASE before she finished the sentence. I had been eyeing the nurses sipping coffee all morning like a caffeinated little goblin.

I also really needed to pee and had a mini panic because I thought I wouldn’t be able to get up. Nope — I walked fine and didn’t need help. After 1.5 hours I was discharged.

**Part 6: First 24 Hours at Home**

I didn’t buy a fancy wedge pillow or pregnancy pillow—I built a pillow fortress. Worked great. I DID buy a mastectomy pillow because I have clingy cats who fully believe my chest belongs to them.

I didn’t buy special bras—my surgeon gave me super soft surgical bras that are actually great. I’ve been living in pajamas with inside pockets (perfect for drains btw).

I was surprised how much I could do—reach for things, drink from a cup, use the remote (and lose it again), even brush and braid my hair. Pain is manageable, mostly drain discomfort, nothing dramatic.

**1 Day Post-Op (Today!)**

Today my boobs feel sore but nothing crazy — like day 3 after an intense chest workout I definitely did not do. Tylenol is handling most of it. I also still have a tiny sore throat from intubation but tea + honey helps.

1o7h7st,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1o7h7st/dont_wait_take_the_leap/,Don't wait — take the leap,"Take that crazy leap of faith. Say the words now. Tell people you love them. Apologize when you should. Forgive. Everything in life has an expiration date. Opportunities don’t wait until you’re ready. Miss them now and you miss them forever.

But what does “don’t wait” actually look like day-to-day? 

1. Say the words.
Too many feelings sit in our chests because we’re waiting for the “right” moment. There is rarely a perfect moment. If someone matters to you, tell them. Not tomorrow. Not when you’ve rehearsed it perfectly. Speak it plainly: “I love you,” “I appreciate you,” “You inspired me today.” Small admissions change relationships, and big admissions change lives.

2. Take the leap.
That idea that keeps whispering in your ear? The one that feels both terrifying and thrilling? Try a small experiment. Commit 30 days to it. Book a single meeting, buy the domain, sign up for the class. Movement reduces fear. Action creates clarity.

3. Apologize when you should.
Pride is costly. An honest apology is short, genuine, and immediate: acknowledge what you did, name how it affected the other person, and offer to make it right. Don’t wait for the other person to demand it — that only prolongs the wound.

4. Forgive to unshackle yourself.
Forgiveness isn’t for the person who hurt you; it’s for your peace. It doesn’t mean excusing bad behavior. It means you choose not to carry that resentment as ballast. Practice it: write (and then destroy) a letter you don’t send. Release the story that keeps you stuck.

5. Treat chances like perishable goods.
Opportunities — jobs, conversations, travel, mentorship — have windows. The shelf life varies, but it exists. When you see a door that opens even a little, step through. If it closes, you learn faster and you’re still standing to find the next one.

6. Tiny habits that keep you from waiting

Set a 10-minute timer: spend it calling one person you’ve been meaning to call.

If you feel fear, do one small thing that contradicts it. (Say “yes” to a coffee, submit a draft, hit send.)

Keep a “say it now” note on your phone — three names you’ll contact this week.

Maintain a “forgive list” where you write down and release a grievance once a month.

7. Consequences aren’t dramatic — they’re real.
Not taking chances doesn’t always produce fireworks. It quietly narrows your life: fewer stories, fewer relationships deepened, fewer “remember when” moments. The regret of not trying often outlasts the discomfort of trying.

8. Courage is a muscle.
It grows with repetition. The more you speak, risk, apologize, and forgive, the less each act costs you emotionally. Start small, then scale. Celebrate the attempts, not just the outcomes.

Final note — a short challenge:
Today, do one of these three things: tell someone you love them, apologize to someone you’ve wronged, or send that idea into the world. Take a picture of the sent message or jot down how it felt. Repeat next week.

Don’t wait for a green light you may never get. Life hands out chances in imperfect windows — lean forward, make noise, and live with fewer what-ifs.",1,1760548884.0,Life,1,1.0,False

Gym shoes laced, hair brushed, coffee in hand, smiling when people walked by.

But underneath it all, I was falling apart.

I wasn’t eating properly. Meals were skipped or half-hearted, because my mind was too crowded with worry, shame, and obsessive thoughts about him. My stomach ached constantly, bloated and angry from malnutrition and stress. I’d force myself to eat sometimes, but it felt like punishment — every bite a reminder of what I was “supposed” to do to be good enough.

My hair started falling out in clumps.

My skin erupted in angry patches I couldn’t cover no matter how many creams, toners, or concealers I tried.

My body felt weak, my energy nonexistent, and I could feel my bones under my skin when I got out of bed.

I kept telling myself I looked fine.

That no one could tell I was unraveling.

That I was just “a little tired,” just “losing weight from stress,” just “not myself lately.”

But the truth was written all over me.

My clothes hung off me like they didn’t belong to my body anymore. My eyes were sunken, my skin dull and dry, my lips cracked. Every photo I took — and there weren’t many — looked haunted. My face was hollow. My collarbones sharp enough to cut glass.

People noticed.

The girls at work whispered, the customers looked too long, my family spoke to me like I might shatter if they said the wrong thing. I brushed it all off — laughed, made a joke, deflected. Because admitting I looked sick meant admitting I was sick.

In my head, I thought I was holding it together.

In reality, I looked like a junkie. Thin, twitchy, eyes wide and unfocused, always looking like I hadn’t slept in days.

I was 50 kilograms of denial wrapped in expensive skincare and caffeine.

Emotionally, I was a storm.

One second laughing with coworkers, the next crying in the shower, shaking, heart hammering like I was in danger again. The smallest triggers — a message alert, a memory, a laugh in the wrong tone — sent me spiraling.

I realized too late that I wasn’t doing this for me.

Every therapy session, every gym visit, every “healthy habit” was meant to impress him, to prove I was worthy, to convince him to stay or come back.

But the more I tried, the more I unraveled.

The trauma wasn’t gone. The abuse hadn’t disappeared. It had just seeped into my routines, my habits, my body, my very cells.

And the cruelest part?

Even at my lowest, even while my hair fell out and my body ached, I still believed — truly believed — that I could be enough for him.

I wasn’t enough.

1o7h7mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_chemex4coffee/comments/1o7h7mr/light_roast_the_subtle_art_of_revealing_coffees/,Light Roast — The Subtle Art of Revealing Coffee’s True Character,"When we talk about specialty coffee, the first thing that comes to mind is roasting, that magical stage that transforms green coffee beans into a source of aroma, flavor, and balance.



But today, the world is witnessing a clear shift toward light roasting, which has become a new language for roasters to express the identity of the farms and regions of origin.



Light roasting doesn't mean the coffee is unfinished; rather, it celebrates the natural essence of the bean.



In this type of roasting, relatively low temperatures are maintained, typically between 195 and 205 degrees Celsius, and roasting is completed just after the first ""pop,"" before the deep caramelization process begins.



The result? Bright fruity flavors, luminous acidity, and a stunning aromatic complexity reminiscent of fine wines or natural juices.



What distinguishes light roasting is that it reflects the signature of the farmer, climate, altitude, and soil more than any other type.



Yemeni coffee, for example, might have notes of peach, grape, honey, and chocolate, while Ethiopian coffee might exude lemon and jasmine, while Colombian coffee might have notes of apple and honey. All this is achieved thanks to the precision of roasting, which doesn't overpower the coffee's origin.



Modern roasting techniques now rely on digital control programs that track the temperature curve in seconds, allowing the same flavor to be reproduced repeatedly with near-scientific precision.



Some roasters have also begun using infrared spectroscopy to monitor the development of sugars and acids during roasting, in a fascinating blend of art and science.



Light roasting today isn't just a fad; it's a new philosophy for specialty coffee—one that puts the farmer first and transparency of flavor as a top priority.

if i don’t count the nautica voyage (which smells like water at this point after 6 months) and acqua di gio-on-tap ( a type of on-demand perfume clone available in italy ) , This Khamrah Qahwa by lattafa is the first proper fragrance i ever owned, 
for the longest time , whenever i tried a fragrance, i never knew how to endure the stingy opening note abd to go towards the middle note, almost everything smelled like alcohol, 
so i was surprised when one of my friends insisted that i would really love it , 
as i had some money to splurge , i bought it and wow, everything changed, 
even the opening smell that i was always  expected to be alcohol like, was a really sweet bakery type smell. 
although i heard it is a ciffee version of qahwa, even after 2 weeks, i didnt manage to find it, 

but no matter, i was  very satisfied,
but recently i have been more amazed as i was trying a synthetic fbric t shirt and i put it away in friday , 
when i picked it up again on monday to wear, there was still smell of the qahwa clearly smellable (?). 

even during the metro travel after 8 hours of class, i could smell my shoulder clearly and it smelled so nice. 

if i had to talk about compliments , i’m not a good looking guy , so i never expect it , i wear it for myself, 
but in a morning class one day, one of the girls was saying that “this room smells like coffee, i’m hungry now “,

so maybe thats something

and from then on, i reduced it to spraying 6 sprays rather than 8. i dont wanna burden others with the smell, which can be overbearing in my opinion.

in any case. i dont know the notes, nor the  similarities to the “og” ,i dont have a sophistiolfactory gland.
im a college student with limited amount of money. and i love the smell !

1o7h6ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1o7h6ci/serious_eye_issue/,Serious Eye Issue,"This story is about my eyes - both of them.
The problem started last year, around March or April. Over 18 months ago.

My eyes began to get tired very quickly. I couldn’t keep them open; they would start blinking uncontrollably within a few seconds. Then they became red, painful, and irritated. Small white-yellowish pieces started to build up during the day, and I had to clean them several times daily.

Sometimes, when my eyes were extremely tired and painful, mucus would build up overnight, drying and closing my eyes shut.

The first time I noticed something was seriously wrong was when I couldn’t even focus or look people in the eyes while talking — my eyes would suddenly get tired, start blinking uncontrollably, and my eyelids just wanted to close.

Over time, I also realized that I often unconsciously strain my eyes, eyelids, and the muscles around them, almost as if I’m constantly tensing them without noticing. I feel that this tension also contributes to my eyes getting tired very quickly.

It got worse. During regular work meetings with 10–15 people in a room and a projection board, I couldn’t concentrate. It was especially bad when several people spoke at once, and I tried to focus on listening.

One thing worth mentioning is that during those meetings, the lights in the room were dimmed — and that made things even worse for me.

Eventually, it got so bad that I couldn’t drive my car anymore — not even as a passenger. I tried using public transport, but the same thing happened: my eyes got tired, and I couldn’t focus on what was in front of me.

Going to the cinema was out of the question. Once the lights went down, my eyes would hurt so badly that I had to leave before the movie even started. Watching TV at home is sometimes impossible too — especially at night when the room is darker. It’s easier during the day with natural light.

One particularly bad episode was when a friend came to visit. He sat with his back to a large window, and I faced him and the window. It was a rainy, cloudy day, so the room wasn’t bright. I talked to him for maybe an hour without a break, trying to look him in the eyes. But I felt as if the dim light and daylight coming through the window confused my eyes — they didn’t seem to know where to focus.

After that, my eyes were very sore, red, swollen, and inflamed. You can see in the picture how bad they were.
Link to pictures: https://imgur.com/a/bad-eye-problem-DYh8scw

Funny thing is, Ice Cubes kind of relexed the eye. I did cool the both eyes for 5-10 minutes. Maybe it only felt good, but I think it really relaxed the eyes and the eyelids.

Another new  trigger that I found out just a couple of days back was looking through my door peephole — closing one eye and straining the other to see who was outside on the stairs. After only five seconds, my eyes started to feel extremely tired, and I immediately knew I’d made a mistake because it would take hours for them to recover. Even my girlfriend noticed and said, “What triggered your eyes again? You’re blinking so fast!”

I also went to an optician for a vision check — I see perfectly well and don’t need to wear glasses.

As I mentioned, it all started between March and April 2024. During that time — and in the months before — I was under a lot of stress at work. I was constantly thinking about work, often bringing it home, working overtime, and even early in the mornings before work.

I had migraines almost every day and took a lot of Thomapyrin INTENSIVE (which contains 250 mg acetylsalicylic acid, 250 mg paracetamol, and 50 mg caffeine) — sometimes even two or three tablets a day. I also took ibuprofen, usually on an empty stomach — about 90% of the time.

In addition to that, light often triggers my migraines or eye pain. Sometimes, when I wake up in the morning, even the small light from my phone when the alarm goes off can cause sharp pain — usually behind one eye — that lasts the entire day. It eventually goes away, but not always. Bright sunlight can also trigger it; when I step outside into intense light, my eyes suddenly hurt and need a few minutes to adjust.

I smoked cigarettes, drank a lot of coffee, and often had Red Bull Zero on an empty stomach. During that period, I had serious stomach issues — constant bloating, cramps, and pain. Almost every meal caused diarrhea, and my stool was in bad condition. Sometimes I stopped eating at work altogether because of it, only eating after coming home — usually around 6 or 9 p.m., depending on my shift. My diet at that time was also very poor.

I believe all of that was the result of a poor lifestyle and being too focused on my career.

Last November, I went to a gastroenterologist and was diagnosed with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and mild inflammation in my intestines. A year has passed since then, and my stomach has improved a lot — it’s not perfect yet, but much better than before.

However, my eyes still don’t work like they used to.
For example, just yesterday, I stayed home all day, then went for a short 5-minute drive as a passenger to buy groceries in the evening — it was dark outside, and my eyes quickly became tired, red, and painful again.

It’s also important to mention that my work was always stressful. I had to lead a team, handle customer complaints and escalations, deal with economic pressure, react quickly, attend meetings, and ensure my coworkers were happy — all while dealing with criticism from my supervisor. Despite everything, I actually liked my job.

But one major issue was the lighting. The LED lights in the office were far too bright, and from day one, I started getting migraines and headaches. I even tried blue-light filter glasses, but they didn’t help much. The air quality in the office was also terrible — suffocating, with too little oxygen. Even customers complained about it.

Now for the second important part:
I have no issues reading a book or doing things at home, like cooking or cleaning. Walking or riding my bike is also fine — I never have eye problems then.

Using my phone or laptop for a long time doesn’t affect my eyes either.

One trick I discovered: when I’m in a car or on public transport, if I focus on a still point — like the floor, ceiling, or my phone — my eyes stay relaxed and normal. But if I look outside and try to focus on the moving scenery or concentrate too hard on the road, my eyes get triggered badly.

The same happens in darker rooms or crowded places. I even tried attending a music concert once, and my eyes hurt badly afterward.

Finally, I don’t take any medication now. Unfortunately, no eye doctor has been able to help me. They said I only have mild dry eyes, which is almost normal.

I use Celluvisc 1% eye drops (containing carmellose sodium) and a vitamin A ointment at night before sleep.

The supplements I take daily (since being diagnosed with IBS) are:

Vitamin C and Iron

Vitamin B complex

Zinc

Magnesium Glycinat

Omega-3 (650 mg EPA and 440 mg DHA)

Vitamin A (1000 µg daily)

Vitamin K2 (200 µg daily)

Vitamin D3 (50–125 µg daily)

Electrolytes

Probiotics for IBS and Fiber like  Indian Psyllium Husks

L-Glutamine and Collagen

I usually sleep between 6–8 hours per night. I don't smoke cigarettes over 16 months, don't do drugs. And drink no alcohol.

Any help or advice would mean a lot. I’ve been dealing with this for over 18 months now, and I just want to do the things I love again and enjoy my life to the fullest.

Thank you!

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1o7h4iw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7h4iw,Sensitive Michael - Voice Notes and “depends on the guy” - Part 3,"Now that Michael has the all important info such as Charlotte’s fake middle name, he starts using it as if it were a title.  But anyway, how was your night?  I hate this question.  I slept!

And another pet peeve - have you had your coffee and breakfast?  One - I don’t drink coffee.  Tea, maybe.  But never coffee.  I hate it how they assume that everyone drinks it and wonder why you don’t.  Second, I seldom eat breakfast and they always hit you on that.  Why not?  Enough questions about my eating and drinking habits!

I tell him I was at work which I was, and he excuses himself.  Not knowing how the working day goes and that they are typically 8 hours long, he hits me up at almost 2 asking me how’s my day.  I ghost him until I am really off work, but wanted another excuse to avoid him.  I was at the casino!  I saw that tried on another bait so I decided to try it myself to see if he wanted to claim my winnings.  Even though Charlotte tells him she is at the slots, he wants to ask more about her brother.  🤦‍♀️

Where does he live?  What a compelling question!  Now it’s about Charlotte’s kids, his brother in Sacramento and his daughter and granddaughter in New York.  Oddly all this talk about family leads to love confessions.  Definitely to set the stage for the scam, but it was an odd pivot.  Charlotte reminds him that it can’t be love at first sight since they have never met, but he remains unconvinced.  Her beauty is within and he needs to get to know more about her.  But based on whatever little he does know, boy does he sure love Charlotte!

So what does he want to know more about?  Charlotte’s family of course?  Are her parents alive?  Where does she spend Christmas?  He of course is from Albania and mentions his brother in Sacramento for the third or fourth time.

Where do your parents live, Charlotte?  

Are you planning on visiting them?  Oh yes, this Nigerian man would love to visit them some day.  

Next we speak about Charlotte’s dating history, so I find a way to bring up Kelvin.  It doesn’t have the desired effect and it stalls.  Michael reiterates his continued desire for Charlotte, even to the point of marriage.  Full stop there.  She’s not getting married and whether or not she dates someone depends on the guy.  This irritated him for some reason.  Must be something lost in translation.  

Next morning he gets off to a quick start and tries to set a firm time for Charlotte and him to speak.  The time after work for me is not a time I typically like to spend with scammers so we go back and forth about how long it will take for Charlotte to get home.  

What’s your first language?  Uhm, English?  Well he was born and raised in Tirana Albania and he also happens to speak Tirana Albania.  Charlotte attempts to school him that he should know that Tirana is a city, not a language.  His English isn’t great and he tells me which Albanian dialects he speaks.  

Also:  Do you have WhatsApp?  Yet another attempt to get my phone number.  This guy won’t stop!

Michael is angry about something I said (“depends on the guy”) and wants to call me.  Since he seems to be so angry about it, I’d rather he text me.  I do something I don’t ordinarily do and leave a voice note.  “What are you so angry about?”.  Charlotte said her love “depends on the guy” and he immediately assumed it wouldn’t be him.  In all fairness, he has much to be worried about.  

But Charlotte’s pic has drawn him to true love.  Does he feel the same way about porn stars?  Does he love them based on their looks?  When he continues about my pic, I leave him with another voice note:  “It’s pretty fucking creepy that you fell in love with my pic”.

He admits this and tries to normalize it.  It’s all about the beauty within.  That’s why my pic makes him go so crazy!  He explains that Charlotte’s pic led him to love on Scrabble.  It was her and only her!  What would have happened if Charlotte declined his game request?

Sick of all this talk, Charlotte invites him to North Carolina.  Here’s where the Yahoo Boy kicks in: not so fast dear.  He needs to get to know me before he flies to meet me.  He’s content in telling me how much he loves Charlotte but won’t bother to accept an invite to meet in person!  It’s like having a teen girl with Johnny Depp posters all over her wall getting a personal invite from Johnny to meet up.  “Not so fast, Mr Depp!  I need to get to know you first!”.

Seeing the silliness of this perhaps, Michael promises to come after he finishes his contract in Turkey.  He’ll get a hotel.  Or… directly to Charlotte’s place?  Naw - hotel, you creep. But he lives in Tulsa!  Won’t I relocate?  (Probably feeling me out to see how attached I am to where I live in case he ever tells me where he really is).  

After telling him she is happy where she is and is not moving, Michael calls Charlotte rude.  

“Why are you like that?”

He didn’t like how Charlotte said “forget about it” when he was farting around with the invite to North Carolina.  She holds his feet to the fire about telling her to take it slow and not rush the meeting.

This bait is not long for this world as his insistence for Charlotte’s phone number will be his undoing.",6,1760548681.0,scambait,2,1.0,False

I have a toddler and I miss my coffee. I’m not convinced the caffeine and acidic foods have anything to do with it. We were actually traveling recently too and ran out of his meds and for a few days he went right back to how he used to be with all the symptoms and not eating well and obviously upset and uncomfortable. Once we got him back on track with meds, hes fine again. So is there anything backing my pediatricians suggestion of cutting these things out? I should also say Id love to see any research to show my husband- hes not sure about me adding these things back in until the 3 months mark even though I dont think it will make a difference.

1o7h2v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1o7h2v5/explore_if_the_varathane_wood_stain_marker_really/,Explore If the Varathane Wood Stain Marker Really Hides Scratches,"Varathane 215361 Wood Stain Touch-Up Marker arrived on my doorstep as a potential game-changer for all the nicked, scratched, and blemished wooden surfaces that silently judge me every day. Testing this little marker with its ""Dark Walnut/Espresso"" color was equal parts curiosity and necessity. It's marketed as an easy, one-step solution for repairing wood furniture, cabinets, floors, and even DIY craft projects. My experience? Pretty close to the promise, but not without a few quirks.

**Convenient Design and Portability**  
The first thing I appreciated was its compact size. At 2.4 ounces and shaped like your everyday marker, it fit perfectly in the tool drawer without eating up space. No fumbling with tubs of stain or messy brushes here. Its felt tip is precise enough to target small scratches without spreading color beyond where needed. This feature made touching up wooden trims and floorboards not just doable but oddly satisfying. You get to feel like you’re coloring in a grown-up coloring book.

**Effortless Application**  
Using the touch-up marker felt intuitive from the get-go. I tested it on an old coffee table that had suffered years of abuse from keys, mugs, and the occasional poorly-placed laptop. All you have to do is press the tip gently against the scratch, give it a few strokes, and just like that, the scratches started blending in. The stain dries rapidly—in about 30 minutes—which means you can fix those unsightly blemishes and move on with life before you lose patience.

[Check Varathane 215361 price on Amazon.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b000i1qgfo/)

**Upsides**  
- Simple to use even for non-DIY experts.  
- Precision felt-tip means you don’t accidentally stain undamaged areas, especially handy for nooks or grooves.  
- Dries quickly, leaving a natural wood tone without looking too artificial.  
- Compact and portable—easy to store or grab for emergency touch-ups.  

**Color Matching Accuracy**  
Dark Walnut/Espresso is a gorgeous, rich shade, and I’ll give it credit where due—it worked well on most wooden features in my house. The blending is fairly seamless on darker finishes, and in many cases, you wouldn’t pick out the imperfections unless you’re actively looking for them. However, I couldn't completely ignore that it only matches a specific color group. If your surface is even slightly lighter or red-toned, the patch might stick out a bit. It’s not an exact science, so not all wood finishes will walk away looking perfect.

**Drawbacks**  
- Limited to specific shades—doesn’t work well on lighter, yellowish woods like oak or pine.  
- Might require a second application for deeper scratches, which could slightly darken the spot further.  
- While compact, felt-tip markers like this can dry out if left unused for too long.  

**Product Alternatives**  
Though the touch-up marker is a great pick for minor household fixes, there are plenty of competitors out there. Brands like Rejuvenate and Minwax offer wood repair kits and markers in assorted colors. They give you more flexibility in color-matching, especially if your furniture isn’t a perfect walnut-toned espresso. On the flip side, they don’t always deliver the same smooth application experience, and some need multiple products to achieve the same result you get here in one step. The Varathane marker definitely wins for people who want simple, quick fixes without an arts-and-crafts session.

**Cost Efficiency**  
This marker sits comfortably in the ""quick fix, low investment"" category. For the price, it does the job of sprucing up your furniture without forcing you to splurge on a professional solution. Compared to the cost and effort involved in sanding, staining, and sealing wood manually, this tool is priceless in terms of time saved. Think of it as the smart option for anyone who wants to patch things up without overthinking—or overspending.

Context: My boyfriend is not at all a scenthound, however, he does enjoy scented candles and wearing cologne for special occasions. His favorite notes include coffee, vanilla, woods, and musk. He does not like gourmands, as you'll see.

Maybe unnecessary context - we are both bisexual men.

**Match Made in Heaven** by Sorce

* *Matcha, vanilla soft serve, cherry blossom, almond, waffle cone, powdered sugar, creamy sandalwood*
* BF: This is fine. It doesn't bother me or give me a headache at all. But if I smelled it, I wouldn't want to take you home necessarily, you know?
* Me: OK, I need to know what the take-you-home scents are.

**Moon Bathing** by Cirrus Parfum

* *Lychee fruit, milk, vanilla, jasmine grandiflorum, salt*

* BF: Mmm. Yes. Take you home.
* Me: Compare it to the one just before. The pink one?

**Achilles and Patroclus** by Big Gay Collective

* *pomegranate, vanilla, musk, jasmine, Asian sandalwood, golden amber*
* BF: Mmm. Love this one. Definitely take you home
* BF: (half an hour later, unsolicited, after I shared all the scent names with him) I really like the Achilles and Patroclus one. It smells so good.
* Me: They make soap, room sprays, and candles too. If they make a soap of this I'd get it.
* BF: Yessss.

**Twink** by Big Gay Collective

* *Blood orange, Black currant, White tea, Jasmine*
* BF: (immediately recoiled)
* Me: Too strong?
* BF: Is this that new one you ordered recently called Twink?
* Me: HOW DID YOU KNOW (i'm a twink btw)
* BF: It's too bright and loud. Bordering on a headache. Classic twink. I would not take this one home.

**Crimson Kashmir Deux** by Nocturne Alchemy

* *Crimson: A single note with accents given to enhance. A pure Egyptian Red Musk is a skin musk that envelopes the wearer in a sheer, deep, and aromatic scent that binds with the natural warmth of the skin and is very alluring on the skin.  The colour is a rich, vibrant red from the Red Musk petals used during the perfume process.  Apply sparingly to enjoy the natural colour of the red musk petals.*
* *Kashmir: Deep blood red musk. A scent that is both animalistic (vegan) and ethereal once it blends into the chemistry of your skin. This perfume is a viscous, deep blood-red colour due to the nature of the components used to create such a beautifully haunting perfume.*
* BF: Yes, yes. It's similar to the last one.
* Me: I'm proud of you! yes it is!
* BF: I like these. Buy you dinner, take you home.

* BF: No, I do like it.

**Cotton Candy Kashmir Crimson Marshmallow Musk** by Nocturne Alchemy

* *Cotton Candy accord, Bastet’s Musk, SLO Crimson Red Musk, SLO Kashmir Red Musk, Vanilla Marshmallow, Strawberry, French Vanilla, and Raspberry Seed.*
* BF: Yeah, I like the thing these last several ones have had in common.
* Me: Red musk.
* BF: Yeah, I love that musk. It's giving 9pm, you're sitting at the bar in a sexy outfit, and I'm fascinated.
* Me: I actually like wearing these at 9am on the commuter train.
* BF: Everyone's wondering, ""Why does that guy smell so sexy?""

**Turyin** by Stone & Wit

* *Pomegranate, plums, sandalwood, gunpowder*
* BF: I like this!
* Me: I am VERY surprised. This one is pretty strong to me. And more medicinal than sensual. In fact, my favorite fruity blend was the one you hated (The Devil).
* BF: No, this is kind of light to me, and interesting. I'd take you home.

**Ashara** by Stone & Wit

* *Nilgiri tea, black ink, white agar, palm dates*
* BF: Yes, I'd take you home
* Me: Once again, I am surprised...it's just so unlike the previous take-you-home fragrances. It does not strike me as sexy at all.

**Her Skirt is Stars** by Stone & Wit

* *Chili pepper, dark chocolate, mezcal, labdanum, vanilla*
* BF: Take you home immediately.
* Me: Fascinating, again this one is quite different. It's kind of strong and masculine.

* *Decadent chocolate. Dark Chocolate absolute, Black Star, Black Diamond, Rich Cocoa, Essential oils of Cacao bean and a kiss of Black Vanilla entraptured in a tomb of Ambre Ombre: Perfume Attar of Rare Black Amber, Black Patchouli, Black Frankincense and Black Myrrh.*

* Me: Yeah haha

**And How!** by Nocturne Alchemy (RIS, no longer available)

* *Lavender Crème, Marshmallow Crème, Kashmir Red Musk, Vanilla essence, African Vanilla Bean and French Lavender*
* BF: Ooooh sexy. Take you home.
* Me: Really?? You hate lavender. And it's a bit strong.
* BF: Oh I wasn't getting any lavender. It just smells deceptively innocent? Like you look innocent but actually you're sexy and kinky.

\------------------------------

**Overall:**

* Fun to discover my boyfriend and I both LOVE NAVA's Kashmir! i'll definitely be getting the Kashmir limited releases for future collections.
* He does NOT like chocolate! I've been hunting for my perfect chocolate scent and haven't found her yet.
* He DOES like florals (esp jasmine) balanced with warm or spiced notes.
* Surprisingly, he was meh on one of my faves, Match Made in Heaven! and surprising he loved the Stone & Wit samples I've been testing. I like them but don't plan to FS - they're very interesting but also quite strong and pull a bit medicinal on me.
* I now know to wear Moon Bathing, Maravilla, or one of my Kashmir blends around him if he's down.

Next up - I'm aiming to get some Friend scent reviews next time I have friends over! And BF is going to reviewing any new scents I get, of course.",12,1760548542.0,Indiemakeupandmore,6,1.0,False

Ghee, often referred to as ""butter ghee,"" is one of the most versatile and functional fats you can have in your kitchen. If you’ve ever wondered [what is butter ghee used for](https://www.lazizgold.com/), the answer is rooted in its unique structure as a clarified fat, which makes it superior to many other cooking oils and butters. From savory main courses to healthy diet hacks, ghee deserves a permanent spot in your daily routine.

**Beyond the Pan: How to Use Ghee for Health and Flavor**

The question of what is ghee used for extends well beyond simple frying. Its high smoke point and rich nutrient profile offer numerous applications. Here’s a detailed guide on how to use ghee:

1. **Ideal for High-Heat Applications:** Due to its impressive 485∘F smoke point, ghee is perfect for all forms of high-heat cooking. Use it for stir-frying, deep-frying, and searing meats and vegetables, ensuring a stable, safe cooking environment without the risk of oxidation.
2. **Flavoring and Finishing:** A simple drizzle of warm ghee over rice, steamed greens, or lentil stews (dal) adds a signature nutty aroma and buttery richness. This technique is often used in fine dining to enhance the final presentation and taste.
3. **Dairy-Free Spread:** Replace regular butter on toast, pancakes, or baked goods with ghee. Since the lactose and casein are removed, it offers a dairy-free way to enjoy a buttery texture and flavor.
4. **Bulletproof Beverages:** Adding ghee to your morning coffee or tea provides sustained energy, helps with satiety, and is a popular method for incorporating healthy fats into ketogenic or paleo diets.

Understanding what is butter ghee used for allows you to leverage its benefits fully.

**Conclusion**

Ghee is an indispensable fat that excels in both flavor and function. Whether you are looking for the best way to cook at high temperatures or seeking a healthier dietary fat, ghee is the clear choice. For guaranteed purity, authenticity, and convenience, skip the home-clarification process. We recommend relying on a trusted brand like La-ziz Gold to bring premium, high-quality ghee into your kitchen.",1,1760548517.0,u_IndividualFormal128,0,1.0,False

I’m using the same beans, and made 2 espressos to calibrate it. Now the barista assist can swing from a recommended grind for a single shot from 21 right down to 10. It will stay at a recommended size for a couple of drinks and then drop dramatically, before flying back up 10 grind sizes again. 

Espresso pour speed is extremely erratic too, they either drip out over the space of about 20 seconds, or the whole thing can be done within 5 seconds. 

I have single shots as a double is a bit much for me, this is my first coffee machine and I’m absolutely overwhelmed and have no idea how to get consistent results with it.

​In a city perpetually veiled in rain and neon glow, a reserved young man and an artist are drawn together by quiet chance encounters in a local cafe, only to find their budding, silent love story threatened by her imminent, unavoidable departure to another country.
​Synopsis (Detailed Scene & Plot Breakdown)
​Act I: The Silent Connection
​The story opens in a moody, rain-soaked city, establishing a tone of ethereal urban melancholy. KAIZEN (late 20s, tall, introspective), dressed in a black trench coat, arrives at a quaint, old-world cafe. Inside, he first sees AURELIA (late 20s, shy, artistic), sketching by a window, bathed in the soft, flickering light of a sudden rumble of thunder. Their eyes meet in slow motion—a moment of instant, silent recognition—but Aurelia quickly retreats into her sketchbook, establishing her introverted nature.
​Their first exchange is prompted by a mundane accident: the kindly old cafe owner spills coffee. Aurelia offers a tissue, leading to an awkward but meaningful first conversation about the rain, which Kaizen poetically calls the ""most fitting weather.""
​The act concludes with a crucial thematic beat: the two separate without exchanging names. The Voice Over states: ""Sometimes, knowing a name... lessens the feeling that comes with the first meeting."" This establishes their relationship as one built purely on emotion, proximity, and shared silence, rather than conventional romance.
​Act II: Moments of Ephemeral Joy
​The relationship develops through a series of atmospheric, almost accidental meetings. They share the same interests, signaled when Aurelia is found holding the unique storybook Kaizen was searching for in an old library.
​Their core connection is revealed in Scene 7, where they walk together through the wet streets, their surroundings blurring as their focus remains on each other. Aurelia shares her sketchbook, filled with lonely nature drawings and, notably, a sketch of Kaizen alone in the rain—confirming she was captivated from the start.
​The Unique Scene that defines their hope is the Rooftop Scene (Scene 8). Aurelia takes Kaizen to her favorite old rooftop, overlooking the sparkling city. Kaizen folds and flies a Paper Plane, to which Aurelia whispers the film's first major piece of hope: ""If it falls down... we will meet again.""
​The first major crisis arrives when a sudden heavy rain forces them to shelter at a bus stop. Kaizen gives Aurelia his trench coat to keep her warm—a silent, symbolic act of protection. The scene ends with Aurelia rushing home, unconsciously taking the coat with her—a symbol of their intertwined lives and the unintentional nature of their bond. The audience knows their relationship has become serious, yet the underlying dread persists.
​Act III: The Inevitable Farewell
​The brief period of happiness is shown in a Montage of cafe dates and library sessions, but it is abruptly cut short when Aurelia begins to pull away, missing a date due to a family obligation and sending a text later that night that is deeply saddening and deceptively final.
​The emotional climax begins in Scene 17 when Kaizen wakes to no message from Aurelia, followed by intense anxiety. His fear is confirmed when he finds her diary at his gate, with a final, heartbreaking note: ""If you are reading this... I will always remember you... Take care of yourself.""
​Kaizen frantically searches the city's symbolic locations (rooftop, bus stop) before finally finding her in the old, empty Park (Scene 18). She is huddled on a bench next to a suitcase. When he places his coat on her shoulders again, she breaks, hugging him while confessing the truth: her father is forcing her to move to Korea for studies, and she may never be able to return.
​The Climactic Farewell (Scene 19) occurs in a light rain at the bus station. They sit under the canopy, their hands tightly held, as Aurelia rests her head on his shoulder. They acknowledge their relationship is a season that must change. Their hands slowly loosen as she boards the bus, which drives away into the night, leaving Kaizen alone.
​The film concludes days later on the Rooftop. A sad, empty Kaizen looks out over the city. A light rain begins, and then, inexplicably, he sees a PAPER PLANE spinning down toward the street, perfectly echoing Aurelia's wish. He runs down, finds the plane, but the hopeful symbolism is instantly crushed by the bleak reality of his situation. He looks up at the empty rooftop.",1,1760548372.0,bollywood,3,1.0,False

### Training 
28yo female runner, just under 5'0 and 108lbs. I ran my first marathon at the JTBC Seoul Marathon last November and finished in 3:51:27 following the NRC plan. I did stop around the 35k mark in that race to help my boyfriend so I don't know what time I would've finished with if I had kept going. Took a week off and focused on maintaining my base, then started pfitz 12/55 in December for the Tokyo Marathon in March 2025 and finished in 3:48:37. Between March and July I ran two trail races and a 10k, and ran anywhere from 30-50km/week. Finally, I started this most recent training block in July following pftiz 12/55 again and finished in 3:28:34 at the Chicago Marathon. 

I missed a lot of miles in July due to traveling and preparing to move back to the US in early August. But I made up for it and hit 51.7, 55.3, 54.3, and 48 miles at my peak. I did a significant amount of runs in the high 70s-low 80s because I'm not an early bird and it prepared me well, I didn't feel hot at all while running in Chicago.

### Pre-race
I arrived in Chicago a week before the race and stayed with my friend who was also running the marathon. Tuesday - easy 10km run, Wednesday - 4.6km warm-up, 3mi @ MP track workout, 1.3km cool down, Saturday - 5k shakeout run. I'm very adamant about not drinking alcohol (only have 1-2 drinks during the entire block) or coffee  (stop 2 weeks before the race for better quality sleep). In the week leading up to the race I woke up around 6-6:30am, drank a Trevi hydration stick first thing in the morning and estimated my carb-load as follows: Thursday (390g), Friday (350g), Saturday (around 300g, got busy and didn't eat as much). 

Saturday night I was asleep by 9:30pm, woke up at 4:30am, immediately downed a pint of OJ, had a plain bagel with a smidge of jam, and a banana. I didn't drink any more liquids past 6:00am, I've had bathroom troubles in the past where I always need to pee during a race, either due to over-hydrating or nerves. We arrived downtown around 6:40am, luckily my friend was running with a charity so we were able to use the bathroom at their tent and avoid the long lines. We stretched while we waited for about 20min. Finally, I headed to corral F, got rid of my throwaway sweater and waited. As we walked up to the starting line, I eventually got between the 3:30 and 3:25 pace groups.

### Race
I set my Coros watch to a target run with the full marathon distance (42.2km) and time goal of 3:30:00 (4'58 min/km or 7:59 min/mi avg) and hit start as soon as I crossed the starting line. I read about the GPS issues at Chicago and knew I started out too fast, I dialed back to keep my pace between 4'50-5'00 min/km (7'47-8'03 mi/min). 

The course was shady and I was feeling good, around the 8-10km mark I spotted a 3:30 pacer in front of me and caught up to him. For the next 10km or so, I stayed steady running next to him and by mile 10 I knew 3:30 was in reach. The pacer would catch back up to me whenever he veered off to the aid stations which I thought was funny because I was trying to follow his time. I lost him around 20km when he fell behind as we crossed a bridge. I was locked in throughout most of the race, focusing only on the feet of the person in front of me and didn't pay much attention to the crowd support. 

However, I realized that my watch was 0.50km ahead when I started noticing the mile and km markers on the course weren't matching up with my watch around mile 13. I panicked a bit and resolved to keep under 5'00 min/km no matter what for the rest of the race and started going based off my total run time as I approached each marker. I hit mile 20 at 2:40:33 (2:37:13 on my watch) and sped up my pace to under 4'50 min/km.  Surprisingly I didn't feel any cramping in my hamstrings or glutes like in the previous marathons I ran, however, my knees were starting to feel strained as they always do on runs longer than 28km. I did stub my toe crossing the final bridge because a girl had fallen and I tried to avoid falling myself. Around the 37km mark, I saw the 3:30 pacer I was with earlier and thought his time was off or that he started in a different corral so I surged past him. 

Once I saw the mile 24 marker, I knew I had to give it everything I had to break 3:30. My watch read 3:10:33 at 38km, just 2.2 more miles and I had 20min left to hit my goal. I anticipated the uphill in the final mile, saw the 800m, 400m, 300m and 200m signs on the course and reminded myself that I've ran up mountains bigger than this hill. My watch beeped indicating that I had completed 42.2km in 3:25 but the finish line was still in front of me. I sprinted to the finish and saw the clock time was around 3:29 after I crossed and stopped my watch. I was hyperventilating and cried a bit as I walked up to get my medal. 

During the race, I only grabbed water maybe 5 times because I didn't want to risk having the urge to pee. I didn't use any of the Gatorade or Maurten gels on course since I never trained with them. I nibbled on a sliced banana before chucking it. I felt okay and not too thirsty. I took 1 gel around 8km, 16km, 24km, 32km and forced myself to get half a honey stinger down between 35-37km.

### Post-race
Right after crossing the finish I texted my boyfriend who had been sending me messages throughout the race. My official time was 3:28:34 and I felt so much relief. I waited for any pain to hit me but was relatively okay, got some biofreeze on my calves and gatorade at the medical tent and was good to do. 

I finally got my redemption after failing to hit 3:30 at Tokyo, I never wrote a race report for that but there were several factors outside of my control. It's been a rough past couple of months, after living abroad for 4 years and moving back to the US in August with no job lined up. I already knew I wanted to take a break from working, but still felt lost and uncertain about my future. I'm really hard on myself even when I know I'm capable of reaching a goal for fear of failure. It already happened at Tokyo and I lost a lot of confidence in myself. Since I had no job or other time commitments for the past 2 months, I tried to reframe this newfound freedom as my chance to focus on my running and give it everything I had. All the tears, negative thoughts, and self-doubt were just in my head all along. I don't have another marathon lined up which feels weird since I only had 4 months between my first two, but I know that I want to do it again soon and hopefully BQ in a year's time. I also want to work on my mental health and frame not only running but all my goals in a more positive way. I need to stop telling myself that I'm not good enough and give myself more gratitude and appreciation for my accomplishments. If you took the time to read this all, thank you so much and I hope some of my words or experiences can resonate with you!

I'm currently in the process of tapering my caffeine intake and I've noticed today that I craved buying something with chocolate in it. 

It doesn't make sense to me, because the caffeine in the chocolate pieces of cookies should only be a very small amount. Still I especially crave chocolate, not coffee or anything. In the past I noticed this also several times during a taper. 

I don't even eat much chocolate in general, so this is even more weird.

* I chose this pic because it reminds me of the relationship I have with my daughter. My own mother was non-maternal and I'm still convinced that she doesn't know me or like me that much. I tried desperately to create a different relationship with my kids. Perhaps I relate to Lorelai a bit. 
* In the opening, Lane's excitement over her brand new CD takes me back to high school. Before streaming it was totally like that!
* My parents were ALWAYS late so Rory's freakout at possibly being late hits me deep.
* Emily being in the headmaster's office - I would have been pretty mad about this, along with the fact that Emily is still correcting her publicly. Again, I see parallels to my own life. My dad treating me like I'm 8 years old when I'm 40 pisses me off to no end.  Emily is being a passive aggressive martyr here. In real life, I avoid people like that
* Charleston is the opposite of welcoming. 
* Emily offering to buy Rory uniforms and trying to pay for internet is a sweet gesture and Lorelai should have accepted it. Emily is trying really hard to be involved with Rory and Lorelai is being VERY stubborn. That said, Lorelai is setting a boundary and her mother should respect it even if she disagrees with it. 
* Wow Paris is the worst from the beginning
* Tristan is giving Dahmer vibes
* Luke was totally waiting for the girls to come inside the diner at the end of the episode. He walks outside, sees them walk away, and flips the sign to closed.

Used Claude AI to create [noncow.com](http://noncow.com) \- a 6-question quiz that matches people with their perfect dairy alternative.

**The idea:** Friends kept asking ""which plant milk should I try?"" so I made a quiz that considers their use case (coffee, cereal, cooking), taste preferences, dietary restrictions, and values (sustainability, nutrition, budget).

**The journey:**

* Built the first version in a weekend
* Posted to r/vegan and r/dairyfree over the weekend
* Got 8k+ views and 58 comments with real feedback
* This morning updated the quiz based on user complaints:
   * Added multiple selection for milk uses (people use milk for more than one thing!)
   * Changed generic ""allergen-free"" to specific allergen checkboxes (soy, oats, nuts, coconut)
   * Added ""no strong preference"" option

**The tech:** Just HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Amazon affiliate links. Kept it simple for my first project. Claude helped write the code, but I learned by tinkering and asking questions.

**Results so far:**

* 162 users first week
* 20 Amazon clicks (12% CTR)
* First affiliate sale: $1.69 (someone bought a kids' winter jacket after clicking my oat milk link 😂)
* Real engagement and feedback from Reddit

**What I learned:**

* Shipping beats perfecting
* User feedback > my assumptions
* AI tools make the ""I can't code"" excuse obsolete
* Building in public is nerve-wracking but valuable

Victor Stone slowly sipped the hot coffee; its lumpy, ceramic mug was difficult to hold but had its own comfort and charm to him. It was still early on the cool fall Saturday, and yet the little hole in the wall coffee store was already packed full of people trying to get their morning fill. He discovered this place just a few months ago when he moved back to Detroit for his job but was pretty sure it wasn’t here while he was in high school. But he wasn’t fully sure. Sometimes a place that never made it onto your radar becomes relevant and then you wonder how you had gone your entire life without seeing it.

Vic managed to get a table for two just by the entrance. It was an old, rickety, wicker table that looked like it belonged on someone’s patio more than a coffee shop and the draft from the nonstop rhythmic “click, clunk” of the opening and closing of the door made it an uncomfortable position to be in. 

And yet, somehow, when it was her walking through the door, it might as well have been a beautiful sunny day. She wore a dark blue hoodie with matching jeans, her hair pulled back into a messy braid. She scanned the crowded room, looking for someone and then her face lit up when she saw him sitting just a few feet in front of her.

She sat down across from him and he slid a cup of coffee over to her, which she grabbed and took a long drink from.

“Morning, Donna.”

“Morning, Vic. How’s your week been?” 

“It’s been great. I think I’m finally starting to get into the rhythm of work life. I dunno, kinda reminds me a lot of gradeschool, which I guess is probably the point. Just kind of that, plus having to be the one doing all the chores gets to be a lot sometimes. But it’s nice to finally be really on my own, y’know?”

Donna nodded, taking another drink. “Yeah, kinda? I don’t really feel any different, I guess. Just sorta moved all the time I put into school into work now. And the rest is just free time. Feels weird to actually have some for the first time in four years but also feels strange to not have the next step… there if that makes sense.”

“I get that. Going from one goal to another to another along that path just to be.. Done with all that. I don't really know what my next step really is, but I’m okay with that. With all that stuff with Technis [See Cyborg 72-74!]and getting my body back… It’s nice to just take it slow.”

“For sure. How is that? Do you miss your original body, or is the “old” body what you want?”

“This is me, for sure. It’s what I’m happy and comfortable with and the body I can do the most good with. But I won’t pretend that the old body didn’t have its pros. It was nice to be able to walk down the street and not have everyone look at me. But also… I want to help people. And sure, I can help people with my original body too. But ultimately, the world needs heroes. I can be that guy too.”

Vic hastily sipped his coffee, a little embarrassed at what he just said in public. But Donna didn’t seem to mind.

“Yeah, I agree. How’s it been since you got your powers back? Any big action?”

“No, thankfully. Just been taking some time to get the muscle memory back and get back into the groove so that I’m ready when I’m needed.”

Donna nodded. “So, I take it you haven’t seen this then?”

She slid her phone across the table to Vic. The screen showed a picture of a sleek, jet black motorcycle helmet with an LED screen on the front of it where the person’s face would be.

“No? Who’s that?”

“He goes by ‘X’ and he’s a streamer. Still pretty small time but growing *rapidly*. I stumbled upon him after another streamer I watch mentioned him since he’s also in the Detroit area. He’s got a pretty unique set up. The first night he mentions a couple of places he wants to hit, then chat picks which one to do and a method for doing it. Then, a couple days later, he streams him breaking in and stealing whatever chat said, how they said to do it.”

“That’s… concerning. What kind of stuff are we talking?”

“Here’s the weird part. I don’t really know. He doesn’t save the videos and I can’t find anyone reporting on it. But I saw him steal a painting from the art museum on stream and the next day, it’s conveniently “out for research”. It was too real looking and it’d be too much of a coincidence if it just happened to be gone. But yet, it’s not reported stolen for some reason. I dunno, what do you think?”

Vic thought for a moment. “It’s weird for sure. But coincidences do happen. Any idea when he streams?”

“One sec… His page says he’s streaming again tonight, 10 PM.”

“Wanna come over and watch it? After that, we could probably decide whether it’s real and where to go from there.”

“Yeah, that sounds great!” Donna said instantly, not playing it off as coolly as she thought.

“Cool, sounds like a plan. Want to come over at like, 9:00 and hang out for a bit in case he starts early?”

She nodded. “Sounds good. I’ll see what else I can find about him in the meantime. He's a streamer, there has to be something else out there.”



⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙

It turns out, nothing else was out there. Donna scoured the internet for any other mentions of X, but it was not an easy thing to search for, especially when it seemed like he didn’t want to be found.  She searched high and low for any mention of him but it just didn’t exist. He had no social media beyond his streaming account, no fan pages, no video clips, nothing. And yet, somehow, he had almost a million followers on his account.

Donna rubbed her forehead, frustrated. She’d spent all afternoon and evening looking around without a single thing to show for it. She powered off her laptop and looked over at her phone. 7:52. Too early to head to Vic’s, but too late to really start doing something important. 

She walked over to her coach and plopped down on it and pulled out her phone. At least she had enough time to start to relax a little bit.



⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙

Vic looked nervously over at the clock, 8:59. She’d be here any moment. He had ordered some pizza in part for himself and in part to share but it was already room temperature at best since it arrived very early. He thought about turning on the oven but shook that thought off. It was too late anyway. She’d be here any moment. Or maybe she was running late? That’d give him some time… 

**BUZZ!** **BUZZ!** His phone went off with the notification that Donna was at the door. He buzzed her in then stepped into the hallway to meet her. 

After a few moments, she was there. “Hey, good to see you,” he said.

“Heh, you too.” 

He showed her into his place and Donna looked around, impressed. This was the first time she’d been here since Vic got his own place in the city after graduating. His apartment was a cozy place with a small living room and attached kitchen with a half wall between them. Each of those two rooms had another one attached to it, the kitchen leading to the bathroom and the living room to his bedroom. The apartment was lightly decorated with some posters of sports memorabilia but it felt tastefully minimal instead of sparse. A cheap couch sat on one end of the living room with a large TV on the far side and a coffee table with the cold pizza between them.

Vic walked over to the kitchen to grab coupe plates and handed one to Donna, who was setting her backpack down on the floor next to the couch.

“I got some pizza, but it got here really early so I don’t know how hot it’ll be. So sorry about that.”

Donna shrugged. “I won’t complain too much.”

Vic started to get the TV ready but as he did, he said, “Did you find anything else about X?”

“Nothing. Which is almost more suspicious. What kind of remotely popular streamer doesn’t have any social media? Or a single channel posting highlight videos? It just doesn’t make sense.”

“Unless he doesn't want much attention? You said he was streaming his crimes. Can’t imagine many platforms would allow that if they really knew what he was doing”

“You’d be surprised. Clicks are clicks after all.”

“I guess.” 

Vic flipped the TV onto one of his favorite streamers, who was playing a new puzzle game that just released. 

“Have you heard of this game? I haven’t played it yet, but it seems really cool.”

“No, but I saw someone play it yesterday, can’t remember who I was watching. But yeah, looked really interesting when…”


⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙

Donna and Vic continued to enjoy the night together, laughing and trying to solve the puzzles along with the streamer as they made their way through the game. Any talk of X had long been forgotten, at least until Donna got the notification on her phone that he was live.  Vic quickly flipped the stream over to him.

It hadn't really started yet but was instead on some sort of pre-stream loading screen. It was a starry sky with X’s motorcycle helmet in the center of the screen. The LED-visor was showing a looping countdown. 3…2…1… It counted, over and over with white, bold text at the bottom promising that the stream was starting soon.

And in just a few moments, it had. 

X sat in front of a green-screened starry sky, identical to the one on his prestream screen. 

“What’s up everyone, great to see you here tonight.” His voice was put through a synthesizer, giving it a fake, robotics tinge to a pleasant sounding voice.

“I already see the subs rolling in so thanks for that, but as always, it’s not necessary.” 

Vic could see the chat scrolling faster and faster as excitement started to build and more people started to flood into the stream. The number just kept going up, from around 100 people when Vic and Donna joined to now encroaching 5,000 people and was still climbing rapidly. 

“Looking like tonight is going to be one of the biggest streams yet, so thanks to all of you who made your way here. However you found me, I’m glad to see more members of my community. Tonight I’ve got something *reaaally* special for all of you. Or should I say for me?”

He laughed and the LED screen on his helmet turned into a laughing emoji. 

“I’ve got three things for you all to pick between tonight. Voting will start after I've explained them all and will go for a minute or two, so don’t bother spamming anything now. Oh, and don’t forget that you only get one vote. The bot doesn’t care if you send it once or a hundred times.

“Now, first up, the runner up from last time. There’s still a collection of vintage football memorabilia at the Detroit History Museum that’s just *begging* for someone to give it a good home.”

The screen behind him changed to a photo of the museum with footballs and jerseys in glass boxes.

“But if that’s not your speed, I was thinking about getting a new car… or maybe an old one?” 

The screen behind him changed again, this time to a picture of a vintage, 1940s car in a warehouse. 

“This is a vintage, original Model T made in one of the first batches out of the factory that was right here in downtown Detroit. Doubt there’s many of these left and it sure would be fun to drive one…”

“Now, I can already see chat starting to argue about which one of these they’d like to see. And I won’t deny, both of these sound pretty cool. They each have their own challenge and both would be fun to have around. But, sports stuff and cars? I could buy those anywhere. No, what about something truly unique?”

Chat erupted with speculation as they started to wonder what he was referring to. Vic couldn’t even start to read any of it because the messages were flying in far too quickly.

Donna and Vic looked at each other concernedly.

“I’m sure all of you are familiar with Detroit’s hometown hero, Cyborg. But what if I told you that that one of a kind technological miracle might not have to be one of a kind any more? Wouldn’t you like to have your own blaster?”

Vic’s mind started to race. Where was he going with this?

“No picture for this one folks, but I have it from a good source that S.T.A.R. Labs has recreated some of his tech. And folks, I want it. It’d be the challenge of a lifetime, but I think I’m up for it. What about you?”

Vic and Donna each didn’t vote, but a pie chart appeared on X’s helmet screen. It started off even, but S.T.A.R. Labs was quickly over taking the other options until it had a super majority of over 80%.

“Well folks, looks like I’m heading to S.T.A.R.! Hope I can figure out that one. Don’t suppose the public tour takes me down there? No? Well, I’ll find a way. Now, let’s see what the modifiers are for you to choose from…”

The screen displayed a snapping finger emoji and three bullet points appeared in the night sky to the right of X.

Must get caught during the heist
Cannot enter the site beforehand
Must announce the time of the heist

“Oof! Those are some *rough* ones! But remember, just pick one!”

“I think 3? If we want to investigate him, knowing when it was going to happen would be a huge help,” Vic said.

“Agreed. Seems like that’s what chat wants too?”

The pie chart appeared again, but it was far, closer this time. Option 3 had a small plurality, but option 1 was almost equally popular. 

“And time! Wow, close one this time. But, by only 47 votes, option 3! Seems like you guys really like 3s tonight…” 

The screen changed to display a three, but he shook his head and it went away as quickly as it appeared.

“I’ll find some way to announce when I’ll be streaming the heist. Don’t worry about how I’ll do that - you’ll know! But until then… thanks for watching and I’ll see you all when it’s time to start the job!”

As quickly as it started, the stream ended.

Vic grabbed a slice of pizza and started to eat it nervously. 

“Did you know S.T.A.R. had some sort of replica of your powers?”

Vic shook his head. “No. If I had, I probably wouldn’t be happy but I also would’ve asked for some help when I was trying to do that a couple months ago. (see Cyborg 68!) But I don’t think it could be too good of an approximation, not much better than what we made. The Silasium that powers me is just irreplaceable in terms of power output to size ratio.”

“Yeah but no matter what they made, we can’t just let some streamer get a hold of them. I don’t think he’s like, super evil or all that dangerous, but it can’t be a good thing for it to be out there.”

“Agreed. Maybe I’ll head down to S.T.A.R. and talk to them about it. But I’ve got to at least be there when it happens and see where it goes.”

“For sure, for sure,” Donna said, her voice trailing off. “Sooo… now what? Big plans for the night?”

“Umm… no. You?”

She laughed. “You’re asking me, or are you telling me I’m your plans,” she asked coyly.

“How about both?”

“Well, I guess I’m free but I’ll see where the night takes me, y’know?”

“Y’know, now that you mention it, I think I’m in a similar spot. Weird how that works out.”

“Very, very weird,” she agreed. 

“It’s been awhile since we’ve been together like this. Probably when you just moved back? So, you want to start with the classics, then move on to something new?”

“Something new? Gotta admit, I’m intrigued... But, yeah, can’t beat the classics, and you can’t beat me.”

Vic got up and grabbed two controllers, tossing one to her. “Sure, sure… Let’s see if you’re still able to take me. I’m not as rusty as I was last time…”

​In a city perpetually veiled in rain and neon glow, a reserved young man and an artist are drawn together by quiet chance encounters in a local cafe, only to find their budding, silent love story threatened by her imminent, unavoidable departure to another country.
​Synopsis (Detailed Scene & Plot Breakdown)
​Act I: The Silent Connection
​The story opens in a moody, rain-soaked city, establishing a tone of ethereal urban melancholy. KAIZEN (late 20s, tall, introspective), dressed in a black trench coat, arrives at a quaint, old-world cafe. Inside, he first sees AURELIA (late 20s, shy, artistic), sketching by a window, bathed in the soft, flickering light of a sudden rumble of thunder. Their eyes meet in slow motion—a moment of instant, silent recognition—but Aurelia quickly retreats into her sketchbook, establishing her introverted nature.
​Their first exchange is prompted by a mundane accident: the kindly old cafe owner spills coffee. Aurelia offers a tissue, leading to an awkward but meaningful first conversation about the rain, which Kaizen poetically calls the ""most fitting weather.""
​The act concludes with a crucial thematic beat: the two separate without exchanging names. The Voice Over states: ""Sometimes, knowing a name... lessens the feeling that comes with the first meeting."" This establishes their relationship as one built purely on emotion, proximity, and shared silence, rather than conventional romance.
​Act II: Moments of Ephemeral Joy
​The relationship develops through a series of atmospheric, almost accidental meetings. They share the same interests, signaled when Aurelia is found holding the unique storybook Kaizen was searching for in an old library.
​Their core connection is revealed in Scene 7, where they walk together through the wet streets, their surroundings blurring as their focus remains on each other. Aurelia shares her sketchbook, filled with lonely nature drawings and, notably, a sketch of Kaizen alone in the rain—confirming she was captivated from the start.
​The Unique Scene that defines their hope is the Rooftop Scene (Scene 8). Aurelia takes Kaizen to her favorite old rooftop, overlooking the sparkling city. Kaizen folds and flies a Paper Plane, to which Aurelia whispers the film's first major piece of hope: ""If it falls down... we will meet again.""
​The first major crisis arrives when a sudden heavy rain forces them to shelter at a bus stop. Kaizen gives Aurelia his trench coat to keep her warm—a silent, symbolic act of protection. The scene ends with Aurelia rushing home, unconsciously taking the coat with her—a symbol of their intertwined lives and the unintentional nature of their bond. The audience knows their relationship has become serious, yet the underlying dread persists.
​Act III: The Inevitable Farewell
​The brief period of happiness is shown in a Montage of cafe dates and library sessions, but it is abruptly cut short when Aurelia begins to pull away, missing a date due to a family obligation and sending a text later that night that is deeply saddening and deceptively final.
​The emotional climax begins in Scene 17 when Kaizen wakes to no message from Aurelia, followed by intense anxiety. His fear is confirmed when he finds her diary at his gate, with a final, heartbreaking note: ""If you are reading this... I will always remember you... Take care of yourself.""
​Kaizen frantically searches the city's symbolic locations (rooftop, bus stop) before finally finding her in the old, empty Park (Scene 18). She is huddled on a bench next to a suitcase. When he places his coat on her shoulders again, she breaks, hugging him while confessing the truth: her father is forcing her to move to Korea for studies, and she may never be able to return.
​The Climactic Farewell (Scene 19) occurs in a light rain at the bus station. They sit under the canopy, their hands tightly held, as Aurelia rests her head on his shoulder. They acknowledge their relationship is a season that must change. Their hands slowly loosen as she boards the bus, which drives away into the night, leaving Kaizen alone.
​The film concludes days later on the Rooftop. A sad, empty Kaizen looks out over the city. A light rain begins, and then, inexplicably, he sees a PAPER PLANE spinning down toward the street, perfectly echoing Aurelia's wish. He runs down, finds the plane, but the hopeful symbolism is instantly crushed by the bleak reality of his situation. He looks up at the empty rooftop.",0,1760548085.0,animeindian,6,0.25,False

During grad school, I worked after-sales customer service for Crate & Barrel - larger stores at the time had an in-house customer service rep who worked in back of house and dealt with delivery issues, defective products, things like that. 

Through working there, I got to see that the expensive, ""luxury"" Crate & Barrel pieces were more or less the same as IKEA - lots of pieces were still particle board, a lot of furniture had to be assembled (chest of drawers, for example) - even if you paid for delivery. 

The only major difference was that they had more pieces that were manufactured in the United States and delivery included assembly on larger pieces like sofas, dining tables, and beds. 

IKEA actually was better in a lot of ways - a lot of pieces have warranties (nothing at Crate at the time had a warranty - unsure if that's still the case), the return policy is better, and a lot of IKEA soft furnishings feel more durable/have washable covers. 

IKEA pieces are easier to put together, and disassemble. You can't really disassemble a Crate sofa, for example, if you want to move it. I'd get endless calls from customers stating that they were moving and wanted disassembly instructions, and I'd have to tell them to hire a furniture take apart service. 

The same goes for what I've heard about Pottery Barn/West Elm. 

I just had a ton of IKEA pieces delivered the other day - a Tonstad bedroom set, a Tonstad COD, a Lisabo dining set, a Tonstad coffee table and the brand new Grunnarp sleeper sofa. All are exceptionally beautiful, look great, were easy to put together, and are really high quality. 

In total, I only paid around $3150 pre-tax. A similar set of items from Crate/Pottery Barn/West Elm would be around $11,500 and would be more or less the same quality. 

I mentioned to a friend that I had IKEA furniture delivered, and they just scuffed and said how cheap their stuff was.

Where do all of the drugs come from? PART 1 of 2

Two weeks after Gary Webb's Dark Alliance series appeared in the San Jose Mercury News in August 1996, contributing editor Charles Bowden found himself in a bar, having a few drinks with some narcs (his idea of a good night). ""For some reason, Webb's piece came up, and I asked the guys, 'So, what do you think? Is what Webb wrote about the CIA true?'"" recalls Bowden, the author of fifteen books, including Blood Orchid and Juarez: The Laboratory of Our Future. ""And they all turned to me and said, ""Of course it is.' That's when I knew that somebody would have to do this story, and I figured it might as well be me."" ""The Pariah,"" Bowden's story on Webb -- a man he describes as ""real smart, real straight, lives on a cul-de-sac, family man, all that crap"" --Davis Granger (editor)

Editor's letter

...The world Charles Bowden leads us into in his story, ""The Pariah"" (page 150), is, on the other hand, a place few would willingly visit. Reporter Gary Webb chose to enter the alternate universe where the CIA sponsors armies and sometimes finds itself allied with drug dealers who sell their wares in the United States. Webb wrote a newspaper series that documented how the Nicaraguan contras of the 1980s were in part financed by just such an arrangement -- and he was then professionally destroyed for it. Bowden, in the course of reporting this story over the last six months, found considerable evidence that parallels and supports Webb's articles -- including revelations from one of the DEA's most decorated agents, who speaks for the first time about the CIA's complicity in the drug trade. It was not, however, the agency's ties to drug traffickers that Bowden found most disturbing. It was that a man can lose his livelihood, his calling, his reputation, for telling the truth....

**THE PARIAH**  Esquire magazine, September 1998

Two years ago, Gary Webb wrote a series of articles that said some bad things about the CIA and drug traffickers. The CIA denied the charges, and every major newspaper in the country took the agency's word for it. Gary Webb was ruined. Which is a shame, because he was right.

By Brad Wilson Charles Bowden | Sep 01 '98

HE TELLS ME I'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT WHEN THE BIG DOG GETS OFF THE PORCH, and I'm getting confused here. He is talking to me from a fishing camp up near the Canadian border, and as he tries to tell me about the Big Dog, I can only imagine a wall of green and deep blue lakes with northern pike. But he is very patient with me. **Mike Holm** did his hard stints in the Middle East, the Miami station, and Los Angeles, all for the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, and he is determined that I face the reality he knows. So he starts again. He repeats, ""When the Big Dog gets off the porch, watch out."" And by the Big Dog, he means the full might of the United States government. At that moment, he continues, you play by

Big Boy rules, and that means, he explains, that there are no rules but to complete the mission. We've gotten into all this schooling because I asked him about reports that he received when he was stationed in Miami that Southern Air Transport, a CIA-contracted airline, was landing planeloads of cocaine at Homestead Air Force Base nearby. Back in the eighties, Holm's informants kept telling him about these flights, and then he was told by his superiors to ""stand down because of national security."" And so he did. He is an honorable man who believes in his government, and he didn't ask why the flights were taking place; he simply obeyed. Because he has seen the Big Dog get off the porch, and he has tasted Big Boy rules. Besides, he tells me, these things are done right, and if you look into the matter, you'll find contract employees or guys associated with the CIA, but you won't find a CIA case officer on a loading dock tossing kilos of coke around. Any more than Mike Holm ever saw a plane loaded top to bottom with kilos of coke. He didn't have to. He believed his informants. And he believed in the skill and power of the CIA. And he believed in the sheer might and will of the Big Dog when he finally decides to get off the porch.

As his words hang in the air, I remember a convict who says he once worked with the United States government and who also tasted Big Boy rules. This man has not gone fishing. This convict insisted that I hold the map up to the thick prison glass as he jabbed his finger into the mountains. There, he said, that's the place, and his eyes gleamed as his words accelerated. There, in the mountains, they have a colony of two thousand Colombians out of Medellin, guarded by the Mexican army. I craned my neck to see where his finger was rubbing against the map, and made an x with my pen. That's when the guard burst into the convict's small cubicle and ordered him to sit down.

The convict is a man of little credibility in the greater world. He is a Mexican national, highly intelligent and exact in his speech. He is a man electric with the memory of his days working as a DEA informant in Mexico, huddling in his little apartment with his clandestine radio. He said I must check his DEA file; he gave the names of his case officers; he noted that he delivered to them the exact locations of thirteen airfields operated jointly by the drug cartels and the CIA. The man's eyes bugged out as his excitement shredded the tedium of doing time and he returned to his former life of secret transmissions, cutouts, drinks with pilots ferrying dope, bullshitting his way through army checkpoints.

He said, ""I'll be out in six months or one year, depending on the hearing. We can go. I'll take you up there."" I have always steered clear of the secret world, because it is very hard to penetrate, and because if you discover anything about it, you are not believed. And because I remember what happened to one reporter who wrote about that world, about the Big Dog getting off the porch, about the Big Boy rules. So I thought about the convict's information and did nothing with it.

But this reporter who went ahead and wrote while I stopped, I kept thinking about him. When I mention him, and what happened to him, to Mike Holm, he says, ""Ah, he must have drawn blood."" Holm is very impressed with the CIA, and he wants me to slow down, think, and understand something: ""The CIA's mission is to break laws and be ruthless. And they are dangerous.""

I had been thinking about looking into the claim that during the civil war in Nicaragua in the eighties, the CIA helped move dope to the United States to buy guns for the contras, who were mounting an insurrection against the leftist Sandinistas. So I called up **Hector Berrellez**, a guy who worked under Mike Holm in Los Angeles, a guy known within the DEA as its Eliot Ness, and he said, ""Look, the CIA is the best in the world. You're not going to beat them; you're never going to get a smoking gun. The best you're going to get is a little story from me.""

What Berrellez meant by a smoking gun is this: proof that the United States government has, through the Central Intelligence Agency and its ties to criminals, facilitated the international traffic in narcotics. That's the trail the reporter was on when his career in newspapers went to rack and ruin. So I decided to look him up.

His name is Gary Webb.

GARY WEBB LOVES THE STACKS OF THE STATE LIBRARY ACROSS from the capitol in Sacramento, the old classical building framed with aromatic camphor trees. He enters the lobby and becomes part of a circling mural called War Through the Ages, an after-flash of World War I painted by Frank Van Sloun in 1929. The panels start with the ax and club, then wade through gore to doughboys marching off to the War to End All Wars. THIS HOUSE OF PEACE, the inscription on the west wall admonishes, SHALL STAND WHILE MEN FEAR NOT TO DIE IN ITS DEFENSE.

He was here in the summer of 1995 because of a call from a woman named Coral Marie Talavera Baca. She told him her drug-dealer boyfriend was in jail and one of the witnesses against him was ""a guy who used to work with the CIA selling drugs. Tons of it."" Webb was brought up short: In eighteen years of reporting, every person who'd ever called him about the CIA had turned out to be a flake. Webb started to back away on the phone, and the woman sensed it and exploded: ""How dare you treat me like an idiot!"" She said she had lots of documents and invited him to a court date that month. And so he went.

Coral's boyfriend turned out to be a big-time trafficker. She brought Webb a pile of DEA and FBI reports about, and federal grand-jury testimony by, a guy named Oscar Danilo Blandon. Webb was intrigued by government files that told of Nicaraguans selling dope in California and giving dope money to the contras. During a break in the hearing, he headed for the restroom and ran into the U.S. attorney, David Hall. Webb told him he was a reporter for the San Jose Mercury News, and Hall asked why he was at a piddling hearing. ""Actually, I've been reading,"" Webb answered, ""and I was curious to know what you made of Blandon's testimony about selling drugs for the  
contras in L.A. Did you believe him?"" ""Well, yeah,"" Hall answered, ""but I don't know how you could absolutely confirm it. I mean, I don't know what to tell you. The CIA won't tell me anything.""

Webb followed a trail of crumbs: some San Francisco newspaper clips, some court records in San Diego, where this strange figure, Blandon, had been indicted for selling coke in 1992 and, according to the documents, had been at it for years and sold tons. He and his wife had been held without bail because the federal prosecutor, L.J. O'Neale, said his minimum mandatory punishment would be life plus a $4 million fine. Blandon's defense attorney had argued that his client was being smeared because he'd been active in helping the contras in the early eighties.  
The file told Webb that Blandon wound up doing about two years, and that he was now out. The file recorded that at O'Neale's request, the government had twice quietly cut Blandon's sentence and that he was now working as a paid undercover informant for the DEA.

After about six weeks of this kind of foraging, Webb went to the state library. For six days in September, he sat at a microfiche with rolls of dimes and read an eleven-hundred-page report from 1989 compiled by a subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a subcommittee chaired by Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts that dealt with the contras and cocaine.  
[http://www.thememoryhole.org/kerry/index.htm](http://www.thememoryhole.org/kerry/index.htm)  
Buried in the federal document was evidence of direct links between drug dealers and the contras; evidence, dated four years before the American invasion of Panama, that Manuel Noriega was in the dope business; drug dealers saying under oath that they gave money to the contras (and passing polygraphs); pilots talking of flying guns down and dope back and landing with their cargoes at Homestead Air Force Base in Florida.

Suddenly, Coral's phone call didn't seem so crazy. Webb called up Jack Blum, the Washington, D.C., lawyer who led the Kerry inquiry and said, ""Maybe I'm crazy, but this seems like a huge story to me."" ""Well, it's nice to hear someone finally say that, even if it is ten years later,"" Blum allowed, and then he proceeded to tell Webb almost exactly what he told me recently when I made a similar innocent phone call to him. ""What happened was, our credibility was questioned, and we were personally trashed. The \[Reagan\] administration and some people in Congress tried to make us look like crazies, and to some degree it worked. I remember having conversations with reporters in which they would say, 'Well, the administration says this is all wrong.' And I'd say, 'Look, why don't you cover the fucking hearing instead of coming to me with what the administration says?' And they'd say, 'Well, the witness is a drug dealer. Why should I do that?' And I used to say this regularly: 'Look, the minute I find a Lutheran minister or a priest who was on the scene when they delivered six hundred kilos of cocaine at some air base in contra land, I'll put him on the stand, but until then, you take what you can get.' The big papers stayed as far away from this issue as they could. It was like they didn't want to know.""

Webb was entering contra land, and when you enter that country, you run into the CIA, since the contras were functionally a CIA army. (The agency hired them, picked their leaders, plotted their strategy, and sometimes, because of contra incompetence, executed raids for them.) This is hardly odd, since the agency was created in 1947 for precisely such toils and has over the decades sponsored armies around the world, whether to land at the Bay of Pigs or kick the Soviets out of Afghanistan. After a year of research, in August 1996, Webb published a three-day, fifteen-thousand-word series in the Mercury News called ""Dark Alliance."" It is a story almost impossible to recapitulate in detail but simple in outline: Drug dealers working with the contras brought tons of cocaine into California in the 1980s and sold a lot of it to one dealer, a legend called Freeway Ricky Ross, who had connections with the L.A. street gangs and through this happenstance helped launch the national love of crack. That's it, a thesis that mixes the realpolitik of the-ends-justify-the-means with dollops of shit-happens.

The series set off a firestorm in black communities, where many suspected they had been deliberately targeted with the dope as an act of genocide (there is no evidence of that), and provoked repudiations of the story by The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times. The knockdowns of Webb's story questioned the importance of Nicaraguan dealers like Blandon, the significance of Ricky Ross, how much money, if any, reached the contras, and how crucial any of this was to the crack explosion in the eighties, and brushed aside  
any evidence of CIA involvement. But while raising questions about Webb's work, none of these papers or any other paper in the country undertook a serious investigation of Webb's evidence. A Los Angeles Times staff member who was present at a meeting called to plan the Times's response has told me that one motive for the paper's harsh appraisal was simply pride: The Times wasn't going to let an out-of-town paper win a Pulitzer in its backyard.

Later, when it was all over, Webb spelled out exactly what he meant and exactly what he thought of the CIA's skills: The series ""focused on the relationship between the contras and the crack king. It mentioned the CIA's role in passing, noting that some of the money had gone to a CIA-run army and that there were federal law-enforcement reports suggesting that the CIA knew about it. I never believed, and never wrote, that there was a grand CIA conspiracy behind the crack plague. Indeed, the more I learned about the agency, the more certain of that I became. The CIA couldn't even mine a harbor without getting its trench coat stuck in its fly.""

After a while, the San Jose Mercury News series disappeared except on a few byways of the Internet, Gary Webb was ruined, and things went back to normal. Things like Oliver North's diary entry linking dope and guns for the contras, like Carlos Lehder, a big Colombian drug dealer, testifying as a prosecution witness in federal court during the Noriega trial about the Medellin cartel's $10 million donation to the contras, like the entire history of unseemly connections between the international drug world and the CIA -- all this went away, as it has time and time again in the past. A kind of orthodoxy settled over the American press that assumed that Webb's work had been thoroughly refuted. He became the Discredited Gary Webb.

And so in June 1997, Webb wound up going to a motel room he hated. The Mercury News's editors were supposed to fix him up with an apartment, but they never figured he'd show up for his dead-end transfer from investigative reporter to pretty much a nothing. So they made no arrangements, just shunted him to the paper's Cupertino bureau on the south end of Silicon Valley, his family 150 miles away in Sacramento. After a few days of the motel, he found himself in a tiny apartment. He was in his early forties, and his life and his life's work were over. He endlessly watched a tape of Caddyshack and tried to forget about missing his wife, Sue, his three kids, his dog, his work. He was an ordinary guy, by his lights, with the suburban home, an aquarium in the study, two games a week in an amateur hockey league. Now, during the day, he visited the bureau, and the guys there treated him okay, because they were all in the same boat, people who had pissed off their newspaper and been shipped to its internal Siberia, where they were paid to retool the press releases of the computer and software companies. Webb was fighting the paper through arbitration with the Newspaper Guild, and so while his case dragged on, he refused to let his byline run. But he did his assignments. After all, they were paying him a solid mid-five-figure wage; he was their star investigative reporter, the guy they had brought in from The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 1987 to do, in their words, ""kick-ass journalism."" Within two years, he'd helped them bring home a Pulitzer with a team of Mercury News reporters who jumped on the San Francisco earthquake. Then he blew the lid off civil forfeiture in  
California -- law enforcement's practice of seizing property from alleged crooks and then forgetting to ever convict, try, or even charge them. That series got the law changed. He was hot. He was good. He kicked ass.

Now Caddyshack flickered against his eyes hour after hour. His thirteen-year-old son asked, ""Why don't you get another job?"" And Gary Webb told him, ""That's what they think I'll do. But they're wrong. I'm gonna fight.""  
But fight how? He was one fucking disgrace. Oliver North described his work as ""absolute garbage."" Webb was stretched thin. The week the series ran, he and his wife closed on a new house and moved in. Payments. So each morning, he went to the Cupertino bureau, and there were assignments from the city desk. Seems a police horse died, and he was supposed to nail down this equine death. So he did. He investigated the hell out of it and wrote it up, and, by God, the thing was good. Went on page one, of course, without his name on it. The horse died from a medical problem, constipation. The horse was full of shit.

HECTOR BERRELLEZ STUMBLED ONTO GARY WEBB'S STORY YEARS before Gary Webb knew a thing about it. His journey into that world happened this way: Hector was not fond of cops. He remembered them slapping him around when he was a kid. He was a barrio boy from South Tucson, a square mile of poverty embedded in the booming Sun Belt city. His father was a Mexican immigrant. After being drafted into the Army in the late sixties, Berrellez couldn't find a job in the copper mines, so he hooked up as a temporary with the small South Tucson police force to finance his way through college. And it was then that Hector Berrellez accidentally discovered his jones: He loved working the streets with a badge. The state police force hired him, and Hector, still green, managed to do a one-kilo heroin deal in the early seventies, a major score for the time. The DEA snapped him up, and suddenly the kid who had wanted to flee the barrio and become a lawyer was a federal narc. He loved the life. In the DEA, there are the administrators, who usually have little street experience, the suits. And then there are the street guys like Hector, and they call themselves something else. Gunslingers. His hobbies were jogging, weight lifting, guitar playing. And firearms. A Glock? Never. ""Only girls carry Glocks,"" he snaps. ""They're a sissy gun. Plastic. You can't hit anyone over the head with a Glock.""

In September 1986, Sergeant Tom Gordon of the Los Angeles sheriff's narcotics strike force pieced together intelligence about a big-time drug ring in town run by Danilo Blandon. A month later, on October 23, Gordon went before a judge with a twenty-page detailed statement documenting that ""monies gained from the sales of cocaine are transported to Florida and laundered....The monies are filtered to the contra rebels to buy arms in the war in Nicaragua."" He got a search warrant for the organization's stash houses. On Friday, October 24, there was a briefing of more than a hundred law-enforcement guys from the sheriff's office, the DEA, the FBI. That was the same day that President Ronald Reagan, after months of hassle, signed a $100 million aid bill that reactivated a licit cash flow to the beleaguered contras. And on Monday, October 27, at daybreak, the strike force simultaneously hit fourteen L.A.-area stash houses connected with Blandon.

That's where just another day in the life of Hector Berrellez got weird. Generally, at that early hour, good dopers are out cold; the work tends toward long nights and sleeping. As Berrellez remembers, ""We were expecting to come up with a lot of coke."" Instead, they got coffee and sometimes doughnuts. The house he hit had the lights on, and everyone, two men and a woman, was up. The guy who answered the door said, ""Good morning; we've been expecting you. Come on in."" The house was tidy, the beds were already made, and the damn coffee was on. The  
three residents were polite, even congenial. ""It was obvious,"" says Berrellez, ""that they were told."" The place was clean; all fourteen houses were clean. The only thing Berrellez and the other guys found in the house was a professional scale.

But there was a safe, and Berrellez got one of the residents to open it reluctantly. Inside, he found records of kilos matched with amounts of money, an obvious dope ledger, a photograph of a guy in flight dress in front of what looked to be a military jet, and photographs of some guys in combat. Hector asked the guy who the hell the people in the photographs were, and the guy said, ""Oh, they are freedom fighters."" What the hell is this? Berrellez wondered. He left and went to a couple of the other houses that had been hit, and Jesus, they were clean, the coffee was on, sometimes there were doughnuts for the cops, and the same kind of documents showed up. But no dope, not a damn thing.

For a holy warrior, October 27, 1986, was a bad day. At the debriefing after the raid, Berrellez remembers one of the cops saying that the houses had been tipped to the raid by ""elements of the CIA."" And he thought, What? ""I was shocked,"" he says now. ""I was in a state of belief."" He was supposed to believe that his own government was helping dopers? No way. ""I didn't want to believe,"" he says And so he didn't. He was that rock-solid first-generation citizen, and he believed in America. He remembers having this ongoing argument with his dad about whether there was corruption in the U.S. like the old man had tasted in Mexico. His father would ask, Do you really think things are so clean here? And Hector would have none of it; damn right they're clean here. And he was clean, and he was in a good outfit (a position he is still passionate about -- his absolute love for the troops he served with in the DEA), and he was in a holy war against a tide of poison.

In 1987, he was transferred to Mazatlan in Sinaloa, Mexico, to run the DEA station. Sinaloa was the drug center for Mexico; in the history of the Mexican drug cartels, all but one leader has been Sinaloan born and bred. He took the wife, got a beach house in the coastal city, and ran with the job. Two months into the assignment, narcotrafficantes chased his wife and two-year-old daughter from the beach back to the house, and they had to be evacuated to the States.

In October 1988, Hector and some Mexican federal police hit a small hamlet that housed a ton of coke and twenty tons of marijuana. The firefight lasted three hours, with thousands of rounds exchanged. When three federales were mowed down on the field of fire, Hector managed to pull them to safety with another agent. He commandeered a cab to take the wounded to a hospital, then returned to the shoot-out. For this combat, Hector and two other agents at the scene were brought to the White House and given a medal by Attorney General Edwin Meese. He was on a roll that would eventually earn him twelve consecutive superior-performance awards.

Hector Berrellez, twenty-four years in the DEA, known as the agency's Eliot Ness. As he read about Gary Webb, he thought, This shit is true.

In Mexico, Hector was running two hundred to three hundred informants, and he was bringing in a torrent of information on the drug world and its links to the Mexican government. But something else happened down there in Sinaloa that stuck in his mind. His army of informants was constantly reporting strange fortified bases scattered around Mexico, but they were not Mexican military bases, and, his informants told him, the planes were shipping drugs. Camps in Durango, Sinaloa, Baja, Veracruz, all over Mexico. Hector wrote up these camps and the information he was getting on big drug shipments. And each month, he would go to Mexico City to meet with his DEA superiors and American-embassy staff, and he started mentioning these reports. He was told, Stay away from those bases; they're our training camps, special operations. He thought, What the hell is this? I'm here to enforce the drug laws, and I'm being told to do nothing.

THE EMPTY ROOM SAGS WITH FATIGUE AS THE SPORTS TELEVISIONS quietly float in the corner. California's ban on smoking has emptied the watering holes. The hotel squats by a four-lane highway amid bland suburbs that blanket Sacramento's eastern flank against the Sierra Nevada. Everything is normal here; this is the visual bedrock of Ronald Reagan's America.

Gary Webb orders Maker's Mark on the rocks. He is a man of average height, with brown hair, a trim mustache, an easy smile, and laconic, laid-back speech, the basic language of Middle America. He moves easily, a kind of amble through life. His father was a marine, and his childhood meant moving a lot before finally coming to ground in Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio. He's married to his high school sweetheart; they have three kids and live on a tree-lined cul-de-sac with a pool in back, a television in the family room, his Toyota with 150,000 miles in the drive, Sue's minivan, and on the cement the chalk outline of a hopscotch game. He looks white-collar, maybe sells insurance.

All he has ever wanted to be is a reporter. He started out as a kid, writing up sports results for a weekly at a nickel an inch. The Gary Webb who suddenly loomed up nationally with this bad talk about the CIA and drugs was a long time coming, and he came from the dull center of the country, and he came from an essay entitled, ""What America Means to Me,"" for which he was runner-up in the fifth-grade essay contest, and he came from the smell of ink, the crackle of a little weekly where he nailed cold the week's tumult in the Little League.

Webb is not a drinker, probably because his marine father was, but now in the empty hotel bar, he is drinking. He is not used to talking about himself, because he is a reporter, and a reporter is not the story, but now he is talking about himself. When Gary Webb talks, he sometimes leans back, but often as not, he leans forward, and when he is really into what he is saying, he grabs his left wrist with his right hand as if he were taking his own pulse, and then his voice gets even flatter, and the words are very evenly spaced, and he never goes too fast, hardly any hint of  
rat-a-tat-tat -- he is always measured and unexcited. But when he grabs that wrist, you can tell now that the words really matter. Because he believes. In facts. In publishing facts. In the fact that publishing facts makes a difference in how people look at things. Believes, without reason or question, believes absolutely. As for coincidence, it doesn't fit in with his mission. He also has no tolerance for conspiracy theories. By God, if he finds a conspiracy, it is not a theory, it is a fucking conspiracy, because it is grounded in facts.

When he was twenty-three, he was kind of drifting, living in the basement of Sue's house with her parents. He was writing rock 'n' roll stuff for a weekly, still grinding away at college and about three units shy of a degree. His father walked out on the marriage, leaving his mother, a housewife, and his younger brother without a check. So Webb quit college to support them. A teacher in his journalism department told him that the strange guy who ran the Post in Lexington, Kentucky, set aside one day a week for walk-ins. Webb walked in and said, ""I need a job.""  
The editor said, ""Go do two pieces and bring them back in a week.""

One was on the barmaids and strippers of Newport, Kentucky, the sin town across the river from Cincinnati. The editor tossed it aside and said, ""Thrice-told tale."" The other was on a guy who carved gravestones; that one the editor kind of liked. He said, ""Bring me two more."" Webb was shaken, went home and sat in the backyard, and then he thought, Fuck, I can do this. This goes on for weeks. A kid calls the paper about the dog he's found run over in the street. He's taken it to the Humane Society; they want to put it to sleep, and the kid is very upset. Webb is sent out to see if he can do anything fit for a newspaper. He talks to the vet, who says it is hopeless, that the dog will never walk again, whether he operates or not. When Webb reports back to the editor, he says, ""Get that guy on the phone,"" and after a few blunt words from the editor, by God, the vet is going to operate. And it works. The damn dog is leaping in the air. Finally, the dog goes home to the kid who found him, a kid in a wheelchair who seemed to identify with an injured mutt and was horrified at the idea that a cripple should be done away with. Story and photograph on the front page. Webb is hired. Years later, the old editor would tell him, ""If that dog hadn't walked, you'd have never been hired.""

There is a guy in the newsroom who is kind of burned out, a city editor. He watches the new hire for a few weeks. He tells him he will teach him the ropes, how to ferret out facts, how to find out damn near anything, how to be an investigative reporter. On one condition. He says Webb has to swear never to become a fucking editor. Webb agrees. His first series was seventeen parts on organized crime in the coal industry. Then he moved up to a good job on The Cleveland Plain Dealer and was in heaven: Ohio was the mother lode of corruption in government. He got an offer from the Mercury News in 1987. After a brief bidding war, he moved the family west, great place to raise kids, and besides, during his father's wanderings as a marine, Webb happened to be born in California. Everything was fine. He was in the Sacramento bureau and so hardly ever in the newsroom, much less around editors. In a big story for the paper, he took on one of the area's major employers. After the first day of the story, the company bought a full-page ad refuting it. After the next installment, the company bought a two-page ad. Webb looked around and noticed that nothing happened to him. The paper backed him up.

GARY WEBB'S ""DARK ALLIANCE"" BROKE AN OLD STORY. THE HISTORY of the CIA's relationship with international drug dealers has been documented and published, yet it is almost completely unknown to most citizens and reporters. Webb himself had only a dim notion of this record. And so he reacted with horror when the implications of his research first began to become clear to him: that while much of the federal government fought narcotics as a plague, the CIA, in pursuing its foreign-policy goals, sometimes facilitated the work of drug traffickers. ""Dark Alliance"" is surrounded by a public record that bristles with similar instances of CIA connections with drug people:

\-- Alan Fiers, who headed the CIA Central American Task Force, testified during the Iran-contra hearings in August 1987, ""With respect to \[drug trafficking by\] the resistance forces...it is not a couple of people. It is a lot of people.""

\-- In 1983, fifty people, many of them Nicaraguans, were caught unloading a big coke shipment in San Francisco. A couple of them claimed involvement with the CIA, and after a meeting between CIA officials and the U.S. attorney handling the case, $36,000 found in a bedside table was returned because it ""belonged to the contras."" This spring, when the CIA published its censored report on involvement of the agency with drug traffickers in the contra war (a report that exists solely because a firestorm erupted in Congress after Webb's series), this incident was explained thusly: ""Based upon the information available to them at the time, CIA personnel reached the erroneous conclusion that one of the two individuals...was a former CIA asset."" Logically, an admission that CIA ""assets"" can sometimes be drug dealers.

\-- In 1986, Wanda Palacio parted company with the Medellin cartel and started talking to Senator John Kerry's subcommittee, which was looking into the byways of the contra war and dope. Palacio said she'd witnessed two flights of coke out of Barranquilla, Colombia, on planes belonging to the CIA-contracted Southern Air Transport. She also had the dates and had seen the pilot. She also said Jorge Ochoa, another drug boss, said the flights were part of a ""drugs for guns"" deal. On September 26, 1986, Kerry took her eleven-page statement to William Weld, who was then the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division of the Justice Department. Weld allowed that he was not surprised to find claims of ""bum agents, former and current CIA agents"" dabbling in dope deals with the Colombian cartels. On October 3, Weld's office rejected Palacio's statement and offer to be a witness because of what it saw as contradictions in her testimony. On October 5, 1986, the Sandinistas shot a CIA plane out of the sky and captured one of Oliver North's patriots, one Eugene Hasenfus. Palacio was sitting in Kerry's office when a photograph of Hasenfus's dead pilot flashed across the television screen. She whooped that the pilot was the same guy she'd seen in Colombia loading coke on the Southern Air Transport flight in early October 1985. An Associated Press reporter, Robert Parry, investigated the crash and obtained the pilot's logs, which showed that on October 2, 4, and 6, 1985, the pilot had taken a Southern Air Transport plane to Barranquilla, Colombia. Palacio took a polygraph on the matter and passed.

\-- Through much of the contra war, SETCO Air, an airline run by Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros out of Honduras, was the principal airline used to transport supplies and personnel for the contras. Hector Berrellez later sent Ballesteros to Marion Federal Prison in Illinois to serve a couple of life sentences for dope peddling.

ABOUT THE SAME TIME GARY WEBB WAS MAKING HIS BONES AT The Cleveland Plain Dealer and winning part of a Pulitzer at the Mercury News, Hector Berrellez was becoming a legend. After two years of living at ground zero in Sinaloa, he was brought home to Los Angeles in 1989 to take over the most significant investigation in DEA history, that of the murder of DEA agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena. Camarena had been bagged in broad daylight from in front of the American consulate in Guadalajara in February 1986. His tortured body was found a month later. The investigation had stalled, so the DEA tossed it in Hector's lap. He ran with the new power, the raft of agents under his command, the huge budget for buying informants in Mexico. The case was a core matter for the DEA: The murder of Camarena was the event that gave the ragtag agency its martyr. The investigation was called Operation Leyenda, ""Operation Legend.""

During Operation Leyenda, a major drug guy in Sinaloa called Cochi Loco, ""the Crazy Pig,"" put a contract on Hector's head. In the drug world, there are so many possible reasons for murder that a simple one is seldom clear. Whatever the immediate cause, in the early nineties a hit team was sent north to kill Hector.

One day in 1991, in the underground garage of the building in Los Angeles where the DEA and a bunch of federal agencies rent office space, someone walked up to a guy sitting in a car and clipped him in the head with a .22. The man died instantly and fell forward into the steering wheel, and the sound of a car horn wailed through the garage. Hector remembers that they found him with the motor running, and neatly placed on the floorboard of the car was the gun, in a Mexican-tooled holster, and the two latex surgical gloves that had been worn by the hit man. Someone wanted a clear message delivered.

The dead man was a guy from the General Services Administration who happened to work in the same building as the DEA. He had been in some kind of a hurry and had pulled into a DEA parking space. The guy was a ringer for Hector's partner. Three days after the hit, Hector picked up the phone in his office and heard the voice of Chichon Rico Urrea, a significant drug figure who was doing a stint in a prison in Guadalajara. Chichon told Hector, ""You see what happened to your guy in the garage? That's going to happen to more of your guys.""

Hector told the guy to go fuck himself, said he could kill all the fucking GSA guys he wanted. But Hector was questioning his faith. The faith was the war on drugs. The faith was that he was a righteous soldier in this war. The faith was that he was risking his life for the forces of light against the forces of darkness. And he was Eliot Ness, goddammit; he was the most decorated guy anyone could remember in the DEA, the man running its key investigation, the guy who had killed people, the guy bloodied in the world of Mexican corruption. All of that Hector could handle -- none of that could ever touch the faith. But other things could. Things he saw and learned in Mexico. And things he saw in the United States. He began to doubt that there was a real commitment to win this war on drugs. He saw his government winking at too many narcotics connections. He took Kiki Camarena's murder personally, because as agents they were mirror images -- gung-ho, committed drugbusters. And impediments to his investigation pissed Hector off. So in 1992, four years before Gary Webb sprang ""Dark Alliance"" on the world, Hector Berrellez sat down in his federal office in Los Angeles and picked up the phone and recommended action to the DEA. Things had come to his attention, and he thought, Somebody's gotta investigate this crap. In fact, he hoped to be that investigator.

Everyone I loved had turned away.

I had burned every bridge trying to prove I wasn’t broken — and in the process, I became everything they said I was.

The messages stopped. The calls stopped. Even the people who used to check in out of obligation went quiet. It was like I had disappeared, and no one noticed.

For a while, I tried to play it off like I didn’t care.

I told myself I was better off alone. That I didn’t need anyone. That this was my “clean slate.” But deep down, I was angry, terrified, and completely numb all at once.

I’d walk through my house and see little reminders of the person I used to be — a pair of shoes by the door, the chipped coffee mug I always used, a photo turned face-down on the counter. I’d stare at it all and think, how did I get here?

I wasn’t ready to heal.

Frida interview was September 5th, 1982, about the new album, sorrow, pride and gossip. Agnetha interview was October 24th , 1982 and she talks about her ten years with ABBA and personal attacks.","Aftonbladet, September 5th, 1982 - Page 18

 

Frida on Sorrow, Gossip, Pride and the new Record

 

No pain can be stronger than the breakup of a person you have been so close to for so many years.

 

Frida's solo LP has just been released worldwide.

\--

While ABBA is on a low during Benny's paternity leave, it's Frida, 36, who is focusing on a big career of her own.

Here she talks candidly about what she wants right now. About Sorrow, Pride, Gossip and of course - the new album.

“I'm too shy to go out to a restaurant alone”

On the way to Polar's office at Norrmalmstorg in Stockholm, you must push your way between appeal meetings and nervous politicians who try to sound experienced and unfazed but look like animals that have been released from a protected zoo. When I talk to Frida later, I say something about politics, and she says:

\- Ugh, yes, I don't trust politicians anymore. I listened to Palme and Fälldin on TV and burst out laughing. It was almost just a verbal battle.

But Fälldin did a good job. He is charming and dares to stand and sweat and be a little unsure and say the wrong thing and get angry. He is incredibly human, while I think Palme is terribly cold.

Polar's office has been newly decorated in a discreet white color. The corridors are full of people with computer lists. In the toilet, Affärsvärlden and Veckans Affärer are in the way that Kalle Anka or Hänt i veckan are in others.

Frida is sitting in the coffee room. She is dressed in black. Discreet black. Not trendy and challenging black. She shows where the coffee and coffee cups are and I say:

On your new LP, I think you can hear greater sadness and greater pride in your voice than before. Could that be so?

Yes, that's probably true. It has to do with my maturity. Nothing that hasn't hit my heart right away has been included. I feel proud and have a great sadness deep down to take away.

She talks about her divorce from Benny:

When you go through such pain as a breakup with someone you've been very close to for so many years, you hit rock bottom. It hits you terribly hard and you lose your footing for a period of time.

There can't be a pain that's stronger. Nothing feels more digusting than that. That's why it can only get better, only more positive. A year and a half have passed, and I think it's been progressing all the time for me.

She speaks with a fragile and reserved voice. Far from the one you find on records and hear on radio and TV. She starts each sentence by sinking into herself, and when she answers, it's as if she's thought out exactly what she's going to say.

We talk about her upbringing in Torshälla with her grandmother and end up saying that she now buys clothes for 10,000 kronor a month to compensate for her poor childhood.

10,000 a month - that's not wise, she says.

My grandmother worked as a cleaner, seamstress and dishwasher - you know, everything that was possible to get. We had money for food - that was pretty much everything.

How has it affected you?

I learned early on to take care of myself. That was probably the positive thing. But it also gave me an inherent uncertainty that has haunted me through the years. Until a couple of years ago. A certain kind of insecurity, maybe.

How did you get over it?

With the breakup with Benny, I found myself in a completely new situation. I had to stand on my own two feet, take care of myself, my life and my children. And when you feel like you're fixing things, you become stronger. I didn't have to go to professional therapy, but I had good friends, and I probably went to therapy with them instead.

I've had friends who were fantastic for me. You need that in crisis situations.

She says she finds it really boring to live alone - when you don't choose your loneliness yourself.

But my children have lived with me for the last six years. Although right now my 16-year-old daughter Lotta is in the USA to go to high school for a year. She lives with a Jewish family in Rochester, New York State. I would have liked to do that too when I was her age.

There's a debate going on right now about gossip and lies in women's magazines. Agnetha Fältskog and Anders Wall have finally sued them. How do you feel about gossip about private life?

 

Agnetha and I have a very deep connection

 

I have also been affected, although more superficially. But for Agnetha it has been worse. Her entire integrity has been threatened. What they did was really upsetting. It was completely right of her to come out like this, I think.

A month or so ago it was written that you had an affair with a married man.

\- Do you want me to comment on that?

No, but I wonder how you manage your private life. How you manage your integrity.

My private life is mine and it concerns no one else. It must be that way - otherwise I would probably feel very bad. This life I lived before with outsiders is a closed chapter.

I'm too shy to go out to a restaurant alone. I feel watched and become stiff. It feels like I must behave in a certain way. I want to go out with friends so that I have someone to lean on.

I'm not a bit of a sinner

When it came to ABBA, Agnetha was described as innocence and you as sin personified. Is that so?

Frida laughs and says:

What a shame... I'm not a bit of a sinner.  I'm a clean, honest and straightforward chick.

There's no sin in me.

You never show your apartment in the newspapers?

Well, that would never occur to me.

That's a shame. I would have loved to do an interview with you under the heading ""An hour in Frida's quarter"".

Hehe... well, it exploded right away.

 

Howdy, have you stopped bodybuilding now?

\-Yes. That was during an intense period when I was dancing, jogging and bodybuilding. But then I got so tired of it and stopped everything. I've only bounced on my trampoline at home once in the last year.

But I feel great anyway. I had a health check-up today and had very low and fine blood pressure.

You are moderate and admire Gösta Bohman very much. Do you admire Adelsohn just as much?

Now it turns out that Adelsohn and I hang out a bit privately, she says but quickly hastens to add:

Yes, not him and I but in company, that's all. I think he's nice. But what he's like as a politician, we don't know yet. Time will tell.

She sounds engaged when she talks about politics and suddenly the dialect from Torshälla and Eskilstuna comes through.

You met your father in 1977 after many years. Your father was a German soldier in Norway during World War II when he met your mother. Do you still meet your father?

Well, it was a very long time ago now. It felt hard to embark on a completely new family life. It felt like a strain more than something stimulating. It was like meeting any stranger - even though he was my biological father.

Why are you and the rest of ABBA so adamantly against employee funds?

\- A collective. what is it called now; collectivization of Sweden would be terrible. It will be a concentration of power that will not be good for a single person.

But it is said that no companies should be forced into the funds and that they will basically only lead to companies getting money more easily.

I don't think so at all. Quite the opposite. In the long run, the employee funds will be so strong that no companies will escape them. My son, who is 19, says he would have voted for the social security funds if it weren't for the funds.

In letters to the editor to Aftonbladet, we are often asked to ask you if you and Agnetha are friends. Are you?

Yes, absolutely. We may not hang out much, but we have a very deep connection. There is really no rivalry between us. The connection has deepened during the years we have worked together.

You are 36 years old and slowly approaching the golden age of women. Do you often look at yourself in the mirror and check if you are as beautiful as you were yesterday?

No, I never do. By the way, I just think I am getting more and more beautiful. I don't care about new wrinkles.

She laughs with the usual wrinkling of her nose and laughs again when she says that the others in ABBA like her new solo album.

\- But how honest they are - you never know.

She says that she is sorry that Mikael Wiehe did not let her record ""The Girl and the Crow"" and that a double LP will be released for Christmas with all ABBA's singles plus two new songs. ABBA is turning ten. Next fall, a new ABBA LP will be released.

Five songs have already been recorded. She takes her Marlboro pack and says that she must go because she is going to have lunch with someone half past one.

The half-hour interview is over. She says: Many women only find themselves after 40.

\-But with the breakup with Benny, I found myself in a completely new situation. I had to stand on my own two feet. When you notice that you are fixing things, you become stronger, says Frida.

Aftonbladet, October 24, 1982

 

 Agnetha Fältskog talks about her ten years with ABBA

 

""All the personal attacks have made me strong""

 

Agnetha Fältskog, 32, after ten years with ABBA.

 

Now the image changes from an uninteresting blonde with the world's sexiest behind to a divorced mother of two with a brain and experiences to share

\-I hope it's like that. When I have met people for the first time, it takes at least one hour to correct the view they have of me. I must hold a defense speech each time, she says in this exclusive interview with Aftonbladet.

 

The new image of Agnetha:

 

She fights against the tabloids' gossip, she fights against drugs, she has started an acting career, she's preparing a solo career.

\-People who have read nothing but tabloids are led to believe I would be some sort of clueless person, she says. Yesterday I read in Min Värld an article about MY WHOLE LIFE! Where they had taken quotes I said when I was 18 and don't stand for who I am today. The headline was ""I was only a whimsical girl who happened to end up on Svensktoppen"". I have never said that, even as a young girl. Whimsical! It's a word I don't use.

The editor in chief Bengt Gustavsson at Hänt i veckan (a tabloid)  said he would just show their readers that you are just a simple phone operator from Jönköping that has succeeded.

\-Did he say that?! But what does that hint at? It hints at envy from his side, I think. I draw a sigh of relief each time I don't appear on the news posters. It's tough when you have children. Linda is soon ten years old. They understand what it says...

Did you read Kar de Mumma's attack on you? He wrote that you ""stand on top of the pyramid, deeply violated and hurt, and throw rocks at the former friends in media""?

\-Yes, I read it. I thought it was unnecessary.

She doesn't want to make any further comments about it. She is giving this interview because she wants to talk about her work. When I later ask about shared custody and if she has bodyguards at her house on Lidingö, she asks me to ask something else.

We meet at Polar's offices at Norrmalmstorg in Stockholm.

She's wearing some kind of short black boot, half unbuttoned, in which she walks around. She's wearing black pants and a red and black patterned sweater. She's biting her nails.

\-I'm seriously trying to quit smoking. But I notice that instead I bite my nails and nervously fidget. But maybe it'll pass.

She wants me to read the article for her before it's being printed. When I ask for her phone number, she hesitates.

\-What sign are you?

 

 

Aries. I was born on the 5th of April, I reply and she starts laughing.

\-Oh my god, the same date as me, she says and gives me her phone number if I promise not to give it to anyone else.

Was Gunnar Hellström a good teacher for you while filming?

\-He was very good. I'm not sure I would have managed it with another director. I don't even know yet if I did somewhat of a good job.

\-But Gunnar had such faith in me. And it was through him believing that I could manage it that I got some kind of confidence - as soon as I had gotten over the first fear.

Have you seen any of the movie?

\-I have seen short parts of it. But for me it's very difficult to see myself and I think it's good.

\-Not at all, says Björn Ulvaeus who passes through the room. Both laughs.

\-But filming was very tough with all the professional actors. At the same time, I love challenges like that.

Have you received any other movie offers?

\-Yes... a few. Two of them are being discussed. But I can't talk about them yet. But I can say that it's Gunnar and I who are talking about continuing working together. In one of the projects Swedish television is also involved.

If Hollywood contacts you, are you interested?

\-No, that doesn't appeal to me. I'd rather do some good things in Sweden.

About a month ago, in Aftonbladet, there was an article about Agnetha getting involved in the debate concerning drugs. She's a member of Riksförbundet för ett narkotikafritt samhälle (The national federation for a drug free society). She joined since a friend's son started doing drugs.

\-But it's something that concerns everyone, she says. You become especially aware and concerned when you have children of your own. I'm terrified of it. I believe in more information from schools. That parents become more aware of what happens to their children. I will do whatever I can to prevent my children from falling into it. I work actively by trying to affect those in my surroundings.

\-Drugs don't solve problems. It's by dealing with your problems that makes you strong.

What has ten years with ABBA meant to you?

\-Most of all I've learned to compromise since there are four of us in the group. It's a good experience.

I asked Björn & Benny the same question and think of how they instead answered that the best with these ten years with ABBA is that they haven't had to compromise like they did while in Hep Stars and Hootenanny singers.

Agnetha tells me that she's stopped taking singing lessons. She's stopped taking dancing classes and she's stopped jogging 3 kilometers twice a week.

\-I've been a bit lazy when it comes to those things. I've made the movie and have focused on that.

This spring she will record a solo album as well. Produced by Mike Chapman who has worked with Blondie and Smokie among others.

\-I have listened through a whole box of cassettes, but I haven't found a single song that I think is good. But maybe I have too high demands.

\-But Mike Chapman has promised to write a couple of hits. He seems to be very confident - in a positive way. He knows exactly the way he wants it to be.

Aren't you going to ask some Swedish artists to write some songs? For example, Ulf Lundell who you have worked with before.

\-I haven't thought of that. But it might be a good idea! I'm going to buy his album that everyone says is so good. Is it called ""Kär och galen"" (""In love and crazy"")?

Yes.

\-Well, then I can't use that as a name for my album, she says and laughs.

ABBA-Agnetha in love and crazy, would work on a news poster, I say.

I ask which book she's currently reading and she has just begun reading ""The bleeding heart"" by Marilyn French after having read Ingrid Berman's memoirs. On ABBA's new single Agnetha is actually singing about Marilyn French.

I ask her if she really is such a strong individual like she says in some interviews. She takes a long pause before she replies:

\-It depends. I'm very sensitive and easily cry, sometimes. But I am strong when it comes to unfair personal attacks on myself. Then I'm incredibly strong. I've always been and that's probably why I haven't cared about the rumors before.

What is luxury to you?

\-It feels luxurious if I can sleep late some mornings. To sleep until 9-10 is nice.

What do you prefer doing when you have time off?

\-I'm together with my children. We read and go for walks. I have also bought a big dog - a Leonberger called Hampus - who needs a lot of exercise. Often, I give the nanny time off when I am completely free. Then I want to take care of my children myself. Then we're together and go shopping and cook food.

Sometimes you've talked about that you come from a Real Family. Was that important to you?

\-I had a very secure childhood. And then it feels very unfair to my own children who I love the most, not being able to give them the sense of security I had myself. I see all divorces and especially ours as a big failure. It's my conscience hanging over me all the time.

\-At the same time, I'm grateful that things are as good as they are with me and Björn - as divorced. That we can talk with each other. Many can’t do so. When the children become some sort of weapon between the parents.

\-But once you've been through something like this, you constantly deal with a bad conscience. At least I am.

What kind of contact to you have with ""common people""?

I mostly only socialize with common people, she says and laughs because of the expression ""common people"".

\-I have a great need for that since I'm a common normal person myself - very much so actually.

1o7go86,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1o7go86/why_am_i_gaining/,Why am I gaining,"So I’ve been off and on Ozempic and Monjro for about a year. First ozempic, then got a reaction so then monjuro. 
I’ve made a LOT of changes. 
I don’t binge eat, I don’t have cheat days but cheat meals which isn’t so often. 
Even when I do I’m conscious about what I eat and even drink. 
I don’t drink soda, I don’t eat sweets, junk food, or drink alcohol or anything like that. I eat low calorie, high protein, low carb. 
I’m eating better than when I was taking monjuro. I understand it might not help me lose weight even more but maintain. 
I have had a shot in a month and in two weeks it says I gained 6 pounds. I’m in utter shock and confusion and so hurt and panicking. 
I understand when you eat something out of the ordinary it’s your body retaining water and all of that that it’s not real and it’ll go away. 
I’ve been constantly on a diets. The only reason I started the Ozempic/monjro is because I gained a ridiculous amount of weight over a short period of time. 
(thyroid is fine, no PCOS or anything, my thyroid was actually showing overactive for a few weeks but went to normal and currently awaiting appointments)
I’m also taking a medication for my acne that’s a diuretic and is a water pill. 
So I, am not, understanding, what’s going on?!

I’m constantly stressed now, I’m afraid to eat, but I HAVE to eat because I get extremely light headed. 
I eat grilled chicken, steak, shrimp, I incorporate veggies, everything is low calorie, fat free, light, I barley have carbs, even with coffees I have Almond milk and no sugars, sometimes I’ll have a pump of pumpkin, I drink water all day. 

What am I doing wrong? Someone please explain because I am very overwhelmed by this. I bought a bunch of new clothes because everything was so big and now what if I can’t fit into them !?!?",2,1760547679.0,diet,2,1.0,False
1o7gnp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1o7gnp5/rf_looking_for_heaven/,[RF] Looking for Heaven,"The doctor’s office was too quiet.
A ticking clock filled the silence between the words.

""I’m sorry, Mr. Hayes. Stage four, it's terminal. You may have a month, at most.""

The man sitting across from him didn’t move. His eyes stayed fixed on the floor.

""That’s ridiculous,” he said, his voice shaking. “You don’t know what you’re talking about. I can pay for the best treatment.""

""Money can’t buy time"", the doctor interrupted softly.

""Then get me your boss. Someone who actually knows what he’s doing.""

He stormed out before the doctor could answer.

Hours later, in a hallway of the hospital, he heard the same words again. Different voice, same story. He left without another word.
But as he walked past the reception desk, a nurse caught his attention.

""Don’t worry."", she said gently. ""Heaven exists.""

He froze, turning toward her with a flash of anger.

""What did you just say to me?""

She didn’t flinch and took his hand.

""There’s still time for redemption."", she whispered.

And then the world blurred. He saw flashbacks of his life: lies, greed, betrayal, the people he’d stepped on to climb higher. A thousand cruelties all coming back.
He ripped his hand away.

""I… I gotta go.""

He ended up in the park by the lake, the cold wind biting through his coat. He pulled his wallet from his pocket and threw the money, crumpled bills, into the dark water. A voice behind him broke the silence.

""You know, a lot of people could’ve used that money.""

He turned. A young woman stood a few feet away, watching him.

""What for?"", he said bitterly. ""We’re all slowly dying anyway. Or in my case… quickly.""

""Don’t you think life is beautiful? Every second of it?"", she asked.

""Far from it. Life is a black hole.""

""How about dinner at my place? Tonight.""

""What about it?""

""I could cook for you. A homemade meal. Someone who cares. Is that a black hole too?""

""Why would I want that?""

""Because no one wants to die alone.""

He sighed, tired.

""What do you want from me?""

""To help you.""

""There’s nothing you can do for me. Life’s a disease we’re all suffering from.""

""Nothing is hopeless. Miracles happen every day.""

""Fine"", he grudgingly said. ""I’ll come and see what your miracle looks like.""

She smiled faintly and wrote her address on his arm.

""Be there at six.""

That night, he found himself in a confessional booth.

""Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.""

""How long has it been since your last confession, my son?""

""I don’t know… I can’t remember.""

""That’s alright.""

""Father… how do you know there’s a heaven?""

""Faith!"", the priest said quietly.

""Something strange happened to me today"", the man murmured. ""Is it ever too late for redemption?""

The doorbell rang at exactly six.

""Hey, there you are!"", she said brightly. ""I was starting to wonder if you’d show up.""

""I was wondering that myself"", he said, holding out a bottle. ""I got curious about what you could do for me.""

""Wine! That wasn’t necessary, but thank you.""

""I don’t drink wine"", he said flatly. ""I’ll take a beer.""

Her house smelled like rosemary and garlic. He didn’t smile, just watched her move through the kitchen.

""So..."" he said finally. ""What’s the reason for all this?""

""Straight to business, huh? You seem to be standing on the edge of something deep, and I want to show you there’s still a reason to hold on. That life is still worth living.""

""Wait, you think I want to kill myself?""

""Isn’t that what this is about?""

""No. I’m dying. Cancer.""

Her expression broke.

""Oh my God… I’m so sorry. I thought""

""That I was just depressed?""

""I… yes.""

""Well, you weren’t wrong.""

He stood up and reached for his coat.

""I better go.""

""You don’t have to"", she said quietly.

""Thank you for the beer. And the awkward conversation, but I got my answer.""

""But dinner’s almost ready.""

He closed the door without looking back.

The next few days blurred. Work calls. Empty apartment. Some bottles. Still silence. He stopped at her door one night but couldn’t bring himself to knock. Later, at a bar, he picked a fight. He didn’t remember why. He remembered the fist, though, and the blood. When he came back, he was on her couch.

""Morning"", she said softly, a book in her lap.

""Ugh… my head"", he muttered. ""What happened?""

""You were drunk. Came here yelling that I was too nice. You were already bleeding.""

She handed him coffee.

""There you go, hun.""

He stared at her.

""What did you say last night?""

""You mean what you screamed at me?""

""No. Your answers to the screams. Why are you doing this?""

She closed her book with a sigh.

""Because I care. When people hurt, I hurt. When they’re happy, I feel it. It’s empathy. You’ve been drowning so long you’ve forgotten how to breathe. You just need someone to keep you from sinking.""

His eyes blurred from tears.

""You needed to hear that, didn’t you?"", she whispered.

He broke down, sobbing into her shoulder.

""I don’t want to die.""

""I know"", she said softly. ""You don’t have to worry about that right now.""

Weeks passed. Hospitals visits. Laughter and love. For the first time, he didn’t feel like a man dying but a man finally living. When his time came, the nurse from that first day was there again.

""Tell me"", he whispered. ""Is heaven real?""

She smiled.

""Does it matter?""

He thought of the girl. Of the spark of her smile, the warmth of her touch, the high of being loved.

""No"", he whispered. ""But what about her? Is it better to love and lose… than never love at all?""

The nurse didn’t answer. She just held his hand as the monitor beeped slower and slower.

At the funeral, the girl stood alone by the grave, trembling. Her knees gave out, and she fell to the ground, tears streaming down her face. The priest’s words drifted through the wind.

""For where there is love… there is heaven.""

And somewhere, maybe above, maybe within, he smiled.",1,1760547651.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

My fiancée is at home thinking I am running errands before my shift, and I am out here avoiding another argument. For real, I need to get this off my chest before I explode. We live in a one bedroom on the edge of the city, rent is 1,650, and it is due this coming Tuesday. We usually split things, I handle the rent, she does most utilities and groceries. This time, I missed rent. Not because I forgot, but because I thought I was being smart with money and it backfired.

Last Thursday, I got hit with an unexpected bill for my car, 1,200 for a repair I could not push off. My shifts have been weird lately, rotating hours, overtime one week, short the next. I figured I could make it up quick, so I played on an online casino, the platform I sometimes use for roulette when my buddies are talking trash. I know, I know, sounds dumb, but it felt like one of those times it could actually help. I put in 200, hit a streak, and came out with just over 2,000 CAD. I thought, great, car repair covered and still enough to throw at rent. The platform sent me a confirmation at 9 a.m., paraphrase, “Withdrawal initiated, allow up to five business days.” I even screenshotted it because it felt like proof that I had things handled.

The problem is the money did not hit yet, and the rent account went short. Yesterday morning my phone pinged, paraphrase, “Insufficient funds for scheduled transfer.” My fiancée saw the alert on the joint account and asked what happened. I said, quote, “It is just the timing of the paycheck,” which is technically true, but not the full story. She looked at me with that mix of disbelief and disappointment that hits harder than yelling. I tried to explain but ended up snapping instead, saying, quote, “I got it handled, no cap,” and left for work early just to get away from it.

The worst part is she has heard this pattern before. My old man used to gamble too, and I always swore I was not like him. But I caught myself doing the same little rituals before spinning, touching the same sticky note on my dashboard, telling myself I was luckier when the radio was off. That realization messed me up. Now I am sitting here thinking how stupid it was to risk rent money on something that even felt familiar in a bad way.

There is another layer too. I had a health scare two weeks ago, a test that came back unclear, and I think the stress from that pushed me into this dumb “quick fix” mindset. I just wanted to feel in control, like I could handle everything, rent, car, bills, wedding savings. Instead, I made things worse. My fiancée has every right to be mad, but she does not know the full story yet. She thinks I just forgot to move money around.

So I am stuck on this decision right now. Option one, tell her everything tonight, about the platform, the win, the pending withdrawal, and the car bill. Take the hit, admit I screwed up, and deal with the fallout. Option two, wait a few more days, hope the withdrawal clears before Tuesday, pay rent, and then tell her after like it was no big deal. The first one risks our trust, the second one risks it even more, but slower. I feel like either way I lose.

TLDR, I won 2,000 CAD on an online casino to cover a car repair, the withdrawal is delayed, rent got missed, and now I have to decide if I tell my fiancée the truth tonight or wait and hope it clears before she finds out everything.

I had a strange experience yesterday and I’m not sure if I’m overreacting.

I am an international student in Australia. I was eating some skewers at a train station when an older white man (like around 45 old) came up to me and asked, “Is this good?” I said it was nice, and he started asking if I was Chinese. Then he told me he had been to China many times and even showed me that he had WeChat Chinese app on his phone.

We ended up on the same train and got off at the same stop. He greeted me again and started asking about my studies, where I was going, and so on. Then he asked to add me on WeChat.

After adding me, he asked if he could buy me a coffee. I said no thanks I don’t drink coffee in pm, and he suggested chocolate instead. We got iced chocolate drinks together and talked for a bit. He asked if I wanted to have lunch or dinner sometime, but I said I was busy with exams. He replied, “That’s okay, you have my WeChat now, you can message me anytime.” During the conversation, he put his hands on my shoulders like three times and said you are such a nice person.

Before I left, he asked where I was from, said he was born in Australia, and then started asking if I was planning to go back to China after graduation. I said yes, and he told me I shouldn’t go back — that working here is great, and that getting a visa and permanent residency is the “first step.”

If someone had told me I'd ever talk about something like this, I would've laughed. But here I am, typing this with shaky hands.

It started on one of those strangely warm October Saturdays when the air smells like dry leaves and dust. My friend Petar and I decided to hike up Djendem Hill. Just to drink some coffee at the top and look at the city.
I've always liked that place. There's something heavy about it, old and alive somehow. The Turks called it ""Djendem"" which means ""hell."" My grandmother used to tell me that at night you could hear footsteps up there, but you should never ask who it is. I laughed back then. I would not now.
It was around noon. The sun was strong, the air was trembling, and everything was quiet in a strange way. We sat on the rocks near the antenna and watched Plovdiv spread beneath us like a toy city. After a while, Petar went silent. He squinted and nodded toward the trees.
""Do you see that down there?"" he asked.

At first I thought it was a man. But the more I stared, the less human it looked. I could not make out any details, no clothes, no face, no reflection from the sun. It wasn't just black. It was the kind of black that eats the light around it, like a hole in the world.

Then I smelled it. Burnt metal, mixed with something rotten. Petar cursed and said we should leave. I wanted to move, but my body wouldn’t listen. The thing turned toward us. Not like a person. It didn't move, just shifted, like space itself bent the wrong way.
The air suddenly felt heavy. Everything went dead silent, no birds, no wind, even the city noise disappeared.

Then came the sound. Not really a voice, more like a whisper scraping against metal. I could not understand the words, but it felt like they were echoing inside my head instead of my ears.

And then it was gone. No movement, no sound, just empty air where it had been. Petar was already halfway down the path, yelling at me to move. I finally did.

When we reached the bottom, neither of us said a word. He looked pale, like he hadn't slept in days. Then he said quietly, ""Don’t call me. I do not want to remember this"", and walked away.
The next day I texted him. No answer. Two days later I heard he'd been taken to the hospital. His mother said he woke up screaming at night, saying the black one was standing by his window.

I haven't been the same since. At night, when I turn off the lights, I keep seeing something move at the edge of my vision. Shapes darker than the dark. Sometimes, if I listen closely, I can still hear that faint metallic whisper, like breath on the back of my neck.

And the worst part?
Last week I was standing on my balcony. You can see the whole hill from there. Right on the top, where we sat that day, I saw it again. A black figure, still as a statue, watching the city below.

Just wanted to follow up on a few comments as the original was a late night desperate post, that did not include a lot detail or back story.

* I am step MOM.
* Bio parents are both openly discussing with their child about the clothing choices as well, including yesterday. Step daughter says dad is not ""allowed"" to say anything or he is a misogynist. My kids and I have very open, relatively great relationships. I often follow up, go more into depth, hold them accountable, while bio parents can sometimes be hands off or reactionary. They tend to both be avoidant. This has caused a lot of pain for my step daughter in the past, which is partially why she is in therapy along with some really unhealthy coping mechanisms (ever heard of SHED twitter? It is HORRIFIC).
* She currently has no access to the internet, other than what she is able to sneak - she has a flip phone only and a locked down school computer.
* We have been discussing this topic at length for weeks and it started with concern for safety while walking in this neighborhood. I absolutely try to make it clear that there is nothing shameful, and that I know pedo's will be around regardless and clothing is not to blame. I do often feel like I would be neglectful to let them wander around with no care about what they are wearing. They have specific places they can go - like to coffee and back, etc. They agreed to try and cover private parts but I for some reason never anticipated things would escalate in other areas, like going out with Dad to a therapy session.
* I have spoken with her extensively about traumas or SA. She is very open and has never been harmed in that way.
* She buys the clothes with her Mom I believe. Although she may have bought something with me at goodwill and I didn't check. This is a relatively new issue (maybe been going on a few weeks)

I am by no means conservative, but I was a neglected child and teen. I want to be there for them. I care. I want to have hard conversations and help to keep them safe. I do not want to shame them and I appreciate everyone's feedback and messages.",0,1760547435.0,TwoXChromosomes,4,0.5,False

The Tide B01IAINL1I Travel Sink Packets caught my interest primarily because of their size and purpose. Each packet is compact, measuring just a little over three inches in height and weighing a mere 0.63 ounces. The first thing that struck me was how easy it was to toss these into my carry-on bag without taking up any noticeable space. As someone who frequently travels for work and leisure, these packets seemed perfect for me. They’re ideal for maintaining clean clothes on short trips without the hassle of carrying bulky detergent bottles.  

**Powerful Cleaning, Even in Small Amounts**  
Despite their size, these little packets pack a punch. I tested the product while on a weekend camping trip, and it effectively tackled stubborn dirt and grease on my clothes. The detergent features Tide's Acti-Lift formula, letting it remove stains and odors as well as its larger liquid detergent counterparts. I particularly noticed its excellent performance on my gym gear and even on a coffee stain from an earlier mishap. The cleaning power was comparable to a full-sized detergent, yet it came in such a small and convenient package.  

[Check Tide B01IAINL1I price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b01iainl1i/)  

**Ease of Use in Any Setting**  
Using these packets couldn’t be easier. All I had to do was fill a sink with warm water, tear open one of the packets, and mix it into the water. The entire process felt seamless. Hand washing can sometimes be a tedious chore, but the detergent dissolved immediately, making it hassle-free. It also worked wonderfully well with limited water resources, which made it a game changer during my trip to a remote cabin with minimal access to utilities.  

**Good Aspects**  
- Compact and lightweight—perfect for travel.  
- Effectively removes tough stains and odors.  
- Simple and convenient to use with just a sink and water.  

**Safe Ingredients for Environmentally Conscious Users**  
One of the standout features I appreciated was the brand’s attention to safety, particularly for septic systems. The packets don’t contain phosphates, ensuring they’re safer for the environment compared to many traditional detergents. While traveling to rural areas or camping where septic tanks or eco-friendly facilities are common, having this reassurance added peace of mind. For a household that tries to make eco-conscious choices, the lack of harmful ingredients is an important plus.  

**Caveats**  
- Only sufficient for smaller loads; may not work well for larger families.    
- The 3-load supply feels limited for those looking for extended use.  

**Other Options in the Market**  
From my experience with other travel detergents, the Tide Travel Sink Packets hold their ground firmly. Competitors like Travelon Laundry Soap Sheets also cater to travelers, offering a dehydrated sheet solution. While these are light and space-saving, they sometimes struggle to dissolve as quickly as these packets. Another alternative would be the Woolite Travel Detergent packets, which are gentle on delicate fabrics but might lack the deep-cleaning power of the Acti-Lift formula. Compared to these options, I found Tide’s version to be the most balanced, excelling in stain removal and ease of use without compromising travel convenience.  

**Quality for Price**  
Given the compact size and effectiveness, these packets are incredibly efficient for their price point. While other travel detergents may occasionally undercut Tide in price, they tend to underdeliver on quality. For me, the value lies in knowing that I can rely on just one packet to clean a load of hand-washed laundry without compromising the freshness or stain removal. It doesn’t feel like an unnecessary expenditure when it guarantees cleanliness even during travel.

1o7gfyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1o7gfyr/why_is_linkedin_reach_down/,Why is Linkedin reach down?,"Your best LinkedIn posts are disappearing into a black hole. And no, it’s not because people don’t care.

Let me explain what’s actually happening.

You write something real – something that took courage, something with genuine insight about the messy bits of work and life. You hit publish. And then… crickets. Maybe 150 views if you’re lucky.

But Janet from Accounts posts about her new coffee mug and suddenly she’s got 35,000 impressions and 400 comments.

WTAF?

LinkedIn’s playing it safe. Really safe.

The platform wants to be where professionals gather without drama, without controversy, without anything that might make HR departments nervous. Which sounds reasonable… until you realise that “safe” often means suppressing anything with real emotion or substance.

Touch on personal struggles, systemic problems, or anything remotely charged? The algorithm doesn’t pause to understand your message. It just spots certain language patterns and thinks “nope, too risky.”

Your content gets shunted off for human review. And whilst it’s waiting in that digital holding pen, it’s basically invisible. Hidden from most of your network. Buried in searches. Gone.

This is why you’ve got 8,000 connections but your posts are only reaching about 200 impressions.

So what can you do? 


✅Choose your language carefully
I know, I know – it feels like self-censorship. But think of it as becoming a better storyteller. Sometimes constraints breed creativity.

✅Open with the insight, not the emotion
What will someone take away? Lead with that. The algorithm loves content that teaches something concrete.

✅Pull people in gently
Save the strong opinions for once you’ve got their attention. Start with something curious rather than combative. Add layers as you go.

✅Keep showing up with substance
Just because the platform’s being difficult doesn’t mean we abandon the meaningful stuff. We just need to be craftier about delivery.

✅Comment, comment, comment
That’s where real business happens anyway. Leave insightful well-thought-out comments on someone else’s post. Build genuine connections there.

The Linkedin game’s changed. We can either spend our energy moaning about it or we can get strategic.

Oh and if it’s all a bit too much for you, drop me a messsge and ask me how l can help. Especially if you’re an accountant, financial advisor or mortgage broker. ",0,1760547181.0,linkedin,3,0.5,False

I (36M) have been single for 4 years since my last long-term relationship. That breakup broke me so hard that I reshaped my life not to fall in love again, unless love falls on me; truly, deeply, madly.

Last year, I met someone (34F) after joining a new team at work. Eventually, she moved to a different team, and that’s when we started chatting more, first about work, then about personal things. Our conversations helped us get to know each other better, and I started developing feelings for her.

She is the most kind and honest person I have met in a long time. She understands me very well, although that credit goes to her empathy, not any special feeling for me.

A couple of months back, she joined another company. I asked her out for lunch, our first time meeting one-on-one outside of work. I made that plan since we wouldn’t be seeing each other every day anymore, as we no longer worked at the same place. It felt like a good chance to spend some time together and talk.

A month later, I planned another outing to a fancy coffee shop outside the city. We had a great time, but when I paid the bill, she insisted on splitting it because it was a ""hangout”. I think she started to realize around then that my feelings might be romantic.

Lately, she’s still friendly and warm, but she rarely initiates our chats anymore. When I message her, she’s enthusiastic, which is her nature in general, and she always agrees to the plans I make. For example, we even bought tickets to a concert that’s almost a year away, and she reassured me that she really wants to go.

However, when I asked her to plan the next outing, since she wanted to pay next time, she never did. That made me think maybe she isn’t interested. But just when I start to lose hope, she does something unexpected. Last week, she asked me twice to go for a walk during our lunch break, as our workplaces are still in the same area. We talked a lot and had a genuinely good time.

She’s told me before that she doesn’t have the energy for the effort it takes to find a relationship, which is why she’s single. She’s also mentioned having anxiety about making choices. I imagine that affects how she approaches relationships or choosing a partner, too.

I don’t know if what I feel is infatuation or something real, but I want to find out. She is a person worth waiting for. I’m not in a rush, and I was doing fine with my single life. But now I’m torn. Part of me wants to give her the time and space she might need, and part of me wonders if I should start stepping back to protect myself from getting hurt.

To sum it up: Should I get distant from her to move on, or should I stay patient and give her more time to make up her mind?",1,1760546919.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Toronto Raptors vs. Boston Celtics Preseason Showdown: A Tale of Two (Un)Cages**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a preseason clash that’s less “regular season” and more “let’s see who trips over their own shoelaces first.” The Toronto Raptors (3-1 preseason) and Boston Celtics (2-1) meet at TD Garden, where the Celtics are favored despite recently losing to the Raptors in a 107-105 exhibition. Let’s break this down with the precision of a stat head and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The Celtics are priced at **-150 to -160** (decimal: \~1.56) across most books, implying a **62-64% chance to win**. The Raptors, meanwhile, sit at **+240 to +255** (decimal: \~2.47-2.53), suggesting a **28-40% implied probability**. The spread favors Boston by **4.5 to 5 points**, while the total is locked at **230.5 points** (even money).

Key stats? The Raptors have won three straight, including that narrow victory over Boston, while the Celtics’ lone loss came at the hands of… the Raptors. Boston’s roster, though, has been a Jenga tower of changes: Jayson Tatum (ACL), Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porziņģis, and Al Horford are out, replaced by Anfernee Simons and Chris Boucher. Toronto’s added Brandon Ingram and RJ Barrett, turning their squad into a “let’s see what sticks” experiment.

### News Digest: Injuries, Roster Riddles, and Coachy Complaining

Boston’s Joe Mazzulla has made it clear: he’d rather practice in a bubble than play preseason games. “I’d rather have a month of training camp,” he said, probably while sipping a $12 latte. With only one exhibition left, expect **rotations**—some players will go full “I’m here, I’m not here,” while others might as well be on vacation.

Toronto’s Scottie Barnes is the closest thing to a “reliable” star, but even he’s facing a Raptors defense that’s been **as porous as a sieve in a monsoon**. Their recent wins? A 113-112 thriller over the Wizards and a 107-105 squeaker against Boston. The Raptors are the underdog, but they’ve got the swagger of a team that’s been playoff-less for three years and is now saying, “Watch us.”

1o7g8hz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchemyBeauty/comments/1o7g8hz/explore_the_best_d_cell_battery_for_power_and/,Explore the Best D Cell Battery for Power and Safety Energizer,"From the moment I started using the Energizer E95BP-2 D Batteries, they have proven themselves to be both reliable and convenient. Batteries might not seem that exciting, but when you're juggling flashlights during a power outage or trying to calm down a toddler by reviving a favorite noisy toy, you realize how essential dependable batteries really are. Energizer touts these as long-lasting alkaline batteries, and after testing them across different devices, I must admit they live up to the claim… mostly.

**Durability and Performance**  
These batteries are built for endurance, and that’s evident in how they handled my high-drain devices. My son’s motorized toy train, which eats through batteries faster than I consume coffee, ran smoothly for weeks without showing signs of slowing down. I also tested them in a powerful flashlight during a weekend camping trip. Despite overnight use, the flashlight stayed incredibly bright, which showed just how well the batteries powered through extended use. Energizer advertises a shelf life of up to 10 years, and though I obviously haven’t waited that long to test it fully, it’s reassuring for anyone stocking up on essentials for emergencies.  

**Everyday Utility**  
Whether it's a radio, a camping flashlight, or even a portable fan for those summer road trips, these batteries consistently powered everything I threw at them with ease. You’d think all batteries perform the same, but trust me, when you switch from an off-brand to these, the difference becomes pretty stark. Plus, having two batteries included in the pack means you're immediately set for most devices without needing an extra trip to the store.  

**Highlights**  
- Long-lasting performance in high-drain and everyday devices  
- Built to last with a 10-year shelf life  
- Contributes to peace of mind during emergencies  

[Check Energizer E95BP-2 price on Amazon.](https://stylistexperts.com/p/b0044d44i8/)  

**Design Overview**  
These don’t rock the boat design-wise because, well, they're batteries. But what I did notice while holding them is their robust construction. They feel heavier and more solid compared to some cheaper options I’ve tried in the past. The no-leak promise from Energizer was another point of relief since I’ve had batteries ruin devices due to leakage in the past. Leaving these in a flashlight or remote control overnight didn't result in any corrosion, which scores serious points with me.  

**Drawbacks**  
While the Energizer E95BP-2 D Batteries are amazing in most aspects, they’re not completely without flaws.  

- The price is slightly above generic brands, which can push budget-conscious users to look elsewhere.  
- I noticed their performance slope off with extremely high-drain devices if run continuously for several days. Although they last longer than bargain brands, they might not always justify the cost for such extreme usage.  

**Hurdles**  
- Limited cost advantage over cheaper alternatives.  
- Struggles with extreme prolonged usage.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing these batteries with Duracell D batteries, it’s safe to say the performance gap isn’t huge. Both have robust power outputs, but the main differentiator is in pricing and shelf life. Energizer’s claim of a 10-year shelf life slightly edges over Duracell's similar offerings, but only niche users aiming for long-term storage might notice this factor. On the flip side, some other brands like Amazon Basics D batteries provide a more affordable option, though you'd probably find yourself replacing them more frequently. While those alternatives exist for general use, serious users needing reliability will appreciate Energizer's craftsmanship.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
If you’re someone who’s tired of swapping out batteries frequently or finds themselves always reaching for a dependable brand, then Energizer delivers value for the money spent. Although there are cheaper alternatives, you’ll likely use two packs of bargain-brand batteries for every pack of Energizers. For me, that made it worth the initial cost because it reduces the hassle of constant replacements. Their reliability in emergencies, such as when our power went out or during camping trips, truly made them a worthwhile investment.

It was a simple plan, though not without risk. Beno Ablancourt would wait for his father Alvize to break from work and go upstairs for his night cap, undeviatingly a glass of buttered warm brandy enjoyed with a menthol cigarette. Then, while the senior Ablancourt indulged himself, Beno would sneak into the cold room and hide under a sheet on the autopsy slab, there to wait for Alvize’s return.



You may be wondering why.



Alvize, evincing his generation’s casual cruelty masquerading as good fun, and buoyed by the rationale that cleverness conquered all grievance against it, gave a script purportedly written by Beno to a classmate, specifically that classmate of Beno’s who read the morning announcements over the school PA system each day. Along with those verses allegedly penned by Beno, Alvize proffered to the morning announcer forty dollars in cash to ensure that the poem be read. The classmate then read aloud “Beno Ablancourt’s Confession” at a time when the whole school’s captive audience was all but guaranteed:



*You know me as Beno, your confederate, dearest confrère*

*I now disclose to you my secret, of which you’ll have been unaware*

*I have my predilections, some ranked first, some the last*

*But I admit my favorite of the former is to drool over Mrs. Gulyash’s ass*



Rather more spiteful than clever, but there it was.



You may also be wondering about the owner of the “ass” over which Beno’s classmates suspected him of drooling.



Mrs. Gulyash, the school librarian, was a scoliotically sloped geriatric best known for being shorter than all the students. 



But one should like a bit more color:



When the Gulyashes still lived in Bratislava, her husband had run afoul of the ŠtB (the Czechoslovakian secret police responsible for monitoring anti-communist dissidents). He was found guilty of “subversion of the republic” and then sent to Leopoldov State Prison, where he died in what might be best described as murky circumstances. This is all to the point that Mrs. Gulyash had suffered a long run of rotten luck. Her chronic psychological injury could’ve done without the added insult of Alvize’s lurid verse.



Another thing about Mrs. Gulyash that, if not interesting, was at least pertinent to Alvize’s poetical fraud, was that she was, by any aesthetic convention, quite unattractive; that unattractiveness, one might guess, was inclusive of the whole of her body, which of course encompassed her buttocks. At any rate, the notion of Beno staring at Mrs. Gulyash’s rear end was thought by both Beno’s fellow high-schoolers and almost all of his teachers to be quite funny.



Beno recognized that jump-scaring the Ablancourt elder in the deathly venue of the mortuary cold room was a marked escalation in their prank war, which had otherwise kept to a regularized brinkmanship. And yes, Beno gave his old man a heap of grace for the fact of his single-parenthood. But the public humiliation had been a bridge too far. 



Enough was enough. This time the old man was asking for it.



**Lying in Wait**



It was just about 8:30 p.m. and Beno was laid on the autopsy slab, covered with a mortuary sheet. And though the cold room was rather brisk, a radiant warmth bloomed in Beno’s heart at the thought of his father’s comeuppance, at the look of fright he imagined he’d see on the old man’s face.



That was enough, for the moment, to keep his teeth from chattering.



After a short spell spent waiting, Beno recognized the sandy swish of his father’s loafers shuffling across the floor; he fought the instinctive urge to direct his head toward that noise. There would be a reward for his patience, and Beno would be able, by looking through the beady hole he’d torn through the sheet, to surveil the elder Ablancourt soon enough.



The shuffle and swish drew nearer the embalming instruments set upon the dissecting tray. Beno thought he might die (ha!) from giddy anticipation. 



As seen through the hole in the sheet, Beno’s father was backlit by the bright white examination lamps, and was at first distinguishable only as a pocket of shadow fringed in edges of light. Beno readied himself and, not having picked his moment so much as his moment having picked him, prepared to break loose and leap at Alvize from under the sheet. 



But then, an interruption: 



Beno was arrested by the beady ratchet of a pull chain being yanked. He stopped cold as his father’s form lit up and came wholly into his line of sight under the secondary light.



What was Beno looking at? At first he didn’t understand. Perhaps the frayed border of his improvised peephole obscured his field of vision. Why would his father be naked inside the cold room? But there Alvize was, right between the two autopsy tables, wearing his graying and age-spotted birthday suit. And still in his penny loafers.



Beno had no clue what his father was doing. He also had no idea what he himself should do now. Funny how a little extra light and a few clockface turns can send the whole world topsy-turvy.



Or maybe it was not funny at all. One supposes it must be rather a matter of perspective.



•



Alvize picked the scalpel up off the dissecting tray. He turned and pulled the mortuary sheet from over Mrs. Bernuzzi’s corpse.



He had never met Carolina Bernuzzi while she was alive. Alvize knew this town and its inhabitants fairly well, though, and Bernuzzi had had a reputation. 



The truth would out, at any rate, no matter how well the dead’s secrets were once kept. However deeply a decedent was buried inside their plot, their hidden shame could not follow them into the dirt.



This unearthing of secrets had very much to do with Alvize’s feeding of Mother Ghoul. 



When he fed Mother Ghoul, she fed him in turn. And while he suckled her teat, he would glimpse the secrets that her tongue read from the corpses’ flesh he had fed to her. The human body spoke, even in death, if one could but learn to listen.



Alvize reviewed his flaying of Mrs. Bernuzzi’s nude cadaver. He was satisfied with his work; it was methodical, the slices deft and precise, incised as if by the hand of a plastic surgeon, careful that quite few contractures and adhesions should be left behind. Alvize cut another length from Carolina Bernuzzi’s thigh with his scalpel, taking up where he’d left off. He pulled away a pearly strip glistening with faschia, and shuddered, feeling the satisfactions of competency and higher purpose that only the true craftsman can feel.



**Necropolis**



Beno thought maybe someone was forcing his father to do what he was doing. There were such analogues in both fiction and fact, of course; the father coopted into political assassination under the Damoclean threat of his daughter’s execution, women marrying scoundrels who promised to pay off parents’ debts—there was a whole panoplied canon of deeds done under duress.



Beno internally made the case for his father being unwillingly coerced. Because the unacceptable alternative was that Alvize himself chose, of his own free will, to desecrate a woman’s corpse (and for some reason, while he was in the buff). And the only available explanation for that was necessarily criminal, or possibly occult, or some other profound combination of deviancies Beno thought his father incapable of.



A thousand troubled thoughts assailed Beno in his foxhole under the sheet; he squeezed the whole of himself shut against their intrusion (stopped up his airway and bore down on his gut and shut up his eyes and everything else he could do to seal himself off) as if the fact of his father’s perversion could only be made real by the thought of it invading Beno’s body from without. But the harder Beno tried to push out those possibilities, the wilder the explanations arisen in his mind: sex games and necrophilia, cannibalism and human sacrifice, violence and sacrilege in the cause of some heathen black rite.



His mind was swiftly subjugated by the tyranny of his father’s sins, real or imagined. And when Beno realized the futility of fighting the whole ocean of possibility with his objections’ single oar, he released his diaphragm and all other of his bodily tensions. And when he did, and acclimated to the deathly clinic’s frigid silence, Beno realized: his father was no longer inside the room.



•



Alvize continued down the stone stairs and into the stone corridor, carrying cuts of foul meat sliced from Bernuzzi’s cadaver. The walls perspired sog, sweating the deep earth’s damp from their mineral pores.



She waited at the furthest tenebrous reach of the dungeon. Tallow candles melted into puddles of wax, fragrant with rancid beef and butter; they pooled around her ample frame. She, too, looked to have melted somewhat—the tallow’s flames danced across tumorous growths that were like dripping lumps of unrendered lard, her sweat-slick skin liquid and sallow under the light, fluid filling the saddlebags of her folds of fat. 



It looked like Mother Ghoul and the melted tallow might blend.



Pests-as-pets scurried past, their fur patchy and bald from mange, fleabitten ears budding with lesions, dried blood growing like barnacles on their auricles. Their bodies were swollen and fat; longer and bigger than all other earthly rats. Hearing Alvize enter the room, they shrieked and capered over Mother Ghoul’s lumpy body. 



Whether they did so in excitement or fear Alvize never could tell.



•



Beno’s lips trembled and his Adam’s apple bobbed dry in the catch of his throat. What was this place, this dank prison into which he’d followed his father? What was this place, hidden behind and below the family funeral home walls? 



He shone a light from his phone and saw the passage’s stones moist with lichenous exudate, like the walls had developed an ecological chest cold. A series of primitive symbols were chiseled into the walls, eroded by damp and by time. The ceiling was raftered with speleothems, giving the roof the appearance of a canker-sored mouth. Beno saw a frieze depicting scenes of man-sized rats feasting on flesh, and of rat-like humans doing the same. 



A fluid orange glow wavered ahead of him; he quickly shut the light on his phone. The reek of rancid viscera and fat-rich smoke smacked him right on the nose. He heard a frenzy of skittering and shrieking; he felt an omen’s throbbing pulse; darkly premonition worked itself under his skin, wending his veins, removing itself to the blood of his heart’s chambers.



At that moment Beno understood the paradox of witness: 



He knew he would not stop himself from seeing what he did not want to see. 



Beno was due for a reckoning. So are we all, at one point or another.



**The Drip** 



“I want living flesh next time,” Mother Ghoul said. Her jowls were punctured where black abcesses had oozed and broken through her skin, leaving holes wide enough to show the blooming microbial culture layering her sharp teeth. Her eyes looked strange under the flames’ woozy flicker; dark irises clouded over with cataracts of strange malignance, blighted the black and yellow of a bruised and rotten lemon. 



“I know, Mother Ghoul,” Alvize said.



“And the children are hungry for living flesh, too.” 



“Yes, I know. I am doing what I can.”



Mother Ghoul hmphed.



“May I feed you?” he asked.



She might’ve harped further on her dissatisfaction, but as it was she was starved. The sinkhole of her mouth prepared to suck its prize into her gullet. Alvize dangled Bernuzzi’s flesh over Mother Ghoul’s maw. Her nose chuffed at the meat, tongue greedily waggled. She looked like a killer whale nipping herring from the palm of a wetsuited trainer’s hand. 



A rat resembling a Scottish Terrier (and nearing the same in size) leapt at the dangling meat. Alvize threw a hard elbow into the freak thing’s flying jaw; the dog-rat scuttered against the momentum of a tumble but couldn’t stop its face from cracking open against the sharp edge of a stone.



The vicious hit hardly drew Mother Ghoul’s notice.



“I am mindful of your hunger. I have not forgotten your hunger and I am, as always, eager to satisfy it,” Alvize said.



“Yes, so long as you benefit from it! Rentseeker. That’s what you are, a rentseeker. You forget, dear Alvize, my longevity. One day, as you rot in your bed of worms, I’ll be stirring your progeny into my stew. Better to treat me well!”



These threats were old hat. “I only urge caution, Mother. Only caution.” Alvize lowered a strip of dead flesh into her maw. “The world is changing, and it’s not as simple as it was before. There are eyes everywhere. Watching—always, there are always interlopers watching now, eager meddlers. Trespass, Mother—we must guard against it.”



She slurped at the meat fatly folded on her tongue, gnashed her needled teeth. Phlegm percolated into her sinuses, bubbling as she chewed. Alvize didn’t understand how her lips could so loudly smack.



“Flesh, Alvize—I want living flesh!” She ejected meat particles from her mouth as she spoke.



Alvize’s body yearned for the secrets of Mother’s tongue; he drew in toward her like a vine reaching for the sun. 



These had been trying years, these last, spent skirting the exposure of digitalia’s creeping kingdom. How could Alvize keep pace with Mother Ghoul’s hunger, intensifying as it did with every fresh feeding? He wondered if flesh-eaters such as she could slide into senility; he wondered if she was losing her wits. The delirium of starvation, perhaps? 



But then how to account for her remaining so hugely fat…



And then the rats, the rats, the rats…



The rats grew larger, ever larger, killing and eating each other more than they ever had done, refusing the barrels of rendered meat Alvize brought to cure their inanition. They snapped at each other in ravenous frenzy, as hungry as their ghoulish guardian for the flavor of a beating heart. 



And that hunger, due the sparsity of these latter days, lessened the frequency of Mother Ghoul’s shared visions. Alvize was desperate, terribly, terribly desperate, for a fix of that peculiar narcotic. Once the skeletons in the crypt’s closet were revealed, there could be no greater titillation. Reliving the secrets that were once housed by and now outlasted the body of the dead, the scopophilic pleasure of raiding the past—that uncanny gift was only Mother Ghoul’s to grant.



She finished the last morsel. A sigh preceded a series of pungent eructations. “I suppose you’ll want your fill now, too?”



Alvize shoegazed—there was always such burning shame in his longing. He’d developed a Delphic dependency, but hadn’t the gumption to petition the oracle unprompted. “Yes,” he said quietly.



Mother Ghoul sinisterly smiled, prepared as always to give him his gift.



•



Beno’s sneakers felt sealed to the dirt floor of the catacomb, legs somehow syrupy and heavy as lead all at once, his fingers sapped of tactile sensation, insensibly gripping the roughhewn, rocky edge of the secret chamber’s ingress. He kept his whole body hidden, save for his keeking eyes, of course.



He did not understand—or was perhaps unable, considering the perversity such that comprehension presently required—what he was watching, though his brain ably interpreted each visual datum, mechanically categorized and catalogued every foul act. If someone were to search the history of Beno’s witness, his flight from reason notwithstanding, that searcher might read the record of events as follows:



Beno saw a great-statured and greasy, hugely fat woman—a mountain of gristly drippings, sloppy and slippery mound of meat. Her jowly face was fissured with weeping tissual holes, her teeth like sawdust-and-rust-smeared marking awls. Her eyes were spider-webbed a yellow-black opacity, and her meaty stink invaded Beno’s person so deeply that he could feel the stench curling around his ears before seeping into the marrow of his skull.



Beno watched her lift her billowing gut with her ugly and malformed and fat fingers. He saw his still-naked father supine on the mudded floor, the old man’s eyes glassy black orbs, candle flames dancing within, pools of black fire staring up at the stalactitic ceiling, at the drooping formations dancing, too, in the spiny dark above.



And then, from the malodorous nest below the hag’s mighty gut, wretched marsupium slick with stink and greasy fat, came a limb, a protuberance, a feature of mutant anatomy, that looked like…well, what did it look like?



It looked like a forearm with an elbow where the hand should be, a nipple studding the end of the joint. The elbow-mount mammilla leaked something that in the candle-lit darkness dribbled viscid and black.



Then, horribly, horribly, oh so horribly, the ill-formed limb lowered, so the nipple hove over Alvize’s mouth (oh God, oh no, Beno’s father’s waiting mouth). And then Alvize’s lips puckered, his tongue folded into an envelope of papillae, eager mouth suckling at the air as the nipple lowered to his lips and tongue, and—



•



As Alvize suckled, his body filled up with the dead Bernuzzi’s memories, the sensational chronicle of her past’s closest-kept secrets. And even overfull of that otherly remembrance, Alvize still felt so light, so light that he felt himself floating off, floating as a fallen leaf driven on the wind. Inside his own mind, Alvize was for the moment the unliving Bernuzzi, wallowing as her ghost in fragments of her past.



Alvize was Bernuzzi, snorting cocaine in a dingy bathroom while disco pounded outside the toilet stall door. Alvize was Bernuzzi, swilling bottom-shelf gin before passing out on the bathroom floor. Alvize was Bernuzzi, stamping scarlet letters on those tramps who traipsed up the corporate ladder in increments of the length of their spread legs. Alvize was Bernuzzi, beating her son with a wooden spoon for being too slow turning down the TV, spiking her niece’s coffee with enough levonorgestrel to flush out her bastard, kicking her husband’s dog with the spike of her high heel, spitting in food, slaying a pedestrian in a drunkenly-driven hit-and-run—oh what tender and terrible shame and sin had inhabited this evil woman!



Of course, Alvize had had a feeling. His sense of evil was keenly developed by his experience in the field.



And then, when he’d drank his fill, he lay still on the floor between Mother Ghoul’s feet, within the swaddle of her beefy thighs, stuporous (as if opiated into the torpor of a narcotic haze) and struggling to remain a ghost within Bernuzzi’s sinister memories, which to him were like shameful but ecstatically pleasurable dreams.



•



Beno ran. Oh God, how quickly Beno ran.



**Postmortem**



Beno had never before noticed how low the lamp hung over the kitchen table, how feeble the light glowed beneath the pendant’s stained glass shade, the sparse luminance dying before it grew beyond the dusty table’s edge. He had never before noticed the uncleanliness of the tabletop, the warp and damage of the wood—the unsightly wood grain ravines, the spalting like veins overcome with decay.



How had he not seen it before? Had he really never noticed? Had he truly never *seen*?



This whole kitchen incubated filth, its every surface permeated with neglect, the unifying quality of its every object. One dead lightbulb remained unchanged after the better part of three years. He knew because he recognized the smoky ghost of the lightbulb’s blown filament; it was the shape of a comic book’s exclamatory starburst speech bubbles, as it had ever been.



His dead mother’s nicked and notched porcelain plates watched over him like blank faces with frowning mouths full of chipped teeth. They looked dumb and hungry. Beno supposed that he could say that about many things.



Beno had a terribly adult thought: Perhaps it was better that his mother was dead.



Had she known—Beno was anguished to even think it—of her husband’s strange proclivities? Had Alvize’s perversion begun in the descrescence of his wife’s final season? Had she known? Had she? Was his mother who he had thought her to be, that model of hygiene whose habits extended even unto spiritual cleanliness; or was she part of the sickness, the grime, the filth; was she in fact the embodiment of imperfections left unnoticed until the present day?



“You’re not eating,” Alvize said to Beno. “What’s the matter? Oatmeal’s no good?”



“Huh?” Beno looked up, only having half-heard what Alvize said.



“I said, is the oatmeal no good?”



Beno shook his head. “No, no, it’s fine. I’m just thinking about a project for school…” Beno regretted breathing here. There was a funk in this place. “I need time to look it over before class.” He checked his watch even though he knew the time.



“You’d better get going, then, eh?” Alvize said.



Beno looked up at his father. A runnel of milk dribbled over Alvize’s lower lip and down his chin. Beno briefly thought the drip might be black. Then the feeble lamp guttered, and then it shone bright, and he saw the milk running out of his father’s mouth was a seemingly uncorrupted white. Seemingly. 



How could Beno ever know?



“Beno,” his father said.



Beno didn’t want to speak anymore, not to his father, perhaps to no one else ever. There was a rage sleeping like a stowaway in the unlit corners of his soul’s deepest hold. He was seized by a violent impulse; it came like a rogue wave, washing him over with fury. He would animally thrash at that goddamn liar of a table, and smash the bastard lamp that pretended to shine. He would—



“Beno,” his father said again.



“Yeah?”



“I’m sorry,” Alvize said, watching himself stir his cereal to no purpose. He managed to look Beno in the eyes before diverting his attention back to his spoon. “You know, about the morning announcements. I went too far.”



“You went too far,” Beno repeated what his father said, not in agreement but to feel the language's shape and sound. Words no longer bore any conceptual meaning. The human tongue, in fact, was an instrument of meaninglessness, a producer of noise and nothing more. The world was not what it was.



“Yes, yes, I did,” Alvize said, setting down his spoon beside his bowl, milk pooling around the spoon’s own small bowl. Beno wondered: after the table was tainted by spillage, was it the milk that would spoil inside of the grain, or was it the milk directly spoiling the grain itself? Where was the ruin and rot’s beginning, and where did it end, if it ever ended at all? “I thought you would think it was funny,” Alvize said, “but now I realize it was childish and hurtful.” He pleached his fingers through his fingers, feigning paternality. “Do you forgive me?”



Beno looked at his watch again, and without looking back up, said, “Sure.”



“Good. Good, good.” Alvize was quiet for a moment, eyes flicking back and forth between the table and his son. “Well, then…well, I guess then have a good day.”



“Have a good day,” Beno said. He then picked up his bag and left for school. Before he left, he saw his father’s loafers set out beside the door, and realized his father’s bare feet were touching the kitchen floor. He decided that rhyme and reason were features of a former life.

Mother Ghoul wondered if Alvize knew his son had seen their misdeeds. 



She hoped the son had the father’s same inclination to amoral squalor. After all, who would feed her after the elder Ablancourt had died? Mother Ghoul believed Alvize had developed a greed for her visions; that he hoped to one day commune alone with the dead. The incentive structure was upturned; there was no pressing need for Alvize to bring her anything but dead flesh. He no longer had, as they said, any skin in the game. And she needed living flesh, much more living flesh.



Ah, there were once such days of unholy glory…



But perhaps the boy would deliver where his old man had come up short. She could search the hidden burrows of the past, but had never once divined the future; precogitation was some other ghoul’s bag. In any event, everything in its time. There is ever a season for all things. Even those things that crawl inside of the dark.



One of the mammoth rats bit her swollen ankle. She smiled nonetheless. Their hunger was only natural.

In 1959/60 my friend Benny and I would go hang out at his fathers apartment in Manhattan. His parents were divorced and his father traveled a lot.  We would take the bus and subway into Manhattan and hang out for a few hours. Later we would go down to the Village and listen to the singers on the streets and coffee houses. 
Later on we would ask cops for the fare home.

I can't be certain, and I wouldn't swear to it, that we saw Dylan then, but we did hear a lot of folkies.

In 1979 I definitely remember seeing Dylan at the No Nukes concert.
Concert.

Two years later I saw him at the Concert For Bangladesh. He closed out the show, and sang lead on the finale. At the time there were reports that Dylan was the person he needed to commit to make it successful. 

There was one other time I saw him that had previously changed folk music forever.

1974 with The Band at Madison Square Garden. That was one of the best concerts that I've been to.

My ex and I had a weekend house in Woodstock and before his motorcycle accident in '79 he would drive through town and someone would scream ""Bob's Coming "" and the town would stop. Even other musicians, maybe more so the other musicians. The store owners, even in midst of a sale would run out.

The catalog of songs, from Blowin' In the Wind to End of the Line got us all thinking and many of us taking action. His song Hurricane helped lead to a falsely convicted man to be released from a life sentence.

*By The Puck’s the Limit, NHL’s Most Charismatic Statistician*

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a matchup so statistically bizarre it could make a spreadsheet weep. The Buffalo Sabres (0-3, 2 goals scored) host the Ottawa Senators (1-2, 8 goals scored), and the only thing more porous than Buffalo’s power play (0-for-11) is the collective sanity of fans who still show up to this. Let’s dissect this clash of hockey’s *“I Forged My Future in a Hammock”* teams with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a penguin on a trampoline.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Statistical Car Crash

**Buffalo Sabres**:

* **Offense**: Scoring two goals in three games is like a toaster trying to bake a soufflé—present, but useless. Their power play? A 0-for-11 slump that’s accrued the drama of a Netflix series where nothing happens.
* **Defense**: Backup goalie Alex Lyon is the lone bright spot, with a .919 save percentage that’s basically a human vault. If Lyon were a coffee filter, the Senators’ shots would still seep through.
* **Injuries**: The Sabres are playing with the roster depth of a children’s book—Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen (IR), Josh Norris (out indefinitely), and a cast of injured supporting characters. Captain Rasmus Dahlin’s postgame quote? “We just can’t catch a break. We got to get out of this bulls\*\*t.” Translation: *“We’re a team, not a cursed reality TV show.”*

**Ottawa Senators**:

* **Offense**: Shane Pinto has scored 4 of their 8 goals, which is like one guy carrying a team while the rest of the squad naps. Their 18% power play success rate is a *“meh”* compared to Buffalo’s 0%.
* **Defense**: Linus Ullmark’s .847 save percentage is worse than a sieve made of Jell-O. If Ullmark were a goalkeeper in a video game, he’d be on “Easy” with the difficulty set to “Embarrassment.”
* **Injuries**: Brady Tkachuk’s absence (at least a month) is a blow, but Ottawa’s “second-worst defense” label is a gift for the Sabres’ broken-offense combo.

**Key Stat**: Buffalo’s home ice advantage? It’s the only reason fans aren’t *literally* wearing paper bags over their heads.

*Where Math Meets Mayhem in the Pacific Northwest*

---

### 1. Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The Mariners (-135) are the chalk here, with a 58.1% implied probability to win, while the Blue Jays (+115) sit at 46.7%. That 11.4% gap feels about right—Seattle’s 53-31 home record this season is as reliable as a coffee addiction on a Monday morning. The Over/Under is 7 runs (-110), but SportsLine’s model craves more drama (8.2 projected combined runs), so take the Over like you take a margarita on a hot day: with reckless optimism.

Key pitching matchups? **George Kirby** (2.70 ERA in 10 playoff innings) vs. **Shane Bieber** (3.57 ERA, but just 2.2 innings in one playoff start). Kirby’s sinker (25–30% of his pitches) has given **George Springer** nightmares (.375 AVG, .693 xSLG vs. it). Meanwhile, Bieber’s post-Tommy John return has been a rollercoaster—think of his ERA as a confused toddler: “I’m 3.57 today, but *maybe* 0.00 tomorrow!”

---

### 2. News Digest: Injuries, Comebacks, and Why Springer is Toronto’s Last Hope

The Blue Jays have scored 4 runs in two games—about as exciting as a group project in a corporate team-building seminar. Their savior? **George Springer**, who’s hit .375 in the playoffs and owns Kirby like a seasoned blackjack player counts cards. Springer’s .305 AVG vs. fastballs? That’s the difference between a “meh” offense and a “hell yes” punch to the Mariners’ gut.

Seattle’s **Cal Raleigh** (.357 playoff AVG) and **Vlad Guerrero Jr.’s** shadow (he’s 0-for-2 in the series so far) add spice. But here’s the kicker: Bieber’s strikeout rate (9.2 K/9) and the Mariners’ playoff-induced whiff festival (25 Ks in 2 games) make him a prime candidate to shatter the Over 4.5 K prop.

---

### 3. Humorous Spin: Because Sports Analysis Needs More Puns

* **George Kirby**: “His ERA is like a Seattle raincloud—ominous, consistent, and likely to dampen your spirits if you’re a Blue Jay.”
* **Shane Bieber**: “He’s coming off Tommy John surgery, which is baseball

Some grew fast, others stalled early. The difference was never equipment or decor. It was how the doctor showed up, both for the team and the community. Here’s what I wish every new orthodontist knew before opening day.

Your presence will always beat your marketing budget. Ads make noise. Presence builds trust. Parents remember the orthodontist who chatted with them at the school fair, not the one who ran a slick Facebook ad. You can’t outsource relationships. Show up at PTA meetings, sponsor local events, walk into pediatric offices with coffee and brochures. Your face, not your logo, is what people commit to.

Before you spend a dime on Google Ads, map your local relationships. Where do parents and families actually gather, online and off? Join local Facebook parenting groups and share quick dental tips. Host Invisalign Scan Nights for moms with free wine and consults. Offer raffle prizes at school events. These aren’t gimmicks; they’re conversations. The cheapest way to market is to actually care where your patients spend time.

Don’t let your schedule clog up with tire-kickers. Use virtual consults to pre-qualify. Have patients send photos or short videos before booking. It saves time, reduces no-shows, and gives families an early yes or no on treatment and costs. Speed matters more than perfection in the early months, momentum keeps morale up.

Your staff drives growth more than your ads ever will. Build a bonus structure early: reward new patient starts, same-day starts, and reduced emergency appointments. A motivated TC can add six figures a year in starts. A disengaged one can kill momentum silently. Pay for performance, not just attendance.

Digital is efficient, but visibility still matters. Mailers work, especially in smaller towns. Billboards, brochures in pediatric offices, even mall kiosks can drive awareness where Google can’t. The goal is omnipresence. When families see your name everywhere, they stop comparing and start trusting.

The first twelve months will test your patience and your ego. You’ll question your decisions weekly. That’s normal. Growth comes from systems, not spikes. Focus on relationships, consistency, and care. Be visible. Be reliable. Be human. That’s what makes practices thrive.

If you’re planning to open soon, ask yourself: where do my future patients spend time, and am I there? What’s my plan to keep my team aligned and rewarded? How am I tracking actual relationships, not just clicks? Can I sustain this effort for a year before expecting real returns? Opening a practice isn’t just a business move, it's a community investment. Build roots first. The revenue follows.",1,1760546241.0,GrowOrtho,0,1.0,False
1o7fztw,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1o7fztw/some_gerd_questions_help_identifying_triggers/,Some GERD questions. Help identifying triggers.,"Long post. Thanks in advance if you read it.

I've had GERD since 2019. 20mg of Omeprazole every other day kept it under control and I could eat whatever I wanted. Beer, burgers, spicy food, pizza. I'd only have heartburn if I forgot to take omeprazole. I had an endoscopy in 2023 that found 2 cm sliding hiatal hernia. 

In 2025 everything changed. 

July 11: I started experiencing constant pressure in my chest and nothing I took helped. I went to the ER and to rule out anything cardiac.

July 23: I went to my GI and he bumped me up to 40mg Omeprazole daily. He ordered an ultrasound, ct scan, and endoscopy. He also wanted me to see my cardiologist to check out my heart palpatations. 

August - September: I was now taking 40mg Omeprazole a day and I loosely followed the acid watcher diet and cut out all the common culprits. I sleep on a wedge pillow and don't eat for 4 hours before I go to bed. 

For about a month I had little to no appetite. I was eating less food per meal than my 8 year old son for a while and lost about 20 lbs. Eventually my appetite came back thankfully, but I have no idea what caused this. 

September 16: I was starting to feel a little better, but the pressure in my chest was still a daily occurrence. I was feeling really bloated so I cut down to 20mg Omeprazole daily to see if that helped. 

September 23: Finally had my endoscopy. After the procedure the doctor told me that my esophagus and stomach looked normal and that the discomfort that I was feeling was probably due to my hernia and not reflux. 

I was too optimistic about the endoscopy and I began to test cheat food on the weekends. I never felt better, but nothing ever made me feel worse. I was able to have a cup of coffee or a slice of pizza and felt the same.

October 10: Follow-up appointment with GI to go over endoscopy. He told me that they took biopsies of my distal esophagus and parts of my stomach and they showed I have microscopic inflammation that is acid related. I was feeling fine going into the appointment and IMMEDIATELY felt the pressure in my chest increase when I heard this. My heart sank because I thought I was making progress.

October 11: I stupidly ate like crap the following day despite the bad news. I had spicy food and fast food. 

October 13: The symptoms got noticeably worse today. The pressure was now mixed with a stabbing/burning feeling. The only thing out of the ordinary that I ate today was blueberries with morning oatmeal. Usually I have banana. 

Today: Overnight I was woken up by chest discomfort. This is only the second time that this has happened in months. I started back on 40mg Omeprazole to hopefully bring the symptoms back under control. 

Questions: 

1. How soon after eating a trigger food do you feel symptoms getting worse? For example, I got worse this past Monday. I had fast food and a beer this past Saturday. I had blueberries Monday morning. Could the fast food have caused the trigger 2 days later or is it more likely due to eating the blueberries Monday morning?

2. Triggers lead to symptoms suddenly getting worse which I'm assuming is a flareup. The usual medicine doesn't seem to be helping for me. How long does this usually last for people? 

3. I haven't felt normal in months, but some days are better  and some days are worse. Why is this if my diet remains relatively the same day to day? 

4. Gut brain connection is real. It's crazy how much worse I immediately felt after my GI doctor told me that I had inflammation due to reflux after all. Is there a way to mentally get over this? 

5. My main symptom is pressure in the middle of my chest. I usually have to burp after eating or drinking anything including water, and I can usually make myself burp by massaging this area. What exactly am I feeling? Is it gas in the stomach? Acid refluxing up the esophagus? Inflammation? It's not really painful just uncomfortable. I do also get heartburn, but it's a different feeling.

Now, I've been to LA 4 times, maybe 5, traveling from KY. I have grown fond of staying at the Hilton Inn Arcadia/Pasadena, swear to god I know the area like I grew up there now but I think a change of pace would be nice. Just because I know the area and am comfortable with it doesn't mean I should stay there every single time.

For reference:

28 and 25 y/o partner will join, she wants to do DTF so I'll oblige and we'll do that on a Sunday, I just wanna show her the observatory, SM pier/beach, neighborhood visits, sight see, we'll cruise to Calabasas and other areas of Southern California. I just adore being in that part of the world, the only thing I really am looking forward to is getting San Fernando Coffee again lmao that was banging last time

It's her first time, really just wanna show her the place and have her enjoy it as much as I do.

Nothing that we really ""must"" do, just really looking for a place to stay, doesn't have to be fancy at all. I fucked with the Checkers Hotel in DTLA but it was pretty pricey for our stay.

We both have GOVX and ""Freehand"" ""CitizenM"" and ""The Line"" are wildly cheap for our 3 day stay ($225 total) but Freehand and CitizenM seem super close to Skid Row per maps.

Hilton Inn Arcadia/Pasadena was like $300 for our 3 day stay.

We have a rental car and already have a SpotHero picked out with In/Out privileges.

Just wanna stay somewhere new, I love Pasadena and Arcadia area and I'll take her out there to explore but I think I'd like to stay somewhere cooler this time around, somewhere with more happening.

Thoughts? Hotel or AirBnB?

Biltmore is like $337 total for 3 nights

Double Tree in Buena Park is like $275 total.

The Line is $280 total but I hate the concrete wall look, that's abysmal.

Godfrey Hotel is like $375 total.

Sheraton Gateway LA is like $315 total.

Double Tree LA - Commerce is like $300 total.

Doulbe Tree LA - Norwalk is like $300 total.

Hilton Checkers is like $335 total.

Ive been in a relationship for around 7-8 years now, I live with my partner & 2 kids (stepdaughter & daughter) I currently work part time as does my partner, I was working full time but since my daughter's birth I wanted to spend more time with her incase anything happened as she has a heart condition anything could happen at anytime, I've never been successful in work & always had low paying jobs, I kind of accept I've failed in that aspect of life now although I'm very capable my confidence has always been something thats held me back in life, I never feel like I'm going to have success in work at this stage of my life so I was kind of happy to sacrifice work hours to spend more time with my daughter. I am abit of a recluse & stay indoors most the time unless I'm taking my daughter out, at work or walking the dog. We don't really have the finances to go crazy places all the time but I'll regularly take her out on walks or just to the shop or to walk the dog & she loves it. My partner never really takes her out anywhere, most the time when she goes out she wants to leave our daughter here which I don't mind but my daughter wants to go out places. It's rare she plays with her, she's always so engrossed into her phone or a game she's playing, she deprives herself of sleep for games or social media which sometimes effects her mood the following day. When we argue she gets very defensive and denies things that she knows are factual, she will become verbally aggressive very fast, Im very calm 99% of the time although I will call her names sometimes and as soon as I do I'll get called abusive and she will act like a victim even if she's called me 20 names before I called her one. She spends a lot of time in bed just on her phone or playing games, watching tv, she doesn't often help around the house with chores. I find myself pottering round all day tidying up after everyone, I don't mind tidying up but the way she lives is like she's one of the children. She Lies in her room leaving cups and plates and dirty clothes everywhere. Wrappers all on the floor and half drank coffees lying around for days until I mention them most the time, I try not to mention it as often as I want too cause when I do it somehow gets turned onto me and how I've done this & that, most the time i tend to just get on with it on my own or she will just quickly rush s chore in the morning so she can then justify sitting upstairs all day. she denies all of this and says she does loads around the house and she always bothers with the kids, then sometimes the following day she will say im right then for a week or so following the arguments she will tidy up way more & play with our daughter more and then it will all rapidly fade away again & she will revert back to leaving rubbish and mugs and clothes everywhere lying around, her daughter is also very messy and her mom often disciplines her by taking away her phone or stopping her going somewhere because of her uncleanliness, but I always say they are as bad as eachother and our child isn't going to grow up and be tidy whilst watching her mom live the same way. This routine of us arguing about it and then her changing for a week or so has been a regular occurrence over the whole relationship, I genuinely love her but I hate the way she is, we generally have a healthy relationship and this has been the main issue over the last couple of years. It may sound like I'm exaggerating and maybe I am, that's how I'm made to feel but overtime it really wears me down, 9 times out of 10 when she does any sort of housework it's because I've started doing it and she will try and take over which she's said herself it's because I moan she doesn't do anything. Then it makes me feel bad but do I moan too much? Or is it justified. I don't know but I feel like it is all driving me insane over time.

I shrugged it off maybe I was stressed or had too much coffee. Then it happened again, different meal but same story. A few times it would flare just around my nose little red bumps, irritation. At first I thought it was skincare but the timing always matched meals that had something extra a spice mix, bean, oil. So I started paying attention and taking notes of what I ate and how i felt afterwards, desperately looking for a way out, but my gut and skin are telling me something I ignored too long.

I ran into my room to put clothes on, and they were GIGGLING about how I told them not to come in and they did anyway.

**Why This Pick?**

The Flames have lost all 3 of their last encounters with Utah by at least 2 goals. The Mammoth also have a number of advantages in today’s meeting – including (but certainly not limited to…) the fact that they’re at home and Calgary will be playing on a back to back. Having not scored more than 2 goals per game in their last 3 straight outings (and losing those same 3 by at least 2…), I think it’d be tough for the Flames to snag a win here. My money’s on the Mammoth to cover the PL.

1o7fptf,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenV/comments/1o7fptf/thoughts_on_e7/,Thoughts on E7,"Basically, I thought all the B plots and small moments were extremely well done, and the A plot was incredibly poorly done.

I thought the Polarity vs Cipher Magneto vs Prof X thing was awesome.

I thought the love triangle scene at the coffee shop was shockingly well done. I did not care at ALL about Greg before this episode and thought the 3 of them nailed that scene.

I thought the Annabeth revealing her first vision (and Marie's response) was great. It was kind of predictable, but well done.

I thought Jordan and Annabeth in the car was great.

I thought Marie refusing to heal Cate made sense even though Cate and Polarity were right, and I thought that scene was great.

I thought the imagery of Marie going a little off the deep end and picking up her friends was a cool moment. 

I also thought the acting, overall, was great, which I dont always think lol.

But the actual plot of Marie going so far off the deep end that she ignores all her friends and her sister's vision and doesnt even take a second to think about the implications of what shes doing, combined with the fact that NONE of them suspected for even a millisecond that it wasn't a good idea to heal the Guy in the Tube They Know Almost Nothing About and hope he can take down the guy who can POSSESS PEOPLE but doesn't have V in his system??

Genuinely I thought the fact that there wasn't a character even suspecting this was amongst the worst writing choice that the Boys universe has ever made, which is saying something. I can't understand for a second why they didnt even consider that Godolkin might not be a super helpful guy and that Cipher might not be what he seems to be.",8,1760545587.0,GenV,8,0.91,False

1o7fm77,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1o7fm77/explore_best_appliance_slider_mats_cooks/,Explore Best Appliance Slider Mats Cooks Innovations Review Worth It,"Testing out the Cooks Innovations V1903B heat-resistant mats has been quite an interesting experience. I've been getting into appliances for everything from brewing fresh coffee to slow cooking delicious stews, and my countertops were starting to show the wear and tear of constant use. After coming across these mats, I decided to give them a whirl, hoping they’d live up to their ratings and advanced features. Spoiler alert: it’s been a mostly smooth ride, with just a few hiccups here and there.

**User-Friendly Design and Versatility**  
The first thing I noticed about these protective mats is the clever design. Each pack includes three different sizes: 8x8 inches, 10x12 inches, and 12x14 inches. This range is a game-changer, allowing me to use the mats with practically any appliance I own. Whether it's my drip coffee maker in the morning or my bread machine on busy weekends, everything fits perfectly. They're thin yet durable, and they fit snugly under my coffee maker without adding unnecessary bulk.

[Check Cooks Innovations V1903B price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0cc7g729p/)

**Heat and Scratch Resistance**  
One of my biggest frustrations has always been heat marks and scratches on my countertop. I tried using regular placemats, but they were either not durable enough or downright ugly to look at. These mats, on the other hand, genuinely deliver on their promise. I’ve placed everything from boiling-hot pots to sizzling air fryer plates on these mats without the slightest incident. The material is sturdy yet lightweight and offers excellent protection against scuffs or heat damage. No more worrying about accidentally dragging my coffee machine or slow cooker and leaving marks behind.

**Efficiency Meets Functionality**  
The sliding function is what makes these mats stand out. Honestly, I never realized how much I needed something to move my kitchen appliances around without lifting them. The mats slide like butter on the counter, taking away all the hassle of repositioning heavier appliances like the air fryer or stand mixer. Especially on busy mornings, being able to tug my coffee maker closer for a quick brew feels like such a luxury. No grating sounds, no heavy lifting—just smooth gliding.

**Good Aspects**  
Several positives deserve special mention:  
- The variety of sizes accommodates both small and bulky appliances.  
- Lightweight yet sturdy; they don’t feel like cheap thin pads.  
- The mats are machine washable and easy to clean, cutting down on maintenance.  
- Durable heat resistance makes them multitask as trivets for hot pots and pans.  
- Their sleek black design blends effortlessly with my modern kitchen decor.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Of course, not everything is flawless:  
- Over time, I noticed that the sliding action becomes less smooth on one mat due to wear and tear.  
- The design might not suit those who prefer colored mats to match their counter aesthetics.  
- Some users mentioned issues with particularly rough countertops where sliding isn’t as seamless.  
- Cutting the mats down to size (if needed) is possible, but not as straightforward as stated.  

**Product Rivals**  
While the Cooks Innovations mats are impressively functional, they do face stiff competition. I’ve tried similar products from other brands, like appliance coasters and silicone pads. Compared to these, the heat resistance of this product is unmatched, especially for frequent coffee maker and air fryer users. However, silicone mats from some brands do feel more premium when it comes to texture and flexibility. Sliding function is Cooks Innovations’ trump card—it truly sets these apart from products that just sit idly on the counter with limited functionality.

**True Value**  
Considering the features packed into this product, it’s quite a steal. The added protection for your countertops, reduced effort in sliding appliances, and the versatility in sizes make it an excellent investment. I’ve spent more on single-purpose trivets and mats that don’t even come close to this level of efficiency. If your countertops and appliances endure heavy use, this product is worth exploring.

1o7flsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4rToronto_Clean/comments/1o7flsa/38m4f_downtown_toronto_looking_to_date/,38M4F - Downtown Toronto - Looking to date intentionally,"Hello! I've been single for a couple of years after being in relationships since I was 29. I find online dating to be frustrating currently, because they give you so little space to really describe yourself! A handful of pictures, maybe a few short blurbs about your hobbies (or a few sentences), and that's it. So, after stumbling on this subreddit, I thought I'd give something different a shot.

I'm white, 38, 5'11 and 175lbs with brown hair and a beard. I wear glasses and I'm practically blind without them. I live and work downtown. My current job involves a bit of travel, but nothing excessive, and overall I now have an amazing work-life balance with low stress. 

I've got a variety of hobbies. I'm a fan of soccer, in particular EPL, and try to watch at least one game a week (time permitting). I love to travel, but I'm not really an all-inclusive / beach person. I much prefer actively visiting historical sites, museums, food tours, nature preserves, etc. I'm fond of camping and hiking, in either the early spring or late summer/fall (the bugs eat me alive if I go anywhere in Ontario in the summer). I'm a fan of the arts, in particular live theatre (Fringe festival is my favourite time of year in Toronto), live music (mostly metal and classical), and live comedy (improv more than standup). I enjoy going to the ROM and AGO, and smaller museums. I'm a foodie and I'm always down to try new restaurants (Japanese, Korean, and Chinese are my favourites).

For quieter hobbies, I'm into tabletop and board games, and video games. I follow a number of different podcasts, like OSPod, Sounds like a Cult, and Moviestruck. I'm a voracious reader; mostly science fiction, fantasy, and history, although I will dabble in other genres when something appeals to me. I will watch a variety of TV shows, although I'm not really a fan of reality TV. Movies I'm down for pretty much anything, although my favourites by far are Horror and Action (especially older martial arts films).

My friends would describe me as thoughtful, caring, considerate, and contemplative. I'm quiet, but not because I'm shy, rather because I prefer to listen. I think things through before I respond. But on the right topic I will absolutely talk your ear off.

If you've made it this far, you're wondering what am I looking for? A long term partner, but not keen to rush things. I'd rather spend quality time together through our shared hobbies and interests, and learning about what you enjoy in the hobbies and interests we don't share! We can chat for a bit on here, and then grab a coffee or tea in person and see where things go. ",3,1760545334.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

My father abandoned me and my mom after pushing her down the stairs didn’t lead to my d****. Three younger siblings (who I raised) and a revolving door of shi**y guys lead my mom to meet step dad. Who has been emotionally, mentally and physically a***ive to me since I was 8. From puberty on I’ve been overly sexualized by guys. At 15 I was a**aulted by a close guy friend. my OB said no kids (something I’ve always wanted). 17 I moved out and went no contact with my family after being financially ab**ed by my mother. We moved around a lot to hide the abuse so I had no one. My extended family didn’t know of the abuse until I started sharing more in adulthood. Since then I’ve had therapy and reconnected with my siblings but not “parents”. I’ve always been independent in all ways and relied on my own resources to support myself. In college I dated but nothing serious. I was again a**aulted but this time by a partner. 

At 23 I lost my grandpa to a stroke, (the only man who never hurt me in my life). With his death I was open to reconciliation with my family with distance. I ended up shouldering the burden of grief for my entire family. 

At 23 was told (again) no kids and that I would have to have some further tests. COVID left me homeless. I got a live in nanny job until ai was displaced through the George Floyd protests. I got housing and then I went through four procedures and recovery alone that lead to a cervical cancer diagnosis. A procedure at 25 to remove the cancer again faced alone. I stared making friends but have always felt disconnected from them because of my trauma. Same in dating. I’ve had boyfriends but never really been in love with them. 90% of them were bad guys and the 10% that weren’t ended up falling in love and starting a family with the next person they dated ( cab light theory). 

2022-2024 I chose to be single and work on myself, get back into college, and get my mind and life together. Getting on the apps late 2024 I set my goals on being intentional and honest with myself and what I want from a partner but I wasn’t holding my breath. He was the third person I matched with.

Story:


I (28f) and T (43 M) matched on Bumble. After matching late 2024 and four months of talking long distance (he travels all over the country for work) he flew me out to spend a week with him. I had some feelings for him before we connected in person but was guarded and a little pessimistic if I’m being honest as he is just a MAN FROM THE INTERNET and I’m not in the business of being made a fool. 

When we were communicating initially, it was voice memos, FaceTime and call but not overbearing. Not Goodmorning type messages but things about his life, his family, what he was excited to do that day and what he couldn’t wait to show me. He went on a trip with his family and made a point to send pictures of things that reminded him of me and to FaceTime every night despite the time difference. Things I didn’t ask for or imply that I wanted/ needed. He just did the things a girl would ask of a partner to feel secure when a relationship is long distance. Though we were on different sides of the country for Christmas and the New Year he still made the holidays special.  He even bought me a gift! T encouraged my art, my music, and said he was proud of my heart for caring so much about the people around me. We bonded over books, travel, Weird Al, O even made a special trip to somewhere he’s always wanted to go to bring him a silly souvenir that I planned to give him when we met. He followed up with me about my family and life- remembering even the smallest things. 

On a whim I took some time off from work and told him I was going to book a flight to wherever he was. He said he was actually planning a trip for me already and that my flight was booked. From the second he picked me up at the airport to the time we hugged goodbye being together created these feelings I have yet to experience with anyone else. He rented a car and we drove up the coast together. 27 dates in 5 days but I would be happy just walking next to him, and I was. Even just sitting in the car listening to audiobooks I was happy to just be with him. It rained nearly the whole time I was there but in my heart it was sunny and warm. I did not ask him to pay for things or plan anything, I was just happy to have the time with him. I took my alone time in the mornings and brought him coffee when  he woke up. We danced in parking lots, kissed in the rain, walked hand in hand on the beach, all the things he planned I never felt so seen. He always made me feel secure and safe and I trust him with my everything, even now. 

When we said goodbye at the airport, he hugged me and kissed me told me to have safe travels and that he would talk to me after I landed. While I was sitting in the airport waiting for my flight, he had said he might need a little bit of time to digest our time together as it was “all consuming”.  I granted him the time and didn’t text him until he texted me, which was every single day for a week telling me about the things that he was seeing that reminded him of me. When he did laundry from our trip together, he literally said he couldn’t stop smiling because he could remember what we did on the days he wore certain things (all of this unprompted and he reached out first). Then about a week later, he said that he couldn’t talk to me anymore, and that our intentions weren’t in alignment and he needed some time for himself. I told him I could give him some space, but I still care deeply for him. After about two weeks of low contact, I called to check in and it ended up with us breaking up?  We were never an established relationship, but we spoke every single day and as he travels for work, I was more than happy to be someone to listen to his travels and keep company over the phone. We FaceTime and he looked like he had been going through something and I told him that I was OK no longer romantically pursuing him….I lied. 

Throughout all of this experience, I have not tried to put any pressure on him for a relationship. I only told him that I love him once, but I did not force him to accept those feelings. I just wanted to tell him that he was worth fighting for and then I’ve never wanted to wait for someone as much as I wanted to with him. I told him I could wait. I told him that we could continue on in the same space that we were continuing, but he said that it would hurt too much. Distance seemed to play a role in the breakdown, he used distance as a cop out as I expressed from day 2 of talking I’m not interested in getting to know some across the country if they aren’t willing to put in the work. When getting down to the bottom of it it seemed we broke up due to where he was at mentally and emotionally. Though he communicated that we cannot continue to pursue things romantically right now he wanted me to continue to maintain contact with him. Keep him updated on the things that were going on in my life whether it be happy or sad. He maintained that he was always going to be in my corner and I can rely on him no matter what. Not once did he use the word or phrase “as friends”. 

Since March We’ve sent voice memos and texts me wishing him a happy, obscure holiday and him sending regards back. I sent him a late birthday text and he sent me one on my birthday saying he would reach out soon to wish my dog a happy birthday. It’s been about seven months and I still think about him every single day. I still wanna talk to him from the second I wake up to the second I fall asleep at night. Everything about him is everything that I’ve ever wanted in a partner there were no red flags or even beige flags to show me that he may have been speaking to someone else. 

Recently,
My aunt took her own life, a friend passed away in an accident, and I lost another family member not long after. These losses put things into perspective for me and all I wanted to do was tell everyone that I care about how much they mean to me, including him. I may have cancer for a second time and with whatever time I have I want to be brave and honest and love without reserve.


Two weeks ago, (before the possible diagnosis but after deaths) I sent him a voice message that I still cared very deeply for him, but that I can no longer continue to keep reaching out because it hurts too much. I told him that I released him from my heart and that while I still want nothing but happiness for him in his life I know that’s not with me and that if I continue to rely on him as someone that I can talk to my heart won’t be able to let go… the same thing I’ve been telling myself every day since we stopped romantically talking in March of this year. 

He saved my voice memo, but never responded.

Now to the advice, I have the opportunity to spend some time in his state in about two months. I’ll be alone while I’m there and I feel that though he’ll probably reject the idea. I would like to meet him one last time and return a gift he had given me. I want to thank him in person for all of the things that he’s done for me in my life and for the feelings that I felt into express how grateful I am to have had him as part of my life and my heart. I know fully it will not bloom into a second chance but I can’t imagine throwing away the gift and holding onto it feels like I am holding onto him.

Should I reach out to him?

Even using fresh beans could just not get it consistent. Thus I’m now between something like the Delonghi Magnifica Start or the Ninja Luxe Cafe Pro. 

Ninja Luxe Pros: seems with the 701 they’ve refined the barista assist so could make it easier to have a more traditional espresso experience 

Delonghi pros: seems easy once you get the settings right for more bean to cup. It’s also way cheaper so trying to see if the extra money for ninja is worth it 

Any input is appreciated. I want to stay under $600 but could eventually save for the ninja if it’s really worth it ",2,1760545152.0,superautomatic,2,1.0,False
