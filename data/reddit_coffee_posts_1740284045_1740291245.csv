I‚Äôm a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can‚Äôt help but feel empty I guess. Let‚Äôs fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I‚Äôm a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can‚Äôt sing.

I‚Äôm love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Want to come over for a drink? Not really, an online drink I suppose. Maybe we can talk about the above stuff. Some things I didn‚Äôt mention. Let me know you and you know me and we‚Äôll see where it goes.

I think we could be great friends if we give it a go.",1,1740291068.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False
1iw3ld2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iw3ld2/i_need_help_with_staying_or_leaving_my_first_job/,I need help with staying or leaving my first job,"Okay so I applied to many jobs for my first job and Dunkin was the first to apply back and give me my first job offer. And I took it like I‚Äôm working in training rn! But I FEEL SO STRESSED OUT ABT IT. I told my family abt it but they all say that once I get used to it I‚Äôll get comfortable with working on the pos, making drinks, sandwiches station, cleaning, and other things. Idk how to explain it but working their FOR JUST 4 HOURS WITH DREADFUL. I have made one coworker friend there but she leaves before I clock out. AND OMG WHY ARE GUYS SO HARD TO TALK TO like I was trying to make conversation so it‚Äôs not awkward but he was so awkward and dry.I wanted to cry üôÉ.but yeah they said I‚Äôm being dramatic abt it and to stuck it up because everyone has to deal with it to. AND THE memorizing the drinks like the cappuccino, latte, macchiato their the same but different. AND ALSO THE SANDWICHE STATION IM GOING TO LOSE MY MIND. My heart goes out to those who work a fast food .I did apply to other jobs that not fast food like grocery stores and retail because I don‚Äôt think I can do it anymore and I‚Äôm only 3 days in. Hopefully I do get the grocery store job so I can leave. AND ALSO THEY HAVE THIS LIKE  competition between other Dunkin stores where they see who can get the drinks faster to the customer like the moment u leave the drive thru to pull up 2nd window the drink has to be ready. Which is crazy because why would you rush someone coffee and mess up  just so that the store can we a pizza party and be top 3. Idk if you guys know that or if that for all locations or not but it‚Äôs for mine. But yeah sorry for the rambling üòä PLEASE DO TELL ME IF YOU GUYS WOULD LEAVE TOO FOR A BETTER JOB THAT NOT MAKING DRINKS! To make me feel less bad abt it ",1,1740291059.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I prefer the Victorian romance aesthetic.","It can be an already existing perfume or individual notes that resemble this. I could actually create my own perfume at a fragrance factory but I‚Äôd have to know the exact notes. I‚Äôm looking for an ethereal, otherworldly scent. I don‚Äôt like Chanel, old lady scents. I like historical scents, if that makes sense? Something that represents a particular time period. I tend to go for gourmands (chocolate, coffee, guava, bergamot, citrus, vanilla, milk and almond based). I don‚Äôt like mass appealing conventional ‚ÄúMiss Dior‚Äù type of powdery fragrances. I want to confuse others with this scent lol, but I also want to fall in love with an eternal melancholic romantic aroma.

1iw3jik,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1iw3jik/why_are_people_so_obsessed_with_coke_the_drink/,Why are people so obsessed with Coke (the drink)?,"Just curious. I‚Äôve been going out with a few women that I met online and I‚Äôve had a number of them say they don‚Äôt drink water, they only drink Coke and maybe a few other energy drinks (coffee, Rockstars, etc.). None of them drink water and just have caffeine drinks running through their system. They‚Äôll all say the same things like, ‚Äúwater is gross‚Äù and ‚Äúcaffeine makes me sleepy‚Äù. I‚Äôve also had a few family members and friends who had this weird addiction to it too. It just seems like an awful and unhealthy habit and it decreases my attraction to the people I‚Äôm going out with personally because when I think of having a kid, if she‚Äôs just drinking Coke all day and has no water at all, I‚Äôd imagine that can‚Äôt be healthy for the baby or her health.

So what‚Äôs with this weird Coke obsession that some people have? I‚Äôve never run into a Coke drinker that just drinks it occasionally. They all have a dependency on it and it‚Äôs weird. I know lots of people that drink Sprite, root beer, etc. and they‚Äôll just drink it at parties or while they‚Äôre out to eat but Coke drinkers will have it right when they wake up, during breakfast, during lunch, during dinner, as a midnight refresher. They basically use it as a replacement for water. Even coffee drinkers often stop at 2pm and will drink water. It‚Äôs odd. ",1,1740290856.0,NoStupidQuestions,3,1.0,False

* **Lack of a Dedicated Play Area**: While spacious, there's no specific off-leash area or playground equipment for dogs .
* **Encounter with Wildlife**: Be cautious of water monitor lizards which may pose a hazard .
* **Sun Exposure**: Minimal shade in some areas means it could get quite hot. It‚Äôs advisable to visit during cooler parts of the day .

=======================================================================

When you‚Äôre on the road, whether for business or pleasure, finding a decent hotel near you can make all the difference. It‚Äôs not just about having a place to crash‚Äîit‚Äôs about finding a spot that offers comfort, convenience, and value for your hard-earned money. But let‚Äôs face it, with so many options out there, it can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. How do you know which hotels are truly decent? What should you look for to ensure you‚Äôre getting the best bang for your buck?

In this guide, we‚Äôll walk you through everything you need to know about finding decent hotels near you. From understanding what makes a hotel ‚Äúdecent‚Äù to tips for scoring the best deals, we‚Äôve got you covered. So, grab a cup of coffee, sit back, and let‚Äôs dive in!

What Makes a Hotel ‚ÄúDecent‚Äù?
----------------------------

Before we start hunting for decent hotels near me, it‚Äôs important to define what ‚Äúdecent‚Äù actually means. After all, one person‚Äôs idea of a decent hotel might be another‚Äôs nightmare. Generally speaking, a decent hotel strikes a balance between comfort, cleanliness, amenities, and affordability.

Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of what to look for:

- **Cleanliness**: A clean room and bathroom are non-negotiable.
- **Comfort**: A good bed, quiet environment, and climate control are essential.
- **Amenities**: Free Wi-Fi, breakfast, and parking can add significant value.
- **Location**: Proximity to attractions, restaurants, and public transport is a huge plus.
- **Customer Service**: Friendly and helpful staff can make your stay much more enjoyable.

Now that we‚Äôve got the basics down, let‚Äôs explore how to find these gems.

How to Find Decent Hotels Near Me
---------------------------------

Finding decent hotels near you doesn‚Äôt have to be a daunting task. With the right tools and strategies, you can narrow down your options and find the perfect place to stay. Here‚Äôs how:

### 1. Use Online Travel Agencies (OTAs)

Websites like Booking.com, Expedia, and Hotels.com are goldmines for finding decent hotels. They allow you to filter results based on your preferences, read reviews, and compare prices. Plus, many OTAs offer exclusive deals and discounts.

### 2. Read Reviews Carefully

Reviews can be a treasure trove of information, but take them with a grain of salt. Look for patterns‚Äîif multiple people mention cleanliness issues, it‚Äôs probably a red flag. On the flip side, consistent praise for friendly staff or great location is a good sign.

### 3. Check Out Hotel Websites

Sometimes, booking directly through a hotel‚Äôs website can score you better rates or perks like free upgrades. It‚Äôs always worth a look!

### 4. Consider Alternative Accommodations

Don‚Äôt limit yourself to traditional hotels. Platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo offer unique stays that might be just as decent‚Äîor even better‚Äîthan a standard hotel.

### 5. Use Maps to Check Location

A hotel might look great on paper, but if it‚Äôs in the middle of nowhere, it might not be worth it. Use Google Maps to check its proximity to the places you want to visit.

Top Features to Look for in Decent Hotels
-----------------------------------------

When searching for decent hotels near me, keep an eye out for these features that can elevate your stay:

### 1. Free Breakfast

Who doesn‚Äôt love starting the day with a hearty meal? Hotels that offer complimentary breakfast can save you time and money.

### 2. Free Wi-Fi

In today‚Äôs connected world, free Wi-Fi is a must. Whether you‚Äôre working or just scrolling through social media, you‚Äôll want a reliable connection.

### 3. On-Site Parking

If you‚Äôre driving, free or affordable parking can be a game-changer.

### 4. Fitness Center

For fitness enthusiasts, a well-equipped gym can make all the difference.

### 5. Pet-Friendly Policies

Traveling with your furry friend? Look for hotels that welcome pets.

Budget-Friendly Decent Hotels Near Me
-------------------------------------

Finding a decent hotel that fits your budget is entirely possible. Here are some tips to help you save:

### 1. Book in Advance

The early bird catches the worm‚Äîor in this case, the best deals. Booking ahead of time can save you a bundle.

### 2. Travel During Off-Peak Seasons

Rates are often lower during off-peak times. Plus, you‚Äôll avoid the crowds!

### 3. Look for Package Deals

Bundling your hotel stay with flights or car rentals can lead to significant savings.

### 4. Use Loyalty Programs

If you frequently stay at a particular hotel chain, signing up for their loyalty program can earn you discounts and perks.

### 5. Negotiate

Don‚Äôt be afraid to call the hotel directly and ask for a better rate. You might be surprised at what they‚Äôre willing to offer!

Decent Hotels Near Me: Hidden Gems You Shouldn‚Äôt Miss
-----------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, the best hotels are the ones that fly under the radar. Here are a few hidden gems that consistently deliver a decent experience:

### 1. Boutique Hotels

These smaller, often independently-owned hotels offer unique charm and personalized service.

### 2. Bed and Breakfasts

For a cozy, homey vibe, consider a B&amp;B. Many offer delicious homemade breakfasts and a warm atmosphere.

### 3. Extended Stay Hotels

If you‚Äôre planning a longer trip, these hotels often come with kitchenettes and other home-like amenities.

### 4. Eco-Friendly Hotels

For the environmentally conscious traveler, eco-friendly hotels offer sustainable practices without sacrificing comfort.

Questions to Ask Before Booking a Decent Hotel
----------------------------------------------

Before you hit that ‚Äúbook now‚Äù button, here are a few questions to consider:

- Is the hotel in a safe area?
- What‚Äôs the cancellation policy?
- Are there any hidden fees?
- Does the hotel offer shuttle services?
- What‚Äôs the check-in/check-out time?

Taking the time to ask these questions can save you from unpleasant surprises later.

Final Thoughts on Finding Decent Hotels Near Me

Finding a decent hotel near you doesn‚Äôt have to be a stressful experience. By knowing what to look for, using the right tools, and keeping an open mind, you can find a place that meets your needs and exceeds your expectations.

1iw3fxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1iw3fxi/day_28_off_the_sauce/,Day 28 off the sauce,"I'm pretty much just posting this for myself and the notes i've taken about how i feel after quitting. If someone/anyone can find value in this ill count it as a win. For context I got tricked as a highschooler into vaping and then realized vaping was probably the lamest vice possible and switched to zyn through college. So in total I've been on nicotine for around 8 years and zyn for 5.

Day 1: Put the puck down pretty much at a random time, nothing really spurred it beyond the nagging thought of, ""I need to get of this shit"". I'm sure everyone motivates themselves differently but a few of the thoughts that helped me may be a bit unconventional. First was, ""I will not lose to this little fucking packet of salt."" Second was, ""Phillip Morris is evil and I won't let them take any more of my money."" (Like thousands a year, an absolutely disgusting figure).

Days 2-4: The heat of the physical withdrawals: ""This feeling is just that poison leaving your body."" I kept telling myself I was 'over the hill' after about 6 hours and just kept repeating that until all the physical withdrawal symptoms went away. Once you actually are past them just remind yourself not to have to go through that again.

Day 5: I'm a little bit different than some people in this sub, I am a guy in my 20s and I still want to be able to enjoy some beers with my buddies so it was important I could prove to myself I could drink and not use zyn even though all of them do too. So i got piss drunk watching sports and had my sole focus on not using any. BANG MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. It may not apply to most but for me, 22M, all my friends use it so I know I'm gonna be around it so I have to be able to tell myself no even when I'm vulnerable. Hangovers also feel more mellow btw

  
1 week mark: Your motivation to do stuff shoots up pretty much after those initial days. I also noticed my palms were not clamy like they sometimes were and my hands which naturally shake a bit were practically still. I used to also get some pretty gnarly acid reflux and that is gone too. I then decided I should start working out again and ran a mile and it seemed 100x easier than at any point in the 5 years I was using zyn no matter how good of shape I was in at that point, was a minute better than my best time using zyn and I haven't ran in a few months. Something to do with blood circulation.

2 week: Brain fog was at its peak. I am studying for my CPA and wanted to prove to myself I did not need it for something I would normally crutch on it for. Instead, like many others, I have turned to seltzer water and mentos gum. Taking my exam this week, will update if anyone cares. Also kind of graphic but you may have trouble dropping a deuce for a few days, if that is the case i'd crush some coffee and try your hardest, it'll be gone by week 3-4.

Week 3: Appetite has shot up. Beware of what you eat I gained like 5 pounds because I didn't realize I was snacking so much. Try to get some healthier stuff in the house. Right now I drink a gallon of water a day which solves most of it because most hunger spikes is just dehydration anyways. I've been crushing chomps meat sticks, beef jerky, carrots, any kind of berries, frozen grapes and pickles.

Week 4: My sleep schedule has worked back to normal. I've had crazy dreams and have much deeper sleep. My mouth also feels generally cleaner, I'm not sure the science behind this or if it is in my head but I've managed to convince myself there is a difference which I don't mind because it is just one more reason to stay the course. 

I'm no where near being where I want to be, so unsolicited advice is welcome and if I screwed something up just let me know so I'm not giving crap info to people trying to better themselves. Much love and you got this,

1iw3e5n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iw3e5n,What I‚Äôm getting rid of & why pt. 2 ‚ú®üßöüèæ (mom wanted some new samples after seeing what the neighbors got ü§£),"So, I was on the phone with my mom and she asked me about my day. I gave her the run down and explained that I went through my samples and put together a free bag for anyone to take in my community. I was surprised when she said that I should have given them to her ü§£! 

For context, a week or so ago she mentioned not wanting any more perfumes or body mists because she has too many. Turns out she only meant full size bottles so, new samples and minis don‚Äôt count üòÇüíÅüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. She said she wants to try some more new perfumes and let me know that she‚Äôd be happy to receive more in the future ‚ú®. 

I‚Äôm seeing her tomorrow so like the good daughter and fragrance fairy I am, I will be blessing her with some bounty. I also extended an invite to her to come over and shop some of my other samples. There are some that I‚Äôm not looking to readily give away, but if she were to really want them, I‚Äôd happily give them to her. She said she‚Äôd love to do that together so I‚Äôm super excited!!!! 

Here‚Äôs a little breakdown of what I‚Äôm giving away to her and why:

Kayali Yum Pistachio Gelato: This is my other sample and I have a dupe from Five Below that I prefer. I won‚Äôt miss the OG üßöüèæ.

Nette Th√© Vanille: It‚Äôs very interesting and unique but the savory turmeric and strong, salty marine notes are a no for me. I found it nauseating and it was a scrubber for me. However, I think I might be okay with smelling it on someone else. 

Jo Malone Peony & Blush Suede: It‚Äôs nice but it doesn‚Äôt feel like me. I don‚Äôt feel any connection with it, and I don‚Äôt want to smell like suede - not even a little bit. 

Valentino Donna Born in Roma: I like this one but I have a coffret of it already and don‚Äôt use it enough to warrant keeping a brand new sample. Also, Ulta gives out Donna Born in Roma samples like hot cakes üòÇ. I‚Äôm a frequent Ulta shopper so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll come across another for free.

Yves Saint Laurent Libre: I just cannot get into Libre. It no longer smells like root beer to me, but I‚Äôm finding that I don‚Äôt tend to like detectable lavender in perfumes on me. The lavender sits weirdly on my skin and I don‚Äôt like the way it smells. So far, Curations by The Good Scent Manifest Your Happiness has the only lavender note that I‚Äôve ever been able to detect and like on me.

Yves Saint Laurent Libre Florale: Libre Florale starts out as a promising solar, beachy white floral fragrance, but about ten minutes into the dry down, it takes a sharp turn for the worst on my skin. It gets really loud and pungent. It‚Äôs so bad. I wish I could properly explain what it smells like. It just smells so rancid. My mom and I have tried the same fragrances side by side and some that smell awful on me, smell lovely on her. So, perhaps that‚Äôll be the case with Libre Florale.

Prada Candy: Although I was supposed to give this away a while ago, I ended up fishing it out of the give away bag to try again later. I tried it again later and I feel the same way about it. It largely smells like nothing on my skin. I even tried applying a crap ton!!! It smells like the faintest whisper of that weird synthetic orange and warm cotton ball smell that Juliette Has A Gun Not Perfume also smells like on my skin. 

Versace Dylan Light Blue: Akin to Prada Candy,  Versace Dylan Light Blue is one that I dug out of the give away back to try again later. I tried it again later and well, it smelled like dill pickles. I love dill pickles, I‚Äôm gonna eat some after I finish this post, but I don‚Äôt need to smell like them. Perhaps my mom will have better luck and it won‚Äôt smell like pickles on her.

Jo Malone Wood Sage & Sea Salt: same as Prada Candy, minus the difficulty smelling it and the candy bit. I don‚Äôt get any of the notes listed on the inside of the little card (ambrette seeds, sea salt, and sage). 

Kilian Apple Brandy: I think Apple Brandy smells great, but it‚Äôs far too boozy for me. It‚Äôs so strong that it kind of singes my nose hairs. It also smells too masculine for my tastes. To be honest, I don‚Äôt really think my mom will like it but she‚Äôs surprised me in the past with some of the things she‚Äôs gravitated toward and that end up smelling/looking great on her! I have another sample of it that I‚Äôm hoping I can get my husband to wear üòó. I love when he wears boozy colognes/heavily scented lotions and those types of scents are usually his favs (ex. Bath & Body Works Coffee & Whiskey and Bourbon are some of his favorite body care and fragrance scents).

The first picture was my little set up for the selection process and the second is what I ended up getting together for her.

Here‚Äôs a 10-step plan for economic revival:

1. Diversify Beyond Copper

	‚Ä¢	Partner with private industries to align training with job market needs.

5. Improve Infrastructure
	‚Ä¢	Build and maintain roads, railways, and digital networks to connect rural and urban economies.
	‚Ä¢	Upgrade ports and trade corridors to enhance exports and regional trade.

6. Promote Local Manufacturing and Value Addition
	‚Ä¢	Encourage processing raw materials locally rather than exporting them in raw form.
	‚Ä¢	Incentivize factories for goods like textiles, food products, and construction materials.

7. Expand Access to Finance
	‚Ä¢	Support small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with affordable loans and grants.
	‚Ä¢	Promote mobile banking and digital platforms for easier transactions.

8. Reform Public Debt and Fiscal Policies
	‚Ä¢	Restructure existing debt and promote transparency in future borrowing.
	‚Ä¢	Broaden the tax base without overburdening citizens and businesses.

9. Boost Tourism and Culture

Brief summary, I am an autistic millennial who try‚Äôs my best to keep me and my girlfriend together. The past 2 months she‚Äôs been constantly threatening to kill me in front of me, and then I snooped through her phone and she want‚Äôs to take her dads double barrel and blow my head ‚Äúsmooth off‚Äù from what I‚Äôve read, she sent that to all her friends, this all started ever since my grandma died and I inherited 320k (around there but this could be a coincidence) it has worsened since she came over my parents house with me 1 1/2 month ago when she was stealing jewelry from my mom and my dad pushed her out of the house which somehow breaking her hand. I tried helping her and calming her down but she kept blaming me and guilt tripping me about random things.

You might be wondering why I‚Äôm putting this on AITAH? Well our most recent fight concluded in somewhat a physical battle when I came home from work and she broke multiple things of mine and tried forcing me out of the house when I pay for pretty much everything. So my first reaction was to talk her out of it and she went over to my rare Nintendo games and ps5, taking a mallet and knocking them over (my ps5 is not harmed just has a cracked plate luckily) and she destroyed half my Nintendo games which costed me 40$+ each about. My reaction was one that was influenced and filled with rage, just thinking about her destroying my stuff even though I love her, something had to be done. I jumped over the couch (not even touching it, it was about 3 feet that‚Äôs how angry I was) and grabbed her arm and swung her around (she is about 130LBS and 5‚Äô4‚Äù and I‚Äôm 258 and 5‚Äô6 1/2‚Äù) and pushed her into our glass coffee table, cutting her up a bit, I then kicked her out of rage bruising her rib rage pretty bad, I hope everyone can forgive me, I was just so filled with built up rage and frustration from the past months. She is living with her parents right now and I wanna apologize but I have hope in this relationship because she texted me saying she told her parents she got hit by a car just for now. I really wanna keep this because we‚Äôve done so much and she also took my virginity and that holds a lot to me, she‚Äôs just been super toxic.

I can usually only handle one primary at a time, with long gaps of sometimes a month in between seeing my fwbs/casual partners. I often want to spend entire weekends by myself, I‚Äôll need days being inside after a big outing. A nice date for me is often just grabbing a coffee for an hour. 

Normally this doesn‚Äôt bug me too much, and I don‚Äôt get much FOMO. However I recently started seeing a new person and I am feeling a bit self conscious about it. I feel like she‚Äôs going to events like‚Ä¶ 3-5x a week, she‚Äôs technically single rn but has started seeing me more seriously as well as one other girl. 

Idk, I think I‚Äôm just scared I‚Äôm going to seem too boring or sleepy or sensitive. She‚Äôs done nothing to make me feel bad about this, this is my own personal anxiety. I just can‚Äôt help but feel a bit paranoid that as we get more serious she‚Äôs going to want me to match her energy more and I won‚Äôt be able to, or more shiny extroverted people will seem more appealing. 

I feel like there are so many people I‚Äôve had casual connections with where we get on really well but I just know it could never go further bc I wouldn‚Äôt be able to match their energy or support them socially in a way I think they‚Äôd prefer. I really like this person and thinking about those past connections makes me nervous. 

Anyways, if any other poly introverts have felt this way and would like to chime in about if this resonates with you, or if you worked through something similar, please leave me a comment ‚ò∫Ô∏è 

Edit: I want to add that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a boring person! I have lots of hobbies, I‚Äôm good at talking. Idk I just feel like I live in a culture (US) that really values extroversion!",7,1740289551.0,polyamory,1,1.0,False

On paper, I seem very functional -- I attend an Ivy League, have great grades, was accomplished in high school -- so a very cookie-cutter grade A Asian. However, I developed a bad binge eating disorder 8 months ago that made me think I have ADHD.

For starters, I have always had a problem with emotional eating. While I was naturally thin my entire life, I found that I couldn't study / work unless I had a snack every 1-2 hours. When I got to college, I was constantly eating during my lectures. I never ate lunch alone. It was also a combination of mini snacks (popcorn, juice pouches, gummies) that I ate in class to keep me focused. I used food as a reward for studying, for study breaks, and for attending class -- without it, I would not been able to study like I did.

I later developed a restrictive ED because of my terrible bad image (which I feel like might be related to ADHD?). This eventually led to me hyper fixating on food and my brain did a complete 180 -- I have severe issues with binge eating now. I view it as a game: because I am on a college campus, I often ""hunt"" for my food -- ie rummage through trash, enter prohibited areas, and steal food. It's like a treasure hunt for me.. it's so stimulating and there's a reward (the food!)

I got prescribed with Vyvanse 2 days ago. I'm on 30mg and it's been extremely helpful in treating my binge eating urges. I also found that there's only a subtle effect, namely, my personality is still the same except I : don't have as much negative dialogue in my head and I'm able to initiate on tasks quicker. Besides the BED, here are reasons why I think I might have ADHD:

1. Fluctuating Moods: I've always had the issue of being a different person every day as a child. I think my emotional regulation skills are absolutely terrible, and people often commented on how I was quick to change attitudes / moods.
2. Unable to initiate tasks: I've spent a lot of my life motivating myself to do a task. I'll think about it.. want to do it, but be unable to get out of bed to do it.
3. Need for constant breaks: I've never been the kind of person to power through 5 hours of the same thing. When I study, I change locations maybe 1-2 hours, go to the bathroom for ""fun,"" or post on Reddit so I have something I can spontaneously check up on for ""dopamine upvotes""
4. Continuous self dialogue: I ALWAYS have a continuous dialogue in my head. I'm always making observations about everything. Think about when I'm going to eat, how I should do the laundry, how today is going to be tiring, how I am thinking about thinking .. all the damn time. I actually exhaust myself sometimes from thinking so much.
5. Bad at social commitments: I'm so bad at social commitments. It's never that I don't want to hang out with a friend, but oftentimes when events are scheduled and the day of the event arrives, I spontaneously don't feel the mood for it anymore? Also I guess scheduling events always feel dreadful to me. I never work well with schedules.
6. No schedules, calendars, planners: I do everything by memory. I've tried so many times to use a planner or be consistent with a schedule. Can't do it. Everything I do is based on vibes.
7. No long-term hobbies: I am good at being new at things, but never good at being good at things. I've dabbled in video editing, photography, poetry, computer programming with all these new projects like starting an app or building a magazine but I spend the first weeks dedicated all my time into it just to burn out later.
8. Bad at being socially ""in"": I feel out of touch with most people? I find it hard to situate myself with a friend group because I get bored of people easily and it takes scheduling commitments. I often find myself alone even though I do crave the social presence of others.
9. Coffee makes me sleepy. Low carb diets make me more level headed. Sugar makes me feel like I've amped up my¬†*gogogo*¬†brain.
10. Regular things feel hard: I have such bad hygiene. I go weeks without showering even though I hate being dirty because it's so fucking boring to stand under hot water and like bathe yourself. I have a hard time brushing my teeth. I even started not washing my hands.

1iw32mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1iw32mr/lots_of_issues_to_resolve_with_the_new_less_than/,Lots of issues to resolve with the new (less than a year old) Scottsdale Caesars Republic - Hilton,"I booked this hotel on a 5th night free deal with points and I‚Äôm Diamond. 

I was upgraded from a standard 2 queen room to a king Mountain View room. 

Arrive at noon and our room was understandably not ready. We were notified at around 3 of the room being available. 

At no point during check in were we told that the $30 per day credit was only good at the convenience store or Pronto (breakfast spot). Fortunately I found out about it on day 3 and we had been to Pronto on day 2 and I hit the conscience store for $30 worth of water on day 3. 

We spent $300 for dinner at Luna and had purchased drinks at Seven during our first 2 nights but this didn‚Äôt count towards our credit. 

Luna was highly disappointing. The lemon spaghetti sauce was broken/grainy and the rest of the food was meh. The service and wine were both excellent as were the cookies for dessert. 

Housekeeping was hit and miss. Day one - a used (by us) washcloth was left in the shower. Trash and used glasses were not removed and toilet paper was not refreshed causing us to completely run out of TP on day 3. The shower has no shelf or soap dish for bar soap or personal toiletries (facial cleanser, razor etc). The shower was stocked with 2 conditioners and 1 shampoo - no shower gel. When I requested shower gel, it was left on the counter rather than being installed so I ended up perching it on top of the duplicate conditioner since there was no where else to put it. Day 2 housekeeping didn‚Äôt come at all even when though we were gone from 9-1 and after 5. I had to go to the front desk at 10 pm after returning from dinner to ask for fresh towels, coffee pods, Kleenex (because we were had been out of TP) and TP. It all got left in a pile on the countertop.

Additional design issues include the lighting - entry hall lighting is very dim and not adequate to even see my suitcase while situated on the luggage rack. It‚Äôs unclear and not intuitive what turns off all lighting. (Bedside light won‚Äôt go off and on sometimes- despite some lights being on). However, I did appreciate the bedside plug ins which were very convenient and the place to set my phone while using the toilet. 

We also had issues with the valet parking. I texted (as instructed) and got no reply. After 20 minutes I went to the front desk to inquire if I had done something wrong and was told they were short staffed. My car was brought around 5 minutes later. 

I will share an update as this unfolds, but this hotel is coming up on its one year anniversary soon and it just has a LOT of issues. This hotel is duel Hilton and Caesar‚Äôs so I will try to figure out how to tag that group if it exists.

Infused with Art Deco inspiration, each piece features matte gold frames that hold up the top and bottom shelves. The top is made of faux marble in a glorious white shade with subtle variations in color. The sides add texture to an otherwise sterile piece - reeded panels curve around the corners and conceal a storage drawer for a slick, contemporary look.

I know this is a long shot without having photos of there walls itself..... Maybe I will repost when I have some?

I am trying to create ANY wall texture.... hear me out...and see some links below please. üôè

I've got a rental and it definitely needs some love on the walls in the bedrooms and hallway.

2 - 10x12 and one 12x14 maybe. Rest of house is looking great!

Not necessarily caring for any specific design, I am merely trying to hide the ugly ass walls that have been painted over, paint droplets, tape lines, etc. Tenants damaged the scheniekes out of one wall as well ripping wallpaper off, etc. and covering it up. Ugh.

Needless to say, I WANT the randomness. I want to hide as much as possible. I am capable of dedicating the time to do this, however....as I need to get people in the property asap...I'm hoping ü§û to do all this within 7-10 days, realistically. Averaging one bedroom per day for doing and drying. Then sanding/painting. Airing out.

I was thinking about ""floating/skimming"" this [ROLL ON TEXTURE](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Homax-Roll-on-texture-2-Gallon-White-Popcorn-Wall-And-Ceiling-Texture/3648062) from Lowes...and then using something like this to create a different look there---> [LINK to PAINT ROLLER](https://www.amazon.com/Hanroy-Texture-Painting-Decorators-Pattern/dp/B0D1G3CLQH/ref=rvi_d_sccl_4/146-9284719-0230920?pd_rd_w=alwkG&content-id=amzn1.sym.f5690a4d-f2bb-45d9-9d1b-736fee412437&pf_rd_p=f5690a4d-f2bb-45d9-9d1b-736fee412437&pf_rd_r=T3NA51ZGV7FW5RPAHMTC&pd_rd_wg=EM6Y0&pd_rd_r=4691748d-2bf9-4b52-afef-10d813e868ac&pd_rd_i=B0B8ZBRM6V&th=1) Amazon. Would this work? OR, is this too lightweight, versus say using a foam roller?

With these two products, do you think I can do something like the photo, or anything more hardcore? Texture wise. I'll paint afterwards. Swiss Coffee.

Any suggestions?  
Any OTHER suggestions TOTALLY welcome.

1iw2ww8,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1iw2ww8/life_hacks_that_actually_hack_life/,Life Hacks That Actually Hack Life?,"I've been in this community for about a month now. Y'all need help. I'm most likely contributing to that very reason y'all need help, so I'd like to try and contribute something that *doesn't* piss off the entire community. No insults, no dirty talk (yet!), just an unfinished list of some self-improvement life hacks that could actually improve your life. Why unfinished? Because there's always room for growth. As long as there's room for growth, there's always room for more great advice on this list.

*Note: This is primarily stuff I either currently do or has helped myself and others in the past.*

¬†

**Goals**: I hate that I was 33 when I learned about setting S.M.A.R.T goals from one of my Master Chiefs. This model is stupid simple, yet highly effective. Just follow along, you'll get it:

**Specific**

* Your goal must be clear and precise
* What exactly do you want to achieve?
* No vague objectives
* EX: Instead of saying ""I want to get in shape,"" I would start with ""I want to do 10 pull-ups."" It's a specific number, instead of something arbitrary, meaning you now have a set number you can reach

**Measurable**

* This is your time-table. How will you track it? There MUST be a realistic way to track it on paper, or on an Excel spreadsheet, or a Word document. Something material
* This is the equivalent of quarterly reviews in business
* EX: Currently I can do 0 pull-ups, and I want to do 10 pull-ups. That means by March (The date is currently 23FEB2025), I'd like to work my way up to 1 pull-up, and if I continue exercising and monitoring my diet, I should be able to do 3 pull-ups by May. This is part of tracking

**Achievable**

* Is this doable?
* If you've never done a single pull-up in your life, and you weigh 210 pounds with very little muscle, it is absolutely unreasonable to say ""I want to do 10 pull-ups by next month"" because you need to give yourself a reasonable amount of time to develop the necessary muscles to achieve that goal
* Start small. Don't take on a marathon if you can barely run a mile

**Realistic/Relevant**

* Make sure the goal aligns with your life, your values, or your objectives. I'm in the Military, so it makes sense I would set personal fitness goals
* Make sure it's worth your time and effort. There is no reason for me to want to learn how to speak Vietnamese, it's irrelevant to my life
* Make sure it's a realistic goal. I had terrible grades in High School, I'm unfocused, and I'm a college drop-out. There is no world where I will look at my peers and say ""I want to study Law at Harvard"" without getting laughed out of the room

**Timeliness**

* Set a deadline. I want to do 10 pull-ups. Okay, when? Give yourself a reasonable timeline to reach
* EX: I want to do 10 pull-ups by December
* Okay, this is much better
* Do NOT keep pushing towards a goal you will hit ""some day"" because ""some day"" will NEVER come

**Better Sleep:** I learned this from a Redditor, and unfortunately I don‚Äôt remember who or where, but someone once suggested the ‚Äú4-3-2-1‚Äù rule.

* Have your last meal **4 hours** before bed time
* Drink a big glass of water **3 hours** before bed time
* Take a hot shower **2 hours** before bed time
* Turn off all screens **1 hour** before bed time
* Do all that, and you‚Äôll get the best sleep you ever got in your entire life, without waking up to go pee in the middle of the night.

**ADHD Life Hacks:** I‚Äôm super ADHD, so here are some things that helped me out

* I pack my gym clothes in my backpack every night before I go to bed, because we go to PT after work and I need my gym clothes
* That 1 hour of no screen time does not mean I can‚Äôt listen to audio, so I put on a podcast and use that time to fold my laundry, clean the kitchen, and do a quick sweep around the house. Clean house is a happy house. Less cleaning wife does, happier wife is.
* When I run, I listen to epic music. I‚Äôm a *HUGE* fan of Thomas Bergersen. He influences the music I write, and that ‚Äúgoing into battle‚Äù music helps me get to that ‚Äúrunner‚Äôs high‚Äù
* **KEEP YOUR VALUABLES IN THE SAME SPOT NO MATTER WHAT!** We call this the ‚ÄúEverything has a home rule‚Äù. Keys, wallet, cell phone, pocket knife, duty phone, any essentials that come with me to work is **ALWAYS** at the same spot. My brain is on autopilot when I‚Äôm getting ready in the morning, if the stuff I need isn‚Äôt there when I leave, it‚Äôs not coming with me, and I won‚Äôt know it didn‚Äôt come with me until it‚Äôs too late.
* Taking a quick walk in sunlight first thing in the morning before coffee helps reset your brain chemistry. It's like a natural reboot sequence. I wrote this in a previous post, and I united the entire Midwest to form a bond of hatred against me since doing it, but for those of us who actually have an amiable relationship with the sun, it‚Äôs a godsend.
* Make your bed immediately after waking up. Even if your day goes to shit, you've still accomplished something.
* I learned this from another Redditor that I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôve forgotten, but they suggested that when going through a breakup, delete their number but write it down and give it to a friend first. That way you can't drunk text, but if there's a legit reason to contact them later, you're not completely cut off.
* If you can complete the task in 2 minutes, do it now.
* Every time you finish a task, write it in a log. Instead of a ‚Äúto-do‚Äù list, you‚Äôre creating a ‚Äúcompleted side quests‚Äù list. It feels good knowing you accomplished so much.
* Don‚Äôt know how to cook? Everything in life is either a sandwich or a soup. Once you accept this, cooking gets way easier. Being ADHD means managing 50 different ingredients gets overwhelming, so this should help you out.
* Post-it notes are your new god. Need to remember it? Post it on your computer desk, or next to your TV when playing video games. Make sure you will see as a constant reminder until the task is complete.
* Set an alarm 2 weeks before anyone‚Äôs birthday ‚Äì *ESPECIALLY* if it‚Äôs your wife‚Äôs birthday, or anniversary.
* Replace coffee with matcha. My wife forced this evil on me, but the results are unquestionable.

**Drinking:** Some life hacks for hitting the club.

* Before going out to the bar/club, keep the following on your counter:
   * Tylenol
   * A glass of water
   * A Gatorade
   * You‚Äôll feel muuuuuch better the next day and will most likely dodge a hangover. Unless you‚Äôre 35 like me, in which case, yeahhhh there‚Äôs no dodging that. Those days are over, my friend.
* If you are my age, implement the ‚ÄúBathroom rule‚Äù for alcohol. If you wouldn't lick it off a bathroom floor, stop drinking it when you're out. This essentially means that you‚Äôre now at the age where you need to start drinking good, premium drinks, instead of that candy-colored sugar cocktail mixes that will *obliterate* your head the next day. If you wouldn‚Äôt devolve to ‚ÄúWILSOOOONNN!!!!‚Äù levels of depressed upon spilling it, don‚Äôt order it.
* If she can barely stand, don‚Äôt bring her home you fucking degenerate.

**Vitamins:** The only Vitamins your realistically need ‚Äì if you insist on taking any ‚Äì are the following:

* B12 1000 MCG (take after breakfast)
* D3 125MCG (take after breakfast)
* Fish Oil Omega-3 1000 mg (take after breakfast)
* Magnesium **GLYCINATE** (take after dinner) - *This specific form is important, do* ***NOT*** *get Magnesium Citrate, as it will make you shit your brains out!*
* That's it. The rest is fluff and unnecessary, unless recommended by your doctor.

**Dealing with Schoolyard Bullies:** Punch in the nose. No, I don't give a fuck what anyone says. Literally *anyone* who's ever been bullied in school will tell you this. Get suspended, go to Saturday School - the teachers are only trying to watch their own backs, so the best way to deal with the problem swiftly and permanently is a well-timed punch in the nose. Even if you lose the fight, they'll leave you alone afterwards because they want a punching bag, not someone who's a nuisance to deal with.

**Dealing with workplace bullies:** Punch in the **NO!** Gray Rock method. When you're encountering assholes at work who like to fuck with you, develop the personality of a gray rock. Give boring, non-engaging responses. They usually move on.

* Additionally, document ***EVERYTHING***. Put it on paper. Leave a trail. If it becomes out of hand and you have documentation, you will make HR's life easier and they'll most likely take your side out of convenience.
* Stand your ground. Don't be a pushover. Any time they say something unprofessional to you or try to antagonize you, look them directly in the eye, pull out a notepad, and loudly write ""At \[time/date\], Mr./Ms. \[name\] said the following to me:"" or ""This employee has conducted the following unprofessional activity:"" or any combination thereof. The moment you show them you're putting everything they do to paper, they'll likely move on because they probably enjoy their income.
* Do not give immature, unprofessional people a single second of your time. You have better shit to do.
* ""No"" is a complete sentence.

**Dealing with your boss:** Get everything in writing. In the Navy, they tell us any time an Officer or supervisor gives us tasking, we need to get it on paper. Any time something is promised to us, get it in writing. Nothing pisses off higher management more than a paper trail that risks making them look like a liar. And it eliminates deniability. *Especially* if your boss is asking you to do something either illegal or unethical.

* Save emails, screenshot texts
* Note dates and times of incidents
* Have witnesses when possible
* Forward work emails to personal account if documenting workplace issues
* Keep responses professional and minimal but clear
* Again, ""no"" is a complete sentence

**Tough decisions:** The 10-10-10 rule. How will you feel about this choice 10 minutes from now? 10 months? 10 years?

**If you're having trouble focusing on work, put on video game soundtracks.** They're literally designed to help you focus and feel epic while doing mundane tasks.

**Want to read more?** Put your books in the bathroom. You‚Äôre gonna be there anyway, and it‚Äôs better than doom scrolling.

**Meal Prepping**: Buy those rotisserie chickens from the store. Cheap protein that's already cooked, and you can use the bones for soup stock.

**Waking up in the morning:** Put your phone on the other side of the room before bed. Having to physically get up to turn off the alarm stops the snooze cycle.

**Dogs are a gateway to social interaction.** You have to walk them, and most people enjoy saying hello to a friendly puppy. I may be slightly biased on this one.

**Learning a musical instrument develops focus.** Musicianship is a lifetime commitment, but it‚Äôs a hell of a hobby to learn, and a great way to vent out all of that pent up frustration you have with life.

**Keep a ""car box"" with basic emergency stuff:** Blanket, flashlight, phone charger, basic tools, snacks, water. Future-you might really need it.

**Essential Tools and smart placement:**

* Kitchen area:
   * Basic ratchet set under sink (like you said - perfect for plumbing fixes)
   * Small adjustable wrench
   * Multi-bit screwdriver
   * Pliers
   * Gorilla Glue (this stuff is magic)
   * WD-40 (under sink, away from food areas)
* Bathroom:
   * Plunger (before you need it!)
   * Small pliers
   * Screwdriver
   * Drain snake/cleaner
   * Caulk and caulk gun
* Next to the breaker box:
   * Flashlight (that actually works)
   * Voltage tester
   * Basic screwdriver
   * Written list of what each breaker controls
* Bedroom/Office area/Living Room:
   * Small tool kit for furniture assembly
   * Measuring tape
   * Level
   * Picture hanging kit
* General Placement:
   * Keep tools where you'll actually use them
   * Have duplicates of basics (screwdrivers, pliers) on each floor
   * Store in waterproof containers if under sinks
   * Label everything (future-you will forget what's where)
* Tools everyone MUST have:
   * Hammer
   * Ratchet set
   * A good power drill
   * Stud finder
   * Set of Allen wrenches
   * Wire strippers
   * Utility knife
   * Duct tape

**3 Things my father taught me to keep on me at all times:**

1. A pen and notepad. You never know when you need to write something down, and phones die.
2. A pocket knife. For self defense - better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6. Old school advice, but you'll need it when walking through sketchy areas.
3. $100 emergency cash, broken down specific: four $20s, one $10, two $5s. Why? Because when your car breaks down in the middle of nowhere and the card reader is ""down,"" cash is king. Used to be $20 was enough, but welcome to inflation.

**Invest in good kitchenware.** Cooking is a part of life, so it‚Äôs best to get a good set.

* Knives: Stainless Steel is easier to manage, while carbon is sharper, but it requires oil and consistent maintenance.
* Pots and pans: Avoid sets, buy individual pieces you'll actually use.
* Never put good knives in the dishwasher.
*  Learn how to maintain cast iron. Cast iron is one of the single greatest pieces of kitchenware you will ever get. It can handle ANYTHING, and it‚Äôs built to last for a lifetime.
* Quality pays for itself over time.
* An emulsion blender = free mayonnaise for life. Drop an egg, some oil, mustard and lemon juice in the container it comes in, a little bzzzt bzzt, and BAM! Instant mayo that‚Äôs better than store bought.
   * Also good for soup puree, perfect sauces, salad dressing, blending desserts, there are soooo many options I couldn‚Äôt possibly imagine them all.
* An air fryer is your best friend when raising kids (heard this from my sister).
* A rice cooker is your best friend if your wife is Filipina.
* A good blender is your best friend when exploring nutrition, juices, and smoothies
* A food processor is your best friend if you value your time in the kitchen

**Learn to cut up a whole chicken.** A whole chicken is muuuuch cheaper than buying individual parts. With a single bird, you get:

* 2 chicken boobs (with tendies)
* 2 thighs
* 2 drumsticks
* 2 wings
* Bones for stock (free soup base
* Skin for rendering, or chips (also free oil)
* It‚Äôs multiple meal for one purchase, and better quality for less money

**When to DIY, and when to call a professional:** Most household maintenance can be done yourself, but there are times when you‚Äôll need to call a professional. Here‚Äôs a small list:

**DIY (These can be Googled, watch a YouTube video, or you can ask ChatGPT)**:

* Basic repairs
   * Drywall holes and cracks
   * Painting walls/trim
   * Fixing squeaky doors
   * Replacing doorknobs
   * Tightening loose screws
   * Cabinet hardware
   * Weatherstripping
   * Light switch plates
* Bathroom
   * Unclog drains (basic clogs)
   * Replace shower head
   * Fix running toilet
   * Replace toilet seat
   * Recaulk tub/shower
   * Replace toilet flapper
* General Maintenance
   * Change air filters
   * Replace light bulbs/fixtures
   * Clean gutters (single story)
   * Basic landscaping
   * Pressure washing
   * Window screens
   * Change smoke detector batteries
   * Basic furniture assembly

**When to call a professional:**

* Electrical
   * New wiring
   * Circuit issues
   * Panel work
   * Adding outlets
   * Ceiling fan installation
   * Major lighting changes
* Plumbing
   * Pipe repairs/replacement
   * Water heater issues
   * Sewer line problems
   * Major clogs
   * New fixture installation
   * **ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES GAS!!!**
* Structural
   * Roof repairs
   * Foundation issues
   * Wall removal
   * Window replacement
   * Door installation
   * Any load-bearing work (This means construction, such as building an extension to your house, or fixing beams that connect your attic)
* Major systems
   * HVAC repairs/installation
   * Major appliance repair
   * Tree removal
   * Concrete work
   * Anything needing permits
   * Mold remediation
   * Pest control (If you try to DIY you‚Äôll likely poison your pets)
* Some considerations
   * If it involves water, gas, or electricity behind walls - call a pro
   * If you need a permit - call a pro
   * If you have to ask ""will this kill me or the neighbor?"" - call a pro
   * If it affects structural integrity - call a pro
   * If flooding/emergency - call a pro immediately

**Social Interactions.** Some basics in talking to people

* Eye contact. It‚Äôs respectful.
* I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard this, but if you suspect someone is lying to you or trying to fib their way out of accountability, just be silent and let them keep talking.
* If you‚Äôre like me and you struggle with constipation of the brain; diarrhea of the mouth, count to 3, take a deeeeeep breath, and then respond.
* If you get anxious, take another deep breath to slow down your cadence. People who talk fast make others nervous.
* Ask questions about what people just said instead of waiting to share your story.
* Remember people's names by associating them with something specific they mentioned.
* When someone tells you their name, use it in a sentence right away.
* People love talking about themselves - let them.
* Mirror people's posture subtly - creates comfort.
* Keep palms visible when gesturing - builds trust.
* Face your feet toward people you're talking to - shows engagement.
* Stand at a slight angle in groups - less confrontational.
* Be friendly with custodial/security/admin staff - they run the place.
* When asked something you don't know, say ""Let me look that up"" instead of bullshitting. Admitting ignorance earns respect; lying loses it.
* Keep gum/mints handy.
* Have a clean joke ready. Higher-ups often start meetings with ""anyone know a good joke?""
* Learn to give genuine compliments about things people can control (choices, not features).
* When everyone's taking photos, offer to take them - then someone will offer to take one with you in it.

**Conflict resolution that doesn‚Äôt involve punching people in the nose:**

* Use ""I"" statements: ""I feel"" vs ""You always"".
* Acknowledge what was said before responding.
* Take a breath before reacting.
* If someone's angry, speak slower and quieter.

I honestly don't know how to feel other than disappointed when I tried to talk to him as best as I could because I have a bit of a hard time starting conversations, let alone flirting, I literally don't know how to flirt but I try to seem as calm as possible so I just seem like a cool but calm girl, last year I asked for an opinion in a private group and they told me not to try anymore, though I don't know, I would like to let the guy know that I liked him at the time and tried my best to start a conversation with him on WhatsApp or have my own friend tell him, currently I consider it a waste of time to show the guy that I was really interested in him and that if I got to a point of feeling emboldened I would have asked him if we could go for coffee or just go for a walk. It's a feeling mixed with disappointment after knowing that he also shared the feeling but he didn't try to do anything even when I tried to start a conversation with everything my unsocial self could muster. 

 For context: last year I was a freshman in college and I have a pretty close friend that I made there, we became pretty close to the point that we could have been mistaken for a couple because we were always together at any activity, we both made ugly faces at it because I didn‚Äôt see it that way either and he‚Äôs gay so it was a flat out no, although the jokes between the two of us were never lacking about our supposed relationship. When October of last year came around I found myself attracted to a classmate who was close to my friend, he told me that this guy (who by the way is the dreamy type) had written to him on WhatsApp asking if we were a couple because of how close we were, hearing this gave me a little or rather some hope thinking that maybe there was a remote possibility that he was interested in me the way he saw it even though we never talked except for joint work, the only ‚Äòchat‚Äô I had with him was just a very small chat in the elevator that lasted less than a minute.  After this I worked up the courage to reply to a WhatsApp status he posted, my fingers were even shaking, I felt like I was going to confess my feelings to him even though I wasn't going to, one of the reasons is that I have a bit of a hard time starting normal conversations, after the second message I posted to try to prolong the conversation (sadly with the help of some stupid internet advice), I felt like he didn't want to talk to me and the conversation was quite awkward, I felt like he was trying to force a conversation so I gave up at that point out of pure disappointment and resignation to this. I must also say that I saw the guy often as we shared all the topics throughout the year, it wasn't overnight that I liked him, it wasn't until October that I became fully aware that I was attracted to him. 

 I was currently talking to this friend after not seeing him for several days (because I changed careers) and between chats he told me that the guy really fell in love with me and that's why he asked if we were a couple, I feel disappointed and with feelings that I can't describe with more than that, the guy falls in love easily according to what my friend told me because now he was in love with another girl, now I just wish he knew that at one time I was really attracted to him but I don't see the point in him knowing this.",1,1740288284.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

He told me to fight like I'm really boxing someone. 

This shit is INTENSE!

I was only able to play one match where I hilariously got knocked out.

I came to several realizations:

1. I'm am in absolutely horrible shape. I wouldn't be able to seriously protect myself if something was to really happen. I don't think I've ran full speed in 10 years. My chest was on fire!


2. I really need to work on my fighting technique. I haven't been in a fist fight since highschool. Boxing was always something I wished my mother put me in as a child but we didn't have the funds. Being able to do this in VR without the brain damage is amazing.  


3. I don't know what's better cardio? Clappin cheeks or this game. I woke up the next day and my whole upper body was sore. I've never done anything remotely that strenuous even at the gym. I could barely wipe my ass after my morning coffee dump. 


I'm saving up for a Meta Quest 3 and I want to surprise my brother with one as well. His 4 year old daughter accidentally broke his about a week ago and there's a crack along the middle of the glasses. 


Can't wait to see what the future holds for this game! It's the most fun I've had gaming in many years and can't wait to play more.

If you're wondering, ""can you use a Target gift card at Starbucks,"" you're not alone. Many shoppers enjoy the convenience of using gift cards to purchase their favorite beverages, and understanding how to maximize their gift card options is essential.

Target gift cards are versatile and popular for a variety of shopping needs, but when it comes to Starbucks, the answer is not straightforward. Generally, Target gift cards are meant for use within Target stores or online at Target.com. Starbucks does not accept Target gift cards directly, so you can't simply swipe your Target gift card to pay for that Venti Caramel Macchiato.

However, there are alternative ways to use your Target gift card for Starbucks purchases:

- **Purchase Starbucks Gift Cards:** You can buy Starbucks gift cards using your Target gift card at a Target store. This way, you can convert your Target balance to Starbucks credit.
- **Mobile Payment Options:** If you have a Starbucks app, consider transferring funds from a linked card to your Starbucks account after purchasing a gift card at Target.
- **Combine Purchases:** If you're shopping at Target and plan to visit Starbucks, you can treat yourself to a drink after making a purchase.

Keep in mind that Starbucks has its own gift card ecosystem, and they often run promotions. If this sounds appealing, be sure to stay updated on sales and events, as you might find opportunities to enhance your coffee experience with extra rewards.

In summary, while you can't use a Target gift card directly at Starbucks, purchasing a Starbucks gift card at Target is a practical workaround. So, the next time you're in Target and craving a Starbucks treat, remember this tip to maximize your shopping experience!

I had noticed hair fall, and took vital proteins collagen in my coffee about a month and switched to a satin pillowcase.

Then saw these coming in and figured, regrowth with collagen, great. I thought it was maybe overprocessed highlighting that took some out.

Then I felt little bumps around there, and thought, that's normal to have some lumps and bumps on your head.

Then, for the last 3 weeks, I have had tiny ingrown hairs, breaking the surface, in a random curvy line. I finally used my phone and took pictures of this area I couldn't see on the back of my head. There was a very visible almost bald patch/line.

I have turned into an ingrown hair picking machine. It felt like a Barbie doll who had her hair chopped off with those little clumps sticking out. Also loops of hair barely poking out. Then the doll with hair that grows back, pulling out tons of baby soft hair like a clown pulling out handkerchiefs. I was constantly like wtf!

And googled and thought no, I am not going to a dermatologist for them to needle this stuff out. it feels like a little buzz cut coming in before I lift it out. And wild- I can lift out a chunk from my scalp slowly - some are growing sideways- and get it out.  I have used neosporin and tea trea oil on it, and fresh rosemary water spray, warm compress occasionally

One thing in peri that changed was also the back section of my lifelong stick straight hair becoming really wavy/curly.  But, this takes the cake!

Hi I'm 19M I love my family but sometimes it gets difficult staying with them. I didn't go to school after 7 till 11 and didn't go for 12th either due to financial reasons and so loneliness is pretty prominent in my life. I'm doing online college for now.

My mother is kind of opposite of your typical Indian mom's she will never miss a chance to berate me and put me down in any topic of conversation especially coffee and study.

She hates me if I drink coffee calls me nashedi and drug addict and she is not nice saying those things in a very nice way for certain I can't even type them here.

I told her I'm doing a data science course and it will take around 6 months, then she was like okay do it but anytime she feels stress she would just stop acknowledging that I'm doing anything saying bas ek course se thodi much hoga.

So there is one thing my father wants me to do and I was never included in the project in the first place so I was not prepared what to do, and one night I just asked how can I do it like asking for help and my mother got her chance to say I'm worse than my brother can't do one thing don't have intention to help my family, I won't survive a day outside world and all.

I got fed up and said I hate talking to her thus there is no need to care about my life and dont need her opinion from her let me be, because this has been going on for past 6 years and I cannot remember one day where she said anything good to me bas Har waqkt mere chota bhai ki tareef and mujhe kehna I'm nothing. And if I speak against her my whole family will make it a humongous issue ki me battamizi kar raja humongous and don't have any manners and ignore my existencein house for weeks and its reallyfuking me up now. 

Problem is last year I broke up with my girlfriend(still dealing with it) that also because of my mother and don't have any friend for now so I can't talk to anyone about it. Rn no one will talk to me and I'm kind of crashing out rn I feel hate towards her and whenever I think to tell my father he ignores me or say I'm wrong. What should I do???

    She got in the car and they drove to Cedarvale, listening to the bop & blues on station 139. There were not many cars out tonight, because of the curfew. Even Jackson street, which was usually bustling with nightlife, was dead silent. George‚Äôs eyes kept flickering to her, as if he was admiring her. 
   Now they were driving down the quiet street of Cedarvale, with large houses and big properties on either side of them. They slowed to a stop beside the curb, in front of one of the larger houses on the block. But it was not Nick Donnelly‚Äôs house, so she looked at George with a worried expression. 
   ‚ÄúWhy did we stop?‚Äù She asked,  ‚Äúis something wrong?‚Äù
   ‚ÄúNick called earlier and asked us not to park in front of his house. He doesn‚Äôt want the neighbors to know about the party because of the curfew. Also, it‚Äôs a school night and all that‚Äî‚Äú 
   She nodded, he cut the engine off. She put a coat on and they walked down the block, cicadas humming around them. The lights from Nick‚Äôs house shone through the trees as they reached the end of the block, and she clutched onto George‚Äôs hand. 
   They let themselves in through the gate, then walked up the path, and then she took a deep breath and knocked on the front door. All the curtains were drawn and the lights inside the house were turned off. For a moment she wondered if anyone was home, or, even worse, if they had gone to the wrong house. But then the door swung open and Nick and Elle King were both standing in the doorway. 
   ‚ÄúGeorge!‚Äù Nick said
   ‚ÄúNick‚Äî!‚Äù
   They both laughed, and then the two of them went down the hall. ‚ÄúMy mom left Martini‚Äôs in the cabinet. I only found out about them this morning.‚Äù Nick said, and then a light flickered on in the kitchen.    
  That left Frannie and Elle standing in the foyer together. 
  ‚ÄúHi, Elle.‚Äù 
  ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she said, and she smiled shyly. ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt mind, but I don‚Äôt think Dale and Carol are going to be able to make it tonight.‚Äù
  ‚ÄúOh no,‚Äù she asked, ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù 
  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said, shaking her head. ‚ÄúWe tried calling them, but they won‚Äôt pick up. Nick said he hasn‚Äôt seen them all day, either. They‚Äôre just gone.‚Äù
  She shook her head again. Frannie didn‚Äôt mention this, but she thought that too many people were going missing in Cascade Locks today, for her liking. 


  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî



  Thirty minutes later they were sitting in the living room. George and Nick sat on the couch in front of the coffee table, partaking in underage drinking. She sat in the chair beside it. It reminded her of the creepy chair in her grandfather's house in fairhope. At some point, Elle excused herself and walked upstairs to use the restroom. She could hear the creaking of footsteps coming from the upstairs hallway. 
  At that moment something caught her eye in one of the adjacent rooms. It looked like a bedroom. She blinked a few times, wondering if what she just  saw was real. But it couldn‚Äôt be, it was impossible 
   ‚ÄúYou alright?‚Äù George asked, as she saw her eyes dart up to the bedroom. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù
   ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, it looked like. . .‚Äù She shook her head. ‚ÄúNever mind, it doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù 
   Her eyes were still focused on the crack in the doorway, leading into the bedroom though. She could see the dark space underneath the bed, and then, without warning, a black creature darted out front underneath the bed, circled the bedpost, and then darted back under the bed again. 
   This time she actually stood up and shrieked, clapping her hands over her mouth. 
   ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù George looked at the door, then back at her. 
   ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but I keep seeing it! ‚Äù She cried.       
    Just then Elle‚Äôs footsteps came down the stairs and she reentered the living room. Her expression grew worried as she saw them. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù 
  ‚ÄúElle,‚Äù She swallowed, ‚ÄúSit in my chair.‚Äù 
  ‚ÄúWhat. . . why?‚Äù 
  ‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù 
  The creepy chair was the only chair in the house that had a vantage point into the bedroom, so the rest of them wouldn‚Äôt have been able to see it. Looking reluctant, Elle walked over and took her chair. 
   ‚ÄúNow, just sit there normally and watch the tv. I want you to tell me if you see it.‚Äù   
  ‚ÄúSee what?‚Äù Elle asked, but she didn‚Äôt answer. 
   For the next couple of minutes they sat there, and she kept glancing at Elle, hoping to see her eyes dart over to the bedroom. She hoped, because she knew Nick and George were probably thinking she was seeing things. 
   Then, sure enough, Elle‚Äôs eyes darted over to the bedroom, widened to the size of marbles. She jumped up from the chair and shrieked. 
   ‚ÄúI. . . I saw something,‚Äù she stammered, ‚ÄúIn the bedroom. It‚Äî‚Äú 
   ‚ÄúBedroom? What bedroom?‚Äù Nick asked, turning around. 
   She pointed to the room behind the cracked door. The room was dimly lit, with only one lamp lighting the room. 
   ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my parents' bedroom.‚Äù Nick said. 
   There was a long silence for a moment, as Elle continued to stare wide-eyed at the room. Both of them stared back at her, wondering if she was going to see it again, but a few more minutes passed and there was nothing.
  ‚ÄúNick, come sit in the chair.‚Äù Frannie said.
   He hesitated for a moment, but seeing the fear in both of their faces, he walked over to the chair, his movement tentative. ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôm sitting, but I‚Äôm telling you this is all just‚Äî‚Äú 
    ‚ÄúJust sit, Nick.‚Äù She interrupted, her voice firm. 
    They all waited and watched. He sat down, his eyes focused on the bedroom door. But this time the room remained eerily quiet. Inside, the lamp flickered a little bit. She could see it because the light casted on the wall dimmed. Nick glanced at them, and then looked back at the room. 
    ‚ÄúIf this is all just a trick‚Äî‚Äú
    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not,‚Äù Elle said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, there‚Äôs something in there.‚Äù 
   George was the only one who hadn‚Äôt sat in the chair yet, but he looked scared as well, even though he would never admit it. He was still on the couch, but his head was spun around in a way to where he could peer into the room. They waited, And for a moment, it seemed like nothing would happen at all. 
    And then Nick adjusted in his chair, and they all saw it. There was a faint, almost imperceptible shift in the room, like a creeping chill. The lamp flickered for a brief second, casting elongated shadows up the walls. And then a small, black creature darted out from underneath the bed, circled the bedpost, and then ran into the closet. 
    Nick practically exploded out of his seat, almost jumping to the ceiling. ‚ÄúThe hell?‚Äù 
   ‚ÄúThere‚Äî!‚Äù Elle said
   ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that!‚Äù
   ‚ÄúI saw it too!‚Äù George said
   This time Frannie got a good look at it herself, because it was out from underneath the bed for a long time, and she saw that it, whatever it was‚Äî was bipedal. It looked like a small, human shadow. Everything hat happened that day, from Mr Brown's  story, to the rocking chair on his porch, came flooding back into her mind. 
   Nick marched over to the room and shut the door. ‚ÄúThere! Now we don‚Äôt have to worry about it anymore.‚Äù

One of the teachers (M38), caught my attention. Shortly after, I learned that he was in a relationship, and didn‚Äôt think much of him for a while. 

In early January 2025, he messaged me on Instagram one day after class. This led to daily text conversations, calls, voice messages, etc. He began giving me special treatment in class (hands-on adjustments, playing songs I told him I like, massages in shavasana), intense flirting via text that frequently turned sexual, and ultimately I felt we developed a connection. It never reached physical connection, but it was emotional and constant communication. He only wanted to meet at odd times and places. Believe me, I realize this should have been a red flag, but I had been traveling for work quite a bit and he has an 11 year old son, so I figured he was just trying to make it work when he could. 

A week ago, his texts became infrequent, and he admitted he was still processing trauma from his past relationship. He said the relationship ended a few months ago, but he was still processing and he couldn‚Äôt give me the attention I deserved at the moment, but was still interested in me. 

A few days later, a friend saw a social media story showing him with the same girlfriend from last year. I messaged his girlfriend, who confirmed they were still together. She told me they had been dating for three years. 

The girlfriend and I met for coffee, and I shared all the information I had. She was incredibly kind and sweet. I learned she is only 25 years old, and they began dating three years ago. I realize I am only two years older than her, but their 13 year age gap alarmed me‚Äî especially when she told me he had cheated on her the previous summer, but ultimately won her back. I have also heard multiple rumors about this man since, regarding him cheating on her with different women.

Hey fellow Redditors,

Just wanted to take a moment to dive into the deep waters of mindfulness and the incredible power of living in the present moment. üåü Let's unite our thoughts and experiences and explore this profound concept together!

‚Ä¢ The Past vs. The Future: We often find ourselves stuck in the murky realms of the past or the tantalizing possibilities of the future. But what about the precious gift we currently possess‚Äîthe present?üéÅ

‚Ä¢ The Art of Mindfulness: Mindfulness is not merely a buzzword, my friends. It is a way of life that enables us to fully experience each passing moment. By engaging our five senses, we shift our focus from the perpetual rumination to the vibrant beauty unfolding around us. üåª

‚Ä¢ The Ripple Effect: Living in the moment doesn't only enrich our lives, it extends to those around us. By embracing the present, we radiate positive energy that can inspire others to join us on this beautiful journey of self-discovery. üåà

‚Ä¢ Freedom from Overthinking: Our minds are relentless machines, constantly toiling away, dissecting the past or projecting into the future. But what if we could free ourselves from this self-imposed mental prison and savor the tranquility of the present moment?üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

‚Ä¢ Appreciating the Simple Pleasures: When we live in the moment, we cultivate an innate sense of gratitude for the simple pleasures that often go unnoticed. That first sip of morning coffee, the silent embrace of a loved one, or the warmth of the sun caressing our skin‚Äîall become cherished experiences. ‚òïÔ∏è

‚Ä¢ Embracing Impermanence: Life is transient, my fellow souls. Nothing lasts forever. By living in the present, we acknowledge the fleeting nature of every experience and find solace in the ebb and flow of existence. üåä

I'll spend a lot of time out of the office with clients and vendors visiting properties, both luxury villas/boutique hotels and plots of land (jungle, scrub, plantations etc.)
My business partner has a distinct style, he mostly wears light fabric long sleeved button down paisley & floral shirts with jeans and suede shoes/ankle boots.

I come from edtech sales in Singapore and my ""uniform"" has been jeans, fitted black tee, blazer and boots.
I've always preferred black shirts as I tend to sweat quite a bit.
Jeans are ok as they are tough enough for when we go out to visit land and need to hike through brush, but they are warm and also a pain when we get caught in a downpour. I'm wondering if there are any more appropriate trousers options?
On top I was thinking of linen blend shirts as they should be cooler than straight cotton.

Right now I'm tempted to stick to jeans and a black tee with a linen jacket for when I'm in the office or air conditioned hotel coffee shop (pretty regular meeting venues for us) but see this as an opportunity to redefine my style.
I'm a big guy, around 95kgs muscular with broad shoulders but with a bit of extra body fat these days (dad bod) so a lot of the tropical styles don't really suit me as they seem to be good on skinny folks.

1iw2evt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1iw2evt/cmv_if_the_united_states_wants_to_raise_funds_it/,"CMV: If the United States Wants to Raise Funds, It Should Start by Taxing Religious Organizations, Namely Churches","The U.S. has a massive national debt and frequently debates how to raise revenue‚Äîwhether by increasing taxes on individuals, businesses, or the wealthy. But one major source of untapped funds is religious organizations, particularly churches, which collectively hold hundreds of billions of dollars in assets and generate billions in untaxed revenue each year.

Religious institutions currently benefit from 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, meaning they pay no federal income tax, property tax, or investment tax, and members can deduct donations to them. This is justified under the principle of separation of church and state, but I‚Äôd argue that exemption is outdated and unfair for several reasons:

1. Churches function like businesses. Many run multi-million-dollar enterprises, own vast real estate holdings, and operate profitable ventures (e.g., book sales, TV networks, investments). Yet, they are taxed less than the average small business. Why should a megachurch be tax-free while a struggling coffee shop pays full taxes?
2. Some churches engage in political activity. Under IRS rules, tax-exempt organizations must refrain from endorsing candidates, yet some churches routinely influence elections and policy. If they want to play politics, they should pay taxes like PACs do.
3. Fraud and lack of financial oversight. Unlike other nonprofits, churches do not have to disclose financial statements. This lack of transparency enables fraud, mismanagement, and wealth hoarding under the guise of religious exemption. Examples include televangelists living in mansions and pastors flying private jets.
4. Taxing churches would be a fairer way to raise revenue. Instead of increasing taxes on middle-class Americans or small businesses, taxing religious organizations could generate tens of billions annually, easing the burden on everyone else.

To be clear, I am not advocating taxing individual donations to religious causes, nor am I saying all churches are corrupt. But if a religious organization accumulates significant assets, engages in business-like activities, or influences politics, it should pay its fair share like any other entity.

However, I don't fully trust him yet because it was our first meeting. He's tried to ask me out on a second date a few times, but I've been making excuses because I realized our lifestyles are different now. He's working and I'd say he's financially stable based on his Instagram stories. He's always at fancy restaurants and travels a lot. So yeah, I feel like our lifestyles are really different right now since I'm still a student and don't have a job. It feels kind of unfair to him that he'd always be paying for things on our dates, and even if we do go on a second date, I don't know how to bring up this concern with him. I'm kind of embarrassed huhu, So help me, how should I talk to him about this, and what should I do?

Previous attempts: I can't bring this up through chat because we don't have deep conversations there. Our chats are just casual greetings and I'm only giving short replies",2,1740286384.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False
1iw2bd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iw2bd8/i_just_fought_my_dad/,I just fought my dad,"Hey Reddit, today is my first time using Reddit, but I‚Äôve been reading some articles about my situation, so I figured y‚Äôall could help me out. 

Anyways, my dad and I fought for a dumb reason that I know could‚Äôve been avoided. I was getting frustrated because I was searching for a guitar pick, but it was nowhere to be found. I ended up searching in my dad‚Äôs closet where he keeps his stuff, but he got mad at me and started cussing me out for doing so. I told him it‚Äôs not really a big deal, but he just kept cussing at me. Eventually, I got more and more pissed off, and I lost control, telling him that he‚Äôs messed up in the head, which made him even angrier. 

After that, I took off to the bathroom to cool off, but he followed me over and wouldn‚Äôt stop cussing at me. I told him to fuck off, and he decided to give me a body shot, which hurt really bad. So, I pushed him away, and he ended up choking me and holding me against the wall. Even after all of that, I kept pushing him away, but he wouldn‚Äôt stop until my mama interfered. 

My mama and dad started arguing over it, and dad kept saying, ""If you defend him, he‚Äôs just going to end up like the kid next door who‚Äôs nothing compared to me."" I decided to go to my room to cool off and play on my Xbox, but my mama kept yelling at me, and I told her to shut up. My dad came into my room and took my Xbox. I told him, ""Bro, I‚Äôm not even doing anything to you."" I told him he was crazy, and I guess he got pissed and smashed my Xbox to the ground. I lost it and pushed him hard, causing him to hit his mouth on the coffee table. He charged at me, and I was ready to take him on, but my mama was in the middle to prevent anything from happening. 

I was so pissed that he did that, so I got personal and told him, ""That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre an alcoholic, and you went to jail."" It ended there, and I‚Äôm starting to regret what I said and did because, again, I could‚Äôve prevented it all if I had kept my cool, but it happened. I just wanted to know if y‚Äôall could help me out and give me some tips on how to recover from this because, at the end of the day, he‚Äôs my dad, and I appreciate everything he does for me. 
Thanks, anything will help.

The desert air was cool, and most of the students had already gone to bed. But in the faculty lounge, Sensei sat alone, a cup of instant coffee in hand and his laptop open to a familiar sight: the Blue Archive Discord server.

‚ÄúAlright, guys, listen up.‚Äù His voice came through crisp and clear in the late-night voice chat. ‚ÄúWe need to talk about something serious. Something that‚Äôs been on my mind for a while.‚Äù

A few of the usual suspects‚ÄîKivotos enjoyers, Abydos simps, and at least one guy with a Hoshino profile picture‚Äîwere gathered in the chat.

‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù one of them encouraged.

Sensei leaned forward, glancing over his shoulder to make sure no one was around. ‚ÄúHoshino is‚Äîlisten, she‚Äôs just ridiculously erotic. I mean, come on. The lazy, sleepy-eyed look? The way her oversized jacket slides off her shoulders just a bit? How she‚Äôs always stretching and yawning like she just rolled out of bed? It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs naturally radiating a sleepy, effortlessly sexy vibe!‚Äù

The VC exploded in agreement.

‚ÄúFACTS.‚Äù
‚ÄúBro, you‚Äôre just saying what we‚Äôre all thinking.‚Äù
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs literally peak comfy gf energy.‚Äù
‚ÄúDO NOT LET HER HEAR THIS.‚Äù

Sensei chuckled, unaware of his impending doom. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt even get me started on her swimsuit. The way it clings to her curves? It‚Äôs unreal. She doesn‚Äôt even try to be seductive, but that somehow makes her even more dangerous.‚Äù

A sudden chill ran down his spine.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Sensei.‚Äù

The voice didn‚Äôt come from the VC.

Slowly, he turned around.

Standing in the doorway, her signature shotgun slung over her shoulder, was Takanashi Hoshino.

She stared at him with a half-lidded gaze, her expression unreadable.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Hoshino,‚Äù he croaked, his soul already leaving his body.

She blinked slowly. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So that‚Äôs what you think of me, huh?‚Äù

Sensei scrambled for excuses. ‚ÄúI-I was just‚Äîuh, you see, it‚Äôs not what it sounds like‚Äî!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, no, I think it‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like,‚Äù she cut him off, stepping closer. The guys in the VC had gone completely silent, watching in horror and fascination. ‚ÄúI was just coming in to grab a snack, but imagine my surprise when I hear my own Sensei talking about how erotic I am to the entire world.‚Äù

Sensei‚Äôs brain was in emergency shutdown mode. ‚ÄúUhhh‚Äî‚Äù

Hoshino sighed, rubbing her temple. ‚ÄúYou know what? I‚Äôm too tired for this.‚Äù She pulled out her phone, and Sensei‚Äôs heart leapt into his throat as he saw the unmistakable ‚ÄòRecording Started‚Äô notification flash on the screen.

‚ÄúNo‚ÄîHoshino‚Äîlisten, we can talk about this‚Äî‚Äù

She smirked. ‚ÄúNah, I think I‚Äôll just let everyone talk about this instead.‚Äù She tapped her phone. ‚ÄúThis is going straight to the Abydos group chat.‚Äù

Sensei let out a sound that was somewhere between a dying scream and a Windows XP shutdown noise.

Meanwhile, the VC erupted:

‚ÄúOH NO.‚Äù
‚ÄúHE‚ÄôS SO DONE.‚Äù
‚ÄúIT WAS NICE KNOWING YOU, SENSEI.‚Äù
‚ÄúABYDOS SC CAMPSITE VC WHEN?‚Äù

Hoshino turned to leave but paused in the doorway. She glanced back, her lazy smile somehow even more dangerous.

‚Äú‚Ä¶I will be getting some kind of compensation for this mental damage, by the way. Be prepared.‚Äù

And with that, she walked away, leaving Sensei to drown in his own shame as the VC filled with uncontrollable laughter.

-# THE NEXT MORNING 

Sensei sat in his office, staring blankly at his phone screen. The recording of his erotic ramblings about Hoshino had been dropped in the chat, and now all of Abydos knew the depths of his degeneracy.

But the worst part wasn‚Äôt even that.

It was Hoshino.

She had said she‚Äôd demand ‚Äúcompensation‚Äù for the mental damage he caused, but what exactly did she mean?

That question was answered the moment his office door creaked open.

Hoshino walked in, as lazy and relaxed as ever, her oversized jacket hanging off one shoulder. She let the silence stretch as she shut the door behind her, locking it with a casual flick of her fingers.

‚Äú‚Ä¶S-Sorry,‚Äù Sensei started, already sweating. ‚ÄúI‚Äîuh‚ÄîI don‚Äôt suppose you‚Äôre feeling merciful?‚Äù

She tilted her head, smirking. ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

His heart pounded. ‚ÄúW-What do you want?‚Äù

Hoshino yawned, stepping closer. ‚ÄúY‚Äôknow, Sensei‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been thinking.‚Äù

‚ÄúThinking?‚Äù

She leaned down, bracing her hands on his desk, bringing her face dangerously close to his. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kinda unfair, don‚Äôt you think? You get to say all these embarrassing things about me, but what do I get?‚Äù

‚ÄúI-I can make it up to you, I swear‚Äî‚Äù

She smirked. ‚ÄúOh, you will.‚Äù

Before he could react, she lifted her phone and deleted the recording.

Sensei blinked. ‚ÄúH-Hoshino‚Ä¶?‚Äù

She tapped her chin. ‚ÄúI was going to blackmail you with it, but I figured‚Ä¶ nah. That‚Äôs too much effort.‚Äù

He exhaled in relief. ‚ÄúOh, thank God‚Äî‚Äù

Then she straddled his lap.

‚ÄúWait‚ÄîHOSHINO‚Äî‚Äù

Her lazy smirk widened as she leaned in, their noses almost touching. ‚ÄúYou really like me that much, huh, Sensei?‚Äù

His brain short-circuited.

Her hands slid up to cup his face, her thumbs tracing over his cheeks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cute.‚Äù

‚ÄúH-Hoshino, hold on, we can talk about‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúShhh.‚Äù She rested her forehead against his. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really mind, y‚Äôknow. You think I‚Äôm erotic?‚Äù She giggled. ‚ÄúI guess that means you won‚Äôt mind if I make you mine.‚Äù

Sensei‚Äôs survival instincts screamed at him to run, but his body betrayed him. His hands instinctively found her waist, and her warm breath tickled his skin.

‚ÄúFrom now on,‚Äù she murmured, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my Sensei. Got it?‚Äù

He gulped. ‚ÄúA-Abydos is gonna kill me‚Ä¶‚Äù

She hummed, nuzzling against him like a cat. ‚ÄúNah. They already knew I had dibs.‚Äù

And with that, she sealed his fate.",6,1740286315.0,SenseisKitchen,0,0.88,False

I have a coworker who‚Äôs been at the hotel at least 3 years. She‚Äôs been in hospitality for 20, and she used to be an AGM. But now she‚Äôs adamantly content with just being a front desk agent and not having any managerial position. 

AND YET‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

In our communications log, you can scroll through and see ALL CAPS POSTS from her complaining about small things we may have forgotten during our shift, and how ‚Äúthis is my last time saying this!‚Äù and ‚Äúgoing forward, this doesn‚Äôt need to happen anymore!‚Äù

For more context, she usually works the 3-11 shift. I was recently made the primary 7-3 shift person because I‚Äôm organized, I ask very few questions, and I‚Äôm pretty good at problem solving. My main goal on the morning shift is to get all the incoming reservations ready for check-in. This would include checking out all the rooms, communicating with housekeeping and maintenance to see which rooms are ready to sell, getting all the key cards programmed for guests, and making sure there are enough supplies at the desk to get through the shift. This can be a lot during the morning shift, but I make sure all that gets done before anything else. 

Her complaints are almost always about how the coffee station wasn‚Äôt FULLY stocked, or trash wasn‚Äôt taken out, or the drawer wasn‚Äôt counted. While I do try to make sure everything is taken care of, sometimes I forget a thing or two. But to me, none of these things she‚Äôs complaining about impact the guest check-in. They are very much things she can take care of during her shift. 

There have been times where we‚Äôve had each other‚Äôs shifts (her in the morning and me in the evening). And literally every time I‚Äôve relieved her, the desk looks a mess. She‚Äôs scrambling trying to get rooms from housekeeping, the keys are almost never made, so I have to spend most of my shift picking up her slack. None of the billing is ever set up correctly on her shifts either, and that‚Äôs been a headache for everyone, yet NO ONE COMPLAINS. I‚Äôve even heard her say ‚Äúyou need a lot of patience for this morning shift, and I can‚Äôt wait to go back to my evening shift!‚Äù But she expects everyone else to be perfect. 

I got off earlier today at 3:00 and I was exhausted. During my shift, I had a guest make a new reservation to stay over. It was a 3rd party reservation, and my intent was to copy over the information from her previous reservation to the new one since it didn‚Äôt carry over. I had left a note about needing a card on file for incidentals, but forgot to copy the info over. 

This evening, I got a message in our group chat. It was a printout of the guests reservation missing the contact info. My coworker had written my name at the bottom with the words ‚ÄúTHIS IS UNACCEPTABLE‚Äù. Then she followed it up with ‚Äúper our boss, all the contact info must be on the reservation‚Äù. Keep in mind, my manager is in the group chat and hasn‚Äôt said a word to me, either in or out of the group chat. 

We do the same job, bro. She may have been doing it longer, but that doesn‚Äôt make her my boss or anyone‚Äôs boss. 

I‚Äôll just keep this in mind when I start my Director of Sales position next month. I can‚Äôt wait to tell her what‚Äôs ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù üòå",28,1740285998.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,9,0.97,False

I got Butterfingers. üôÑüôÑüôÑ Remember my username, because I will be posting my outfits that will contain products from SHEIN, and no, I won‚Äôt feel bad, and it doesn‚Äôt matter if you guys decide to downvote me, I‚Äôm not gonna let you guys bully newcomers and put them in a box, or tell them how to spend their money.

Let‚Äôs get one thing straight: gyaru fashion has always been fast fashion. J-fashion in general has heavily relied on fast fashion because it was designed for teens and young adults, not luxury collectors. Brands like CO&LU, COCOLULU, Liz Lisa, Ank Rouge, and Cecil McBee‚Äîall key players in gyaru history‚Äîwere fast fashion brands. They thrived on affordability, trend cycles, and accessibility, just like today‚Äôs fast fashion.

Yet, for some reason, it‚Äôs mainly Western gyarus who are shaming newcomers for buying from modern fast fashion brands. This isn‚Äôt even a widespread issue in Japan, where gyaru culture originated. It‚Äôs frustrating to see people who are trying to break into the subculture be shut down just because they can‚Äôt fit into or even find 20-year-old deadstock pieces. Not everyone has access to secondhand Japanese marketplaces or the budget to hunt for rare items.

And let‚Äôs be real‚Äîmost of the clothing people buy, regardless of subculture, is made under unethical conditions. If you own:
	‚Ä¢	A smartphone (made with cobalt mined by child labor)
	‚Ä¢	Chocolate (major brands like Nestl√© have been linked to child labor in cocoa farms)
	‚Ä¢	Coffee (many major brands source from plantations with forced labor)
	‚Ä¢	Fast food (many supply chains have been tied to exploitative labor practices)

Then congratulations, you‚Äôre already supporting unethical labor. Singling out newcomers for buying modern fast fashion while ignoring the broader reality of global consumerism is hypocritical.

Gatekeeping doesn‚Äôt make you a better gyaru‚Äîit just discourages new people from joining. Instead of tearing others down, how about celebrating that gyaru is still alive and evolving? 


And no, just because you need a phone for every day life, doesn‚Äôt negate the fact that it is a product of child labor lol. You don‚Äôt get a pass because you need it lol, people need clothes, and they still shop at H&M, which is another place that has forced labor allegations. 

Y‚Äôall are not going to ever convince me that this weird gatekeeping, moral grandstanding circle jerk that you have going on is something to be proud of. If someone wants to shop at a fast fashion boutique, they should feel that they can do whatever they want with their money. This is literally a non-issue in Japan, and no it‚Äôs not because they have brick and mortar stores there all the time, it‚Äôs because no one has this much time to worry about somebody else‚Äôs pockets and somebody else‚Äôs closet lol. If you see something cute on SHEIN and you wanna buy it, feel free to buy it. This fashion was originally built off the back of fast fashion, and do not let some self absorbed loser scare you away from a style that you love because you might not have the financial stability to make it yourself or the ability to thrift. In the real world, no one is going to stop and ask you where your outfit is, and then judge your whole personality off of that. Those people are called weirdos and bullies. I really don‚Äôt care if some faceless person on the Internet is upset at me because I brought a cute miniskirt off of a fast fashion site, and you shouldn‚Äôt be either. People will drag Shein, but give places like H&M, Apple, and Fashion Nova a pass, it‚Äôs sick. Understand that people are gonna always try to find a way to look down on you, don‚Äôt let them.",0,1740285522.0,actualgyaru,13,0.49,False

I've never made a post on here so I'm not too sure what to do but I'm pretty desperate for some advice so here we go.

I (16 F) have had feeling of love to my drama teacher (late 40s M) for about four years now. So I know I love him, but as I grew up with emotionally absent/abusive parents I don't know if I see him as a father figure or something else. He's a lovely guy, so unbelievably sweet and he just gets me, he's been there for me through everything, breaking up with my manipulative boyfriend, helping though problems with my parents, even just day to day chats about music, films, and life in general. He even knows my coffee order and drives me home sometimes, I wish he was my dad and I wish he was my friend. 

Now, I'm just stuck, I know things won't go any further and I don't want them to either. I just want to be loved but I know it's unhealthy to rely upon people to be your comfort like that. 

So for advice, what do you think I should do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated

There was one kid one year who thought I didn't like him for no justifiable reason, so there were these times where he would act up to see if I would kick him out for it, which he more or less admitted to later.  Of course I did not.  He didn't fight about it though after he pushed too far and I grounded him, because it seemed like he was kind of waiting for it and misbehaved on purpose hoping that I would just punish him without trying to kick him out. 

Other times, kids would deliberately not follow certain safety rules because they were mad at me or they thought certain rules were unfair and wanted to see how far they could bend them before I put my foot down or punished them.  Often, if they were upset about something, such as something I said that they misinterpreted, took too personally such as telling them I wasn't pleased with their recent grades meant I didn't want them here anymore, or just when they didn't get their way. 

I was a single dad host parent and would look forward to our vacations, going shopping and out to eat together, making them happy, supporting them, but there were many nights also in bed with pain and tears with all the hurt I felt about them thinking they had to test me instead of talking to me and that they actually questioned if my love and care for them and their happiness and well being was genuine or not. 

Most of the students just didn't work out, but by their choice, not mine.  It was typically them not being willing to adjust or found they had a friend with parents willing to host and a bigger house and family was too appealing for them to pass up on.  I did double hosting and the years where both students left, one of the students only left because the first one left and didn't want to be without a sibling. 

The part that upsets me the most is that I always made myself open to them to talk to, and even invited them out for coffee or something so they could tell me what's on their mind when they were feeling down lately, and somehow they didn't feel they could talk to me directly, but I had to hear they were sad and depressed from other people they told.

So, I (29F) have a sister, Rachel (31F), who‚Äôs getting married next month. I‚Äôve always been close to Rachel, but we‚Äôve had our fair share of issues, mostly because of her controlling nature. She‚Äôs always been the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù one, and I‚Äôve always been the one who gets overlooked or dismissed. But for the most part, I‚Äôve tried to support her‚Äîuntil now.

Here‚Äôs where the drama started: Rachel and I were out for coffee a few weeks ago, and she brought up her wedding plans. She was talking about her bridal party, and then she mentioned that she didn‚Äôt want my fianc√© (Jake, 32M) to be at the wedding at all.

I was shocked. I asked her why, and she said, ‚ÄúWell, he just doesn‚Äôt fit the vibe of the wedding. He‚Äôs not the type of person I want around at such an important event.‚Äù

I thought she was joking at first, but when I realized she wasn‚Äôt, I asked her to explain. She went on to say that Jake was ‚Äútoo loud,‚Äù ‚Äútoo casual,‚Äù and ‚Äúnot classy enough‚Äù for her wedding. I was furious. Jake and I have been together for five years, and I‚Äôve never once felt that he was anything less than amazing.

I told her that if Jake wasn‚Äôt welcome, then I wouldn‚Äôt be either. She tried to backpedal, saying I was overreacting, but it felt like she was just trying to make me choose between her and my fianc√©. I refused to back down.

Now, the entire family is upset with me. Rachel is accusing me of being selfish, and my parents are saying I should just ""let it go"" because it's her special day. But I feel like this is a huge disrespect to Jake and to me.

(Get new donor bonus money) Use the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! I will educate you about plasma. Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

In a quaint coffee shop you stumbled,¬†

Tumbling, bumbling into the plush armchair I habitually sat in,¬†

Your stuttered apologies a beacon bright into my existential grey.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

Unenthused patrons shot from all angles aimed a sniper‚Äôs shot glare,¬†

But within the¬†depths of my rib-cage, the ticking clock in my chest,¬†

Began to thrum along anomalously, a loud, enthralling tune,¬†

My book inked with printer‚Äôs colour, blinded by light too bright to bare.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

Beneath your halo‚Äôs glow, unflattering shadow made of me an uninspired fool,¬†

Hanging on to every apologetic syllable you struggled to utter,¬†

Muttering and stuttering, a harsh contrast to my heavy, unmoving tongue,¬†

But when our eyes did meet, deep-layered emotions swam languidly in your pools.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

But to the temple of this epiphanous occasion, my offerings at the alter were stones,¬†

Too star-struck to return your precious rambles with more than a lame agreeance but,¬†

your sweet titter grasped the pen to intertwine our stories in fate‚Äôs lock-bound book,¬†

 In warbled birdsong, your decree bound promise‚Äôs¬†golden tendrils around my bones. ¬†

¬†¬†

Treacherous ocean‚Äôs tides once threatened to capsize life‚Äôs swift sail-boat,¬†

I now found myself steering¬†calm waters, your presence a guiding compass, ¬†

Where cupid‚Äôs bow had so thoroughly missed its intended target,¬†¬†

Love‚Äôs true arrow pierced my chest, wound‚Äôs painless bleeding affection‚Äôs oath.¬†

¬†

¬†I had all but¬†cast aside any fleeting, wind-kissed threads of hope¬†

Dandelion‚Äôs seeds the memories of hurt in summer‚Äôs wispy breeze,¬†

Poisoning fertile soil so fledgling romance could not take root,¬†

Weary farmhands in barren¬†fields answering to loneliness‚Äô cruel crow.¬†

¬†

¬†

For intimacy‚Äôs darkest mould had infected my breathing lungs,¬†

and housing a tender heart had left my ribs barbed and flesh bruised,¬†

And in time‚Äôs ruthless tides, I‚Äôd struggled to keep my ailing wounds clean,¬†

No antiseptic is scar-proof, and on tender flesh the bitter liquid stung. ¬†

¬†¬†

A knight‚Äôs lance expertly parried, target forming this vessel‚Äôs deepest tear, ¬†

But, when stitches split, open sores soothed by your velvet skin, soft satin strokes,¬†

As the scars and scrapes lining my unsightly soma were embraced by delicate hands,¬†

Setting alight the whispering, ephemeral sparks that sung sweetly in summer‚Äôs air. ¬†

¬†¬†

Tribulations of time serve to swallow even the most ebullient flame,¬†

Everyday life a bricklayer, piling row upon row of concrete worries and woe,¬†¬†

Slowly suffocating fierce fires, a lust for life doused in monotony‚Äôs unkempt downpour,¬†

Like a star, I burned ever brighter, a beacon piercing a darkened, velvet curtain of pain.¬†

¬†¬†

From first outing, electricity charged both poles in symbiotic connection,¬†

I believed¬†I must be a poseable doll, to play with my heart and body as a cruel instrument,¬†

But we fit as a perfect puzzle, where hard and soft embraced piece edge and corner. ¬†

As buzzing affection dropped pollen baubles, bringing to blossom deep-seeded affection.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

As a gardener, you‚Äôd sewed seeds and prepped soil and under your brilliant sky,¬†

I unfurled my stem, tentative bud nurtured through storm, through shine,¬†

Carefully pruning the past‚Äôs crimson thorns, indented¬†sharply in porcelain dermis,¬†

As my wilted petals slowly turned towards your sun and bid winter‚Äôs frost goodbye.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

In your letters, dove‚Äôs wings beat to the rhythm of silky stanzas interwoven with promise,¬†

I¬†swear I shall treasure this solemn covenant, gospel proclaimed through cracked lips,¬†¬†

Gentle prayers a thrumming pulse along every tender nerve, religion‚Äôs binding creed,¬†

Cemented in church‚Äôs stained-glass window, fractured colour capturing a delicate kiss.¬†¬†

¬†

Softened, dusky eyes, the gravity grounding my swirling, restless sea of blue,¬†¬†

Contrasting figures lazily basking in comfortable silence, echoing across the brightest night,¬†

River‚Äôs reflection a kind portrait painted by rippled brushstrokes of whispering water-reeds,¬†

As the stars glistened amongst the sea of evening, upon the sight of us two.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

So with these words, my dear, I believe it is time,¬†

To speak true intentions, through sickness and through health¬†

And unto whatever end, under God‚Äôs watchful eye,¬†¬†

I say I do, as your newly-wed wife.¬†¬†

This session gave me a clearer and honest picture. Thomas talked about connecting to the farmers on a grass root level, learning about their plights and how very likely that as consumers, we can easily detach ourselves to the plight of the poor farmers in Brazil and Africa. Though Philippine is still making its way to really high specialty grade, and green bean prices are relatively more expensive, the idea of lowballing our fellow country men farmers isn‚Äôt the way to go. If a German cares so much for our fellow country men, shouldn‚Äôt we more than anyone else?

Kayo then talked about how the global pricing in general is broken. Something dictated by the people in New York and London. Why is that so? Partly because we let them is his argument. 

Gio talked about increasing the pie instead of eating up on each others‚Äô market. Also how modern technology like AI can help make sense of data and help us make more informed decisions as coffee professionals (roasters, cafe owners) and even as consumers. ",3,1740284947.0,chaiph,0,0.81,False

36 year old man that suspects I have gastritis. In 2018 I began a new, stressful, very physical job that requires me to lift/lower and walk constantly. Began getting a lava like, itching, spasm, burning pain under left rib after eating that would radiate to back. It was excruciating, and my lifestyle likely contributed (smoking, partying, NSAIDS, extremely spicy foods etc.) 

Did the ultrasound in 2019 and endoscopy which were normal minus mild inflammation in esophagus. Suffered for another couple years and eventually kicked 90% sugar from diet, including my daily coke and snickers lol). The burning subsided and life went on with my usual Gastro issues like IBS (diarrhea and malabsorbed stools) and I learned to just live with it. I would occasionally still get the GERD like reflux and burning throat. 

Popped tums and this all kind of quieted down until last February. Started getting early satiety and vomited after eating breakfast one morning and ran off to ER for a battery of tests. They did CT scan with contrast and blood work which came back normal minus mild colitis and stomach irritation.

Got better and life continued until new symptoms arose in December. Began getting a new burning type pinching pain off/on throughout day under left rib and occasionally burning and stabbing in left flank. During this time I have been consuming more coffee and still smoke and use NSAIDS on occasion.
Tried zinc Carnosine irregularly because I believe it has caused me nausea and now I‚Äôm dropping a few pounds. 

My health anxiety is in full overdrive and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm dying of some type of terminal cancer.
I still have an appetite and ate a ton of unhealthy food yesterday only to shit my brains out today!
My PCP Friday told me he would check my blood and let me know, but doesn‚Äôt think a repeat CT scan is necessary at the moment.

So I‚Äôm debating here if I should go to ER to see if I can get another scan to hopefully put my mind at ease, but gastritis sufferers of Reddit, does this sound like something you have experienced?
If so, being a thin guy already, what should I eat to maintain my normal weight? I‚Äôm shooting for 2800 calories a day.

Thank-you so much if you‚Äôve made it this far and for your time. I‚Äôm worried sick.",1,1740284804.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

I try to handle things on my own, but I‚Äôll be real‚Äîlife is just better when you‚Äôve got good people to share it with. So I‚Äôm posting here to find people to meet and get to know. 

About me: I‚Äôm 32, born and raised in OC, and lately, I‚Äôve been doing a lot of things solo‚Äîgrabbing a beer, catching a movie, going on runs, and hanging out at coffee shops. But you know what? It‚Äôd be nice to have some company. It‚Äôd be nice to get to know new people. I‚Äôm not seeking anything romantic atm, just cool people to chat with, clink glasses, and maybe play a few games/board games.¬†

So, if you‚Äôre also tired of scrolling Reddit alone and want to meet up for a beer or some food at Radiant Brewery in Anaheim tomorrow around 4pm, hit me up. Worst case? We share an awkward drink and part ways. Best case? We make a solid connection and have a new go-to hangout. Who's in? ",13,1740284754.0,30sinOC,11,1.0,False

What else should we get to really get into the coffee game, please recommend reasonable items, like I saw a $250 bean scale and was like wtf. Anyways, I heard these two machines were a great combo, but I just want to make sure we have everything to have fun, and make some great shots. Any advice on tampers, whiskers, scales, etc. would be greatly appreciated :)",1,1740284743.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I also just received decants for Lattafa Khamrah & Qahwa and I prefer Qahwa a bit because of the coffee as well as Maison Alhambra Jean Lowe clone lineup - VIBE, AZURE, FRAICHE & NOIR. I am not sure of what to comment on those.

She was frustrated that she was making very little sales. The chat led to me reviewing her shopping cart and to be honest, it looked like everyone else's.

I asked her why she picked her products, and she said that she liked them and thought they would sell well.

I then asked if she cared what the products she offered were as long as they were selling. She replied, ""Nope if I'm making sales, I don't care what they are"". 

I then said If I ask you to post 3 new products to sell and tell you where you can sell them, would you promise to do that? She said, ""Yes"".

Within a couple of days, she uploaded 10 new designs, and she visited the group I told her to. I sent her a very simple script to use as a conversation opener, and within a week she was making sales almost every day.

What Did I Do? I instructed her to find a group of people who were crazy about a niche topic. I'll use Humorous Coffee Memes on cups and t-shirts. 

It's so much easier you find a group of people who love this stuff, so your opportunity to sell designs that are appealing to them increases your chances of making sales.

BOTTOM LINE:  
Sell what people want, not what you like!

Very chill. Instead she asks if we can Facetime. I know this is, on paper, innocuous, but I think there is nothing more awkward nor ineffective than a virtual date to discover first impressions. It's one thing if it's a safety thing (though lets be real, a 12pm coffee at a popular bookstore is as careful as you can be), but if it's a vibe check thing, I'm honestly wanting to say that if you can't dedicate an hour of your time on a Sunday because of the risk that you might not have a spark with the person, then you aren't seriously trying to date.",57,1740284294.0,redscarepod,19,0.89,False
