Just wanted to share something cool from our shop this week. We had a [2019 Ferrari Portofino](https://www.autostyleppf.com/price) come in originally a sleek OEM grey and the owner wanted to turn it into the iconic Ferrari red without repainting. So we wrapped it in[ 3M Hot Rod Red Gloss](https://www.autostyleppf.com/), one of the boldest red vinyl colors you can get.

Why red? If you know Ferrari, you know red is part of the legend. A bright red supercar just hits different  at car meets, on the road, or parked at your favorite cars & coffee.

Vinyl wrapping is a game-changer for exotic cars. It gives owners freedom to switch up the look, *protect* the factory paint, and even boost resale by keeping that OEM color perfect underneath.

Some people think red is the only option for a Ferrari, but honestly, 3M has tons of killer colors people choose for luxury cars:

* [Satin Black](https://www.autostyleppf.com/wrap) for a mean stealth vibe
* **Gloss White Pearl** classy on Porsches
* **Matte Metallic Charcoal** super slick on McLarens
* **Gloss Bright Yellow** because you *should* stand out
* **Frozen Blue** looks insane under sunlight

We only use premium[ 3M vinyl because](https://www.autostyleppf.com/wrapschool) it‚Äôs easy to work with, looks like paint when installed right, and holds up for years. We stand by every install with a **3-year warranty**, plus the manufacturer‚Äôs warranty of **6‚Äì8 years** depending on the film.

When someone drops off a Ferrari, Lambo, or McLaren at our shop, it‚Äôs not just about the wrap  it‚Äôs about trust. They know we treat their cars like our own, with the same passion they have for driving them.

If you‚Äôre thinking about changing up your car‚Äôs color or just want to protect your paint and stand out, a high-quality wrap is 100% worth it.

Got any [wrap color ideas](https://www.autostyleppf.com/services) or questions about the process? Drop ‚Äòem below  always happy to talk wraps and supercars.

*If you‚Äôre near Chicago/Naperville/Sugar Grove, come say hi  we love seeing cool cars and new ideas roll through our shop.*

1ltdiaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1ltdiaj/my_own_sleepwork_schedule_is_all_over_the_place/,My own sleep/work schedule is all over the place. How can I give HIM a routine?,"We‚Äôve been struggling a bit with our 13 week old puppy when it comes to establishing a sleep routine that makes sense for everyone in the house.

We‚Äôve had him for only a week so I understand that it‚Äôs still early, but I‚Äôm worried the lack of consistency will make everything waaaay harder.

- Not only do I usually work early mornings/nights (anywhere from 1am-10am to 6am to 2pm), my schedule changes quite a bit, especially now with everyone taking summer vacations and the botton of the work seniority food chain having to fill in for everyone.


- My boyfriend works from home (his office is in the ¬´¬†cat territory / not accessible to dog yet¬†¬ª side of the apartment, so he can‚Äôt like watch the dog while he works. At least his hours are more flexible, but closer to 9-5.


- We‚Äôve been trying to go with crate training but face a couple of the usual hiccups. Puppy will sleep at night in his crate but naps are harder to do since he needs us in the room to stop whining. We also want to limit barking and whining because we live in an apartment so‚Ä¶ neighbors.


- During naps, and sometimes at night, I cave in and let him out of the crate to sleep on me, on the air mattress we put next to the crate. But even then, sometimes he wakes up and whines.


- So far we‚Äôve just been like, relaying eachother. A ¬´¬†typical¬†¬ª schedule could be something like : wake up at 8 with boyfriend while I‚Äôm at work. He takes him out to potty, feeds him, then puppy takes a nap on the couch while bf has a coffee. I get home at noon, take him potty. Nap in crate while I nap next to the crate for 2 hours. Potty, play for about an hour, then another nap in crate while I chill next to crate. Bf finishes work, dinner for all three of us, potty/walk, then I go to bed at around 8pm. Nap on sofa with bf watching tv, potty and play, another nap on sofa from 11pm to 1am. Then I GET UP, bf goes to bed and pup goes to crate. No accidents in crate so far, btw, he can easily hold it in for like 7 hours.


- I‚Äôm starting to suspect all those sofa naps aren‚Äôt helping, so I got a SECOND crate I‚Äôm gonna set up in the living room so he can nap while we chill in that room. I‚Äôm just really, really anticipating a lot of barking and whining. Should we just like.. put him in there and let him whine? I thought the goal was to make the crate super welcoming. He‚Äôll even go willingly in the bedroom crate (all meals fed there, and it‚Äôs the only place he gets the PB kong) but as soon as I close the door it‚Äôs whine and bark. 


Please tell me what I can do better. I‚Äôm already taking as much time off as I can, but honestly I didn‚Äôt think the whole sleep schedule thing through. It‚Äôs been a week and my bf and I are both exhausted and cranky (yet madly in love with our puppy).",1,1751839661.0,puppy101,1,1.0,False
1ltdg4z,https://i.redd.it/h2bjlnl9ubbf1.jpeg,Miele CVA 6805 - not brewing,"Hi Reddit community,

I have a Miele CVA 6805 Graphite grey built-in purchased in around 2020. We maintained the machine per the manufacturer guidelines, descaling and degreasing as prompted using official Miele cleaning tablets.

It is now inoperable for coffee although the hot water bypass mechanism seems to still work. Just fails to make it through brewhead.

The decades long local technician for my area of the PNW has tried  a number of things which have not worked. He is a very competent engineer who has been with Miele for ages. This machine appears to be an anomaly. He basically said that there is nothing left for him to try.

Miele will not help! I requested support twice. Twice they closed my case, unwilling to offer any additional support or assistance. These machines are definitely not supposed to die in as little as five years.

So far here are all the things replaced on this machine:
‚Ä¢ Brewhead (twice)
‚Ä¢ Drainage valve (twice)
‚Ä¢ Complete motor assembly/unit for moving through the brewhead positions
‚Ä¢ Hot water coffee pump 
‚Ä¢ some other little fittings I believe 

In addition he tested that water moved from the pump. First straight out, then after heater, and I think then after switch? I mentioned the ceramic switch as a potential issue but he didn‚Äôt believe that was possible. 

Is there anyone with some additional advice for how I might resurrect my machine? It is a significant piece of technology and coffee goodness that I just can‚Äôt believe is not repairable.

Thanks.

1ltddgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ltddgs/aita_for_not_wanting_to_meet_up_with_my_daughters/,"AITA for not wanting to meet up with my daughter‚Äôs childhood bully, even though she‚Äôs now my (adult) student and wants to reconnect?","Years ago, when my daughter (8F at the time) was in second grade in our birth country, she had a classmate (also 8F) who bullied her. This girl would pull my daughter‚Äôs hair, boss her around, and pressure her to do dangerous things or make her feel inferior. My daughter was quiet, looked different from most kids (blonde, fair-skinned), and was often targeted.

We spoke to the school, but they didn‚Äôt do much, either her mom, so we ended up switching schools. Unfortunately, there were other bullying incidents even there. Eventually, we moved to Canada, and my daughter thrived, she made friends (some were mean too but not that mean) and graduated high school doing well.

Fast forward many years. I‚Äôm now in postgrad education, and some of my students are international. One of them turned out to be that same girl, now 21F. She was my student this semester and, honestly, a good one. She was respectful, spoke to me kindly in our native language, and even asked at the end of the semester if my daughter (also now 21) and I wanted to meet her for coffee.

She is new in the country, she married young but I don't thinkg she has friends in here, if that information is helpful.

I asked my daughter, and she immediately said, ‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù She remembers the bullying very clearly and wants nothing to do with her.

I feel bad, the girl seems like she‚Äôs changed, and part of me wonders if she wanted to reconnect as a way to apologize or make amends. But I also want to respect my daughter‚Äôs feelings and not put her in an uncomfortable situation. I told the student that I live two hours away now and it would be hard, but I‚Äôd let her know.

What a pleasant meal this was! The crackers were actually fully edible and not stale or rancid at all! My 1st time experiencing that and it really made all the difference!

Pics 1-3 show packaging and contents

Pics 4-5 show the zucchini caviar and some of the crackers. This stuff is pretty delightful and not offensive in any way. The crackers were perfectly crisp and quite hearty. Together, this is a filling snack or small meal.

Pics 6-8 show the buckwheat with beef porridge.   I fry these style of dishes when I get them and like to generate crispy bits for sure. I also add black pepper and cayenne for some heat and flavor boost. These dishes have a lot of fat, so I also use a paper towel to suck some of that up as I am watching my calories closely. As always, a single ration is more like a full day for me. The texture on this dish was perfect. Beef pieces are very small but plentiful. Did the zucchini caviar add anything to this dish, maybe? That would really be up to you, I liked it with a small amount but would not mix the whole can in or anything. Crackers would make this even more hearty!

Pic 9 shows the wonderful Russian apple jam on a cracker. No complaints on this at all. Think Apple butter,  great flavor, sweet, very satisfying!

Pic 10 is showing a wet wipe. Why, do u ask? Because I wanted to basically!

In conclusion,  these are great little meals and I do suggest trying one, just pay attention to which menu you are ordering to ensure you get what you want.  There are a couple issues, lack of coffee and lack of a cold beverage base. The tea is a fine beverage and can technically be made hot or cold, but 24 hr Russian rations pretty much always come with a cold beverage base, and they can be quite good, so it's a bummer not to get one. 20 grams of sugar for a single tea is a bit overkill as well. I've seen folks add sugar to the buckwheat with beef, what do u all think, is that something you'd try?

Hopefully this is how he orders it, this was my second time at Dunkin so I don‚Äôt know if he meant something different but this is going word for word what he said.
The coffee is interesting, very bitter but blueberry adds a fruity taste that I wouldn‚Äôt associate with coffee normally. Almost like eating a blueberry muffin while having a black iced coffee. The donut helps as it is very sweet from all the powdered sugar, and despite being chocolate it still complements the fruity coffee.
Overall, the two items separately are okay but together make a nice combo. In conclusion, Jerma might actually be onto something

1. How often should we be going on dates?
2. What if the city you live in does not have people you vibe with? I‚Äôve had very shitty time with the apps finding ppl in my city. 
3. I rarely find anyone interesting enough on the apps to actually want to go out with them- conversation too dry or they just ask me to hook up.

The last time I went out on a date was probably 4 weeks ago and the date was soooooo boring. Before that it was some time in April maybe. We had a decent time but that guy ghosted me. 

When I say not a lot of ppl I vibe with, I‚Äôll give you an example of what I mean. I used to live in the Bay Area and I know there‚Äôs a lot of guys there. But the dates I went on were usually fun, hinge was very happening, I was able to connect with more guys, and the dates were more interesting. At the very least it would be a good conversation and exploring a fun spot. Here in the city I live in right now, first date is too dry, mostly coffee. And it‚Äôs the most boring conversation ever. Idk how it‚Äôs this boring. I‚Äôm rarely using hinge and even when I do, I get bored so fast that I just can‚Äôt. In the bay, I wasn‚Äôt using it that much, but even then, things used to be pretty happening and fun. Not sure if it‚Äôs just the city or what. I don‚Äôt think I can move any time soon either and the bay is way too expensive for me.

sometimes you can borrow from adjacent palettes (eg. muted summer looking good in some muted autumn shades) and although the blush swatch can appear ""warm"" on my arm in certain lightings (bc it's a brown blush) i don't think it's necessarily classified as a ""warm"" tone. if it's muted enough i feel like it can work for my olive complexion

They were wrong.,"In Indonesia, many mountains are known for their horror stories. Hikers get lost mysteriously. Spirits call out at night. Some say Mount Mxxx whispers to the living. Mount Lxxx has offerings piled at the summit. And everyone‚Äôs heard of the haunted trails of Mount Sxxx. But the mountain I chose? Mount Pxxx. Everyone said it was the safest. The most beginner-friendly. Not too tall, no dangerous cliffs, no real history of tragedy, and more importantly, no ghost stories. It‚Äôs a favorite for people doing their first mountain hike. And the only rule people remind you of? Don‚Äôt litter to keep the environment clean. I didn‚Äôt. I followed every rule.

  


The day I hiked was perfect. The sky was clear, the air was thin and cold, but fresh. Other hikers passed by me, smiling.

¬†

¬†

""*Cuacanya bagus banget, ya? Langitnya bersih.*‚Äù | ¬†‚ÄúThe weather‚Äôs perfect, isn‚Äôt it? Clear skies.‚Äù

¬†

¬†

I smiled and nodded in response.

¬†

¬†

I reached the summit just before sunrise, exhausted but satisfied. The world below was hidden beneath a sea of clouds, and the peaks that pierced through them caught the first golden light like ancient crowns. For a moment, it felt like standing in a dream. It was perfect. I took off my backpack and sat on a dry patch of grass, letting the cool breeze sting the sweat on my neck. My legs ached, but it felt good. I pulled out a thermos of lukewarm coffee and a soggy peanut butter sandwich, the kind that tastes like heaven when you‚Äôre above the clouds. Nearby, a group of friends took turns capturing slow-motion videos of themselves jumping, trying to get that perfect mid-air freeze with the clouds behind them. Not wanting to lose, I snapped a few photos of the sky, of my shoes against the edge, of the tent cluster below. One of them I even posted: ‚ÄúMade it to the top of Pxxx! Unreal view."" The signal was weak, but it went through.

  


After a while, I laid back on a flat rock, watching the sky turn from gold to soft blue. I closed my eyes for maybe a minute, just enough to feel the sun warm my face. The wind rustled the grass gently. I could still hear laughter, thermos lids popping open, someone playing soft music from a speaker.

  


But then something changed. The warmth of the sun vanished. Goosebumps rose on my arms. The air turned sharp and cold, too cold for this hour, for this weather. I sat up, confused, rubbing my arms. The sky still looked pale and bright, but the warmth was gone. It didn‚Äôt make sense. I reached for my backpack to grab a scarf. That‚Äôs when I realized I was alone. No laughter. No footsteps. No distant music. Just silence, heavy and wrong. Then, I noticed the fog. Not rolling in from afar like a weather shift. It was just... there. All around me. One moment, everything was clear. The next, the summit was gone. The sky, the trails, the campers, all vanished into thick white. I stood still, confused. Called out. No answer. Then, in the whiteness, a narrow side path emerged, one I hadn't seen before. It sloped downward between crooked trees that didn‚Äôt belong on Pxxx. I don‚Äôt know why I stepped onto it. Maybe because standing still felt more terrifying.

  


I walked for what felt like an hour, though I couldn't see the sun anymore. The fog never lifted, just hovered, thick, wet, clinging to my skin. My clothes were damp, and each step felt heavier than the last. The ground shifted beneath me, sometimes soft with moss, sometimes crunching with unseen twigs. I kept hearing faint sounds, whispers, the rustle of cloth, maybe even footsteps, but every time I stopped, there was nothing. And then, I saw them. People. That‚Äôs what I hope they are. Dozens. Dressed in traditional clothes such as *kebaya*, *lurik*, and *iket kepala*, as if they had just walked out of a 19th-century Javanese painting. Their outlines wavered in the mist like watercolors not yet dry. Their faces looked real, tired, and surprised. One of them, a middle-aged woman with a worn shawl, stopped and whispered to another while pointing at me. Her lips moved slowly, deliberately, as if the words themselves were heavy. Others followed her gaze. Everyone stared. They didn‚Äôt seem hostile, just startled. Their eyes flicked from my shoes to my backpack to my face, as if trying to make sense of me. Then a man stepped forward. He looked older than the rest, his back bent, his face creased like a dried leaf. His eyes were sharp, still, and didn‚Äôt blink much. He spoke:

¬†

¬†

""*Samp√©yan punika sinten? Nopo panjenengan saged mlebet mriki?*‚Äù | ""Who are you? How did you enter here?‚Äù

¬†

¬†

I stammered. ‚Äú*Maaf‚Ä¶ saya tidak mengerti.*‚Äù | ‚ÄúSorry‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

¬†

¬†

They looked even more puzzled.

¬†

¬†

Another man, this one younger, gestured for me to follow. He stepped lightly and didn‚Äôt make a sound as he walked. He led me to a small wooden hut nearby and smiled. The hut was old, its walls patched with mismatched wood and its roof sagging under damp leaves. He spoke too quickly and too formally for me to understand, but he waved me inside and pointed to the floor. I didn‚Äôt want to stay outside. So I went in. The smell of jasmine floated faintly at first, sweet, familiar, almost comforting. Before I could fully settle, the man looked at me and spoke gently, almost whispering:

¬†

¬†

""Samp√©yan ngaso mawon rumiyin, ben awak√© waras."" | ""You should rest for now, so your body recovers.""

¬†

¬†

I blinked, unsure what he meant. I didn‚Äôt understand most of it. He noticed my confusion, smiled softly, and then brought his hands together near his cheek, tilting his head, the gesture for sleep. I nodded hesitantly. Then he turned and walked out of the hut, closing the door behind him with a quiet thud. I laid down, trying to calm my breath. But I couldn‚Äôt sleep.

  


I didn't know for how long I closed my eyes, I then noticed the jasmine scent grow heavier‚Ä¶ and heavier‚Ä¶ until it pressed against my face like a wet cloth. Sweetness turned sour, then rancid. The air thickened, clinging to my throat. I could taste it now, something spoiled, metallic, crawling with decay. Then came the stench of rot. Not just dead meat, but meat that had been forgotten. I sat up, nauseous. My head spun. The walls seemed to pulse in the corners of my eyes. Something was wrong. Very wrong.

  


I stood. My instinct told me to run. I staggered toward the door, gagging on the air. And then he was there. Blocking the exit. No longer the young man who had guided me here. No longer human. His skin was dry and gray, flaking in patches like burnt paper. His eyes were sunken pits glowing blood-red, unblinking. From his mouth hung a swollen, blackened tongue that dragged against his chest like a wet rope. His lips had torn at the corners, splitting upward in an impossible grin. Inside, his teeth were jagged and yellow, each one a different size, each one meant to tear. He hissed, a sound like air escaping a cracked skull.

¬†

¬†

""*Panjenengan bot√™n dipun undang. Panjenengan kedah dipun korbanaken.*‚Äù | ""You are uninvited. You must be sacrificed.‚Äù

¬†

¬†

I didn‚Äôt think. I threw myself at him. He was colder than anything I‚Äôd ever touched, like stone soaked in ice water. His clawed hand scraped my side as I pushed through, the tips slicing skin. I fell into the mud outside, gasping, the fog swallowing me whole. But I didn‚Äôt stop. I ran. Out of the hut. Out of that place. Into the fog that felt safer than the thing behind me.

¬†

¬†

More of them chased me now. Their human faces were fading, skin melting into something pale and waxy. Their mouths stretched sideways, far past the edges of their cheeks, gaping with too many teeth. Eyes sunken deep, rimmed in black, some blinking sideways like lizards. Their arms grew longer with every step, fingers curling like claws, dragging against the ground. Bones cracked and popped as they moved, but they didn‚Äôt slow down. They hissed through broken teeth. Whispered words I couldn‚Äôt understand. Shrieked like animals being burned alive. They threw rocks. One scraped past my shoulder, another slammed into my back. One of them lunged and scratched my arm, tearing skin. Another got close and I felt its breath on my neck, hot and sour. It snapped at me, trying to bite. I screamed and grabbed the nearest branch, half-rotten, slick with moss. I swung wildly, hitting something soft, something that let out a scream that wasn‚Äôt human. I kept running. Bleeding. Slipping in the mud. I don‚Äôt know how long I ran. My legs gave out eventually. I collapsed in a clearing, lungs burning, heart pounding like it wanted to break free from my chest. And still, the fog was everywhere.

¬†

¬†

That‚Äôs when I saw him. An old man sitting beneath a twisted tree. Dressed in a black *beskap* and a *batik blangkon*. His face calm, dignified. His eyes... ancient. He watched me for a long time. Then he said:

¬†

¬†

""*Panjenengan ingkang kapisan mlebet mriki, mboten nat√© wonten sad√®r√®ngipun. Amargi punika, kula lan para tiyang mriki sangat ajrih menawi panjenengan badh√© ndhatengaken bebaya. Kula ajrih, para tiyang badh√© nyobi damel piala dhateng panjenengan.*"" | ""You are the first to enter here, no one from your world has been here before. That is why the people and I here are very afraid that you will bring danger. I am afraid that the people will try to harm you.‚Äù

¬†

¬†

""*Maaf Pak, saya tidak mengerti.*"" | ‚ÄúI am sorry, I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù I replied.

¬†

¬†

He nodded, then switched to Bahasa Indonesia:

¬†

¬†

‚Äú*Kamu bukan dari dunia ini. Kamu yang pertama masuk ke sini. Aku tidak tahu kenapa.*‚Äù | ""You are not from this world. You are the first to enter. I don't know why.‚Äù

¬†

¬†

‚Äú*Itulah sebabnya mereka marah padamu.*‚Äù | ""That‚Äôs why they are angry at you.‚Äù

¬†

¬†

‚Äú*Dunia ini tidak pernah dikunjungi oleh manusia dari tempatmu. Tidak seharusnya bisa. Tapi sepertinya sekarang sudah terbuka.*‚Äù | ""This realm was never visited by humans from your side. It shouldn't be possible. But seems like the door has opened.‚Äù

¬†

¬†

‚Äú*Sebaiknya kamu keluar‚Ä¶ sebelum terlambat.*‚Äù | ""You must leave... before it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù

¬†

¬†

I replied ‚Äú*Bagaimana caranya?*‚Äù | ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

¬†

¬†

He didn‚Äôt answer right away. His gaze dropped to the fog-covered ground, as if searching for something buried beneath it. The tree behind him creaked, though there was no wind. For a moment, I thought he wouldn‚Äôt speak again. Then, quietly, he said:

  


‚Äú*Mungkin‚Ä¶ satu-satunya cara untuk keluar‚Ä¶ adalah membiarkan orang lain menggantikanmu.*‚Äù | ""Maybe‚Ä¶ the only way out‚Ä¶ is to let someone else take your place.‚Äù His voice trembled, just slightly. He didn‚Äôt look at me when he said it. He seemed unsure. Not just uncertain, he was afraid of the answer himself.

¬†



‚Äú*Atau mungkin dengan pengorbanan... atau dengan menunggu kabut-nya menghilang.*‚Äù | ‚ÄúOr maybe through a sacrifice‚Ä¶ or waiting for the fog to clear. ‚Äù

  


He looked at me then. For the first time, I saw a flicker of pity in his ancient eyes.

  


‚Äú*Belum pernah ada yang seperti ini. Saya tidak tahu pasti. Tapi mereka akan mencarimu. Dan mereka tidak akan berhenti.*‚Äù | ‚ÄúThis has never happened before. I don‚Äôt know for sure. But they will come for you. And they won‚Äôt stop.‚Äù

¬†



He stood slowly, brushing invisible dust from his clothes. The fog around us shifted, almost pulling at him.

  


‚Äú*Aku akan mencoba menenangkan mereka‚Ä¶ setidaknya untuk sementara.*‚Äù | ‚ÄúI will try to calm them‚Ä¶ at least for a while.‚Äù His voice was low, heavy with doubt. Then he turned and walked away, his figure swallowed by the fog.

  


I contemplated his three options.

  


The first, trap someone else. The thought made my stomach twist. I didn‚Äôt want to do that. I couldn‚Äôt. But even if I did‚Ä¶ how long would I have to wait? Days? Weeks? Would someone even come? Would they take the same wrong step I did? What if no one ever showed up? What if I waited forever, with the fog pressing in and those things getting closer? It wasn‚Äôt a plan. It was a gamble with no guarantee.

  


The second, sacrifice. But what did that even mean? Sacrifice what? My life? A piece of me? The ""people"" here? And to whom? To the forest? To the fog? To the twisted things that whisper when the wind dies? Too many questions. Too much I didn‚Äôt understand. And I was running out of time to figure it out.

  


The last, wait until the fog clears. It sounded almost laughable. Wait? In this place? With them crawling through the mist, stretching their limbs, licking the air for my scent? What if the fog never clears? What if this is it‚Äîforever?

  


None of the choices felt like escape. Each one was just a slower way to die.

  


Before I made up my mind, I noticed those creatures were closing in. I could see that it was no longer just fear in their eyes, it was pure hatred. A need to erase me.

  


I crawled into a hollow tree, my breath shallow, my body trembling. Thorns tore into my arms as I hid inside a bush, curling into the mud like an animal. I bit down on my own hand to stop from crying out. The cold wrapped around me like a second skin. They passed close, so close I could smell the rot on their breath. The air warped with their presence. Some dragged their limbs, others twitched like puppets pulled by unseen strings.

  


The old man stood in their path. His arms were raised in ritual stillness, unmoving, like a statue carved from the mountain itself. A barrier. A prayer. They bowed to him, reluctantly. But I saw it in their faces. In their clenched jaws. In the twitch of their stretched fingers. Even he couldn‚Äôt hold them back much longer. His strength was a thread, and it was fraying.

¬†

¬†

I curled deeper into the hollow tree, holding my breath as the sounds of their footsteps faded. My body ached, scraped and bleeding, my heart pounding so loudly I was sure it would give me away. And then through a narrow slit in the bark I saw her. A figure moving through the fog. Bright red. A girl in a windbreaker, maybe in her twenties. A real living human. Blinking in confusion as she stepped into the warped forest, eyes darting from tree to tree like she already knew something was wrong. She looked disoriented, but untouched. Unharmed. Still fresh to this place. She didn‚Äôt belong here. Just like I didn‚Äôt.

  


And in that moment, something inside me cracked. This was it. This was the moment. The one the old man suggested. I didn‚Äôt want to do it. I wanted to scream for her to run. But my mouth opened and the words that came out were a call. A wave. A lie dressed as hope.

  


She looked up, surprised. Cautious. But curious enough to follow. She stepped forward, and the moment her foot touched the path, the fog lifted. Just like that. As if it had never been there at all.

  


I was out. But she‚Ä¶She was in.

¬†

¬†

The forest was normal again. Birds chirped. The sun shone through the branches. I ran down the trail as fast as I could. Someone had to know. I had to tell them that a woman was missing. She needed help. She needed to be rescued. I didn‚Äôt stop running until I reached the mountain guard post, breathless and shaking.

¬†

¬†

‚Äú*Tolong, ada seorang wanita yang tersesat, dia memakai jaket warna merah, aku khawatir dia dalam bahaya*‚Äù | ‚ÄúHelp, there‚Äôs a woman who lost, she wears a red windbreaker. I am afraid that she will be in danger.‚Äù

¬†

¬†

The guard tilted his head. ‚Äú*Nggak ada pendaki yang belum turun. Wanita yang kamu bilang sudah turun sejam yang lalu. Nih, dia isi logbook-nya*‚Äù | ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one else up there. The woman you mentioned came down an hour before you, look, she signed the logbook.‚Äù¬†

¬†



Then he narrowed his eyes. ‚Äú*Bukannya kamu juga seharusnya sudah keluar kota?*‚Äù | ‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you supposed to be out of town‚Äù

¬†

¬†

‚Äú*Hah? Tapi saya tidak ‚Ä¶..*‚Äù | ‚ÄúWhat? But I didn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶.‚Äù My voice trailed off as my hands began to shake. I pulled out my phone and called my cousin. He picked up right away.

¬†

¬†

‚Äú*Kamu ke mana, kok kata Nenek tiba-tiba hilang?*‚Äù | ‚ÄúWhere did you go? Grandma said you suddenly disappeared!‚Äù

¬†

¬†

I replied shakily, ‚Äú*Sejak kapan aku sama Nenek?*‚Äù | ‚ÄúSince when was I with Grandma?‚Äù

¬†

¬†

He chuckled, confused. ‚Äú*Lah... dari seminggu yang lalu. Jangan bercanda, ah.*‚Äù | ‚ÄúSince a week ago. Don‚Äôt joke around.‚Äù

¬†

¬†

I froze. A week. To them, I never disappeared. Because something else took my place, and no one knew the difference. But now that I‚Äôm back‚Ä¶ it is gone. Returned to the fog. Because the path has opened.",1,1751838883.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I (M30) have known my friend (F29) for a long time. We were in a relationship years ago, broke up after about 3 years, but remained friends afterwards. We've been through a lot together, and I have always made a big effort to be there for her. She has done the same for me.

But over the last few years, she has started to be a little less close to me, friendship-wise. I can only speak for my own feelings - I am not interested in getting back together with her, but I highly value her friendship. Judging from her words, she feels the same as I do. Her actions - not so much. It's the usual things - not replying to messages, sometimes not seeing her for over a month, despite me reaching out to try and organise a meetup, a coffee, going to the cinema, etc.

One thing sticks in my mind, though. And it came up again a few days ago - the first time I had seen her in about 2 months. Even when we were in a relationship, we only ever went on a holiday out of the country once. We had a great time, but any other time I would try to plan another holiday out of the country, she always refused. She was too busy, she was already going on a holiday with other friends/family, she needed to save money (I offered many times to pay for everything, but she wouldn't accept this).

Ordinarily, I would just accept it. But over the last 3 years or so, she has started going on holidays with other people quite regularly. With other friends of hers, with her family, with work colleagues. I'd suggest a holiday sometime, offer to plan and book things, I'd get a refusal. Then I'd hear, the next time I see her ""Oh, I'm just back from Greece with my friend, it was an amazing trip."" I'd hear something similar a few months later, about another great trip from a friend of hers that I don't know.

To be honest, it makes me sad. I always get refused, and she always goes on amazing trips with other people I don't even know. As you can probably guess, at this stage of my life, I have fewer friends. I am mindful of not burdening her with things. But we're supposed to be friends. Quite close friends. Was that one trip we took a few years ago that bad? I can't think of anything bad that happened on that trip at all. I enjoyed it, she said she enjoyed it.

So, the choice I need advice on. Do I bring this up with her? Or do I keep it to myself? Embrace solo travel? I have made a big effort over the last few months to meet new people. And on a positive note, I have made new friends. But we're still not the level of friendship where we organise holidays to foreign countries.

And if I do bring up how lonely and sad I feel when I hear about her great holidays after she says she doesn't have the time/money to go on one with me - how do I approach this minefield of emotions?",2,1751838750.0,makemychoice,14,0.75,False

I had worked at a popular coffee shop chain (NOT STARBUCKS) for a little over a year and here‚Äôs why I decided to leave. I started in January of 2024 and things up until June went great, it was my first job there was a few problems but nothing major. Until June 13, 2024, when I fell on shift and ended up fracturing my hip. The next day on June 14, I let my manager know I wouldn‚Äôt be in for my shift that night and that I was currently at urgent care and would be filling a workers comp Monday when our operation manager (lets call him Smith)would be back in town from Father‚Äôs Day. When I sent Smith all the paper work including a doctors note saying I couldn‚Äôt come in until the 24th he said he‚Äôd fill the proper paperwork for my workers comp and let me know I was covered until the end of my doctors note. However he had the manager at the time ask me to come in on the 18th which I could not do, this was also the time I had a single weekend off and that‚Äôs solely because of me being injured. Three months later I finally hear back from the workers comp insurance agent asking why it wasn‚Äôt reported , I told them I had reported it to our operations manager and that I had been asking him at least once a week about it and he had been telling me that we were waiting on HR and the insurance to reach out to him they also told me that Smith had reported I was only working 15 hours a week when in reality my time clock showed 38/39 hours weekly. Then in December 2024 we got a new manager (lets call her H)
On my very first shift with H she was telling me all the details of her miscarriage and then she disappeared into the back of the shop and was snap chatting a couple worker telling her that she didn‚Äôt want to work with me and that she was going to be hiding out in the back until the end of the night. 

Things died down after that until January 2025 when I had my own miscarriage on shift and had to leave to change now one of the customers who notice goes to my church and so I told him and his wife what I was going through and I had also told two other customers who I knew decently well because they had also seen, and I told our assistant manager because I was on shift with her. I had also confided in a co worker who had claimed to be pregnant before and had kids of her own. Well H found out that I had told customers and co workers and not my boyfriend (who was on his graduation trip before it even happened) and she went around telling customers that I lied about my miscarriage because I was open about it and because i made jokes about it,when a co worker pointed out i make jokes out of my trauma H said I was just putting thoughts in their heads and that if I was actually going anything like I claimed that I wouldn‚Äôt make jokes. 

Fast forward about three weeks I was working a shift and a customer asked about the co worker that had kids and that co workers sister and sisters oh friend both confirmed said co worker never had kids and that the kids she claimed were hers was her little siblings and so feeling kinda betrayed because I went to her for support with my miscarriage I asked another customer who really was like our work mom if she had seen this co worker pregnant no details of what was going on or what was said. We‚Äôll that got back to H and she had written me up for spreading rumors which yeah I could see how that would be considered so, but she also wrote me for talking bad on a different co worker when I came in to open one morning and none of the closing things were done, we had no ice, dishes were still dirty, flavors weren‚Äôt stocked and a customer had asked why I was scrambling like chicken with no head, and I simply said the closers didn‚Äôt close properly. When she was talking to me about my write ups I just said okay to the spreading rumors one because yeah understandable on that however when she got to the talking bad about a co worker she asked me at the end if I had anything to add and when I tried to set that straight she interrupted me and got pissed off. That very day I sat in my car for two hours taking on the phone with customers and coworkers alike and that‚Äôs when I found out she told everyone I lied about my miscarriage and trauma and that the sole reason she didn‚Äôt like me was because I wouldn‚Äôt smoke weed with her mind you I am allergic, that‚Äôs also when I found out she sent those snaps to co workers about not wanting to work with me.  I had then found out she was telling customers who didn‚Äôt even ask about my write ups but telling them I was being rude and interrupting her the whole time. About a week later I texted the assistant manager to put in my two weeks because H and Smith wouldn‚Äôt answer my text or calls. Those two weeks went by and I notice I was still being put on shifts and I called H and let her know I couldn‚Äôt work that I had already put in my two weeks she was rude about it and told me she never received my notice and I asked my assistant if she sent it in and she said yes but that H blocked her because she didn‚Äôt invite H to the lake with her FAMILY.  All in after my two weeks ended I left and haven‚Äôt looked back but finding out what I did in that two hour phone call made me so mad I almost didn‚Äôt finish out my two weeks, I did text the operation manager a very detailed professional message of everything once I left and all he was was ‚Äú I‚Äôll look into it‚Äù which I know is short for ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù. I do have some screen shots i can post if needed for proof but as of now i just wanted to see if I was the A-Hole for quitting that job?

I (INFJ) have been best friends with an ESTP since childhood. We‚Äôve always had a deep bond, though she‚Äôs more ‚Äúwalls up‚Äù emotionally. Over the years, I‚Äôve learned to appreciate her actions more than words, and I know she values our friendship‚Äîeven if she rarely says it outright.

We had a major falling out five years ago (I was going through a hard time and got controlling‚Äîmy mistake), and though we‚Äôve had long breaks before, this one lasted years. Recently we reconnected and started casually talking again. It felt like things were slowly healing, so I asked to visit her in person. Her reaction? Sudden silence, followed by basically shutting it down and saying maybe we could grab coffee sometime.

I‚Äôm confused and hurt. Why does she always pull away like this? After 15+ years, I feel like I‚Äôm always the one initiating, caring, and chasing while she keeps me at arm‚Äôs length. I love her like family and would be there for her always. But this pattern is exhausting, and I don‚Äôt know how to move forward.

1ltd30q,https://www.reddit.com/r/beatles/comments/1ltd30q/i_made_a_list_of_my_personal_recommendations_of/,I made a list of my personal recommendations of SOLO Paul McCartney Books,"Posting this in case anyone is looking for something new to read or incase someone searches this topic and maybe this will come up and help them. This is going to be a mix of biography, academic, etc. Im not the best at getting my thoughts out, but I'll try my best. Also, the list is in no particular order of favorites. Ive read so many books (many i personally didnt like) and may edit this as I read more. I'll also include honorable mentions and ill see where this goes...

1. The McCartney Legacy volume 1: 1969-1973 by Allan Kozinn & Adrian Sinclair.  I think this is a good place to start my list because this is definitely the most popular book released on Paul's solo career. Its extremely in depth (720 pages)  plenty of interviews done for this book, it covers recording sessions and basically as much info on Paul's life at the time as possible. 

2. The McCartney Legacy volume 2: 1974-1980. 768 pages, and again the most in depth book on paul during this period. Based on many comments I've seen on reddit and other sites, I think many will agree that these two books are the best on Paul's solo career.

3. Paul McCartney: The Recording Sessions 1969-2013 by Luca Perasi. The only book that focuses on nothing except the recording sessions. It will tell you when and where it was recorded, who played what, I think its an essential book. 13 years have passed since its release, and a lot of new info has come out so I think it would do good if a new edition came out and updated the info, for example some personnel on songs are not known, so it will have a question mark if it isn't known who played what, but until then... this is certainly a one of a kind reference book.

4. Paul McCartney: The Stories Behind The Songs volume 1- 1970-1989 by Luca Perasi. You may be asking yourself how this is different from Paul's own ""The Lyrics"" book. Well, for one, Paul isn't the one telling it... not exactly. It goes in order from the first song on McCartney 1 to the last song on Flowers In The Dirt, but in between it goes over unreleased songs (some songs that don't even exist on boot legs) and released songs from that time period that didn't make an album. It tells us who played what, when and where it was recorded, what it was released on. So in a way it has info that the recording sessions book has, but some info is more updated and it has stuff taken from interviews. Some interviews the author did, and many taken from any source he could find like magazines, documentaries or other people's interviews where Paul has spoken, musicians speaking who worked with paul, producers etc. It also briefly goes over things like live albums, so for this one is talks briefly about Wings Over America.


5. Paul McCartney: The Stories Behind The Songs volume 2 - 1990-2012 by Luca Perasi. Same as number 4, but for the years mentioned in the title. Once again it also goes over live albums and also any new songs added like how Vanilla Sky was on Back In The U.S. 

6. Band On The Run: The Story of a Classic Album by Luca Perasi. You may think a popular album like this has been written about to death, but that's the great thing about writers. They can always give us new views and new insights. If memory serves me right, I believe Luca had some help with the authors of the legacy series on this. Its not a big book by any means, which makes it great if youre specifically interested in this album and dont want one of the many books covering Paul's 70s career just to flip to that part. It covers the making, gave me new insight into the mugging that occurred in Africa, tells us about the charts, its reception at the time and context of the music scene, how its seen now, and more.  This is a part of a new series called ""Milestone"" where authors write about iconic albums, and Luca is the one doing Paul's albums. I believe some other author wrote one in the series for XTC but I haven't read it.

7. Press To Play: That Unmistakable 80s Sound by Luca Perasi. Another book in the Milestone series (next he's doing RAM!). Basically does what number 6 does, but for the album Press To Play. He interviewed people involved in it, including producer Hugh Padgham. This One is especially interesting to me, because it really is a different album for Paul. Paul overlooks it and I think he actually doesnt think too highly of it, and it certainly sounds dated, but I think its an interesting time capsule into Paul's career.  After reading this I have a new love for an akbum I once kind of laughed at. In fact, for a decade now my favorite Paul song was Coming Up, but this year I've been realizing it isn't anymore... its ""Footprints""! It really was cool seeing this album in context of all the other stuff coming out in the 1980s.

8. Wings Live (special extended edition) by Adrian Allan. There's two versions of this book. Regular, which has 400 pages, and the special extended edition which adds 236 more pages totalling to 636. Ive never read the original one, but the extended one is incredible. This one adds new evidence from newspapers, interviews, photographs and fan accounts. Well, that's not it. I suggest reading the [book description to get the full idea](https://www.amazon.com/Wings-Extended-Special-Adrian-ALLAN/dp/B0BNYXG5LF/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=64CGK&content-id=amzn1.sym.9f654aa3-75f1-42ea-bb2c-1136f91b121f&pf_rd_p=9f654aa3-75f1-42ea-bb2c-1136f91b121f&pf_rd_r=143-4139433-5487435&pd_rd_wg=f3VHR&pd_rd_r=480dd327-bc07-483d-af91-b74fa5aa9407&ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk) . This covers everything from their very first live show on February 9th 1972 to the canceled Japan tour of 1980. Every single show! Fan accounts of various shows, new photos that hadn't been seen until this book, interesting interviews. Basically, if you love Wings you need this one on your eyeballs. Did you know Paul actually has played ""Some People Never Know"" live? Dd

9. Paul McCartney The World Tour 1989-90 by Adrian Allan. It does the same thing as number 8 does, but specifically for his 1989/90 world tour. Once again, I suggest reading the description to get the full idea, and links will be posted at the end. Here's a snippet ""The main body of the book details every single concert of the 102-date tour, and includes reviews of all the known audio and film footage and contributions from fans who attended the concerts""

10. Paul McCartney After The Beatles: A Musical Appreciation by Adrian Allan. This book is the best musical analysis for Paul in my opinion. Its aimed at both those who are familiar with music theory, and those who want to learn a bit about it (like me). The book includes a beginners guide to music theory and a glossary. I'll copy its description since it can say it better than me. ""

Eighty of McCartney's post-Beatles songs are discussed in the format of short, but accessible essays. For each song, full details are provided concerning date of release; place of recording; instrumentation; and key signature. The description for each song details the musical techniques that McCartney uses, such as chord patterns; structure; use of instruments; vocal harmony; tonality; and key changes. In addition, every chapter details his life and work in each decade. A conclusion identifies the main characteristics of McCartney's style. The appendix details every recording location used.""

11. Paul McCartney After The Beatles: A Musical Appreciation volume 2 by Adrian Allan. It does what the last book does, but a different 50 post-beatles songs and for those with no idea what its talking about, I think its a great start for learning with an artist you love like Paul. It gives us beginners an index of terms and shows us specific examples from Paul's songs about what he's talking about. It also has a cool interview with Pauls former drummer Geoff Britton.

12. The Songs He Was Singing volume 1-5 by John Blaney. Each volume covers a decades from the 70s to the 2010s. This one is more a reference book series rather than something I would read front to back (just in my opinion.) Like other books I mentioned, this one goes over who played what, dates of recording and locations. Also includes stories behind songs like others i mentioned (but again, its always great hearing well-researched authors write in their own style.) I think the strong point that makes this series stand out is definitely the fact that it covers more modern Paul too, which a lot of writers dont, at least at the moment. Another stand out part of the series is that each book is includes hundreds of photos showing off and going over different releases of albums and formats and singles across the world and different labels. It's like a book version of discogs, but solely Paul related. Also for the 2010s it doesnt just cover Kisses, NEW and Egypt Station, but all the archive releases and material on them, so no, youre not just getting three albums in that book. Also, I've seen some say the book covers suck, but I think they're cool! The front cover is always a picture of the release that started the decade and the back shows the record that ended the decade!

13.  Man On The Run: Paul McCartney in the 1970s by Tom Doyle. So this book came out in 2014, and if you dont know, this was almost rare to write about solo Paul in 2014! It wasnt until about the last 5ish years where authors started to really get into Paul after the Beatles. I think its a good book, and at the time of release probably the best book ever on Paul. It isn't detailing as much as a book like the Legacy series, but at 288 pages Im including this for any fan looking for a quicker read that covers a whole decade but isn't ready to be overwhelmed by the larger books. I really enjoy how this book portrayed Linda too. 

14. Macca In The Long Noughties: Paul McCartney tracks, life and tours 1998-2009 by Ian D. Derbyshire. This book covers the decade of Paul's life after Linda's passing. Not a huge book (221 pages) but its certainly the best book I've found for this time period. It covers Paul and Heather's relationship and marriage more than other books which I was glad to learn more about. A good balance of writing on his personal life/struggles and his fame/career. In fact i can think of only one other book that really goes this late into his life as a more biography-like book and this one is better to me. I'll mention that book later though. 

15. Fab: An Intimate of Paul McCartney by Howard Sounes. This book was published in 2010, and i hadn't read it until this year. Ive actually read it twice this year, after spending a lot of time debating on it after seeing mixed opinions. Yet another book written in a time where not many existed, but I'd say given that its 15 years old it really holds up. Its almost 600 pages and goes over his childhood up to shortly before the book was published. 600 pages isn't enough to cover 68 years of Paul, but what he did in those 600 pages was really good work. I was impressed by his research and the one down side to the book is that the author does put his opinions in places its not needed, but the facts are well-sourced, so while i tried to keep my list limited in books that have authors telling us what they think, I think this one deserved to be mentioned. This was the book I was referring to on number 14. I think Ian Derbyshire's book covers the 2000s decade better, but for a book about 1942-2010 , Howard's is awesome!

16. The Beatles Diary: Volume 2 After The Breakup - 1970-2001 by Keith Badman and Barry Miles. This book does talk about John, George and Ringo too, and for all that, it's even better. But even on a list for just solo Paul books I think its really great. It really is just like a diary. Want to know what Paul and the others were up to on January 17th 1974? Flip to 1974 and find January! After John's death it does talk about things Yoko did related to John and the Beatles. 

17. The Paul McCartney Encyclopedia by Bill Harry. Bill was the creator of Mersey Beat magazine. He went to the same school as John and Stuart, and even arranged for Epstein to see the beatles perform on November 9 1961. This book is exactly what the title says. It was published in 2002 so it only has stuff up to then. Wanna know about the band ""The Escorts"" or what Paul had to with Sacr√©e Soir√©e? Its in there, alphabetical, because it's a Paul encyclopedia!

18. The Lyrics: 1956 To The Present by Paul McCartney. This book covers, i believe 154 songs in hard cover (paperback is 161 songs, but excludes some photos and photos are now black and white instead of color). They go in alphabetical order and its cool hearing Paul speak on songs he's written. It covers Beatles too, but since it had solo stuff I included it. Now Paul, this is his words from his memory. I love the man, but he has spent over half a century working on music , touring, shaking hands that some things he says as fact have been proven wrong by Beatles historians and researchers. Don't take this as me saying he's intentionally lying to us, because he isn't and the examples are few. This book is incredible because its Paul saying what he remembers and I think its beautiful we got something like this. Has anyone else noticed to rise in singers doing books like this since Paul? Willie Nelson, John Darnielle, Joni Mitchell, Johnny Cash's family/estate. Ive heard rumors about other legends doing the same soon...

19. Conversations With McCartney by Paul De Noyer. This book is awesome because the author pulled from many close talks he's had with paul over like 35 years. It will go over the big things like Beatles and Wings, plus smaller things like how Paul likes his tea. This book made me feel like we got a more intimate look at Paul rather than an interviewer asking the same thing and paul giving us the same short answer.

Also later this year Paul will be releasing his own book detailing his time with Wings. I have high hopes for it.

#THE END

Well that's really it. Time for honorable mentions. 

1. Many Years From Now by Barry Miles. This book is actually one of the best Paul books ever! Barry wrote it from interviews he had with Paul, while paul knew he was making this, so in a way it's almost like an autobiography. The reason it didnt make my main list is because it came out in 1997, yet its 99% Beatles and the section covering the solo years just felt rushed to me. But if youre looking on learning about Paul and his side of things from the Beatles, this is a great book.


2. Blackbird Singing: Poems and Lyrics 1965-1999 by Paul McCartney.  This book is just collected poems and lyrics. No stories behind them. Just the words of the poems or songs. It's cool, because i promise you you'll read something that you didnt know existed, but other than that, it isn't some ground breaking book.

3. Little Wing: The Jimmy McCulloch Story by Paul Salley. The author is actually here on reddit and has posted that a new extended edition will be coming out soon, but the first edition is awesome. Jimmy is my personal favorite of Paul's Wings guitarists and he was there as a part of their most famous line up. This isn't just about Jimmy with Wings, it's his life story, its his time with other bands and his life as a kid. If youre a huge Wings fan though, I think this will be a good read for you. 

4. Guitar With Wings: A Photographic Memoir by Laurence Juber. Another guitarist from Wings. This book is cool to me because it gives us a look at the final line up through the eyes of someone who was there. 

5. Wingspan: Paul McCartney‚Äôs Band On The Run by Paul McCartney. This is a coffee table photography book that came out along with the Wingspan documentary and CD. Some cool photos of the band! Not the most in depth book on their history, the documentary does better as, as do many other books. 

6. Linda McCartney: The Polaroid Diaires by Ekow Eshun (author) Reuel Golden (editor) and Linda McCartney (photographer). This is a collection of many Polaroid photos taken by Linda. By far my favorite of the photography books I've mentioned so far. Again, mostly just photos. Some will say the location and year/approximate year it was taken. Some don't. 

7. The Beatles After The Beatles: Narrative & Discography by Luca Perasi. This goes over all 4 Beatles in 2 volumes. The first is the narrative of 1967-1980 and the second is the discography of 1967-1980. I put it here because it isn't just about Paul, but they're great. The narrative has been written about a lot, but its nice to have a well researched book in one small-ish volume and one to read about their released music too.

Another underrated source of info is the Maccazines by a Netherlands based fan club. They release twice a year. Extensive research and a great editor. I believe I've only ever noticed one error which was a simple typo. I'll include a link to their site but they write about everything so ill leave it up to you to check out their site. Im in USA so it usually takes about 3 weeks for me to receive my package, sometimes 2 weeks. 

----

Okay, here are some stuff I *personally* didnt care for. Just my opinion, and I think it can be a good thing to read everything available, even when you know things will be bad or have heard bad things. Most importantly I think everyone should form their own opinion, but I also think reading everything will help you better spot inaccurate information.  I did not care for Philip Norman's book. It reads like an author who hates his subject. Every author is gonna have a bias, some worse than others, but it came across very condescending to me. I didnt care for any of Geoffrey Giuliano's books on Paul because he often claims things or quotes things without any source, and sometimes those claims are wild enough you ask who the source is and you can't find any when you look into yourself. I didnt care for ""Fly Away Paul"" by Lesley-Ann Jones. It was a rehash of Tom Doyle's ""Man On The Run"" but with some very obvious inaccuracies. ""Off The Ground: Paul McCartney in the 1990s"" by JR Moores, i had such high hopes but 320 pages just wasn't enough to scratch the surface of the 90s. I think its good when books give context of the music scene in an era but the author did that SO MUCH i think he forgot he was writing about Paul.

Last one that comes to mind is books by Rchard Ward. He has a series called ""Iconic Albums"" and did many for Paul. The book cover and short length (usually less than 100 pages) made me suspect. The cover looked AI, but I wasnt sure. I ordered a used copy of his book on RAM, its very obviously AI written, wrong info and very poorly formatted. So I haven't bothered reading any of his other books, but each book uses the same AI art style that im not going to bother.

 There are other books I thought were bad, and others I thought were good, but didnt feel the need to mention because they either slipped my mind (I typed this over 3 days) or the good books (many released in the 70s-80s) have newer books like it with updated / better info.

But once again, these are just my opinions and recommendations for someone looking for a paul book and hoping this can help decide what they want and where to start.

This is going to be a mix of biography, academic, etc. Im not the best at getting my thoughts out, but I'll try my best. Also, the list is in no particular order of favorites. Ive read so many books (many i personally didnt like) and may edit this as I read more. I'll also include honorable mentions and ill see where this goes...

1. The McCartney Legacy volume 1: 1969-1973 by Allan Kozinn & Adrian Sinclair.  I think this is a good place to start my list because this is definitely the most popular book released on Paul's solo career. Its extremely in depth (720 pages)  plenty of interviews done for this book, it covers recording sessions and basically as much info on Paul's life at the time as possible. 

2. The McCartney Legacy volume 2: 1974-1980. 768 pages, and again the most in depth book on paul during this period. Based on many comments I've seen on reddit and other sites, I think many will agree that these two books are the best on Paul's solo career.

3. Paul McCartney: The Recording Sessions 1969-2013 by Luca Perasi. The only book that focuses on nothing except the recording sessions. It will tell you when and where it was recorded, who played what, I think its an essential book. 13 years have passed since its release, and a lot of new info has come out so I think it would do good if a new edition came out and updated the info, for example some personnel on songs are not known, so it will have a question mark if it isn't known who played what, but until then... this is certainly a one of a kind reference book.

4. Paul McCartney: The Stories Behind The Songs volume 1- 1970-1989 by Luca Perasi. You may be asking yourself how this is different from Paul's own ""The Lyrics"" book. Well, for one, Paul isn't the one telling it... not exactly. It goes in order from the first song on McCartney 1 to the last song on Flowers In The Dirt, but in between it goes over unreleased songs (some songs that don't even exist on boot legs) and released songs from that time period that didn't make an album. It tells us who played what, when and where it was recorded, what it was released on. So in a way it has info that the recording sessions book has, but some info is more updated and it has stuff taken from interviews. Some interviews the author did, and many taken from any source he could find like magazines, documentaries or other people's interviews where Paul has spoken, musicians speaking who worked with paul, producers etc. It also briefly goes over things like live albums, so for this one is talks briefly about Wings Over America.


5. Paul McCartney: The Stories Behind The Songs volume 2 - 1990-2012 by Luca Perasi. Same as number 4, but for the years mentioned in the title. Once again it also goes over live albums and also any new songs added like how Vanilla Sky was on Back In The U.S. 

6. Band On The Run: The Story of a Classic Album by Luca Perasi. You may think a popular album like this has been written about to death, but that's the great thing about writers. They can always give us new views and new insights. If memory serves me right, I believe Luca had some help with the authors of the legacy series on this. Its not a big book by any means, which makes it great if youre specifically interested in this album and dont want one of the many books covering Paul's 70s career just to flip to that part. It covers the making, gave me new insight into the mugging that occurred in Africa, tells us about the charts, its reception at the time and context of the music scene, how its seen now, and more.  This is a part of a new series called ""Milestone"" where authors write about iconic albums, and Luca is the one doing Paul's albums. I believe some other author wrote one in the series for XTC but I haven't read it.

7. Press To Play: That Unmistakable 80s Sound by Luca Perasi. Another book in the Milestone series (next he's doing RAM!). Basically does what number 6 does, but for the album Press To Play. He interviewed people involved in it, including producer Hugh Padgham. This One is especially interesting to me, because it really is a different album for Paul. Paul overlooks it and I think he actually doesnt think too highly of it, and it certainly sounds dated, but I think its an interesting time capsule into Paul's career.  After reading this I have a new love for an akbum I once kind of laughed at. In fact, for a decade now my favorite Paul song was Coming Up, but this year I've been realizing it isn't anymore... its ""Footprints""! It really was cool seeing this album in context of all the other stuff coming out in the 1980s.

8. Wings Live (special extended edition) by Adrian Allan. There's two versions of this book. Regular, which has 400 pages, and the special extended edition which adds 236 more pages totalling to 636. Ive never read the original one, but the extended one is incredible. This one adds new evidence from newspapers, interviews, photographs and fan accounts. Well, that's not it. I suggest reading the [book description to get the full idea](https://www.amazon.com/Wings-Extended-Special-Adrian-ALLAN/dp/B0BNYXG5LF/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=64CGK&content-id=amzn1.sym.9f654aa3-75f1-42ea-bb2c-1136f91b121f&pf_rd_p=9f654aa3-75f1-42ea-bb2c-1136f91b121f&pf_rd_r=143-4139433-5487435&pd_rd_wg=f3VHR&pd_rd_r=480dd327-bc07-483d-af91-b74fa5aa9407&ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk) . This covers everything from their very first live show on February 9th 1972 to the canceled Japan tour of 1980. Every single show! Fan accounts of various shows, new photos that hadn't been seen until this book, interesting interviews. Basically, if you love Wings you need this one on your eyeballs. Did you know Paul actually has played ""Some People Never Know"" live? Dd

9. Paul McCartney The World Tour 1989-90 by Adrian Allan. It does the same thing as number 8 does, but specifically for his 1989/90 world tour. Once again, I suggest reading the description to get the full idea, and links will be posted at the end. Here's a snippet ""The main body of the book details every single concert of the 102-date tour, and includes reviews of all the known audio and film footage and contributions from fans who attended the concerts""

10. Paul McCartney After The Beatles: A Musical Appreciation by Adrian Allan. This book is the best musical analysis for Paul in my opinion.

It wasnt until about the last 5ish years where authors started to really get into Paul after the Beatles. I think its a good book, and at the time of release probably the best book ever on Paul.

Willie Nelson, John Darnielle, Joni Mitchell, Johnny Cash's family/estate. Ive heard rumors about other legends doing the same soon...

19. Conversations With McCartney by Paul De Noyer. This book is awesome because the author pulled from many close talks he's had with paul over like 35 years. It will go over the big things like Beatles and Wings, plus smaller things like how Paul likes his tea. This book made me feel like we got a more intimate look at Paul rather than an interviewer asking the same thing and paul giving us the same short answer.

Also later this year Paul will be releasing his own book detailing his time with Wings. I have high hopes for it.

#THE END

Well that's really it. Time for honorable mentions. 

1. Many Years From Now by Barry Miles. This book is actually one of the best Paul books ever! Barry wrote it from interviews he had with Paul, while paul knew he was making this, so in a way it's almost like an autobiography. The reason it didnt make my main list is because it came out in 1997, yet its 99% Beatles and the section covering the solo years just felt rushed to me. But if youre looking on learning about Paul and his side of things from the Beatles, this is a great book.


2. Blackbird Singing: Poems and Lyrics 1965-1999 by Paul McCartney.  This book is just collected poems and lyrics. No stories behind them. Just the words of the poems or songs. It's cool, because i promise you you'll read something that you didnt know existed, but other than that, it isn't some ground breaking book.

3. Little Wing: The Jimmy McCulloch Story by Paul Salley. The author is actually here on reddit and has posted that a new extended edition will be coming out soon, but the first edition is awesome. Jimmy is my personal favorite of Paul's Wings guitarists and he was there as a part of their most famous line up. This isn't just about Jimmy with Wings, it's his life story, its his time with other bands and his life as a kid. If youre a huge Wings fan though, I think this will be a good read for you. 

4. Guitar With Wings: A Photographic Memoir by Laurence Juber. Another guitarist from Wings. This book is cool to me because it gives us a look at the final line up through the eyes of someone who was there. 

5. Wingspan: Paul McCartney‚Äôs Band On The Run by Paul McCartney. This is a coffee table photography book that came out along with the Wingspan documentary and CD. Some cool photos of the band! Not the most in depth book on their history, the documentary does better as, as do many other books. 

6. Linda McCartney: The Polaroid Diaires by Ekow Eshun (author) Reuel Golden (editor) and Linda McCartney (photographer). This is a collection of many Polaroid photos taken by Linda. By far my favorite of the photography books I've mentioned so far. Again, mostly just photos. Some will say the location and year/approximate year it was taken. Some don't. 

7. The Beatles After The Beatles: Narrative & Discography by Luca Perasi. This goes over all 4 Beatles in 2 volumes. The first is the narrative of 1967-1980 and the second is the discography of 1967-1980. I put it here because it isn't just about Paul, but they're great. The narrative has been written about a lot, but its nice to have a well researched book in one small-ish volume and one to read about their released music too.

Another underrated source of info is the Maccazines by a Netherlands based fan club. They release twice a year. Extensive research and a great editor. I believe I've only ever noticed one error which was a simple typo. I'll include a link to their site but they write about everything so ill leave it up to you to check out their site. Im in USA so it usually takes about 3 weeks for me to receive my package, sometimes 2 weeks. 

----

Okay, here are some stuff I *personally* didnt care for. Just my opinion, and I think it can be a good thing to read everything available, even when you know things will be bad or have heard bad things. Most importantly I think everyone should form their own opinion, but I also think reading everything will help you better spot inaccurate information.  I did not care for Philip Norman's book. It reads like an author who hates his subject. Every author is gonna have a bias, some worse than others, but it came across very condescending to me. I didnt care for any of Geoffrey Giuliano's books on Paul because he often claims things or quotes things without any source, and sometimes those claims are wild enough you ask who the source is and you can't find any when you look into yourself. I didnt care for ""Fly Away Paul"" by Lesley-Ann Jones. It was a rehash of Tom Doyle's ""Man On The Run"" but with some very obvious inaccuracies. ""Off The Ground: Paul McCartney in the 1990s"" by JR Moores, i had such high hopes but 320 pages just wasn't enough to scratch the surface of the 90s. I think its good when books give context of the music scene in an era but the author did that SO MUCH i think he forgot he was writing about Paul.

Last one that comes to mind is books by Rchard Ward. He has a series called ""Iconic Albums"" and did many for Paul. The book cover and short length (usually less than 100 pages) made me suspect. The cover looked AI, but I wasnt sure. I ordered a used copy of his book on RAM, its very obviously AI written, wrong info and very poorly formatted. So I haven't bothered reading any of his other books, but each book uses the same AI art style that im not going to bother.

 There are other books I thought were bad, and others I thought were good, but didnt feel the need to mention because they either slipped my mind (I typed this over 3 days) or the good books (many released in the 70s-80s) have newer books like it with updated / better info.

But once again, these are just my opinions and recommendations for someone looking for a paul book and hoping this can help decide what they want and where to start.

1ltcxdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1ltcxdq/10_year_old_boy_constantly_wants_food_but_wont/,10 year old boy constantly wants food but wont eat at home.,"I'm really struggling with my stepsons relationship with food and I'm honestly starting to get angry about it. 

In the last 2 years, my stepson has taken up lying like a first language, and has told people we dont feed him. This is furthest from the truth. The reality is that he refuses to eat anything other than bear paws and buttered toast at home, and then begs for fast food (and even tries to back seat order in drive thru when we've already told him no. I usually only get a tea or coffee and i do always ask if they want a drink, no food!) 

Weve talked to him multiple times, his mom has talked to him multiple times, and even his grandparents. Hes not getting it. I try and accommodate his 'picky palette' but aside from pizza and garbage, this kid refuses to eat anything with nutrients.

We also need to remind him to eat, because if we dont he will wait until he is literally starving and then eat an entire large pizza to himself (has happened on multiple occasions here and at his moms.)

This weekend spesfically, I reminded him multiple times after waking up that he needed to eat something. He finally settled on a bear paw. I asked if he wanted waffles, fruit, cereal, toast, etc. And he turned everything down. ""I'm not hungry."" And ""I dont have an appetite."" Were all he kept saying (and always says.)

My MIL came to pick him up for the drive home and I asked again if he wanted anything.  I looked at her and said that he has refused anything other than a bear paw so he cant tell you or mom that I didnt feed him (she knows about the previous incident). He just looked at her with a big grin. They wernt 10 minutes out of town when he said ""time for a peach juice and pizza.""  

I am FULLY aware that my MIL likely gave in and bought it for him, and that is part of the issue for SURE. But this isnt even the only issue. He is notorious for trying to back seat order (as stated above) and will try to order a full big mac meal while eating snacks, he will ask for 3 small burgers and shove one in the car door which he will forget about and not even eat. The waste of money is driving me insane, especially when both households have had to use a foodbank recently and many times before, and he is aware that we (collectively) cant afford to waste food. 

We are all at our witts ends, and maybe I'm just missing something that hes trying to tell me. I just need fresh eyes to look at this situation and give me some options here...

Things to note:
He just turned 10
He is around 120lbs
He is with us EOW in the summer and EOWE durring school
He does not take ANY information in when talking to him
I make food that he likes ALL THE TIME, he even asks me to send the recipes to his mom so she can make them too.
He lies so much that hes even caused CAS to be involved briefly (it was open and shut immediately because he admitted right away that it was a lie when cops came.)

TLDR; My 10 year old refuses eat food at home then complains that hes starving. ",2,1751838155.0,Parenting,2,1.0,False

1ltcwa8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/comments/1ltcwa8/the_day_the_tree_was_cleaned/,‚ÄúThe Day the Tree Was Cleaned‚Äù,"It started like any other night. FamilySearch users all over the world were adding cousins, disputing sources, and arguing over whether Sir William de Blah actually lived to be 143 years old.

And then, around 2:12 am. Mountain Time... the Tree went dark.

At first, it seemed like a hiccup. A little downtime. Scheduled maintenance, perhaps. But when the servers didn‚Äôt come back online after five minutes, users began whispering. Reddit lit up. Facebook exploded. People tried to refresh their pages. Then they tried other browsers. Then other devices.

Nothing.

By morning, it was clear:¬†the entire Family Tree was gone.

Not one branch. Not one name. Just a blank screen.

Salt Lake City was in chaos. Engineers were called in. Backup servers were activated. Nothing worked. One poor intern tried to re-import a saved version from his laptop and was met with a single message:

""The Tree is not ready.""

Genealogists panicked. There were reports of family historians wandering the streets muttering, ""But she¬†was¬†born in Prussia...""

And then, thirty-six hours later, something changed.

The Tree began to return.

But it wasn't the same Tree.

Gone were the question marks. Gone were the Mrs. of Someplaces and the ? ?s of Nowheres. There were no duplicate spouses, no 900-year-old ancestors, no children born 75 years after their mother died. Dates were complete. Locations used the modern map. Every entry was clean, properly formatted, and‚Äîincredibly‚Äîsourced.

Somehow...¬†everything was correct.

A stunned silence settled over Salt Lake. The engineers were baffled. The mods were confused. The FamilySearch community managers stared at their screens in awe.

‚ÄúWhat happened to our mess?‚Äù someone finally whispered.

They tried tracing the change. Logs were blank. No edits. No IP trails. No batch merges. No signs of intrusion.

And yet, the Tree lived again.

Users began poking around. The usual troll accounts had vanished. Bad merges? Gone. Source-less speculation? Wiped out. Every record in the Tree now met standards that had never even been implemented. And every attempt to upload junk data‚Äîlike a child born in 1330 to parents from 1964‚Äîwas instantly rejected.

""Data does not meet minimum verification threshold. Entry denied.""

It was as if the Tree had grown a spine. A conscience. Standards.

Somewhere deep in the digital wilderness, genealogists wept. Some danced. One woman fainted when she discovered her great-great-grandmother had finally been listed with her¬†correct¬†birthdate.

And in the middle of all this, one old monitor in Illinois flickered to life.

She sipped her coffee. A slow, knowing smile crept across her face.

On her screen, a simple message blinked once, then disappeared:

""The Tree has been restored. You're welcome.""

And from that day forward, the Tree remained pristine.

No one ever figured out how it happened.

But every now and then, when a new user tries to enter ""? ? born in Europe,"" the system pauses...

Numbness in hands and feet
Losing hair and very thin hair
A lot of fatigue 
Restless legs 
Night sweats
Burning sensation in like my esophagus area
Slight Pain on the right side of my chest 
A little pain by my liver area
Stomach slightly upset and making noises
Neck feeling swollen
Slight Throat pain 

I have a very similar diet to my brother and his blood work was completely normal. I believe my diet is not really the issue for my low ferritin.

I stopped coffee two weeks ago after getting a low ferritin and I‚Äôve noticed the pain in my chest I had and my throat pain are almost gone. I would also always had to use the bathroom after drinking coffee. Max 10 minutes in.

I‚Äôve done numerous blood tests and they‚Äôve all been normal besides this recent result. I‚Äôm not sure why they didn‚Äôt test my ferritin or iron until just now? My hemoglobin in 15.

I‚Äôve already been cleared by a pulmonologist and ENT doctor. I‚Äôve just been referred to a gastroenterologist.
I‚Äôm doing some FIT test via fecal and dropping it off tomorrow. Also did an h pylori test and it was clear.

Again, not sure what‚Äôs happening. Anyone have any advice?

My current symptoms today out of all those symptoms are:

Restless legs
Hair thinning

For those who aren‚Äôt familiar with Starbucks‚Äôs language, a ‚Äúcoaching‚Äù is the equivalent for a verbal warning that you aren‚Äôt doing something right and you need to change your action and/or behavior. What I used to say to all my customers was ‚ÄúWelcome to Starbucks! How are you doing today?‚Äù before I would begin asking for their order. I‚Äôve always been praised for this from my former managers, partners, and customers for this friendly greeting and I‚Äôve never received any complaints in all the years I‚Äôve worked at this company until last week. I respectfully declined to switch my prompt at the speaker box because I felt that the new response the company wants us to go with is short and unwelcoming. My district manager encouraged me to change it to ‚ÄúWelcome to Starbucks! What can we get started for you?‚Äù and completely omit the friendly question because it takes too long in the drive thru to ask everyone how their day is going and it negatively impacts our drive thru times. We currently have the worst customer service experience rating in our district at an 89% and our drive times are one of the fastest in the district. I personally feel that our store should be prioritizing the customer experience and their argument to me is that a longer drive thru time is not valuing the customer experience. 

I‚Äôm a certified Coffee Master and they sent me to Costa Rica in 2023 for the Origins Trip Experience. I have several reviews on Google that mention me by name and how much the customers appreciate what I bring to their interactions. I‚Äôve never had any sort of problems with partners, customers, or any sort of ‚Äúcoaching‚Äù conversations until last week. I went into work today and saw this flyer posted in our break room, and I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôm supposed to continue to work here when it‚Äôs so blatantly obvious that they do not care about our customers or our partners. The incentive for managers and district managers to keep lower drive times throughout the year is to obtain a bonus at the end of the year, but there is no bonus for a good customer connection score. 

If any of my current customers are reading this message, I just want to apologize from the bottom of my heart because we don‚Äôt deserve you, your money, or your kindness. I won‚Äôt be able to talk with you in the drive thru anymore because this company is choosing to assume that every customer wants a robotic interaction that is fast, efficient, and short.

To protect the identities of the dead I‚Äôll just call my friends Tom, Dick and Harry. Me, You can call John, we‚Äôd known each other since the 3rd grade and always been thick as thieves. 


The year this all happened, the stars had aligned, and we were all free for the Memorial Day weekend. So we decided to drive a few miles north of where we live to go camping in a small state park. 


We loaded up Tom‚Äôs car with supplies and grabbed a cooler full of hot dogs and beer before setting out, and by sunset, we were all ready for a great weekend. 


That was when he arrived. 


He was a tall, clean-shaven man dressed in a polo shirt and khakis who smiled like a painted doll. Almost at once, I noticed a bruise on his forehead that looked pretty nasty. He stepped out from the treeline just as we were settling down to eat and startled us half to death. 


It was a public campsite, but slightly out of the way, so we hadn‚Äôt really expected anyone to walk through. Still, he wasn‚Äôt doing anything wrong, so we just nodded and waved when he looked at us. 


‚ÄúHey guys!‚Äù He bounded over, ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Dave, don‚Äôt you just love camping!‚Äù As he spoke, he stuck out his hand to shake, that too wide grin never faltering. 


‚ÄúUh yeah,‚Äù I muttered awkwardly, accepting his hand, which, despite the manic force he applied to everything else, was a limp, wet fish of a handshake. 


‚ÄúNice car!‚Äù He nodded towards Tom‚Äôs old station wagon, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs it insured with?‚Äù 


‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Tom asked, somewhere between confused and annoyed. 


‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry!‚Äù The man, Dave, laughed. ‚ÄúI sell auto policies for Polidyne Insurance, can‚Äôt seem to turn it off when I‚Äôm not at work!‚Äù 


‚ÄúRight‚Ä¶‚Äù Tom was looking around, bewildered. ‚ÄúSo, we were just making dinner.‚Äù He left that hanging, hoping Dave would take a hint, but the man just blinked at us vacantly. We were all a bit drunk now, but still we eyed each other nervously as he sat down on the other side of the fire. The smoke was blowing that way, and he must have been getting a face full of it, but he didn‚Äôt show it. 


We all sat dumbfounded for a while before Harry reached into the cooler and pulled out a hot dog and put it on a stick. Shrugging at the rest of our dirty looks, he handed it to Dave and asked, ‚ÄúYou want some food?‚Äù 


‚ÄúSure!‚Äù Dave said, his grin unmoving on his face. 


We all looked around at each other nervously as he cooked the sausage and put it into a bun Harry slid his way. ‚ÄúDo you boys have any mayonnaise?‚Äù He asked, looking at us. 


‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered, tossing him a bottle. 


‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù He exclaimed as if I had given him the meaning of life, ‚ÄúMayonnaise is the sauce of the aristocrat, you know?‚Äù This bizarre statement was punctuated by him dumping an unpleasant amount of the white sauce onto the hot dog and proceeding to eat it in two bites. Leaving ugly white smears around his face. It was then, staring at him in disgust, that I noticed the bruise on his forehead was gone. That wasn‚Äôt possible, I rationalized that it had to have been a trick of the light. 

‚ÄúWhat does that even mean?‚Äù Asked Tom looking slightly green at his table manners. Dave only looked at him and slowly blinked as if he hadn‚Äôt understood the question before swallowing the last bite of his sausage. 


‚ÄúLook man‚Äù Dick straightened up, he had had the most to drink out of all of us. Which is probably why he‚Äôd let it go this far, but I could tell from his tone he was beyond annoyed. ‚ÄúWe came up here to camp with our friends for a weekend, we don‚Äôt know you. So please leave‚Äù his jaw was tight as he spoke, and I watched, waiting for a fight, unsure if I would help him or pull him off  


Dave only nodded, looking slightly sad, and said, ‚ÄúOf course, I don‚Äôt mean to be a bother. If any of you are looking for a new insurance policy, however, you know where to find me!‚Äù With that, he walked away down the dirt path towards the rest of the campsites. As he walked, I noticed there was dirt and sticks on the back of his clothes as if he had been lying down in the woods. 



‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Tom hissed, looking around at the rest of us, ‚Äúwhat the hell was that about?‚Äù 


‚ÄúI dunno‚Äù Dick slurred drunkenly, a menacing glint in his eyes ‚Äúbut he better not show up at our camp again if he knows what‚Äôs good for him‚Äù 


‚ÄúOkay Dick, calm down‚Äù Harry said placatingly. He‚Äôs probably just lonely. 


‚ÄúLonely my ass‚Äù Dick muttered darkly. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something wrong about that guy.‚Äù 


I didn‚Äôt speak, but I knew what he meant. I couldn‚Äôt put a finger on it, but something about Dave had been extremely wrong in a subtle way. Not just an awkward dude who didn‚Äôt understand social norms, but genuinely wrong. 


‚ÄúDid any of you guys notice he never blinked?‚Äù Tom asked after a moment's pause, and I realized he was right, in all the time he had sat in that smoke. He hadn‚Äôt blinked once. 


Hours passed as the fire burned down and the beer drained away, eventually leaving me alone in the early morning dark. Tom and Dick had hit the booze hardest and gone to bed hours ago and Harry had just left to brush his teeth at the small cinderblock bathroom a little ways across the camping area. I would have gone with him, but somehow I didn‚Äôt want to leave the camp unguarded with weird Dave around. 


So I was relieved when Harry came walking back into camp. Then, as he got close, I noticed how pale he was, as pale as a ghost. 


‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù I asked, jumping to my feet, and grabbed his arm to steady him. 


‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he muttered, ‚Äújust saw something weird is all‚Äù


‚ÄúDave?‚Äù I asked, pointedly looking around as if expecting to see him grinning from the wood line. 


‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Harry asked confused, then seemed to shake himself, ‚ÄúNo, nothing like that, it was some kind of animal, I think. I just caught a glimpse of it as it ran across the road. But it looked wrong,‚Äù I tried to push, but he wouldn‚Äôt or couldn‚Äôt explain more, and eventually I let him go to bed and started making my own way towards the bathroom. I carried my big flashlight with me in case I saw whatever had spooked Harry and played it around the campsites as I walked. A few tents and a couple RVs were dotted around, but mostly the site was deserted, unusual because this was a holiday. 


Then I saw it. Running across the road, maybe 20 yards in front of me, at first I thought it was a dog, but it didn‚Äôt move right. I swung my flashlight around and managed to catch just a momentary view of it, and I understood why Harry had looked so scared. It was about the size of a large dog and hairless. That wasn‚Äôt the creepy part; the creepy part was how it moved, almost spider-like. Startled, I stepped back, almost tripping when I felt a hand catch my elbow and steady me. It was Dave. 


‚ÄúHey, watch your feet. Don‚Äôt want you getting hurt!‚Äù This close, I noticed a few things about him, one was that his eyes were not only unblinking but dull and unfocused. Immediately, my mind went to drugs, which would also explain his odd behavior. The other thing I noticed was how cold his skin was. It was a warm night, but he seemed almost chilled. 

‚ÄúHey, uh‚Ä¶ thanks,‚Äù I stammered, straightening myself. Before I turned back and ran the flashlight across the road. 


‚ÄúDid you see that animal?‚Äù I asked Dave, not for any reason but because it was easier than standing there with him in silence. Less creepy. 


Or so I thought until he answered, saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not an animal‚Äù in a warning, almost urgent voice. There was something in his eyes that had not been there before, but only for an instant before the dull look returned


‚ÄúNot an animal,‚Äù I stammered, ‚Äúthen what is it?‚Äù It had looked like, I don‚Äôt know what. Pink and fleshy was all I could say for sure. 


‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Dave said cheerfully ‚Äúbut if it damages your friends vehicle my company offers a great deal on all inclusive insurance if you bundle your home and auto policies with us‚Äù his grin shone white in the moonlight, as he made the rambling sales pitch and I had had enough of him. So, turning, I just walked away down the road. I made it to the bathroom and brushed my teeth, but when I went to leave the building and head back to camp, to my horror, Dave was standing right outside the door.


He didn‚Äôt say anything, just smiled at me, unmoving. In the light from the bathroom, I got a better view of him now, and instantly noticed that he seemed somehow bulkier than before. As if he had gained weight around his midsection. But that didn‚Äôt make sense, it had to be a trick of the light or something tied around his wrist under his shirt, perhaps. 


‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your problem!?‚Äù I shouted, fear creeping into my voice now. 


‚ÄúNo problems, we at Polidyne make insurance easy,‚Äù he spoke with the same faux-friendly salesman's voice as before, but he sounded different. Sluggish and slurring his words, almost drunk. I was sure then that he was on drugs. Angrily, I just pushed past him, walking back to my camp. When I got there, I crawled into my sleeping bag and went to sleep. 


It was probably around 2 am when I fell asleep, so I didn‚Äôt wake up until close to noon. When I did, I found the rest of my friends already up and nursing hangovers. 


Surprisingly I felt fine, I hadn‚Äôt gone as hard as Dick last night but I had kept up with the others fine. We had a full day in the park, and then one more night before we drove back, and despite how weird the whole situation with Dave had been, I was determined to make the best of it. 


‚ÄúSo, guys, what do you want to do?‚Äù 


‚ÄúHead down to the lake?‚Äù Harry asked, gesturing with his chin towards a path leading into the woods a little way from our tent. 


‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather hike up the mountain,‚Äù Tom said, shrugging, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm good with whatever.‚Äù 

Dick just grunted, and took a deep pull from a coffee mug. 


A little worried after everything that had happened yesterday, I got the guys to help me load all our valuables into the locked car, and then we set off for the lake. It was actually three lakes, one roughly V-shaped and the other two like ‚ÄúI‚Äùs they appeared from a distance, almost like four claw marks in the earth. Which I supposed was why they were called the Bear Claw Lakes. They were cool and emerald green, reflecting the colors of the trees and sky and sparkling in the sun. The sort of place that makes you want to jump in and swim from just the sight of it. 


We spent a great few hours messing around, jumping off the rocks, and pushing each other in, and although around 4 pm, it started to lose its luster, it would have been a great day had it ended there. Tired, we began to make our way back up the winding trail to the campsite. 


The campsite had been completely trashed, as we stood dumbfounded where the fire had been the night before, and looked around at the slashed tent and upturned cooler. 


‚ÄúShould we call the Rangers?‚Äù Harry wondered aloud


‚ÄúNo cell reception out here, we‚Äôll have to drive‚Äù Tom said absently crouching down to examine a rip in one of the tents. 


‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna kill that damned salesman!‚Äù Dick yelled, kicking an empty can into the woods out of frustration. 


It wasn‚Äôt just Dick, everyone immediately blamed Dave, even Harry, who always assumed the best about everyone, but somehow I didn‚Äôt think so. The image of that pink fleshy thing the night before, I couldn‚Äôt get it out of my mind. It hadn‚Äôt been a dog, and I think Dave had been right about it not being an animal either. At least not a ‚Äúwild‚Äù animal. I had only caught a glimpse of it, but what it had looked like to me was a person‚Ä¶


A person moving on all fours with something seriously wrong with their joints. I had never been superstitious, but something about that‚Ä¶ thing had given me the heebie-jeebies in a way that had grown stronger the more time passed since I‚Äôd seen it.  


And that‚Äôs when I noticed the‚Ä¶ thing, I don‚Äôt know what to call it, hanging from the tree. It was made from a beer can taken from our cooler, the metal cut and flattened out like a sheet of paper, then folded origami style into a small figure of a man, his limbs bent at odd angles. He was tied with twine at the center of a triangle of sticks and hung from the nearest tree to the campsite, slowly twisting back and forth in the breeze, the metal glinting in the light of the evening sun. 


The thought of finding and confronting Dave flashed through my mind, but what would be the point? 


‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just go, guys,‚Äù I said, pointing towards Tom‚Äôs car. They all nodded clearly, uncomfortable to spend any more time here.  


When we all climbed into the car, it wouldn‚Äôt start. Now, in a story, this is where everyone would have panicked, but there had been a few other campers around this morning, and whatever was wrong, we all assumed it could be fixed. Or at least that we could get a ride to a mechanic. So we didn‚Äôt worry much as we opened the hood to check the engine. 


The battery was missing, and looking under the car, we found the fuel line had been cut,  or on closer inspection, seemingly chewed through by something. So leaving Tom and Dick to work on the car, and watch what was left of our stuff. Harry and I went to find another camper who could help us. 


But there were none, the campsite was completely deserted now. With all the other guests seemingly having left while we were at the lake. 


Both of us tried to rationalize and make excuses, but we both knew something was deeply wrong. 


It was getting late by then, and none of us had cellphones to try and call out. Even if we did, I doubt there would have been reception out where we were. So reluctantly, we made the choice to spend the night in the car and try to hike out in the morning. 


They all thought Dave was a psycho who was messing with us now, I still couldn‚Äôt shake that thing from my mind. Neither could Harry, who admitted to similar feelings when I questioned him. Though his suspicions still lay with whoever or whatever Dave was. I couldn‚Äôt blame him; from what he said, I gathered he hadn‚Äôt gotten as clear a view of that thing as I had. 


The sun set, and the night came in like a blanket, almost calm until around 10 o‚Äôclock, an ear-splitting scream broke the stillness of the night. It was a man‚Äôs voice, clearly in extreme pain, yelling and crying wordlessly, it seemed to go on for an hour, though it was only about 5 minutes, and then silence returned to smother us. 


‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù Tom hissed, looking around at us, just a pair of wide eyes in the dark. 


Nobody answered for a long moment until Dick exhaled a long breath and whispered ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got to find them, they‚Äôre hurt‚Äù 


‚ÄúYeah, we can‚Äôt leave someone out there injured with that psycho.‚Äù Harry‚Äôs voice was shaky with nerves, he was clearly fighting to suppress. 


‚ÄúBad idea,‚Äù my voice was definite, and Tom agreed with me, but I could already tell they weren‚Äôt going to be dissuaded. So I did the good thing as a friend, and I ran after them. A choice I would regret for the rest of my life. 



We slowly made our way through the trees, our flashlights playing around the woods looking for anything out of the ordinary. When we found it, or more specifically, him. Dave was lying in a clearing about ten feet from the edge of the woods, his face twisted in a mask of pain. His stomach was split in a ragged line from chest to crotch with blood pooling around the corpse. 



‚ÄúIt opened him up‚Ä¶‚Äù Harry said in a hollow voice


But among this scene of terror, one thing hit me with a sense of pure revulsion stronger than I have ever felt. Leading away from him in the blood were dozens of small twisted human tracks, from what looked like very young children crawling on all fours. 


‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get out of here,‚Äù I mumbled, stepping back from the clearing. As I stepped back, I raised my light a few inches and caught something across the clearing like a baby with a broken back standing on its hands and feet splayed out, insect-like beside it. Its hands and feet turned the wrong way, then as I watched, it raised its little head, mouth dripping with gore, and began to cry. 



Next thing I remember I was running, Dick‚Äôs heavy feet pounding the ground right on my heels as I sprinted headlong through the woods. Bursting into the clearing, my foot caught on a branch, and I fell hard, feeling something in my wrist break. I forced myself to my feet and kept running for the car Dick reached it and flung open the door leaping in, and I reached it moments after. Holding my arm as pain lanced through me, I turned to look behind me for Harry, but he was nowhere to be seen.



‚ÄúGet in!‚Äù Dick hissed, his tone bordering on hysterical. I wasn‚Äôt listening, I couldn‚Äôt abandon Harry, I wouldn‚Äôt!



‚ÄúHarry!‚Äù I yelled, looking around desperately for any sign of him, but nothing. Not even the sound of nighttime animals, and finally defeated, I climbed back into the car.


Dick was sobbing, and my breath was coming in sharp pained breaths 



‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Tom almost screamed turning to look from me to Dick and back again. He got no answer instead Dick swore slamming his fist into the back of the seat gripped by some type of panicked fit, and I was pretty sure I was about to throw up.  



‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù He was fully screaming now: a mix of fear and anger etched on his face as he looked from me to Dick. 



‚ÄúSomething, got Harry.‚Äù I managed to hiss out between clenched teeth. 



‚ÄúYou left him?!‚Äù Tom  spluttered, clearly not getting how bad the situation was



‚ÄúOpened. Him. Up.‚Äù We all went silent like a switch had been thrown, at the faint sound of Harry‚Äôs voice, but it wasn‚Äôt right, it was oddly blank and toneless, and the delivery was stilted and awkward. Turning, I could see him at the edge of the clearing holding his stomach as if he were about to be sick, then he seemed to shake himself and stand up straight, walking closer, I could faintly hear him mumble, ‚ÄúOpened. Up‚Äù 



Wordlessly and almost without thought, I found myself leaning forward and fumbling for the door lock in the front seat. 



‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù Tom hissed, sounding scandalized at my actions 



‚ÄúOpen. Up,‚Äù He said, walking up to the car window and leaning down to look in like a cop writing us a ticket, only he was wearing a dirty shirt and smiling like something was physically pulling back his cheeks. ‚ÄúOpen up,‚Äù He spoke again, almost naturally


Tom reached across for the lock, but found himself pinned by Dick who held his arm to the dash, crouched forward and shaking. He had a wild, half-crazed look in his eyes, and his voice was faint and breathless as he whispered, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not him, man.‚Äù 


‚ÄúCommmme onnn guyys,‚Äù Harry slurred these words from outside the window, then seemed to shift as he finished ‚Äúopen up.‚Äù His tone now totally natural, then he repeated, ‚ÄúCome on, guys, open up.‚Äù Almost perfectly natural, calm, and cheerful as he stared unblinkingly into the window. 


A long few minutes passed as we sat frozen, the thing that used to be our friend calmly looking in, as we waited. His speech grew more natural, and he started to talk coherently. 


‚ÄúReal funny joke guys, but come on now. Just let me in.‚Äù 


‚ÄúLet me in‚Äù He began to chant, growing more frantic with every repetition, that death mask grin never slipping an inch as he started to shout. 


‚ÄúLet me in‚Äù 


‚ÄúLet me in.‚Äù


‚ÄúLet me in!‚Äù 


‚ÄúLET ME IN!‚Äù On the final sound, he made a noise between a laugh and a scream and began to beat his head against the door until red blood ran down the glass. Then for an instant he looked confused, the smile finally falling from his face as he mouthed one word clearly through the glass, an instant later the smile was back and wider than before, muscles on his neck stood out and began to twitch under the strain as he fell back and began to writhe on the ground as if having a seizure. The word that he mouthed to us in that moment of clarity was ‚ÄúRun.‚Äù 


We all listened to our friend for the last time and scrambled out the doors on the far side of the car. Bolting for the direction of the access road that led out of the park. Or at least I thought we all did, but as I reached the last turn before the car would be out of sight and glanced back, I saw Tom on the ground, and something white, naked, and fleshy forcing itself into his mouth while Harry held him down. 



My feet pounded into the gravel road, and my chest burned with overexertion. The pure fire of adrenaline sang in my veins, pushing me beyond what I could do and into an area where I risked hurting myself if I continued, but I didn‚Äôt care. Dick was a few feet ahead of me head down and sprinting for his life as we passed the dark silhouette of the bathhouse and rushed towards the entrance of the campsite. 


We stumbled to a stop realizing we were not alone, a figure was crouched in the middle of the entrance, its head cocked like a curious animal as it watched us. The shadows of the trees played a camouflage pattern of dark and light across its pale, sagging skin, and a long pink tongue lolled from its grinning mouth and over one of its eyes, Its head was twisted so that they looked out from beneath the mouth, and a mane of dark wild hair fell from that to the ground. It didn‚Äôt move, just sat watching us. 

Dick didn‚Äôt say anything, just sank to his feet and began to quietly sob. I looked around for an escape and saw Tom and Harry standing behind us, slowly walking forward. Harry with a natural gait, while Tom limped and spasmed unnaturally, though even as I watched seemed to grow more coordinated. 



‚ÄúCome on we‚Äôve gotta go‚Äù I hissed trying to pull dick to his feet, but he had always been larger than me, and limp as he was it was like lifting a sack of wet dirt. 



‚ÄúWake me up,‚Äù He muttered incoherently as I tried to pull him to his feet, but all I managed to do was overbalance both of us, and we fell to the roadbed. The pain of landing again on my broken arm caused a galaxy of stars to explode inside my head. White hot lines of anger lancing up my arm and into my chest, but I didn‚Äôt have time to pass out. So I forced myself to my feet, swaying drunkenly as I tried to catch my breath. Tom and Harry were closer now, though the beast still watched silently, its crooked head giving off an almost bored energy. 



‚ÄúDick we have to go!‚Äù I shouted in his ear, but he didn‚Äôt react or seem to hear me. There was one last thing I could think to do, so I pulled back my leg and kicked him hard in the mouth. There was a crunch, and blood poured from broken teeth, but through the pain and confusion in his eyes, I could see his mind return. ‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù I shouted, grabbing for his arm with my good hand. Slowly, he pulled himself to his feet, almost bringing me down again, but we stood, and after a moment of unsteadiness began to move towards the edge of the woods. At first limping and then stumbling and finally running, we crashed through the underbrush, my mind using the pain of twigs slashing at my face to refocus itself. 



Eventually, exhaustion, aided by the realization that we were hopelessly lost, forced us to stop and take stock of where we were. We were alone in a tree-shaded hollow formed by two moss-covered boulders leaning against each other. Shaking from exertion, I leaned against one and slid to the ground, letting its cool surface ground me in reality. 



‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù Dick asked after a long time of tense silence. 


‚ÄúI, don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I wheezed, my chest still burning and my heart racing like I was about to die from the wild run in the dark, far more exercise than I was used to. Hysterically, a useless part of my mind promised to buy a treadmill if I ever lived the rest of my mind condemning it for wasting time, which was equally useless in our situation.



‚ÄúWe‚Äôre miles from t‚Äôroad.‚Äù His voice was sluggish and whistled oddly through the broken teeth as he talked. It was clear that even the few words he had said were torture for him, and I felt a stab of guilt go through me.  



‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I started, but he cut me off with a shake of his head 



‚ÄúNot impor-tant.‚Äù his slurred voice turning the syllables into separate words. Then he glanced around at the thick trees, instantly my body tensed, ready to resume our run, but walking over to a large pine, whose lower few feet were scarred by the horns of deer. 



‚ÄúLook for road,‚Äù He mumbled, pointing up at the tree, and testing a deep gouge for footing as he spoke. 

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I hissed, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not safe.‚Äù He responded with a painful sound that I think was supposed to be a laugh. Slowly, he pulled himself up until he could reach a branch. Unsteadily, he yanked himself onto it before pausing a moment to catch his breath, then repeated the process, moving higher. I should be the one to climb; I was smaller and lighter, but with my broken wrist, I could never make it off the ground. Slowly, I watched as he faded into the shadow of the upper branches. The occasional grunt of effort and the swaying of the pine, the only indications that he was still on this planet. 



‚ÄúWhat are. You doing?‚Äù Came a toneless choppy voice from behind me, and spinning on my feet, I saw him. 



Tom was standing a few feet away, smiling like the Cheshire Cat, his unblinking eyes slowly moving from me to the tree and back. 



My back was to the boulder, and the thing that used to be my friend was in front of me. I had nowhere to go, and the fear and exhaustion seemed to fade as a sudden calm flowed from somewhere within me. The realization that I was about to die was freeing, in an unpleasant way. 



‚ÄúWhat are you going to do?‚Äù Tom asked his voice somewhere between a robot and a mocking tone. It enraged me to hear this thing, this monster pretend to be my friend. So as it lunged, I shifted to the side and pushed off with my feet. My broken wrist was crushed against the rock, and for maybe half a second, my world went dark. 



As my eyes focused, I watched the twisted-Tom-thing‚Äôs head smash into the rock, its neck turning at an angle with a sickening crack like firewood. It seemed to shake spasmodically as it collapsed into a limp heap at the base of the rock, and to my shock, I saw tears in his dying eyes. 



Then he screamed.



‚ÄúJohn, run!‚Äù Dick was a few branches us now, and he screamed for me to run. But it made no sense. Why should I run? The feeling in my arm had gone beyond pain into some new, indescribable sensation, and the cool ground felt good against my face. Running would require an effort I simply did not possess. Almost lazily, my eyes drifted to Tom, and I tried to focus on him. Something was happening; his crumpled form seemed to twist from within, as blood began to stain his shirt. 



Dick leapt from the bottom branch to the ground throwing up a cloud of leaves, I heard a sound of pain, limping over he grabbed me, and as I had done to him before, he screamed for me to run. I couldn‚Äôt, my eyes refused to leave Tom. A burst of blood and some other fluid gushed from the wound to mingle on the ground as a dozen little things spilled out from under his shirt. They were twisted, half-formed abortions that screamed with a wailing cry as they flopped on the ground. Even so, this close, I could tell that they were baby versions of the twisted man-thing that I had seen the previous night, and had again blocked our way to the road.  



I remember that I screamed, but nothing after that for a span of minutes at least. Next thing I know for sure, that isn‚Äôt an image or sound disjointed from context in my mind, is that I was running through the dark woods, or quickly limping at least. I had an arm around Dick‚Äôs shoulder, and somehow I knew he had hurt his ankle jumping from the tree, though I couldn‚Äôt remember how. There was a knife-sharp line between seeing the dying baby things and now, where I knew I had lost time in between. It didn‚Äôt matter. Tom was dead, really dead, and as I stumbled through the trees, I had to fight to not let the grief overwhelm me. He had been my friend, but like Harry, he was gone‚Ä¶



Dick had seen the road close to where we were when he reached the top of the tree, and we were limping now towards it. Some distance behind us, I heard the sound of a‚Ä¶ thing running full sprint through the woods. It was getting closer, but we couldn‚Äôt move any faster. Dick‚Äôs feet slipped, and his weight caught me and soon we were both falling, we hit the ground and rolled into something cool and wet. 


A creekbed, some small voice in my mind observed. I couldn‚Äôt even feel pain at that point, it was as if my nerves had burned away, just a distant sensation of wrongness told me how bad my arm was. Shifting from where I lay, I stared up. There was something warm in my eyes, and they were having trouble focusing. Still atop the bank, I could see the form of Harry smiling down at us. His shirt hung open, revealing the swollen flesh below, pregnant with more of the nascent things that grew in blood and pus. 



‚ÄúTom opened up too soon,‚Äù He said matter-of-factly, but nothing was making sense anymore. I felt stunned, I felt disconnected, I felt high‚Ä¶ I felt like my mind had broken under the weight of all I had seen, and I was analytically watching myself go insane from behind my own eyes. I didn‚Äôt care.



Dick screamed, a feral inhuman sound and flung a rock at the Harry-thing‚Äôs head, it impacted with a thud and left a visible dent, but it didn‚Äôt flinch as the rock bounced away. Still Dick roared, until the rough sound of it made me sure he was damaging his throat, hurling anything he could reach in a frantic attempt to die fighting. I only shuddered quietly as I willed myself to my feet. Harry‚Äôs movements grew unsteady as Dick‚Äôs projectiles did damage to his dying‚Ä¶ his dead body. 


I knew it was too late, I half walked, half fell up the other bank of the creek, my feet on autopilot as my eyes tried to focus on a gap in the brush where I could see a red, reflective stop sign. Two screams followed each other in quick succession behind me, one I knew to be Harry finally hatching, I could only hope that Dick had killed him, and caused the things to spew out prematurely like with Tom for a moment, because the hoarse sound of Dick‚Äôs final wail dispelled any hope. I could hear them gurgling behind me, like the random sounds of an infant and the chittering of an insect as I stumbled towards the stop sign, towards salvation. 



Beyond them, I heard another sound, a deep guttural growl that I could only assume was coming from some older, darker thing. I didn‚Äôt care, if I could reach the red sign, I would be fine. It glowed like a beacon even as the roar got louder. Then there was a squeal, high-pitched and unmistakably manmade, before everything went dark. 


The driver‚Äôs panicked voice as she fussed over me blurs into the sound of the paramedic shouting numbers as I was wheeled under some artificial light. A confusing slide show of disjointed images and words is all I have for what feels like a long time after that.



‚ÄúBlood loss.‚Äù A dark figure looks down at me, momentarily blocking the light



‚ÄúSevere concussion.‚Äù A stabbing pain, then a feeling of cool numbness flowing from it



‚ÄúHave to-‚Äù Sweet, narcotic darkness‚Ä¶



I woke days later, in the county hospital, confused and in pain. They had taken my arm, they had taken my friends. I was alone. 



The police came later, time still wasn‚Äôt making sense, and asked more questions than I could keep track of. It took a while before I understood that they suspected I had killed my friends. I guess technically, I had killed Tom at least. Or had I? 

No!  That thing with the twisted head, the mother of all those foul infants, it was the killer, the monster, the demon. 


Eventually, they went away, and I learned later that the investigation had been dropped after the coroner examined the bodies. He killed himself, I think. Nothing much made sense for a long time, everything was still a blur of doctors and nurses and cops and people I don‚Äôt remember flitting in and out of my memory like ghosts. Ghosts, I am haunted by ghosts, my oldest and best friends taken from me by whatever that was. 


Eventually, my mind almost began to work again, and the doctors sounded less worried when they spoke about me. A few weeks more and they released me to go home. I called a cab. 



It drove me from the hospital up my driveway and stopped in front of my house, then it left and took me to the ferry terminal, where with just the clothes on my back, I purchased a ticket and left the island I had lived on all my life‚Ä¶ Hanging over my garage from rusty tacks I used to hold up Christmas lights were three little metal figures, twisting in the wind‚Ä¶

1ltcr8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1ltcr8i/how_to_make_cold_brew_coffee_in_a_mason_jar/,How to make cold brew coffee in a mason jar?,"As a coffee lover, I've always enjoyed experimenting with different brewing methods. Recently, I've been obsessed with cold brew coffee, and I've found that making it in a mason jar is not only easy but also incredibly delicious. Let me share my process with you.

First, you'll need coarsely ground coffee beans. I prefer a dark roast for a richer flavor, but you can use any type you like. For every cup of water, use about 1/4 cup of ground coffee. This ratio gives me the perfect strength, but feel free to adjust it to your taste.

Next, add the coffee grounds to your mason jar. Pour in room temperature or cold water, making sure all the grounds are fully submerged. Stir gently to ensure everything is mixed well.

Now comes the waiting game. Seal the jar tightly and let it sit at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours. The longer it steeps, the stronger the flavor will be. I usually leave mine for about 18 hours.

After steeping, it's time to strain the coffee. You can use a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth or a paper coffee filter. Slowly pour the mixture through the strainer into another clean jar or container. This process might take a few minutes, but be patient ‚Äì it's worth it!

What you're left with is a smooth, concentrated cold brew that you can store in the fridge for up to two weeks. When you're ready to drink it, dilute it with water or milk to your preferred strength and add ice if desired.

One thing I love about this method is its simplicity. You don't need any fancy equipment ‚Äì just a mason jar and some basic kitchen items. However, if you find yourself making cold brew often, you might want to invest in a dedicated cold brew maker. I recently got one from https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers and it's been a game-changer for my daily coffee routine.

Cold brew coffee has a smoother, less acidic taste compared to regular iced coffee. It's perfect for hot summer days or when you want a refreshing caffeine boost without the bitterness. Plus, you can use it as a base for all sorts of coffee drinks ‚Äì from simple iced lattes to more elaborate concoctions.

If you're looking to step up your cold brew game, there are lots of variations you can try. Add a cinnamon stick or vanilla bean to the jar while steeping for extra flavor. Or try using different types of coffee beans to discover new taste profiles.

Remember, the key to great cold brew is patience and quality ingredients. Don't rush the process, and use the best coffee beans you can afford. And if you're ready to take your iced coffee making to the next level, check out the great selection of cold brew makers at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They've got some fantastic options that can make the process even easier and more enjoyable.

Whether you stick with the mason jar method or decide to upgrade your equipment, making cold brew at home is a fun and rewarding experience. It's a great way to save money on coffee shop drinks and customize your brew exactly how you like it. Give it a try ‚Äì I'm sure you'll be hooked just like I am!",1,1751837714.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Also, if I don‚Äôt constantly drink water throughout the day, the pain comes back. I drink a lot of water before bed to try to prevent the discomfort in the morning but it hasnt helped.
I don‚Äôt drink pop, but I do usually have 1 coffee. I‚Äôve cut back on this to see if it helps and so far it hasn‚Äôt lol. 
I‚Äôve also tried electrolytes the past few weeks to see if it will help me retain water.

1ltcnn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1ltcnn8/ideas_for_improvement/,Ideas for Improvement,"  
Recently an idea popped into my head: What if there was a gamemode like hide and seek?  
You have a maximum of 5 players, 1 seeker and the rest hiders.  
The players turn into momos and can select a momo cloak from their wardrobe or a random one (even those you don't own).  
Now the hider momos need to find their hiding spot within a short time frame and then the seeker can go and find them.  
This can be done in smaller limited areas.  
For example, in the town of Florawish, there should be more than enough hiding spots for momos.  
Of course, the bell and the indicator on the map for coop should be removed from this gamemode.  
  
Another idea I had was private fashion shows.  
Imagine inviting your friends to a private fashion show, being able to select the style and attributes of the show and then judging the outfits they throw together in a short timeframe.  
This could also tie in with the housing we might get in the future by allowing us to put up a little stage in our home, invite over our friends and do a runway show.  
  
After having finished all the missions and having gathered all the collectibles in the game, there really isn't much to do, so I thought of 2 things I would like to see.  
A daily rotating mini-dungeon in which you need to utilize your ability outfits.  
For example, a platformer mini dungeon that makes you utilize the shrinking outfit and cannon launch mechanic or a wind tunnel making use of your gliding outfits, having you dodge incoming objects.  
  
Having done everything also makes the world feel empty and this is where the second idea comes in.  
Random world events would be small events that occur at random, caused by the player being close by.

For example, teleporting to a warp spire has a chance to trigger an attack by esslings trying to corrupt the warp spire.  
Another example would be random attacks on NPCs.  
These events would in turn reward small amounts of materials plus the gains from defeating the esslings.  
  
Infinity Nikki is an extremely fun game that suffers from a big problem: lack of replayability.  
Once you have done everything, there isn't much you can do.  
Farming bling/thread/insight is the only thing you can really do and even then it's limited.  
Dressing up your Nikki in cute clothes and taking pictures can also only extend your playtime by a few hours each week.  
  
I believe that Infinity Nikki's future depends on interactability and replayability.  
We need a lot more ways to interact with each other.  
The social aspect of this game needs a lot more attention as it could be a major reason for people to continue playing the game.  
Some of the most fun I had was with another Nikki, doing random things and taking pictures.  
I stop at every single hourglass I see, look at the picture, leave a like and sometimes, if I have a good idea, even take a picture together with them.  
But we are currently extremely limited to what we can do and how we can interact with each other, and not just interact with each other.  
NPCs would be a great way to breathe fresh air into the game.  
Allowing us to hold hands with a NPC and 'kidnap' them to take pictures with them would be awesome.  
Many of us have probably thought about doing exactly that many times and wished it was something you could do.  
I know I would¬†take NPCs all over the world and take tons of pictures with them.  
A coffee date with Dada, riding the paper crane with Nonoy or skipping work with Tan Youyou. All of these would be really fun to do and take pictures of.  
Also, it would be amazing if we had a mirror in the sea of stars we could go to and replay story chapters.  
Many miss the older characters that rarely appear or are¬†gone. The best example of this would be Giovanni or Ena.

All the things I wrote down could even be monetized, or they could advertise already existing products.  
Hide and seek would be advertising momo cloaks, which can be gained by pulling on the limited banner and gained through some other shop purchases.

Fashion shows could advertise the dye system by making all dye options free during the show, and they could even sell different stage backgrounds in bundles for a cheap price.

If you were able to bring home NPCs, it would be a great advertisement for the housing system and would lead more people to spend time and money on improving it.  
If even just 1% of the player base would buy a product each month for each of these reasons, it would be reasonable to expect a great return on investment, with barely any upkeep cost and adding new products being very easy, it should pose no problem to add these suggestions.  
I have already sent these suggestions to Infold and hope they will consider at least some of what I have written down.

I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas on how to improve the game and what you would like to see in upcoming versions.

1ltcli7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyScienceFiction/comments/1ltcli7/its_been_a_while/,It's been a while.,"Today is cold. We finally had a frost, I walked around the back of the house in my underwear and flipflops to rest my hand on the cool ice that had formed on the roof of the car, it was cold hard and dry. A strange sensation, winter finally managed to do it's thing. It won't last though it will will be gone in a few hours. My teeth hurt. I walk back inside. 

The kettle flicks off, again, I reshuffle the fucking thing and the light comes back oon then goes off again. Fucking damn thing. The stupid bastard had parked the kettle on a hot stove element. Jesus what a fucking idiot. So yeah, the kettle is now slightly fucked. Thanks a bunch. I jiggle it a fraction adn it clicks back on. I watch it. The water roars and bubbles. I spoon raw coffee into the steel cup. 

Back in my sleeping tube I wrap myself up and warm back up. It's quite fresh and crisp, the air is clear. I drag the compuwrite over from the stool and rest it on my lap. The keys feel clecky and plastic compared with my portable word processor. Silence. I ponder the future, again. 

The four wheel drive is parked in the garage. It's a great garage, concrete floor and dry and well lit and well everything that my garage is not. I like the garage. I sigh. I can't take the garage with me. I look at the vehicle and work out how to open the engine bay hatch. It's a thick wire poking out of the engine cooling system. The bonnet makes a low squeak and drags as it opens, i find the stalk that holds it up and click it into the hole. The motor is there, it looks new. Clean. Fine. I am in luck again. 

I got stuck in a muddy part of the track. An idiot mistake but now I am truly fucked. I swear and kick myself. You fucking idiot. I get out and look at the mud sprayed up and back from the wheels. What to do now ?  I have no spade, nor sand, nor matts, no winch... shit. I messed up.  I start to panic a bit. This is not ok. Where is my rifle? This is just the place to get jumped. There it is half under my day pack full of cans. Check the magazine, check the bullets are stacked ok, pull the things back and let one strip off the deck. Like dealing cards. It makes all the right clicks and metallic scrapes. On th engine cover it sits. Ready if I need to grab it. Maybe I should get a sling. Mental notes are falllign out of my head now. I need to write things down. I look at the wheels buried up to the hubs in the mud. Shit. 

I got out of the jam when I lost my shit and just hit the gas and started to spin the steering wheel left and right as violently as possible. Then I added in some forward and reverse, to my surprise I find I was gaining some advancement every small amount, this was the key, not to give up. Suddenly tthe tyres started to make traction. Like stirring thick glue, they gripped everso slightly more. Then it climbed out of the hole and lurched forwards swimming though the thick as shit mud. We are making it. Fuck,  I had left the rifle on the engine cowling. It is sliding off, then it sticks on the balance and fails to fall off. I slowly crawl forwards and steer onto the harder part of the track. I am free.  Let's get out of here. Take me home country road...

You got to stop and take a shit. Or hold on till im somewhere safe. It's the least of my concerns but it's kind of annoying. Where is the bog roll. Ok here is a safe spot, out in the open with no cover. Or do is it better to stop in a clump of bush ? I decided to stop where I can see better. At least I can see them coming from a ways off. I drag the spade out, force of habit, dig a hole and hide your shit. Never mind the fresh vehicle tracks. Some ideas of decorum still hang on. I take the rifle. Walk a ways from the machine. 

Do we clean our hands anymore? I remember soap. It has a smell. Not burnt oil, or sweat or shit or rotting carcase. and hot water. I have a pleasant recollection of endless hot water. So many many months ago. Life has changed. and clean skinwear. We had it all. We let it go. Shut up and get moving. 

It's time to go. Move out team I mumble to myself. We all end up playing soldiers in this part. The fizzing wizz warble of a near miss. and the duck even though it's way too late. Maybe they fire two round burst, or some shit. I didn't read the manual that closely. Too late to read it now.

1ltcf82,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1ltcf82/daytime_sleepiness_with_mad/,Daytime sleepiness with MAD,"I‚Äôm a slim woman with very mild OSA. I wore a cpap from March 2019‚ÄìFebruary 2025. Towards the end of my cpap time, I started getting really bad GERD and air getting trapped in my stomach. (It‚Äôs hard to explain that you‚Äôre late for work because you had to fart and burp out all the air that was forced down your nose overnight.)

In March I got a septoplasty. (My surgeon said he didn‚Äôt know how any air got up my left nostril.) Breathing through my nose has been AMAZING. Truly addictive. I couldn‚Äôt wear cpap immediately after surgery, so I slept propped up. I‚Äôd been fitted for a MAD before septo and started wearing it in late April. Things were great at first. It‚Äôs been really really nice not to travel with that giant machine, worry about how much distilled water I have, or deal with respiratory illnesses. 

In May I started getting some TMJ problems. I chose to power through it. My apnea was almost gone. In June the TMJ problems went away so I advanced it again at the advice of my dentist to get rid of that last bit of apnea. (I‚Äôm currently at 1.) This is when I started experiencing extreme dry mouth. Soon after daytime sleepiness started up. The TMJ issues came back worse than before. I got a Botox shot in my jaw last week from my dermatologist who said my TMJ didn‚Äôt seem so bad when I bit down. I told him about the MAD and he said my temporalis muscle was pretty tight. 

The Botox helped a bit. The dry mouth is slowly subsiding‚Äîwhen I wake up early because of it, I have a hard time falling asleep again. But sleep quality and daytime tiredness keep hitting me. Last night I slept ~1pm to a little before 9am. I woke up feeling pretty good, but for the past few hours I feel extremely lethargic. If I hadn‚Äôt drank a bunch of coffee and a 12oz Red Bull, and taken 20mg of vyvanse (I have a prescription!), I would be able to sleep if I closed my eyes. Hell, I might even be able to sleep even after ingesting that stuff. My jaw feels achy. I had a headache earlier. 

I know it takes a while to adjust to a MAD, but am I cooked? I‚Äôm going to speak with my dentist again this week (we do little check-ins) but is this going to get better? Is a MAD just not going to work for me?

Tl;dr: I got a MAD and experienced a somewhat painful adjustment period. I overcame that after a month or so, but now I‚Äôve been having jaw pain (even after Botox) and daytime exhaustion. Has this happened to anyone else?",1,1751836867.0,SleepApnea,0,1.0,False

**Route:** Copenhagen ‚Üí Kangerlussuaq (SFO) ‚Üí Ilulissat (JAV) ‚Üí Nuuk (GOH) ‚Üí Copenhagen  
**Duration:** 6 days



**‚úàÔ∏è Travel Costs**

* Flights: \~7,100 DKK (\~950 EUR) per person (CPH ‚Üí SFO ‚Üí JAV ‚Üí GOH ‚Üí CPH ‚Äî prices were pretty much the same whether we looked one week or six months out)
* Accommodation: \~700 EUR total for two people (Old Camp in Kangerlussuaq, airbnb in Illulisat and Nuuk)
* Tours & Activities: \~650 EUR per person  (Boat tours, short guided hikes, day trips)
* Groceries: \~50 EUR total for two people (We cooked most meals or picked up ready-to-eat stuff)
* Taxis in Nuuk & Ilulissat: \~55 EUR total for two people (Cheaper and more convenient than airport shuttles if you‚Äôre two people travelling on weekend)

**üóìÔ∏è Itinerary**

**Day 1 ‚Äì Arrival in Kangerlussuaq (SFO)**

We flew from Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq with Air Greenland. The flight was delayed by 1.5 hours, but Albatros Arctic Circle waited for us (thankfully, 4 of the 5 passengers on the same tour were on that flight). The Point 660 tour was a good intro ‚Äî about 15 minutes walking on the ice sheet after a long drive (2 hours each way). The guide was solid, the scenery was great, and the bus was freezing ‚Äî layer up.

We stayed overnight at Old Camp ‚Äî basic, clean, and warm.



**Day 2 ‚Äì To Ilulissat + Midnight Iceberg Tour**

After a short flight to Ilulissat, we explored the town and walked the boardwalk to the Icefjord. Stunning views with very little effort.

That night we joined Unique Tours for a midnight boat trip. We wouldn‚Äôt recommend them ‚Äî they nearly left without us, and the process was disorganised. The scenery made up for it, but the experience felt rushed. [Google Review (3 stars)](https://g.co/kgs/bKxFFf3)

**Day 3 ‚Äì Eqi Glacier Tour + Yellow Route Walk**

We booked the Eqi Glacier tour with I Love Ilulissat Tours ‚Äî our most waited tour which became easily the lowest point of the trip. The boat circled for two hours, the captain didn‚Äôt seem to know the route, and we never even got close to the glacier. A waste of time and money. [Google Review (2 stars)](https://g.co/kgs/Jv9rq7c)

Later on that day we did the Yellow Route hike, which was peaceful and absolutely stunning. We had it mostly to ourselves.

**Day 4 ‚Äì Day Trip to Qeqertarsuaq (Disko Island)**

Highlight of the trip. We booked a Disko Line Explorer day trip, which included round-trip transport and dinner at Disko Hotel.

We hiked to Kuannit, passed waterfalls, saw the black sand beach, and still had time to relax before dinner (starter + main ‚Äî pre-selected by the hotel). Everything ran smoothly, and this was much better value than booking just the ferry alone.

**Day 5 ‚Äì Free Day in Ilulissat + Evening Flight to Nuuk**

We left this day open as a buffer in case of delays, which wasn‚Äôt needed (yeey!). We went back to the Icefjord and considered hiking the Blue Route, but turned around after seeing arctic foxes and realising we were totally alone ‚Äî didn‚Äôt feel smart.

In the evening, we flew to Nuuk. We still were energised at 10pm and did a walk to Myggedalen Viewpoint ‚Äî beautiful evening views! 

**Day 6 ‚Äì Nuuk + Return to Copenhagen**

Our flight back was in the afternoon, so we spent the morning walking around Nuuk ‚Äî boardwalk, beach, viewpoints, etc. The city‚Äôs compact and easy to see in a few hours (my opinion, if you're not planning to do any hike or go to the other settlement which we didn't think was necessary after the views around Ilulissat and also our budget)



**üí¨ Personal Observations & Tips**

* Prices for Air Greenland were nearly identical whether we looked months ahead or just a week out. You might save a few euros, but nothing major. As of 2025, this is just what it costs (the trip would have been half the price before Nuuk airport opening, maybe the price once again will go down with Ilulissat airport opening?)
* Booking a combined ticket (e.g., CPH ‚Üí SFO ‚Üí JAV ‚Üí GOH) was cheaper than taking the ferry ‚Äî and saved us time. One odd thing: we booked through a third party and couldn‚Äôt retrieve the ticket until 24 hours before departure, but check-in worked fine.
* Weather delays are common ‚Äî especially in/out of Nuuk. If you‚Äôre planning a loop, it‚Äôs safer to start in Kangerlussuaq.
* Food on international flights is served cold (in our case, chicken breast + potatoes + one cherry tomato (yes, that's funny :D) + bread + brownie + drinks) and domestic flights offer cookies and coffee. 
* Nuuk Transport shuttles cost 95 DKK per person, and not neccesarily timed with flights. Taxis are better for two.If you arrive on a weekday before 5pm, you can use the public bus from the airport ‚Äî it costs just 20 DKK.
* We cooked most of our meals. Prices were close to Denmark, except for fresh produce, which was 2‚Äì3x more expensive. Look for discounts on short-dated items.We also made the most of included meals ‚Äî whether that was dinner on Disko Island, inflight snacks, or breakfast options at guesthouses.
* You might save a little by coming in the shoulder season, but you‚Äôd miss out on the midnight sun and longer days. We were glad to have long daylight hours ‚Äî it gave us more flexibility.
* Tour Summary
   * Albatros Arctic Circle (Kangerlussuaq, 660 Point): Worth it ‚Äî good guide, well-organised.
   * Disko Line Explorer (Qeqertarsuaq): Excellent ‚Äî well-paced, good dinner, great value.
   * Unique Tours (Ilulissat): Not recommended ‚Äî disorganised
   * I Love Ilulissat Tours (Eqi Glacier): Would not recommend ‚Äî we didn‚Äôt even reach the glacier.",5,1751836689.0,greenland,3,1.0,False

This happened today. My husband was watching extremely dramatic anime with the sound turned way up so it basically just sounds like children screaming. I said ""goddamnit, I can't take all this f\*\*\*ing screaming"" instead of communicating my need for quiet in a calm way. A few minutes later, I said ""I'm sorry, babe, I was overstimulated and pre-coffee. I shouldn't have taken it out on you"". Instead of accepting my apology, he went off on me for almost 10 minutes about what an asshole I am for making a big deal of a little noise and ""yucking his yum"" because he loves anime. I already felt badly for speaking to him in an ungentle way, I already apologized, I didn't have anything to offer that was deeper than an apology, so I apologized again. He was still upset.

1ltc7f2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ltc7f2,Emergency Back Up System,"I've finally got all the pieces of my home back up system put together. Generator receptacle and interlock, Ecoflow Delta Pro and 2 batteries, Champion 3400 Dual Fuel generator, and a small AC unit. If the power goes out, I can select critical circuits in the house to power the fridge, outlets for a couple appliances like a coffee pot, lights and ceiling fans in certain rooms. All that stuff together pulls about 300-400 watts which should give me at least a full day and some change on the Delta Pro alone. The Air Conditioner pulls about 1500 watts when the compressor is running, which would give me about 7 hours of AC in my bedroom with the compressor running the whole time. My guess is that at night, I might be able to get 50% on/off with the compressor once the room is cooled down. Assuming that's right, and I'm averaging 700 watts on the AC and add the 300 watts of the other ""critical"" circuits, I might get between 8 and 10 hours just on the battery. 

I have not hooked this up thru my generator receptacle yet to check this out, but plan to this week. I can also run the generator directly into the Delta Pro (as seen in the app screen shot), so at max power draw I might be close to equal power in to power out. I could also plug the generator into the house inlet and recharge the Delta Pro by plugging it into one of the other 110 v plugs in the generator. 

Hopefully I never get to test out how useful this set up is. We've been without power for as long as 10 days due to hurricanes over the years. Our grid has gotten more reliable since then, and most gas stations have generator power and the fuel distribution stations have been hardened to be more reliable than when Hurricane Charlie came thru. But you never know 

My next project is gonna be a solar pergola with something like 4, 400 W panels to help me top off the delta pros without a generator.

Hi, I know this sub is for bikes, but I'm hoping that it extends to locks as well. 

You might have seen me around asking about Electra and Trek cruiser style bikes. Well, I finally got a bike! Not one of the ones I asked about, but a simple little blue Electra cruiser I found off FB Marketplace that was in budget and not being sold by a creepy old man.

I'm learning to brave the strodes on it. Got pretty far away from my house today (for me), and eventually I intend to work up to getting to the library, grocery store and coffee place (all about 2 miles away lol). 

But it's occuring to me that to go to these places, I'm going to have to lock my bike up outside (or just inside the building). Not every place has a bike rack, so I might have to use a pole or something idk. I'm looking into locks but all I see recommended are u-locks (probably for good reason) and that a basic ""cheap"" one is at minimum like $35-40. That is not currently in budget. (Because I bought a damn bike, lol...). Any suggestions?

It was a huge wake up call to realise how much I've hurt them and I feel so sorry. Since we talked about this, communication over text has slowly died down until it was non existent and we haven't seen each other in person in months whereas before we'd see each other every week. One of the things they brought up is that I just talk at them, sharing things I want to talk about and giving updates about my life without leaving space for them so I've been trying to make a point to let them lead conversations and not bombard them with messages but it's just resulted in us not talking. I feel stuck I don't want to go back to leading the conversation and them feeling like I'm talking over them but the silence is lonely and I miss them. Another thing they talked about is that I'm always asking for help without thinking about them, like when they helped me move house or when they helped push my wheelchair or held my hand when I got my first tattoo. They said I get things out of their help but for them they feel like they spent all day being told what to do, or their back hurt from pushing me, or it was a hot day and they had to sit with me for nothing. So at the moment I need help making 360 end of year gifts for the kids at the school I work at and I didn't ask my friend for help because I didn't want to take them for granted. I thought, what would they get out of helping me make gifts for kids they don't even know, so I didn't reach out. I did however still need help so I put on my social media asking if anyone would be interested in coming to my house and making keyrings with me for the school and in return I'd provide tea, coffee and biscuits. My friend then messaged me saying they'd want to help and asking why I didn't come to them for help. I replied saying ""Thank you (name) . That's really kind of you but I don't want to ask you to come to (my town). I just don't want to put that expectation on you."" . They responded saying ""oh okay.. just needed a friend but I guess we arent anymore"". They hadn't mentioned at all that the reason they wanted to help was because they where lonely and I feel so bad that yet again I've managed to hurt them and make them feel bad.

# 1.



Like most men, I sometimes turn to pornography and masturbation to rid myself of the build up of semen. I wasn‚Äôt proud of it. It was just a biological necessity. Normally I like straight stuff but today I decided to spice it up with some gay content. So I got out my phone and typed the P for Pornhub.

I found a scene that looked promising. Two black gentlemen, running roughshod on each other. It came to a scene where analingus was occurring. One man had the other's ass before him. He gazed somewhat uncertainly at it, perhaps questioning the choices that had led him to this point, then he spat twice to lubricate the coming banquet and buried his face between his partner‚Äôs cheeks.

The spitting dismayed me but alas I was at that point of no retreat and sent forth gooey ropes into a waiting handkerchief. I felt the familiar comedown along with a modicum of shame that I had watched something gay. The homophobia which had been instilled in me in the schoolyard I had never been able to fully dislodge. I remember the time at school, one day we had all been holding hands but now we couldn‚Äôt because it was ‚Äúbent‚Äù. We then chased each other around, transferring ‚Äúbender germs‚Äù to each other.

I did the usual post-release activities. Scrolling social media with my pants around my ankles. Going to the bathroom and disposing of the evidence, washing my hands in almost scalding water. Catching sight of myself in the mirror and promising myself I would improve my habits, maybe exercise instead. It took me a while to see the image, or rather to *notice* I was seeing it. I had put my phone away, but the image, the clip of the ass eating, it was *still there.* Hanging in the air in the mirror next to my reflection, on a little sideways rectangle. I looked behind me, somehow expecting the phone to be stuck to the wall. And it was but it was also on the ceiling and in any direction I looked, playing on no other medium, as far as I could tell, than my brain.

I tried googling it. It was hard to find the exact words. I tried ‚Äúimage stays even after phone is gone‚Äù and ‚Äúimage from phone stays in eyes‚Äù. I got a bunch of answers about pictures being burnt into phone screens. I tried closing my eyes for a while, hoping they were malfunctioning and needed to be reset, that it was just some fleeting aberration, that I wouldn‚Äôt even have to tell people about it. This didn‚Äôt work and I could still see the image in the blackness. I felt my breath getting shallow, the beginnings of a panic attack, and forced myself to breathe deeply.

There must be something wrong with my optic nerve, I thought. I tried shaking my head to shake it loose, like when you try to get a machine to work by banging it with your fist. I shook so hard I felt little blood vessels go in my head as they had when I was a headbanging teenager, but the image held fast. A video playing on a 30 second loop. Considering the ass, spitting twice, gorging. I sighed. It was like I always thought, I could deal with life as long as no unexpected problems came along.

What was it anyway? A psychotic break? A brain tumour? A lot of Americans didn‚Äôt have health insurance so they would post pictures of the unexpected things happening to their body to r/weird/. One woman showed a picture of herself with one pupil dilated. ‚ÄúAm I cooked?‚Äù She asked. ‚ÄúYes! get yourself to the ER right away‚Äù said the top answer. So that was her, brain fried and soon to be bankrupt.

I entered my problem into reddit, hoping for an answer. Maybe something like: ‚Äúyeah, all you need to is look up, down, left, right, and that resets it‚Äù. I had just finished typing when Martyna came home.

My girlfriend. We had been together 3 years. She was Italian. She was renaissance painting beautiful. She even had the extra rolls of fat (Rubenesque they called it) She didn‚Äôt put much effort into her appearance, usually wearing baggy clothes and no makeup but to me that was like putting a tracksuit on the Mona Lisa.

Intellectually she was a knock out as well. She was a Dante scholar, was researching a book about him(I wasn‚Äôt sure why we needed another book on him, but I guess it was like the Beatles, they would always keep coming) , and was always flying off to conferences to talk about the Italian poet. She wasn‚Äôt suited to the Irish climate and always had a cold. My sniffly angel I called her. She was coming back from college where she was doing a Masters in Art History.

She was a staunch Catholic and would sometimes weep when she came across a depiction of the Madonna and child. This was one reason she loved Ireland and she would make us stop if we passed by a Virgin Mary in her grotto on our travels across this green land.

Above all she was kind, would kiss my emotional boo boos like a good Mamma, and was a great cook. Average by Italian standards, and superlative by Irish. Why she was with me was a continuing mystery. Probably a defect in her self-esteem caused by an emotionally distant Father, for which I was eternally grateful.

She collapsed onto the couch and kicked off her shoes like a little girl. Without having to be asked I rubbed her feet. I debated whether to tell her about my situation. I usually believed in keeping my problems to myself, because I felt mine were no worse than anyone else‚Äôs. This time felt different however.

Martyna had a lot on her plate. One of her lecturers, an Italian sculpture expert who resembled none other than Wario, with the same wicked inclination, had made a clumsy pass at her during a visit to Florence, despite being 30 years her senior. He was a smooth talker, who could bowl over some of his more impressionable students with his breadth of knowledge, although if Martyna were to be believed, most of what he said was wildly inaccurate.

She had decided not to make an issue of the incident, as she was close to getting her Masters and didn‚Äôt want to put it in jeopardy, but attending his lectures now carried an extra layer of anxiety. It was sad how common this kind of abuse of power was and every woman I knew had confided in me some similar incident. I had fantasized about confronting the old fool but I convinced myself it would do more harm than good.

Rubbing Martyna‚Äôs shapely feet usually calmed me just as much as it did her. But not this time, I could feel her foot but I couldn‚Äôt see it, it was completely blocked by the hideous rectangle, showing one man anally probling another with his tongue. It seemed to have deliberately positioned itself over my beloved‚Äôs foot, to thwart me from taking refuge in the act.

Martina had a hot Italian temper and an emotional storm could descend out of a clear blue sky. She was prone to jealousy and I knew the mention of porn would not sit well, in her mind there was little difference between actors on a screen and real-life adultery. They were all damned to the second circle as far as she was concerned.

Some of my friends would see her yelling at me and think she was abusive. But they just didn‚Äôt get it. She only got mad about stuff she cared about. I had seen her act the same way when debating a point about Dante with another scholar. Her voice raised, gesticulating wildly. If the other scholar was also Italian it would go to 11 and you felt like a duel was about to break out. Later they‚Äôd have a coffee together in perfect calm. Most of the time she was as gentle as a lamb. It was passion, that‚Äôs all.

Bracing myself for her reaction, still holding her foot, I explained what was happening to me as best as I could. She took it all in, not saying much, and from that I should have known the storm clouds were gathering on the horizon. That night for dinner she made one of my favourites, ravioli in bolognese sauce. (or as Martyna explained, just meat sauce, she was from Bologna and there was no such thing as Bolognese there)

I didn‚Äôt appreciate how much the appearance of a meal factors into the enjoyment of it, until it was replaced by the sight of one man treating another‚Äôs ass like a hungry Japanese person finishing a bowl of noodles.

I heard the dishes clatter as she set them down roughly by the sink and I knew the explosion was coming.

‚ÄúSo you look at porn, huh? Why, AM I NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU?‚Äù

She kept on doing the dishes while shouting at a volume that threatened to smash the glasses she was cleaning.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that‚Ä¶‚Äù I replied feebly.

‚ÄúAND WHY YOU LOOK AT THE GAY STUFF? You say: ‚Äúoh, Martyna, I‚Äôm bisexual, I like the men and the women‚Äù, WAS THIS JUST A LIE? YOU DON‚ÄôT LIKE ME? YOU GONNA BE GAY?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like that‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúVAFFANCULO!(fuck off)‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand. This image, It‚Äôs a real problem, I can‚Äôt stop seeing it‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYOU CAN‚ÄôT STOP THINKING ABOUT IT? ARE YOU GONNA SAY: I DON‚ÄôT WANT YOU NO MORE, I WANT A MAN‚ÄôS ASS?‚Äù

‚ÄúHoney...‚Äù, I said.

I went to the sink and gently held her elbow. Her anger frightened me, but I was also getting angry myself that I wasn‚Äôt being understood.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not thinking,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs *seeing*, I can‚Äôt stop seeing the thing, I think something‚Äôs wrong with me.‚Äù

That seemed to penetrate her red haze.

‚ÄúOh, well...if you‚Äôre like that, you better see a doctor.‚Äù

I lay on the couch, my hand over my eyes.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said sadly, ‚ÄúI will probably have to.‚Äù

She continued to rail at me. Focusing on why porn was a sin and why men who looked at it were the same ones that went out and raped. I mostly agreed and kept my tone calm, hoping to defuse her anger.

‚ÄúIf you want to be gay be gay!‚Äù she declared.

I came and hugged her from behind. ‚ÄúNo, I just want you,‚Äù I said. She snorted derisively but I could tell the storm was over.

She was her most beautiful when she was angry. Kali the destroyer. Worthy of worship. Later we watched a movie together in bed. A slice of life drama about a man who moves back in with his ex-wife after leaving the porn industry. A bit of an unfortunate subject but we left it on because the story was engaging. It was full of pathos as this guy tries to have a normal life, but his ego and desire to be back on top undermines him at every turn. I found it hard to enjoy as 10% of the screen was filled with the phantom phone screen.

I was getting very familiar with it and I started to notice things in the background. The wallpaper was yellow with spots of discolouration. Just above the bed was the bottom part of a picture frame that might have shown a vase. For a second when the eater‚Äôs shoulder moved I could see one of the men‚Äôs watches had been placed on the nightstand.

Martyna, in her The Sims pjs, fell asleep before the movie was over, as was her custom. I tucked her in without waking her. I stripped to my boxers and climbed in beside her. It was one of my little joys to watch her sleep but the hideous rectangle had blocked her face.

I lay awake, unable to sleep as when I closed my eyes I could see the image. So I lay there, waiting for the dawn, dreading what it would bring.

# 2.



The image greeted me in the morning. The sun's rays creating a halo around the hated scene, burning away my hope that sleep could banish it. However I refused to languish in hopelessness and I felt a deepening resolve. Every problem had a solution and I would find mine. Like Martyna I was a student, I was ahead on my studies so I could skip a few classes without affecting things too much, as I searched for a cure.

I was a student of literature.I was a disciple of H. P. Lovecraft and the Weird writers that followed in his wake. Overall I had found the course a pleasing diversion. The emphasis was on producing work and not just intellectual posturing as I had found in other artistic climes. I was frequently told my prose was too flowery, that I was too fond of the thesaurus. I ignored the criticism, approaching 40 it would have been teaching an old scribbler new tricks.

My first step in dealing with my affliction was at a private clinic, where I met with a consultant neurologist, paying a substantial chunk of my savings for the privilege. He was relatively young, about 35, he had thinning hair which made an odd juxtaposition with his young-looking face. If not concern he at least demonstrated professional curiosity upon hearing of my predicament.

I allowed myself to hope that medical science would save me. That I would be the happy recipient of the fruits of centuries of medical research and discovery. After all, I had paid. The hideous rectangle, with its obscene scene, bothered me less, as I figured soon I would be rid of it. It would be a story to tell, to delight and horrify dinner party guests.

‚ÄúCould be a growth on the optic nerve,‚Äù the doctor, whose name was Lynch, said.

‚ÄúMm-hmm,‚Äù I responded knowingly.

A growth on the optic nerve. Of course, what else could it be?

He referred me for an MRI. In the early days of X-Rays doctors would x-ray their own hand every morning to test it. Until their hands started to blacken and rot. I thanked them for their sacrifice. As I lay in the tube like a torpedo I imagined the next step. They would put me to sleep, gently remove my eye and put it to one side on its red string, maybe gently placing it in a little dish, like a ramekin for organs. They would find the offending growth, no bigger than a pea, and it would be cremated in the hospital incinerator.

I allowed myself a smile.

The doctor took me into his office to explain the results.

‚ÄúWell Mr. Renn, I‚Äôve had a look at your scan. Good news, we didn‚Äôt find anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood news? Weren‚Äôt able to find anything?‚Äù I repeated like a stupid parrot.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. So whatever is happening is most likely psychological.‚Äù

I was at a loss for words.

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù I finally managed.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He said condescendingly.

He looked at me like I no longer interested him. He referred me to a psychotherapist, and I had to wait several weeks for an appointment.

It was a shocking blow but after a few hours I was able to regroup. My mistake had been allowing myself to hope. It was disappointing but there were other avenues to explore, other branches of medicine.

To make matters worse Martyna and I got into an argument when I got home. She was wearing her gold, diamond studded cross. I brought up a scene in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade where he must choose the Holy Grail from many possible grails. The Nazi chooses one made of gold and encrusted with jewels (like Martyna‚Äôs cross). Drinking this grail causes him to instantly age and die. Indy, being a student of history, remembers that Jesus was a poor carpenter and chooses a simple wooden cup. Therefore I argued, a modest wooden cross would be more appropriate.

The storm descended and she chewed me out mercilessly, telling me that Indiana Jones was a juvenile American fantasy, and had no place in a discussion of religion. Still the meal that night was perfect. Spaghetti with ragu sauce.

On a positive note I got an answer to my Reddit post. A user called LakersFan33 sent me a private message.

‚ÄúHey man, my name is Nate, I saw you‚Äôre(sic) post. I‚Äôve been where you are now, I just want you to know it gets better.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou found a cure?‚Äù I said hopefully.

‚ÄúIf there is, I haven't found it. But you can learn to live with it.‚Äù

Not what I wanted to hear.

‚ÄúWhat do you see,‚Äù I asked?

‚ÄúA basketball game. The 2020 NBA final, Lakers versus Miami Heat. The Lakers get a rebound, then there‚Äôs a coach huddle. ‚ÄúKeep pushing that rock, keep pushing that rock.‚Äù That‚Äôs what the coach says.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was watching it in a bar, on a big screen.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow big?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe screen was about 50 inches but I wasn‚Äôt sitting right next to it, so it takes up about 40% of my vision.‚Äù

I felt lucky for the first time since this had all started.

‚ÄúHow do you manage?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like being partially sighted. I work in computer programming and use assistive tools.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long has it been?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was the 2020 finals, so yeah, gosh, 5 years already.‚Äù

The very real possibility that I would be stuck with the rectangle for the rest of my life was knocking at the doors of my mind, demanding to be let in.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt watch basketball anymore,‚Äù he continued. ‚Äúcan‚Äôt even be around a basketball. But apart from that life is pretty good. I even got married last year, in Japan.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes your spouse know?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah she knows everything about me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to tell me but what do you see?‚Äù He asked.

‚ÄúPorn. A guy eating another guy‚Äôs ass.‚Äù

It took him a minute to respond.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs tough. I‚Äôm sorry, man. But give it time, you‚Äôd be surprised what you can get used to.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping to find a cure‚Äù I said, feeling lame.

‚ÄúOkay. I gave up on that a long time ago but don‚Äôt let me stop you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think causes it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have no idea. Just one of those things.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay thanks for reaching out,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúNo problem, I‚Äôm always here if you need to talk.‚Äù

I closed reddit. I resented this man who had the same condition as me and seemed to have cheerfully accepted it. Well, I reasoned, the content of his screen wasn‚Äôt as bad as mine, just a basketball game. I could probably live with that. Not the disgusting thing I was forced to watch, which was slowly killing my ability to appreciate life.

He had given up on finding a cure. Unbelievable! He probably just didn‚Äôt have the strength to find it. I would do whatever it took, hiking the Himalayas in search of strange gurus if necessary. Still the quest would have to wait, that evening was my biweekly RPG session. The sessions never failed to cheer me up no matter what was happening in my life, I suppose this would be the ultimate test of that.

Me and the guys had been meeting for four years.I was lucky enough to find a bunch of guys around the same age with similar taste. It was a rare thing to find a good RPG group, especially far into adulthood, so we knew how lucky we were. I called them my beautiful boys.

At the games we would always have a blast, having a few drinks and using the tabletop format as an outlet for our creativity. Right now we were working through a campaign called Masks of Nyarlathotep, in the Call of Cthulhu system, which was based on Lovecraft‚Äôs work.

The fun and engagement of the game was almost enough to shift my focus from the image. But after a while I could feel it increasing in intensity, sucking me in as if the asshole was a black hole. I became withdrawn from the game. Markus, who hosted our games, was a gentle soul. A gay man with ruddy cheeks and bear physique. After the session we stayed on for beer and chat. He asked me if something was wrong.

I was afraid to tell him. We had a good thing going and I didn‚Äôt want to be the one to ruin it. But after braving so many dungeons together I trusted him. I confided in him. He was understanding. He had his own struggles with mental illness. He suffered from OCD of the contamination type. He was afraid that he would give his boyfriend a disease, and so would wash his hands after touching anything that might be dirty.

He was glad to hear I had an appointment with a therapist.

‚ÄúI found therapy really helpful‚Äù, he said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid this might be beyond therapy,‚Äù I said sadly.

‚ÄúTry it,‚Äù he said.

I wasn‚Äôt a big believer in therapy. To me they were like meaning merchants. They gave you a meaning for your life and because it came from an authority you bought it and it made you feel better. The psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Victor Frankl said ‚Äúif one has a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù one can survive any ‚Äúhow‚Äù. Still, if nothing physical was the cause, the mind was the next logical place to look.

The day came to see the therapist. Dr. Hunter. She was in her late twenties, with long straight black hair and black square glasses framing a handsome face. She addressed me with practiced concern. I dutifully explained my situation.

‚ÄúHow long have you had gay thoughts?‚Äù was her response.

‚ÄúUm, since puberty I guess.‚Äù

It was true. When I was about 11 there was a supplement in the newspaper about old Greek statues. They were naked and I found the male and female bodies equally interesting. Still I was concerned she had missed the part where I was being perpetually haunted by an image that grew in strength every day, threatening to engulf my perceptions.

‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù she said. ‚Äúwhen we repress parts of ourselves they come out in other unhealthy ways. The goal is to discover our true self.‚Äù

I thought her theory was bullshit, but desperate as I was I played along.

She set out a program for expunging gay shame. It began with simple steps like repeating affirmations in the mirror. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gay and I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù Martyna overheard me one night.

‚ÄúAre you being gay in there?‚Äù she yelled angrily.

She burst into the bathroom and emptied an entire shampoo bottle onto my head.

The next step was going to a gay men‚Äôs healing camp in the woods. The goal of the weekend (which cost 750 euro per gay) was to completely eliminate any internalised homophobia. The weekend consisted of a lot of group therapy sessions, where the guys spoke about their difficulty in accepting themselves. I could kind of relate but it hadn‚Äôt been a big deal in my life so there I felt like a fraud. They also had drum circles which I really enjoyed. I got these little wooden bongos and I wailed on them. Wailing on those bongos gave me hope.

The final night was the crowning exercise, staring down shame. We stood before each other, naked as the day we were born. I couldn‚Äôt help but look at the dicks and compare them to my own. I liked that mine was straight and not curved. There were a lot of tears and we all went around making closing statements.

That night I convinced another camper to come back to my room with me. A short hirsuite man with a streak of white in his hair, who reminded me of a badger. We had sex and I ate his ass, hoping through sympathetic magic it would cure me. It didn‚Äôt, but it wasn‚Äôt a bad experience and his ass was very clean.

I reported back to the shrink.

‚ÄúWell the shame is gone,‚Äù I told her, ‚Äúbut the image is still there.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúif the image is still there you must still be carrying some shame. Have you been doing the exercises?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, I really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs it.‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Renn, this process only works if you do the work.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook lady, I‚Äôd suck a hundred cocks to get rid of this image. I really don‚Äôt give a damn.‚Äù

She sighed. I could see her losing interest. It seemed by not believing her theory, I wasn‚Äôt playing the game right. I quit therapy in disgust. Another dead end.

With medical science proving no help I decided to seek spiritual help. I sought out a Roman Catholic priest, Father James Cheasty, who I knew from my childhood in Mallow where he oversaw those life events; baptisms, communion, marriages, which the nominally Catholic locals still observed. He was middle-aged, with a bomb blast of white hair and red, inflamed cheeks. He gave the impression of an amateur actor playing a priest in a town hall production.He was fond of drink and cake, but above all he lived for gossip. Being he was town confessor, that was rather like being an alcoholic behind the bar, with scandal on tap.

I explained my plight.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the Devil talking to you,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúhe put that image in your head.‚Äù

Like my therapist he got hung up on the gay angle.

‚ÄúThe gays are one head of the beast spoken of in Revelation.‚Äù he told me.

This was so alien to my own beliefs that I froze, unable to muster a response.

‚ÄúGo to Croagh Patrick, and take this with you,‚Äù he said, handing me a rosary. Croagh Patrick is a mountain in Mayo that has been a site of pilgrimage for centuries. Pilgrims climb it in their bare feet.

So I did it. I went up the mountain with no shoes. Before long my feet were bleeding and my soles peppered with tiny stones. Suffering was a big part of Irish Catholicism. ‚ÄúOffer it up‚Äù people would say when you were in pain. As in offer it up to Jesus on the cross. They didn‚Äôt even have cushions for you to kneel on in church.

At the top there was a powerful wind whipping me. It wasn‚Äôt unpleasant, but actually refreshing. All around was a heavy mist so I couldn't see anything, but that was nice too, like I was in limbo. This felt like something close to divine, a sense of awe in the face of something greater. Still, the hideous rectangle topped it all.

The moment of elation at the top of the mountain passed and I was getting cold so I made my way back down. At the bottom I met two nice old ladies who had set up a stall with tea and scones.

‚ÄúWell done, well done.‚Äù they said.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill you have a scone? You will. There‚Äôs plenty of jam there, help yourself.‚Äù

They made me feel great.

‚ÄúHere, have some wipes for your feet,‚Äù they said, handing me a packet of baby wipes.

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like Jesus, when he washed the feet of his disciples,‚Äù they said.

So this was their purpose, to wait here and wash the pilgrim‚Äôs feet. They seemed content. You just needed a purpose in life. There was plenty of jam and cream for the scones, which were fresh and delicious.

It occurred to me that the most meaningful pilgrimage for me would be to go to Lovecraft‚Äôs grave in Providence. ‚ÄúI am Providence‚Äù read his epitaph and people left pens there. I began to weep.

‚ÄúAh look at him, he‚Äôs overcome with the Lord.‚Äù said one of the ladies.

It wasn‚Äôt that. It was a feeling of total defeat that was taking me over. I felt sure I would never be rid of the image.

Martyna picked me up in her car. She gave me a hug.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud of you Patatino(little Potato)‚Äù

I knew she was hoping that the image was gone but I couldn‚Äôt lie.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still there,‚Äù I said.

She looked distraught and we passed most of the trip in silence. I felt like Dr. Jekyl, Hyde grew in stature and power, while Jekyl shrank and shrank until he vanished. Martyna put on a podcast about the Boer War and I did my best to listen, staring out the window at the green and lush Irish countryside.

Back at home I spoke to Father Cheasty on the phone.

‚ÄúSo, how did you get on?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt work,‚Äù I said flatly.

‚ÄúYou have to have faith, my son. God only asks us to believe.‚Äù

I guess this was the Catholic version of ‚Äúnot doing the work.‚Äù

A few days later I was at home, wrestling with despair. I decided to go for a walk to clear my head (as if that was possible) and in my jacket pocket I found a piece of rose quartz. It had been given to me by Allie, a woman in my class who was into spiritual healing. I had partly confided in her, telling her I had ‚Äúintrusive thoughts‚Äù. She advised me to attend a workshop she was giving. It was in a few nights time, what the heck? I thought. It would be a distraction if nothing else.

The workshop took place in a room above a shop that sold crystals, angel tarot cards and things such as. The attendees were mostly women, some with matted dreadlocks and dressed like they had just got back from backpacking in India. They looked healthy and outwardly serene at least.

Before the workshop started they discussed their respective healing journeys.

‚ÄúI did the rebirthing ritual,‚Äù one woman said. ‚ÄúThe shaman puts you in a bathtub and holds you under. You relive your birth. It‚Äôs a bit pricey though, 300 euro.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing fire breath,‚Äù said another woman, ‚ÄúYou breathe like this,‚Äù she performed a series of short sharp breaths, ‚Äúand it lets you access your repressed trauma.‚Äù

They both sounded like methods to starve the brain of oxygen to induce hallucinations but I kept this observation to myself.

Allie started talking and everyone paid attention.

‚ÄúI was in Connemara at the life festival and I felt called to go into the woods, and there I found a spring. I saw a little figure dancing on the water and realised it was a water spirit. I emanated energy to her that I was friendly and coaxed her into my handbag. My handbag is lined with hemp so it was able to contain her. As you know I was travelling to Zimbabwe for the energy camp. At the airport none of the scanners were able to pick up the water spirit because she wasn‚Äôt on their frequency. When I got there the women of the village told me the camp was cancelled because they were suffering from a drought. The universe had really aligned! They took me to the well that had dried up. I talked to the water sprite, whose name was Nuala, I asked her kindly if she would help these people and she agreed. They were shocked when the well filled up with water and needless to say the camp went ahead as scheduled!‚Äù

This was met with murmured approval although I thought she sounded completely insane. I was conjuring excuses to leave, until Allie pointed right at me.

‚ÄúYou have a dark spot on your aura, about this big‚Äù she said, and made the shape of something the size of a phone. I stayed.

We began the exercise to cleanse our aura. We were told to imagine a ball of bright white energy inside ourselves, spreading outward and pushing out the darkness. I tried but it was hopeless. When I tried my mind was wrenched back to the image, the screen.

At the end of the class we each got a one to one with Allie.

‚ÄúWhat did you see in my Aura?‚Äù I asked her.

‚ÄúWell, Mr. Renn, an entity has attached itself to you. One that means you harm. One that feeds on pain. ‚Äú

‚ÄúWell, okay, how do I get rid of it?‚Äù

She put her hand on my shoulder, a pitying look on her face.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt. Once these things grab on they don‚Äôt let go. It will be with you until your next incarnation.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt means until the end of your natural life.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow would you like to pay for the workshop? I can do cash or card.‚Äù

I lay in bed that night, Martyna next to me. She had been more supportive of late but I saw something else too, her looking away when I spoke to her. Like she was looking for a way out. All the while the image became more clear, more insistent. It reminded me of the line from the Outer Limits. ‚ÄúWe can deluge you with a thousand channels, or expand one single image to crystal clarity and beyond.‚Äù

There had to be an answer. A solution.

I had tried God, I had tried medicine. What was left? I took Martyna‚Äôs crucifix from the wall and held it tightly. I apologised sincerely to God for watching porn, for debasing the sacred act of love. I apologised for all the times I had mocked him. Then for good measure I picked up the rose quartz in my other hand.

I got a picture of myself, clinging to these baubles of faith and I laughed. I realised I didn‚Äôt have any faith to draw on. I put the crystal and cross back and held myself.

Maybe it was like a glitch in the matrix. There were theories that we lived in a holographic universe, created by our own perceptions. Somehow for me, where perception met reality had gotten screwed up. It probably only happened to 1 in a billion people. Lucky me.

Reality was becoming like the area around a cinema screen. Slowly fading from perception. There was only the image. Face and ass. The grim feast.

Nate the basketball guy sent me a message.

‚ÄúHey, buddy, just wanted to check in, see how you were doing.‚Äù

I was too depressed and ignored it. Life was torture. I could only sleep when I was totally exhausted and then only for an hour or two. I couldn‚Äôt make love to Martyna. She had stopped even appearing undressed in my presence. She knew exactly what I was seeing and it disgusted her in turn.

My thoughts turned naturally to the final solution. Ending my life. I would obliterate myself and the image with it. Would that be losing? I was reminded of a comedian‚Äôs joke about losing the fight to cancer. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs kind of a draw, it‚Äôs not like the cancer gets to take over your job and bang your wife after you‚Äôre dead.‚Äù

I thought about how I would do it. There was a train that ran behind my house. It was big and powerful enough to get the job done. All I would have to do is lie down and fight the urge to live.

No, I couldn‚Äôt think like that. Things would right themselves. They had to. Besides, Martyna and my friends would be sad if I killed myself. I clung to that thought and was able to escape into two hours of semi-consciousness.

I would hold on for another 7 years.

Martyna was pregnant, from one of the last times we made love before the image. I knew she wanted to leave me. However she thought of herself as a good person, and a good person wouldn‚Äôt leave someone because of an ailment that was outside their control. So carried a healthy resentment for me as she carried my child. On the day she gave birth I was with her in the delivery room. She crushed the bones in my hand and swore in Italian. It was a boy, a screaming gore-covered baby boy.

As I held little Dante in my arms I felt none of the emotions a new Father should feel. That transcendent feeling of being a link in a chain going all the way back to Adam, all was void. At the centre of my vision was a meal as important for me as the Last Supper was to those of the Christian faith. But it wasn‚Äôt a symbolic body being eaten, but the ass of a man in a brightly lit room for an audience of devoted perverts.

# 3.



My life fell away piece by piece. I dropped out of my studies. When I wrote something, when I checked back afterwards it was just a description of that horrible image. I was hoping my professor would find it experimental but instead he just said ‚Äúthe first time was funny but you really can‚Äôt keep doing it.‚Äù

As my drinking got worse I started to spoil the atmosphere at the RPG sessions. While the others were nicely tipsy I was messy drunk and would interrupt the game to make jokes that crossed the line from uncomfortable to simply wrong. Finally the day came when Markus took me aside and told me with great tact that I was no longer welcome. In a way I was grateful. I didn‚Äôt want to be the one who ruined things for everyone else. I knew they would be happier without me.

Martyna was desperately unhappy. I would overhear her on video calls with her Mother who begged her to leave me. I didn‚Äôt have to speak Italian to understand the word ‚ÄúZombi‚Äù. To the outside world I appeared checked out and distant. They didn‚Äôt know the private battle that was going on, a battle I was losing.

I was a terrible Father to Dante. I seemed to have a knack of missing all the major milestones of his life, his first word(‚Äúghetti‚Äù, short for spaghetti‚Äù), his first steps. Martyna would yell at me, saying it was because I was ‚Äúin your own world, dreaming of gay bullshit‚Äù.

Things finally came to a head when Dante was having his first soccer game. He was 7. I was watching from the sidelines, drunk at 12 in the afternoon and trying to hide it. The little guy was moving so fast with the ball that the image was having a hard time covering him up and my eyes were stinging with pride. Without warning he was viciously tackled by another boy, one who looked far too big for 7. The ref didn‚Äôt call a foul and I lost it.

This was the first shred of Fatherly joy I had felt in years and I wasn‚Äôt going to let this mutant kid ruin it.

‚ÄúHey, Ref!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you blind. That kid massacred my boy!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook how big he is, is he on steroids?‚Äù

The ref sounded confused, even scared.

‚ÄúEh, sir, I think you should sit back down.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell are you gonna do something about that giant?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, you can‚Äôt be on the pitch.‚Äù

Something about the way he looked at me defused my anger and I sat back down. The other spectators were giving me strange looks. I found out later that what I thought I said was not what I said. It had actually gone like this:

‚ÄúHey, Ref!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat kid was in my son‚Äôs ass.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you blind he was right up in his ass!‚Äù

‚ÄúEh, sir, I think you should sit back down.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you gonna do something about the fact that kid was eating my son‚Äôs ass?‚Äù

‚Äú....Please, you can‚Äôt be on the pitch.‚Äù

I could feel my mind giving way. Like someone who has abused drugs for years it just wasn‚Äôt firing right anymore.

Martyna‚Äôs famous ravioli was water-logged that night as she told she had been humiliated by the neighbourhood parents. They were making jokes in the group chat about her ass eating obsessed partner. It was that night she told me she would be leaving me.

I thought more and more about suicide and the relief it would bring. The remains of the day. When there would be no more work to do.

I found a bag of marbles I had had as a child. Some black and opaque, others clear with a little wisp of colour going through them. There was one I had almost choked on when I was 5, my Mother had heard me making a racket, banging against the walls and ran in from the kitchen. When she saw I was choking she lifted me up by the legs and smacked me until it fell out. It still had marks where I had bit it coming out.

There was a bigger one in the bag, perfect for my adult throat. There was a joke there about losing my marbles.

The rectangle had taken everything from me. Everyone had abandoned me or I had driven them away, I wasn‚Äôt sure which. My money wasted on quack therapies. I was in a motel and couldn‚Äôt afford another night. Tomorrow I would be on the streets. I had always had a profound fear of homelessness. I knew I didn‚Äôt have the strength to face that, so I resolved to go while I still had the comfort of 4 walls around me.I supped on a bottle of Jameson and winced as it burned my throat.

Before I had held onto the idea that killing myself would make my friends sad. Now I knew it made them sadder to see what I had become.

The basketball guy, Nate, had thrown in the towel too. I got an update about him on Reddit. He had gone to the home of the former coach of the Lakers, Frank Vogel. His broken mind somehow holding him responsible. He was smashing windows by throwing rocks when the cops showed up and blew him away. I felt bad for ignoring his message. I checked and he had left me one last message the day of his date. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll push that rock right through his face‚Äù it read.

There was not much of a view from the motel room window. Just the tiny carpark, and a nearby pizza place. Correction a burger and pizza place that had joined forces. I was a little hungry. I hadn‚Äôt eaten for the last 24 hours as I was embarrassed at the thought of shitting myself when I died.

The blue sky above had only one cloud, the image. I‚Äôll be rid of you soon, I thought with a sense of triumph that was quickly swallowed by despair.

I took out the bag of marbles.I swallowed the glass ball and felt it perfectly plug my throat. Panic set in as I tried to breathe and couldn‚Äôt. I thought about trying to save myself, performing a self-heimlich on the table perhaps. I suppressed these instincts. We are good at that, aren‚Äôt we? Stopping ourselves from talking out of turn, from eating until it was lunchtime. For most of us the body was easy to control. Not so the mind.

I felt the first relief in 7 years as my vision faded, along with the image. It began to dance and move around, I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was panicking as it died, or if it was laughing at me‚Ä¶

FADE TO BLACK.

I came to and saw a bedroom. Bare, with dingy yellow wallpaper. Above the bed the bottom third of a painting was visible, which may have depicted a vase of flowers. I tried to look up to see the rest but I couldn‚Äôt move my neck. The players entered stage right. The two men I knew so well.They were wearing towels which they wasted little time in removing. One man supped from a juice box. I had never seen his face before. He looked ready to get back to work. He took off his watch and placed it on the bedside table.

The men got into position. I tried to shut my eyes but couldn‚Äôt. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to stop seeing, unless the cameraman put a cap on the lens. A voice spoke from outside my vision:

It was great most of the time, but terrible sometimes.Luckily, he doesn't smoke anymore, but I do.

I have no information about tobacco topic. Older seller had up and downs in last years so im not sure to buy from them again to roll dice on my short budget. I bought 500 grams of tobacco that recommended on net (I've run out of the older one) and made a pack, but it tastes like coffee. It's less sharp but has a more stifling feeling, like it's suffocating, not worth smoking. It's legal and branded in my country, but I didn't like the feel at all.

I asked father today, and he said, ""We always bought the same light tobacco from the same merchant. You sometimes complained, but it's all about how they preserved it until selling.""

I don't know how to explain the taste of tobacco I liked; ""sharper"" is the only word I can use to describe it. Maybe the ones I used were dry, so I thought and tried to dry some of the current one. It did not give me what I'm looking for.

So, to you experts:

How i can find what im looking for other than buy and try everything on the planet

Does a more suffocating feeling mean stronger tobacco?

Is dryer tobacco really the solution, or am I going the wrong way?

Can i somehow fix current tobacco to my liking ? im bit short on budget so would be nice to ""save"" it

So this ""older"" newbie doesnt know which way he should go.

edit: also i forgot to add, when cigarette stays in colder place sometimes it tastes way better, why is it ?",1,1751835376.0,RYO,0,1.0,False

I was told I needed surgery back then and freaked out but a different doctor said no and I ran with that answer and paused on the topic for a few years.

My latest echo June 2025 shows now unequivocal severe leakage, so the doc said I'll be needing surgery at some point - a great unknown - 1 year? 10? My left atrium is a healthy size. I do now accept I will be needing surgery, and am not spiraling about it, though it feels insanely surreal to imagine someone operating on my heart.

My question comes in here - I claim to be asymptomatic - no ""shortness of breath"" - I can hike at elevation breathing through my nose - but I do have a lot of palpitations, and now I'm wondering if my energy should be... a lot higher. Reading more in here, I see a lot of people referencing energy levels but no doctor ever mentioned this to me.

I used to teach 9 or so aerial silks classes/week. I became exhausted but other teachers who taught 2x as much as me said they felt fine. I was sometimes going back to bed at 11am. I assumed it was from teaching so much.

I stopped teaching cold turkey (a different story) mid 2024 and quit coffee and saw improvements to my energy.

But I'm starting to wonder if what has started to feel like ""normal"" tiredness is not actually normal at all. It's inconsistent and I know fatigue has 190394203894 causes so hard to pin that down.

Since teaching days and still now I feel like my muscle recovery is abysmal - like I got hit by a truck or sore - not in the right way - the day after any muscular exertion, even just lifting one heavy thing.

And if I go from resting to movement quickly, my heart definitely feels chaotic.

Any thoughts on whether this is all related to MVP and considered symptoms?

I'm healthy, zero drinking or substances, active, eat normally. I am a singer and have really strong lungs - I had to do a breath test at my allergy clinic when I started having anaphylaxis once and even with wheezing I blew way above average.

(some sentences may sound weird cuz i don't speak english fluently) 

To put this in context, i entered university in march 2025, in the first day i meet this group of girls, one of them (the one who talked to me in the first place) was the funniest one, we have a lot in common and pursue the same goals on our career and have the same beliefs and ethics (we study social work, and it's not that common to find someone like that), the first week i thought she was so funny and pretty attractive, but then she told me she was in a long distance relationship with another girl, everyday i have to hear about how cool her girlfriend is, she is really in love with her, and i can't blame her. Our friends were kinda invalidating her relationship, one of our friends kept flirting with her ""as a joke"" and she started to feel bad about it, so i had to cheer her up, even if it kinda hurted me. I started seeing other people, even fucked with a random guy i meet, but the feeling never disappeared. We kept getting closer, i would buy her food and she would buy me coffee after our long study sessions, we didn't even think about calling our group to study, we worked well together. This week our uni was closed and we didn't have any place to study so she suggested her house, i went yesterday for what i expected was a couple hours, but i ended sleeping over. Her mom loved me, she kept offering me food, her mom and dad said she talks about me with them, i just laughed and she was kinda nervous, she is pretty relaxed and talkative in uni but now she seemed shy. Her parents are religious, so i suspect that seeing her bisexual daughter with a boy was hopeful for them, idk. She shares a room with her sister, and everytime she wanted to go in, she knocked the door, it was kinda funny but akward since we both knew what they were thinking. 
I know is weird, but i really wanted to sleep in the same bed with her, but obviously she slept in the same bed with her sister (we are both 18 and she is 16), we still kept talking and joking, then in a moment when we were joking about the music, she went and got on top of me, i froze in place and said ""get tf off"" laughing, her sister, half asleep, asked her ""what the f are you doing?"" we both laughed and she went back to bed. I couldn't sleep well, today morning she took me to the bus stop in a awkward silence and then i went home. I can't stop thinking about it, and now i really feel bad because she is in love with someone else, and im absolutely not her type or anything, it's absolutely impossible to have something, i just want the feelings to go, and i don't want to ruin our friendship.

How can indie/solo devs earn your support and trust?

As you might know, the entire games industry is under extreme pressure right now. I see this as a great opportunity for smaller devs as I predict a lot of players are going to look for these smaller production gems.

We smaller devs have a lot of drive and creativity, but most of us have the same brutal challenge, survive while making the game without proper funding.

I would love to start asking players more about this topic in order to help devs, like myself, figure out creative ways to get some revenue while making the game, thus be able to pay the bill and have total focus on making the best game possible without having to take on client work or a second job (and risk getting burnt out)

There's 2 traditional ways top of mind that involve player support

* Sell merch
* Patrion / BMC donations and subscription memberships.

So my question is, how can a developer earn your support? There's a lot of risk in supporting a developer with an unfinished game. What can a developer do to earn that trust?

I'm currently developing my own game and have a [support page setup (Buy me a coffee)](https://buymeacoffee.com/projectucg) (just to give an example). I plan to self publish the game. My current approach so far is to include enthusiasts in the process through a V.I.P membership which gives them access to the latest build, continuous updates with behind-the-scenes material.

And then periodically have public play sessions to test the game with a broader group of people.",0,1751835010.0,IndieGaming,5,0.25,False

  3. **15 minutes later...** ‚è∞

  4. **Give up or spend 30 more minutes** üò§

  **Result:** 30% abandonment rate on promising tools

  ## The Engineering Challenge

  **How do you maintain full functionality while eliminating setup complexity?**

  This isn't just a UX problem - it's a **technical architecture problem**.

  ---

  ## Our Solution: Progressive Security + Intelligent Configuration

  ### Technical Architecture

  **1. Secure Temporary Key Generation**
  ```typescript
  class SecureConfigGenerator {
    generateDemoKeys(): DemoConfig {
      return {
        jwt: this.createJWT({
          expires: '24h',
          scope: 'demo',
          permissions: ['read', 'generate']
        }),
        session: crypto.randomBytes(64).toString('hex'),
        csrf: crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex'),
        limits: { maxRequests: 100, timeWindow: '1h' }
      };
    }
  }

  2. Runtime Security Validation
  function validateEnvironment() {
    // Prevent demo config in production
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && isDemoConfig()) {
      throw new SecurityError('Demo configuration detected in production!');
    }

    // Auto-expire demo keys
    if (configExpired()) {
      console.warn('Demo expired. Run: npm run secure-setup');
      return false;
    }

    return true;
  }

  3. Progressive Complexity Model
  const securityLevels = {
    demo: {
      setup: 'zero-config',
      security: 'temporary-keys',
      limitations: 'local-only'
    },
    development: {
      setup: 'auto-generated',
      security: 'full-encryption',
      limitations: 'rate-limited'
    },
    production: {
      setup: 'user-provided',
      security: 'enterprise-grade',
      limitations: 'none'
    }
  };

  Technical Results

  | Engineering Metric   | Before (v1.0)    | After (v1.1)    | Impact     |
  |----------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------|
  | Setup time           | 15 minutes       | 30 seconds      | 30x faster |
  | Config errors        | ~30% failure     | 0% failure      | Eliminated |
  | Security score       | Manual (B grade) | Auto (A+ grade) | Upgraded   |
  | Developer onboarding | 70% success      | 100% success    | Perfect    |

  React-Specific Engineering

  Smart Component Generation

  // Automatically detects React patterns:
  const generateReactComponent = (specification) => {
    const needsState = specification.interactions.length > 0;
    const needsClient = needsState || specification.hasEventHandlers;

    return `
  ${needsClient ? ""'use client';"" : ''}

  interface ${specification.name}Props {
    ${generateTypeScriptInterface(specification)}
  }

  export function ${specification.name}(props: ${specification.name}Props) {
    ${needsState ? generateStateLogic(specification) : ''}
    
    return (
      ${generateOptimizedJSX(specification)}
    );
  }
    `;
  };

  Next.js 15 Optimizations

  - Automatic 'use client' directive insertion
  - Server vs Client component detection
  - App Router pattern recognition
  - TypeScript strict mode compliance
  - Performance optimization suggestions

  The Engineering Philosophy

  Core insight: Developer time is the most valuable resource.

  Design principles:
  1. Zero-friction demonstration - Let the tool speak for itself
  2. Progressive complexity - Start simple, scale to enterprise
  3. Security by default - No compromises on security
  4. Fail-fast validation - Catch issues early and clearly

  ---
  Try the Engineering

  Zero-config demo (30 seconds):
  git clone https://github.com/lionel1021/mcp-code-generator.git
  cd mcp-code-generator && npm install && npm run demo

  What you'll see:
  - ‚úÖ Auto-generated secure configuration
  - ‚úÖ React component generation in action
  - ‚úÖ TypeScript + Next.js 15 optimization
  - ‚úÖ Zero manual setup required

  Validate the architecture:
  npm run security-check  # See the security implementation
  npm run dev            # Experience the React generation

  Discussion Questions

  For React developers:
  1. What's your most frustrating tool setup experience?
  2. How do you balance security vs developer experience?
  3. What would convince you to try a new React tool?

  For architects:
  1. How do you solve the ""demo vs security"" tension?
  2. What patterns work best for progressive complexity?
  3. Any thoughts on our technical approach?

  Engineering feedback welcome! This is v1.1.0 - what would you improve?

Especially so publicly, but I could really do with a supportive ear...","I'm going to tag this as possibly being triggering to those with eating disorders because it could be, although I don't have a diagnosis of any eating disorder myself.


Anyway, here goes. 

I've been very severely depressed for the last year or two. More than usual at least. I'm crying constantly, I don't want to wake up in the morning and dread every day. I do see a psychiatrist but it hasn't been helpful so far. 

I joined Slimming World (UK and Ireland based weight loss group) in October and went from being obese at 13 stone 2 pounds to being normal at 9 stone 9 pounds. But I still hate myself. I can't stand to look at myself in a mirror or even when I walk past a shop window or something. I also still see myself as obese.. It's insane. Like I look at my clothes and think they look fairly small and then I put them on and it's like they go from a size 8-10 to a size 18-20 right before my eyes like some fun house mirror trick. 

Yesterday I really wanted a scone. Like just a plain scone with some butter but on Slimming World, you can't have a scone. I broke down in the middle of the grocery aisle, went home and didn't get out of bed til now. 

I'm tired of it. I'm tired of not being able to eat anything at a party. I'm tired of not being able to eat a single thing when I've been out walking around all day. I'm tired of meeting my book club for coffee and sitting there hiding my misery from having to watch everyone else enjoy a couple of cookies or a little slice of cake.

My weight loss goal is 9st 6lbs so I am only 3 pounds off but I have been this weight for about 5 weeks now. I can't lose any more and I can tell you why. 

Last week I had a hospital appointment. It was in another county so I was out for hours. So I ate a small baguette with some plain chicken and the tiniest bit of cheese, but ate healthy the rest of the week. 

The week before that I got stranded in Dublin city for 12 hours so had some ice cream and a prepackaged sandwich. 

I don't know how much more limitation I can take. It's seriously affecting my life but at the same time I am terrified of gaining the weight back and I don't know how to avoid that without this group because it's the only way I've managed to lose weight. 

I'm also very broke. I am claiming disability which is so far below the poverty like it should be criminal. I do my best with it by buying absolutely everything on sale. This Slimming World group charges ‚Ç¨10 per week. Which is half my groceries. However I saw it as worth the benefits. But they also charge for weeks you've missed.. I don't miss many at all but it's a voluntary group and life happens. So when you do show up you are made pay the balance or restart your membership (which erases your progress and costs ‚Ç¨5 extra). This is a struggle for me sometimes. I don't want to sound ungrateful and the lady who runs it is lovely. I brought up my concerns on the Slimming world subreddit and they tore into me like im the problem for not being totally fine with it. 

Sometimes it feels a little like a cult to me. Just sometimes like when you feel like you can't voice any criticism about it. 

Anyway, I know this was long. Thanks for reading if you make it this far, you've no idea how I appreciate it. ",0,1751834772.0,mentalhealth,0,0.5,False

Do you have a boyfriend, to which I said yes (i don't have one), then he said it was such a shame cuz he liked me, my body, my personality then asked me if i was taking hormones and that my tits looked quite provoking and that if i were single he would marry me (i was like bro you're already married), me being a shy person just smiled awkwardly and waited for my brother to arrive there (i felt pretty uncomfortable about the whole interaction), Then I told my brother, he just laughed at me and told me to ask him for money (not the answer I expected since he's very religious), then I told my mom, and she also found the situation kinda funny, and then on a different occasion she jokingly said that I should get a sugar daddy. 

Sometimes I still have to go there, but fortunately everything is normal and as if that never happened, which is very convenient for me, but it just made me feel both grossed out and ewphoric cuz unfortunately those are situations that women have to face on a daily basis and I would love to get more empathy specially from women instead of making it look like a joke.

I'm seeking a partner for a long term relationship that hopefully leads to being a life partner. I am a slight introvert that is trying to go out more (by traveling, studying in coffee shops, etc.) and get better at meeting new people. Usually I'm alone in public and I'd love for someone to be there with me. I love the comfortable silences and just enjoying being in someone's company. Almost like experiencing the world without the overabundance of social interaction. Hopefully that makes sense.

I'm a software engineer and a bit of a geek. I love learning new things and meeting new people. I love road trips, museums, hiking, seeing cool things, and going to beautiful places. I like learning about different cultures and about the people in them. I like trying new foods and listening to music. I want someone I can do weird things with and make her smile and laugh. I want someone to cuddle and hold. I want her to know I'm all hers and she's all mine (Monogamy only). Also, I like horror and sappy movies so hopefully you'll watch those with me :). Physically, I'm white, 5'9"", and fairly average looking, but with blue eyes. I do have a Christian background, but have had my own set of issues. Open to kids with the right partner.

INTP Personality type.

What I'm looking for in a partner

* Naturally kind and loyal.
* Has her own set of clearly defined goals regardless of what they might be.
* Healthy mentally/physically and at a place in their life where they have the time to pursue a relationship with me.
* Wants to go on road trips with me.
* Will travel around the world with me.
* Must be clingy and like to spend time around your partner.

Bonuses:

* You will watch horror films and sappy movies with me.
* You will go to the gym with me.
* If your love languages are quality time and physical touch.
* You like anime, k-dramas, tabletop games, or video games.

My biggest con is that I do move for work on occasion, so I would like someone that would be comfortable moving with me till we find somewhere we'd really like to live. If you are interested, feel free to reach out and tell me a bit about yourself :)",1,1751834653.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1ltbj6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1ltbj6s/thank_you_my_experience_on_the_ring_road/,Thank you! My experience on the Ring Road(:,"Thanks everyone for helping me culminate my itinerary. I‚Äôd like to pay it forward and post my experiences which I hope will be a realistic and helpful resource! This was my first time solo travelling, and van camping and I would be happy to answer any questions(:

8 nights/7 days traveling the Ring Road by 2x2 camper van, solo US female mid twenties, late June/early July. 

I had a ‚Äòloose‚Äô itinerary planned out and probably followed only half of it. Rest assured, as someone who experiences fomo in a new place and gets stressed I‚Äôm not seeing everything/making the most of everything ‚Ä¶ I did not encounter this in Iceland which is lovely because as soon as you leave the city center, you will be blown away. In fact, I didn‚Äôt even see puffins on my trip ! Crazy I‚Äôm sure for many to read but I kinda didn‚Äôt realize they only were easily accessible to spot in the southern east coast and this was majorly overlooked and mistaken on my part... I was debating making the drive back over there as I went counter-clockwise but my last night I was way too tired to drive and ended up just camping close to the airport for my early flight home. 

Since my flight landed late I had to book an airbnb in Keflavik, then Happy Campers picked me up to pick up the van in the morning. 

Day 1: 
- Pick up van from Happy Campers
- Giantess in the Mountain
- Elf School in Reykjavik (only takes place on Fridays). I ended up being the only one to book that week and got to have a one-on-one with Magnus the headmaster for almost 5 hours! A highlight of my trip for sure. If you are interested in folklore, spiritual, and or are religious I would recommend looking into this for something extremely unique and intimate. This most definitely took the place of going to a museum to learn more about Iceland.
- Thingvellir National Park
- Bruarfoss
- Geyser
- Camp at Skjol
Only myself and a few others at Bruarfoss and Geyser as it was 11pm-12am. 

Day 2:
- Gullfoss
- Mr. Iceland Horseback Riding. I have to be honest and say I am not sure I would recommend booking which saddens me to say. But first let me preface I did not receive the full experience I booked as I was the only one to book the Ride + Dinner option. Because of this and me being the only one signed up, dinner was cancelled. I was taken for a solo ride accompanied by 3 other women who work on the ranch and was disappointed with the lack of personability. I was trying to start conversations, and they really amounted to nothing. Paid $275 for a horseback ride which lasted about an hour and a half. I don't know, I can't speak for the dinner portion obviously but if you're just looking to just horseback ride, I would recommend looking at other options which are also cheaper. BUT everything happens for a reason!(: And I think if dinner had happened, I would not have had the energy to make the drive to Thakgil later. 
- Seljavallalaug Swimming Pool
- Camp at Thakgil - Remains the absolute highlight of my trip. Highly, highly recommend. I have no experience of off-roading, and my knuckles often went white on the steering wheel, but my non-4WD camper van and I made it - you can do it! They also offer small cabins to book, and even just worth it for the drive if you do not even camp. 
- This was the day I had noted to go to Dyrh√≥laey to see puffins which I now would have loved to do, but after Thakgil I was totally content with my time in Iceland and it was only day 2!

Day 3:
- Hike at Thakgil
- Drive to Jokusarlon Glacier Lagoon/Diamond Beach
- Stopped along the way through the moss lava fields to look at the Glacier and CRIED! Was extremely moving to see and have never experienced something like that before. A heaviness of beauty and the need to protect nature. The stop had a restaurant and it is where you can take a boat and look at the icebergs... I am unsure of the name of the stop or restaurant but it is hard to miss while driving. 
- Jokusarlon and Diamond Beach
- Drive and camp at Djupivogur
- Along the drive I saw reindeer

Day 4:
- Walk around and enjoy Seydisfjordur
- Sundlaug 
- Ate at Beitarh√∫si√∞. The vegetable soup was superb! First time eating out and was prepared for how expensive but still shocked me a bit in the moment lol.
- Went to Mars! Hverir Geothermal area and hiked
- Gr√≥tagj√° Cave
- Walked around Husavik and camped at Husavik Campsite (there is a special spot secluded and surrounded by a circle of trees!)

Day 5:
- Whale Museum and coffee shop while waiting for whale watching tour with North Sailing. The tour ended up getting cancelled due to rough seas and I had the option to wait a couple more hours in Husavik or go to their other location just outside of Akureyri. 
- Godafoss
- Drove to Akureyri and went to Fairytale Figures which is an incredibly beautiful backyard of a folk artist's and you can walk around and enjoy his beautiful creations. 
- Whale Watching! We saw about 5 Humpback Whales. Would recommend North Sailing. 
- Grafarkirja Church 
- Drove all the way to Saeberg Hostel/Campground and went in the hot tub at 1am
- Saw an Artic Fox on the drive

Day 6:
Walked not even 10 minutes from camp to a natural hot spring called Natturulaugin a Reykjaskola and cold plunged into the sea
- Drove to Snaefellsness Peninsula and ate fish + chips from a food truck in the harbor watching fish getting loaded from boats to trucks
- Drove to Arnastapi and along the way stopped at a canyon for a little hike and waterfall. 
- Hike from Arnastapi to Hellsnar, so beautiful
- Black Church
- Camp at Grundarfjordur with the view of Kirkjufell Mountain and go to the Sundlaug

Day 7:
- Troll Garden
- Bjarteyjarsandur Farm - so beautifully peaceful and welcoming people. Walked to the beach, pet the sheep and dogs, and had a cup of tea
- Hvammsv√≠k Hot Springs
- Drive and camp at Vogar Campsite (close to airport and to reutrn the van in the morning)

Extra tidbits: 
- Recommend the mix of Sundlaugs, Natural Hot Springs/Cold plunges, and Spas. Was really happy with my mix of 2 Sundlaugs, 2 natural springs, and 1 spa. 
- Don't rush the beginning of the trip if driving counter-clockwise. I could have slowed down a bit and saw puffins lol. 
- In the best way, don't expect a lot from the towns. I love how there is truly a handful of shops - if that - and restaurants to pop into, but just know this as likely you will not need much time to spend in them if you are on the move like I was.  
- Search for Galleri's for lopapeysas - the search began to feel like wedding dress as I tried on many when I encountered them along the road lol but I finally felt right with one in Snaefellsness at Galleri Lundi which had in my opinion the most beautiful assortment and quite inexpensive compared to others. 
- As far as crowds go, I really was only bothered once at Godafoss and this is when a tour bus dropped off everyone and I was trying to use the bathroom at the gift shop. OH MY I almost started to panic I could barely get out of there. The sites themselves were not as bothersome as I had been reading and maybe because in the US, tourists spots are always pretty populated? That being said, I did see some spots off hours which was also nice. 
- Toilets. I stay very hydrated and often have to pee. There were at least 3 times where I reallllly had to go and was kinda out of luck so just keep in mind while on the road. 
- I am now obsessed with licorice coated in milk chocolate. Icelandic licorice is different and delicious from someone who cannot stand Swedish licorice! My favorite being Appollo bars - the ones with shredded coconut. 
- Fill up your water bottle with streams (close to source) any time you can. 
- I love not having stop signs and only yield signs, and the yellow light before red light makes a lot of sense. 
- The pull-off areas totally sneak up on you, and there are not many. I continued driving on and often times if I would have known they were there, would have liked to stop so just keep an eye out! In some areas, they have signs about 500km before. Please do not stop after passing it to try to turn around as this is extremely dangerous.

I lost that printout, went on with life, and spent the better part of almost 15 years trying to find it again.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Same-Game Parlay Pick: Chicago Cubs Money Line + Under 7.0 Runs**  
**Bookmaker: BetRivers**  
**Odds: 1.43 (Cubs ML) + 2.0 (Under 7.0) = 2.86 Total Odds**

**Why This Works:**

1. **Chicago Cubs Money Line (1.43):**
   * The model projects a **70% implied probability** for Chicago, making them a strong favorite. With a 1.43 money line, the implied probability is \~70% (1/1.43 ‚âà 70%), aligning perfectly with the model‚Äôs projection.
   * Key context: St. Louis is missing **Willson Contreras** and **Nolan Arenado**, two key offensive threats, and their return isn‚Äôt until Friday. This weakens the Cardinals‚Äô lineup, favoring Chicago‚Äôs balanced offense.
2. **Under 7.0 Runs (2.0):**
   * The model‚Äôs implied probability for the under is **50%** (1/2.0). While the model doesn‚Äôt explicitly project the total, Chicago‚Äôs **Matthew Boyd** (5.5 Ks in a 5-2 win) and St. Louis‚Äô injury-depleted offense suggest a low-scoring game.
   * Historical context: The under is **15-5 in Boyd‚Äôs last 20 starts** when facing teams with subpar lineups (like the injury-hit Cardinals).

**Combined Implied Probability:**

* **35%** (1/2.86 ‚âà 35%) vs. **35% expected value** (70% \* 50%). This is a **zero-edge bet** at best, but the model‚Äôs confidence in Chicago‚Äôs win and the Cardinals‚Äô offensive struggles make this a **safe, low-risk parlay**.

**Why Not Other Combos?**

* **Cubs -1.5 Run Line + Under:** The run line (1.96) has a **51% implied probability**, but the model‚Äôs 70% win probability for Chicago suggests a **26% chance to win by 2+ runs** (70% \* 51% ‚âà 35.7%). This is slightly worse value than the ML + Under combo.
* **Over 7.0 Runs:** The over is **1.81-1.85** at most books, implying a **55% chance**. The model doesn‚Äôt support this, and Boyd‚Äôs dominance makes it a poor pick.

**Final Verdict:**  
This parlay balances Chicago‚Äôs high win probability with the under‚Äôs value against a weakened Cardinals offense. It‚Äôs a **low-risk, high-confidence play** for a 286% return on a $100 bet.

**Bet Size:** $100 (Potential Payout: $286)  
**Bookmaker:** BetRivers (Ensure all legs are from the same bookmaker!)

# My Questions for Locals:

1. **Should i skip the guided tour of the coast and just drive myself? I like the idea of structure and seeing places i wouldve never taken myself, and hate long drives, but would hate to rush back if im vibing at the beach.**
2. **Does anything in this plan seem overly ambitious or unrealistic?**
3. **Any local food stops or hole-in-the-wall places near these areas I can't miss?**
4. **Would you skip any of these plans or suggest an alternative?**
5. **Any suggestions around mount hood for when there is downtime between wedding activities?**¬†

Really appreciate your time and any feedback! I want to make the most of this trip without burning myself out or missing the hidden gems.

Thanks in advance üå≤‚ú®

I‚Äôm a 25-year-old Middle Eastern doctor, currently navigating the beautiful chaos that is life and medicine. I‚Äôm relaxed by nature, grounded in faith, and always trying to balance ambition with peace of mind. I‚Äôm here in the hopes of meeting someone kind, thoughtful, and genuinely interested in building a meaningful connection.

When I‚Äôm not working long shifts or juggling hospital drama (the real kind, not Grey‚Äôs Anatomy), I‚Äôm usually out for walks, swimming, hiking when I can escape the city, or checking out new caf√©s and restaurants. I‚Äôm also a reader at heart; Murakami is my go-to, and if you‚Äôve read Kafka on the Shore, we‚Äôre already off to a great start.

Medicine is something I‚Äôm genuinely passionate about. It‚Äôs not just a career, it‚Äôs a calling, with all the highs and lows that come with it. It‚Äôd be amazing to meet someone who either shares that passion or at least understands what it‚Äôs like being in this field.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù, tan skin, black hair, brown eyes, and a light beard. I speak Arabic fluently, and I‚Äôd love to connect with someone who speaks another language too. I think being bilingual adds a unique layer to how we see the world and relate to others.

I'm looking to meet someone between 21 and 25. Someone who‚Äôs sincere, curious about life, and open to building something real. Bonus points if you‚Äôre kind, a little nerdy, or like long conversations over good coffee (or tea I‚Äôm flexible üòÑ).

If this resonated with you at all, I‚Äôd really appreciate it if you messaged me with a bit about yourself and maybe a photo too. I‚Äôm happy to do the same.

Looking forward to hearing from you ‚ú®

How can indie/solo devs earn your support and trust?

As you might know, the entire games industry is under extreme pressure right now. I see this as a great opportunity for smaller devs as I predict a lot of players are going to look for these smaller production gems. 

We smaller devs have a lot of drive and creativity, but most of us have the same brutal challenge, survive while making the game without proper funding.

I would love to start asking players more about this topic in order to help devs figure out creative ways to get some revenue while making the game, thus be able to pay the bill and have total focus on making the best game possible without having to take on client work or a second job (and risk getting burnt out)

There's 2 traditional ways top of mind that involves player support

* Sell merch
* Patrion / BMC donations and subscription memberships. 

So my question is, how can a developer earn your support? It's a lot of risk supporting a developer with an unfinished game, what can a developer do to earn that trust?

I'm currently developing my own game and have a [support page setup (Buy me a coffee)](https://buymeacoffee.com/projectucg). I plan to self publish the game. My current approach so far is to include enthusiasts in the process through a V.I.P membership which gives them access to the latest build, continuous updates with behind the scenes material. 

And then periodically have public play sessions to test the game with a wider group of people. ",5,1751833855.0,indiegames,8,0.78,False

Over the four years he was here, I help him out a lot -- drove him to and from the airport every time he traveled home, and let me stay at my house, rent free and no charge for anything. He even had a room in my house. In total, he lived in my house around 7 months. One of those times, the stayed for 4 months because his apartment wasn't ready. The apartment company actually gave him around $8,000 as compensation for the delay. 

Here's the part that bothered me: not once did I get a ""thank you"" or even a small gesture of appreciation. No coffee, no dinner, not even an offer. It left a bad taste in my mouth.

Last month, he graduated. His parents flew in for the ceremony, and I went to pick them up from the airport. On the way, I told my nephew he should finally treat me to a nice meal as a thank-you. I picked a good steakhouse, and at the end of the night, the bill was around $100 per person. He paid it, but I could tell he wasn't happy about it.

Be for others the person I always needed, but never had.

Dust off my skint knees and soothe my dry throat with steaming coffee.  Shrug off a brain trained well to wake early for toil and watch the fog roll beneath the luminous tangle of reds, lavenders, and golds cradling a rising Sun.  Mesmerizing memorizations of insects revealing their identities in the gardens I allowed nature to re-wild.  Spittlebugs, Tumbling Flower Beetles, and Stilt Bugs.  Painted Ladies, Pearl Crescent, and Horace's Duskwing Butterflies.  Sandwasps and Eastern-Tailed Blues.  Long-legged flies, ladybugs and spiders of many iterations.  Southeastern blueberry, honey, longhorned, leafcutter, sweat, and digger bees.

Small new moments where the code clicks and the formula works.  The last coat of paint.  Night walks and standing in the mercy of the rain.  Pushing my last iota of energy to go the extra step and make tasty food into a labor of love...something beautiful meant to be given away.  Donning a mask to hide from any credit for the packages I pass out.  Needs that run the spans of warmth, cooling, health, and hygiene.  Care without words.  Culminations to my introverted relief.  A vicarious replacement for the embrace I crave.

Reclaiming the sullied memories and showing myself that I can control my reality.  Subjecting myself to the whim of woodland isolation and revere how nature keeps my huberous humbled.  Surrender to the lessons in found loneliness.  Waiting eagerly on the first and fourth days of the week.  Treasuring the routine of his soothing voice acknowledging me.  Admiring the wit that accompanies his earthy eyes meeting mine.

Nothing is mine, and everything is potential.  Pain paved a path to endurance...and my tears do not fall for trivial reasons.  Wash and scrub away the past defilements and step forward to absorb a warmer world not clinical, unsterile, and vivid in color.  Light the crackle of wood wick candles sweet with salted vanilla and linen...feel the fire spark in my ocean eyes.  If I have to walk alone in order to save myself, then so be it.

I‚Äôve been working on a free¬†[iOS app called Dial In](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dial-in-coffee/id6746680844), designed to help you log and improve your espresso shots ‚Äî and I‚Äôd love your feedback.

Let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî if you‚Äôre the type who tracks preinfusion to the tenth of a second or distinguishes between inner and outer burr settings, this app¬†*doesn‚Äôt*¬†yet cover all your bases. I expect to get roasted for that, and that‚Äôs fine. That‚Äôs partly why I‚Äôm here.

But here‚Äôs what¬†**Dial In**¬†*does*¬†offer right now:

‚úÖ Quick shot logging (dose, yield, time, grinder setting, notes)  
‚úÖ Instant feedback based on traditional brew ratios or your personal history  
‚úÖ Easy tracking of how your shots evolve across beans, grinders, and days  
‚úÖ A lightweight UI built for speed ‚Äî no accounts or clunky onboarding

What makes it different from other apps:

‚Ä¢ A lot of the current tools either feel dated, require full barista-level knowledge to even get started, or overload you with unnecessary features.  
‚Ä¢ Dial In is designed for people in the middle zone ‚Äî beyond beginner, not quite home roast god ‚Äî who want to improve with less friction.  
‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs mobile-first, minimalist, and works out of the box ‚Äî no integrations or fancy gear required.

What‚Äôs coming soon:

üîú Preinfusion and pressure profiling support  
üîú Multi-device syncing + export  
üîú A beginner walkthrough to help folks new to espresso avoid overwhelm  
üîú Latte art analysis + guidance using your camera  
üîú Community features (sharing shot logs, comparing extractions, etc.)

Would love your feedback ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis sucks, just use a notebook‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis could actually help me dial in faster.‚Äù I‚Äôm not trying to sell anything (it‚Äôs 100% free), just hoping to make it better with input from people who actually care about espresso.

The CEO does.  The CEO lives about half a mile away from me, and we both have suburban houses with living rooms and plenty of space.

The CEO wants to hold meetings with people at our company who work remotely, including me, in his living room.

OK, I can see why that's better than a Starbucks, but is that normal?  Usually meetings are done at an office (even if it's a coworking space), coffee shop or private club, in my experience.",13,1751833290.0,careeradvice,37,0.84,False

Many convergences, interesting to know that not being proficient in arithmetic does not take me away from the status of high skills, it just shows that it is a spectrum and that, everyone here, we have one aspect that is more structured than the other.

If any other Brazilian wants to report their experiences, it would be a pleasure. I'm open to dialogue, maybe a coffee.

In addition to my own work, I do scientific initiation at my university on late-diagnosed grade 1 autism in adults. Therefore, I have a particular interest in neurodiversity: whether it is my own or a third party.",2,1751833256.0,Gifted,4,0.6,False

I'm wearing a navy suit and champagne tie. I have literally no idea what shoe to wear. I'm between a few. Big criteria to me is that they look good (duh), are reusable with other outfits, and will be timeless. Im not a fashion guy so i might be reallly off base with the assessment below.

\-**Black -** Versatile and timeless of course but kind of boring

\-**Chili -** Color looks objectively the best, heard it can be used a lot. Maybe more casual. I worry it will not be as timeless as other colors

\-**Coffee -** I like this as a balance between the coloring of the chilis and the traditionalism of things like black. Like chili could go with a lot of options but will it look too casual?

\-**Mahogany -** Honestly this is just because I dont fit in the burgundies they have available lol. I think it looks  nicer than the black, just a little boring and less versatile.",1,1751833249.0,allenedmonds,15,1.0,False

1ltaxlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ltaxlw/5mg_adderall_after_coffee/,5mg Adderall after coffee?,"Hey team, 39M here about 220lbs, general okay health despite back and hernia issues.  Daily meds are .50 buprenorphine (don‚Äôt do drugs kids) and 10mg Vyvanse during the week and 10mg Adderall IR on weekends.  

I play in a band and we had 2 gigs the last 2 days (we have no crew so we have to set up our full PA, light rig, merch, in-ear monitor systems, recording systems, cameras, etc.) and I am very tired and sore today.

Didn‚Äôt get to bed til 4:30am.  Woke up at 11, took 2.5mg of my adderall IR because I use that on weekends instead of my 10mg Vyvanse.

Had a cup of coffee about 2 or so‚Ä¶ not quite getting me functioning again haha so I took 5mg of my adderall IR to help get going at about 3:30.  

Normally I drink coffee throughout the day when I do take my Vyvanse - no more than 2 cups in a day at the ever very most though and it‚Äôs fairly gradual over the course of the whole day.  Never too much of a problem.  

However I think I‚Äôm feeling a jump in BP that I don‚Äôt normally experience - chest is tight and I just feel‚Ä¶.. pushy in my torso and neck.  Strange sensation!  Is this what elevated blood pressure feels like?

I guess I just want to be assured that I won‚Äôt die haha.  I‚Äôve never taken my Adderall AFTER coffee before (not particularly strong - 3 or so scoops of coffee for the 4 cups water we put in) 

But this is generally something I shouldn‚Äôt do again right?  I don‚Äôt like this feeling.  But just wanna make sure I don‚Äôt need to go to urgent care.  I regret my choice.  


Thanks guys.  Being tired clouded my judgment here I think.  Trying to get laundry and such done after 2 12-hour gig days is tough ü´§ü´§

1ltavll,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1ltavll/aita_for_wanting_my_partner_to_ask_about_seeing_a/,AITA for wanting my partner to ask about seeing a friend in town?,"Let me start off by saying, the answer would have been a ""yes."" It's a childhood best friend, who had moved across country like 10 years back, but we also moved and now are 8-9hrs apart.

My partner and I have been together 11yrs, we have two kids. Ever since we started dating, I saw how her friend, we'll call her Mary, has had almost a hold on anyone within her inner circle. If Mary is around and has plans, there's almost an expectation for people to comply. She'll express an understanding of people having families and whatnot, but those friends act almost like it's an obligation.

Takes us to today. It's naptime, lazy day, no plans. Partner gets a call, it's Mary. Turns out Mary and her family are passing through our area, and are stopping for coffee. My partner was about to cut our oldest's hair, stops and says ""His haircut can wait. Mary is passing through, I'm going to go see her. I don't know when I'll get to see her again.""

The only question ever asked was, ""Can we afford for me to get a drink?"" They were meeting at a Starbucks.
Off she zipped, shortly after our youngest woke up, in a terrible toddler mood.

There have been numerous experiences like this where Mary comes around, and my partner makes her top priority. Even if I'm asked about the plans, there's basically a pressure to say yes, and I'd be an asshole because it's one of her best friends.

Multiple times I've tried to have conversations about her relationship with Mary, and the control it seems like Mary has, and it always gets thrown back at me because, ""You don't have a best friend like her, so you don't understand."" Or, ""what if my family came to town, could I not just go and see them?"" Just anything and everything to poke holes. The main thing I am simply asking for is just some communication any time it comes to making plans, because relationships thrive off communication. But again, everytime it just blows up in my face when I try to talk about it.

So, idk if I'm the asshole, if maybe I'm just not approaching things in the right way? Maybe it's just something I don't understand *because* I don't have a relationship like what she has with Mary?",1,1751832949.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False
