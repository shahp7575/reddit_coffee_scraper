1hhiz8p,https://i.redd.it/msq1wqgkyp7e1.jpeg,review #11: Ron Zacapa 23,"before the review, i want to disclose that i am fully aware of why ron zacapa 23 is controversial, and i agree it is for good reason. i stumbled upon it by chance at a local shop going out of business. it was the best they had and i was able to buy it at a decent price. that being said, on with the review:


~


rum: Ron Zacapa 23

base: cane honey

producer: Industrias Licoreras de Guatemala

distillation: column still

abv: 40% (80 proof)

aging: blend of 6-23 year old rums, mostly younger with a small portion of the latter.

dosage: ~20 g/L

~

nose: oak, ripe bananas, honey, caramel, cherries, figs, candied almonds

palate: oak, honey, caramel, medium roast coffee, black cherries, dates, flamb√© bananas, sticky rice, tingly spice with a touch of citrus

finish: short but pleasant; honey, apple, orange peel

thoughts: this was honestly quite better than i expected. thankfully, it does not taste corporate, or not exactly. the 20 g/L dosage is not very noticeable to me. zacapa 23 is certainly ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù, but not in a way that would indicate added sugar if tasted blind. what really seems to shine in this rum is the barrel influence, which provides a warm and familiarly sweet profile, but not in a sugary way, rather a fruity and somewhat spicy way. that banana note (not the funky kind) has quite a longevity to it. zacapa 23 is a tad better than your standard ‚Äúrum for bourbon drinkers‚Äù, but at the same time could be enjoyed by someone in that vein. my biggest complaint is of course going to be the finish, which completely washes away in a matter of seconds. this is of course likely to be a result of the low proof, despite the rum‚Äôs decent mouthfeel before subsiding.

1hhiyi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1hhiyi5/25f_chronic_acid_refluxgerd/,25F Chronic Acid Reflux/GERD,"I never had any stomach issues up until my early 20s when I was getting recurrent UTIs after intercourse with my previous partner. I was put on a cocktail of different antibiotics, and still till this day suffer with what seems like nerve damage and incontinence. I started to gradually have stomach issues ‚Äî specifically with alcohol. Whenever I would drink, I would get stomach/acid pain. Sometimes the pain would be so sharp I couldn't move. I would eat bananas and sweet potatoes to try and alleviate the pain and acid in my stomach. 

As time went on, I tried to test more with alcohol as I was still young, in my early 20s and very much in denial with my reality at the time. I would notice days after drinking alcohol I would have bloating, lots of gas, sometimes constipation, etc. It was bad, however, not bad enough to where I would give up alcohol. Fast forward to present day, I can no longer drink coffee without feeling like there is a ball in my throat and profusely burping. Additionally, now when I drink alcohol I have strange neck sensations. My throat will feel sore, and my neck will start to feel itchy, however, there are no hives or visible markings on my neck. I went to the doctor's a few months back for my alcohol issue, and they basically just told me to avoid my triggers and take antacids. I was also prescribed famotidine for two months earlier this year, taking it before breakfast, lunch and dinner. It helped for a bit, but during this time I was drinking alcohol therefore the acid reflux naturally came back. After being scarred from taking so many antibiotics, I actively try to avoid taking any meds unless I am in excruciating pain. I have not stopped drinking and my acid reflux is getting worse so now I am back on Omeprazole, and I am on my seventh day of the 14 day course. The neck pain freaks me out the most, I haven't drank any alcohol or coffee for seven days now but I still sometimes feel the itchy feeling in my neck. Additionally, I have never had issues with matcha but more recently when I drink matcha my neck has also been feeling itchy. Does anyone else have any similar experiences? No one in my family has any stomach issues nearly as bad as I do, however, my uncle on my maternal size had stomach cancer. All of this is so new and very SCARY to me and I feel like an alien as I am in my mid 20s and want to go out and be social, but fear the repercussions to come after a night out. I have no one in my life who can relate to me, but I am day by day trying to reframe my thinking and be positive. I am trying to enter 2025 on a good note, and be more optimistic!

This is a time of year many are in the kitchen preparing for the holidays. It makes me remember my own grandmother and her recipes, her tips and tricks to cooking. I can‚Äôt help but wonder what kind of knowledge used to be passed down from the older generations in the kitchen. Tips that made recipes great. 

Please take a moment to remember who first inspired you to love cooking or who had an older loved one let them into the kitchen during this time of year to watch them bake. What did you learn from them that we can all benefit from because not everyone here had that in their lives. Some of us started with the internet and not grandmothers. 

I‚Äôll go first. Here is a recipe for frosting I picked up as a kid hanging out with an older lady that owned and operated a small restaurant in the town I grew up in. Here is her ‚Äòsecret‚Äô cinnamon roll frosting. 

1 tsp vanilla,
1 tsp melted butter,
A few drops almond extract,
1 tsp coffee from yesterday,
Mix in enough powdered sugar to make a frosting. Start with 1/2 cup but continue to add until you get the desired consistency. This amount varies with differences in wet ingredients and has to be done by feel or mood. 

I remember this frosting being made when I was barely tall enough to see over the counter and she would add the coffee directly from the mug she was drinking from. Not something you can get away with nowadays. She told me the best was to use coffee from yesterday. What other tips or tricks might be lost to the sands of time?",1,1734575403.0,Baking,0,1.0,False

My husband and I have an LMNT subscription, and pre-pregnancy I loved them. Now I associate them with vomiting, which means I gag even if I open the package to consider having one. 

I want to be able to use some kind of electrolytes because I‚Äôm nervous about getting dehydrated and have been getting calf cramps. Has anyone tried Instant hydration packets? I have tried liquid iv (too sweet) and drip drop (more like a hint of flavor). But I‚Äôve been getting so many ads for this instant hydration company. Are they good?

1hhij6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hhij6p/just_an_embarrassing_story_that_i_need_to_get_off/,Just an embarrassing story that I need to get off my chest,"I (23F) just started a new job at a big company. I work in a skyscraper and have my own office. Literally a dream job - I‚Äôm so excited and do not want to mess anything up. For context: my company owns three floors in the building, my office is on the uppermost floor. The office has a policy that most employees only need to be in the office 2 days per week, so most days the office is pretty empty - especially my floor. 

Today (my third day at the job) I accidentally woke up a bit late and hastily grabbed a pair of pants draped over my dresser and threw them on while getting dressed (this is important for later). I park in a ramp about a 15 min walk from my building (parking nearby is crazy expensive). I made it the entire walk and into my office not noticing anything amiss. About 30 minutes into my day, I get up to use the bathroom (coffee am i right?). Again, I notice nothing amiss. One hour later I get up again. I am gone for maybe 5-7 minutes. However, this time when I walk back to my office, a black pair of panties is laying outside my office door. I immediately know they are mine and literally move at the speed of light to grab them and run into my office and shut the door. I think the last time I wore my pants (they were jeans - I wash every 2-3 wears ok?) was out for drinks with my friends, and I had taken them off with my underwear at the same time. Normally, I would remove my underwear and throw them in the laundry right away (I promise I am a hygienic person), but I assume in my drunken state I must have just dropped my pants and gone to bed, forgetting my underwear was still in there when folding them on my dresser the next day. Anyway, somehow in my rush this morning, I must have pulled the pants on with the loose underwear still in there and it must have been slowly falling down the pants leg until it fell out the second time I got up.  

I‚Äôm almost positive no one saw my thong on the floor - as I was only gone for a few minutes and I‚Äôm pretty sure there was only one other person working in-office on my floor at that point. But I am so terrified that someone did see them or that somehow they had been there for longer and I missed them. Anyways, I feel so embarrassed by the whole thing and feel too humiliated to talk to my friends family or boyfriend about it. How did I make it through a trek across the city and one full trip to the bathroom without realizing a pair of panties was loose in my pants???? I‚Äôm an idiot. If anyone has any comforting stories to share in my pain, please let me know. Otherwise you can just laugh at me lol  ",3,1734575115.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

1hhihl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/JCBWritingCorner/comments/1hhihl4/pretending_to_be_a_space_marine_at_a_magic_school/,Pretending to be a Space Marine at a Magic School,"Hey everyone! Here is something that is very much about the nature of man. More specifically, about the Imperium of Man from Warhammer 40,000. It was a fun concept to have the xenocide lovers go straight to a realm of ~~heresy~~ magic and figure stuff out. How would it go?

Just a little disclaimer here. I really wanted to write ‚ÄòImperium of Man Visits Nexus‚Äô or ‚ÄòGUN made Emma Astartes‚Äô, but there is an inherent problem with both of them. In the first, the Imperium will no doubt go in, see that there is magic, remember that magic is heresy and then launch a full-on purging campaign against the Nexus. Not how school works. As for the second one, remember that Astartes as all boys gang. So I made a compromise. In this little story, Emma received enhanced genetic augmentations like Spartans from Halo. This was to make a few things more manageable, and still let more-or-less a normal human rock the Astartes Power Armor.

But G.U.N. is not the Imperium. So I improvised! Basically there was a post on r/humansarespaceorcs a few months back, titled something like ‚ÄòAliens think Warhammer 40K is real‚Äô. Well guess what, we can fool the magic medieval into thinking that, they literally don‚Äôt even know tech or grimdark.

So here is what I‚Äôve randomly written, about G.U.N. pretending to be the Imperium and BSing their way in as they right fully should.

***Note-*** *This is in no way meant to desecrate the original work, or the Warhammer lore. It‚Äôs just an idea I got and went ahead for the laughs. I assure you that while some things might be accurate, others would be outright random. Because we have this, uh, thing here.*

Also, special thanks to u/Alternative_Tart3560 for giving me the original 'Imperium visits Nexus' idea!

^(Thank you for attending my Ted Talk.)

\----------

When we asked the Nexus to call us ‚ÄòG.U.N.‚Äô or simply ‚ÄòHumanity‚Äô, they ignored it and just called us ‚ÄòEarthrealmers‚Äô.

So we were all naturally very, veeerry much weirded out when they addressed us as ‚ÄòThe Imperium of Man‚Äô.

At first it was dismissed as language trouble- we‚Äôd been having trouble translating their ‚ÄòHigh Nexian‚Äô and they were very much having trouble with English, and that too just for sending us written messages that we could actually read.

*But said designations continued, and so did a few other things which sounded like a mash up of Latin stuff.*

First there were words like ‚ÄòAdeptus Administratum‚Äô, and a bunch of others just prefixed with ‚ÄòAdeptus‚Äô on them. The linguists were internally freaking out, and Command thought that they were fools of the first order.

I mean seriously, what is a Mechaico-, no, mechanico, no no no‚Ä¶ Mechanicus! Yes, that‚Äôs the one. What in the name of hell was that? And what‚Äôs up with letters addressed to some Emperor? Sure, the spooks down in R&D knew that this ‚ÄòNexus‚Äô was backwards and had a king, but I guess it could only be logical that they referred to our brass as ‚ÄòEmperor‚Äô- they think we‚Äôve got kings‚Ä¶ not that they know any better.

*But interpreting any of this is leagues above my paygrade, so off I went to training without a second thought.*

Little did I know that this whole operation just got practically handed to the spooks because of one single lab tech‚Äôs fault.

When I say that tab techs are the most deranged humans in existence, *I am not joking.*

*They are* ***freaks****.*

Because the fools sent in a fictional book to the Nexus. They asked us for a few literary works and other things like dictionaries to communicate better, and being 5 months away from arrival, we sent them what they asked for through the portals they opened for fleeting seconds. Of course, to prevent a‚Ä¶ disintegrated fate like Pilot-1, this was done remotely via robotic arms that just chucked stuff into the portal.

*Well, guess what?* One of the techs was reading something called ‚ÄòCodex: Space Marines‚Äô and accidently left that book in the pile of books meant to be thrown straight into another plane of existence. And off it went. Even since that, we‚Äôve been addressed as the ‚ÄòImperium of Man‚Äô, and majority of mission parameter control went straight to the spooks who were ready to capitalize on it.

*The strategy was simple*. If they think we‚Äôre some over-the-top super powerful empire with immense power, we give them that. And while the G.U.N. glitter was really good, we just found that if we pretended hard enough, we could pull it off. I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre actually pretending to be this faction that the Nexus believes us to be, just to outright lie about our capabilities and stuff, which was further highlighted by the fact that the medieval folk out there thought that *we‚Äôd just sent them our entire military doctrine.*

*And so command had turned to a few people that they considered ‚Äònot completely insane‚Äô and asked what was necessary to pull such a stunt off. Of course they weren‚Äôt given details, we just extracted info from them.*

And the second they got the go-ahead from Command? *The lab freaks went bonkers.*

*Not because of them being so orky with their methods- that‚Äôs acceptable- but because of their whole ‚Äòwhy not?‚Äô attitude. And maybe the fact that one of them happens to be a Warhammer fanatic. No, I did not say fan- when I said fanatic, I meant it.*

Because the fools made the E-ARRS look like an A-start-ees. Whatever that is.

On first look it was‚Ä¶ powerful. It looked powerful, at least. And the 8 foot tall hulking behemoth that overshadowed the actual standard G.U.N. power armor was also ‚Äòenchanted‚Äô- meant to specifically resist this ‚Äòmana‚Äô radiation.

*But of course the eggheads needed it ‚Äòlore accurate‚Äô, whatever even classifies as that, because just the other day I heard someone in that lab say ‚Äòeverything‚Äôs canon‚Äô.*

I am concerned about this.

I mean the **mission**. I‚Äôm concerned about the *mission*. These people are too far gone to be concerned about.

So one might be wondering why I‚Äôm sitting in front of a lab tech from the same race of freaks, and listening to his rambling since an hour. Oh yeah, because it was ‚Äòvital‚Äô to the mission. Sure, listening to tech-edgelords is important to the mission.

I could be training with the Diplomatic Corps right now, but noo I must stay here.

*At least he‚Äôs reaching the exciting parts, he‚Äôs been reading safety manuals since the last hour or so.*

‚ÄúSo you see, Cadet Booker, that we have successfully increased the size of the armor. With increase in size comes more additions in terms of tech, and with tech comes more power. The ‚Äòbackpack‚Äô is similar to standard power armor, and the software is the same. You shouldn‚Äôt even feel a difference, but the thing is that this specific thing requires a few more genetic mods and better stims. Normally we‚Äôd been thinking of implanting an extra lung and heart,‚Äù My actual heart stopped at that, ‚Äú-but HIGHCOM doesn‚Äôt want the risks of ‚Äòcool‚Äô over utility. So the titanium implants along bones are also off the chart.‚Äù Oh thank whichever star was responsible for not letting these eggheads make a garbled mess of me.

*He goes over a few more details, and I try my best to remember his name without letting it show that I had in fact, forgotten it for the umpteenth time. I thought so hard that it honestly must have drained a sizeable portion of my lifeforce away, but at long last I remembered that he was called John.*

‚ÄúSo finally just one more genetic implant and-‚Äú

‚ÄúJohn, sir, I‚Äôm sorry but this kind of detail is beyond my scope.‚Äù

‚ÄúJohn? He‚Äôs on sick leave, I‚Äôm Dan.‚Äù

I was dumbfounded for a moment as I thought my memory failed me, but he continued to explain that they were twins. And now I have to worry about them using telekinesis too, because they are twins. Great.

After another awkward conversation I walked out of the small room straight into another room, and was instantly hit with the pungent odour of all sorts of chemicals. One final augmentation, and it‚Äôll be over. It‚Äôs not much, they said- just a bit of a dose of ‚Äòeternal coffee‚Äô as they call it.

I was strapped down to a tilted table, and for the first time since the augmentations it hit me a bit hard- the difference. I used to be about 5‚Äô10 earlier, and out of the candidates was on the ‚Äòshorter‚Äô side. But after the augmentations, our height and strengths were greatly enhanced- which meant that my 6‚Äô8 was still ‚Äòshort‚Äô, but my unholy luck ensured that I was thankfully one of the ones who didn‚Äôt get crippled for life during the procedures. And thanks to my relations to Auntie Ran, I‚Äôm here now.

The needle came down at me- attached to a servo arm. The crystal blue liquid disappeared as my vision faded to black.

*One last step.*

***One final resolution.***

\---

After a thousand years of pain I finally awoke, only to realize that I‚Äôd been out for two hours. Such was the relativity of time. This was the final augmentation, and now I‚Äôd finally get to wear the ‚Äòenchanted‚Äô power armor.

The restraints from my arms and legs were removed and I was led to a sideroom where the techsuit was put on. It hung loose, and then gradually tightened around me slowly. It was gray and had several bracings and straps which would latch onto the insides of the armor.

Once the techsuit was on I was led to another room by Dan and a few other techs, this time in full hazmats. I was led onto a slightly raised cylindrical surface, and told to spread out my arms to grab the handles of what was a thin ring vertically mounted to the overhead assembly machine. The second I grabbed the handles, my hands were kept in place by braces and my feet too were strapped to the ground. Then the floor itself opened, several servo arms and assembly machines began building the suit around me. The huge composite alloy parts wrapped around me perfectly, and in seconds the first layer was done- I looked around and could see the servos and mechanisms- somewhat ugly yet beautiful in their own right- and then my back stiffened as the chestplates‚Äô base pieces locked into place.

Then the external layers began to form up around me- the gunmetal blue fit perfectly in place and covered up the delicate interior. It took a good five minutes, but the armor was now on me, and suddenly the power flicked on and I could finally move around. The shoulder pauldrons and other oversuit pieces were quick to be attached, and it left an imposing helmetless figure in the room that bore the colors and flag of the Greater United Nations of Earth, and a weird inverted Ohm symbol on a shoulder.

*It felt so, so fluid. I could barely feel any weight- even without the calibrations- such was the extent of augmentation. It was amazing, and I felt even better as the haptic response systems kicked in and I could essentially ‚Äòfeel‚Äô everything around me. There was a whirring sound and as I looked up, the final piece descended.*

The helmet came down slowly and I looked forward to it- literally. The intricate helmet latched onto the suit, the mag-locks clicking in place. The visor wasn‚Äôt there- I could see just fine with my eyes, and knew that the visor would only lower and fill my vision when I wanted it to.

The helmet compacted, and its various external layers clicked and contracted a little till they felt comfortable, and the restrains were then lifted away. I walked forward, almost wincing at how loud a single boot of composite metal felt on solid metal grating. I came to the calibration station, and then the lights went off. A single strobing red light could be seen in the distance, and suddenly the red-tinted opaque lens came into my view, lowering from the inside of the helmet itself.

*My eyes could no longer be seen from the outside- all that could be seen were two slightly angry opaque eyes that seemed to almost glow red in the dark.*

The calibrations further removed weight from me, and the 8 foot tall suit I now inhabited seemed almost natural. Almost‚Ä¶ perfect.

Thereon the interface booted up, and the EVI greeted me with a curt ‚ÄòWelcome‚Äô, before relegating itself to the background to face more important tasks than making itself known to the user. My requested presets were already here, and the comm notification told me to move to the IAS Portal room immediately.

I was given an adequately sized firearm to use with this hunk of blue, and I gladly accepted what was essentially an overgrown pistol. But it had the firepower so I didn‚Äôt feel the need to question anyone about it.

¬†

*So yes, I am about to go into a parallel dimension of magic and pretend to be this‚Ä¶ thing here. I‚Äôve even been given the rank of ‚ÄòChapter Master‚Äô. While the techs said that this is in no way the correct verbiage, Command thought that giving me a rank that was technically high could be helpful in a Nexus where most students were nobles and such.*

*And boy, oh boy have I been given the strangest of knowledge about what I am to say there. Apparently, I am Chapter Master Emma Booker of some ‚ÄòUltramarines‚Äô Chapter as per Command (and because of which I had to hear ear-shattering amounts of ‚Äòlore‚Äô from various edgelords), and I belong to the Imperium of Man and was going to the Nexus to represent humanity. Poetic, to be honest. Greet xenos with someone known for xenocide. No, not genocide- that would imply that they aren‚Äôt xenos. Don‚Äôt give me that look, Dan said that too.*

*And this armor was supposedly made by some cultist tech support people called the Mechanicus, who worship decaying product manuals and pray to make-believe stuff to make tech they don‚Äôt understand work. Humans are invited to a magic realm. Humans start a conversation with a lie. Excellent. When I pointed that out, all I received was ‚ÄòYou are Alpharius‚Äô.*

¬†

As I walked out, I saw a reflection in a mirror. The armor was imposing sure, but it made the standard armor look smaller in comparison. I wouldn‚Äôt doubt it if the ‚Äòsmaller‚Äô armor could beat this hulk, but the intimidation factor was strictly for this Astartes, as it is called, which Dan told me over the comms. He actually transferred the original design for this armor to me, and I couldn‚Äôt decide whether to be amazed or horrified by it. The original design was of an ‚ÄòUltramarine‚Äô, as it was called, and had golden wings with a skull in the smack center of the chestplate.

Even the backpack had a skull with an inverted ohm logo, and the shoulder pauldrons had what looked like a ceramite skull with actual gold text below. Another skull was strapped to the top part of the helmet and a kneecap of the armor, and the pistol I received, even it can be called that, was supposed to have a skull on each side. Thank whatever high command brass decided to not go with this insanity- if we wanted to kill off the Nexus, a nuke would do, but this‚Ä¶ this thing would give them nightmares. Especially because one of the variants of the original design had a skull as the frontpiece of the helmet. I did look classy though‚Ä¶

I recited the U.N. code of conduct mentally as I strode down the long hallway that led straight to the portal. I had given up everything to be here- friends, family, hell. I‚Äôd given up a real college and straight up was giving up any contact with my civilization for at least an year- but I wouldn‚Äôt give up my loyalties.

I could hear the Director make a speech via the comms- everybody listened in and I grew a bit nervous. Thankfully the layers upon layers of metal did an impeccable job at hiding that.

The second I entered the room, it was sealed off and I could see the telltale signs of the portal powering up- the sparks from the power coils cast a brilliant white now and then, and the Director and I shared a few words before I stepped away from this world of technology.

1hhigao,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hhigao/beginners_story_is_espresso_mostly_just_a_hobby/,Beginner's Story: Is Espresso Mostly Just a Hobby?,"For the past month or so, I've been on a quest / rabbit hole in figuring out which espresso machine to buy, coming in as a rookie to this new field for me. After maybe \~50 hours of youtubing and combing through reddit, I've somehow convinced myself that I should buy an ECM synch ii, along with a Niche Zero. Along with all the other accessories I'll need, I'm looking at around $5k. I've been contemplating whether this would be a rational purchase, and I can't quite figure out if it would.

Here's the paradox I'm seeing: it seems like you need to move up to a dual boiler if you're making milk-based espresso machines often. The ones that caught my eye are all $3k and up. But to me, the paradox is that if you're making milk-based drinks, why does it matter if the espresso is perfectly made - won't the taste get drowned out anyway? An analogy for liquor would be buying a $100 bottle of whiskey/brandy/whatever, and just making a sweet-n-sour drink with it. You could have just used a $15 bottle and had the same result. So then, wouldn't a high-end, ""prosumer"" espresso machine really only make sense if you're drinking espresso ""neat"" (or at most, a macchiato, maybe even cortado)? But once you move to cappuccinos and lattes, can you really tell the difference of an espresso brewed by a $3k machine vs. a Bambino or even cheaper? If there's relatively no difference in taste to the majority of people (maybe some people have a super refined palette, I don't know), then the only advantage you're getting from a much more expensive machine is saving a few seconds (dual boiler lets you steam simultaneously, better machines can steam quicker, etc.). But I imagine most of us are only making 1 or 2 drinks per day 360 days a year, and maybe 5 days we have some guests over, needing to make them back-to-back. On this point: worth the $2500 difference? Maybe, maybe not.

  
I can't imagine that many people with espresso setups in the thousands of dollars are mostly drinking neat espressos, or whatever you call them in the coffee world :). So then, does it just boil down to: espresso is a hobby / way of life? Because to me it doesn't make sense going through all the hoops of getting the perfect grinder, perfect espresso machine, dialing your pulls in, and so on, if you're just drinking milk-based espresso drinks anyway (or honestly probably even americanos).

Curious if anyone else has gone through this. Did you mostly go through with all this just for a new hobby (or just for the sake of getting new toys), or did it actually open new doors in terms of taste / quality of drinks?

1hhifoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hhifoh/my_partners_health_is_really_weighing_down_on_me/,My partner‚Äôs health is really weighing down on me.,"My partner and I have been together since March. He is the most wonderful, kindest, and most caring partner I have been with and my first healthy relationship with a person who I can actually see potentially being in my future.

My partner has faced a series of unfortunate events with his health since basically the start of the relationship. We have only had a solid 6-8 normal weeks together, and it is getting really hard having to see people do regular couple things and have normal relationships. Everything crumbled at the blink of an eye. 

The first thing that happened was my partner caught an illness due to contaminated water at the nursing home he works at. It was absolutely horrible, he was down for literally the entire summer. He lives alone, I am in his apartment the majority of the time, but I do have my own place to go back to. I was washing him, dressing and undressing him, cleaning and making sure he was well-fed. I missed out on properly celebrating my birthday plus an entire summer of activity, which is the only break period I have each year since I am a student. I did not see or do anything with anyone. Friends, family, anyone. I was locked in the house caring for him until the start of the next semester. But I did it because I care, of course. 

Immediately after recovering from his illness and at the beginning of my semester, he was injured at work and has been disabled ever since with no end in sight. He is unable to walk without assistance of a cane, or me. He is receiving workers comp and it is barely enough to even cover rent, let alone anything else. The fridge has been empty for months. He has lost dozens of pounds. I am breaking my paychecks to support him and I am really just upset that I am not having the experiences in a relationship that I want to have. We have only been on one date. We have been together for nearly a year and 90% of our relationship has been us locked in the house. I am always buying food for two, always buying groceries for two. I am running through money and effort that I need to be dedicating to succeeding in my studies. I am trying to not sound selfish, but I genuinely do not enjoy struggling with men. Every time I have stuck my neck out for men in the past and helped them at their lowest, they have showed me nothing but apathy when I reach my lowest. If I was not here, this man would literally have absolutely nothing to eat or drink. Not even a bottle of water. He‚Äôd literally starve. The electricity nearly got cut off last week. 

My partner is incredibly kind and selfless. He will refuse to take bites out of my food even though I can hear his stomach grumbling. If he has even $10, he will use it on me. He will wake me up if he knows I did not eat, he cannot sleep if he knows I ate nothing that day. Even disabled, he will stand and go cook something for me. Even if it‚Äôs as simple as a pot of white rice and absolutely nothing else. He is a kind man, he is a good man. He always encourages me to go home, saying he‚Äôll be fine. Dude, how can I go home when I know you‚Äôll be in this apartment, alone, with nothing to eat? You cannot even stand in the shower by yourself. 

Being a caretaker in any capacity is extremely hard on the mind and soul. I was a CNA for several years, and while I do feel compassion and love for my partner, it is insanely difficult to feel completely responsible for the welfare of another person. All the time. For this long. I get it, in sickness and in health. But as selfish as this sounds, I have pondered leaving him several times as I cannot continue missing out on my life to take care of another person who has been ill in some way for nearly a year and will continue to be ill for god knows how long. We have only been on one date and we have hardly any pictures together. We‚Äôve shared barely any nice, memorable experiences. Every day is the exact same. Get up, go on the couch, wonder where the next meal will come from, checking the bank account and seeing that you only have $0.43, repeat. Every. Single. Day. Wake up, go on the couch and watch mindless TV. Nothing else. He doesn‚Äôt even want to open up the blinds on the window. It literally just feels like we are two bums shacking up together but stay together in the name of love. I love my partner and he knows that. But god, it is frustrating sometimes. There is no toilet paper in the house. No hand soap, no money to do laundry. Same bed sheets for months. Wearing the same pair of underwear for multiple weeks because there‚Äôs no detergent. I am a full time student and a part time worker and dedicating this amount of effort into supporting a grown man is getting exhausting. I want to take a walk around the park with you. I want to hold hands in public, I want to go to the local caf√© and share a cup of coffee with you. I want to actually feel like I am in a RELATIONSHIP. I just want him to fucking get better already so I can actually feel like I am someone‚Äôs partner and not their caretaker. Our entire relationship has been like this.

We text on birthdays and holidays, maybe go for  coffee or lunch a couple times a year. It's the usual kind of backstory: He doesn't bother to be in my life or my kids' lives unless he wamts something, I rather prefer him not in my life now that I understand how emotionally (and, rarely, physically) abusive he was when I was growing up, etc.

About eight weeks ago, he texted‚ÄîTEXTED‚Äîmy brother and I to let us know our grandfather had passed away. Not only that he had passed away, but that he had passed away *the night before.* 

Today, he calls me during my workday. I didn't answer because, yeah, I'm at work, in a meeting with a VP, and busy. Ten minutes later, he calls again, then texts to say, ""hey, [my name], call me as soon as you have the chance."" Now I'm thinking, ""OMG, what happened that's this urgent??"" 

So as soon as I'm done my meeting, I do not pass Go, do not collect $200, I go straight to a private phone room and call him back, expecting something devastating has happened. 

You probably already know it was nothing of the sort. 

He so urgently called repeatedly and texted me, during my workday and his, to ask if he could come over on Sunday to say hello. 

What. The. Fuck. 

And now I'm pissed at myself for once again trusting enough to be sent for a ride on this rollercoaster. Because of course, this isn't the first time. 

He VERY URGENTLY needed my help with getting my mom's signature on a legal document that was not actually needed for a few more weeks, but couldn't be bothered to tell me he took his new partner‚Äîwho's about my age‚Äîoff on a trip to propose to her, until I saw her ring and asked directly. 

He can't remember my kids' birthdays, but he never failed to call me repeatedly asking for money a few years ago (that's what led to us being LC). 

He can't remember how many fucking grandkids he has to put them in his own father's obituary, but when he needs pictures for the slideshow for the memorial service next month it's daily email reminders. 

And speaking of, we wouldn't want to interrupt his holiday plans to have a timely funeral. Fuck it, that shit can wait. What's important is the price he paid for the non-refundable plane tickets. 

I am so sick of this shit. And I hate how I feel all this grief and anger and sadness and just EVERYTHING whenever stupid shit like this happens. It's far from the worst shit he's ever done, but it didn't happen in a vacuum, either. ",3,1734574767.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

1hhif6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/s/fMpDxtCkIg,My roommate is very... stupid [UPDATE],"Back by semi popular (not really i needed to vent again) demand, my roommate. 

Sigh, these past weeks have been‚Ä¶ I shouldn‚Äôt say torture but it was definitely trying.

Firstly, thanks for the heating pad advice, putting it in the freezer did wonders for it. Now for the rant block. I‚Äôd like to put time into context by labeling before thanksgiving break, what I assume was during the break, and after.

Before break:

I‚Äôve had to reset my boundaries with her again, and a piece of that was reiteration of pitching in with buying common use items (dish soap, paper towels, etc.).
Not even an hour later one of her friends sent me a few dollars for dish soap‚Ä¶ Now, dont get me wrong, it's okay to ask for help sometimes... but as I stood in front of the mirror that hangs on the back of my door, staring at myself and accepting that I exist beyond my own self; perceived when absent; I realized how embarrassing that was for a grown woman with a steady job, stable income, AND parents who give her money, to refuse to go halfsies on common use items used by us both and that her FRIEND sent me those few dollars.

I‚Äôve actually brought this up a lot, the whole going half on common items, and had I not had a small crisis in a mirror I wouldn‚Äôt have realized she genuinely is doing everything in her power to avoid paying halfsies.
She gets paid bimonthly, as we all do, and also makes more than me üò≠. I don‚Äôt think cheap could define her! What's worse than cheap!!?

Digressing, remember that guy from before? The one she‚Äôs extra cruel too? Ah, well, let‚Äôs just say she gets worse. Beginning week of November he had TWO separate relatives pass. He was close to them from what I could deduce when he came over. He told us, roommate and I, about the sudden passings of his relatives and began to cry as any sane person would. After? She was going on and on to me about how much of a ‚Äòpussy‚Äô he was because he was crying. Because his close relatives suddenly passed away. IN THE SAME WEEK‚Ä¶

During break:

Imagine, you‚Äôve just gone home for the week to your parents house, the relationship is a tense one in general, so you‚Äôre extra stressed.

You come back to the safety of your dorm, you‚Äôre tired, you just want dinner. You would‚Äôve stopped somewhere but as your mama always said, you got food at home.
So there I was, cheffing it up, I‚Äôm half dead but I‚Äôm still going making some simple SEASONED fried fish (not deep fried) and rice. My rice cooker was on, cooking my rice, I turn the ire on high, set the pan on and as I wait for it to heat up I step away for a moment to put a couple things into my room.

Fatal mistake. 

As I‚Äôm putting those things away the acrid, sulfuric smell of burnt ass coffee (read as: ‚Äò[burnt chicken nugget](https://youtu.be/fjn4H8Zy3pc)‚Äô) assaults my senses violently. Then I see the smoking.

I had to open all the windows to avoid setting the fire alarm off. Colder than Jack Frosts pinkie toe out, and now there‚Äôs caramelized coffee on the stove and every single time it‚Äôs turned on it begins smoking heavily. I'm assuming she spilled coffee and didn't clean it up and of course, i didn't realize. 
All i wanted was some fish and rice. 

I long for the days of my ignorance to the possibility someone like this truly exists.

After.

Id post the picture of the damage done to the ire but since I sent her the photo and a small text block about how unhygienic that is, and inconvenient that mess was, I don‚Äôt think I should post it. However. Let me tell you Reddit, you would‚Äôve been GOBSMACKED.

This is less of a rant piece more of an annoyance, but for the entirety of the week, finals week, she keeps bringing friends over so late, 10pm and beyond.
They‚Äôd stay in the living area, being loud. Playing music on a speaker, shrieking and laughing. Until deep into the night. i'm talking 1, 2 sometimes 3 am. 

The first night this happened, I told her to please keep it down as I had a lot to do tomorrow and needed to get sleep and I‚Äôll give it to her they did quiet down. The next day, I asked her that if she was going to bring a friend or two over late at night, just for this week, /Finals Week/, to please stay in her room with them.

Did that happen? No. Have all my patience been tested? Yes.

I‚Äôve talked to accommodations they are aiming to get me a single apartment for the coming semester. I can‚Äôt do anything right now but endure.( ;-;).

A life of a stray dog is never easy to survive!

The director of this rescue group Destination Rescue Dogs saw a plea yesterday for a dog in a construction site & not moving. No transport was found to help last night to take the dog to the ER so the director herself went out this morning and he was still laying in the exact same spot as last night. She put him in her car and immediately took him to NVC Nederland.
He cried in pain the whole way there. He was in pretty bad shape. He was dropped off at NVC around 11:00 am and expect him to stay there several days. He‚Äôs estimated to be about 5-7yrs old and was named Peanut Butter üß°
He got some X-Rays (was very painful but necessary) and determinate he has a colon dial teared and filled with stool so will get an enema this evening. He got blood transfusion (was anemic) and was put on IV fluids for the night and see how he is doing in the morning. The fracture is right up by the head of the femur so is going to be a tricky and expensive surgery üòï.
He needs to be more stable and well enough to proceed though. He does also have some slight congestion with his lungs most likely from the heartworms because he tested positive üò•

Peanut Butter was meant to be saved, and his rescue is determined to do anything to have a full recovery. 

WE ask you to put a hand in your heart and think about your dog, could be him!...we will do whatever is need it to save their lives right? Peanut Butter is alive and fighting! HE WANTS TO LIVE!

PLEASE ANY AMOUNT IS WELCOME, as we know ER VETS are really much expensive than a regular veterinarian! Can you sacrifice a cup of coffee? This rescue is small but has a big heart and needs YOUR HELP so please ALSO SHARE!!

I took PSYO 111 this semester as my science, but did anyone else have a weird exam experience with it? I walk into the room 2 days ago at 8:30 PM, ART 110, nobody there. Check my exam schedule, I'm right on time. There's only the examiner there, claims my prof is sick. Motions for me to sit down, and so I sit and wait. I'm nervous because I'm the only person here, so maybe I was busted for cheating by searching up a few answers for the in-class questions. Examiner hands me an ""exam"" 5 minutes before 8:30. It's really thin, only a single few pages, not including the explanation page. At this point I'm dripping sweat. Like shit, is my life over for using Google? It's not AI, they can't ruin me for this, right? I flinch as I hear the clock on the wall tick. One minute. The examiner is avoiding my eyes. I'm fucked, aren't I? 

""Time begins now."" This woman says. She sounds bored, like she's done this a million times before. I flip over my paper, and pale. about 10 questions total. Eight multiple choice, two long answer. There's no way, right? One of the multiple choice only says ""To love."" The answers are all my friend's names, and D is my name. This has to be a joke, right? some kind of clich√© horror bullshit? I'm overthinking this, and I raise my hand because what else am I meant to do? The examiner stalks over to me, looks at my paper and gives a soft ""oh."" I give her a shrug, asking what I'm meant to do here. She looks me directly in the eyes and says:

""Isn't it obvious? I don't think I'm allowed to help with this one."" 

Everyone knows that's the worst thing someone can tell you while you write an exam. She meanders over to the front once more,  and I'm left with a sinking feeling in my gut. Was this some sort of social experiment we studied in class? I missed like two days total. Is my luck really that bad? Sighing, accepting my 25% chance, I circle my name. The only thing you can do in this situation is bet on yourself, really.
 Question nine, I remember. Explain Martin Seligman's learned helplessness experiment and how mental illnesses may be affected by the phenomena. Every would-be psychologist should easily know this question and I'll admit, I was a bit cocky at this point, scribbling down a long-winded explanation about everything I could muster from my head. 
Last question. Printer error, just my luck. I raise my hand, and nearly shout as I hear a bang on my desk. The examiner's face is right in front of me. There's no way she moved that quickly. Did she know the printing error? She opens her mouth.

""Can you see it? Don't blink.""

I open my mouth to question what the hell she means, but I'm not there. I'm in Saskatchewan. My mother laughs as I jump up and down in my walker, the plastic parts making noise. I'm laughing along with her, for she's everything to me. My father's sipping coffee in the corner, reading a book my mother got him for his birthday for the third time in a row.

 A flash. My mother's digital camera. It's my first day of pre-school, standing outside the classroom. She's crying, and I don't know why. She doesn't cry, only I cry. Is it really that sad I'm headed off? I enter the classroom, and I come home crying. I missed her. 

A metallic ring. Youth baseball. My dad's the coach, and he's hopping up and down in the dugout. Peter, a friend of mine from school, runs and makes it to second base. My turn up to bat. I miss every single underhand toss the other coach on our team throws to me. Shame courses through me as I see my dad bring out the batting tee, but he has a small smile on his face. Cheers as I hit it hard and make it to first, and groans as I attempt towards second and get tagged out. We get ice-cream after, and I forget all what I was upset about.

 Crackling of the fireplace channel. I'm gunning for a Wii, something everyone I know has. It's no longer a want, it's a need. I open the large present on my lap, and I'm trying to hide my disappointment. It's more Lego. I like it, but it's not exactly what I was hoping for. My mother's putting everything away, but my dad strides into the room with a big grin. One more present, and I shriek in delight. I plug the game console into our TV and I'm bouncing off the walls as I load in a disk. My parents are speaking loudly in our kitchen/dining area, but I'm too focused. I look over, and they flash awkward smiles at me and go to their room to talk. I play until 1 am, and I feel gross.

Keys Clacking, echoing. My piano recital. I'm nervous, dressed to impress and clutching the sheet music in my hand. My piano teacher calls my name and I climb up to the makeshift stage set in our school's lunchroom. I'm shaking a little bit. My parents have their cameras out, but I can't look at them. I play a simple version of F√ºr Elise, but I can't focus on the notes. I'm too worried of what happens if I mess this up. It's bound to happen. I hit the wrong sharp key, and I cringe as it reverberates through the lunchroom. My piano teacher gives me a reassuring nod, and I finish the song, before scrambling back. My parents coo over me, but I think about that wrong sharp for a week afterwards.

Laughter. high-pitched and sharp. I pull myself out of the mud that I was shoved into. The pastor's kid was always a jerk during youth groups, and I hated him, the second time I ever wished for someone to disappear. Someone pulls me out, our youth leader. ""be careful, it's slippery!"" I wish you could see what I saw, Julian. would you treat him the same you treat me after that? 

An excited squeal. Someone invited me to the dance happening, and I accepted without a thought. It's not a great dance, but I have fun. Green Day comes on, and I'm pulled out to the floor. I don't know how to dance, I realize. I voice this and there's a laugh, I'm shown the steps of a simple waltz. I can barely talk after an hour of laughter and stepping on each other's toes. Is this love? 

My classmate's voice, a valedictorian speech. I worked hard to be here, and my grades aren't stellar, but they're acceptable. I win a creative writing award, the only one I win tonight. I shake the donor's hand, and I can see my mother in the crowd, my father just running in as I smile to her. Camera flash, and they announce the title of the short story I wrote out loud. I always hated hearing what I wrote from someone else. I don't mind it tonight.

Crying. I haven't cried in years. I don't know what to do, Nothing coming out of my mouth. How do I handle this? We're parting ways, but it's to be expected. Life gets in the way, but it'll find a way. I'm sure of it. 

A soft thud. I throw the papers to the ground, red marks all over them. Red marks all over me. I'm frustrated, scrubbing everything off of myself in the shower. Why am I so stupid? I wasn't made for this place. I should've followed Paige out, gotten a blue-collar job that pays well. I can't restart now, I'm in too deep. They're counting on me, expecting me to suprass them. Deep breaths. It's fine.

A plane engine roars in my ear. I made a drastic decision, and they're worried about me. Why am I moving a thousand kilometers away? for a change of pace? You can't run from this. 

It extends beyond what I thought I already knew.

A soft glance. An attempt to get intimate, but I can't. I can't I can't I can't, and there's crying, and I can't think. I can't think. I only know to hold onto the hands in front of me, but it's not what's wanted. Is it? I feel lips on mine, but they're salty. nothing like I knew.

Shock on display. I'm shaking, Like nothing before. Please. Please say yes. There's tears from both of us, and a nod. I'm the happiest I've ever been. I know we didn't really care about the title, about the display, but I'd be lying once more if I said it wasn't the happiest I've ever been. 

Shaking hands. I stare in shock as my roommate reads over my shoulder, giving it a squeeze as eyes read the dreaded line. I've been reading it over and over and over and over. A reassurance, saying that I don't need it, I can apply again, that I have my whole life ahead of me. I know that, and yet. It was stupid of me to think I could've made it. Something wrong with me.

We smile at each other, an announcement. We've adopted. Friends crowd around us, questions and congratulations surge through the mass. I'm laughing, this secret kept for over a year. We wanted to wait until the paperwork was finished. 

Everything my mother saw, I see. I watch my son's, my daughter's life go by. It feels too quick, and I can't get enough of it. I'm everything I want to be, even if it isn't what I wanted ten, twenty years ago. I can't stop crying, years of joy, tears of grief, tears of relief. I finally see it all. I should call her. One, two, three rings. Did I take this for granted?

I lay down, resting my head on the scratchy pillow. I'm glad. I wish I could've gone first, but they've always been a little selfish, and I love them for it. My child is crying, something I've seen only for others. never for me. I hate pity, and yet I'm only at peace now. I get to hold my granddaughter's hand, a light squeeze. I wish I could've seen another one grow up, another life that I could've loved. I get it now. I can't remember well, but I know to See instead of Look, to Listen instead of Hear. How important it is to reach out and take hold of everything you love. I'll miss you, I wish to say, and yet I'm gone. I'm standing outside of Art 110. The examiner's gone, the classroom empty. Would I thank her or hate her for bringing me everything I am to my attention? I'll never understand anything the same way again.

Today, I got my exam back, and it says I got a 53%. It's still a pass, but I'm a little disappointed in it due to the exam itself. Is there someone I can talk to about this? I don't know if it'd fall to the professor or not, and I don't really want to take PSYO 111 again for a better grade. Would love to hear if anyone had the same experience, as it feels unfair that I was singled out. Thanks!

""Oh my god, you're breaking up with me. Mark. Is it - is it Mark? Are you sleeping with Mark again? '**Cause are- are you one of those fake lesbians? Just having a vacation in lesbian land and-""**

Before Callie interjects to say it isn't a bad thing that she's about to talk about, but rather how she wants to have a baby at some point.

I just find it ironic that Erica's comment gets mentioned a lot but Arizona said more or less the same thing in different words - and it's even worse, imo, bc they've been dating for some time now since late season 5, whereas Erica and Callie had gone out for what, a month at best?

There's also another point in the Season 6, ep  23 post-break up (in which they part because Callie wants kids and Arizona doesn't), where Callie says ""When are you gonna forgive me for not being a good enough lesbian for you?"" and Arizona says, ""When you do something to convince me you're falling in love with me and not being in love. When you do something to convince me that I'm different. than George O'Malley, Erica Hahn, Mark Sloan, or the girl at the coffee cart. You have a huge heart and I love that about you, but **I don't trust you. Why would I?""** Again, this is another flavour of biphobia - where bisexuals are seen as untrustworthy for being into multiple genders of people for partners.

This is as far as I've gotten in my rewatch pre-Callie saying bisexual, but it's just ironic that Erica catches flack for what she said during an argument / break up, but Arizona seems to get a pass for saying the same thing.",26,1734574170.0,greysanatomy,27,0.91,False

I stayed late after class to go over a project with my professor, Mr. Harris. He‚Äôs in his late 40s, sharp and confident, the kind of person who could hold the room‚Äôs attention without even trying. He wasn‚Äôt just another professor, there was something about him that felt... magnetic. By the time we wrapped up, the rain was coming down hard, and the campus was practically empty. I didn‚Äôt have an umbrella, so I was trying to figure out how to make the mad dash back to my dorm. That‚Äôs when he offered me a ride. I hesitated at first I mean, it‚Äôs not every day your professor offers you a lift but it was pouring, and he seemed sincere, so I said yes. His car was warm, and the conversation flowed easily. We didn‚Äôt just talk about school he asked about my plans after graduation, my favorite books, even what I loved to cook. It felt like he actually saw me as more than just a student. Then, instead of heading straight to my dorm, he suggested stopping for coffee to wait out the storm. I didn‚Äôt think much of it it felt casual, harmless. But sitting across from him in that quiet little caf√©, it was hard to ignore how natural everything felt. He shared stories about his life, his travels, and the random things that made him laugh. I found myself opening up in a way I hadn‚Äôt expected. At one point, he looked at me and said, ‚ÄúYou have this energy about u like you know exactly who you are and where you‚Äôre going.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt flirty, exactly, but it caught me off guard. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to say, so I just smiled, probably too much. When he dropped me off, the air felt heavier, like we both knew something had shifted but neither of us would say it. Nothing happened there was no kiss, no lingering touch, but I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about him afterward. It‚Äôs weird, isn‚Äôt it? Because he‚Äôs my professor, and yet he treated me like someone worth knowing outside the classroom, like more than just another face in his lectures. That feeling stayed with me long after.

TL;DR¬† One of the best trips and properties I have ever experienced on every level.¬† There is often mention on here of resorts or properties that are worth a trip unto themselves.¬† Tswalu is one of those magical places.¬† It takes a lot to impress me‚Äîjust trust me and go.¬† Currently there is a ‚Äòbook 6 nights pay 5‚Äô promo that includes flights. ¬†

A little about me: ¬†  I am Africa obsessed and go at least once a year.¬† Having just returned from a three week trip in South Africa and Mozambique with my incredible executive assistant (who is born and bred in Durban SA)¬† I thought I would drop some trip reviews over the next weeks as there are always a lot of Africa questions on here. ¬†

**Location**

Nestled in the southern most edge of the Kalahari Desert in the Northern Cape of South Africa and a short semi private hour and half flight from Johannesburg ‚Äîlies Tswalu.

This reserve is 282,00 acres‚Äî making it South Africas largest privately owned game reserve.

There are three camps in Tswalu- Loapi Tented Camp, The Motse Camp and Tarkuni Homestead.¬†

For this particular trip we decided on The Motse.

Motse has 9 suites and accommodates 18 guests- 6 of the suites are for two guests and then there are three suites which accommodate families of 4. So two bedrooms linked by a living room.

The lodge is absolutely stunning, a perfect retreat for those seeking solace in nature without compromising on comfort.¬†

There is a watering hole situated in-front of the main guest area which being in the desert attracts a lot of wildlife. From antelope to birds to wild dogs, on our very first morning there was a flurry of activity at the watering hole as the wild dogs decided to pay us a visit and hung around for a good few hours.¬†



**Suites**

https://preview.redd.it/qxja43v4op7e1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1541ec8565bc49e3a1b39d0ce164873b280aae65

The suites are luxurious and natural. The organic materials and nature-inspired tones complement and provide sanctuary from the rugged beauty of the desert. The rooms are spacious and elegantly appointed- each suite has ensuite bathrooms with indoor and outdoor showers and freestanding bathtubs. There is a sitting area with a fire place (bush TV!), a study and a private veranda with a large day bed allowing you to be immersed in the sights and sounds of the African bush from the comfort of your private haven.¬†

Most days we ate lunch on our veranda with our favorite bottle of South African Sauvignon Blanc (Iona) which they had well stocked for us ahead of time. The suite is also equipped with a stunning cupboard which opens up into the minibar which is fully stocked with all of your favorite things. The attention to detail in our room was truly exceptional- there was a map of Tswalu on the roof of our canopy bed.. I mean!!!!!! It is the perfect blend of luxury and authenticity.



**Amenities + Entertainment**

The camp‚Äôs communal area has a generous amount of space for relaxing and perusing:¬† swimming in one of the two pools, a fire pit, a library, a wine cellar, the boma , a shop, a photography workshop and a spa and gym. But of course our adventures extended far beyond the confines of the lodge. The highlight of the trip was undoubtedly our encounter with a pack of 15 wild dogs whilst on the hunt. At Tswalu you can tailor make your day because you are guaranteed your own vehicle with your own¬† tracker and guide.¬†

Unlike other reserves there are no other camps or safari vehicles here therefore you have unlimited time at sightings and don‚Äôt have to share with anyone else.¬† This also means you can go out into the bush at any time of the day or you can spend the entire day out if thats what you'd prefer.

One unique activity to Tswalu is the horseback riding experience. For adventure enthusiasts like us, the opportunity to explore the Kalahari on horseback was a dream come true. We combined this experience with the Malori- which is a luxury tented sleep out in the bush. We had a private chef and were served dinner under a star studded-sky. This entire experience was honestly the epitome of magic. ¬† We woke up the next day to an incredible breakfast and then began our walk with the meerkats‚Ä¶. it doesn‚Äôt get better than this.¬†

These are just some of our experiences at Tswalu ‚Äîbut they truly do offer so much more.¬† You can hang out with the researchers to see the pangolins or get involved with some of their conservation projects.¬† The options are endless.¬† Tswalu is one of the best places to see the ‚Äòelusive five'- Brown hyena, aardvark aardwolf, bat-eared fox and ground pangolin. What can't you do at Tswalu? You quite simply are just going to have to go to find out!

Tswalu is extremely child friendly with no age requirements (as in you can even put in a carseat on the game drive vehicle) .¬† Malaria is not present making it a perfect spot for the whole family. Children 12 and under are free.



**Dining**

The food at the lodge was fresh and nothing short of outstanding, the menu changed for lunch and dinner everyday.¬† I was relieved they didn‚Äôt change the breakfast menu as I have found my new favorite breakfast- poached egg with spinach, friend chickpeas and chickpea falafel! YUM- it‚Äôs a must!¬†

Every meal is an absolute treat and not at all too much, the perfect portions and there are options for you to splurge or be as healthy as you like!

Speaking of dining, no words can do justice to the culinary marvels crafted at the restaurant Klein Jan. With the chef‚Äôs Michelin-starred pedigree, every meal was a gastronomic journey; a symphony of flavors that danced on our palates. Each dish was a masterpiece, lovingly prepared using the freshest ingredients sourced from Tswalu's own organic gardens.

The restaurant itself‚Äî is as they say‚Äî a culinary safari.¬† It‚Äôs interactive as you move, quite literally from one part of the restaurant to another as you move from course to course. Starting in a farmhouse built in 1918 to ending your safari at the bottom of a converted water silo there are surprises course after course!

**Service**

Amidst these adventures, the impeccable service at Tswalu never faltered. The staff anticipated our every need with warmth and professionalism, ensuring that our stay was as seamless as it was luxurious.

Our guide and tracker were some of my favorite people I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of meeting, they knew what all our favorite drinks and snacks were, knew all the activities that we wanted to do during our stay and had come up with an itinerary so that we could fit everything in. They were honestly unbelievable and having been on safari quite a lot I can say, I‚Äôve never had a tracker and guide take such precious care of the memories we wanted to make or really take the time to devise a way we could make the absolute most out of our stay. ¬†

1hhhw4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hhhw4o/has_anyone_here_taken_the_supplement_zygentra/,"Has anyone here taken the supplement ""Zygentra Ultimate"" and know how to reverse the effects? Alternatively, what's a good way to kill thousands of silverfish at a time without hurting yourself?","I‚Äôve made a few mistakes in my life. Hell, maybe more than a few. Somewhere between a handful and a fuck-ton is probably a good estimation. I think the issue is I put my trust in the wrong places, but I‚Äôm just trying to navigate the world as best I can - same as everyone else. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm gullible, but I like the word ‚Äú*suggestible‚Äù*. Let me put it this way: my beliefs and convictions can be like loose flower petals on a blustery day - they drift in whatever way the wind pushes them. One moment I‚Äôm floating east, the wind changes direction, and now I‚Äôm floating west. One day, I‚Äôll believe in climate change, then I listen to a certain popular podcast, and now I think it‚Äôs a hoax. I know that it‚Äôs pathetic. If I can just make it through this year, I swear I‚Äôll change, but my savings are depleted, and the pills are running out. I can hear them all skittering and slamming all around me, just out of sight, biding their time until the effects of the medication to wear off.

This all began a few weeks back. My life was unremarkable then, but at least it was normal. I had a cushy job at a local tech company, the same one I‚Äôve had for the last five years. Reasonable hours, good benefits plan, 6 weeks of paid time off - I lived comfortably but noticeably alone. No wife, no girlfriend. I wasn‚Äôt born with a lot of charm. I was never very proficient at initiating pleasantries, and even if I did manage to start a conversation with a lady, I couldn‚Äôt find the words to maintain it. Of course, that would all be one thing if I was some hulking adonis, smooth and chiseled and all that - maybe then I could have compensated for my lack of a silver tongue. But I could never grow any muscle despite my efforts. I bought and tried a lot of different supplements that were supposed to help stimulate growth. Powders with names like ‚ÄúMuscle Matrix‚Äù and ‚ÄúCrazy Muscle‚Äù. They never did a damn thing, even put me in the hospital one time for kidney damage.

Retrospectively, I should have also been working out while on those supplements. I wanted to wait until the supplements started having an effect before I began really working out.

Terrible cystic acne was the icing on top. Red, painful craters had littered my face since I turned 16. Tried everything for that too - bee venom, reiki, power juicing. None of the online recommendations produced the desired effect. And it all gave me the impression that I was utterly unworthy compared to other guys my age. I could feel myself giving up on a life that was more fulfilling than the one I already had, and on companionship. Then, I saw the ad pop on my Facebook page. It promised to fix me, and I fell for it. Hook, line, and sinker.¬†

It read something like this:

*Do you have trouble attracting women? Unable to catch a vixen‚Äôs eye from all the way at the other end of the bar? Does your mere presence in a room inspire overwhelming, knee-buckling repulsion from any potential mates? Before the modern age, there were no solutions. Lonely devils would go to their doctors, looking for salvation, only instead to be told there was nothing else to be done - Western Medicine cursing them to die alone. But we don‚Äôt live in the past, do we, dear friends? With major advancements in natural attraction technology, L. Bartleby, Ph.D., is proud to announce: Zygentra Ultimate, the miracle medication for the misbegotten common man. With Zygentra Ultimate, even the lowliest bachelor has hope for a happy ending. One pill is all it takes to change everything about you.*¬†

In big, confident words, the bottom said:

*One payment, one pill - one solution to the problem of you.*

Even though the advertisement omitted what it would improve about me, I was intrigued. The ad had all the buzz words - ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù, ‚Äútechnology‚Äù, ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù. Their distrust of Western Medicine hit close to home, too. As far as I was concerned, doctors were pill pushers controlled by pharmaceutical companies that pulled their marionette strings from the shadows. I mean, what was in the pills they recommended, anyway? And for that matter, why can‚Äôt I pronounce half the compounds that make up vaccines? Thiomersal, Polysorbate 80 - I mean formaldehyde, for Christ‚Äôs sake. It all felt so artificial and unsafe. But this advertisement seemed to promote something more ‚Äúof the earth‚Äù and ‚Äúorganic‚Äù, the so-called ‚Äúnatural attraction technology‚Äù. Tired of being lonely and unworthy, I emailed the company.¬†

Like I said, hook, line, and sinker. Biggest mistake of my life.

In my message to the company, I tried to perform my due diligence in vetting the supplement. What was in it? How much was the supplement? Would it interact with the Chinese muscle-enhancing herbs I ordered the week before?¬†

This was their response, copy-pasted from my Gmail:

*Greetings Zach,*

*Thank you for your interest in Zygentra Ultimate. One pill, one payment, one solution to the problem of you.*¬†

*To clarify, Zygentra is a medication, not a supplement - though no matter what you call it, it is a miracle. Through a proprietary mechanism of action that utilizes the wonders of CRISPR technology, Zygentra enables the human body to naturally self-regulate the hormonal disequilibriums that are to blame for a variety of male inequities: it can resolve poor muscle growth, weak libidos, erectile dysfunction, and a bevy of disfiguring skin conditions including but not limited to: seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, lichen planus simplex, and cystic acne.*¬†

*Unfortunately, the future is not always affordable, and it is rarely covered by insurance. Thankfully, this onetime cost can last upwards of a year, if not much longer. Zygentra teaches your body to produce life-changing pheromones that are genetically transplanted from the naturally occurring Lepisma saccharium species. In short, one pill is all you need.*¬†

*Zygentra Ultimate can solve the problem of you with a onetime payment of 30,000 US dollars. We do not accept payment plans. Also, for obvious reasons, we recommend all of our clients relocate prior to taking their dose; Antarctica is preferable, but Northern Canada is a reasonable alternative.*¬†

*Please let us know if you are planning to pursue a happy ending. If so, we can help set up a wire transfer.*¬†

*Amy,*

*Senior Sales Associate and Miracleworker at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals*¬†

I had to pick my jaw off the floor after I finished quickly scanning the email, skipping the scientific mumbo-jumbo to find the price point. They seriously wanted me to pay 30,000 dollars, one lump sum, for this supplement. Not that I couldn‚Äôt afford the payment - I could, but barely, using a nest egg my mom left for me after she passed. It was just an obscene amount of money. But it was alluring - one pill that would fix my body, or I guess teach it to fix itself, naturally? Was that even possible? When I thought about it more, the exorbitant fee made it feel more legitimate, like I was paying for cutting-edge technology that actually could work. Wouldn‚Äôt the Better Business Bureau prevent a company from selling a product for much more than it was worth? Wasn‚Äôt that illegal?¬†

To speed things up, I‚Äôll skip the part where I contemplated my options, did a lot of online research, and signed a waiver that Amy mailed to me. Two weeks later, the singular pill arrived in an icebox as an overnight shipment from the Delfoy Pharmaceuticals headquarters. Amy told me they needed to keep it cold.¬†

It wasn‚Äôt like any pill I had taken before. The supplement more resembled an extra-large piece of caviar - gelatinous and orb-shaped. The box had no instructions, so I shrugged my shoulders and ingested it, using a swig of the nearest open Mountain Dew to wash it down.

I was ready not to be alone anymore.¬†

No big change the first few days. Maybe I really was a sap, I thought. But one morning, while looking in the mirror, I noticed it - my skin was clearing up like it never had before. More than that, I felt virile and confident, out of the blue. My muscles even looked more toned. It was a state of being entirely new to me, and at first, it was incredible. For the first time, I felt deserving of love and happiness. Riding that sensation for all it was worth, I asked Stacy, an attractive coworker, on a dinner date. I had fantasized about asking her out for what seemed like my entire life. She said yes. The ecstasy I experienced after that moment was unparalleled. It was like some heavy, invisible weights had been taken off my shoulders. We planned a dinner date at a local Italian place later that week. With the supplement coursing through my veins, I felt unstoppable and was pleasantly surprised by the lack of side effects. I had experienced some new floaters in my peripheral vision and mild armpit pain, but that was it.

At first, the date was everything I could have hoped for. Stacy always had an aura of kindness about her - she was angelic, honestly. It‚Äôs what drew me towards her. Even though I secured the date, I was still nervous about my ability to keep up a conversation through the meal. To my surprise, it wasn‚Äôt difficult. Because I was different, improved by the supplement, I guess I just wasn‚Äôt as fearful of rejection anymore. I was stunned to discover Stacy had been secretly planning to ask me out too.

*‚ÄúOver the last week? Since I started my new skin regimen, I mean.‚Äù* I said, choking on the last few words because I was never very good at lying. I didn‚Äôt want to scare Stacy off by volunteering the information that I had recently purged my bank accounts to pay for Zygentra.¬†

She giggled, a cute and tiny laugh that made my heart swell with affection.

*‚ÄúNo, nothing to do with whatever new moisturizer you invested in. And a lot longer than just this week. For at least a year, I think. I always found you handsome, and you were always polite to me and everyone else in the office - a good sign of character. You were just quiet and reserved. I couldn‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôd say yes if I asked, so I never did. A bit childish and cowardly, I know, but sometimes I just feel small and out of place in the world, if that makes any sense,‚Äù* remarked Stacy, eyes diverting from mine while she made this confession. ¬†

Her words felt familiar - or maybe not her words; it was the way she put the words together. The underlying self-deprecation, I mean. She had some venomous monologue playing on a loop in her head, just like I did. Broke my heart at first, and I wasn‚Äôt sure how to respond. But I noticed at that moment that I felt a little less lonely for the first time in my adult life. I smiled, met her eyes, and came up with the most ornate, reverent statement I could to comfort her and let her know I understood.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an absolute vision, Stacy. Like, you‚Äôre radiant. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs hard for you to see it sometimes, but I really get that pain.‚Äù*

Her expression changed, now warm and relaxed, and I could tell I actually managed to console her. I got lost in that moment then, in the beautiful comfort of it. Even as I type it up, I find myself getting lost in the memory of it. But something hoicked me out of the moment then, and it‚Äôs the same thing that‚Äôs pulling me out of its memory now: terrible, skittering things on the outskirts of my vision.¬†

In the restaurant, I was experiencing worsening floaters in my periphery, but I was too transfixed on Stacy to notice something was off - that maybe they weren‚Äôt just floaters. As our dessert arrived, I felt something vibrating in the sole of my dress shoe. It really gave me a start, and I reflexively stomped my right foot onto the floor, surprising Stacy in turn. I took off my shoe to examine its contents, only to find the crushed body of a silverfish. Its greyish carapace was split into three asymmetric pieces from the force of my stomp. Each piece was still wriggling a little bit, and I felt nausea rise in my stomach.¬†

It was bigger than any silverfish I‚Äôd ever seen before, too. In my experience, they never grew larger than an inch. This silverfish was *easily* 5 inches long, if not more. I could count at least 20 other, equally large silverfish crawling around in a wobbly circle, with me as the center. Before I killed the insect in my shoe, the other dinner goers had noticed the bugs and were flagging down restaurant staff to complain. At first, I was with them - what kind of restaurant serves food with this type of infestation? It took the tickling, wriggling feeling of something crawling up my left pant leg to cause me to re-evaluate the situation.¬†

Wildly, I made a circle with my thumb and index finger and tightened it around my knee, pushing down the length of my calf in an attempt to expel what I knew were more silverfish before they found their way higher into my pants. When my palm first connected with my knee, I felt a sickening crunch under the tip of my index finger. The maneuver pushed out three silverfish - one headless from being caught in the crossfire of my hand meeting my knee. When I looked up, the restaurant was in a state of pandemonium. At that point, there were definitely over 20, maybe 100 or 200, silverfish radiating in a circle around me. It finally registered - whatever was happening, I was the cause, and I hadn‚Äôt been experiencing floaters before - I was seeing silverfish skittering around in my peripheral vision.¬†

I shot up from my chair, frightening Stacy again, accompanied by the sensation of another crunch in the shoe I hadn‚Äôt yet taken off. I said something to my date, couldn‚Äôt tell you what, and I excused myself from the table while moving towards the door. Outside in the parking lot, I began sprinting to my car with only one shoe on; but then I remembered I had driven Stacy here. I briefly turned around to get her, but I could see gleaming silver little bullets racing to catch up to me on the asphalt, lit up by the sparkle of parking lot lights. I U-turned and sprinted even faster to my car, got in, and just started driving. After 15 minutes, I pulled over and urgently emailed Delfoy Pharmaceuticals from my phone. I wanted to know how to reverse the effects of Zygentra Ultimate.

Not long after I parked, I saw silverfish on the front windshield, leaking into the car through whatever cracks they could find. I floored it, but it was in a park, so I went nowhere. For the third time that night, I again felt the snap of their brittle bodies against my foot, having just crushed another two silverfish. A moment later, I felt one making its way up my left earlobe. I whipped my head to the right so hard that my neck would later be painfully sore, but the force launched a silverfish off my ear to somewhere in the back of my sedan. Putting the car in drive, I exploded down the country road I had parked on. I kept driving, killing silverfish as I went, till I heard an inbox notification come from my iphone, which was about two hours after I had sent the email:

*Hello Zach,*

*I am sorry to hear you are disappointed with our product. Unfortunately, there is no reversal agent for Zygentra Ultimate. I thought I made this very clear in our introductory email, and you did sign a release saying you understood the risk-benefit profile of the medication.*¬†

*To re-explain, Zygentra Ultimate utilizes CRISPR technology to give the human body the ability to produce pheromones from Lepisma saccharium, the most common species of silverfish in America. Laboratory studies have shown that these pheromones can help with male sexual dysfunction and certain skin conditions due to an anti-inflammatory effect. As you must know, pheromones are designed to attract members of the opposite sex of the species producing them. It is basically a big sign around an animal‚Äôs neck saying: ‚ÄúI am ready to mate‚Äù. Therefore, we recommend relocation to Northern Canada or Antarctica in conjunction with Zygentra Ultimate - these are some of the few areas in the world that Lepisma saccharium does not naturally inhabit.*¬†

*The medication is not reversible, however, because CRISPR is gene-editing technology - the reason your body ‚Äúlearns‚Äù to create the foreign hormones is because Zygentra Ultimate inserts the pheromone-producing silverfish DNA into your genetic code. How else would one pill cause an effect lasting a year or more? Additionally, the armpit pain you are experiencing is most likely the rapid growth of modified glandular tissue responsible for producing the silverfish pheromones.*¬†

*I still recommend considering physical relocation. I hear the Yukon is wonderful this time of year! The alternate solution would be to invest in Zygentra Plus, which can help mitigate some of the silverfish-attracting side effects of Zygentra Ultimate. We recognize that this is an emergency situation, and Defloy Pharmaceuticals is always willing to help where we can! We have shipped a 48-hour trial supply of Zygentra Plus to your home, for free.*¬†

*Please consider your options and get back to us. If you would like to purchase additional Zygentra Plus, a week‚Äôs supply costs $750, with a 5 percent discount if you purchase the medication in bulk.*

*Amy,*

*Senior Sales Associate and Miracleworker at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals*¬†

When I received this email, I had a grand total of 3,500 dollars to my name. Desperation hit me like an avalanche. A little under 4 grand was nowhere near the funds I would need to move from Miami to Northern Canada. Moving would also force me to quit my job, and I didn‚Äôt want to leave Stacy behind. Retrospectively, I should have just used that money to move myself and my shitty car as far north as it would take me.¬†

When Zygentra Plus arrived five days later, I was beyond sleep-deprived. I had called out of work that week, as I certainly couldn‚Äôt come in and work on code as the fucking pied piper of silverfish. I spent that time driving around, stopping only when I felt myself drifting into sleep at the wheel. Pulled over to wherever I could and close my eyes, but before long, the sensation of silverfish crawling into my mouth or between my armpits would wake me up with a start, like I had jabbed myself with an adrenaline shot - at which point I would resume driving. No amount of insect repellant spray or mouse traps seemed to prevent the legion from getting to me.¬†

I hastily unpackaged the box containing the pro bono Zygentra Plus. The instructions on the supplement were: *take four pills by mouth every two hours*. Every *two fucking hours*. It did work at keeping the bugs away, but only if I religiously took the medication as instructed, which only served to minimally improve my sleep deprivation. I needed to return to work, but that ended up being a mistake, too. I had ditched Stacy on our first date without explanation and then proceeded not to talk to her for a week while I was driving around in circles, waiting for the Zygentra Plus to arrive. When she saw me again at work, I had dark circles around my bloodshot eyes the size of trash bags, and I nervously scanned my surroundings for silverfish. She said hello to me, and I don‚Äôt think I said hello back. Instead, I opted to launch into a minute-by-minute retelling of my last week. What I told her was an incoherent mess. Stacy nodded along politely to my tale, but I could see fear and concern rising in her eyes. Eventually, I gave her mercy, excused myself in the middle of a sentence, and pitifully returned to my desk. I dragged my body through about half of a workday before the side effects of Zygentra Plus started.

Out of nowhere, I felt my mouth fill uncomfortably with saliva. When I tried to sip my morning coffee, dribble would involuntarily spill out of my mouth, down my chin and onto my shirt collar. Before long, I had a half-crescent of soaked fabric around my neck despite my efforts to keep my mouth closed. Next, my eyes began watering uncontrollably, making it look like I was quietly sobbing all morning. The final straw was when I took my hand off my coffee cup, only to have a thin layer of palm skin remain stuck to the grip, peeling from my hand and causing immense and immediate pain. I screamed. And then, of course, there was a lot of bleeding. In a panic, I hastily left my desk without saying a word, no doubt leaving behind plenty of tears, saliva, skin and blood. My boss caught up and confronted me about my behavior before I could leave the building. I tried to say something, but saliva just erupted from my mouth instead. I probably looked rabid.

I didn‚Äôt come back to work the next day, or the following day. A few days after that, a message on my cellphone answering machine told me I was fired.

Amy, resident miracle worker at Defloy Pharmaceuticals, wasn‚Äôt much help with the situation. I let her know that, although Zygentra Plus was helping keep the insects away, the side effects from it weren‚Äôt much more bearable. The excess saliva and tears were one thing, but pieces of my skin were sloughing off with the slightest manipulation, like I was some human danish. And I still wasn‚Äôt sleeping - I needed to set multiple alarms to get myself up every two hours to take the new medication; otherwise, the silverfish would be back. She explained to me that this was expected, as Zygentra Plus acted as a low-dose insecticide I was digesting and releasing into the surrounding air from my pores or what was left of them. At the brink of insanity, I demanded to speak with ‚ÄúMr. Bartleby‚Äù, the supposed genius creator and mind behind the Zygentra line of products mentioned in the original advertisement. I thought maybe he would have an elegant solution to all of this. In response, Amy said, and I quote:

*‚ÄúWell, that will be impossible. Mr. Bartleby is more of an idea than a person. Here at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals, we all aspire to achieve the goals that Dr. Bartleby represents. Also, it seems to help with sales.‚Äù*

But don‚Äôt worry, she said, there was still something to be done - Amy theorized that drastically increasing my zinc levels might mitigate some symptoms from Zygentra Plus. I spent my last 500 dollars on that supplement, unsure of what I would do next, even if it helped. But I needed relief. Moreover, I needed to keep taking the pills because I was terrified of what would happen to me when I ran out, and the silverfish came back. My car was out of gas, my skin was breaking down, I was jobless and nearly out of money. If they returned, I would have limited defenses and nowhere to hide.¬†I‚Äôm not particularly eager to think about what would happen to me.

The zinc supplement was a purple-reddish liquid that I was instructed to drink once a day. I voraciously gulped it down, immediately experiencing excruciating pain from my lips to deep in my chest. I would come to learn that the compound I drank, Zinc Hydrosulfide, is a very strong acid. I stared at the words ‚Äústrong acid‚Äù in the email, dumbfounded, with blood and saliva dripping from my scalded mouth onto the screen. Amy then offered a subdermal injection to help me tolerate the Zinc Hydrosulfide, and I just started laughing. Must have been laughing for a while, because when my laughing slowed down, I saw silver floaters in my periphery again, meaning I was due for my next dose of Zygentra Plus.

I could barely swallow the pills after what the liquid had done to my mouth and esophagus, almost passing out from the pain. Even if I had the money to pay for the 2,000-dollar subdermal injection, which I do not, I have no idea where I would even inject it into. Didn‚Äôt have much of a ‚Äúdermis‚Äù left after the effects of Zygentra Plus, which had liberated me from a good portion of my skin.

Effectively, I am now stuck. The acidic liquid that was supposed to help with the side effects from the pills has now prevented me from taking *any* pills, or at least has made it a great deal harder and more painful. The medication that would help me tolerate the acidic liquid was no good either - the pills had dissolved the skin that it was supposed to be injected under. Perhaps most critically of all, I am now broke.

Thought about going to the hospital - some combination of fear and shame prevented me from doing that. Calling an ambulance may be my next move, but I‚Äôm not sure they can do anything for me now. The silverfish will find me no matter where I am. I‚Äôm sure there are plenty lurking unseen in the cracks and crevices of the hospital.

Plus, who knows if the medications they‚Äôd give me would interact with the supplements.

So, with about 12 hours of my oral insecticide left, I have decided to throw a bit of a Hail Mary. Has anyone else taken Zygentra Ultimate before and knows how to reverse it? 

Alternatively, anyone have a good way to kill thousands of silverfish at a time without hurting [yourself?](https://linktr.ee/unalloyedsainttrina)",7,1734573117.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Just had my second medial nerve branch block in the last 6 weeks - same doctor, same meds, same largely postive experience.

This time though I am feeling the side effects of the propfol way more. I had a headache before I even went under yesterday which we chalked up to the fasting before the procedure in particularly not having my morning coffee, I still had it when I woke up which is how I learned it actually propofol doesn't provide any pain relief, just sleep!

I've at the headache on and off since then, when I first take a pain reliever it helps but wears off in a few hours. Its been an ""ice pick"" headache mostly. Some dizziness which was worst this morning but even after dinner I had a moment being off kilter.

Procedure ended 11:30am Tues, it's now 8:45pm Wed.

The surgical center give me a follow-up call today and I spoke with them about it, they said that it was likely just the combination of working out the anesthesia and my body just still feeling a bit off from the change of routine yesterday. Advise me to keep drinking a lot of fluids which my goodness I have been doing! And they said that the headache wasn't a huge concern because I've had the procedure on my back, not my neck.

Has anyone felt like this 36 hrs after anesthesia and if so what helped to get over it? Just time? If I wake up with it tomorrow I'll call over to the doctor, it's been a rough day juggling work and kids like this.",1,1734572944.0,backpain,3,1.0,False

1hhht35,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1hhht35/ysl_black_opium_glitter_review/,YSL Black Opium Glitter Review,"So I went in to Ulta this afternoon to see if I could get my hands on a tester of the new Black Opium Glitter. My Ulta didn‚Äôt have the full bottles out yet but they had the travel spray so I was able to smell it on a tester strip and test it out on my skin. 

Background on me: My favorite scents at the moment are woodsy vanillas and gourmands. I steer clear of anything extremely floral or heavy patchouli/oud. I do like the original Black Opium but my favorite is the Black Opium Le Parfum.

Review: I was so wildly disappointed by Black Opium Glitter. Based on other reviews I read here I expected it to be a combination of LDBS mixed with Black Opium. On me, LDBS smells like very very sweet Froot Loops cereal milk so I was expecting something a lot sweeter and creamier than what I got from Black Opium Glitter. The fragrance opens with a burst of citrus and pear that dissipates quickly (I‚Äôm talking within 60 seconds or so). The next 2-3 hours of wear are completely dominated by the orange blossom. The orange blossom is so strong in Black Opium Glitter and I found it quite overwhelming to my nose. It‚Äôs not sweet orange blossom like LDBS - it‚Äôs much more white floral forward almost veering on screechy to me? This note overpowers any coffee and marshmallow notes I was hoping would be more prominent. By hour 4-5 this perfume smelled like a very faint OG Black Opium mixed with the slightest bit of marshmallow musk. An okay dry down but I prefer the Le Parfum version much more. This scent was gone from my skin by about 6-7 hours of wear but I was very careful to not overspray because I think I would have given myself a headache with how strong the orange blossom was. 

Overall score: 6/10. Not terrible, but not something I would spend the money on (even with the Ulta coupons circulating right now)",4,1734572855.0,FemFragLab,0,0.83,False

Not because I think he‚Äôs going to ‚Äúsave America‚Äù or because I suddenly want to cosplay as a MAGA hat-wearing flag cape guy. my reason is much simpler: I can‚Äôt wait to watch the absolute train wreck unfold and have the satisfaction of saying,¬†*‚ÄúThis is your fault, MAGA.‚Äù*  
  
Republicans have spent the past few years blaming¬†*everything*¬†on Biden. Your gas prices are high? Biden. Your rent went up? Biden. Your dog doesn‚Äôt listen to you?¬†**Biden.**¬†Stub your toe? Biden again

But after this January? Oh man.¬†*The fun begins.*¬†The economy tanks? That‚Äôs on Trump. Another Twitter beef escalates into a foreign policy disaster? Trump. Your toddler refuses to eat their veggies? Yup, still Trump. And the best part? There‚Äôs no more scapegoats. 

 I can already hear the desperate excuses rolling in:  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs doing his best!‚Äù  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the¬†*fake news*¬†spinning the narrative!‚Äù  
‚ÄúActually, this is just part of his genius 12-step plan to fix America!‚Äù

You asked for this. You voted for this. And now, you get to own every single second of it.But What I‚Äôm really looking forward to, though, is the sheer comedy of watching the MAGA crowd scramble to defend their guy when the inevitable disasters hit. It‚Äôs going to be a four-year live-action meme. The mental gymnastics, the conspiracy theories, the cope levels‚Äîit‚Äôs going to be the greatest political sitcom ever produced.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôll be over here with a front-row seat and a giant bucket of popcorn, casually pointing out,¬†*‚ÄúThis is what you wanted, right? You promised greatness. So‚Ä¶ where is it?‚Äù*¬†Watching it all unfold will be the ultimate last laugh.

This is chapter 1, so far.","As I stood there mid-walk, next to the foggy mist of mysterious Washington state, the pitter-patter of rain kept pelting down on my skin like a needle to a wound‚Äînonstop rain. The atmosphere felt cold and damp on my pale skin. My rain boots nearly wore out from feeling like the ocean all the time. But that's just Dutchstone. My dad, Tim always hated the concept of me going to the diner for a job, but I needed the money. College wasn't going to pay for itself.¬† So where are you supposed to work here in this small town where you don't get noticed very often. I reminded him that its the only spot that hires teenagers. He was understanding as ever. He was often gone up to the mountains as lumberjacks often do.¬†

Dad never let me get my license. He said it was for my safety, but I always knew the truth. He didn't want the same fate that took Mom to show up at our doorstep again. A car crash had stolen her from us, and with that came his iron grip on anything that felt remotely dangerous. So, I walked everywhere. I didn't mind it, not really. Dutchstone was small, quiet. The kind of town where every face was familiar and every street felt like home‚Äîor at least something close to it. Walking gave me time to think, time to escape in my own little bubble. It actually felt good being independent.¬†

But Dad's overprotectiveness‚Äî I mean, sure, it could be a little suffocating. But he wasn't overbearing if that makes sense. He knew my friends and I wanted to be teenagers and didn't want to be seen as the uncool dad. He picked up on these things, maybe even before I did. But I got it. We both understood what it meant to lose someone, to have the rug yanked out from under you, and I guess in his way, he was trying to keep me safe from a world that could take me away, just like it had taken Mom but¬† wanted to give me space to deal with it all.¬†

¬†So with my earbuds in and music blasting‚Äîsometimes Tek E, sometimes Lainey Atwood or maybe even Cameron Morrison's nursing podcast, depending on my mood‚ÄîI could tune out the world. The thud of my boots on the cracked pavement became my rhythm, the endless gray skies my backdrop. Rain was just part of life here. It soaked into the air, the streets, and sometimes even my skin, but it didn't bother me.

Old Continental was the kind of road that felt like it belonged in another era, like it had been forgotten by time. Its winding path was framed by towering evergreens, their branches heavy with rain and moss, creating a canopy that made it feel like I was walking through a tunnel. The pavement was cracked and uneven, with weeds poking through every crevice, and the only sounds were the soft scuff of my boots and the occasional rustle of leaves as the wind cut through the trees.

Eighteen minutes and forty-two seconds was my travel time‚Äîif I walked fast. I always timed it. Not because I was in a rush, but because it gave me a sense of control. A small, measurable goal in a life that sometimes felt like it was teetering just out of my grasp.

As I turned the first corner, the usual sight of old mailboxes and sagging fences greeted me, but something about the stillness felt... off. Dutchstone was always quiet, but this was different. The kind of silence that made your ears strain to hear something‚Äîanything.

I shook it off, adjusting my earbuds and turning up the volume. Lainey Atwood's voice filled my head, soft and steady, like an old friend whispering reassurance. But even the music couldn't completely drown out the faint prickling at the back of my neck.

It happened sometimes on Old Continental. A strange sensation, like I was being watched. I'd chalked it up to paranoia‚Äîprobably from listening to too many true crime podcasts with my friends. But tonight, the feeling was stronger, more insistent.

The diner was just ahead, its light spilling from the windows and pulling me in, offering warmth and the comfort of familiarity. When I stepped inside, the bell above the door jingled softly, and immediately, I felt the weight on my shoulders ease. The smell of frying bacon and fresh coffee wrapped around me, soothing in its simplicity.

Ruthie was behind the counter, as always, her curly hair pulled up into a messy bun. She glanced up when she heard the door open.

""Hey, you made it,"" she said, her tone light, though her eyes flicked to my soaked jacket, a hint of concern in them. ""Everything good?""

I nodded, forcing a smile. ""Yeah, just the usual. Rain's pretty relentless tonight.""

Ruthie raised an eyebrow, scanning me as if she could see right through the front I was putting up. ""You sure? You look like you've seen something.""

I let out a soft laugh, but it sounded hollow, even to me. ""Just tired. It's nothing. I'm gonna get changed into my work clothes, I'll be right back.""

She studied me for a moment longer, her gaze lingering before she shrugged. ""Alright. Just... let me know if you need anything, yeah?""¬†¬†

After Ruthie's words, the moment of concern passes, and I head for the small staff room in the back. It's a tight space, with only a few lockers, a chipped table, and an old mirror that always made me look like I hadn't gotten enough sleep. I hang my wet jacket on the back of the door and slip into my work clothes‚Äîsimple black pants, a faded apron, and a nametag that still has my first day's date scribbled on the back in pen. Tommy's back there, flipping burgers, his voice rising as he yells at his son for yet another batch of soggy fries. I can hear the playful frustration in his tone, the same as always, and it makes me smile. It's these little moments, the noise, the laughter, the chaos of the kitchen‚Äîit's all part of what makes the diner feel like home.

For all the mundanity of Dutchstone, these are the moments I cling to. The way everything seems frozen in time, just a small reprieve from the quiet, monotonous life of this little town.

As I got ready to deliver orders to the truck drivers from Oregon and all over the United States, I happened to get stuck in the freezer while reaching for a new batch of syrup. The passcode was on the outside‚Äî786024. You've got to be kidding me, I thought, banging on the door as if I was trying to escape from some horror nightmare scenario.

Billi was my closest thing to a friend at work‚Äîmy age, long red hair that she claimed was all natural, though I knew better. As she opened the door, I was so upset that I'd been trapped in there for even a minute.

""You've got to be more careful, Hannah,"" Billi said, her voice light and teasing. I smirked on the outside, but inside, I was embarrassed‚Äîembarrassed that the whole diner had witnessed me freaking out like that. None of the customers moved a muscle. They'd seen it all before, and even though they probably would've helped, none of them knew the damned passcode. That thing will be the death of me, I swear. My one frustration was that damn door. Not even Dutchstone, with its quiet, relentless routine, made me feel as trapped as that freezer door did.

Finally, my shift ended. Ruthie caught my eye from behind the counter, her curly hair bouncing with every movement. ""Hey, kiddo, do you want me to give you a ride home?"" she asked, flashing a warm smile. The clock above the soda dispenser read 10:43 PM, but there was no rush.

I shook my head with a grateful smile. ""No, I'm okay. Thank you, though.""

Ruthie's smile didn't fade. She gave me a knowing look, the kind that only someone who'd seen it all could give. ""Alright, but you be safe out there, yeah? I love ya.""

""Yeah, I will. Love you too,"" I replied, my voice light and teasing. It had been like this ever since the funeral‚ÄîRuthie had been there for me when everything felt like it was falling apart. She always knew how to brighten my days, whether it was with her jokes or just her steady presence.

As I stepped out the door and into the cool, rainy night, I felt a strange warmth inside, like a small reminder that even in this quiet town, I wasn't alone. Ruthie was like the mom I never had, always looking out for me, always making sure I had someone in my corner.¬†

I pulled out my phone as I walked down the rain-slicked sidewalk, texting Dad a quick message:¬†*Goodnight, love you, see you Monday.*¬†I hit send and slipped the phone back into my pocket, the weight of the text feeling comforting in a way. Despite the oddity of our little routines‚Äîme walking everywhere, him always looking out for me‚ÄîI knew he was there for me, just like Ruthie, in his own way.¬†

With the rain still coming down, I picked up my pace, the quiet of Dutchstone settling around me like a blanket. The streets were empty, save for a few distant headlights, and I couldn't help but feel the weight of the night, the way everything felt like it was in its own little world. It was just me, the rain, and the steady rhythm of my boots on the pavement. The text had been simple, but the words carried more than just a goodbye for the night; they were a reminder of the quiet support I had in the most unexpected places.¬†

Then something sparked my curiosity. A police cruiser sped down Carter Street, heading in the direction of the diner, past Old Continental. It was unusual for a cruiser to be driving that fast, especially this late at night. I didn't think much of it at first‚Äîmaybe kids were smoking in the library after hours again, or someone had been speeding on the quiet roads. But still, the urgency of the car, the way it cut through the stillness of the night, felt off.

Why go that fast, though? At this hour? The last time a cruiser sped like that, it was during the fire at the old mill down on Shiloh Boulevard, at the Mackey farm. I remember hearing about it on the radio‚Äîan old, abandoned building catching fire in the middle of the night, and the response time was frantic. It had been a disaster for the town, with rumors about arson swirling around for weeks. That was a year ago.

I shook my head, trying to push the thought out of my mind. It was probably just a routine call. Nothing like that was going to happen again, not in Dutchstone.

Right as I tried to focus on something else, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I pulled it out, hoping for a distraction. It was a message from Dad:¬†*Hey sweetie, early leave. See ya tomorrow.*

A small smile tugged at my lips. Dad's always a man of few words, but his messages were the steadying force in my life. I typed a quick response:¬†*Love you, see you tomorrow.*

With that, i felt the unease from the cruiser lingering in the back of my mind, but pushed aside for now. Life in Dutchstone was still quiet. Maybe too quiet. I slipped my phone from my pocket and tapped the screen, opening up my playlist. The familiar rhythm of ""Magic"" by Tony Leo filled my ears as the soft beats and soothing lyrics wrapped around me. It was one of those songs that felt like it could make everything feel just a little bit more magical, even in the middle of a dreary night. The gentle rain, the quiet streets‚Äîeverything seemed to fade away, leaving me alone with the music.

With the sound of the song in my head, I let the rhythm guide my steps. The rain was still steady, the streets of Dutchstone empty and silent, save for the occasional car passing by. I walked down Carter Street, passing the sleepy old houses, their windows dimly lit from the inside. Everything felt so familiar, yet tonight, it all seemed slightly different. The wet pavement shimmered under the streetlights, and the world felt both soft and still, like it was holding its breath.

As I walked, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was just... off. Maybe it was the rain, or maybe it was the quietness of the town, but my thoughts kept drifting back to that police cruiser. The way it had sped past the diner. The urgency. It stayed in the back of my mind, lingering like a shadow. But I couldn't focus on that now. The night felt like a blur of calm, with Tony Leo's voice guiding me through the quiet streets.

I walked past the old convenience store, the one that had been around forever, and took a quick glance toward the woods on my right. The dark trees loomed in the distance, their outlines barely visible in the low light. It was always eerie walking past those woods, even though I'd done it a million times before. Tonight, though, the silence of the woods seemed heavier, almost oppressive. I shook my head, trying to ignore the nagging feeling that crawled up my spine.

But nothing happened. Nothing at all. I just kept walking, letting the music fill my head and the steady rhythm of my footsteps soothe my thoughts. Maybe it was just the rain. Maybe it was just the fact that I was exhausted, still processing everything that had happened in the last few months.

As I turned the corner onto my street, I finally saw my house up ahead, the familiar porch light glowing in the distance. I could feel a small sense of relief settle in. Home. Safe. The end of the road for tonight.

But as I made my way closer, I couldn't shake the sense that something was waiting for me. Something just beyond the edge of my vision, like a shadow that hadn't quite fully formed.

But when I looked back down the road, everything was the same. Just another quiet night in Dutchstone.

I shook my head again. Maybe I was imagining things. It had been a long day. A long, strange day.

I pulled my hood tighter, walked up the steps to my porch, and unlocked the door. As soon as I stepped inside, the warm, familiar smell of home greeted me. The sound of rain on the roof. The soft hum of the fridge.

I let out a sigh, closing the door behind me, feeling the weight of the night slowly lift..",1,1734572418.0,WritersHelpingWriters,0,1.0,False

I've owned a 2019 Audi E-Tron prior to purchasing this as well as a 2017 RX 350 and none of them compare to this car in relation to range, efficiency, etc. 

Pros

\- Good range-ish, Tesla's estimate numbers are way off but still averaged around 260 with mixed highway+ city driving at 80% charge. 

\- Supercharger network is AMAZING. Best charging network by far. Electrify America cannot compare-> most of the chargers we went to with my Audi were broken or had a stupidly long start time. Superchargers are great. 

\- Tech is great, snappy and FSD is extremely cool. 

  
Cons 

\- Worst suspension I've ever used in my entire life. My 2007 RX400H with 213,000 miles on it rides 100x better. The MYP suspension is so stiff to the point where the cupholders are unusable. We've had to resort to holding our coffee cups when we go over bumps so that the drink doesn't spill out. It's horrible. You can feel every single little road imperfection. I live in NYC so the roads aren't paved all the time so if you are planning on buying **ANY** MYP go test drive it multiple times if needed to see how the suspension handles bumps. The roads need to be perfectly paved 100% in order for this car to be comfortable. It's even worse in the back. The front is bad but the back is horrible. It feels like a go-kart in the back for lack of better words. 

\- Road noise is always there. Even on paved roads, road noise is so loud. Feels like the windows are open every single moment when we drive. I feel like the noise over LIE at 60-65 is over 70 DB it's that loud. 

\- Rims cracking; I've had 3 rims crack on me and I've had to replace them. The first two were before 10,000 miles with normal driving which is annoying and the 21s are prone to curb rash. 



Overall I think the car is solid but it's rough on the ride and the sound deadening is horrible.

----------------------------------------------------------

Water is fundamental to our health and well-being. It plays a critical role in every bodily function, and understanding how much water you should drink each day is vital. So, how much should you actually be drinking? Let‚Äôs explore this essential question and its benefits.

### Daily Water Intake Recommendations

The commonly recommended amount of water for adults varies but a good starting point is about **8-10 cups (64-80 ounces)** per day. However, this can change based on various factors. Here are some key considerations:

- **Age:** Older adults may need less water, while younger individuals may require more.
- **Gender:** Men typically need around **3.7 liters (or 13 cups)** of total beverages per day, while women require **2.7 liters (or 9 cups)**.
- **Activity Level:** The more physically active you are, the more water you should drink to replace fluids lost through sweat.
- **Climate:** Hot or humid weather increases your water needs as you lose more sweat.
- **Health Status:** Conditions like fever, vomiting, or diarrhea can demand higher water intake.

### Understanding Your Hydration Needs

Listening to your body is key to staying hydrated. Thirst is a clear indicator that you need more water. Additionally, the color of your urine can provide insights:

Health Benefits of Staying Hydrated: More Than Just Thirst
----------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is essential for maintaining good health, and its benefits extend far beyond simply quenching your thirst. Water is vital for nearly all bodily functions, making it crucial to understand how much you should drink and how hydration positively impacts your life.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Understanding the right amount of water you should consume daily can be tricky. Many health experts suggest drinking at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, commonly known as the ""8x8 rule."" However, individual needs can vary based on factors like age, weight, and activity level. A general guideline is to drink half your body weight in ounces. For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, aim for about 80 ounces of water daily.

While thirst is a key indicator of hydration, it‚Äôs not the only one. Here are some other benefits of staying hydrated that help show just how important it is:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Boosts Energy Levels:** Dehydration can lead to fatigue and a lack of energy. When your body is well-hydrated, it functions more efficiently, helping you feel more alert and active throughout the day.
- **Improves Mood:** Drinking enough water can positively impact your mood and cognition. Studies have shown that even mild dehydration can lead to irritability and difficulty concentrating.
- **Aids Digestion:** Proper hydration is critical for digestive health. Water helps break down food, ensuring that nutrients are absorbed effectively and waste is eliminated efficiently.
- **Helps with Weight Management:** Sometimes, our bodies confuse thirst for hunger. Drinking water can help curb appetite and reduce cravings, making it easier to manage your weight.
- **Supports Healthy Skin:** Staying hydrated can promote a clear, radiant complexion. Water flushes out toxins and helps maintain skin elasticity, reducing the appearance of wrinkles.
- **Regulates Body Temperature:** Hydration is key to maintaining a stable body temperature. Water helps dissipate heat through sweat, preventing overheating during physical activities or hot weather.
- **Enhances Physical Performance:** When exercising, hydration is crucial for maintaining peak performance. Dehydration can lead to decreased strength, endurance, and overall athletic ability.
- **Promotes Kidney Health:** Adequate water intake supports kidney function by helping filter waste and toxins from the blood. This can reduce the risk of kidney stones and urinary tract infections.

If you find it challenging to drink enough water throughout the day, there are several strategies you can implement:

- **Carry a Reusable Water Bottle:** Having water on hand makes it easier to sip throughout the day.
- **Add Flavor:** If plain water seems boring, try infusing it with fruits, herbs, or citrus to enhance its taste.
- **Set Reminders:** Use your phone or calendar to remind yourself to drink water at regular intervals.
- **Track Your Intake:** Consider using an app to monitor how much water you‚Äôre consuming daily.

It‚Äôs important to drink water consistently throughout the day, rather than chugging large amounts at once. Spreading your intake out can help your body absorb it more effectively. Additionally, consider the environment and lifestyle factors that might increase your hydration needs. High temperatures, humidity, and physical exertion all lead to increased fluid loss, making it even more critical to stay on top of your hydration.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Remember that while water is essential, you can also meet hydration needs through foods with high water content, such as fruits and vegetables. Cucumber, watermelon, and oranges are great choices that contribute to your daily intake.

By prioritizing hydration in your daily routine, you‚Äôre taking a significant step towards enhancing your overall health and well-being. So, the next time you reach for a drink, remember that water is not just a thirst quencher; it‚Äôs a cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle.

How Lifestyle and Environment Affect Your Water Needs
-----------------------------------------------------

Your body needs water to function properly, but the amount necessary can vary widely based on different factors in your lifestyle and environment. Understanding these influences can help you meet your hydration needs more effectively, enhancing your health and well-being.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
A significant factor in determining how much water you should drink daily is your level of physical activity. If you exercise regularly or have a job that requires movement, you will likely sweat more and lose fluids faster. This increased loss means you will need to replenish your body with additional water. Ideally, include hydration before, during, and after your workouts to stay balanced. Here are some guidelines:

- **Light Activity:** If you engage in light exercise, consider drinking an additional 1-2 cups of water.
- **Moderate Activity:** During moderate workouts, aim for about 2-3 cups of water.
- **Intense Activity:** High-intensity workouts may require up to 4-6 cups of water or more.

Another key aspect that affects your hydration needs is your environment. Places with hot and humid weather can lead to increased sweating, exacerbating fluid loss. Similarly, spending time at high altitudes often causes rapid breathing and increased urination, translating to a greater need for water. Pay attention to how these environments make you feel. If you notice symptoms like dryness or fatigue, it may be a sign to drink more fluids.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Your age also plays a role in determining your hydration needs. Younger individuals often have a higher metabolism and can easily lose fluids through increased activity levels. As we age, our bodies may signal thirst less effectively. Older adults should therefore proactively drink water, even if they don‚Äôt feel thirsty, to maintain optimal hydration. In general, here‚Äôs a simple breakdown:

- **Children and Teens:** Depending on their activity level, they may need between 6-8 cups per day.
- **Adults:** The typical recommendation is about 8-10 cups, but those who are active may need more.
- **Older Adults:** Aiming for at least 6-8 cups is advisable, regardless of thirst.

Diet can also significantly influence hydration levels. Foods with high water content, such as fruits and vegetables‚Äîlike watermelon, cucumbers, and oranges‚Äîcan contribute to your daily intake. On the other hand, salty and processed foods may encourage more thirst, calling for a need to drink additional water. Understanding your diet helps you better calculate your drinking habits.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Let‚Äôs consider specific behaviors and habits that affect hydration:

- **Alcohol Consumption:** Beverages like alcohol can lead to dehydration. If you choose to drink, balance it with an extra glass of water for each alcoholic drink.
- **Caffeine Intake:** While caffeine can have a mild diuretic effect, moderate use is typically fine for hydration. However, if you consume excessive coffee or energy drinks, consider increasing your water intake.
- **Weather Conditions:** In cooler months, you might not feel as thirsty; however, indoor heating can dry out the air and your skin. Stay aware and hydrated regardless of temperature.

Individual health conditions can influence your water needs. For instance, pregnancy or breastfeeding increases the requirement for fluids due to the demands on the body. Certain medical conditions, like diabetes or kidney disease, may also necessitate a different hydration strategy. Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best hydration plan tailored to your needs.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Your hydration needs depend on your lifestyle, environment, diet, age, habits, and health status. Recognizing how these factors interact empowers you to make informed choices about your water intake. Always keep a water bottle handy and listen to your body. Staying properly hydrated is crucial for ensuring you feel your best each day.

Some months ago I went next door to a convenience store to get some coffee. When I returned I let her and my other coworker know they were giving away donuts. She asked ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you bring us any?‚Äù I thought she was joking, so I laughed and answered that I had my hands full. She proceeded to tell me I should have asked for a bag, and kept pushing how selfish I was for not bringing them any. I finally said ‚Äúyou have legs and feet. It‚Äôs a beautiful day. You can walk over just as I did.‚Äù She snaps back ‚ÄúThat is rude! You‚Äôre mean!‚Äù 

She doesn‚Äôt approve that I don‚Äôt let customers trauma dump on me. It‚Äôs simply not my job description and I‚Äôm incredibly busy most days. Being the only CSR, my work piles up. If I allow customers to tell me their tragic life story for 30+ minutes, I would be so backed up. Which is more stress on top of my current stress. Plus, I struggle with anxiety. When people trauma dump, I‚Äôm very empathetic. And not in a good way. It actually causes me to go to a dark place because I automatically put myself in their position. This is why I can‚Äôt watch many horror films. It‚Äôs too hard to separate fiction from ‚Äúwhat if this could actually happen to me?‚Äù I don‚Äôt need that at work. It‚Äôs not my responsibility to carry the weight of other people‚Äôs misfortunes. I have to set boundaries or I will be a wreck in more ways than one. It‚Äôs also rather uncomfortable to me when complete strangers use me as a sounding board for their trauma. So I offer as sincere condolences as I can muster and get them back to the task needing done.  My coworker lets them keep her on the phone to talk, cry, etc. She has accused me of being cold and apathetic. And I actually am starting to believe it.

She once told me ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt exactly call you sociable and friendly‚Äù simply because I‚Äôm an introvert. 

Before working with her I‚Äôve always thought of myself as kind, empathetic, friendly, sociable, and thoughtful. She has me believing I‚Äôm the opposite of all that. All because I‚Äôm selective and I set strong boundaries to protect my mental health. That‚Äôs all. I‚Äôm not heartless. I‚Äôm not selfish. I‚Äôm not cold. I‚Äôm not unfriendly. I‚Äôm just one person and I have limits. If I let customers push those limits, what will be left for the people I actually love? She doesn‚Äôt see me outside of work and how fiercely protective I am of my inner circle. She only knows the person she‚Äôs worked with for three years. She only knows the work me. Not the real me. Not the person my friends know, my family, my husband. For her to attack my character like this. Why?

Why is she so determined to make me feel like a bad person and twist everything I‚Äôve ever known and believed about myself? How do I not let her get to me to the point I do turn into the person she‚Äôs making me believe I am? ",28,1734571450.0,coworkerstories,7,1.0,False
1hhhcap,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hhhcap,"1 Day in New River Gorge National Park, West Virginia, U.S.A.","Back in September, I had to go to West Virginia in the U.S. for a wedding. Being from the northeast, I haven‚Äôt had many opportunities in my life to go to any U.S. National Parks, as the closest one to me is hundreds and hundreds of miles away.

As soon as I knew I had to go that far out for the wedding, I instantly decided to make the most of having to go so far away. I tacked one more day onto the stay I was going to have, and I went to New River Gorge National Park & Preserve, the 63rd and most recently designated U.S. National Park, the day before I had to be around for the wedding.

I started my day in the nearby town of Fayetteville, which had a town reading they are one of the ‚ÄúCoolest Small Towns in America.‚Äù Admittedly, I didn‚Äôt think much of this when I saw the sign since there are so many things like that. I stopped by the local Range Finder Coffee to get some breakfast and a coffee because I had just finished my seven hour drive to West Virginia. I have to admit it; I was wrong. This town was amazing, and I fell in love just in this tiny coffee shop. The walls were covered in decorations showing the owner‚Äôs personality, a cat was roaming the restaurant, and, most of all, the low population of the town was allowing the staff to hang out with the little community around them when there wasn‚Äôt a customer waiting, which was often. I hanged around here way longer than I thought and was taught all about the area from the shop‚Äôs patrons before I headed off for the park.

What I quickly learned is that New River Gorge Park is known for its fog, a lot of it. I hiked along the Endless Wall Trail to the Diamond Point Overlook, where all of my first three pictures were taken. I spent over an hour here, just sitting. Since this was my first national park, I was blown away by the natural beauty of this place. I watched as the fog slowly faded away and revealed more of the area, and it was worth every second of the wait.

I circled back and made my way around other highlights of the park. Another favorite part of my day was walking down to Sandstone Falls, and pictures six and seven are what it looked like along the way and at the viewpoint. Were it not for daylight running out, I would have sat in and took it all in, just like I did with Diamond Point Overlook. It was a long and winding drive to get to the trailhead for Sandstone Falls, but the beauty of the hike and viewpoint itself made it infinitely worth it.

I finished up the day by going to the main viewpoint, the Grandview Overlook. This was a perfect place to end the day, as it was a simple drive up to the area‚Äôs visitor center followed by a very short walk to the viewpoint. My final two pictures were taken from this point, but they don‚Äôt do the wide view of the park justice. I could not have ended my journey through the park any better.

I wrapped up my day by heading back to Fayetteville and eating at Secret Sandwich Society. The service staff was so kind, and I had the greatest sweet tea of my life. I highly recommend stopping here if you‚Äôre in this town. There aren‚Äôt many options due to how small the town is, so it‚Äôs very easy to find.

Overall, this was a wonderful experience for me and will always be propelled in my memory due to it being my first U.S. National Park. If you‚Äôre at all interested in going, I can‚Äôt stress the importance of giving yourself plenty of time to go through the park. Accessing the different trails requires a lot of driving around to reach the numerous trailheads. I thought I gave myself plenty of time by showing up at 9am, but I was still even rushing myself. If possible, two days would really allow you to take it all in and still have time to experience it. Additionally, I can‚Äôt mention it enough: Fayetteville is amazing. If you have the extra time or are just looking for something quick to eat, a stop here is a must.

If any of you are undecided on an upcoming trip or are looking to see one of the less popular parks, New River Gorge is a must!",2,1734571414.0,travel,1,1.0,False

Cash Donations

1. Peer-to-Peer Giving: Hand small amounts of cash directly to individuals, empowering them to decide how to use it.


2. Gift Cards: Provide prepaid cards for grocery stores, fast-food restaurants, or public transit. These are practical and offer flexibility.


3. Pay-It-Forward Assistance: Pay for someone‚Äôs meal, hotel stay, or transportation directly when they express the need.



Supplies

4. Customized Backpacks: Fill backpacks with essentials like hygiene items, socks, gloves, water bottles, snacks, and first-aid kits.

6. Phone/Data Access: Provide prepaid cell phones or phone cards to help people stay connected to resources and loved ones.


7. Recycled Essentials: Donate gently used tents, sleeping bags, or durable clothing directly to encampments or individuals.



Food

8. Snack Packs: Assemble small, portable food kits with non-perishable items like granola bars, fruit cups, and bottled water.


9. Cooked Meals: Prepare and distribute home-cooked meals or partner with food trucks to provide free food directly on the street.



Services

10. Laundry Assistance: Offer laundry services by paying for their washing at laundromats or providing detergent.


11. Haircuts and Grooming: Work with local barbers to give free haircuts or donate grooming kits.


12. Transportation: Help with bus passes, train tickets, or ride-share credits for appointments, job interviews, or shelter access.



Building Connections

13. Conversations and Coffee: Take time to listen to their stories and share a warm beverage. A kind conversation can make someone feel valued.


14. Local Knowledge: Provide maps or printouts of local shelters, food banks, and free services. Better yet, walk them through the options.



Long-Term Impact

15. Personalized Assistance: Address specific needs, like replacing lost IDs, paying a bill, or assisting with housing application fees.


16. Skill-Based Support: Help with resumes, job applications, or teaching a useful skill.


17. Rent Assistance: If someone is on the verge of losing housing, help cover their rent or utilities.



Unique Ideas

18. Offer Storage: Provide sturdy bags or containers where they can store their belongings securely.


19. Free Repair Services: Mend clothing, tents, or shoes for those who rely on them daily.


20. Customized Kits: Talk to individuals to find out exactly what they need most (e.g., art supplies for someone creative, tools for someone handy).



Collaboration

21. Pay Local Vendors: Work with nearby restaurants, laundromats, or stores to set up tabs for people to use when needed.


22. Sponsor a Meal Train: Organize with others to bring meals or resources directly to a small group or encampment regularly.



The best approach is to build trust and offer contributions with no strings attached. Even a simple act of kindness can profoundly impact someone‚Äôs day or outlook.

1hhha9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hhha9y/aita_for_getting_upset_with_my_friend_who_has/,AITA for getting upset with my friend who has ADHD for forgetting to respond to me?,"Hello lovely people of Reddit. This is my first post here so apologies if it's not to standard, Im just really miffed about this whole situation and need some outside perspective.

I (22F) recently got upset with my friend 'Shane' (21M) for repeatedly not responding to my attempts for us to hang out. For context, Shane has diagnosed ADHD and I myself have undiagnosed autism (before anyone comes at me for that, I'm in the process of getting it official, I have been trying for years. I am Aboriginal so there's an extra layer of complexity whereby some of my beliefs and practices don't align with some of the DSM-5 criteria (E.g. stuff like social isolation but community is important in my culture). Anyways Shane himself has told me he 100% thinks I am, undiagnosed conditions are still valid.) One of my best friends also has diagnosed ADHD and my partner is in the process of getting diagnosed with ADHD, so my whole circle is neurodivergent. 

I'll mention this now, because it becomes relevant later. Shane reached out to me after I had dinner at his place to tell me he was offended by my jokes and thought I came across as judgmental and disparaging. He went further to say that this also applied to the whole few years that he's known me, and said I was rarely positive towards him. Imagine my surprise upon hearing this, because I have always interpreted our interactions as lighthearted and comfortable, and our jokes as funny and non serious.

When I say jokes, I dont mean I was making fun of his ADHD. In this case, the bit he mentioned that upset him was when he asked if I wanted salad with fried rice and I did the whole ""who on earth wants salad with fried rice!"" Thing. The stuff he asked me not to talk about regarding his ADHD were things I would say like ""oh look who's late again, surprise surprise haha."" I've made jokes like the for the years I've known him because I thought he knew I was joking. Anyways, of course I profusely apologised and explained that it was probably just me being autistic, I never meant to cause any harm and I'm not good with words. I pointed out that actions are my love language and gave a few examples of the times I've showed I've cared about him instead of told him, to which he seemed to understand. He also asked me to stop joking about his ADHD in conversations because that's where he took the most offense, and I agreed. The situation seemed to be resolved... Or so I thought. 

After this interaction, I tried reaching out to Shane to arrange for us to hang out. I sent a message on October 24th asking to meet up. We message back and forth a few times, Shane starts with quick replies and then they drop off. I ask what time, he responds the next day, I ask where, he responds three days later type thing. This goes on until the 10th of November, with still nothing arranged and both up us going away after that for a while. I'm a bit upset at this point because I've spent weeks trying to arrange something.

Here was the icing on the cake for me though. I just finished having coffee at a local cafe with a friend where I see Shane with (who I thought at the time) was one of our mutuals. I'm a bit saddened by this, because I'm my mind all I can think is that he was somehow able to arrange the multiple responses and steps that it takes to hang out with someone, just not me. Keep in mind that this has happened to me before with other friends with ADHD, and I have always been able to reach out to them to remind them that I exist and it has always been fine. 

I let more time go by, waiting for Shane to reach out to me this time. I get an email saying that he had added me as a reference for applying online to rentals. I'm a little annoyed, both because he didn't ask me beforehand and because he rememberd me, but only to use as a reference. The next day he messages me and brings it up, asking if it's okay. I say of course and don't mention any frustration about the issue.

Here's the but where I might be the asshole. I send a short message, asking if we're okay and that I felt like he wasn't putting much effort into our friendship. I mentioned that seeing him with another friend made me feel a bit sad because I had been wanting to do that with him for a few weeks now. He replied saying that he was sorry for not replying, and that he hung out with a a friend from an intensive course during a lunch break. He said this situation wasn't unique to me.

I was ready to leave it at that, I asked if I was just overthinking everything and he said yes. He asked if everything was okay on my end and I said i think I was sad that we just hadn't hung out in ages. Here's where it gets spicy though, he sends another message saying that he didn't think I was being fair, that I should know he struggles due to his disability and that I was guilt tripping him for bringing up his lunch break with the other friend.

This threw me off guard, I was not expecting to be accused of ableism and guilt tripping. So I tell him I think asking what's going on after a month of attempting to reach out is reasonable, and that I have never blamed him for having ADHD or expected him to ask for everyone else. I draw the parallel of when he reached out to me about how my jokes offended him, and said that just as he is allowed to reach out to clarify something, I am as well. I also say that just because someone has a disability it's not okay to expect them to be okay with everything, and thay it's fair to expect a certain level of effort in a friendship (at this point I'm just justifying my initial message, to me the situation had been clarified and I was ready to drop it if he was). I also said it was rude to accuse me of guilt tripping, and that I only brought up his friend to explain my thought process; if he is able to plan and do things with other people, why not me? I said I thought this was a fair thing to think and that other people in my shoes would probably think the same thing. 

Shane then gets more defensive. He says that this entire conversation is blaming him for having ADHD symptoms (not even paraphrasing), that bring up our earlier conversation was just to flip things back on him and that I obviously still wasn't over it, and that I was doing a lot more than just clarifying, that I was sending paragraphs of guilt tripping and being rude. He proceeds to say that I should've gone over to home when he was with his friend and he would have planned something then, but now he didn't want to anymore because I was being rude. He sends another message saying that he was busy and had to go, and to ""have a nice holiday season.""

At this point I'm quite upset. It really felt like he went from 0-100 very quick and said some unnice things, basically saying that because of this he didn't even want to hang out anymore. I said that my initial message was clarifying, I asked if we were okay and explained my thoughts and feelings, I thought it was as tame a message as I could've possibly sent. I also had to reiterate that still, not at any point have I blamed him for having ADHD, and that to me it was about him, as a friend, putting in the time and effort to connect with me through whatever means. 

This bit stands out to me, we've never had this issue before. I've known him for years, and we have always found a way to hang out. I've always been patient with his ADHD, responding slow has never bothered me because when he did eventually get back to me we were always able to plan something definitive. This time that pattern was broken, for some reason it was always one message replies and there was never any planning. I really feel like it started after he reached out to me about my autistic behaviour, and whereby I saw a different pattern I needed to clarify it. I said as much to him.

I also said that I'm always going to be thinking about that conversation, because I'm terrified of upsetting him again. He said that applying what he said to all our prior conversations was overexaggerating, but I said it wasn't, because at the time he literally said he noticed it the whole time he's known me. At this point I said I thought everything I've said so far has been reasonable, that I was just expressing myself and that I hadn't said anything rude or blamed his disability. I also said that it would have been rude to walk up to him and his friend that one time, and that it wasn't even an option for me because -and he knows this- I have diagnosed social anxiety. 

I finish things off by asking how he can accuse me of blaming his disability when everyone I know, myself included, is neurodivergent. I have literally talked to Shane about ableism before, we have joked about people who mean harm to people like us. I said his last message was spiteful, and that I really hoped his comments were made out of anger and that he didn't actually mean them.

He has seen these messages but has yet to reply. I'm just anxious and upset about this entire situation. I was hoping he would be understanding and work to come to understanding just like I did when he reached out. I'm unsure if what I said was fair or not, my close friend who also has ADHD said that she understands the struggle of forgetting to reply but he went too far by saying I was guilt tripping him and blaming his ADHD. She said he was using his disability as an excuse for shitty behaviour.

So I bring this to you Reddit. AITA in this situation? 

TLDR: I (22F) reached out to my friend Shane (21M), who has ADHD, after weeks of him not responding to my attempts to hang out. We had always been able to hang out for years prior to this and I've always been patient, slow responses had never been a Problem until now. I expressed feeling hurt when I saw him with someone else, given his lack of effort with me. He accused me of guilt-tripping him and blaming his ADHD, which I denied, saying I was only clarifying my feelings like he had done previously about taking my jokes seriously and misreading my tone (I‚Äôm autistic). The conversation escalated quickly, with Shane saying he didn‚Äôt want to make plans anymore and implying I was being rude. I‚Äôm now upset and confused because I thought my message was reasonable and patient. Was I out of line?",0,1734571238.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

To everyone with little and no weight progress, get off the scale and focus on how you feel!

It wasn‚Äôt possible for me to see it in the moment, so I know it‚Äôs hard, but I have full confidence in IF.

Why I did it - persistent weight gain, non-alcoholic fatty liver, highish cholesterol and blood pressure. Also low energy, generally feeling bad, and bad skin. Basic approach was no breakfast. All these issues completely resolved over about a year, and my resting heart rate went from ~80 to 50 over two years!!!

Started off 14/10 because it was the best I could manage. Committed to clean fasting, just water and black coffee. I‚Äôm pretty sure I lost no weight for 4-6 months, but I did feel less bloated, better in clothes, better energy and better skin.

After that period of time I got frustrated by the lack of weight loss, and went to 15/9. Another few months of slow progress on weight, but (most importantly) FEELING much better, and I got a rowing machine which I started to use 10 mins 4x/week.

It had been about a year when I finally felt like I could effortlessly do 16/8, and I significantly increased my rowing, 30 mins 5x/week. The last year is when I lost the vast majority of the weight.",61,1734571185.0,intermittentfasting,2,1.0,False

The first call from Melvin came in at 2:00 am on a Friday night. Seeing who it was, I decided to let it go to voice mail. Then the calls continued. First it was every 15 minutes, then every half hour. Finally I just turned my phone volume off completely. I had shit to do. 

Early the next morning I was deep in a South Georgia cypress swamp hunting a large Sasquatch that had been stealing hogs from a nearby farm situated on the edge of the swamp. It was a hot and very humid morning. The air was heavy and thick. Thank God I had remembered my snake boots because the cotton mouths were thicker than pubic lice on a street whore. 

As I made my way through the swamp I finally found a piece of dry ground. What a fucking relief that was. I needed a break. I got out of the water and onto dry ground, leaned up against a tree, and lit up a nice Nicaraguan puro cigar. By this time it was around 9:00 am, the sun was beating down, and I was sweating like a n!gg#r writing a love letter. 

Now let me tell you, just as soon as I got my stick burning good I started hearing this hissing sound coming from behind me. ‚ÄúOh shit‚Äù, I thought. I already knew what it was. But I did not know how big it was. 

I slowly turned my head and scanned the land until I saw it. There it was: a Goddamn alligator no less than 12 feet in length laying at the waters edge, only 6 feet away from me. Not particularly eager to get back into the water I decided to waste this fucking lizard. My rifle was slung over my shoulder. I decided to pull my pistol. 

As I was reaching into my waders to pull my .480 revolver I saw a huge black hand come up out of the water just behind the gator. I froze. I just stood there and watched. The hand grabbed the big alligator by its tail and with a sudden jerk it yanked it off the bank and into the water. 

The water then literally exploded! The gator was going ape shit crazy, going into a death roll trying to get loose from whatever grabbed it. I backed away and shouldered my rifle, putting the nightmarish commotion in my reflex sight as I flipped off the safety. I was carrying my AR-10 this morning. 

Then the unspeakable happened! The creature that grabbed the alligator by its tail stood up out of the water. It was a goddamn bigfoot!! The fucker stood a good 9-10 feet tall and was massive. The monster was holding the thrashing gator in a bear hug. Despite the size of the reptile and its enormous strength, the Bigfoot had it under control with what appeared to be a minimum effort. 

Now all this happened very fast. In fact it happened too fast for me to even think about getting a shot off. The Bigfoot then took hold of the alligator‚Äôs head with one hand and in one quick move it opened its massive jaws and bit the gator‚Äôs head clean off! 

‚ÄúMOTHERFUCKER!!‚Äù, I thought to myself. This was one of the most aggressive and violent attacks I have ever seen from a Sasquatch. It was simultaneously frightening and exhilarating. 

The Bigfoot then opened its hands and arms and let the lifeless alligator fall into the water with a giant splash. It was a mic drop moment. I was still in position and ready to fire. The Bigfoot then turned its attention on me. It was a big son of a bitch. It was sopping wet with  solid black matted hair and it made a wheezing sound as it breathed. 

Apparently, the Bigfoot crawled underwater up to the little island I was on when it attacked the alligator. I don‚Äôt know if it was hunting and I just happened to be there or what. Suddenly, a thought occurred to me. What if I tried to communicate with the Sasquatch! 

It stood only about 8 feet from me, still standing in the murky swamp water as it stared at me. I slowly lowered my rifle to my side, keeping eye contact with it. I then took my left hand off my rifle and raised it slowly and held up my open hand as is waiving hello. 

The beast began to sway back and forth. Then it huffed at me. I lowered my left hand. It‚Äôs eyes slowly moved between me and the rifle I was holding at my side. Then I said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, buddy. I‚Äôm not going to hurt you.‚Äù

It stood and stared at me a moment longer. Then, for whatever reason, it turned and started walking away from me through the water. Curiously, it made hardly a sound as it glided through the swamp muck. Clearly, it saw me as posing no threat. But it left the remains of the alligator. Was it hunting that gator, or did it attack and kill it because it was threatening me? I‚Äôll never know. 

I stood and watched as the large Bigfoot retreated into the swamp. Then I quickly raised my rifle, put my sight on the back of its head, and blew the fucker‚Äôs brains out all over the swamp in a glorious explosion of red blood and brains! The big fucker fell with a huge splash, creating waves in the water that reached the edge of the little island on which I stood. I was quite pleased with myself, and deservingly so. 

I pulled out my phone to call the farmer that hired me to kill this creature and asked him to meet me at the back-side of his property with his 4-wheeler. I noticed that old Melvin had been blowing up my phone with calls and voice mails. ‚ÄúWhat a fucking asshole‚Äù, I thought to myself. 

I pulled out my rope from my pack, tied up the fucking Sasquatch, and dragged it out of the swamp. It was not as hard as it sounds, though, since I was pulling it through the water. I got to the back-end of the farmer‚Äôs property and met the guy. We pulled the rotten beast out of the swamp with his 4-wheeler. 

We got that big bitch up to his barn. All wide-eyed, he asked me what we were going to do with the monster. I told him that he needed to bury it ASAP because the Sasquatch‚Äôs buddies would eventually smell it and would bring down hell on him and his farm. This caused him great concern. I then offered to haul off the corpse ... for an extra $500.00. He was none to happy with what he called a ‚Äúhidden charge‚Äù, but fuck him. 

I had already cut the farmer a deal. Instead of my usual $5,000.00 Bigfoot removal fee, I did it for him for $3,500.00 and a blowjob from his wife. He did not want to spend another $500.00, but he had no choice. So, he coughed up the cash. Then I said, ‚ÄúOK, Cletus, now go get Ethel down here to empty my ball sacks.‚Äù 

The farmer said ‚ÄúHell, General, I didn‚Äôt think you was serious about THAT!‚Äù I looked at him in silence for a moment. Then I reached for the pistol on my hip and started pulling it out of my holster. ‚ÄúOK, OK!! Put yer gun up!! I‚Äôll go get Ethel!!‚Äù, he said. 

I got my money then made the farmer sit there on a bale of hay and watch as his old lady sucked my dry. We then threw the dead Sasquatch in the back of my truck and I headed out. About a mile down the road I pulled over on the side of the road and dumped out the body. It was a smelly son of a bitch!! It got all wet in that stinking swamp water then simmered in the hot Georgia sun. But fuck it. Buzzards got to eat too. 

I arrived home at 5:00pm Saturday evening. I  decided I would stay in for the evening. The hot, humid swamp had sapped all my energy. Plus I was covered in mosquito bites and a half dozen snake bites. 

The first thing I did was take a long, hot shower to get the stink of the swamp and the muddy, stinky Sasquatch off me. That fucking wet Sasquatch stench lingers a long fucking time. That‚Äôs one of the reasons I smoke cigars: to mask the smell. 

Finally I was able to retire to my recliner situated in my den. Wearing only my crimson velour smoking jacket, loosely tied, I sat down and relaxed. I was about halfway through an AF Opus X, and I had just poured myself a glass of Glenlivet 18. My faithful dog, Admiral Sasquatch, stood dutifully beside me as I reclined, and I stroked the fur on the back of her neck. 

Suddenly I heard a female voice purr my name, ‚ÄúGeeeeeeeennraaaaal‚Ä¶‚Äù.  Greatly startled, as I expected nobody else to be there but me and the Admiral, I instinctively grabbed my HK USP .45 acp from its holster sewn into the side of my La-Z-Boy, where it stays cocked and loaded, spun off the recliner, aimed in the direction of the voice, and opened fire. 

I dumped the entire mag in less than two seconds. Before I realized who it was, one-half of the target‚Äôs head was blown off and hanging upside down off her shoulder by a narrow strip of flesh. Then the body collapsed in the doorway where it stood. ‚ÄúWHUMP!‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh Shit!‚Äù, I said. It was that bar slut I took home last night! She had a liquor name... Brandy, or  some shit. I forgot about her. Then a much more dreadful thought came to mind: what the fuck was she STILL doing at my house?!?! Proper etiquette dictates that bar sluts are to exit the house by 8:00 am sharp in a discreet and civilized manner. 

Shit, I had really dodged a fucking bullet with this bitch! She was some kind of psycho bitch or something. Imagine, sitting here in my house all day waiting for me to get home. That‚Äôs some scary shit! 

Oh well, I decided to sit back down and finish my drink. I needed to relax after all the excitement and stress of the day. I‚Äôll clean up the mess that bitch made later. I laid my head back into my leather recliner and before I knew it I was fast asleep. 

I woke up at around 2:30 am Sunday morning by my phone vibrating. It had been sitting on my armrest when I sat down and must have fallen onto my lap while I slept. Then I noticed I still had half a glass of Scotch in my hand. Fuck, I had been plum tuckered out when I sat down. I got up to take a leak. 

I glanced over at Brandy, or whatever her name was. Amazingly, all the blood and brain was gone off the floor and walls. I looked over at the Admiral and in a high, cartoonish voice like you use to talk to dogs,  said ‚ÄúGOOD GIRL!!‚Äù She was very pleased at the recognition and started wagging her tail. 

I got me a little bite to eat, fed the Admiral, then sat down in my chair again. I decided to flip on the television news to see if Trump had issued the Kill Order yet to get rid of those BLM and Antifa vermin slithering all over America‚Äôs streets. ‚ÄúGoddamnit!‚Äù, I thought to myself, ‚ÄúIf Don would call me I would assemble my Sasquatch Operations crew and absolutely DESTROY all of those commie fuckers in under a week. 

It took about 30 seconds to get disgusted with those leftist puddles of rat piss, then I turned off the TV. It was late, but I was not really sleepy at this point. I looked over at my coffee table and at my magazines laying there. ‚ÄúAHHHH...‚Äù I said to myself when I remembered that I had just received my monthly edition of ‚ÄúAnal Masters‚Äù magazine. 

I was just just perusing mag, checking out the monthly columns and such, when my goddamned phone started vibrating again. Now, just so you will understand The General‚Äôs mindset, I hate people. I just fucking hate them. I like a handful of individuals, but I generally hate human beings. Therefore, each time my phone rings there is a 99% chance - minimum - that it will agitate me. 

I picked up my phone and looked at it. It was Melvin...AGAIN!! This motherfucker has been blowing up my phone for 24 straight hours now. I sighed, knowing that it was probably important. Given that I once waived a loaded gun in his face for interrupting me during a game of chess with his grandkid, old Melvin would not interrupt me, let alone blow up my phone unless it was something VERY IMPORTANT. 

I took mental note that something serious was troubling old Melvin and that apparently good old The General is the only one who can help. I also sighed at the inconvenience it may cause me. But then I recalled the saying that to all great men of wealth and power comes great responsibility. ‚ÄúOK‚Äù, I said to myself‚Äù, I‚Äôll talk to old Melvin and see what I can do for him‚Äù. I was going to call him back...right after I finish my night‚Äôs sleep. I leaned back in my chair, reached over to turn off the lamp, and went to sleep. 

I woke up around 2:30 pm Sunday afternoon. I was a little pissed at myself because I wanted to get to the firing range by noon. I got a shooting buddy I wanted to meet up with, and he shoots at 12-noon every Sunday. See, he has this super hot wife that I am trying to fuck and I figure hanging with the hubby will get me closer to her! 

But my plans were blown to shit. But at least I got some rest. As I go to take a piss I notice the bar slut still laying there on the floor. I‚Äôm thinking ‚ÄúFUCK!‚Äù. Sigh ... I guess I need to get rid of the fucking body this afternoon before I do anything else. Then I remember old Melvin.  

I decided the body can wait a little longer. I would make a cup of nice coffee for myself to enjoy, during which I will call old Melvin and see what the fuck he needs. And that‚Äôs exactly what I did. I made me a large K-Cup of medium roast, sat down at my kitchen table, and called old Melvin. 

Now folks, before I get into my conversation with Melvin, you got to know a couple things. You need to know a little bit about Melvin, and you need to know about how Melvin and I get along. 

The first thing you got to know is that old Melvin is the Grand Wizard of the South Ga KKK. I know, most of you folks just got triggered and are on the phone calling 911 to report a hate crime. Well, cool your jets and simmer down. The fact is, today‚Äôs KKK is not as bad as advertised. Hell, they raise money for crippled kids (white crippled kids) and to help little old (white) ladies bury their men. They even sponsored a recent trip sending a bunch of (white) school children to see the White House. The fact is they do not hate blacks any more. They just like whites a whole lot more. 

Now, that said, The General does not get along too well with the KKK. Once a long time ago I was out in the woods squatch hunting late at night when a drunk group of these sheet wearing fuckwits came into my woods looking for a tree to use to lynch some negro they had with them and tied up. 

I sat quietly, just a few yards away, and watched those crazy hooded f#ggots in secret. When they strung up the poor black guy and dropped him it kind of disturbed me, like it had gone way too far. So I raised my rifles, shot the rope, causing it to split, and the black man fell to the ground. He was obviously hurt, but he was still alive. 

Now, I can‚Äôt confess to exactly what happened next. I‚Äôll just say that the local KKK membership numbers dropped suddenly and significantly as the result of acute lead poisoning. Of course, that cannot be relied upon for 100% accuracy because none of the bodies were ever found. 

The black guy was a 16 yr old kid named Lucious. I took him home with me and gave him a job on my farm doing chores and such. I even gave him a place to live - a little cabin out back with an earthen floor and a little cot in it. Lucious worked for food and board. The boy was a damn good worker too. 

I ended up putting Lucious through college and helped him get a job with the Atlanta office of the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was a great job and he is pulling in big bucks. Hell, Lucious thought of The General as a father figure, what with his daddy leaving right after he was born. 

But for all I did for that boy, I just could not clean all the darkness out of him. About 2 years after he went off to Atlanta he started dating this real militant black chick who was into BLM and the New Black Panthers. He changed, and not for the better. Not long after that I heard he was shot to death in a crack deal that went bad. And so goes that old saying, ‚ÄúYou can take a black man out of the ghetto, but you cannot ever take the ghetto out of a black man.‚Äù 

I reflect on this story now and again. Was saving Lucious from being lynched worth it? To me, yes. But to old Lucious, probably not. With my help he was able to reach heights he never dreamed of reaching. But in the end it just meant he had a longer way to fall.  But I don‚Äôt form any judgment. A man has got to do for himself. 

So after the sudden mass extinction of a bunch of KKK f#ggots, eventually the group started showing itself again, and old Melvin became the leader. After networking with other chapters he started getting real powerful, eventually Melvin was awarded title of Grand Dragon. In his world he is king. He is the lord of his domain. His kingdom is his, and his alone. 

In my world Melvin is a half-assed heating and a/c repairman. In fact, I first met old Melvin when I needed someone quick to fix my heater in the middle of the winter. It was the weekend and we got hit with a cold front bringing unusually frigid air into the Deep South. Melvin was the only one I could get out to my house. 

Well, old Melvin managed to get my heat back on, at least long enough for me to get a real tech out there. While Melvin was in my house he saw the two life size mounts of Sasquatch in my living room. He said ‚ÄúDamn! Them shore is sum big critters. What is they? Bears?‚Äù I explained to him what they were. ‚ÄúShit fire! I thought them critters only existed out thar in the Specific Northwest!‚Äù, he replied. 

The silly bastard then told me about some weird shit that had been going on out in the woods when he and his buddies got together on the weekends. He said trees would be pushed over, and small ones would be tied in knots. He even claimed to have seen large humanoid footprints. I asked if anyone cast them. He replied ‚ÄúCast them? Nah, we was too tore up bout them to go fishin‚Äô‚Äù, he said. 

Due to a momentary lapse of reason I asked ‚ÄúSo, are these occurrences at you and your buddies‚Äô hunting camp?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúNah, it where me and my Klan brothers meet‚Äù. I said ‚ÄúKlan? You mean the KKK?‚Äù Melvin nodded eagerly, then pulled out a card with ‚ÄúKKK‚Äù on it and identifying him as a ‚ÄúGrand Dragon‚Äù. 

At this point I am ready to kick his silly ass out of my house. But, he was doing me a solid, so I let him finish the job. He went on and on with unsolicited information about his little KKK club and what they do. Finally he finished his work and got up his shit to leave. As he was walking to the door he invited me to their next rally. Looking him square in the eye I said ‚ÄúNo thank you. I‚Äôm Muslim.‚Äù He got a funny look on his face then left. ‚ÄúFuck him‚Äù, I thought. 

A couple weeks later Melvin stopped by my house unannounced one evening all shook up. It seems that during the rally he invited me to they were harassed by what he said was two creatures. They had rocks thrown at them and heard intimidating vocalizations. One small group of the KKK boys were even bluff charged by a ‚Äúlarge, black, bipedal creature‚Äù while making their way out of the woods.

Melvin said ‚ÄúMr. General, you gots to help me! Them monsters is keeping us from a‚Äôholdin our Klan rallies!‚Äù I asked why couldn‚Äôt they just hold their rallies somewhere else. He said they hold their rallies there because it was some kind of white Supremacist sacred ground that they had been using for years. I don‚Äôt know anything about all that, of course, but whatever. 

I told Melvin, ‚ÄúLook, I hunt and kill Sasquatch for a living. I do it because nobody else can. I charge a flat rate of $5,000.00 per Sasquatch. So if you have two of them on your property I would need $10,000.00 cash up front, with a money back guarantee. If I only catch one, then I keep half of the fee and refund the other five grand. But I have been doing this a long time so if there are two out there, then I will get two of them. If there is more than two, then I get an extra $2,500.00 a head over two creatures.‚Äù 

Old Melvin took off his greasy CAT hat, rubbed his head, and said ‚ÄúWell, gee, General, that thar is a lot of money. Do you think we can work out something where we pay ya in installment payments after you catch them critters?‚Äù I looked at him and said ‚ÄúGet the fuck out of my house! You think this is a fucking game? These sumbitches will rip your fucking heads off and eat your guts. They are dangerous monsters. You can‚Äôt call 911, and Animal Control will laugh in your face. If you want those beasts gone, then you have to pay the price.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOk, General, Ok. Simmer down‚Äù, he said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to get you upset. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to the boys and see what we can come up with. I‚Äôll give ya a call.‚Äù As he walked out the door I said ‚ÄúBy the way, I got a couple n!*#*rs on my crew. I trust that won‚Äôt be a problem.‚Äù Melvin just sort of crinkled his brow in disdain and walked off. I laughed to myself. 

A couple days later Melvin called me. He said he spoke to his KKK buddies and they want me to do the job. He said they were able to scrape up $5,000.00 and asked could I start with one Bigfoot. He reasoned that if I killed one, then the other one might ‚Äúget the message‚Äù and leave. This irritated me. 

I replied ‚ÄúGoddamnit, Melvin! Stop wasting my time! If I kill one, then chances are the other one will get pissed and try to kill me and my crew, dumbass!!! Taking on one Bigfoot means I am taking on all of the creatures there.‚Äù Melvin kind of stammered around, saying it would be tough for them to come up with the other 5 grand.

I asked him, ‚ÄúMelvin, let me ask you something, son. Are you fucking retarded? Because you are acting like you have shit for brains. I have already told you it is 10 grand to get me for this job, and not a fucking penny less!‚Äù   Then, just to tick off Melvin, I told him to stop acting like a ‚Äún!gg%r‚Äù and get the fucking money. Otherwise, stop bothering me. 

So, this past Friday was a week after Melvin‚Äôs phone call to me. And he is blowing up my phone again. I am thinking that either (1) he does not have the money and is wanting to make some kind of hillbilly deal, which would piss me off even further. Not wanting to get pissed off, I decided to just not answer his call. Or, (2) he had the ten grand. In the case of the latter I figured I would let him stew a bit. Besides, I had plenty of work lined up, and the thought of a couple bigfoots harassing those KKK f#ggots in sheets made me smile.

So, come Sunday morning, I sat down with a steaming cup of coffee and called Melvin. He answered after just two rings. I told him it was me. He got all excited, saying ‚ÄúGeneral!!! Damn it‚Äôs good to hear from ya!!! I been trying to git hold of ya all weekend!! Damn, but you is a hard man to get in touch with!‚Äù 

I asked why he has been calling me. He told me they were able to get the ten grand. ‚ÄúMe and momma had to take out a second mortgage on my lot and trailer, but I got all the money‚Äù, he said. 

Honestly, I was a little disappointed. I really did not want this job. My mind immediately started constructing excuses. Then Melvin got kind of quiet and said ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something else I got to tell ya, General. Me and the boys went out there the other night with our shotguns. We was gonna try and take care of them bastards ourselves.‚Äù

I interrupted Melvin. ‚ÄúYou dumb fuck!! You could have got yourself killed. More importantly, you probably just pissed them off!‚Äù, I said. Melvin was silent. I then asked, ‚ÄúHow many of your guys did the creatures get?‚Äù Another silence, followed by Melvin quietly saying ‚Äútwo‚Äù. 

I asked if they were dead. Melvin said ‚ÄúGeneral, them big Sasquatch dragged them men off in the woods .... then they .... {Melvin starts sobbing} they did ‚Äòthings‚Äô to them. Horrible things!‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúDid the men survive?‚ÄùOld Melvin said that ‚ÄúRoger‚Äù was in intensive care. They found him lying unconscious and naked in the woods then rushed him to the ER. He was rushed into surgery and had emergency anal reconstructive surgery. 

I asked ‚ÄúWhat about the other one?‚Äù Melvin sighed then said ‚ÄúBert. Poor Bert. We found his mangled corpse hanging from a tree. He was naked and covered in blood. His rectum was pulled inside out. We managed to get him out of the tree, then noticed he ain‚Äôt got his head on his body any more. They ripped his head off, General!!!!! THEY RIPPED OFF POOR BERT‚ÄôS HEAD JUST LIKE YOU SAID THEY WOULD, GENERAL!!!!! OH SWEET BABY JESUS!!!‚Äù 

At that point Melvin lost his shit and started crying hysterically. I hung up the phone and got another cup of coffee. A few minutes later Melvin called back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, General. I just lost it‚Äù, he said. I replied, ‚ÄúYeah, you did. Suck it up and try not to act like a total f#g, ok?‚Äù

I told Melvin to put the cash in a bag, bring it to my house, set it at my front door, ring my door twice, and leave. He asked if this was some sort of secret deal we can‚Äôt speak about. I told him no, that I just did not want to have to see him and talk to him again. 

I further instructed Melvin and his KKK friends to stay home and stay away from the property. I would call them once the job is done to settle up. Melvin asked ‚ÄúSo, once I drop off the money, when will you get started?‚Äù I told him if he got me the money within the next couple hours I would assemble my crew on the property that night. 

Forty-five minutes later my doorbell rang twice. I found a grocery bag at my front door filled with cash. I took it to my kitchen table and counted it. All there. I then contacted my crew, gave them the coordinates of the property and instructed them all to be there at 8:30 pm, locked and loaded. 
__________________________________________

I arrived at the property at 8:10 pm. I was surprised to find that I was not the first one there. The newest member of my crew was already there, decked out in full camo and armed to the teeth. I could not help but smile. 

You may remember from a prior story my good buddy, Boss N#gger. He is one bad motherfucker who runs a combination whore house - illegal cockfighting ring out in the back country. I did him a solid and put his nephew, Little N#gger, on my crew. 

Little N#gger beat me to the property. I got out of my truck and said ‚ÄúHello there, Little N#gger! You ready to go murder some fucking monsters?‚Äù He was ready to go. I inspected his rifle: an H&K AR-10. His sidearm was a Smith .460 revolver. His backup weapon - a fucking hatchet. I knew immediately that I liked this kid! 

Big Dick arrived next, at 8:15 pm. He had his son, Little Dick, with him. They both arrived with grins on their faces and guns in hand. Murder and Scum rode together and got there at 8:25 pm. Finally, N#gger Finger came rolling in, late as usual, at 8:37 pm. I asked him why he was late. ‚ÄúWell damn, General, I was nostrils deep in sum that old tangy pussy from the fried chicken joint in town, know what I mean?‚Äù, he said. I felt Like I was going to vomit. 

With everybody present, I started to address the crew for the pre-assault briefing. I started out, ‚ÄúLook, guys, there are most likely 2 very large and aggressive Bigfoot in these woods. They have been harassing people and acting territorial. Our plan is to set up a fake camp site where others have been accosted by these creatures with snipers on the perimeter. N#gger Finger, you and Little N#gger will be the bait. Scum, Murder, Big Dick, and Little Dick will be on the perimeter. I will be on patrol and serve as backup once we engage. Any questions?‚Äù

There were no questions. I told the boys assigned to the perimeter to go get into position. I then escorted the bait to their position. We made a campfire and erected a tent in order to create the fiction of a camp site. I gave N#gger Finger 2 pounds of bacon to cook on the fire so we could get some scent in the woods. 

Once the fake camp was set up, there was one more thing to do. I reached into my sack and pulled out a couple of white sheets with head holes cut out and KKK headwear I made before I left the house. I handed them to the boys and told them to put it on. ‚ÄúWhat da fuck is this shit?‚Äù, asked N#gger Finger. I said, ‚ÄúLook, dude, we need to put all our feelings aside and focus on the job. There are a couple of gnarly Sasquatch out here we need to terminate.‚Äù 

N#gger Finger continued, ‚ÄúYeah, but why the sheets? We supposed to look like ghosts er something. Why we gotta wear sheets?‚Äù I sighed, then came clean. I told them that the victims of these monsters were KKK and that they needed to look like KKK clowns in order to trick the beasts into thinking they were back. 

N#gger Finger got upset, saying ‚ÄúSheeyit! They ain‚Äôt no way I is gonna dress up like sum KKK cracker!‚Äù Sensing that Finger needed some more motivation, I got in his face and said ‚ÄúPUT ON THE FUCKING COSTUME NOW, YOU STUPID MOTHERFUCKER!!! THAT‚Äôs AN ORDER!!!‚Äù Old N#gger Finger shrunk back and said ‚ÄúOk, General, ok, you don‚Äôt have to get all upset. I‚Äôll put on this  cracker get-up. Damn!‚Äù I looked at Little N#gger  and asked if he had any problem putting on the sheets. He said, ‚ÄúHell no, Uncle General!!! I‚Äôm here to kill Bigfoots!!‚Äù I nodded in approval. ‚ÄúGood man‚Äù, I said.

1hhh0qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1hhh0qw/bancha_and_sencha_in_a_1980_cookbook/,bancha and sencha in a 1980 cookbook,"in 1980 the mini-series Shogun was released on HBO to much acclaim. Also in 1980 ‚ÄúJapanese Cook: A Simple Art: was released with very favorable reviews.

The evening that each episode was to air we‚Äôd get some friends together and do our best to cook a Japanese meal before the show. One time we even tried sushi! This was made easier by having a Japanese grocery store a few miles away. The drinks for the evening were bancha and warm sak√©.

For some reason I remembered the cookbook‚Äôs description of bancha and sencha, below:

>Bancha, so-called coarse green tea, is the lowest grade, but it is the tea that is consumed in the greatest quantities. In restaurants, bancha in handleless mugs (yunomi) is always served free of charge when patrons take their seats- something to sip while reading the menu- and fresh tea is poured once the meal is underway. In factory and in office, bancha is the beverage that employees drink at breaktime- there are even bancha vending machines. Bancha is also popular at home because of its economical price.

>For bancha for 4 to 5: Warm a large teapot with hot water, empty it and put about 3 rounded Tbsps of bancha leaves into the pot. Add about 3 cups freshly drawn boiling water. Let steep about 2 to 3 minutes, then pour into warmed mugs. Drain the pot to the last drop (if left to steep too long, the leaves make the tea bitter). Strain or not, as you like. Most Japanese teapots have an internal strainer at the base of the spout, but this varies in effectiveness. If more tea is required, you may use the leaves for a second batch. After that, discard soaked leaves and use fresh.

>Bancha is often described as coarse because it is made from larger, more mature leaves than any other tea, and leaves are cut to include even stems. The poorer the grade of bancha, the more dried stems and twigs in the tea. Coarse green tea is often roasted to heighten flavor. Such tea is known as h≈çjj-cha (literally ""roasted tea""), and the leaf is ebony brown. H≈çjj-cha-cha brews a tawny brown beverage with a deep smoky taste that is different from the yellowish, slightly astringent tea that plain bancha yields. H≈çjj-cha-cha is palatable when cold, but green bancha turns bitter when it cools.

>You can toast green bancha at home to make h≈çjj-cha. Place dry leaves in a dry, heavy-bottomed frying pan and toast over high heat till browned and aromatic, about 2-3 minutes for ¬Ω cup leaves. Shake the pan constantly to keep leaves from scorching. Another type of bancha is genmai-cha, or ""rice tea."" This sort of tea consists of bancha mixed with grains of roasted and popped rice. It is not difficult to recognize genmai-cha; the popped rice looks like miniature popcorn in a green bed of leaves. Genmai-cha is brewed exactly as bancha is. It has a slightly nutty flavor owing to the presence of the rice.

>Most bancha is good to drink with meals because it complements the taste of food (not so much attention has to be paid to the taste of this sort of tea itself. At the same time it refreshes the palate. Bancha is even drinkable alongside sak√©. It is customary to serve cups of both during long banquets.

>Sencha, literally ""infused tea,"" is good, medium-grade green tea. The leaves that go into sencha are tenderer and younger than those used for bancha. The leaf-picking has been done with greater care so that there are no stems or twigs. Naturally, sencha is more expensive and better than bancha; it is ""guest tea.

>Sencha is appreciated and is not drunk as a thirst-quencher like bancha. It is made and served in smaller quantities in special small pots (kyusu) ‚Äî and drunk from small handleless pottery or porcelain cups. Sencha is found as the complimentary drink only at exclusive restaurants with free-spending clientele (most likely sushi shops, because sencha tastes very good with raw fish dishes). In offices or factories or places of business, sencha is offered to visitors of note. In homes, it is often brewed to impress visiting relatives. There is also a sencha ritual, but it is not as celebrated as the powdered tea (matcha) ceremony.

>Sencha for 4 to 5: Warm a small teapot (kyusu) with hot water, empty it and put about 2 rounded tsps of sencha leaves into the pot. Pour in about 1 cup hot water that has been allowed to drop from the boiling point to about 175¬∞F (80¬∞C). (Remove water from the heat and allow to stand a bit to reach this lower temperature.) Let tea steep for 1 minute. First pour a little tea into each warmed cup, repeat this procedure again, then ""fill"" each cup. Do not fill cups brim full; the proper level is about ‚Öî cup. Drain the pot to the last drop. If more tea is required, you may use the leaves a second time.

When I retired and switched from coffee to black ""breakfast"" teas, and then Oolongs, and finally to Japanese green teas, my daily drinkers have always been sencha. It seems like somewhere in the last 40 years sencha has replaced bancha as the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù Japanese green tea- at least in the US. Is this also true in Japan?

Also, does anyone have any idea what a Japanese sencha ceremony is like? Like many people my personal sencha ritual has evolved over the years.",2,1734570426.0,tea,0,1.0,False

I live at home with my parents; one of which takes more care than most, and is being let down repeatedly by the NHS. Rent is very cheap, but I do pay half as I take up 2 rooms of the 3 bed house (essentially me and my business take up 1/2 of the household bills).

Social life is virtually non existent because of my working hours. Dating life is hugely frustrating; get a reasonable amount of attention / numbers due to working environments, but never leads to even a coffee date. A lot of poor excuses and even just complete ghosting. 

Also worth mentioning, my cat got shot with a BB gun recently in our back garden. Who does that and why?

1hhgufv,https://i.redd.it/z2wa1cgwep7e1.jpeg,Spilled some if my latte in the warming tray and shorted out the power [lelit mara x],"So after making my morning coffee I quite often place the full cup back onto the cup warmer to keep it warm longer if I can't sit and drink it all straight away (I have a 3 y o, so just sitting and drinking my coffee in peace is a rare luxury)

Yesterday as I was doing this I accidentally caught the bottom of the cup against the lip of the warming tray and sploshed a good amount of milky coffee into the warming tray. Suddenly the power to the whole house went out and it seems to have conpeltely fried the powerboard it was plugged into, safety switch wouldn't go back on until I unplugged the whole thing, not just the machine. I cleaned up any coffee I could see from the top, then opened it up to let it cool down and dry out. 

I'm not sure what to do next. Sometimes electrical things are fine again once they've had time to dry out? Should I try turning it on? I can see dried up coffee on top of the boiler, and I assume it dripped in amongst the wires you can see in the photo, but I can't see any obvious way of cleaning it without pulling everything apart.

First owner. 
Both are brand new and less than 2 weeks that I got them. I cut some grapes with the Nakagawa and I've cut nothing with the petty. 

Both came from cleancut.eu 

Disclaimer:
I did a light coffee patina on both but removed it on the Bunka. If I didn't tell you, you wouldn't be able to tell probably. 

I believe cleancut.eu is the only place you can get either of these right now. I paid $350 for the Bunka including shipping. Since it's brand new I'm asking $350 for it. 

Asking $120 for the petty even though I paid $150 for it including shipping. I have the box also but it's in storage.
