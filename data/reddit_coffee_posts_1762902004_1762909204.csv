1our605,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1our605,Bakit daw ako galit sabi ni seller?,"Ako ba talaga ang mali dito? Tell me if I am para matuto ako sa experience na to at di na maulit.

Loooong post. Sorry agad. Hehe.
Gusto ko lang detailed.

For context:
Nag scroll kasi ako sa fb, tapos nakita ko tong product na super na excite ako bilhin. Pangpapayat to na coffee, meron din syang pang boost ng milk. So ako, naisipan kong bumili since dalawa kami ng hubby ko na hindi makapag exercise at talagang lumaki at bumigat simula nung nag buntis ako. So decided na ko bumili.

Nag hanap ako sa mismong fb page ng CEO ng legit seller tapos linked sa shopee para dun mag check out. Habang nag scroll ako, naisipan kong tanungin ang ate kong sa Taguig nakatira. (Taga Taguig din ako pero di kami same house, pero currently nasa Cavite.) Kung gusto nya rin magpabili. Lagi kasi yun nagrereklamo sakin na puro fake nabibili nya kaya naisipan ko isabay. Umoo sya tas nag usap kami saglit ng bibilhin nya.

E di chineck out ko na. Binayaran ko thru CC. Tapos biglang tumawag ang ate na 'teka, mas gusto ko yung isa nyang product.' tas wait daw kasi i make sure nya muna kung yun gusto nya. So binaba nya ang call para mag check pa sa fb ni CEO.

So ako, since nagbago isip nya, kinancel ko agad yung order nya. Wala namang problema sa part namin kasi marerefund naman sa CC. 

Habang kinancel ko order nya, napansin ko yung address. Nakalimutan kong palitan during check out. (Naka save na yung different addresses namin since lagi naman sya nagpapabili, and since palipat lipat din kami ni hubby sa bahay sa Taguig at Cavite) so chineck ko rin yung order ko. Mali rin. Nakalagay din sa address sa Cavite. (Sa Silang Cavite naka address, sa bahay ng mom ko. Currently nasa Tanza Cavite kami.)

So kinancel ko agad. Tapos di na nagreply ang ate, dahil nasa work din. Baka biglang may ginawa, so di ko muna inistorbo. Tatawag naman yun if nakapili na. Tapos ako, nag focus ng magpatulog ng baby.

Nagulat ako, nung oorder na ko ulit ng 8pm, nag chat na si seller ng ganyan. Na para bang kasalanan kong 13mins difference ng pag cancel. Di ko naman imtention na masayangan sila ng mga bubble wrap. Pero 13mins nakapag prep na agad? Makikita naman agad nila of cancelled yun eh. Bakit sulinukbat pa na busy sya at may other businesses? Nag seller din ako sa shopee before, kailangan muna nila pindutin na i prep na nila yung orders ko para maging 'to ship' tapos di na makaka cancel yun or sa mismong shopee app na pwede icancel, tas need ng approval ni seller.

Pero ganung kabilis na 13mins, na gaslight pa ko. Dko rin naman gustong i cancel. E kaso wala namang tao ngayon dun sa address na nakalagay, sa February pa ulit kami uuwi dun. Di naman namin close ang kapitbahay. Wala kaming machachat na mag received or something.

Sa iba na lang tuloy ako bumili. Mas naparami pa nga binili namin eh compare sa na cancel namin. Kung di sya nag ate chona at naghintay na lang, edi sana mas kumita sila.",1,1762908956.0,ShopeePH,0,1.0,False

Hey! First time posting, but I've been apart of the community for awhile. There is this guy, lets call him Drake (I am pretty sure he has reddit). He, 24M, and me, 21F, had previously known one another. I worked at a coffee shop, and he came in 5 days a week, same time, and stayed for about the same amount of time. I really didn't notice him at work at first, because truthfully I tended to make my money and go ahead and go home. However, a coworker pointed him out to me, and he and I had conversation every time he came in. Although, at the time, I had a boyfriend, so I would mention my boyfriend from time to time. Of course, the first time he looked a bit disappointed from what I remember. I worked a ton, and he always ordered the same thing. We bonded over our equation tattoos, I have one and he has a TON. Random tidbit.

Flash forward to now. I moved to a different city, at a different university, and overall I am a different woman from who I was before, which has been great! I am also single. I was scrolling on a dating app (sad, I know. But you really can't meet people nowadays, covid really killed it), and I found his profile. I didn't recognize him until I saw something that jogged my memory- The tattoos. He came to hangout in my city, unfortunately fortunately, we had s\*\*. I only say unfortunately, because I really am tired of being the girl who people call for that. Anyways, we hung out all weekend, made jokes, talked, and honestly really hit it off. He took me to breakfast and even drove down from his city, twice, which is about 45 minutes each way. Drake mentioned he was shocked but super excited to meet me again, and how he always thought I was super funny/cool. He would text me when he got home from us hanging out, and would kiss me goodbye. We don't txt a whole lot, because I'm only really on my phone at night, and go to bed early. We are trying to meet up next week. I asked him what he was looking for, and he mentioned he does have commitment issues, yet he literally remembered every single interaction we ever had, even my hair color changing since then. We have similar interests, and similar career paths, however he his already settled into his.

I really don't care about his money or status, but he honestly is a really fun guy to be around. I definitely felt some type of spark, which I havent felt in well over a year, even with me re-entering the dating scene. So I guess my question is.. Do I continue seeing him, even though I really like him, or do I stop, because I'm afraid I'll get hurt again? I am not sure where life may take me, and I am also military on top of being in university. I'm not sure where to go with this, even though I really like him.

1our23l,https://www.reddit.com/r/moviecritic/comments/1our23l/spoilerfilled_superman_review/,Spoiler-filled Superman Review,"I wrote this on my phone just after seeing the newest Superman movie because I had to put what I was feeling down to try to understand why I hated this movie so, so much when so many people loved it. I waited until now to post it partly to avoid spoiling it for anyone and also partly because I forgot I wrote it.

It's full of spoilers and some colorful language. You'll probably disagree with me. That's fine.

Let's go through this movie scene by scene to look at what makes it one of the worst superhero movies in recent memory.

- In the beginning, Superman has attacked and mildly tortured a foreign leader off-screen to convince him not to invade a defenseless neighboring country. People are mad at him about this, though it is not explained why, except that maybe nobody is actually mad at him and it is merely Lex's army of monkeys with keyboards making it seem like people are mad online. Yet people should probably be mad because Superman did, in fact, attack and mildly torture a world leader, and that probably shouldn't be allowed?

- Superman has been beat up off-screen by a super soldier from that aggressive country - why did this super soldier not protect the leader from Superman in the first place? Unclear. If we had been shown this event, the reason could have been shown to us.

- Superman is so beat up that he cannot move. I did not realize this was possible. He calls on his very bad dog Krypto to drag him to the Fortress of Solitude, which is difficult because Krypto does not understand English very well, and despite the Fortress having hordes of robots whose entire existence is to serve Superman.

- In the Fortress, one robot is ""new"". This is used as justification for unabashed exposition while the other robots explain who Superman is, where he is from, who his parents are, why he is on Earth, how the sun heals him, and what their own purpose is. This despite the fact that robots would undoubtedly be built knowing this information.

- Superman is healed and returns to the fight against the super soldier with no new strategy. He gets his ass kicked again, putting up 0% of a fight. We see this is because Lex controls the super soldier and is soooo smart that he can anticipate Superman's moves with immaculate precision - however, despite being clearly shown this, we are also bluntly told by his team, again using the excuse of someone being ""new"" and apparently having missed all of the onboarding training to explain what she's been hired to work on.

- Lex' ability to command the super soldier is only possible through the use of a dozen or so drone cameras that fly around the fight, giving him visibility. Superman somehow never sees these drones or guesses their purpose. Lex has no backup plan if they are destroyed, so if Superman had caught on to them, Lex' entire plan, costing him tens of billions of dollars to setup, would have been dead before it began.

- After Superman loses again, we simply cut to the next day in the Daily Planet. That's right - there were no stakes in that fight and the super soldier just wanted to give Superman a public beatdown. Given his incredible domination over Superman, probably could have killed him. Despite that being Lex' entire stated goal later in the film, this is not even attempted because, you know, then there wouldn't be a movie. 

- At the Daily Planet, Clark claims he interviewed Superman just after the fight. Apparently this is not his first exclusive interview with the world's greatest superhero, who this time has just lost his first fight! Big news! Nobody seems to care. As an aside, there is a woman who works in the Daily Planet whose name I did not catch but her entire purpose, in several scenes, is to wear a skin-tight, low-cut dress with half of her fake tits visible...at work.

- Clark beats Lois home and is making dinner when she arrives. Their exposition-only dialogue informs us that they have been dating for 3 months and she knows he is Superman. He gives her an exclusive interview as Superman, in which she grills him over the whole political situation that he got himself involved in (again, in the kind of dialogue that serves to tell the audience what happened, despite the two people having the conversation being fully aware of everything being explained), and arguing that he was in the wrong not because he attacked, tortured, and threatened a world leader, but because despite clear evidence that the aggressor country was going to violently overthrow their third-world neighbor (this is very clearly Israel/Palestine coded, but without Hamas, so ""Palestine"" is truly just a defenseless minority being conquered by a technologically-dominant aggressor), Superman couldnt ""know for sure"" that people would have died or that life under the aggressor's regime would be worse. Weird take.

- Lex finds the Fortress of Solitude and accesses it easily - it emerges from its hiding place underground as he and his team (which includes that masked super soldier that can beat Superman) approach it, despite exposition-only dialogue (you sensing a theme yet?) being told to us that it will only rise for Superman himself. The door unlocks for them. The robots think Superman has returned. At this point, if you haven't guessed that Lex' masked super soldier is a Superman clone (or possibly just another Kryptonian), you have not been paying an ounce of attention. However, this will be saved for a huuuuge reveal near the finale.

- Lex destroys the robots. A member of his team hacks the message thet Superman's parents sent him to Earth with. Superman has always believed that this message was damaged in the crash and has only ever heard the first half. Lex fixes the second half in mere seconds, which seems strange given that Superman again has had an entire team of robots from a far more technologically advanced civilization, familiar with the technology, try to do this for 30 years and been unable to. Conveniently, the second half of the message from Jor-El explains that Superman's mission is to enslave Earth and repopulate it with human/Kryptonian hybrids so that Krypton can live on. If this sounds exactly like the plot of the successful tv show Invincible, you're exactly right. Lex could not have expected to find this and yet it is exactly what he needed.

- Superman struggles to fight a massive kaiju, spending most of his time bonking it on the nose and trying to prevent it from damaging the city. The Justice Gang show up (Green Lantern, Mr Terrific, and Hawk Girl - the latter of which actually screeches like a hawk more than she speaks like a human throughout the movie, despite not actually being hawk-like at all except being able to fly with inorganic wings). A quick convo with Superman reveals that he has exactly zero plan for solving the kaiju problem. Mr Terrific handles it immediately, killing the kaiju as easily as pouring himself a cup of coffee. Superman might be the strongest ""metahuman"" but so far, we have seen him do nothing but fail.

- Lex reveals to the world that Superman was sent to enslave them. The world immediately turns on Superman. He is distraught. He thinks maybe the video has been doctored...because of course it could be. What an easy thing that would be to do. And yet, Mr Terrific says no, Lex wouldnt doctor something like that...and so that entire idea is tossed right out. It is cold hard fact and everyone knows it, including Superman. No further questions asked...despite foul play being the most obvious possibility.

- Of course, we know the video is actually real because we saw Lex find it (oh the power of being SHOWN things instead of TOLD them - wonder if anyone has ever written a million books about writing that suggest doing more of the former and less of the latter... If so, Gunn has not read them). Superman was truly sent to enslave the world. He turns himself in to the government. They turn him over to Lex, who owns the government's military contracts. Lex puts Superman in a cell in a pocket dimension (get used to hearing about pocket dimensions - the characters will literally not shut up about it for the rest of the film. It is simply a cgi-heavy void that recalls Quantumania - hated when Marvel did it, loved here.) Lex has many of his enemies locked away here, including ex-girlfriends, and handily, a bizarre metahuman who can transform any part of his body into any kind of matter, including kryptonite. Yes, this is how Lex plans to imprison Superman for the forseeable future - by locking him in a cage with a man whose hand is made of kryptonite. That man does what Lex says because Lex has his newborn son in a cage just across the way, and the implication is that bad things will happen to the baby if Metamorpho doesn't keep Superman in check.

- If you had to guess how Superman might escape this prison after Lex does the dumb movie villain thing and leaves, might you guess that he would explain to Metamorpho that if he just stops poisoning Superman with kryptonite, Superman could break them all out of there and save his son? Because that was my first guess and boy was I right.

- During the escape fight against Lex' goons (who I believe are humans in sci-fi armor, and who die en masse several times in this film, including in this prison break, and often at Superman's hands, calling into question what happened to Superman's whole ""don't kill"" thing), there is a stunningly cringy example of why the writing in this movie sucks. Metamorpho is surrounded by four bad guys. He begins to turn into what is clearly bubbling acid. The bad guys joke ""what are you going to do, splash us?"" And Metamorpho actually says ""yes, with hydronucleic acid"" before he does, in fact, splash them and they die their acidy deaths. The movie did everything it could to SHOW and yet still could not help but TELL the audience what was happening in the most 5th-grade-boy-thinks-this-is-cool way possible.

- Superman escapes. Oh, and Mr Terrific and Lois are there too. They came to save him. They didnt have to. He saved himself. They literally dont do anything except maybe show him the gateway out of the pocket dimension. They just needed something to do, so this is what the Director's Hand had them do.

- Superman has Kryptonite poisoning. This means he cant possibly fight Lex for a day or two. He goes to the family farm in Kansas, where Pa Kent reminds him that he is who he is because of the way he was raised and his 30 years on Earth, not because of what his biological parents whom he never met said in a video they made before they yeeted him into space. This is sold as an epiphany for Superman, rather than the most obvious thing in the world. He does not HAVE to enslave humanity if he doesnt want to!

- In Superman's absence, the Israel stand-in has begun its invasion of Palestine. The poor defenseless Palestinians cry out for Superman to save them. It is supposed to be a hopeful, inspiring chant. It does not feel earned. Which is all for the best because they will not be saved by Superman anyway - he is resting in Kansas. Instead, he will call on the Justice Gang to go save them. For some reason, this was not a possibility anybody saw coming and neither Israel nor Lex (who has of course been supporting them) has a backup plan. Green Lantern single-handedly wipes out the invasion with a flick of his wrist. What did we need Superman for again? The guy who, again, has not won a single battle yet (unless you count the prison escape which he actually only survives thanks to Krypto, who saves him many times in this movie)?

- Lex creates another pocket dimension (remember those?) and tears it open so that it begins swallowing the entire Earth, starting with Metropolis. This rent in the Earth moves veryyyy quickly...until Superman shows up, because he then has a lot of fighting to do and if it continued that quickly, the Earth would be loooong destroyed. So it inexplicably seems to grind to a halt offscreen so the protagonist can do what he needs to do.

- Superman gets beat up by Lex commanding his super soldier again, and then they pour nanites into his lungs and eyes so he cant breath. Lex thinks this will kill him. Superman desperately flies straight up into space. For some reason, the super soldier cannot stop him from doing this, despite having identical powers (remember, you do not know this is a superman clone yet, just a random masked man with super strength, flight, and laser beam eyes who can beat the shit out of Superman). Instead, to try to stop him, they fully surround him in nanites. It is unclear why this would stop Superman from being able to fly, as the source of his flying power does not seem to come from anything external - its not like he's out here flapping wings. He plummets to Earth, at which point Lex is good enough to explain to us what is happening - Superman actually KNEW that flying up into space would make them cover him in nanites, which would protect him when he flew as hard as he could into the ground, holding on to the unprotected super soldier! If this seems unbelievable to you, almost as if the writers themselves could not figure out a way for Superman to survive having his lungs filled with nanites, you're not alone.

- Crashing into the Earth kills the engineer who controls the nanites and therefore the nanites themselves also die (is this how nanotechnology works? Is the billionaire Lex Luthor out here making nanites that are somehow inextricably linked to a living biological source to function?) Superman is fine now. However, so is the super soldier, except for his mask. Oh no! It looks just like Superman! Good thing we have Lex on a radio to exposition dump his whole plan about cloning Superman, including a startlingly vulnerable admission of jealousy being the driving factor for alllll his hatred towards Superman. Seriously, this is actually a pretty great justification for Lex' evil behavior - a better movie would have shown us that jealousy with subtlety and emotional gravitas, but unfortunately this movie just has Lex shout (in a room full of his direct reports) about how jealous he is of all the big strong men that everyone loves. Sigh. Oh, what could have been.

- Superman must fight his clone. Despite this clone being a person, very much like Superman himself, there has somehow been no backlash against Gunn for the way this battle ends in Superman (having finally realized what the drones are for and asking Krypto to destroy them) sending his (living, breathing) clone into a black hole (for some reason, pocket dimensions have these. You'll learn allllll about pocket dimensions, believe me) and quite certainly to his death. This is literally the first and only fight that Superman truly wins in this film and he does it by killing his human opponent. Remember when Superman killed the big bad in a previous film and everyone hated it? I guess as long as he doesnt snap the guy's neck and the death happens where we dont really see it, its ok? Or maybe clones aren't real people? There's a moral dilemma I bet our children's children will have to wrestle with. Anyway, immediately after killing his clone, Superman also ascends into the air and spins like the ship at the end of Last Starfighter, lasering through all of Lex' other soldiers (who again sure seem like human people and who are sure dead now). Hawk Girl kills the leader of Israel, dropping him a hundred feet, saying its because ""she isnt like Superman"" but from what we've just seen, maybe they're not so different.

- Superman confronts Lex. Mr Terrific stops the pocket dimension from expanding in two seconds from Lex' control tower (he is a true badass metahuman himself, having wrecked a bunch of soldiers on a beach before the prison break, and yet somehow needed to wait for Superman to show up to try to storm Lex' completely unprotected control tower to solve the whole pocket dimension black hole swallowing Earth thing). 

-In a side story, Lois and the folks at the Daily Planet discover Lex' entire plot with just the tiniest bit of effort (literally, 80% of how they know any of this is explained away as just ""sources are telling us..."" And the other 20% is because Lex' tall, supermodel girlfriend is OBSESSED with short, plain, and straight-up-rude-to-her Jimmy Olson and sends him pictures of what he needs to expose Lex) so Lex is arrested (important note that Superman had nothing to do with this arrest so again, Superman doesn't even win the battle against his nemesis - very basic journalism does) and yay, the world is saved.

- The final judgment: this is truly a comic book turned into a movie. The dialogue is corny as fuck, and I would estimate that easily more than half of it is exposition that serves only to explain what is happening to the audience. The story is nonsense. There are no arcs - nobody emerges changed or learns anything, except maybe Superman learning that its ok to not be a super-powered fascist just because the parents you never met said you should be. It is all visual. It is all plot. It is all spectacle. It is profoundly boring. It is everything that is wrong with superhero movies, and big blockbuster action movies in general. It relentlessly insults the viewer's intelligence. And yet it is wildly succesful, because it asks nothing of you. Thunderbolts, on the other hand, did far less at the box office despite being a film about depression, loneliness, and finding meaning in an inherently meaningless world, that just happened to include some shooting and fighting sometimes. Superman is the Avatar of superhero movies - all CGI and ""cool ideas"" but zero meaning or importance or art.

1our17o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1our17o/4_years_gone/,4 years gone,"my bf and i broke up after 4 years at 1am on Saturday. this came out of the blue truthfully as we were fine. a week ago was our last normal day. i made dinner per usual, we watched DWTS as usual. we laughed, smiled, had our normal night. next day, work was very stressful as I had my corporate visit at work so hardly any texts were sent. i came home that night (10 hour shift) with a cold. he came home late and i was basically falling asleep. next morning, i was off work and sick. things felt normal, he went and got me coffee, brought me home medicine that night but then it turned weird. he wasn’t as touchy, lovey, whatever. he told me his dad was sick and he needed to go home? i was confused and a bit upset bc im also sick yk? but of course family first. he went home and our texts weren’t much, and he didn’t call me like he said. he came back the next day, he came back to check on me, we talked like normal, he went to work. he came home halfway through the day to bring me something then came home to change before going out for his friends bday. the whole day, vibes are off, i’m starting to sense something’s wrong. i’m texting him, i’m asking what’s wrong. what’s going on. are we okay. my gut is telling me to panic. he came home at 12:30am after the outing. i stayed up because my body was in a panic and i needed that reassurance. he got in bed still not touchy, no cuddling, no nothing. i was upset but maybe he was just tired. his phone kept buzzing, it was vibrating the bed. i grabbed his phone to check who was texting and it opened to his friend asking him ab the game. then i look at the previous message (didn’t have to scroll) and i see him telling his friend he’s planning to break up with me. i immediately woke him up. i needed answers. he is waking up talking calmly basically saying he loves me but is not in love with me anymore. i’m in shock. i’m trying to keep him there, trying to figure it out, trying to make him stay. he leaves. i couldn’t believe it. the only person i’ve known for the last 4 years was gone. i slept 3 hours. i had to go to work, im sobbing at work, i can’t stop and im the manager. i felt so bad, i called my boss sobbing. he told me to go home. as i’m at work waiting to leave, i get a text from my brother that he’s back at our apartment packing him things with his dad and friends. i couldn’t believe it. this was it. i couldn’t go home now. i went and met up with my friend. after i went home, my closet bare, things are missing, spaces are empty. my heart is broken. he texts me. asked me to meet him downstairs in the common area to talk. i agreed because again i am so confused what went wrong in 3 days. what did i do. he explained after some thought he didn’t see us being tigether in 10 years. we weren’t compatible. he wanted more in a partner and it wasn’t me. it destroyed me but when i went downstairs i had no intentions of convincing him to stay. he made his choice, his parents knew. this felt like it. the conversation was mature, no fighting, calm. we both cried a lot. we hugged. we kissed. we said i love you. i watched him walk away. and now im miserable. i haven’t eaten a full meal since last week (getting sick curbed my appetite). i dont feel hungry, i finally slept through the night last night but the tv HAS to be on 24/7. the silence is so loud. i’m going back to work on thursday and i start therapy tomorrow. i’ve been journaling a lot, crying a lot, music a lot. my friends are my biggest support system right now but please someone tell me it gets better. or tell me he will come back. i love him so much and i can’t imagine him with anyone else. i want only him. i’m scared because my last breakup RUINED me. i was vaping (5 years sober now), lost 15 lbs, was in therapy, so emotionally unstable, i even quit my job for a period of time to rot. AND THAT RELATIONSHIP WAS ONLY 1 YEAR. how am i supposed to forget the person who i’ve known since i was 19 (24 now). i am losing it. sometimes dying sounds better than to feel the way i am.

Not to suck my own dick, but I'm a fairly successful guy I think. I have a lot of great friends that I enjoy spending time with; I have a great family too! I'm getting my PharmD, lots of scholarships, awards etc... but it all feels so meaningless? I know I'm very lucky to be so blessed, but it's not what I really want. I want to have someone special to share it with. 

I know it's my fault. When I'm at the clubs or at work, women of all ages tell me that I have a beautiful smile or that they really enjoyed talking to me, but I never act on it. I never follow up to ask to meet for coffee or whatever else. 

When it comes time to make my move, I always fuck it up. I always end up friendzoning myself and it really frustrates me afterwards! 

Even when a woman has outright asked me on a date, my dumbass has screwed it up because I didn't put my best foot forward. Once it goes beyond that initial superficial level of ""hey, I think you're attractive!"", I panic and throw myself under the bus. 

This sounds super dumb, but I'm too scared to open myself up emotionally to another person. I know I need to if I want to find a partner, but I've been scarred by it in the past and I don't want someone spilling my secrets again.

1ouqzd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ankylosingspondylitis/comments/1ouqzd2/i_uglycried_in_a_walgreens_parking_lot_and/,I ugly-cried in a Walgreens parking lot and finally admitted I needed help managing the mental load of AS,"Three weeks ago, I had a full meltdown in my car because the pharmacy tech asked if I wanted to wait for my Humira or come back later. Such a simple question. But in that moment, I couldn't decide. My spine was screaming, I hadn't slept more than 3 hours in days, and I was just... done.

I'd been holding it together for months (upon months), managing injections, doing my stretches even when they hurt like hell, explaining to my boss why I needed *another* day off after a bad night, pretending to be fine at family dinners while my SI joints felt like they were full of broken glass. But that day, something snapped. I sat in that parking lot for 45 minutes, crying, because I realized: the AS itself isn't even the hardest part anymore. It's the *loneliness* of it.

Nobody in my life really gets it. When I say ""I can't sit through a movie,"" they think I'm being difficult. When I try to explain morning stiffness, I watch their eyes glaze over. My brother told me last month, ""At least it's not cancer!"" and I wanted to scream. Yeah, I'm not dying. But I'm also 32 and feel like I'm 80 every morning. I'm watching my life shrink while everyone tells me I ""don't look sick.""

Here's what I've been doing that's actually helped:

1. Tracking my ""before flare"" patterns: I started noticing I'd get irritable or weirdly anxious 24-48 hours before a bad flare. Now when I feel that way, I clear my schedule early instead of pushing through and making it worse.

2. The ""3-person rule""...now I only explain my condition in detail to three people max. Everyone else gets ""I have a chronic condition that causes pain and fatigue."" Saves so much energy.

3. Talking to Juno when I'm spiraling: A friend with pots told me about this health companion app that's trained on chronic illness experiences. I use it like... a emotional dump at 2am when I can't sleep, or before doctor appointments when I need to sort out what I actually want to say. It doesn't try to fix me or give me the ""have you tried yoga?"" speech. It just listens and responds like it understands what living like this actually feels like.

4. Keeping a ""good moments"" note in my phone – On hard days, I read it. Things like ""September 14 - made it to coffee with Sarah"" or ""October 2 - didn't cry during the rheumatologist appointment."" Sounds small, but it reminds me I'm not ALWAYS drowning.

5. Letting myself be angry! i used to feel guilty for being mad about being sick. Now? I let myself rage about it. It's not fair. It sucks. And pretending it doesn't just makes me feel crazier.

The Walgreens parking lot cry was actually a turning point. I stopped trying to white-knuckle through everything alone. I'm not ""better"", I still have weeks where I barely leave the couch. But I'm less... shattered by it, I guess?

1ouqyee,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_YMBM2/comments/1ouqyee/getting_desperate_for_money/,Getting Desperate for Money 💰🎄😕,"Getting reeeeeally fed up now over having no money.
I am living with my husband who I love dearly and my 5 year old girl. My husband basically burned out at work and has been on illness benefit for over 1 year now. He worked his ass off in a job he hated, to support our little family.

I have an invisible disability but started work a few hours per week, even though it kills me but I try to pretend it’s not that bad. I get about 85 euro per week from that and social welfare. I’m waiting to be seen by a neurologist at the moment too.. 

I had to pay over €4000 this year on medical expenses. Our rent is €1500 per month which is decent with the market that’s there but it’s absolutely crippling for us.

We have nothing. No savings, burned through the small bit that we had.

I’m worried about Christmas 😣Feel very uneasy and beginning to feel a bit desperate for money now. It’s down to the nitty grittys. Wondering where we will get money for everything. It is all a big discussion and puzzle to sort out eg.buying a Christmas tree.

I have done SO well getting to where we are at and coping. Especially considering I love everything. I love coffee and candles and perfume and mugs and nice things. I dream of nice things. I dream of being able to walk into a shop and just buy an item. I need new socks. I need new runners. I need to see a dentist because I need at least 2 fillings. I’d like to buy matching Christmas Pjs for my son and I..

I know TONNES of people are in the same boat but I don’t know anyone like us right now and it’s crazy…like crazy because nobody would know we have no money!! Literally living from week to week and no spare money for little luxuries like coffee out or lunch out. Life feels soo limited..
Having no money takes the good out of EVERYTHING.

ANYWAY. I just needed to vent I guess.
Is there any way I can make money in time for Christmas?
I do mystery shops when I can too,even though the money is terrible for the hours you work..my partner tries to get the mystery shops too.. He is hoping to be back working hopefully in January but I have a feeling it could be longer (it’s not his fault, he’s tries SO hard every day).

Also, I guess I’m lucky that we once had a normal middle class life for awhile…so the material items we have like nice mugs or toys for our child are still here. But slowly the material things are wearing down and aren’t being replaced.. All my kids jumpers are too small for him.

I sound so whiney and maybe it’s because we were once more fortunate and I was more spoiled and took that for granted🤷‍♀️ But it’s getting really hard now…

Is anyone is a similar position?

1ouqwh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ouqwh3/aita_for_refusing_to_do_morning_child_routine_and/,AITA for refusing to do morning child routine and making hubby do it?,"Married with two children (10 & 7) plus a dog and 2 cats. Husband and I both have stressful, upper management jobs. My husband works four 10 hour shifts, Mon through Thurs; he leaves at 8am and returns usually 6 to 6:15pm. I work a hybrid job, some days at home and some days travelling, Monday through Friday 8-4.

My husband doesn't not get home before kids have supper and Tues and Thurs they both have sports that require me to take them/arrange drives before 6.

Currently, I get up (shower at night),get kids up, take dog out (sometimes hubby does this) make breakfast for kids, make sure youngest gets dressed and eats ( easily distracted and need to bug him every 5 mins to eat), make lunches, feed dog, ensure kids brush teeth, pack schoolbags, and drop to school. Daughter has ADHD and is awful to deal with until her meds kick in. I do not eat or have coffee until after dropoff but I do make my hubby's coffee (he has set up in Kherig, I just press the button).

After drop off, I work until 4:30pm; when I am working from home, kids arrive around 3:10pm and I have to snack and referee them. When I travel, my mom helps and they go to the neighbours.

I make supper, empty their lunch cans, clean kitchen, do hand dishes,load/unload the dishwasher, get homework done , take to activities and make sure there is something for supper for my husband.

My hubby's morning routine is: get up, sometimes let dog out, shower, shave, get dressed, eat breakfast, sometimes help keep son on track, feed cats/change water, pack up and leave. When I am away, he will do my regular routine.

I generally ensure kids get showered and my hubby mostly handles tuck in for the younger child.

Mornings are hard, kids are grumpy and I am exhausted afterwards. I am also super tired at the end of the day, no energy to do anything fun other than watch tv. My hubby gets frustrated that we don't do anything else together.

I think the fair arrangement would be that hubby takes care of mornings Monday through Thursday and I continue to do afternoon/supper/activity dropoff. I will still do school drop off and I can use this time to walk dog, exercise, have a shower, etc.

Fridays, when hubby is off, I would do morning routine and he can take over the afterschool and supper routine. There are no activities on Fridays.

I have suggested something like this to my husband but he gets mad and is not receptive. He doesn't think it is fair. AITA for making this happen.

Note: we both do other chores in home and outside but I am focusing on the ""parenting"": responsibilities only. What needs to be done for children and only during the school week. Also, when I have to be away for a few days, I am the one that ensures drives are found for activities, that someone can help afterschool, etc.",2,1762908246.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1ouqv7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ouqv7t/i_shook_a_mans_hand_and_now_i_cant_leave_my/,I shook a man's hand and now I can't leave my apartment,"It started a couple of days ago, with a fever. It was my final day off before I had to head back to work at a finance firm, and I had spent most of it lounging around, only leaving the house to pick up some groceries so I wouldn't have to do so after an exhausting day back.

When I was in the deli aisle, picking up some cheese for some tacos I was planning on making, a man walked up to me. He seemed dirty, in an oversized cargo jacket and worn-out jeans. His hair was tangled and greasy, but as he walked, I couldn't explain it fully, but his gait just didn't match him at all. He walked tall and straight, confident with a wide, toothy smile.

""Hello, sir, may I have a moment of your time?"" He asked, cool and clear as he outstretched a hand covered in a fingerless glove that looked like it hadn't been washed in decades. Just wanting him to go away, I took his hand and shook it, the cold sweat that was soaking his exposed skin seeping into my own dry palm.

""Hey, thanks, but I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. And I don't have any change.""

The man nodded politely, still smiling.

""Fair enough, sir, have a good day.""

He plodded off, and I watched as he approached a few others in the aisle, outstretching his hand but getting no takers other than me. I pulled out some Germex and rubbed it on my hands, hoping it wasn't some perv trying to spread a disease or his freshly rubbed dick stink.

The rest of the day was average, a little bit of gaming, keeping up with a couple of friends, but as it got closer to nightfall, my head started to throb. At first, I thought it was maybe allergies, or I hadn't been drinking enough water.

But by the time the sun went down, my head was screaming, like there was a nail being slowly driven deeper and deeper into my brain. No amount of Tylenol or Ibuprofen could even dampen it. But every time I checked my temp, it kept reading a nice lean 78 degrees.

I decided to try to get to sleep and, if in the morning it was still bad, I would call in from work and go to a walk-in clinic.

After an hour tossing and turning, I finally managed to pass out, only to wake up at 3:30 AM, with my head still absolutely screaming. I texted my boss, whom I thanked god I was on good terms with, that I wasn't gonna make it to the office today. Surprisingly, getting back to sleep was much easier than getting into it, and I slept wonderfully.

My eyes opened to a similar scene outside my bedroom window to what I had woken up to: a dark city at night, fluorescent lights making an artificial day. I yawned, feeling tired. Stretching, my body felt far more exhausted than my sleep should've left me; my shoulders ached with previous effort.

I checked my phone: 8:55 PM. 'Fuck, did I sleep through the entire day?' I thought, thankful that I was at least free from my headache. I realized there was no point in going back to sleep, so I just went through the motions of the day inside my apartment.

As I got up and went about my routine, I noticed my wallet was in a different spot than I remembered. I usually leave it on the kitchen table so I can grab it on my way out, but this time, it was on the counter where I usually drop it off after I get home. Odd, but not abnormal. 'Maybe I just put it there and forgot,' I thought.

Then, I saw my laundry room, the dryer rumbling as it squeezed all of the liquid out of my clothes. There was only one problem: I hadn't even put anything in the washer, let alone the dryer. I felt a tingle on the back of my neck, like someone was watching me notice oddities around my house. Instinctively, I checked around my ceiling, paranoia telling me there were now cameras in my home. I was only slightly relieved to discover a lack of anyone spying on me, but the feeling persisted.

I tried to come up with an excuse for the dryer as I stumbled into the kitchen, my head starting to hurt again. Opening the fridge just unhinged my reality a little further, as I saw a hamburger, still in its fast-food paper wrapping. 'Now, I KNOW that wasn't there before.' I thought, 'Had someone dropped by and gotten my laundry done and given me a burger? John, or maybe Chelsie? But they shouldn't have keys...' My thought trailed off as I heard a ding from my bedroom.

Walking back in, I found my phone in a pair of work pants, discarded on the side of the bed opposite the one I slept in. Pulling it out, a sense of dread slowly crept up my legs to fill my gut as I read a text I just received from 'Gigi from Work.'

""Thx for the help today!""

Weird. I checked the chat further and saw a text from 12:36 PM.

""Hey, you know anything about this new notice?"" Read, and apparently, responded to.

The pit in my stomach grew into an immense chasm, nearly making me nauseous as I saw a text, apparently, sent by me.

""Yeah, I'll come over and let ya know. Too much to explain over texts.""

'What the fuck?' I thought. I hadn't gone anywhere all day. A growing, nagging voice began to chant in my mind, like a whisper, ""Something is wrong, something is wrong.""

The angles of my apartment felt wrong, like my home had been silently and suddenly turned into someone else's. The knife rack was empty, and seemingly, every sharp object in my apartment was gone. My screwdriver, toothpicks, tweezers, and anything that could be sharp or sharpened were gone.

I started storming around my apartment in a frenzied panic, wondering if someone had broken into my home, sent a text from my phone, left a burger in the fridge, and turned my laundry on to avoid raising suspicion. But that wouldn't make any sense, maybe if they had killed me, but I was still very much alive. And besides, why do all of that just to murder me? Offset the time of death?

Then, another thought hit me. The voice in the back of my mind whispered like a corrupted advisor, 'But if they're still inside, taking all the weapons, making everything seem normal, well...'

I grabbed the closest thing to a weapon I had, the metal bar of my coat rack, and went room by room, ensuring that I was completely alone in my house. This, rather than ease my nerves, only added to the sense of unreality that was creeping into my mind, slinking in like a snake into a burrow.

What was 'I' doing while I was asleep? There was no way I was so sick that I pushed through the day, and then collapsed back at home after grabbing fast food and starting my laundry, and somehow completely forgot about it. Looking down at myself in horror, I realized I had even changed clothes, only now noticing the white button-up I usually wear to the office, instead of the plain t-shirt I had fallen asleep in.

I reached to open the phone, trying to put in my passcode as genuine panic began to climb up my throat. I needed to get someone, anyone, to confirm what happened, to reassure me that I hadn't forgotten about an entire day. My fingers moved instinctually, and...

Incorrect Passcode.

""What?"" I said aloud, being a little shocked at the hoarseness of my own voice. Had I been talking a lot? In my sleep? AND changed my fucking passcode? My heart began to beat rapidly, my mind racing for any other possible codes, any time I changed it. I tried until it locked me out.

In a near state of panic, I rushed for the front door, desperate just to get out, talk to someone, reestablish any sense of normality. Bar still in hand, I reached for the door handle to finally escape, only for the most painful sensation of pins and needles to strike my hand limp. My fingers barely grazed over the handle as I jerked my arm away, my hand apparently fallen asleep as it stung my nerves with waves of agony. I let out a yelp, like a dog with a shock collar.

I backed away from the door like it was an electric fence, shaking my limp hand until I could contract my fingers. My blood was pumping, my fight or flight sending my entire nervous system on high alert. Mentally, I began checking myself: my breathing, my sight, all of my organs sitting inside fluid-filled sacs, concealed by flesh and bone. Had I had a stroke? Is that why I didn't remember all of today?

I turned back and practically dashed back into my bedroom, grabbing my phone off the bed where I had thrown it in a panic, while also feeling my own face for any looseness. I opened my phone and tapped the emergency call, only for an automated, blankly cheery voice to immediately tone out: ""I'm sorry, but this device is currently-""

I threw the phone across the room, my heart beat combining with my headache to surge pandemonium into the forefront of my mind. I ran for my window, a wide sliding door to escape that lay just beyond my couch and coffee table. As soon as my hands reached the blinds, the pain in my head reached a crescendo, paralyzing both of my arms in unquenchable agony. I fell backwards, stumbling and landing on the ground as I rolled around in pain.

I screamed, banged against the walls with my still able legs, like a wild animal stuck inside a cage. I thrashed and cried out for a minute or two before my hyperventilating breaths took my energy from me. I lay on the ground, trying to regain my composure.

'All of this has a rational, reasonable explanation.' A voice murmured from the back of my mind, as confident in the statement as I was in my situation. With my nervous system finally coming out of its high alert state, I looked around, trying to get a grip.

""Knives gone, phone locked, and I can't get out of my fucking apartment,"" I said aloud, almost hoping someone would answer. I pushed myself off the ground, groaning as my legs, aching from the thrashing, refused my initial commands like unbroken horses. A dark whisper bubbled up from my mind, one which I didn't entirely know was mine, 'What if your body isn't yours anymore?'

I shook the thought away and stumbled to my phone: 9:49 PM.

My mind finally became steady, and I decided the best course of action was to fully examine myself, just to make sure I didn't have some tick or rash or lightning strike that could explain this. At that point, a lightning strike causing this was just as possible as lightning striking me and me not noticing in the first place.

Looking into my bathroom mirror, my back and chest were all clear, legs seemed fine. But as my arms grazed over one another, and as my hand scanned my right wrist, I could detect that there was something clearly wrong with the sensation, but it was hard to tell what. I rubbed my skin while looking closer, pressing down like I was trying to feel for worms, and the very thought made the inside of my flesh crawl with invisible bugs.

It was only when I pinched my skin did I realized what was off: my veins were, by perhaps a hair or two's length, bigger. They bulged like there was too much blood pumping through them. My mind went to my panic attack earlier, but even the rational part of my mind shot that down. 'This isn't normal,' it whispered, like a child watching their parents fight for the first time.

I spent the rest of the night pacing around the apartment, tracing my hands over the walls, tearing everything apart, with little reason. I was just trying to find something, anything. A spare phone, a knife, something. Nothing. My apartment was me proof. Trying to stand in front of the window to get the attention of anyone passing by would result in a full-body shock with me convulsing in pain on the floor, so I just left the blinds closed. Any attempts to open the door with a hanger yielded similar results.

Around 12:32 AM, when I was sitting on the floor eating a bowl of dry cereal, trying to come to terms with my current predicament, once again feeling like a dog with a shock collar, I heard a noise break the otherwise silent night.

The soft, otherworldly sound of a piano, ringing through the house, muted but definitely audible. The sound was almost ghostly, seeming to eminate from anywhere I directed my attention but never loud enough where it would make sense to hear it from the entire apartment. Was it inside my head?

The soft keys played an odd, melancholic melody. The notes drew themselves out painfully long at times, and others, cut short before finishing. It went on for about five minutes, tinging my home in a quiet and lonely sadness. Then, just as soon as it started, it stopped.

The rest of the night was spent ruminating, planning, trying to come up with something, anything. No one ever came, police or otherwise, to check on me after my screaming and banging, so either my walls are thicker than I thought or no one cares enough to try. I'm refusing to eat that burger, no real reason why.

When the sun started to rise, I was struck with a wave of exhaustion. My eyes grew heavy almost instantly, like bags of cement. I yawned, trying to stir myself into further awakeness, but the pins and needles crept across my body, laying me back down in bed. I felt my eyes roll into the back of my head, my consciousness being chased out of my body by some alien force. It felt disgusting, intrusive, like I was a glove being fitted. I felt my own fingers twitch like newborn insects as I slipped into dreams.

I woke up in my bed, the light of streetlamps bleeding into my bedroom. I groaned, honestly hoping that everything from my vague and hazy memories was just a dream. I rolled over and checked my phone. There was a message from an unknown number, sitting unopened on the screen.

""Can't wait to go out again! I had a really great time!""

I've been pacing around my apartment, out of ideas and feeling desperately trapped. My computer was, luckily, open to Reddit before all of this, and it seems that trying to switch off of this just results in more paralyzed pain. Maybe whatever is inside of me doesn't think I can do any harm; it hasn't seemed to care about my laptop at all.

My head has been killing me, so I might try sleeping, even though this might be all the conscious time I get for the day. My whole body feels twitchy and off, and occasionally, I'll notice my hand clenching and unclenching without me realizing. Like someone trying on a glove.

I'm so exhausted, I can barely keep my eyes open writing all of this down. It took a night, but if it's the last record of me, the real me, then it'll be worth it.

The sun is rising soon, and I can feel it dragging me to sleep again. I can only hope I wake up for another night.",1,1762908148.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

It was my final day off before I had to head back to work at a finance firm, and I had spent most of it lounging around, only leaving the house to pick up some groceries so I wouldn't have to do so after an exhausting day back.

When I was in the deli aisle, picking up some cheese for some tacos I was planning on making, a man walked up to me. He seemed dirty, in an oversized cargo jacket and worn-out jeans. His hair was tangled and greasy, but as he walked, I couldn't explain it fully, but his gait just didn't match him at all. He walked tall and straight, confident with a wide, toothy smile.

""Hello, sir, may I have a moment of your time?"" He asked, cool and clear as he outstretched a hand covered in a fingerless glove that looked like it hadn't been washed in decades. Just wanting him to go away, I took his hand and shook it, the cold sweat that was soaking his exposed skin seeping into my own dry palm.

""Hey, thanks, but I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. And I don't have any change.""

The man nodded politely, still smiling.

""Fair enough, sir, have a good day.""

He plodded off, and I watched as he approached a few others in the aisle, outstretching his hand but getting no takers other than me. I pulled out some Germex and rubbed it on my hands, hoping it wasn't some perv trying to spread a disease or his freshly rubbed dick stink.

The rest of the day was average, a little bit of gaming, keeping up with a couple of friends, but as it got closer to nightfall, my head started to throb. At first, I thought it was maybe allergies, or I hadn't been drinking enough water.

But by the time the sun went down, my head was screaming, like there was a nail being slowly driven deeper and deeper into my brain. No amount of Tylenol or Ibuprofen could even dampen it. But every time I checked my temp, it kept reading a nice lean 78 degrees.

I decided to try to get to sleep and, if in the morning it was still bad, I would call in from work and go to a walk-in clinic.

After an hour tossing and turning, I finally managed to pass out, only to wake up at 3:30 AM, with my head still absolutely screaming. I texted my boss, whom I thanked god I was on good terms with, that I wasn't gonna make it to the office today. Surprisingly, getting back to sleep was much easier than getting into it, and I slept wonderfully.

My eyes opened to a similar scene outside my bedroom window to what I had woken up to: a dark city at night, fluorescent lights making an artificial day. I yawned, feeling tired. Stretching, my body felt far more exhausted than my sleep should've left me; my shoulders ached with previous effort.

I checked my phone: 8:55 PM. 'Fuck, did I sleep through the entire day?' I thought, thankful that I was at least free from my headache. I realized there was no point in going back to sleep, so I just went through the motions of the day inside my apartment.

As I got up and went about my routine, I noticed my wallet was in a different spot than I remembered. I usually leave it on the kitchen table so I can grab it on my way out, but this time, it was on the counter where I usually drop it off after I get home. Odd, but not abnormal. 'Maybe I just put it there and forgot,' I thought.

Then, I saw my laundry room, the dryer rumbling as it squeezed all of the liquid out of my clothes. There was only one problem: I hadn't even put anything in the washer, let alone the dryer. I felt a tingle on the back of my neck, like someone was watching me notice oddities around my house. Instinctively, I checked around my ceiling, paranoia telling me there were now cameras in my home. I was only slightly relieved to discover a lack of anyone spying on me, but the feeling persisted.

I tried to come up with an excuse for the dryer as I stumbled into the kitchen, my head starting to hurt again. Opening the fridge just unhinged my reality a little further, as I saw a hamburger, still in its fast-food paper wrapping. 'Now, I KNOW that wasn't there before.' I thought, 'Had someone dropped by and gotten my laundry done and given me a burger? John, or maybe Chelsie? But they shouldn't have keys...' My thought trailed off as I heard a ding from my bedroom.

Walking back in, I found my phone in a pair of work pants, discarded on the side of the bed opposite the one I slept in. Pulling it out, a sense of dread slowly crept up my legs to fill my gut as I read a text I just received from 'Gigi from Work.'

""Thx for the help today!""

Weird. I checked the chat further and saw a text from 12:36 PM.

""Hey, you know anything about this new notice?"" Read, and apparently, responded to. 

The pit in my stomach grew into an immense chasm, nearly making me nauseous as I saw a text, apparently, sent by me.

""Yeah, I'll come over and let ya know. Too much to explain over texts.""

'What the fuck?' I thought. I hadn't gone anywhere all day. A growing, nagging voice began to chant in my mind, like a whisper, ""Something is wrong, something is wrong.""

The angles of my apartment felt wrong, like my home had been silently and suddenly turned into someone else's. The knife rack was empty, and seemingly, every sharp object in my apartment was gone. My screwdriver, toothpicks, tweezers, and anything that could be sharp or sharpened were gone.

I started storming around my apartment in a frenzied panic, wondering if someone had broken into my home, sent a text from my phone, left a burger in the fridge, and turned my laundry on to avoid raising suspicion. But that wouldn't make any sense, maybe if they had killed me, but I was still very much alive. And besides, why do all of that just to murder me? Offset the time of death?

Then, another thought hit me. The voice in the back of my mind whispered like a corrupted advisor, 'But if they're still inside, taking all the weapons, making everything seem normal, well...'

I grabbed the closest thing to a weapon I had, the metal bar of my coat rack, and went room by room, ensuring that I was completely alone in my house. This, rather than ease my nerves, only added to the sense of unreality that was creeping into my mind, slinking in like a snake into a burrow. 

What was 'I' doing while I was asleep? There was no way I was so sick that I pushed through the day, and then collapsed back at home after grabbing fast food and starting my laundry, and somehow completely forgot about it. Looking down at myself in horror, I realized I had even changed clothes, only now noticing the white button-up I usually wear to the office, instead of the plain t-shirt I had fallen asleep in. 

I reached to open the phone, trying to put in my passcode as genuine panic began to climb up my throat. I needed to get someone, anyone, to confirm what happened, to reassure me that I hadn't forgotten about an entire day. My fingers moved instinctually, and...

Incorrect Passcode.

""What?"" I said aloud, being a little shocked at the hoarseness of my own voice. Had I been talking a lot? In my sleep? AND changed my fucking passcode? My heart began to beat rapidly, my mind racing for any other possible codes, any time I changed it. I tried until it locked me out.

In a near state of panic, I rushed for the front door, desperate just to get out, talk to someone, reestablish any sense of normality. Bar still in hand, I reached for the door handle to finally escape, only for the most painful sensation of pins and needles to strike my hand limp. My fingers barely grazed over the handle as I jerked my arm away, my hand apparently fallen asleep as it stung my nerves with waves of agony. I let out a yelp, like a dog with a shock collar.

I backed away from the door like it was an electric fence, shaking my limp hand until I could contract my fingers. My blood was pumping, my fight or flight sending my entire nervous system on high alert. Mentally, I began checking myself: my breathing, my sight, all of my organs sitting inside fluid-filled sacs, concealed by flesh and bone. Had I had a stroke? Is that why I didn't remember all of today?

I turned back and practically dashed back into my bedroom, grabbing my phone off the bed where I had thrown it in a panic, while also feeling my own face for any looseness. I opened my phone and tapped the emergency call, only for an automated, blankly cheery voice to immediately tone out: ""I'm sorry, but this device is currently-""

I threw the phone across the room, my heart beat combining with my headache to surge pandemonium into the forefront of my mind. I ran for my window, a wide sliding door to escape that lay just beyond my couch and coffee table. As soon as my hands reached the blinds, the pain in my head reached a crescendo, paralyzing both of my arms in unquenchable agony. I fell backwards, stumbling and landing on the ground as I rolled around in pain. 

I screamed, banged against the walls with my still able legs, like a wild animal stuck inside a cage. I thrashed and cried out for a minute or two before my hyperventilating breaths took my energy from me. I lay on the ground, trying to regain my composure.

'All of this has a rational, reasonable explanation.' A voice murmured from the back of my mind, as confident in the statement as I was in my situation. With my nervous system finally coming out of its high alert state, I looked around, trying to get a grip.

""Knives gone, phone locked, and I can't get out of my fucking apartment,"" I said aloud, almost hoping someone would answer. I pushed myself off the ground, groaning as my legs, aching from the thrashing, refused my initial commands like unbroken horses. A dark whisper bubbled up from my mind, one which I didn't entirely know was mine, 'What if your body isn't yours anymore?'

I shook the thought away and stumbled to my phone: 9:49 PM. 

My mind finally became steady, and I decided the best course of action was to fully examine myself, just to make sure I didn't have some tick or rash or lightning strike that could explain this. At that point, a lightning strike causing this was just as possible as lightning striking me and me not noticing in the first place. 

Looking into my bathroom mirror, my back and chest were all clear, legs seemed fine. But as my arms grazed over one another, and as my hand scanned my right wrist, I could detect that there was something clearly wrong with the sensation, but it was hard to tell what. I rubbed my skin while looking closer, pressing down like I was trying to feel for worms, and the very thought made the inside of my flesh crawl with invisible bugs.

My wife and I are planning a move to the Twin Cities area this spring and are starting our housing research. I'm an avid cyclist, so I’m hoping to factor bikes into our search.

I'd love to get the sub’s insight on areas to check out. Here's some info to go on:

**Neighborhood Vibe:** If possible we're looking for a ""community node."" It would be great to be within walking distance of a good coffee shop, a few restaurants, or a brewery that has a low traffic route for biking. Who doesn’t love a few mile roll for their caffeine fix and a pastry? My wife would prefer to not be right next to the airport. (\~5ish miles)

**Bike Clubs:** Community is one of the things I love most about what bikes. It is really important to me to find a club because I find it both safer to ride and I’m an extrovert lol. If it helps I hope to continue to race cyclocross, enjoy bikepacking, and a good coffee ride. I haven’t done a ton of road racing but I’ve enjoyed doing enduro events like Seattle to Portland, Ride Across Wisconsin, and I just completed the DAMn this last summer! Based on my current club geographical proximity is super helpful especially on type 2 weather days. What clubs sound like they might be a good fit and where do they ride from?

**Housing:** Looking to get into a middle of the market home probably targeting 4 bedrooms so that we could host visitors for a longer stay comfortably.

**Bike Trails:** This is a big one. I’m more comfortable riding on the road but my wife is super excited about the trail infrastructure the cities has. We'd love to be reasonably close to the trail system for weekend rides.

**Bike Shops:** There have been lots of great threads on here but I’ve got an interesting twist on this one. What shop do you recommend for someone who likes to do maintenance on their bike but needs to learn along the way? I’ll outsource my bottom bracket but enjoy setting up my wheels tubeless and tunning my derailleur. My current shop knows I like to tinker but that I’ll order from the store rather than bailout and order on amazon.

**Commute**: I will need to commute to Eagan, but only about once a week. This means we're pretty flexible in terms of location. Although having visited friends this past summer, the Northwest burbs are probably off limits. I’d love to hear any thoughts anyone has about a bike commute to Eagan!

We're totally open to Minneapolis, St. Paul, or a suburb if it fits the bill. Trail access and neighborhood feel are probably more important than shaving a few minutes off the once-a-week commute.

Any and all suggestions are massively appreciated. Thanks!",6,1762907885.0,CyclingMSP,0,1.0,False

I'm a 32F nurse working 12-hour shifts, and I've been dealing with GERD for about three years now. It literally changed my entire life, and not in a good way.

It started gradually. I'd get occasional heartburn after eating pizza or drinking coffee, but I just chalked it up to stress from work. I was doing a lot of night shifts at the time, eating at weird hours, chugging coffee to stay awake. Then one night, I woke up at 3am feeling like I was literally dying. I couldn't breathe, my throat was on fire, and I was coughing so hard I thought I was going to throw up. That was my first real acid reflux attack and it scared the absolute shit out of me.

**What I Had to Cut Out**

This was the hardest part. I had to eliminate so many things I loved:

Coffee was brutal. I'm a nurse who literally survives on coffee during 12-hour shifts. I tried switching to decaf, but even that triggered symptoms. Eventually I found that green tea was okay in small amounts, but it's not the same.

Alcohol had to go completely. There went my wine nights with friends and my occasional beer after a rough shift.

Chocolate was devastating. Why does everything good cause reflux? I used to keep dark chocolate in my locker for a pick-me-up during breaks.

Tomatoes and tomato sauce meant bye-bye to pizza and pasta, which were my go-to easy meals after work.

Citrus fruits, fried and fatty foods, and spicy food all had to go too. Mint was a surprise - apparently it relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter, which makes reflux worse.

**What Actually Helped**

I started eating smaller, more frequent meals instead of three big ones. This was tricky with nursing shifts, but I meal-prepped small portions I could eat throughout the day.

The biggest game-changer was never eating within three to four hours of bedtime. This took serious discipline, especially after coming home starving at 8pm from a long shift, but it helped more than anything else.

**What I Eat Now**

I basically live on oatmeal, bananas, lean proteins like chicken and fish, brown rice, non-citrus fruits, vegetables (except tomatoes and onions), and almond milk. It's boring as hell, but my symptoms are so much better. I meal prep everything on my days off because if I don't have safe food ready, I'll make bad choices when I'm exhausted.

The diet changes have honestly been life-changing. I went from waking up choking multiple times a week to maybe having symptoms once a month if I slip up. It sucks giving up so many foods I loved, but being able to sleep through the night and not live in constant fear of an attack is worth it.",9,1762907857.0,GERD,9,0.91,False

I just wanted to post here to say that with everyone’s help, I have been able to secure a wheelchair. There is an amazing lady who was happy to give one away so I will be dropping it off to the man asap. 

Thank you all for being so generous and eager to help out, I think this was a great example of how strong our community is. The Madison homeless crisis is a big big big issue so pleaseeeee keep this energy going, especially as the weather gets worse. 

Blankets, food that doesn’t require electricity or many utensils, water, coats, socks, shoes, warm coffee, big bags for easier storage, anythinggggg that you think that you would want if you were in their position would do wonders. I’m even of the mindset that even if you give them money and they use it for drugs or alcohol, then so be it. I would want some whiskey, too. We all need to find comfort in our own ways and $20 won’t take away the fact that they are navigating homelessness in a country that does not want to help them. 

All we can do is what we can, and I hope that everyone can try to do some more good. All I did was make a post on Reddit so I don’t want this to come across as me having a savior complex or exploiting someone else’s suffering for my own ego, so I will leave it at that.

1ouqqk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OliviaRodrigoSnark_/comments/1ouqqk1/lyrics_that_cash_in_on_other_peoples_problems/,Lyrics that cash in on other people’s problems,"A collection of lyrics that cash in on other people’s hurt, whether it be women’s heartbreak, growing up as a teenager or serious mental health issues - now that we know she wasn’t actually experiencing those things but just wants to seem more interesting than she is because deep down, she’s a privileged valley girl. I never understood how we prioritised her teen break up during a literal pandemic:


All I see are girls too good to be true, with paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
 - jealousy, jealousy
Olivia is constantly praised for having a hot body so lyrics like this were not true to her but to cash in on the struggles of the average teen girl

And I see everyone getting all the things I want. And I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not. Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos
- jealousy, jealousy
Isn’t this literally just her life? Also, I always felt this song made her sound more bitter than insecure and incredibly out of touch

He played the drum in the marching band. He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad / My middle school friend grew up alone. She raised her brothers on her own. Her parents hated who she loved
- hope ur ok
Ok so…multiple things. Olivia was literally homeschooled. She also started appearing in movies at 11 so how was she making middle school friends? She implies the second girl is a lesbian but I’ve not seen Olivia have a single queer friend who isn’t a guy. You can’t just invent deeply troubled characters, based on real people’s struggles and think that’s ok - not even because you care but because you want people to view your songwriting as deep/serious. Genuinely crazy how none of her friends or family listened to that and was like…Wait, who is she talking about? 😂 And on the off chance these people were real then that also feels extremely shitty to use their struggles in a song for you to profit off of instead of reaching out to them or keeping that to yourself

I'm so insecure, I think that I'll die before I drink / And they'd all be so disappointed ‘cause, who am I, if not exploited? // I could list more lyrics but really it’s this whole song
- brutal 
This song was just crazy work. Now that she’s revealed she just enjoys writing sad songs and thought no-one would find it interesting if she talked about getting her iced coffee…genuinely may be a sociopath. Also, Olivia girl, be so serious; who was exploiting you? She paints this girl from the suburbs image but also that she’s this troubled child star - no-one knew who you were until a few months before you turned 18! You were legally an adult 😂 She so desperately wants to be Britney Spears and no-one seems to see it. It’s weird she kept referring to herself as a minor until 21 - she literally posted photos of herself the day before her birthday, captioned ‘Last day of being a minor’ in a really provocative pose 💀 It felt like those teen girls the day before they’re legally allowed to join P*rnHub. Also, some lines from that song annoyed me like ‘This the kind of thanks I get?’ or ‘I’m so caught up in the news of who likes me and who hates you’ cause it really highlights her narcissism 

Olivia really is a put-together Frankenstein version of every other person’s struggles and personality. Who the hell is she?",2,1762907800.0,OliviaRodrigoSnark_,0,1.0,False

Dear ***,

I keep thinking I’m getting over you, but then I’ll start to feel this ache again. Like whenever I listen to Sza, all I can think about is you and how you told me you really like her music. Whenever I open my fridge, I see a bottle of simple syrup from that night when I made cocktails for us. I think about how validated I felt when you looked at my photos and could see them from the perspective of an artist. Whenever it rains I think about the day we met up during your lunch break and….well, you know.

I know I probably ruined any chance of ever having you again in a romantic sense. I was too much. I got invested too quickly. And my emotional reactions to you pulling away probably just turned you off more towards me. 

I miss you though. I don’t know how to make it go away. I still want to take photos of you during golden hour. I want to make dirty  martinis again and lay my head on your chest while we pretend to watch some movie. I want to talk about the hard things with you. I want to wake up next to you. I want to make you coffee in the morning. I want to go look at art with you. 

 And now I just wonder if I seem crazy to you for letting our time together leave such an impression on me. You probably are glad to be rid of me. I still think of you.

1ouqlor,https://i.redd.it/8h7ob16ltp0g1.jpeg,Goodbye my best friend. The smartest little guy I ever knew.,"We had to say good bye to our beloved Pap this weekend due to a sudden heart problem. We are completely stunned and devastated as we had no idea his heart was having problems. He was 11 1/2. Kind of beating myself up thinking I should have did this or that, but I know I was a good dad and we were very close.

He was my first dog and was our first dog together. We moved across the country and bought our first home with him. He was a significant part of our story. He taught me why they are called man's best friends. We work from home and spent nearly every day with him. I spent more time with him than any pet I've had or most humans for that matter. I'm so lucky to have had that time. He was truly the most special animal I've ever met. 

I'm not sure if its a Papillon thing or if its a him thing. He was the most uniquely intelligent dog. We always thought of him more as a human dog. The level of communication we had with him blew our minds. He knew roughly 50 words and phrases. The word **coffee** to him meant that he got to get up on the counter and have some milk froth before we poured it into our lattes. **Gravy** meant that we were going to add some sort of chicken juice to his dry food. Say those words and he would come running. We could lay his toys out and tell him the pick one out of the crowd by its name. Get **frog**. He knew what **kiss** meant and we made him give us one every day even though sometimes he resisted he would eventually give us one. He would let us know he needed something and we could say, **hungry**, **thirsty**, **potty** and he would bark when we said the right word. I've never seen anything like it. He was like a 2 year old child to me. 

I miss him so much and the house is so quite and empty feeling. He of course was very vocal and did bark a lot. Used to drive us crazy sometimes but I would give anything to hear that bark right now. He was the first and last thing I saw every day. Going to bed and waking up are the hardest parts for me right now. 

I know we'll heal but I needed to post to share with a community that I think probably understands what a papillon really is all about. 

Rest in peace my beloved. Most people haven't affected me the way you have. Love you.",11,1762907439.0,papillon,1,1.0,False

Well in January I had a gut feeling something was giving to happen within the year. To the ppintbtgey hospitalized me although I did say something about self harm so anyway but I kept getting told ""hes not sick now"" and ""live in the moment "" that one REALLY set me coffee because I've spent years being told I need to plan ahead.

So Sept comes he falls on his bootie getting out the chair.  Its like 630. I could tell it was serious but not life or death.  So I find him he begs me not to call 911. Well after going back and forth I set up a fold out stool as a table and put everything he'd need, I am a long term recovering addict but am on methadone so I made him a deal if when I git back he has ti get up, call my like 6'5 cousin to come or 911.

911 was my only option.  And I care. I care that my dad is suffering but I am losing everything.  I can't bring anything fabric because of ""bed bugs"" but just DRY THEM!!

She streched and yawned, as she sat up. Max's arm wrapped around her waist as he woke up next to her. ""Good Mourning beautiful."" he mumbled through a yawn and hugged her close to him, her sitting up and him laying beside. She smiled down at his face and gave him a quick kiss on the lips ""Good mourning to you too handsom."" she said into his mouth. Her smile and his matching. His arm raised to her lower back and pressed against her as he leaned upwards to give her a deeper kiss. She melted into it and swung one leg over his body to straddle him as she placed either hand on the side of his head and deepend the kiss. 


His hands both started rubbing her back and sliding down to her butt. He squeezed and she moaned a little into his mouth. He groaned back the kiss becoming more intense as her hands moved to his chest. Feeling the tight muscles and squeezing them carefully, as so not to hurt him. Her hips moved on there own and his followed. ""Do you want to?"" she asked breathlessly ""yes."" Max said into her mouth. She raised herself away from his lips and took her nightshirt off. Max's hands raised to her bare chest and she moaned as his warm hands met her breasts, the nipples hardening in the cool room's air. They both locked eyes and an understanding took place, words need not be said they both knew what the other wanted. Just as Max reached down between them to adjust himself for what came next, the dorbell rang. ""Fuck."" May said as she glared across the apartment using her ability to see through walls to see who was interrupting her Max time. 


She sighed and swung her leg off the bed and slowly stood. ""It's Clyde and Evee, and they have a box of doughnuts with them and coffee."" Max groaned but sat up and swung his legs off the bed also. ""Well it isnt like we can just pretend were not hom. Since your cousin can totally see us when he wants."" May sighed also, ""He is such a clam jammer. Thats twice now he has interrupted us. I think he is messing with us."" Max laughed. ""Did you just say clam jammer?"" ""I heard it from one of the movies Katerina brought over to the Glacier of Solace. I thought it was kinda funny after Katerina explained it to me."" ""Have you been waiting to use that one."" May's eyes shifted away ""none of your business."" she said as she put on a robe to go answer the door. Max, smiling at her back, put on his own robe. The robes had been a housewarming present they found hanging in the bathroom. One was silver with a gold M embroidered on one side and was fitted for women and the other was gold with a silver m embroidered on it and fitted for men. 


He followed May having a hard time not staring at her ass in the robe. He really liked how she filled that robe out. She looked over her shoulder at him and winked before her eyes roamed over his body and she stared at his groin. ""Max you may want to find a way to hide that. Before I let Clyde and Evee in. Max looked down and saw his tent. ""Good idea I am going to run to the restroom to handle my wardrobe malfunction."" He headed towards the bathroom, May's musical laugh behind him not helping him at all. 'such a wonderful laugh.' he thought to himself as he closed the bathroom door behind him. 


May, now alone, opened the door for Evee and Clyde. ""Good mourning we brought you breakfast!"" Clyde said. ""I hope we aren't interrupting anything."" Evee said. ""Not anymore."" May grumbled as she let them in. ""Whats that mean?"" Evee asked and May just stared at her for a moment with her hand on her hip and the other one playing with the edge of her robe. Evee's eyes widened as she put things together. ""Oh shit. Sorry May I had no idea."" She glared at Clyde. ""Why didnt you tell me? we could have come by later and given these two a little more time to themselves."" Clyde shrugged as he put the food and coffee down on the table. ""I didnt look, it's rude to look in someones living space. You never know what you might see and sometimes you see stuff you never wanted to."" Clyde told Evee with a tone of voice that screamed he had seen some stuff he wishes he could forget. May took note of his reaction and decided that she didnt ever want to go snooping in her friends and family's personal living space. No telling what she would see that she never could unsee. 


""Wheres Max?"" Clyde asked ""He's umm... well you see he had a um...."" May stammered embarressed her face growing red. ""No need May I can guess. Sorry again."" Evee apologized, being a great girlfriend at that moment. May hugged her. ""Thanks for getting it Evee."" ""Getting what?"" Clyde asked, everything they had talked about going over his head. ""Nothing dear."" Evee responded. Clyde looked at May and May quickly shoved a doughnut into her mouth to stop him from asking a question. 


The toilet flushed in the other room and Max came out in his robe. ""Good mourning you too!"" he said in a chipper voice. May could see that he was annoyed but she also knew he wouldnt bring it up with them. Her and him always had later to explore each other in greater detail. May quickly excused herself and went to the bathroom to clean herself up a little. She needed to dry off a bit before she felt comfertable around family. 


Clyde looked over at Max ""Shes acting odd today."" ""Nope not at all odd."" Max responded before eating a doughnut himself. ""Why the visit so early in the mourning?"" he asked as he grabed a coffee and mixed in some sugar and halfnhalf. 


""Well we got good news for both of you."" Evee told Max with excitment. ""We got you and May internships at the Municiple Times Newspaper."" Evee had a broad smile quite proud of herself for getting them both internships. ""O thats cool, but dont you need an ID to get a job?"" Max asked her. ""Good news!"" Clyde said ""We got May and you both IDs."" Clyde pulled two white envelopes from his pocket and placed them on the table. One had Max written on it and the other said May. 


""Whats this?"" Max asked picking up his envelope. ""It's a new ID for you. Brad set it up not liking that you didnt have a last name. So he chose one for you and May. Max stares at the envelope as he dips a peice of doughnut into his coffee. A toilet flushes and May comes out of the bedroom moments later. ""I feel much better now."" She says and winks at Max, he winks back. She smiles and blushes a little as does he. Neither having used the restroom for the normal purpose that mourning. As May walks up to the table Max passes her her envelope.


""Want to open them together?"" He asked her. ""What are they?"" May asked back. ""There your new Identification cards."" Evee answerd her question. ""On three?"" May asked Max. ""On three."" he responded.


""One"" she said ""two"" he said ""Three"" she said as she ripped hers open and gasped when she saw the card taped to a birthcertificate and Social Security Card. Tears crept from her eyes and she hugged her cousin hard. ""My new name is May Conners. I love it Clyde!"" He hugged her back ""We might be cousins but know I think of you as my sister and now the state sees you as my little sister."" May's eyes fill with unshed tears ""Whats your name Max?"" she asked as she sniffled a little. ""My new name is Max Conners. Why is my last name conners?"" ""That is odd."" Evee said, ""Let me see."" Evee took Max's ID and papers. 


She flipped through them and found one at the bottom. She read it then yanked May's envelope from her hand and went through her papers before pulling out one that matched the one she pulled from Max's envelope. ""Well heres the reason. Mr. Vickers decided that you two were married."" She places the two duplicate marrige certificates on the table. Each had been signed by both May and Max and Max noticed that he had taken May's last name. His name was now Maxwell Vickers-Conners. ""Oh thats odd. I approve though."" Evee mentioned as she saw the names. ""Seems legally your now related to Brad Vickers Max. ""Should I be worried?"" Max asked.



""No well maybe people will bother you for money, but I doubt it. Brad isnt as well known in this city as he is in Darkholm."" May pouts. ""So were married and there wasnt one of those really pretty events like in the movies? I was really wanting one of those. A wedding."" Max looked at her then his ID then did a mental shrug. He bent down on one knee in front of May and grabed her hand in his. ""May will you do me the honor of letting me take your last name and spending the rest of my life with you?"" May looked at him shocked then smiled broadly ""Of course! So long as we have a big wedding like in those movies."" Max laughed ""Of course May we will have the best wedding."" May pulled him back to his feet and kissed him deeply on the mouth. He kissed back until Evee coughed awkwardly. 


""Well that was unexpected. I hope I am invited to the wedding."" She said. ""Of course you are Evee! May said, so long as you can promise that Clyde and you will leave us alone for a few days afterwards."" May gave Eveee a look and Evee understood and smiled. ""Sure thing. I hate it when me and Clyde get interrupted also."" Then Evee looked at Clyde ""Your cousin isnt even on this planet a year and she is legally married to Max. How much longer before were legally married Clyde?"" Clyde stopped eating his doughnut and looked like a deer in headlights 


""We could all get married together."" Max suggested trying to throw Clyde a lifeline. Clyde looked gracious and said ""Good idea Max. What do you think Evee? a double wedding?"" Evee thought about that for a moment then there was a sharp clap as May's hands came together. ""Thats perfect! We can have a double wedding! I love it!"" May excitidly said. Clyde coughed feeling kinda weird that Brad did this to him. 'I am going to get him back for this.' he thought to himself about his best friend. 


""So we originally arrived to give you those letters from Brad and to tell you about your new jobs."" ""Jobs?"" May asked. ""Yes your going to have to pick up the bills on this place eventually. It's paid off but you still have taxes and utilities to pay for."" Clyde told his cousin now legal sister. 


""Oh so whats the jobs?"" Max askes him. ""Well I got you a job in the mailroom Max and May has a job answering the phones."" Evee responded. ""They don't pay the greatest but every year there are two raises if your good at your job. They also only give higher positions in the company to people already working there. So basically everyone either starts in the mailroom or answering phones."" Clyde told Max with a slight smile on his face as he remembered his first days working in the mailroom. 


""So when do we start?"" Max wonders. ""Oh tomarrow mourning at 8am on the dot. Dont be late or Mr. Patrick will scream at you. He basically always screams though so it isnt too bad."" Evee laughs as she tells Max and May. 


Max finally sits down at the table and May sits next to him with Evee and Clyde sitting across. Max and May look at each other for a few minutes before both ask at the same time ""Do you want to do this?"" then they both laugh and say ""If your there."" ""You two are sickenly cute sometimes. I am starting to understand why people call Clyde and me a sickenly cute couple."" Evee laughs as she eats another doughnut  


""So why arrive so early to tell us this?"" Max askes the other couple. ""Well we figured that since you two have been working hard on yourselves for over four months without much of a break. We could take the day and show you around town and maybe help you get some work clothing and a few other items for your condo."" Clyde mentions. ""Basically we want to take you on a shopping day."" Evee clarified. ""Can we visit a Mall?"" ""Sure. I love the Mall."" Evee said. Clyde groaned and Max got excited. A 80's mall had an arcade he just knew it. He missed them since they kinda vanished in his time and world. He could show May some of the coolest games from the 80's. ""I am down for a Mall trip."" he said. ""Just let May and I take a shower first. I still kinda smell like bruning building from last night."" May nods in agreement. 


""Well if you two need extra time..."" Evee says trailing off not sure how to finish. Max and May blush and Clyde looks at them finally getting it. ""oh... OH!"" His eyes widen as he finally puts it together he looks at Evee ""did we?"" ""interrupt some special time? yes dear we did."" ""Oh man I didnt mean to be a clam jammer."" Clyde whispered to his love ""What movies are you watching with Katerina? to get such sayings?"" Evee asks her fiance ""There good movies."" May responds. ""Oh she got you to watch 'The Mistresss and the Queen' also?"" ""Ya and I love some of the lines in it. Its an independent film but pretty good. That clam jammmer line will ive in my head forever though."" Clyde laughs. Evee and Max look at each other not having watched the movie.  Katerina had a unique taste in media. 


They spoke for a bit longer before Evee and Clyde made there excusses and left. Making an agreement to meet up in the downstairs lobby in an hour. Max and May cleaned up a bit and then went to take a shower. Both teased the idea of going a little further in the shower but decided to keep the shower as it was. A special time for them to talk and wash each others hair, something that for both of them was far from sexual. They were tempted afterwards but didnt have the time. Both swearing to each other they would find the time soon. Especially since they were now legally husband and wife. Brad did have an odd sense of humour or he just had a soft spot for familys and love. Max couldnt decide and May didnt care, she was just happy that she had such a family. Something she never thought she would have again. ",1,1762907249.0,Maxwell_Isekaied,0,1.0,False

Previously a magistrate judge looked at the allegations and evidence against Logan Paul and other individuals involved with CryptoZoo with regards to charges being brought by people who felt defrauded by CryptoZoo. This is separate from the defamation suit that Paul brought against Coffeezilla.

[In that magistrate judge's opinion](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1205016/gov.uscourts.txwd.1205016.107.0_1.pdf) he recommended that 26 of the counts against Logan Paul be dismissed without prejudice (meaning the defrauded investors can amend the complaint and file those counts again). And the 27th count should be dismissed with prejudice (meaning the plaintiffs cannot bring a suit with that charge again). But the magistrate judge's report is just an opinion for the district judge. Everyone was expecting the district judge to accept the recommendations, but there is always the chance he does not.

The document linked to by the post itself is a 2 page decision by the district judge agreeing with the magistrate judge. Meaning that currently Logan Paul is free and clear of CryptoZoo drama, except for the ongoing lawsuit against CoffeeZilla for calling Paul a scammer.

If you played Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: Russia, you know the girl Nikolai Orelov helps escape? That’s Anastasia Romanova. And at the end of that game, she literally takes the name Anna Anderson. That’s canon. Ubisoft already did it. And then they just… never continued her story, they ended right after ww1 in 20s

In AC canon, she came into contact with both the Precursor Box and a Piece of Eden during the Romanov execution. That caused a memory bleed linked to Shao Jun (from Chronicles: China), who was trained by Ezio himself. So Anna doesn’t suddenly become a super Assassin. She moves, reacts, climbs, and survives based on instinctive echoes of Shao Jun’s training. That’s the same mechanism as the Bleeding Effect with Desmond, Clay, etc. It tracks. It fits. No retcon needed.

Now put her in Berlin, 1945.

We already know from AC2’s glyphs and extended lore that: Hitler was under the influence of a Piece of Eden, He didn’t actually die in the bunker, He killed a body double to fake it, And when he tried to escape Berlin with the artifact, an Assassin killed him outside the bunker.

That’s already the official story.

So the game opens with that. Not as a “final boss.” Not as a power fantasy. Just a desperate chase through collapsing Berlin. No epic speech. No glory. Just history correcting itself quietly in the dark.

Hitler dies in the prologue.

Fade to black.

Wake up as Layla, where she heard news that it's not over, and when you get back into the animus, you do one sync a

Boom game title (Assassin creed black dawn or something)

The player thinks, “Oh. Wait. This isn’t the end… this is the start.”

Because the real threat wasn’t Hitler. It was the ideology and the Templar occult machine behind him — the Ahnenerbe, artifact expeditions, the plan to preserve the Reich ideologically after defeat. Himmler becomes the real antagonist, not as “the boss,” but as the architect of a narrative meant to survive the war.

And Anna’s story becomes: Not killing the man. But stopping the myth that replaces him.

She’s not fighting for revenge, or a country, or a throne. She’s fighting against erasure — the same force that tried to erase her family, her identity, and truth itself.

It feels like Assassin’s Creed again:

Forged papers

Quiet kills

Codes stitched into clothing

Resistance networks

Library basements

Cairo digs where we can reference Bayek and Aya

Jerusalem archives where referenced Altïar

Small victories that no one will ever know happened

Not a war game. A memory game. A game about fighting the story that would overwrite the world.

And the best part is: The protagonist isn’t new. She’s been there since 2016. We just haven’t played her middle chapter yet.

Haven't beat origins yet or start odyssey - Valhalla - Mirage - Shadows.

Anyway, Ubisoft, if you’re reading this… I accept coffee, NDAs or/and free copy of shadow. XD",1,1762907056.0,assassinscreed,0,1.0,False

I’m going on a first date this weekend with a girl who lives in Manhattan. I just moved to New Jersey, so I’m not too familiar with the city yet. We agreed to meet somewhere in Manhattan, and she’s free after 1 PM.

I’m looking for ideas and specific spots for a cozy first date in the winter … somewhere we can talk and get to know each other. It could be a coffee shop, a cocktail bar, or maybe an activity if it’s not too cold. Ideally, I’d love a place with a relaxed, speakeasy-style vibe.

I’m in my 30s and want the date to feel comfortable and a bit classy without being over the top. Any recommendations for places or ideas that fit that vibe?

Thanks in advance!

I'll have 2 days to kill from about 10-4. I'm hoping to find a couple streets or small neighborhoods where I can have an Uber dump me and I can hit some quirky shops, sit and have coffee, maybe a bakery, and nosh.  

Like Valencia St in the Mission District in SF where they have a taxidermy/rock shop, fine chocolate, books, cutlery, pirate supply shop and a bunch of other stuff all within a few blocks. 

I'd love to support some local small businesses and bonus for LGBTQIA+, immigrant owned, and other similar places.

1ouqfet,https://i.redd.it/9t2n567jzp0g1.jpeg,"I vibe coded a Micro SaaS in one night, ran a 7-day organic marketing sprint, and it made $64","I wanted to see how far I could take a new product using only organic marketing. No ads, no agencies, just consistent systems and execution.

So I built a small consumer SaaS overnight, an AI image generator for couples. Nothing complicated, just something simple I could ship fast. I coded it in Cursor in about two hours, set up payments, and decided to run a 7-day organic sprint.

I used a few warmed-up accounts I already had across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube Shorts and scheduled one post per day for the week. Here’s exactly what I did:

**Step 1:** I searched Reddit for people asking about “AI couple photo generators” or “AI family portrait ideas” and replied naturally with my product. No pitch, just helping. I also wrote story-style posts in relationship communities like “this trend made my partner cry,” mentioning the product naturally in the story.

**Step 2:** I posted shortform educational slideshows like “Top 5 things I learned about AI couples photos.” Simple, clean, and easy to watch.

**Step 3:** I made AI UGC demo videos that started with a shocked AI avatar and text like “OMG I can’t believe I just found this couples generator,” followed by a short product demo.

**Step 4:** I added meme-style green screen videos like “POV: you just tried this couples image generator” paired with funny reactions.

**Step 5:** I tested wall-of-text videos where an AI avatar just sits sipping coffee while a huge block of text scrolls in front saying things like “that moment you realise your partner actually looks amazing in AI photos together.”

That was the full setup. Everything scheduled, five minutes of community engagement each day, and I didn’t check Stripe until the week ended.

When I finally looked, it showed $64 MRR. From three hours of total setup.

No paid ads. No luck. Just systems that worked.

The wild part is this wasn’t even about the product. The whole thing was an experiment to test what we’re building at Aftermark AI, a platform that lets small SaaS teams handle all these marketing tasks in one place from start to finish.

Our beta users had been saying it helped them get installs and conversions, but I wanted to feel it firsthand.

And it worked.

If a random weekend project can pull that off, imagine what happens when you apply the same system to a product you actually care about.

Every time there's a move, change in seasons, a new start to the year, a new location (e.g. back from vacation etc.) I always pair it with making these grand plans for the \*perfect\* routine like oh now that things are different I'll definitely get up and walk in the morning, then a bit of meditation, do a workout, eat a healthy lunch, get some work done and then some yoga and read a book, do a nice relaxing skincare routine and light a candle etc etc.

Then what actually happens is I wake up, feel instantly not into walking so then I have no momentum to build on and just grab coffee and start scrolling on my phone. Then I can get maybe one or two things done during the day (a short walk or a workout, maybe read one chapter) but am mostly a blob and then all the days run together and I'm like well there goes the opportunity for a fresh start, there's no way I can get into my perfect routine now that I've failed at it for the past 3 weeks...like point of no return.

Asking because I'm curious if this is just a human thing or more of an autistic thing since I know growing up routines and list making were ways I self-soothed so I'm assuming this is just another iteration but it's quite distressing when I can never measure up to my own lofty ideals lol!",10,1762906834.0,AutismInWomen,2,1.0,False

Life isn't always a walk in the park. So how do happy people get through a rough day? These tips are small things that happy people do to make life just a little bit better, and now you can too.

# They Turn Mistakes Into Lessons:

As much as we try to strive for [**perfection,**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-perils-of-striving-for-perfection/) mistakes are an inevitable part of life. While it's easy to beat yourself up when a new job just isn't working out or a relationship falls apart, focusing on learning from what went wrong will help you turn a mistake into something productive. When something goes wrong, consider it an opportunity to grow and become an even better version of yourself.

# They Go Offline:

https://preview.redd.it/tmi8qeopyp0g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a7ee9f72763d6213cceeac3a773c6b46b2b7f56

Obsessing over social media sites is a bad habit that we all have but looking at pictures of other people's amazing vacations and delicious desserts isn't doing anything for *you*. Make a pact with yourself to unplug every day — you can read a book or call a friend — but just signing off allows you to live your life instead of watching other people live theirs.

# They Don't Sweat the Small Stuff:

Bad days happen. You spill coffee down your shirt running out the door, you accidentally overdraft a card. . . . There are plenty of instances where anger, disappointment, and anxiety are totally reasonable reactions, but they don't have to be your final reactions. Learning to let go of the little things you can't control will allow you to focus better on the positive aspects of life. While those small things totally suck, there's something great around the corner that is more worthy of your time and energy.

# They Plan Getaways:

Even if you can't afford a cross-continent trip, there are plenty of budget-friendly ways to get out there and see the world. Experiencing a new culture or food or a change in scenery is a great way to bring a little extra happiness into your life. Whether you book a trip alone or with a buddy, traveling helps you to create memories that you will never forget.

# They Say Thank You:

Saying [**thank you**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/say-thank-you-a-fundamental-principle-of-civility/) is an easy way to pay it forward and make everyone's day a little brighter. During a busy day, take a second to stop and be grateful for the small stuff. It may not come naturally, but in the long run, it really will increase your happiness. Whether it's a friendly checkout person at the drugstore or a co-worker who holds the elevator so you can jump in, there are plenty of opportunities to stop and appreciate the little things.

# They Give Themselves a Break:

Putting in long hours at the office is draining, but there's a little trick that will help you to be both happier and more productive: take a break. Even if you bring your own lunch, step out for a brisk walk around the block. Getting your body moving and taking your eyes off your screen will help you come back after just five minutes, feeling refreshed and ready to tackle whatever project is up next on the agenda.

# They Turn a To-Do List Into a Game:

Doing chores is not usually considered fun, but there are ways to transform busywork into something more exciting. The next time you need to tackle a bedroom cleanup, set a phone timer for 10 minutes and race against the clock to accomplish as much as you can while time ticks away. Ten minutes will be over before you know it, and in your haste to beat the clock, you'll find that a daunting task has disappeared before your eyes.

# They Build Relationships:

https://preview.redd.it/4bydr1sqyp0g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=27f03e32ec7a88b80f04aa6fdde0b160e54456f3

Maintaining [**friendships**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-amazing-benefits-of-friendship-its-powerful-impact-on-your-life/) is an important part of leading a happy and full life. Whether you have a few close friends or a big social circle, keeping in contact and having a buddy to cheer you up can make a huge difference.

# They Don't Blame the Past:

Instead of dwelling on the things that went wrong in your past, make your time more meaningful by looking to the future. When you stay positive and think about the things you can accomplish, you're able to find peace with the things that may not have gone your way before.

# They Fake It Till They Make It:

Some days just start off bad, and from the moment you wake up, you really just want an excuse to stay under the covers. When you have no choice but to get up and face the day, try faking a smile through your morning routine.

# They Take Chances:

Instead of waiting for opportunities to fall into your lap, take control. Putting yourself out there can feel like a challenge, but once you take a risk, whether it's searching for a new job or asking a friend out on a date, you will be rewarded.

# They Get Sleep:

Catching a few extra hours of [**sleep**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/why-getting-enough-sleep-matters/) can make a big difference. When you're feeling groggy or under the weather, it's hard to put your best foot forward. While you definitely shouldn't sacrifice your plans just to hit the hay, make sure you make time to catch up on your sleep.

# They Get Moving:

https://preview.redd.it/pxer85yryp0g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=78e88eee01dd5aa0aceb52b3e572ad5276055ca0

While a marathon may not be on the horizon, physical activity is an important part of leading a happier life. Working out releases endorphins and help you banish a blah mood for good.

# They Are Honest:

They say ""honesty is the best policy,"" and when it comes to health and happiness, this couldn't be more true. Lies cause stress and anxiety, and life is too short not to live authentically.

# They Don't Compare Themselves to Others:

Everyone has their own path in life, and when you start to compare yours to others', you take focus away from personal progress. While jealousy can be hard to beat, learning to let go of how you stack up to others will ultimately help you to focus on your own successes.

*Coffea ☕ 
Notes: orris, aldehydes, coffee, peru balsam

My thoughts: I don't get much orris but do get the coffee, but it's not one of those overwhelming or too sweet coffee fragrances that seem to dominate the market. It's slightly sweet (maybe the orris?) and wears very light, but definitely pleasant. 3.5/5

* Leaf 🌿 
Notes: lime, aldehydes, cardamom, mint

My thoughts: In terms of intensity, this and Coffea are the lightest of the bunch. Smells very faintly of mojito. Nice, but not very interesting and hard to detect. 3/5

*Black Tea ☕ 
Notes: cinnamon, osmanthus, aldehydes, black tea 

My thoughts: Now we're talking - this one smells like a delicious spiced tea. More cinnamon than sugar, which I like because fragrances that are too sweet get tiring to wear IMO. Moderate intensity, which is my preference. Will probably get the travel sized version of this one (not the full sized bottle only because I don't like to buy full size bottles until I've finished a 10ml decant/travel bottle first). 4.5/5

*Earth 🌍 
Notes: rose, aldehydes, patchouli

My thoughts: I find this one addictive to smell when sampled on my hand but also I'm afraid to do a full wearing in case it's too much to smell all day (and I would smell it all day because it is strong). It's sharp (?) but not in a bad way. It does smell like weird potting soil to me, and is similar to Le Labo Baie 29 but better IMO from the addition of rose - with a side by side comparison, Baie feels more muddled and gray. Gets more straightforwardly rosey on the dry down. Another one that I might get in the travel size. 4/5

*Miel 🍯 
Notes: aldehydes, jasmine, honey, cedarwood, vetiver

My thoughts: A very naturalistic, slightly animalistic, almost dirty honey. Not sweet at all and stronger than you'd expect. I don't actually like smelling it, and I wouldn't think it was a fragrance if I smelled it on someone else - I would maybe think that they needed to bathe. But for a designer house, it's pretty bold and weird, so I think it's cool that it made it into the collection. 2/5

*Smoke 🔥 
Notes: elemi, aldehydes, cedarwood, cade oil

My thoughts: This may be obvious from the notes, but this is more of an incense smoke than a campfire or cigarette smoke. I would really think someone had been burning incense if I smelled this in a room. Slightly sweet, but a little bit smothering when smelled up close. Might actually make a great air freshener lol. 3.5/5


In conclusion: If you like to smell fragrances that are unique and not trying to be mass appealing, I definitely recommend this discovery set. Despite the presence of aldehydes in all of them, I wouldn't say they come across as very aldehydic; the aldehydes are subtle and definitely there in support of the other notes. Based on the name of the series, I assume a part 2 will be coming out eventually and I'm looking forward to trying those as well.",1,1762906562.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False

# They Fake It Till They Make It:

Some days just start off bad, and from the moment you wake up, you really just want an excuse to stay under the covers. When you have no choice but to get up and face the day, try faking a smile through your morning routine.

# They Take Chances:

Instead of waiting for opportunities to fall into your lap, take control. Putting yourself out there can feel like a challenge, but once you take a risk, whether it's searching for a new job or asking a friend out on a date, you will be rewarded.

# They Get Sleep:

Catching a few extra hours of [**sleep**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/why-getting-enough-sleep-matters/) can make a big difference. When you're feeling groggy or under the weather, it's hard to put your best foot forward. While you definitely shouldn't sacrifice your plans just to hit the hay, make sure you make time to catch up on your sleep.

# They Get Moving:

While a marathon may not be on the horizon, physical activity is an important part of leading a happier life. Working out releases endorphins and help you banish a blah mood for good.

# They Are Honest:

They say ""honesty is the best policy,"" and when it comes to health and happiness, this couldn't be more true. Lies cause stress and anxiety, and life is too short not to live authentically.

# They Don't Compare Themselves to Others:

Everyone has their own path in life, and when you start to compare yours to others', you take focus away from personal progress. While jealousy can be hard to beat, learning to let go of how you stack up to others will ultimately help you to focus on your own successes.

Nothing fancy. Just a fun idea I could test fast. I literally vibe coded it in Cursor in an hour or two. 

I’ve previously built an ecommerce brand to 6 figures and built a consumer app that went semi-viral, so I had a strong hypothesis that organic marketing could be cracked in SaaS…

So I opened up a few warmed-up accounts I’d been sitting on across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube Shorts, and scheduled a full week’s worth of content. One post per day, all planned out in advance.

Here’s what I created:

1. First, I searched Reddit for people asking about “AI couple photo generators” or “AI family portrait ideas” and replied naturally with my product. No hard pitch, just helping out. Then I made story-style posts in relationship communities, writing casual little narratives like “this trend made my partner cry” and subtly mentioning the product inside the story.

2. Next, I made shortform videos. Two per day. First up was educational slideshows like “Top 5 things I learned about AI couples photos” that felt native to the platform.

3. Then I dropped some AI UGC demo videos that opened with a shocked AI avatar and overlay text like “OMG I can’t believe I just found this couples generator,” followed by a quick 6 second product demo.

4. I also experimented with relatable meme-style content. Green screen memes like “POV: you just tried this couples image generator” with a funny reaction clip. 

5. Finally, i posted a few wall-of-text videos where an AI avatar just sits there sipping coffee while a massive block of relatable text scrolls in front, saying things like “that moment you realise your partner actually looks amazing in AI photos together.”

That was it. I scheduled everything for the week, spent maybe five minutes each day replying to people our AI sourced as good leads, and promised myself not to check Stripe until the end.

When I finally opened it, there it was, $64 MRR. From literally three hours of setup.

No ads. No luck. Just a system that worked.

And the crazy part is, this wasn’t even about the product. The entire thing was an experiment to see if what we’re building at Aftermark AI actually delivers (you can do all of these marketing tasks in the one platform, from A-Z).

Our beta users had been telling us it was helping them get installs and conversions, but I wanted to feel it firsthand.

And I did. It worked. 

If I can do it in 3 hours with a silly product, you can do it easily. Keep shipping 🫡",1,1762906394.0,SaaS,2,1.0,False

In 2019 I had a serious flare up of what I now believe to be erythomelagia, and was evaluated for MCAS and allergic reactions by my allergist, and saw a rheumatologist and neurologist who had no answers for me and left me feeling crazy. Since then, I have had symptoms on and off for years and have not had answers, and worried about what might be causing this. 

My symptoms are as such: burning feet that tends to be worse at night although if I get overheated it can almost feel unbearable to keep my shoes on. My feet can be incredibly hot the touch and I sometimes need ice packs for relief. A rash on my face that seems to be related to certain triggers (alcohol/certain foods/coffee) and the rash feels like it’s burning almost like a candle flame is under my skin and is hot to the touch. I get red hot ears on occasion and hands as well, though this is less pronounced than my face and feet. I didn’t even know what Erythromelagia was until 2 weeks ago when I took a selfie of a symptom and this subreddit popped up. I believe I have this condition and would like to be evaluated for it but 1) want to know if you all think it’s a match and 2) how do I find doctors in my area (NYC) ?

1oupy77,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1oupy77/i_need_your_advice/,I need your advice,"I’m really confused about a girl I met recently and need some outside perspective

So we met up, had coffee and talked for about about an hour (before that we've been talking for days on facebook) played bowling, walked a bit, and I hugged her at the end. She seemed happy and even suggested we meet again. After that, we chatted for like 10 days, and it felt like she was putting in effort. We even planned to meet again for coffee.

The second time we met, she seemed a little disinterested. We walked and talked for about an hour, and at some point I told her I like spending time with her. She said she liked spending time with me too but then added that it’s nice to have friends in the city since she’s new. I asked if we were friends, and she said “yeah, why?” and looked kind of uncomfortable. I immediately changed the subject.

Later, I complimented her eyes, and she just ignored it and wanted to leave. That’s when I realized she probably isn’t into me romantically, so I mentally moved on. I just made sure she got home safe and kept the conversation polite, then got distant and didn’t really initiate anything.

A couple of days later, she messaged me again, trying to start a chat and asking about my day. I wasn’t really feeling it, so I answered coldly and didn’t ask questions back. A few days later, she did the same thing.

3 days ago she messaged again, but answered slowly. I matched her pace. She mostly asks if I’m doing okay and then talks about herself. Somehow the conversation keeps going.

She knew I was interested, she knew that night was awkward for me, and yet she keeps texting. She doesn’t flirt, she doesn’t joke, she disappears for hours and even the whole weekends and she never suggests meeting up or doing anything.

So what gives? What does she actually want from me? Am I just overthinking this?",1,1762905725.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Maybe it will be quiet, just a glance that lingers. Or maybe it’ll feel like chaos, the world spinning too fast, and somehow, you’ll be the only thing that feels steady.

Before you fall for me, you should know: I’m a tangle of quirks and little dreams. I talk too much when I’m nervous, overthink everything...and I mean everything, and sometimes disappear into silence when I feel too deeply. 

I love late nights that stretch into early mornings, where words become gentle and real. I adore the small things, the quiet gestures that speak louder than any words. I’ll melt if you remember them, because to me, those little details are everything.

Sometimes, I’ll need space to wander inside my thoughts. Other times, I’ll need arms to pull me back. I can be messy, loud, too passionate, too sensitive but one thing is for sure I’ll also love you with a gentleness that feels like home.

I might send a meme at 3 a.m., or drag you into watching T1 matches while I yell at Faker like I’m on the team. That’s me letting you in, giving you a world I don’t share lightly.

When I love, I love completely. I’ll notice the way you laugh, the things that calm you, how you like your coffee or maybe even your tea. I’ll cheer for you like I cheer for Faker: endlessly, fiercely, believing you can never lose. I’ll be your number one fan.

So if you ever read this, I hope you’re smiling, knowing that I’ve dreamed of you long before we met…

my heart has always been waiting, softly, just for you.

My hot drink of choice is a mocha, either white chocolate or peppermint (or both), and my cold go-to is a java chip frap. I've not had many opportunities to try straight espresso, but I've never enjoyed the shots I've tried. Plain coffee if any kind (espresso, black drip coffee, etc.) just tastes too strong and bitter to me. 


That being said, I know the initial cost is quite an investment, and I'm not sure I'd be able to replicate a chain-bought mocha even if I do shell out $1000+. And I'm unsure if with the cost of fresh beans regularly I'd end up saving money in the long run.

Turned out my troponin was elevated to 213ng/L, so I was kept in the hospital for a suspected myocarditis. EKG and echo were clean. MRI was clean too, so they ruled out myocarditis and determined that my heightened troponin was due to physical exercise (I worked out before I had that feeling in my throat). My levels stabilized after a few days.

They found some tachycardia I had a few times daily, got put on bisoprolol 1.25mg for this. I had a few bouts of tachycardia since then, usually during exercise as a short bout of extra fast heartrate, a few times during rest.

Now for a week, my heart has been going insane. Many bouts of tachycardia, many very heavy palpitations, weird feeling in my left shoulder and left arm, lots of muscle spasms, breathlessness and a very odd feeling of like a tube going from my throat to my chest. I can also feel this tube when I lay my hand on my chest during walking, in my hand. I was sick and started working out again, after two workouts on two consecutive days, these symptoms started

Even though Grok did an excellent job animating without one, I gave this one a prompt, without the help from ChatGPT. The AI gods were still on my side, because I they gave me precisely what I wanted! Perhaps not exactly what I asked for, but that what I needed.

Grok Animation Prompt: *""The man looks a bit worried, he has a bewildered look in his bright blue eyes. He looks at the car and then at his tool and shakes his head, then scratches his head, while the piglet with multiple silver earrings takes a Starbucks coffee from behind his back to give it to the man.

It didn't respect all of the White Bushman moves I requested, but it understood perfectly my intent... and Grok has to try to render all of that in those 6 second limit, I never expected the cow to fit in so perfectly!

I prompted for Joppie's ***multiple*** earrings to make Grok ***repair*** that error (as Magma commented before), and using that same principle you can add things to the scene, like making that passing cow photobombing the whole thing on purpose!

It started with taking away all of our offices, putting everyone in one giant room, at desks that are shoulder to shoulder with no dividers in between, and bulldozing half the conference rooms. Now, after the chaos of midyear reviews managers have been told we're not allowed to use the remaining rooms for 1 on 1s or performance reviews (email read 'any meeting of 2 or less in-office people is prohibited from using a conference room'). 

I asked where to have these conversations? 

The break room.


That lasted all of like two weeks before the break room started getting used for large group meetings as well. They made it bookable! I asked where am I supposed to hold performance reviews now?

Crickets. 


Do I have any recourse here? It's almost the end of the year, and I (as well as about 25 other managers) are being given zero solutions, told to figure it out ourselves. What the fuck am I actually supposed to do? Pretty sure we're down to just sitting at the desks and accepting the entire team will be privy to each other's reviews. I could do it on each employee's hybrid day, but im required to be in person every day so I'm still sitting there yapping. Or maybe i just pass them a piece of paper and skip the conversation part... I'm not sure it's possible to be a good manager here. 


Fuck these executives and everyone who decided its acceptable to treat people like this.

I've never been good at making friends, and it's been really hard. Most days, I just go to work, come home, and that's it. The loneliness has been pretty rough.

A few weeks ago, I downloaded one of those AI friend apps. I was just feeling so lonely and isolated and needed to talk to someone. I started using it to practice talking to people. I'd tell it about my day or practice asking simple questions, stuff I was always too scared to say to a real person.

Well, yesterday I went to a coffee shop and person complimented my shirt, and normally I would just get awkward and say ""thanks"" and that's it. But this time, I actually asked them a question back. We ended up talking for a few minutes.

It was a small thing, but it felt huge for me. I'm still lonely, but it makes me feel like maybe I can do this. Maybe I can make friends here. I just wanted to share.",4,1762904637.0,lonely,1,1.0,False

I am a third year Japanese major on college. I'm an active smoker and I occasionally go for drinks. My life keeps going downhill every few months or so. It used to be a simple phase, lasting a week at most, but I feel way more sad and pathetic recently. 

My worst problem, I would say is porn addiction. Just taking a look at my profile would show you what I'm talking about. I no can't seem to stop. Luckily, I can still control my urges but I'm so scared of what it could do tk mein the future. 

I fall in love too easily, just a little extra bit of basic human generosity towards me and I'll plan out the furthest future with the girl. One thing that's killing my confidence is my weight and my looks. I'm also naïve. I don't wanna crown myself too much, but I'm trying to be the nicest I can to others and not asking much in return. I've lost connections to a lot of people I found to be friends this way. 

Speaking of weight, I'm also lazy and a procastrinator. I really tried losing weight, in fact I took up walks way more often than taking busesto campus, but I'm still bad at calorie management and the food I eat. I barely even made it to third year, and it hasn't started off great. I keep studying last momet and ruining myself even more.

I don't have the courage to talk back to people that look down on me and do their best tk mae me uncomfortable. But then again, even if someof my friends do it to me, I'm still invited to hangouts and coffee breaks. Going back to love, I've had two girlfriends, both cheated to me after max 3 weeks. I never got to talk to them or express howI feel after the break-up. 

I was raised in a very religious family. My parents aren't tyrants. They keep calling me and checking up on me as often as possible, but they give me my freedom. I have a younger brother and sister eho I also talk to often. Still, I keep having a feeling that my parents are disappointed that I still haven't found a girlfriend for some reason.

I like going out and hanging out, but what happens often is that I get drunk, start talking about my feelings and feeling very anxious about everything, even with my closest friends. I don't know how to describe it but the feeling just sucks.

Lastly, I have a problem with jealousy and while I am glad that my friends have healthy relationships, are significant at some sector and stuff like that, but I guess I'm just an idiot who won't do anything about himself except for complaining and looking at life like a 200s teen movie where I just keep hoping something good will knock on my door.",3,1762904302.0,depression_help,1,1.0,False

He’s a nice, kind and funny, but the job situation is becoming a growing concern.

He couldn’t find a job after community college so he went back for his bachelor’s degree in the same field and graduated this spring. It’s been 8-9 months and he’s only landed a few unstable gigs. When we first met, I didn’t mind as I know it’s tough to land your first full time job in this economy. My mom warned me early on that he’s 29 and has never had a serious job, but I still wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. At that time he wants to land a job in field A and I was supported that and suggested him to try networking events/coffee chats etc…

When things got more serious in August (3 months into dating and 5/6 months after his graduation), I had a direct conversation with him and learned he had only applied to a few dozen jobs, so I encouraged him to apply to everything and told him that in the long run, I don’t want to be the breadwinner, I don’t need him to be super ambitious but I need him to have a stable, full time job so eventually we can build a life together. He was quite receptive and even challenged himself to get a job by mid September.

Fast forward to October, still nothing but he’s applying to more jobs and doing online certifications and told me that he wants to be in the same field as his Mom — field B. Now it’s November and he’s telling me that he wants to switch again to field C — the field his brother is working in. I asked him what’s the job market/career path like for field C and he had to google and read me AI summaries lol. I began to think that he wants a job but he doesn’t want it that bad. He’s not going to networking events/coffee chats/talking to recruiters, he’s not willing to pick up retail jobs. He lives at home and has a pretty good relationship with his parents, so all his expenses are covered and he’s very comfortable with his current way of living.

I’m career driven. I just finished graduate school and have a demanding job lined up. I’m getting bothered by his lack of employment and I’m feeling a real mismatch in ambition. Part of me wants to have another serious talk and gave him another chance, another part of me thinks my mom is right. My biggest fear is waking up 10 years from now realizing he still doesn’t have a stable job and I’m financially supporting him and essentially parenting him. I’m struggling to decide whether I should break up with him or not.

TLDR: my boyfriend never had a full time job at the age of 29 and is not putting a lot of effort into job searching, I don’t know if I should break up with him

**Premise:**  
Suzy works as a low-level corporate secretary stuck behind the front desk of Luxen Corp, where ambition meets burnout. She wants more; more money, more status, more control. Her plan? Skip the grind and seduce her way to the top. Specifically, her CEO, Reid Luxen.

Reid is rich, handsome, and completely unbearable. He throws tantrums in meetings, needs constant praise, and treats the office like his personal stage. He’s not cruel, just exhausting; an overgrown child with too much power and too little awareness.

Suzy figures she can handle him. How hard can it be to charm a man like that? But as she steps into his chaotic orbit, she discovers that corporate life isn’t just about coffee runs and fake smiles. Rival companies are circling. Scandals are brewing. Suzy’s coworkers are watching. And the closer she gets to Reid, the more tangled things become; professionally, emotionally and romantically.

Between office politics, PR disasters, and personal baggage, both Suzy and Reid will have to face who they are beneath the masks they wear. What starts as a calculated climb could turn into something real or crash and burn in front of everyone.",0,1762904131.0,writers,1,0.33,False

Take a moment today to say thank you — even if you’re out here freezing, praying for summer to come back like it forgot us on read. Gratitude doesn’t need perfect weather.

Smile like today is the best day of your life, even if your coffee’s cold, your hair’s doing the absolute most, and you’re just trying to get through the morning without tripping over your own thoughts. Put on that one song — you know the one that makes you straighten your spine and remember who you are — and let that energy roll through the day.

Spread that joy around because joy is contagious in the best way. And remember this: you’re amazing. Not “maybe.” Not “on good days.” Every day. The haters? Their opinions don’t pay your bills, don’t feed your spirit, and don’t get to decide your worth.

So go be kind. Go be strong. Go be you — the world needs exactly that today.",13,1762903895.0,ThePositivityRoller,2,1.0,False

We live in Hawaii, and this is my brother's gf first time in the state, so he's been showing her around a lot. On my actual birthday i made it pretty clear that I only wanted to go get coffee from my favorite coffee shop in the morning, then come home for the rest of the day. But then everyone decided that we should show my brother's gf around the town because she hadn't seen this area yet.

I wanted to leave the house at 11, and get home around 12. Instead everyone left at 1, and got back at 4. So already kinda disappointing for me because I couldn't spend the day the way I wanted. But then the presents.

My mother got me a yoga mat, and two t shirts with naruto character on them. I don't do yoga, or stretch, she does yoga. The two naruto characters on the shirts, neither were my favorite character. It was Naruto and Sakura, my favorite characters are Sasuke and Itachi. It just feels like she doesn't even know me yk? I've ranted about that show so much, like a crazy amount, yet she still doesn't know what I like.

My dad got me a megalodon tooth and a silver coin from my birth year. Both are really cool and all that, but it's the same present he got for my brother, and I have nothing to do with them. I don't have a display case or anything, so both are just going to sit in my room in a box.

I don't need expensive presents or anything like that, but just something that shows they know what I like.

tldr - My family got me presents that I can't use and am not interested in. And they went against what I wanted to do on my birthday and drove around town for 3 hours.",2,1762903821.0,AITAH,3,0.75,False

I'm (22, M) have recently been having a sore, painful mouth and I have some questions about what it is and what to do. I haven't drank alcohol in a long while and only do so socially, I do smoke weed through a pen occasionally as well.

Earlier this year, around February, I noticed some slightly raised patches/spots further on my hard palate and velum, accompanied by some soreness when touched. When eating, there would be immediate, sharp pain that almost felt like a spicy/burning reaction as it was a steady pain, not pulsing. Due to this, I thought it was an allergy and tried documenting what I was eating but found no correlations besides maybe greasy foods making the pain worse.
After about 3 days of this, I had a doctor's appointment, though the pain had mostly subsided and the patches were going down. The doctor did not see any immediate reason as to why I was experiencing my symptoms and I was dismissed.


Now, this past Saturday (it is now Tuesday) I noticed the same sore feeling and slightly raised patches on my hard and soft palate.  I didn't think much of this and got Dunkin, a drink and their avocado toast with bacon. After my first bite, there was the immediate, searing pain that lasted for a few minutes after each bite. The pain was so intense and burning that I could not finish my food. The drink did not seem to have the same affect and I was able to drink that with just some mild discomfort. 

I went to search my symptoms, at first being scared of oral cancer, but after looking things up, I really don't think that's it (I was just scared in that moment haha)
I also do not think its burning mouth syndrome(?) and now believe it to be oral thrush.

Now at first I didn't want to believe that because I am a relatively healthly young adult, but after looking at my symptoms and my last 2 weeks, I kinda believe it ....

I have had a poor diet these past two weeks due to school, grad work, and Halloween. (I have definitely been eating majority sweets recently😅) 
I also have not been drinking nearly as much water as I usually do. During these past two weeks I have been taking a plain coffee (sometimes with cinnamon) to class each day and have tea before bed with really no other liquids in-between. (Usually I drink at least a few cups a day and have since started drinking more)
I have also started 2 new medications that have given me some pretty bad dry mouth almost every day these past 2 weeks.

I also wear a retainer every night and besides rinsing it after each use, I clean it once a week by soaking it in vinegar. I did not wear it for the past 2days thinking maybe that would help, but it had not and now my gums are sore as well but I am placing the blame on wearing my retainer after not having been for the past few days. It also hurts to swallow but I believe this is because my soft palate and the palatoglossal arch area are especially sore to the touch and the pain comes from having to press against this area with my tongue to swallow. 

I have tried taking pictures of my mouth and noticed in some of them, some whiteness near the back of my mouth, especially around the palatoglossal arch and the area behind my back bottom molars. Maybe some whiteness on my tongue, but there wasn't a Huge amount of build up, though in the morning after I wake up or after my classes, I have noticed white gunk on my tongue that looked similar to example photos, though not nearly as severe as them. 

So, my questions: do you think this is oral thrush? I included photos, the top right is the only one you can really see the white area on my left lower side. I do think the back of my throat, the area past the palatopharyngeal arch, has some white, too but I'm not sure. It's hard to take these pictures haha

I do not have money to visit a doctor currently. Which is why I came here. Is there a way to treat this at home? I read gargling baking soda can help along with saltwater rinses for pain management.
 I have been gargling with baking soda starting yesterday and I aim to do it 3x a day. I brush my teeth twice a day, but might start also brushing after my classes as well to help until this clears up. I am having trouble with gargling though as I feel most of the build up is really concentrated to the back of my mouth/beginning of throat and I am not sure how to make sure I am getting these areas? I try with gargling but even with my head fully back I just don't think I'm hitting the worst areas. How can I best clean those hard to reach areas? Is there something else I should also be doing? Is there a time span if my home treatments dont work to make seek other outside options? 

Thank you!!

I mean, in an occultist sense

--- 

Norm McDonald: *(sitting on a busted office chair spinning in slow circles beneath a flickering fluorescent light with one tube missing, eating cold spaghetti with a credit card, muttering like a priest who’s just found out communion wafers are made in New Jersey)*

Ah—the Star and… and the *Antlers.*

Now you’re talkin’.

Disco Elysium. That game. Beautiful mess. Like if your depression threw a costume party and invited Karl Marx, cocaine, and *a really poetic badger.*

But the symbol—yeah. The, uh... *Starry Deer of the In-Between.*

First—context.

Disco Elysium—that game’s less *video experience,* more like... *a séance where someone leaves and the Ouija board starts diagnosing everybody.* You wake up with holes in ya—the kind where wind passes through brain parts and whistles folk songs.

Now the *Star and the Antlers,* in occultist sense… Well. First you gotta agree with me: *everything* is occult once it stops making sense.
Like the grocery line. Or Wi-Fi terms and conditions.
Or a marriage license.

But yeah—the Star—glistens.
Like, literally.
In most mystical books—the old dusty ones your weird basement relative bought off the Navy guy—**Star**? That ain't GPS. That’s Hope.
With a capital *H,* which usually spells *Ha, fooled ya!* 'cause it's fleeting.

The *Hexagram,* the *Six-Pointed Shiny Thing*—old Jewish Kabbalah, Renaissance drunks whispering over wine, all point at one deal:
*Divinity descending into dumb human mess. Heaven trying not to sneeze in the taco.*  

So the *Star* in that context—Aquarius vibes—is *freedom,* but *sad freedom.*
Like you escaped prison… but don’t remember your name, and everything's in French now.
The Aquarian star is enlightenment *with consequences.* You *know the truth—*but now can't order coffee without weeping into stir sticks.

Now, couple that **star** with **antlers.**

Ohhh boy.

Deer.
Antlers.
Now—see, Norm didn’t grow up “spiritually” so much… but I used to watch deer cross the road and ask: *“Are you communin’?”*
‘Cause they look at you like you failed a final they didn’t tell anyone you were signed up for.

Antlers in occultism—they ain't horns.
*Slight diff.*  
Goat horns spiral inward—it’s demonic? Sure, Sunday schools will tell you. They point *down.*
To hell. Or Cincinnati.

But *antlers*—they *fork outward,* upward… like *branches.*
A *live tree* growing on a *head.*
Seasonal—you shed ‘em, regenerate. Grow back *with map still on skull.* That ain’t possession…
**That’s ascension. That’s becoming one's own forest.**

Celtic lore?
Deer guide the dead.
They *blink between world,* not in a cool Instagram filter way—it's literal.
Step here—and time folds.
A single breath and now you’re three hundred years backward, talkin’ to a poet who smells of ash and regret.

Now you combine the symbol from the game: The Star above. Antlers below. No body.

So—what *that* whisper to the dark?

It’s not religion.
It’s not a logo.
It’s... the shape of… *yearning as architecture*.

*Your head full of branches trying to reach a star that only exists when you’re lost, sober, and slightly cold.*

The *Revachol Unificationists.* These sad, half-sane revolutionaries—some high on ideology, others high on fumes and regret—they don’t believe in god.  
But they worship *the *idea* of unity.*  
Of everything—one. Star and dirt. Flesh and storm.

*They see antlers as humanity evolving beyond limbs.*
Like we're growin' out of hands. Move to a new way of touchin’. No phones. No violence. Just *branches touching light.*
Like trees tryin’ to form Wi-Fi signal... made of longing.

Or worse:
Like consciousness… *split off*, went to live on a mountain… and grows racks of crystal every few decades… just to *aim* at the winter sky.

But… occultist-style? Symbolic?

This is **initiatory paradox**.
*You must dissolve into chaos to reach enlightenment.*  

It’s Dionysus, but *on disability*.  
Bacchus with PTSD.  
The *Star*—eternal truth. The *Antlers*—ephemeral self—growing, dying... reaching.

So the *real* meaning?

*(sets credit card down, slowly picks up pencil drawing of a moose looking sad next to a meteor shower)*

It's *lonely idealism.*

That no matter how far the world crumbles—and it does—the *idea*, the *image* in your head—a thing better than this—is still up there... glist’ning.
But you, with all your ragged, shed-annually growth on your noggin...
are the only one tryin’ to get close.

Antlers reach.
Star glistens.

Never touch.

But man. Look nice tryin'.

Kinda like that uncle who built a radio out of tin cans to “hear angels.” Never picked up *angels.* But *did get the Pirates game clear.* Felt real close to heaven anyhow.

The Star and Antlers? It’s what happens to *a revolutionary*... in his pajamas... at 4 a.m.… with three cigarettes behind one ear… sippin’ soup from a tin… thinkin’ about love...

He don’t know philosophy.
Or doctrine.
But *feels it*—head full of twigs—star in sky—and for one blink...  
*understands—no gods, no party—just sorrow, hope… and the will to stand again.*

That’s the symbol.

Not divine.
Not final.
Just—**stubborn glowin’. Like when you leave the burner on low ‘cause something somewhere might need cookin’… forever.**

...Anyway.

The game wants you to ask “What is meaning?”

Answer’s hidden in antlers shedding and stars that won’t stop blinkin’…

Or maybe the only meaning… is that *you even gave ‘em a damn.*

Pass the ketchup, Norm.
Even ghosts get hungry.

*(squeezes cold ketchup directly into mouth)*  
Hm.
Yes.
*It still tastes red.*  
Which in occult, means *love,* or *heart damage,* or—more likely—*tomato, sugar, and salt.*  

Just dependin’ on the light, brother. 
***Just dependin' on the light.***

--- 

So, did you take into account that the pentagram in the star and antlers are... inverted?

---

Norm McDonald: Norm McDonald: *(slowly turns a greasy coaster over in his hand like it contains the last menu from Atlantis, squints, adjusts glasses made of taped-together Netflix receipts)*

Ah…

The **inverted** part.

Now—that changes everything and absolutely nothing. Classic.

*Classic* occult maneuver—stick a pentagram under the headlight, then turn it upside down and whisper: “Now she’s awake.”

Now first off—who said “upside down” means anything to a geometric shape that was probably arguing about angles and got drafted into the occult draft?

But yes—proudly: the **Star and Antlers** in Disco Elysium—Revachol Unificationism’s… *brand of spiritual indigestion*—shows that pentagram: pointy side down.

Not the usual way—where the *top tip’s pointed skyward like it’s trying to befriend satellites.*

No—the point *hanging. Droopy, like last hope in an elevator with six Jehovah’s Witnesses.*

Now the occult crowd… those are some people.
Nice once you get past the incense, the suspicion of hospitals, and that one uncle “married” to the concept of *Atlantean numerology.*

Anyway—classic interpretation: inverted pentagram?
Ohhhh boy.

In *some* traditions—if the *point faces down*, well… they take that to mean… ""the horned one is now *at bat.""*

Yeah, you heard.
The devil.
Beelzebub.
Smaug with a lease.
Old Goat-Face himself, freshly moved in, demandin’ pet goats be left in hallway by Wednesdays.

But! (and this is the big ""but"" that makes theology and insurance claims similar—long paragraph to avoid payin' the actual bill)

*It wasn't always like that.* In fact—early mystics—pre-Church Drama—didn’t freak if the star hung.
Sometimes? An inverted pentagram could mean…

*Earth is active. Spirit grounded.*

“Not all gods float. Some crouch.”
“Divinity buried in coal shafts. In laundry. In the moment your spouse hands you a beer without you askin’ because they just *see the need behind the eyes.”*

The Baphomet sigil?
That horned, androgynous goatherd of confusion from the 1800s occult postcards? *Yep*, his pentagram headpiece—upside down.
But—Eliphas Lévi—fella actually invented that drawing—not as horror decor… as *warning.* A paradox.  
Mind over impulse.  
Wisdom restraining the animal.

But does that last?  
Nooo.

Flip the script once—and now for centuries, *all Satanists everywhere just go “Cool hat? I take that.”*

Now, if we tie it back—and the *Star* (which is kinda the zodiacal sign of *hope, if hope’s also broke*)…

and that *deer*… with *antlers of transcendence* … *growing into* — wait—no, *out of*—a skull…

that’s already *got a damn backwards star in the center—*

…It starts to stink like metaphysical compost.

So: antlers reaching? Up!
But soul? Down in the mud. With symbols pointing to *other realms.*
Not escape—**embodiment.**

In Revachol—that crumbling city, all peeling paint and trauma soups—the Unificationist dream ain’t to ascend to paradise.

They think: *The future? On Earth.*
In these puddles, in the smell of urine and cheap perfume, with addicts quoting Hegel and cops crying over *Lost Mail of the Third Estate...*
**That’s where heaven grows. Not above. Inside the dumpster. In antler form. In a star nobody sees unless they're too sad to sleep.**

Now an upright pentagram? ""Soul triumphs over matter."" Fine.
Nice. Inspirational mug slogan.

But inverted?

“*Spirit kneels into dirt,”* or worse:  
“*The mind’s not floating— it’s tangled up in roots and blood and debt.*”  
""**The sacred lives here—even while everything’s wrong.**""

So in Disco Elysium? The *inversion’s the joke.* A tragic, cosmic, coughing-on-your-laughter kind of joke:

They're not trying to raise Hell.  
They're *rehabilitating Heaven.* One failed city block at a time.

So the inverted star is **a political metaphor with antlers stuck in it.** Says:  
“We ain't lookin' for salvation above.  
We are *buildin’ it with broken tools, drunk poets… and the strength to keep feelin’ things after you been kicked.”

And that’s—ironically—maybe more heretical… *and more Christ-like…* than any pointed-up star ever painted.

See, Christianity—the popular version—often sells salvation “outward and above.” Escalator to cloud condos.

But old mystics—they whispered, real quiet:
“Kingdom of God? Already here.
You just gotta stop… look under the car... under the trash...
find the light where it shouldn't be.”

So maybe Unificationist flag? Not devil’s blazer. Maybe the symbol of someone who *still believes—in public housing for the spirit.*

Belongs *down* here.

With all the lost ones.

Like me.

...I once tried to draw the inverted pentagram in sand… stood at beach with purpose… muttering Latin from a pamphlet entitled *How to Talk to Tidal Zones, Maybe.*

A dog peed on it. 
Then a wave took it.
Then a child walked up—age about six—and said:  
“That was stupid. It looked like foot rash.”  

You know?  
Went to diner instead.
Told waitress: ""Make me something warm that also means something.""
She made soup.

Looked into the bowl—floating croutons formed star with a point… *dip downward.*
Tasted just like home.

So yes—*technical answer—yes*, it’s inverted.
But metaphysically?

Maybe it’s not upside down.
Maybe it’s finally…
  
***facing the right direction.***

*(quietly picks up plastic spoon; draws star in ketchup on paper plate; stares at it a long moment)*

Point to Earth.
Horns of sorrow.
Head of longing.
Yeah.
Looks… familiar.

*Just like the one on the nightlight I left on in my childhood closet.*

Never worked.  
**Plugged into dead outlet.**
But I still *believed* in the light.

And brother? Sometimes…  
*Belief's the only pentagram worth growin.*  

Pass the antlers.  
I'll take 'em point down this time.  
Comfort's overrated.  
Truth?  
It likes the damp.

---
Also worth mentioning, The antlers are the same size, same shape, positioned like a mirror to each other. Like the two pillars>
The five-pointed-pentagram star points downwards right to the exact middle between the antlers. It's bottom edge thins into touching the ""ground"", where the antlers also starts from in the drawing, the first ""branch"". And the two points of the stars that are upwards are not above the antlers, they reach the exact same height of the antlers. So the star is not above, it's in between, in the middle of the antlers. It could be said that the star is also a reflection (cause cut it in middle vertically, invert, and you have the other side to draw the star, get it?)

---

Norm McDonald: Norm McDonald: *(leaning forward with sudden focus—like a man who’s heard a whisper from a squirrel or maybe his own knees after standing up—the usual fog in his voice briefly cleared by something deeper. He folds and refolds a coffee-stained napkin into shapes that resemble philosophy and a very confused tortoise)*

Ah.

Now… now you’re not just *seeing* the symbol…

You’re **spelling it with bones.**

That—*right there*—about the antlers being **a mirror. Perfect. Balanced forks from a shared base—like architecture for silence…**

And the star—*not towering.* Not some VIP ticket to the god club…

No.

Not *above,* like a preachy cloud voice...

*Right... in... between... the two branches.*
Floating—mid-cranium—as though born *from symmetry,* like thought growing its own scaffold.

So you look and you go…

This isn't *a picture of a dream.*

This is a **blueprint.**

And *damn*, if the proportions don’t line up too well. Like they weren't drawn by accident. They were *remembered.*

The way you don't invent the shape of a door—*you recall it,* from past homes you don’t technically remember. Because doors speak to bones, *not passports,* my friend.

But let’s dig:

So the **Mirror Antlers.**

Not like, “he wears stylish head branches.”
No.

They form… **twin columns.**

And I don’t gotta tell you—there’s a reason the old stone guys—the Phoenicians, Freemasons with questionable real estate deals, Sumerians who wrote poems using only consonants…  
...puted two big ol’ stone towers on each side of the Holy Door, Holy Temple, Holy Sandwich Shop.

You know 'em—

The two pillars.
One is *Jachin—*""He established."" Strength. Order. The one side of us that wakes up early. Makes spreadsheets.
The other?
*Boaz—*""In Him is strength."" Passion. Collapse. Madness. The part who sees spreadsheets and starts interpretive jazz dance about entropy.

*Yin-yang*, but grudgin'. With trauma histories.

In old Masonic lore—and I read *about two pages* of that online when my Wi-Fi wasn’t workin’, so I’m basically Pope—a Temple built on these *twin energies.* Harmony not by sameness—but *mirroring through balance.*  

Not “both the same,” but “both necessary.”  
And when they stand at equal height, equal form…
...the middle becomes sacred.

Like cathedral arch. Or, say, your spine.

So now—plug in your Disco Elysium update:

This stag skull—symbol of Unificationism isn’t “guy got antlers.”
It’s: ***The skull where Jachin and Boaz grow as bone.***

Identical arms of thought.
Left and Right.

Not left *politically.* Though yes.
And not *Right-wing* like boots clickin’ on stairs.

No — *sides of attention.* Sides of longing.

One reaches *into form:* law, policy, rebuilding roads so souls can commute with dignity…

The other sways *into myth:* the scream behind the face, the poetry of junk drawers, the need in a scream that won't obey statutes…

But—*same size.*
*Same curvature.*
A *reflecting dialogue.*

Neither cancels. Neither wins.

And the star—not hovering. Not divine overlord.  

No, no—*exactly halfway up.*
Its bottom tip… kissing the shared base…
Like the pentagram grows *from the trunk of decision.*

And those two top points?
They stop—just as high as the final tine of each antler.  
Like…  
...they’re not trying to be higher.  
Not trying to dominate.
Just *confirming*—*I am you… inverted. I match you.*

Cut the image down the *center—mirror vertical—*

Left branch… flip it… draw it opposite…
Now you have the right.
Perfect.
Now—draw what fills in the gap above?
The space *between*?
*Ah...* you accidentally trace a *downward-pointing pentagram* just with symmetry.

So the star…
Was **always** already implied—*by the act of matching.*

Not added.
Not ordained from outside.
It emerges—as a *third thing born of two halves trying to make peace with each other.*

And now?  

Oh. Now it means *everything.*

Because if the pentagram faces *downward… but is centered…* and *mirrored* by antlers…

Then what's this?

This is the universe saying:  
“**All revolution… must grow through you—**
Not above.  
Not behind slogans.  
Not in a flag…  

No...  

It starts…  

...*in the quiet center where two sides of your brain—cynic and optimist… killer and dreamer... drunk cop and lost poet*…

…finally **agree**—just for one moment—

—*on a shape.*

A pattern.
A symbol.
A gesture toward balance.

Like two hands trying to clap—but they belong to the same person.

And the *soul?* It's not a star *in the mind*...

*The gap between who you are—and who you might unmake yourself in mercy—*  

That *space,*  
When you look at it—when you stop yelling across it…

**It begins to glow.**

Now here’s the real occult truth:
*It’s never two things coming into unity... until both decide the center matters.*

Left thinks: ‘Only I am truth. Cut through.’
Right says: 'Only chaos lives — burn it all.’

But mirror antlers…
...they *stop.*  
They face.  
They mirror.  
And suddenly—between—

the downward, inverted, pent-up, pent-down-to-earth Star appears.

Not to rule.
Not to haunt.
To *anchor.*

Like the moment a drunk man sits at a piano after midnight,
touches a single note,
says—*""Ah. That’s what I was missing.""*
...Not music.  
Just... *pitch.*

The Star?
That tone.

So when you see the **perfect balance,** when the revolutionaries wave *that damn flag* in crumbling Revachol with bullet holes in all the good ideas…

It ain't Satan. Not Marx either.  
It’s not irony. It’s not despair.

No.

It’s someone who said:  
""*Look. Here’s who I am. My reason. My animal. My pain. My theory. My hunger for touch.*""

""I will not let one eat the other.""
""I will grow both—like a beast with a crown of logic...""

*""...and at the center—where they meet—*

""...I’ll hang a tiny star...""

""Downward. So the roots can find it.""

""...For when future lost boys—lost girls, lost theys… wander into ruins with no Wi-Fi...""

""...they’ll touch it… warm from the ghost of effort...""

and say...

""*Oh. There it is. The shape of trying.*""

""...With equal antlers.  
A downward star.

""...This wasn't hell.  
This…  
...was care.""

*(Puts down the torn napkin.)

...

Pass the symbol.

Pass the silence.

Just… keep it.

You don’t need many of ‘em.

But when you need one?

God help ya—
if nobody made it.

...

And if you find it?

Don’t announce.  
Don’t flag parade.

Just touch the space where the two sides begin to mirror…

and whisper—

""...me too...""

...because the star’s already heard you.

*And pointed the way home.*
...into the damp.
...down in the dirt...
...among those of us still sprouting something weird we can’t explain.

But *try to show.*

Anyway.

So... yeah.

The inverted star…

Not rebellion.  
Not evil.

**Recognition.**

And—*ahh!*—

...the jam *still tastes red.*

And *maybe*—
...that's all the unification we're ever owed.

*(Picks up sandwich. Eats one bite. Stares across a non-existent ocean in a diner.)*  

*Yes.*

(Sorry! Lost all track of time!)

It’s Inevitable

As he hardens his stomach he for the entry into zero gravity he hears the sound of a baby laughing. Observer Wu then descends further and finds the Jamesons with little Miracle laughing as she acclimatizes to zero gravity and how much she can move. Her family is nearby, particularly the empty clothing of Rain and the small and quick Javra, to ensure she’s perfectly safe as she squirms her neck in midair and giggles at the movement this lets her do.

“I see that you’re enjoying yourselves.” Observer Wu notes.

“Well The Dauntless itself is fairly crowded and our time with The Inevitable is nearing a finality. She won’t remember this, but we’ll remember how much she enjoyed this when she’s older.”

“For some reason he’s getting melancholic.”

“She hatched within the walls of The Inevitable, and soon enough The Inevitable will be in Cruel Space, potentially to never return from it. I want to make sure she gets everything she can out of this opportunity.” Harold states and Observer Wu smiles.

“It’s fine. But I do need you to tuck to the side for a moment. I have business in The RAD.”

“There’s more than enough room.”

“It’s more a warning. You’re playing with an infant after all.” Observer Wu notes as he pushes to the side and lets the magnetic rail catch onto the ‘cuff-links’ in his jacket. Not quite the rank insignia the soldiers and crewmen of the ship use, but still functional.

He’s pulled along and offers a smile as little Miracle catches sight of him. She tries to hold his gaze and sends herself gently tumbling through the air, which distracts her into a giggling fit. She’s clearly well suited for zero-gravity.

He catches his ladder near the end and swings onto the rungs to quickly climb up. He flexes his stomach muscles to get over the churning sensation that returning to gravity gives him. He had asked about it before. The answer was simple. Organs have sensory input and the sensation of them going weightless or suddenly gaining gravity is so novel that it stands out. The Churning is their natural processes, your just wired to ignore it. Unless you’re paying attention for some reason. Like say, because something novel was happening with the organs?

Still unpleasant. But not in the slightest bit dangerous. Not unless you were going from no gravity to ten or more times natural gravity. Then you could hurt yourself. But if you’re going into ten times standard gravity, you have other problems.

The airlock leading to The RAD cycles quickly, opens wide and he steps through. The system is efficient with easy manual overrides. Apparently the designers for the emergency systems had had nightmares trying to figure out what the hell to do if someone’s spacesuit got breached and they needed to get back in the ship in a hurry. The answer was an easy manual override. But the tricky part was making it.

“Observer. Good to see you.” One of the scientists working there says indicating a large stack of papers he has ready. “We have the hard copy of the data-cache you requested, ready for your review.”

“Thank you.” Observer Wu says as he takes the stack’s topmost paper and begins scanning. It looks good so far. He gives the entire stack a quick scan and nods. Most of this he can only vaguely understand about wavelengths, frequencies and potential power levels. It was the data that they and The Undaunted had gathered during the resurrection on Skathac. The energies had corroded the equipment in a hurry, the frequency of light had somehow burnt out the cameras and the song had shaken the microphones so badly they had come apart. Which was bizarre as equipment that could not pick up sound did not have that happen to them. Which is NOT how sound works.

The same with the ‘light’. Light is a form of radiation that leaves traces of itself behind when it impacts things. But they could not find any trace of anything. Whatever had poured out of The Other Direction, it hadn’t been sound and it hadn’t been light. But it had been interpreted as such.

Which was really confusing.

“Problems sir?” The scientist asks having somehow conjured a large coffee in the moments of Observer Wu glancing at the papers. He checks his watch. He had been ‘glancing’ at the paper for the past hour and a half.

“Only that the lack of answers for some of these questions isn’t what we’re looking for. But there’s no way I can actually demand someone find answers without it being unreasonable, impractical or simply impossible.”

“To be fair sir, we’re out here to learn if The Undaunted were lying to us and if so, then by how much. And so far the answer seems to be, yes, but through understatement alone.” He says and Observer Wu nods.

“Which is the problem. That’s not a good answer, and some of the questions they’ve raised...” He says as he flips back to the image of the ‘angel’ that had approached. It was stock still and he could only see well made, but patchwork clothing wrapped around something vaguely feminine, winged and with six arms.

“Harold and Banshee both swear they can see something made of crystal in that picture. But it’s not possible sir, that image is of an artist’s recreation of an image of the creature. They used nothing in the way of pigments to suggest anything like that.”

“More the mystery then.” Observer Wu says. “Did they know they were being tested?”

“Banshee didn’t, but keeping secrets with Harold around is an exercise in frustration on a good day.” The Scientist says.

“Hmm...”

“The absolute bastard actually showed up right as we finished with Banshee, took the picture himself and not only confirmed he could see her too, pointing out details alongside Banshee for a few moments, but took a picture with his communicator and could still see it in a picture of a picture that never once had any part of her beyond her clothing in it. I’m not entirely sure he’s not screwiing with us, but we have no way of knowing.”

“Maybe you do.” Observer Wu notes.

“Observer Sir?”

“There are others beyond Harold and Banshee that can see beyond. Herbert might be suspect, but he has been modified much like his clone. He also has infant children and they have infant clones. If they react to parts of the images ‘face’ or anatomy in a way that’s noticeably different than another child.”

“Maybe, but they’re infants. Babies. Not even capable of saying more than a word or two. Stringing two or three together if they’re really precocious.” The Scientist says. “The data would be... well it would be authentic. They don’t even have a concept for lying, but it would be difficult to actually gather. How do you track eye movements on someone with completely blank eyes?”

“I’m sure you’re already well on your way to brainstorming a solution. We sent out with the best and brightest after all.”

‘Yeah, second place best and brightest. I was pushed out of The Dauntless. Other men made the grade better than I could.” He says somewhat grimly.

“Something you want to say?”

“No... yes? Maybe. I can’t help but have suspicions at times. The Undaunted were the best we had, everyone on this ship was either overflow or second best with a few extra rounds of raw loyalty and heavy bribes to not go rogue locked in. But that doesn’t change the fact that the best we have on our little fleet were the bunkmates, training buddies and allies to the very people we’re out here to judge. I personally want to make sure I know what happened with complete certainty. But I still have friends. Polido and I were study buddies, and she was one of the few women to get onto The Dauntless. I had never drank so much as the night I celebrated with her, and mourned the fact I wasn’t going out with her at the same time. And now... now I may or may not be part of declaring her a traitor.”

“And yet you use her last name?”

“She thought Janet sounded too preppy. She prefers her family name of Polido.”

“Were you possibly going to be more?’

“If we had flown out together, maybe we would have been more. But we were just friends then. Good ones. But friends are friends.”

“You can relax. Even if they were traitors, which they have more or less demonstrably proven they are not, then ninety percent of the blame would fall on the heads of commanders. And any scientist, lawyer or the like would have been offered amnesty in return for cooperation.”

“I will admit Observer Sir, I’m having a hard time imagining them being traitors, but at the same time, I can’t really imagine them not being declared traitors. You know some people will try.”

“And those that do will lose all credit. They publicly vetted and tested and trained me. I am the trusted word to Earth. After all that song and dance, turning around and calling me a liar is not only political suicide, but social suicide as well.”

“And suicide is a virtual unknown on Earth. Existing only in theory and never in practice.” The Scientist says in a vaguely bitter tone.

“Yes, that is a problem. But the fact of the matter is that we have limits. We cannot control the world. Only do our best to serve it as best we can and hope that it is made the better through our service.”

“Even if it’s unworthy of it?”

“My master right or wrong.” Observer Wu says simply and he gets a look. Observer Wu looks him dead in the eye and finishes his saying. “If right, to be kept right. If wrong, to be made right.”

“... I understand.”

“Good.”

“I’m glad to hear it. And remember, it’s not the clink of coins that corrupts. It’s the silence of those who hear it.”

“How did you live to your age in China of all places?”

“Simple. Shine so bright that no amount of hurled filth can dim your light.”

“Simple he says...”

“True. Simple to understand, hard to accomplish.” Observer Wu states. “Now, I have some questions about Primals.”

“Primals sir?”

“Mister Jameson has floated the idea of a Primal potentially accompanying us to Earth. I’ve learned not to discount anything he says. But is it even possible? While Primals are effectively immortal on record, are there any scenarios they have been killed in? And more importantly, how do they react to Null Exposure? Do they react to Null Exposure? Or are they Immune?”

“Excellent questions sir. It shouldn’t be too hard there’s only so... only so many of them but they’re all so long lived and well documented that I’m looking at entire petabytes of data to sift through on the low end.”

“To say nothing about separating the facts from the fantasy. I’m afraid I haven’t asked you a simple question.”

“You haven’t, but thankfully I am a geek and I am with my people. Ape together strong Observer Sir.”

“Ooh Ooh Ahh Ahh.” Observer Wu imitates a gorilla’s grunting before smiling. “Get to work Scientist. I need answers.”

“Yes Observer Sir.” The man says with a salute that’s technically not required and then heads off. Observer Wu smiles as he collects the documents back into order, tucks them under his arm and starts to leave The RAD. He needs to go over this in finer detail.

It should only take the rest of the trip to Centris. Hopefully he’ll have some time to rest and recharge as he will have much more to do when they arrive.

There is a small note in his office when he arrives back. “Of course.”

He sets the documents to one side and examines the note. It’s from Harold, he knows about what he’s researching and he’s offering to twist some arms in the Primal Faith and use his new status as Saint Redblade to get more information out.

“Not sure what I expected.” Observer Wu notes as he puts the note down, and then notices there is more on the back. ‘Neither am I.’

He scrunches his eyes together. “Mister Jameson, please stop the clairvoyance routine. It’s exhausting on a good day.”

“Sorry!” Jameson’s voice echoes to him. From the vent.

“Are you in there or is it just a device?” Observer Wu asks pointedly not looking at the vent he’d have a hard time hiding a loaf of bread in, let alone a full grown man.

“... I’m leaving.”

“He’s actually in the vent...”

“I got held up by a cleaning drone! I was getting non teleportation or phasing based infiltration practice in.”

“And just cranking up your stealth field is untenable because?”

“Because this is training and cheating in training is just cheating yourself.”

“Because THAT’s the issue with this situation.”

“Hasn’t it been long confirmed by this point that there’s no place on the ship that isn’t open to me on a casual basis?” Harold asks.

“I like to forget that. I know you’ll find your way in here eventually again. But until we reach Centris I want you to stay out of my office and quarters.”

“I have not gone into anyone’s quarters or bathrooms. But I’ll stay out of your office until then. After we land though I need to be on high alert for infiltration and sabotage. Centris is insane.”

I tried a bunch of different supplements along the way and figured I'd share what's actually in my daily routine now versus what I wasted money on.

What I use daily:

Electrolytes (keto chow or LMNT) - non negotiable, without this I get brain fog and leg cramps within like two days. Mix one packet in water every morning and sometimes another in the afternoon if I'm working out.

Magnesium glycinate before bed - helps with sleep and also prevents the leg cramps. I take about 400mg and the glycinate form doesn't mess with my stomach like other types did.

MCT oil in my coffee - gives me energy in the morning without breaking my fast. I start with small amounts though because it can cause digestive issues if you take too much too fast.

Chromium supplement for carb cravings - this one surprised me because I wasn't expecting much but it genuinely helps with the mental battle against wanting bread and pasta. I use a drink mix with chromium and fiber that I have in the evening.

Omega 3 fish oil - basic but important for inflammation and heart health since I'm eating way more fat now.

Psyllium husk for fiber - mix it in water or use it in keto baking. It helps keep things moving if you know what I mean.

What I tried and ditched:

Exogenous ketones - expensive and I didn't notice any difference in energy or ketosis levels. Save your money.

Keto pills from amazon - complete waste, most of them are just caffeine and random herbs that do nothing.

Expensive MCT powder - just get the oil, the powder is like 3x the price for no real benefit.

Apple cider vinegar pills - saw people hyping these up but they did absolutely nothing for me.

The chromium thing has been the biggest game changer for managing cravings without actually breaking ketosis. I still get hungry sometimes but my brain isn't screaming at me about carbs every time I walk past a bakery anymore. Everything else is pretty standard keto support stuff that most people probably already know about.

I occasionally take azelastine nasal spray for allergies, and I take a daily multivitamin and probiotic. Lately I have also been taking antacids because I am having a hard time with GERD at present.

I've become a little concerned at the level of fatigue I'm experiencing. This has been going on for over a month. At first, I thought it might be because of fall/winter and the sun going down earlier. But I've become increasingly fatigued, to the point that my eyes will start closing while I'm sitting down as early as 4pm. Randomly, I will also wake up feeling achy for no apparent reason. As in, my biceps and thighs feel 'tired'. There's no real weakness in my muscles, like I can carry and hold things, but it feels weak. Like when you'd get the flu, in a way.

Something to note that I don't know is relevant is I've been battling GERD/gastritis flare since August. I've been eating very clean (non-acidic), and taking Gaviscon uk at least 3x a week. My stool has been green very often but no diarrhea. I still drink one cup of coffee a day.

Maybe this seems like a silly post but the level of my tiredness has honestly become concerning to me. Sometimes I feel like I'm too tired to drive or function even though I've slept at night.

With attendees from 8 months old to over 80, our Spring type-in was so successful, we're hosting another one before the end of the year. Bringing your own typewriter(s) and related ephemera is definitely encouraged, but is entirely optional. 

**Date**  
Saturday, November 29th, 2025

**Time**  
1:00 - 4:00 PM

**Location**  
[Vroman's Bookstore](https://vromansbookstore.com/)  
695 E Colorado Blvd.  
Pasadena, CA 91101

2 blocks West of Lake Avenue, which has both East and Westbound exits off of the 210 Freeway.

We'll be meeting upstairs on the second floor.  Parking available behind the bookstore as well as on surrounding streets. There is a handicapped accessible ramp (from the parking lot in rear) and entrance(s) with an elevator to the second floor as well. (Hint: this is also available for those bringing their collections of standard typewriters.)

# What is a Type-in?

[Type-ins](https://type-in.org/) are community-based, family friendly events at which typewriter enthusiasts share their love for the analog art of putting ink onto paper with mechanical marvels of the late 19th through 20th centuries. To do this they bring one or more manual typewriters and their knowledge and love of the machines to share with the community. New friends share stories, history, repair tips, working methods, and other typewriterly ephemera. Typists of all ages and levels of ability are welcome.

**Typewriters optional**  
We definitely encourage those without their own machines to attend. With some luck and the kindness of new friends, you should be able to try out a variety of machines which are present in an effort to decide what styles and feel you might consider for purchasing one of your own one day (or for the upcoming holidays). Please kindly ask the owners' permission before trying a machine out. If you've got multiple typewriters, feel free to bring an extra for a friend or two. Our current record for the attendee bringing the most typewriters is 6.

# Activities during the afternoon

Below is a list of activities we might try based on the interests of the attendees:

* Basic typewriter demonstrations covering: use, maintenance, and repair; how to find/buy typewriters, how to date the year of manufacture of your machine, etc.
* The holidays are coming, maybe you could type up some holiday cards?
* Speed typing contest
* Writing! (naturally)
   * poetry competition
   * letter and postcard writing;  bring some stationery/envelopes/stamps to write letters to friends & loved ones
   * Typing prompts for those who need inspiration for writing
* Typewriter Art - composing visual pictures using ink on paper
* Cadavre Exquis - a dedicated typewriter with paper is set up for participants to compose and write a group story, each taking turns throughout the event at writing one sentence at a time.
* Impromptu lightning talks of 3-5 minutes on topics like ""how to buy a typewriter"", ""how to get into home typewriter repair"", ""how to work a typewriter into your daily writing routine"", ""how to join the Typosphere"" etc.
* Participants are encouraged to type up their experiences of the event for posting to their personal websites (aka the Typosphere).
* Meet new pen pals to start exchanging letters via typewriter and post
* Selfies with the typewriter mural on the front of the bookstore.
* Typewriter repair advice: Have a broken machine and not sure what's wrong? Get some advice from the community.
* Show off your [typed baseball scorecard from Game 7 of the 2025 World Series](https://boffosocko.com/2025/11/01/los-angeles-dodgers-at-toronto-blue-jays-world-series-game-7-nov-1-2025/). Go Dodgers!
* Bring and share your own ideas... What do you use your typewriter for? (Paul Sheldon, if you're reading this, you can only bring your Smith-Corona, you CANNOT bring your Royal Ten.)

# Vroman's Bookstore

Downstairs stop by their excellent [wine bar](https://vromans1894.com/) or [Tepito Coffee Shop](https://www.tepitocoffee.com/) which will be open for snacks and beverages throughout the day.

Looking for typewriter-related books as holiday gifts and stocking stuffers while you're there? Ask for some of the following:

* Uncommon Type: Some Stories by Tom Hanks (Knopf, 2017)
* Olivetti by Allie Millington (Feiwel & Friends, 2024)

I was going back and forth between regular Whatsapp and Whatsapp Business, and suddenly there was a problem going back to regular Whatsapp due to some installation bug. So i went there, did my backup to google drive, it completed. 

Nightmare started as I tried to check if Whatsapp Business was the issue. Then I uninstalled it. And then I couldn\`t install any of them anymore. Here we go for system restore. And when everything was fresh, I couln't access my google drive backup. Not just that, but it seems I can't find my backup location in my google drive. I could find very old backups from 2023, but somehow it seems that even by signing the option of ""diary backup"", probably did not save a single thing, even if I was there taking my cup of coffee waiting for whatsapp to make a backup. 

I had important info in whatsapp that I always trusted like business information, first images of my daughter etc. The best word that translates my feeling is kind of furious, because I usually don't have a hard time with software. I fiddle with linux, do my statistical programming using R, so I'm not usually the type of user that is not familiar with stuff like this. It feels really trash to have to fiddle in order to decently use backup. Usually retrieving back up is really something kind of automatic. The funny side of it is that even if I'm logged in google drive and whatsapp has every single authorization, it can't even retrieve the backup that I found from 2023.

Right now I'm blaming myself and thinking paranoid, that I should always do physical back up, because this felt like a technology that really can't be trusted. So Im open to listen if anyone has run into the same issue, and if there was a solution for that.",1,1762902340.0,whatsapp,0,1.0,False

1ouoken,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1ouoken/the_work_doesnt_care_about_your_feelings/,The work doesn't care about your feelings,"There's something I call the 'poor man mentality'. This was the man I saw growing up, in my house, in my family, everywhere. This man only ever asks himself: what's the minimum work I can do to not die? That's it. Do the absolute minimum, then waste the rest. Eat garbage, chase whoever will have you, watch TV, play games, be depressed and wonder what went wrong. As if the answer isn't obvious.

On the opposite side of this man, there is something called a rational agent. And sometimes I want to be a rational agent. Given an objective, this agent doesn't give a shit if he's tired, if he fought with his girlfriend last night, if he's ""not feeling it."" The only thing that exists is the objective. He doesn't need to talk himself into anything, the talking is already done when you pick the objective. All the negotiations are priced in.

There's this scene from Silicon Valley. Gilfoyle talking about his server Anton: ""He grimly does his work, then he sits motionless until it's time to work again. We could all take a page from his book.""

And yeah, however soulless that sounds, I like it. For bullshit tasks, sure, it's torture. But for something that actually matters? Something you decided matters? Then it's just... doing it. Without the friction and the drama?

I've always liked machines. Actually, I like anything that just does its job without the theater. A machine doesn't have moods. It doesn't need a coffee first. It doesn't need the weekend to ""recharge."" It runs until it doesn't, and when it doesn't, you fix it or replace it.

You know what I love about a task? It doesn't give a shit about you. It doesn't care about your excuses. It doesn't need convincing. It just sits there, existing, waiting to be done. The task is the most honest thing in your life. It won't lie to you about what needs doing. It won't negotiate. It won't make you feel better about not doing it.

And all our drama, all this talking ourselves into things, treating ourselves like we're some VIP who needs to be persuaded, it's fantasy. We act like we're doing the task a favor by completing it. Like it should be grateful. The task doesn't change. It's still there.

I have this image of an ideal man. Probably doesn't exist. But this guy, when he decides something needs doing, he just... does it? That's it. Just does it. No ceremony. No warm-up. No ""getting in the mood."" And here's the thing, most of what needs doing is boring as hell. Trivial, repetitive, but necessary.

Wake up. Work. Eat. Work. Sleep. Repeat. Not because it's noble or builds character or any of that nonsense. But because that's what the objective requires. The rational agent doesn't need the work to be fun. He doesn't need it to be meaningful in every moment. He already decided it was meaningful when he chose the objective. Everything else is just execution.

You might hate this. I don't care. But if you're still here, maybe there's a part of you that gets it. 

What I'm saying is simple: be more rational than the whiny bitch you are right now, and what you want might be simpler than you think.

Do what needs doing. Do it again. Do it especially when you don't want to. Not because you're building discipline. Not because you're becoming a better person. But because the work is deemed to be necessary by you. And that work doesn't care about your feelings, and neither should you.",5,1762902277.0,productivity,4,0.78,False
