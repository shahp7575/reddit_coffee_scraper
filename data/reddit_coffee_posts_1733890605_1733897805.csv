It was such a relief opening my score report yesterday, although those intrusive thoughts in the back of my head were there telling me there was potential for it to be another ‘F’. I had not even opened my NBOME report at the time, but I received an email from my dean saying ‘Congratulations, stop by and let me buy you a cup of coffee’. From there all of my doubts and negative thoughts went away. For a moment I was even like huh? Maybe it’s a joke.

But here’s to say that there are wins ahead, even if it may feel like there won’t be any. I struggled with the idea of no longer graduating with my original class, and the potential of it being 10x more difficult to match into psych, but everything will be okay. I will cross those bridges when I get there.

I love her but need advice how to continue and what should I do to improve myself in this situation,"Hi Reddit’ers,

I firstly thank you if you have taken the time to read my post and provide any sincere or insightful advice/opinions. TLDR at the bottom if you don't want to read the full details.

**Context**

Trying to keep it short as possible Me (27M) and my gf (24F) have been together as well as living together pretty much everyday since June 2022. 

Nearly hitting our 3 year anniversary and until this incident we have been very loving and caring for one another and she really is the best partner/SO which I was very intentional about marrying (and so is she) with alot of future plans settled

**Lie 1**

Long story SHORT, on 25 June 2024 this year whilst having a meal together, I briefly saw her chatting with someone with a chat interface that looked familiar yet foreign. I didnt think much at first but later that night whilst she was in the shower, I had a quick peek at her phone and found out it was the Bumble App. Never have I ever thought of nor did anything to secretly look at her phone until today.  
I confronted her that night as non-confrontingly as I could and she did get a little upset, and felt embarrassed. She explained that it was the Bumble BFF app and she was just trying to make new **female** friends (it is true that she has expressed herself a few times that she feels she has lack of friends outside of us , but we are really bestfriends together as well!). She mentioned she had just downloaded it a day ago (this is true I checked).  
After some talking, and clarifying and she was open to me looking at her chats (which I didn't because I trusted her) we hugged it out , cried a little and all is well.  
  
**Lie 2**

Fast Forward the next day, I have this unsettling gut feeling that something was amiss,   
firstly I decided to take a **SECOND** peek at her phone and found out there were some guys in the Bumble BFF (I didn't really look into the chats) so this really threw me off as from my understanding Bumble BFF doesn't allow you to match with the opposite gender.  
I also went through abit of her Whatsapp (which she normally only uses to chat with my mom, or nail salons etc.) I found an odd phone number in the archived chat dated around November 2023 with an Indonesian guy (**this is important later**) with slightly flirtatious but definitely a genuine interest to get to know him kind of chatter. He did try to ask her out a few times for coffee which she said she was busy and turned down kindly and the chat abruptedly ends there. The one message that threw me off was after a day of chatting she said ""**Goodnight, sweet dreams**""   
I confronted her later that night which she became really defensive but clarified that she met him on ""Little Red Book (Xiaohongshu)"" which is a very popular CHINESE like reddit/pinterest app. She claims that she was checking out posts about making friends in a new city, and he commented on her reply on a post and thats how the conversation started. Keep in mind the ""Little Red Book"" app is a chinese language app and 99% of users are chinese/mandarin literate users. Whilst not impossible, it was very unconvincing that she could have met an Indonesian guy on the app who decided to chat her up and they had an exchange of numbers (**keeping in mind I found their chat on Whatsapp**).  
After abit of confrontation and lots of tears, it took us a few days to really reconcile and at that time I really decided to take her word and forgive her and wanted to move on. This was roughly around the 28th of June.

**Lie 3**

Over the next few months, things were getting better and I could clearly see she has put in extra effort and care in the way she treats me or approaches me and a genuine effort to reconcile.  
Whilst all this, I have to admit that there is always a feeling in the back of my mind that she had illicit/sexual intentions (Emotional Affair) when doing all of the above mentioned. However we went on a few trips together which really kept my mind off these things and all is well.  
Throughout the few months post this incident, I sometimes try to ""dig"" out this Indonesian guy from ""Little Red book"" app but obviously could not find any relevant information. I did the most unspeakable thing you could do (and I am still ashamed and feel it is really pitiful I have to resort to this) but I actually texted the number (keeping in mind from Lie 2, I saw his number from her Whatsapp chat)   
To my surprise in early November, he actually replied me and after I clarified what has happened and who I was, he was really a swell guy and I just wanted to get clarity and truth and more information on the encounter. Long story short, he showed me that they did not meet over such an app but instead they met on Bumble (Date) in October 2023 last year. This really consumed me knowing she had lied and denied. I thank the lad and the next day, I mustered my gut to confront my gf again.  
This time, she fell into a RAGE and got extremely defensive and firstly scolded me for bringing this topic up again when she thought all was well and has been reconciled. Secondly, she clarifies that she denied and didnt tell the whole truth because I would have overreacted had she told me they met on Bumble instead of the ""Little Red Book"" app. I explained to her that whats done is done but that she needed to acknowledge her mistakes and accept for us to move on. She also denied that she ever used Bumble date and ONLY the BFF feature (Which I know is not true as I had seen from the guy they matched on Date and as far as I am aware, you cannot match with the opposite gender on BFF mode). We argued and she flipped out and wanted to leave the house to ""let her mind think"" but after I tried to calm her down she stayed. I didn't push another further on the topic or why she still lied to my face even after I have evidence as I did not want to anger her anymore.  


**Lie 4 - Final**  
Since then up till today I have felt resentful and impatient and have this unsettling feeling at the back of my mind and heart. I felt betrayed as I have never ever checked her phone until this incident, never ever chatted with a women, never done anything that could even potential hurt her and have poured my heart and soul into our relationship.  
Long story short, in January 2024 this year it was our first time seperating as she went back to China (her home country) to visit family and it was the first time we LDR for 2 weeks as she was desperate to see family).   
Last night, I was helping her (infront of her) setup a setting on her phone and I accidentally saw an OLD text message which was a verification code for a Chinese Dating App called ""TANTAN"" which is a chinese version of Tinder. This text message was dated 15 January which was when she was visiting family in China, but thats the only information I have on that occurence.

I have not brought it up and I am considering to not even bring it up and brush it off as a moment of weakness but it is eating me out inside and out, and affecting my work.

**TLDR**  
Together me (M27) and gf (F24) for nearly 3 years with marriage plans.

* June 2024: Found her using Bumble BFF as I accidentally saw her chatting with someone on it, claimed it was to make female friends. I believed her but next day had a gut feeling something is amissed.
* Later found chats with men on the app (did not read chats and as far as I am aware, Bumble BFF does not let you match with the opposite gender) and on WhatsApp, including one Indonesian guy (important) from November 2023 with slight flirtation. She claimed they met on “Little Red Book.” (A Reddit/Pinterest-like app that almost exclusively chinese use as 99.99% of posts are in Mandarin Chinese) Felt this was partially BS.
* November 2024: Confirmed via the man directly with screenshots they met on Bumble Date, not BFF. She denied using Bumble Date and only ever used BFF mode, got defensive when confronted.
* December 2024 (NOW): Recently Discovered a Tantan verification code during her trip to China (The code was sent on 15 January 2024 and looking back at our chat history she was in China during this day) (first time we LDR for 2 weeks as she was desperate to visit family) Unsure how to address this and I have not confronted her as I fear it will make her explode but it is eating me alive.

Let's face it, bad breath can be a real social killer. It can make you self-conscious, hinder your confidence, and even affect your personal and professional relationships. While mints and mouthwash offer temporary fixes, they often mask the underlying problem without addressing the root cause. More and more, people are turning to a more holistic and sustainable solution: oral probiotics for bad breath. But what exactly are they, and how do they work? This article delves into the science behind oral probiotics, explores their benefits, and offers practical advice on how to incorporate them into your daily routine. We'll uncover the secrets to achieving fresh breath naturally and sustainably, leaving you feeling confident and ready to face the world head-on.

Oral Probiotics for Bad Breath: Understanding the Science
---------------------------------------------------------

Before diving into the nitty-gritty of oral probiotics, let's first understand the science behind bad breath, or halitosis, as it's known in the medical world. In most cases, the culprit is the volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) produced by bacteria living in your mouth, particularly on the back of your tongue. Think of your mouth as a bustling metropolis, teeming with both good and bad bacteria. When the bad guys outnumber the good, it can lead to an imbalance, resulting in those dreaded VSCs and, consequently, bad breath.

### The Role of Bacteria in Oral Health

So, where do probiotics fit into this picture? Well, probiotics are live microorganisms, often referred to as ""good bacteria,"" that offer numerous health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts. They can help restore the balance of your oral microbiome – the unique community of bacteria residing in your mouth – by crowding out the odor-causing bacteria and promoting a healthier oral environment. Think of it like introducing a friendly police force to maintain order in your mouth's bustling city.

### How Oral Probiotics Tackle Bad Breath

Oral probiotics work their magic in several ways:

1. **Competing with Bad Bacteria:** Probiotics compete with the bad bacteria for resources and space, effectively reducing their numbers and limiting their ability to produce VSCs.
2. **Producing Beneficial Enzymes:** Certain probiotics produce enzymes that break down VSCs, neutralizing the odor at its source.
3. **Boosting the Immune System:** A healthy oral microbiome bolstered by probiotics can enhance your local immunity, further helping to fight off harmful bacteria.

Oral Probiotics for Bad Breath: Choosing the Right Strain
---------------------------------------------------------

Now that we’ve established that oral probiotics can be a game-changer, the next question is: which strain is right for you? Not all probiotics are created equal. Some strains are more effective than others at combating bad breath. Here are a few strains that have shown promising results in studies:

- **Streptococcus salivarius K12:** This strain is known for its ability to produce a bacteriocin called BLIS K12, which inhibits the growth of bacteria associated with bad breath and strep throat.
- **Streptococcus salivarius M18:** Similar to K12, this strain also produces beneficial bacteriocins that can help combat bad breath.
- **Lactobacillus reuteri:** This strain has been shown to reduce the levels of VSCs in saliva, leading to fresher breath.

Oral Probiotics for Bad Breath: Incorporating them into Your Routine
--------------------------------------------------------------------

So, how can you incorporate these helpful microbes into your daily life? Luckily, oral probiotics are available in various forms, making it easy to find one that fits your lifestyle:

### Probiotic Lozenges and Chewing Gum

These are perhaps the most convenient way to introduce probiotics directly into your mouth. Sucking on a probiotic lozenge or chewing probiotic gum after meals can help replenish the good bacteria and neutralize any lingering odors.

### Probiotic Mouthwash

While traditional mouthwashes often contain harsh chemicals that can disrupt the oral microbiome, probiotic mouthwashes offer a gentler approach. They can help rinse away debris while also introducing beneficial bacteria.

### Probiotic Toothpaste

Brushing with probiotic toothpaste can supplement your oral hygiene routine by adding a dose of good bacteria to your mouth twice a day.

Oral Probiotics for Bad Breath: Beyond the Basics
-------------------------------------------------

While oral probiotics can be incredibly effective, they aren’t a magic bullet. For optimal results, it's important to adopt a holistic approach to oral hygiene.

### Lifestyle Factors that Contribute to Bad Breath

Certain lifestyle factors can exacerbate bad breath, and addressing these is crucial. Think about it – even the best police force can't maintain order in a city constantly bombarded with chaos. Here are some common culprits:

- **Dehydration:** Saliva plays a vital role in washing away food particles and bacteria. Dehydration reduces saliva production, creating a breeding ground for odor-causing bacteria.
- **Smoking:** Smoking dries out the mouth and introduces harmful chemicals that contribute to bad breath.
- **Certain Foods:** Foods like garlic, onions, and coffee can linger on the breath long after you’ve finished eating them.
- **Underlying Medical Conditions:** In some cases, bad breath can be a symptom of an underlying medical condition, such as gum disease or sinus infections.

### Tips for Maintaining Fresh Breath

Here are some additional tips to help you maintain fresh breath and a healthy oral microbiome:

- **Brush and floss regularly:** This helps remove food particles and plaque that can harbor bacteria.
- **Clean your tongue:** Don’t forget to brush or scrape your tongue, as this is where a significant amount of odor-causing bacteria resides.
- **Drink plenty of water:** Staying hydrated keeps your mouth moist and helps wash away debris.
- **Eat a balanced diet:** A healthy diet supports a healthy oral microbiome.

Oral Probiotics for Bad Breath: Are There Any Side Effects?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Generally, oral probiotics are considered safe for most people. However, some individuals may experience mild side effects like gas or bloating, especially when they first start taking them. These side effects are usually temporary and subside as your body adjusts. If you have any concerns or underlying health conditions, it's always best to consult with your dentist or doctor before adding probiotics to your regimen.

Oral Probiotics for Bad Breath: A Fresh Approach to Oral Hygiene
----------------------------------------------------------------

Oral probiotics offer a promising natural approach to tackling bad breath. By understanding the science behind bad breath and the role of oral probiotics, you can make informed decisions about incorporating them into your daily routine. Remember, achieving lasting fresh breath requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses both targeted probiotic use and a commitment to overall oral hygiene.

1hbmxma,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bengaluru/comments/1hbmxma/daily_animal_obstacle_course/,Daily animal obstacle course,"It's a daily practice of mine to walk around Ulsoor lake. The footpath that surrounds the lake isn't anything to talk about, actually, it's downright horrifying. There are stones, bundles of wire, gaping holes, metal rods sticking out of the ground waiting to impale you if you trip... the whole thing seems to be an especially designed scheme to raise situational awareness among citizens. Keep you on your toes, I mean.

  
Here is this morning's list to add to that tally:

1. Piles of Dog poop on the pavements, presumably to encourage hopscotching.
2. Cow poop, and the cows themselves  parking their ample butts all over the footpath.
3. A dozen Rats, in at least 3 separate locations along the trail, eating biryani.
4. And finally, one helmeted gentleman gesturing at me to step into the traffic while he and about 150 pigeons have completely taken over the footpath. He's throwing puffed rice at them with one hand, and waving me to get out onto the road with the other. I had enough by then and ploughed right into the beak and wing and scattered the little shits. I think he may have shouted out something nasty at me, but I had my headphones on and Foo fighters were playing, so screw him.

The one nice thing during this whole episode was when I stopped for coffee at the Darshini near the WW2 light tank, the Stuart honey. I was sitting on this little concrete wall, sipping my filter coffee and there was a crow standing behind me. He kept creeping up behind my back, like he wanted to pick my pocket, but being very polite about it.  I realised that I was sitting near a little chicken bone, so I got off my butt, he stepped in and picked it up, I sat back down, and he flew away, bone in beak. 

Now this is the kind of civil behaviour that makes up for the rest of the crap during my morning walk today.

  
Anyway, that was my rant. I've got to get to work now and confront a different kind of animal, who also poop, but they do it through email.

He’s gone now, along with the rest of them. It’s been about a six months now, I think. I never told him that I loved him, or even kissed him, or even held him in my arms. He knew though. That was what scared him off I think.



The poor, sad bastard could never admit that he was gay. I watched him trudge into so many doomed relationships with women he didn’t care for, just to prove otherwise. I don’t think he even realized that all his closest friends were gay men. He just liked to think that he surrounded himself with poets and artist types. He was too absorbed in himself and in his books to notice anyone else around him anyways.



He would always put on a show for women of how well read and thoughtful he was. He would talk for hours on end, sounding so soulful, so caring, so contemplative. I was around long enough to realize he followed the same script every time though. The act would be up after the third or fourth date when he’d worked his way through the roster of his favorite media.



I liked him better when he was drunk and angry. He was never mean. He was always belligerent though, always thoughtless, always impulsive. It was a much prettier side to him than the tortured artist act. I liked to watch him sucking down cigarettes like candy instead of treating each one like it was a symbol of his martyrdom.



I realize it only sounds like I’m insulting him, but to love someone is to love despite their flaws. He was kind. He was great with children. He really cared about people who weren’t women he was sleeping with. He would be a great father, I think. I liked the way he wore his heart on his sleeve.



One day he just stopped speaking to me. I don’t know what did it. I don’t think it was anything I did. As far as I can tell, he just got into one of his moods and cut us all off and decided to change his life around. It could have been one of our other friends he was fighting with. I don’t know.



I got word recently that he’s with a man now. Someone saw them holding hands at the coffee shop we used to go to. I guess that’s a good resolution to my thoughts of him, at least. I know he’s not hiding anymore. I just wish it could have been me.



The last time I saw him was at an art show. It was the first time I’d had a painting appear in a gallery. I was ecstatic. He was there long before I got there. I hugged him, excited that he came for me. He was angry. He left in a hurry. I still wonder why.



Through the whole night, I felt that the world had shifted around me. Something told me that I would wake up in a different world tomorrow than I had that morning. I looked into my painting then, my eyes locked at the yellow orange hue of the sun recreated in it. I look into it now and I feel the same. I hate it. It’s like it’s stained.



His gaze still burns into my every action, my choices still burdened by his fleeting opinions. I feel I’ve grown though. I feel I’m a better person than I was when I knew him. For better or for worse, we wouldn’t fit each other anymore. I’ve grown to be my own person, independent of his desires.



I can’t live my life burdened by the past. How ever much he meant to me, that time is gone. The sun rises and a day begins anew. I can’t hold onto tattered promises, long forgotten. Love will find me again, hope will sit in my heart. The world is always changing. I can’t expect it to stand still for me.



Loving men is madness to me. I can’t understand how I could think so lowly of someone and still long for them to be in my arms. I still miss him though. I still hope that he will text. Love is not something that can be understood. He disgusts me yet he is inescapably captivating.



I think growing still is healthy. I recognize that my life is better now without him, however much he may have meant to me. Life is constant change. I’ll become who I’m meant to be, regardless of the absence or presence of him, the man I saw to be my North Star. I’ll hold direction no matter where I turn.



I look now to myself. I look now to the future. I look to the person I can become, unburdened by what has been. I can be a far better person than the husk of a man that he knew me as. I deserve the life that I can build for myself. What could have been will ring in my ears until the day that I die but it will never hold me back from what can still be.



He called me today. It killed whatever urges I had. I wasn’t as excited to hear from him as I thought I’d be. He was cold and distant. He just asked for a book back that he’d left at my house. He left a lot of books at my house. I’ll bring it back to him soon. It feels like closing the chapter off. At least I can say goodbye.",1,1733896245.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

She smelt the same, her lavender honey perfume wafting off of the perfectly mimicked features of the woman strapped to a chair. He hit her again and watched the skin pull away from the swirling gray liquid that sat encased in whatever this thing was made out of, before it snapped back into place.

“I am your wife John… Please…”

“Shut up! Shut the fuck up! You are not my wife you fucking monster!”

“Please John! Please… You… You have to stop…” 

Tears were pouring from lifeless eyes, trails of blood dripping out of her nostrils. John knew the moment he had woken up, and turned to her in bed, that something was off.

This was not his wife.

“What… have you done… with my wife?”

The door to their bedroom opened behind him, a man walking in holding a gun pointed directly at john.

“Marci, what’s going on!? Get the fuck back guy! Marci, are you okay!?”

John stood there silent, himself staring directly back with a loaded gun point at his chest, but he had that same, lifeless stare. The man in the doorway walked forward as John took a step back, slowly lowering himself to the ground.

“Who… Who the fuck are you!?”

“John, what’s going on!?”

Marci was frantically looking back and forth between the two, terror on the rest of her face as her eyes stared blankly.

“Who the fuck am I? Who the fuck are you!? You’re lucky i’m not shooting you in the fucking head! Marci, are you okay!?”

“I… I’m fine john… What's going on?”

“I don’t know Marci… Who… Who is this man?”

“I… don’t know… I thought he was you… He was in our bed. Where did you go john?”

“I was picking up coffee Marci. Are you okay?”

“Y-yes… I think so…”

The man walked forward and hit John in the forehead with the hilt of his gun, before getting his face inches from him, and speaking in a low tone.

“Now… I’m gonna ask this one more time… Who the fuck are you?”

(Arcane Exfil Chapter 5),"[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gs72m9/why_isekai_high_schoolers_as_heroes_when_you_can/)

**Blurb:**

When a fantasy kingdom needs heroes, they skip the high schoolers and summon hardened Delta Force operators.

Lieutenant Cole Mercer and his team are no strangers to sacrifice. After all, what are four men compared to millions of lives saved from a nuclear disaster? But as they make their last stand against insurgents, they’re unexpectedly pulled into another world—one on the brink of a demonic incursion.

Thrust into Tenria's realm of magic and steam engines, Cole discovers a power beyond anything he'd imagined: magic—a way to finally win without sacrifice, a power fantasy made real by ancient mana and perfected by modern science.

But his new world might not be so different from the old one, and the stakes remain the same: there are people who depend on him more than ever; people he might not be able to save. Cole and his team are but men, facing unimaginable odds. Even so, they may yet prove history's truth: that, at their core, the greatest heroes are always just human.

**Chapter 5: Home Sweet Home**

\-- --

The infirmary was close enough to the armory to justify a quick revisit, but lingering any longer than necessary wasn’t worth it. Mack was still there, lying in his bed, at the mercy of his coma. Cole could visit later; for now, just familiarizing himself with the basic layout would do.



The kitchen proved more lively.



The area rivaled any modern commercial operation in scope. Despite the numerous occupied stovetops aglow with flames and red light, the room didn’t feel stuffy –  like a Korean BBQ joint with proper ventilation. Another steampunk pastiche, courtesy of Celdorne’s finest artisans.



None of the dishes looked familiar though. Various meats Cole couldn’t identify sizzled in massive pots, surrounded by vegetables that definitely weren’t in any Earth cookbook. The smells were good, at least. Hell, after dealing with a JNI dirty bomb, the ensuing clusterfuck, and then getting isekai’d, his stomach could care less about alien gastronomy.



Fotham, despite his intentions on behalf of the kingdom, seemed at least considerate of the shit they’d been through. Probably having heard their growling stomachs, Fotham led them to a cook built like he’d spent his life hauling heavy sacks of food and cookware. 



“Master Marwin,” Fotham greeted him. “Our special guests have been at practice. Three mana potions, if you please.”



“Training, are they?” The cook gave their gear a long look, but his thoughts remained unspoken. “Never seen soldiers fitted thus – begging your pardon, of course.” Turning to a shelf, he grabbed three blue vials. “Fair warning: nary a soul drinks this without grimacing. Bitter as an Aurelian at market. Though we’ve ways of making it less offensive.”



Marwin turned to what looked like an icebox built into the wall. “Sunfruit press helps it down. Or…” He pulled open the door, cold air spilling out. “Ah! Apples from the southern provinces, fresh as morning. Rare sight indeed. Though… well, there’s other mixtures that serve just as well.”



As enticing as it was to get hammered after dealing with the strangest day of his life, Cole had to turn down the offer. “Yeah, maybe another time. I think we’ll just go with the uh, the apple juice, right?”



His team nodded, eagerly so. Looked like no one wanted to play guinea pig with sunfruit – not today at least. The apple mix would do just fine; they’d already signed up for one mystery drink with that blue stuff, and that was plenty for now.



They downed the drinks together. 



Not bad – the apple juice masked most of that promised bitterness, though a metallic aftertaste lingered. The warmth spreading through Cole’s chest felt like that first sip of coffee in the morning, minus the usual jitters. Some of that training fatigue started to fade too.



“Hungry lot, I’d wager,” the cook said, still tending his pots. “Got a good consommé on – marsh buck stewed with koreth root. Been at it since dawn. Also got drell flanks rubbed with viss and aged in wine. Sarn and cave pheasant from the eastern ranges. Riverfish in melted butter with fresh shrolt.” He wiped his hands on his apron. “His Majesty’s special guests ought to eat proper, after all.”



The aromas wafting through the kitchen conjured up those fancy cooking shows where even the intrepid hosts sometimes found themselves linguistically fucked. Koreth root? Viss? At least ‘marsh buck’ and ‘cave pheasant’ gave him some idea what he’d be eating. The wine-rich smell from that drell dish *was* pretty darn promising though. After months of MREs, he sure as hell wasn’t gonna turn down some royal Michelin star bangers.



“Hell, reckon we might as well try a bit of everything,” Miles said, probably thinking the same thing. “Ain’t had somethin’ proper in a minute.”



No argument there. At this point, Cole would’ve demolished a 7/11 hot dog, let alone whatever culinary extravagance they were about to get.



Fotham nodded to Marwin. “I shall have the maids fetch the meals when our guests have settled upon their quarters. Now,” he turned to Cole and the others, “let us proceed to the guest wing.”



From the kitchens, a series of corridors branched deeper into the castle complex. Cole kept track of their turns – left at the first major intersection, past what looked like administrative offices, then up a broad staircase lined with bright lamps.



Their path led through an open-air colonnade, where afternoon light threw bold shadows across a checkered marble floor. The castle grounds stretched out below, visible between the classical columns. Reminded him of those old European castles he’d visited years back. Same grandeur, same attention to detail, almost literally. Funny how that worked; of all the possible forms an isekai world could take, it just had to be medieval European fantasy. Maybe architectural styles followed some universal law of convergent evolution?



The guest wing occupied the castle's eastern corner. It was perfect for visiting nobles or foreign dignitaries – morning sun, decent elevation, multiple evacuation routes if Cole read those hallway junctions right. The deeper they went, the more refined the decor became. Polished wood replaced stone walls while elaborate carpets replaced marble.



Runic patterns lit up as they passed, almost acting like motion sensors – some kinda monitoring system, probably. The guards they'd passed were positioned at key junctions, maintaining clear lines of sight down each corridor. Between this and the fortress-level security from when they’d first arrived, it seemed like Celdorne definitely didn’t take any chances.



“Those runes,” Ethan said, “Motion sensors?”



“Indeed.” Fotham paused in front of one of the runes. “Experience has taught us, rather painfully, that certain demons may bend light to conceal their presence. These runes perceive their movement and render such sorcery quite useless.”



He led them down the final corridor, stopping at the first of several identical wooden doors. “Your chambers,” he said, gesturing inside.



High ceilings, polished wood, brass fixtures? For all their practicality elsewhere, Celdorne didn't skimp on hospitality either. Though maybe that was practical in its own way, when it came to housing important guests. The room itself was spacious enough, centered around a canopied bed that put their Jadiran accommodations to shame. A desk caught the afternoon light from tall windows, and a side door opened to what had to be a restroom, given the pipes running along the walls.



“Damn,” Miles whistled. “Sure could get used to this.”



“We have four such chambers like this, reserved for diplomatic guests.” He brought them to the other rooms, each one following the same layout.



Miles tugged at his collar as they entered the third room. “A bit warm in this one, ain’t it?”



“Ah.” Fotham moved to what first appeared to be metallic wall art – an ornate piece with flowing lines that, on closer inspection, formed a temperature gradient. He passed his hand over the left side, and a pleasant coolness began filtering through the room. 



The runes flickered as he adjusted the temperature. The closest analogue would probably be one of those old analog thermostats, just with magic instead of mercury. Different principles, same basic idea.



The rooms seemed comfortable enough, but something felt… off. Were they really gonna take separate rooms, leaving their backs bare to a bunch of strangers they hardly knew? Fuck no. 



“If such private chambers prove unsuitable, perhaps I might show you our more commodious arrangements.”



Cole raised an eyebrow. Awfully on point, even for someone as keen as Fotham. Either their host had a doctorate in cold reading, or this world’s list of impossibilities included telepathy, telekinesis, and the other various flavors of extrasensory perception.



Well, if Fotham was a telepath, he sure as hell didn’t react to the image of the Booty Warrior and his plans for ‘Chris Handsome’ that Cole had intended to subject them both to.



The confirmation of mental privacy, unfortunately, wasn’t quite worth being the only one stuck with *that* mental image. “Uh… yeah. Let’s check those out.”



They walked down another corridor to a wider set of double doors. The ‘commodious arrangements’ turned out to be a family suite. A central parlor opened up into multiple bedrooms, not unlike the setups in period dramas where aristocrats traveled with entire households in tow.



Sunlight poured through tall windows that ran along a wall, bathing the living room. Lamps cast steady light from the corners, something closer to captured daylight instead of the flicker of flames or incandescence of bulbs. Fotham passed his hand near a runic panel on the wall, and the glow dimmed.



The room stretched up to a high coffered ceiling. Felt weird being in a space this grand after months of cramped quarters, though even ‘grand’ was an understatement. It was more like… stepping into some alternate timeline where the industrial revolution found purchase with magic instead of steam. 



Miles seemed to have the right idea, sinking into one of the velvet armchairs with an appreciative sigh. 



Cole looked out the windows. They were three, maybe four stories up, with a clear view over the castle walls to the city beyond. He’d expected something grimier given all the Victorian aesthetic, but apparently, he’d forgotten all about the other possibility: Gilded elegance. All the better for his lungs. Cole’s lifespan probably went up a decade just knowing that this city wasn’t some pseudo-London hellscape choking on industrial fumes. 



Domed structures, early skyscrapers, and towers caught the sun, rising between buildings that wouldn’t have looked out of place in London or Paris or Prague. But where those ancient capitals drowned in their own antiquated civil planning, this place seemed to have considered traffic larger than carriages from the get-go. Wide boulevards stretched between buildings like they’d been transplanted from Los Angeles, as if someone had built a European capital from scratch instead of piling it on top of a thousand years of urban sprawl.



The harbor in the distance was almost as impressive. Ironclads and wooden sailing ships bearing all manner of flags and designs dotted the water, numbering in the dozens.



“Alexandria,” Fotham said, his reflection appearing in the window. “While our capital cannot boast the vast expanses of Aurelia’s cities – or coffers – we pride ourselves on rather more practical achievements. Those cranes you see at the docks? A Celdornian innovation. As are the steam vessels that grace our harbors. Indeed,” he continued, almost drunk on pride, “almost all the merchant houses and companies of the continent maintain offices here.”



Cole nodded, turning away from the window. Proper infrastructure, exclusive access to magitech, and heavy trade? It was the obvious recipe for small but loaded, yet Celdorne’s apparent lack of colonial reach was curious – ethics aside. Did the demons truly have enough of their attention to curb the kingdom’s ambitions, or was it something else?



“The bedrooms are this way,” Fotham offered.



They entered the master bedroom first – easily twice the size of the singles they’d looked at earlier. Canopied bed, tall windows, private restroom, various other furnishings. A heavy wooden desk sat beneath a mirror with dials built into its frame. Similar runic constructions to those throughout the castle were etched into the metal, likely the Scrying Pane. The master bedroom alone would be more than enough, let alone the entire suite.



The 3 other side bedrooms were smaller, but no less extravagant. At this point, calling dibs wasn’t even necessary.



But then, what was that other door down the corridor? 



“The service passage.” Fotham opened it, revealing a simple hallway. “Though I dare say you'll find little purpose in it, save perhaps for giving the maids a fright.”



So, another entrance. Or exit.



Cole nodded, returning to the living room. The afternoon sun made it feel warm, cozy, *well-earned*. “Alright then. Four rooms; one for each of us plus one for Mack when he’s back on his feet. Seems good to me.”



“Yup,” Miles agreed.



Cole glanced at Ethan. He gave a thumbs up.

Perfect. Cole turned to Fotham. “We’ll take the suite.”



“Very good. Then, allow me to show you the Scrying Pane.”



He brought them back to the master bedroom, stopping at the mirror mounted above the desk. When he turned one of the brass dials on its frame, the mirror’s surface brightened with a magical glow.



“Each number upon the dial connects to its appointed chamber.” He gestured to the reference card. “The guard posts occupy the first four, followed by the throne room, infirmary, kitchens, and this floor’s servants. Here is your own copy of the registry – I suggest you commit the essential numbers to memory.”



Cole accepted it, looking through the list. A directory system. Simple, practical, much like the simple ones hotels usually had.



Fotham turned to the first position and the mirror’s surface rippled before showing two guards at their post. The image quality made early Skype look cutting-edge, but hell, they’d solved video calls while their counterparts on Earth were barely on the telegraph.



“Director,” one of the guards nodded.



“As you were.” His image disappeared as Fotham returned the dial to the starting point. “When the mirror brightens and chimes, turn here from ‘inactive’ to ‘active.’ Return it so when you wish to end the connection.”



Fotham moved on to a second dial. “In times of urgency, turn to the first position – it shall alert all guard posts at once.”



Cole nodded. Before him were the essential features distilled to their simplest form – ring, answer, hang up. Even included their little version of 911. “And security?”



“The mirrors are fixed in place, and our chambers remain quite restricted. We’ve found no cause for concern these many years.”



Physical security – the original access controlled. Fair enough. When a network required line of sight and manual operation, ‘hacking’ became a strictly literal affair.



“Have you any questions? The Pane? Your chambers?” Fotham asked.



Miles and Ethan shook their heads. 



“Think we’re good,” Cole said. “You’ve been thorough; thanks.”



“Very well. Your servants shall bring your evening meal in an hour’s time. Should you require anything before then, your servants may be reached via position eight.” Fotham gave a slight bow. “Good evening, gentlemen.”



The door closed with a soft click. Time to familiarize themselves with home sweet home.

1hbmm6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1hbmm6e/ex_blocked_me_on_everything_how_do_i_not_get_down/,Ex blocked me on everything. How do I not get down about it?,"Broke up with my ex almost a year ago. I was the dumper. After a period of no contact, we tried to be friends. After a few hangouts, I realized I couldn’t handle it. So I told her in person I couldn’t do any 1:1 contact and that we should work out our feelings on our own. I also told her I wasn’t mad and that I’d say hi and converse if we saw each other in group settings. She admitted she was hoping the whole time to get back together. As I thought about that more after the fact, I was hurt because it felt like I could no longer trust her intentions.

She reached out over text a few times after that. Most of the time I would respond, sometimes re-iterating my boundaries but through my actions not actually respecting my own.

A month or two later, we saw each other at a party. I was anxious seeing her, but talked to her for a little while trying to see if I could just move past the discomfort knowing we’d be around each other in the future. As she was leaving and saying goodbye, she asked if I wanted to ever get coffee or something. I re-iterated that my answer is no. She was persistent asking me, I just kept saying it’d be too painful. I also know she has a new boyfriend and I said I don’t think it’d be appropriate for us to hang out.

After that night I blocked her number because I didn’t trust myself to not respond to her. And because I felt like she wasn’t respecting my boundaries. A few months later she DMs me on a group messaging app we both use for our mutual organization saying she felt hurt that I find it painful to be around her, and that she’s hopeful we can eventually be friends. I didn’t reply.

This week we saw each other again at a group happy hour. The whole time we pretty much ignored each other until the end when we were all leaving and exchanged pleasantries. Later that night I got curious so I looked her up on Instagram. Turns out she had blocked me. After some digging, it looks like she blocked me on every platform.

I feel very hurt, even though I shouldn’t be because I was the one who didn’t want to maintain a friendship and blocked her number. How do I cope?",0,1733895395.0,internetparents,2,0.5,False

I'm extremely excited for the opportunity, but feel as though my resume isn't very strong and gives me a lot of self doubt when applying, and I definitely don't want to waste an opportunity like this.

For the last 2 weeks I have been getting roughly 3 hours of sleep every night but somehow I feel awake and alert for the vast majority of the day. Of course there are moments when it hits me but overall I feel fine better than normal even. I have had insomnia before but it was fairly transitory and always made me feel awful. 

I do not drink, I take moderate amounts of coffee and never after 1pm, I don't take naps,I go to the gym daily and I eat healthy.

Also my physical/mental health doesn't seem to be suffering Im still hitting PRs in the gym I'm just very confused and a little worried.

Does anyone have any experience with this or recommendation? It would be greatly appreciated.

I feel like my whole life I’ve been alone like no one is there for me. I’ve had some “friends” but not really that close, tried going new places to make new friends like parties, coffee shops, around campus, Churches, gyms, but it never works out. I make some friends but they’re just more of acquaintances. I have family which I am very grateful for but even then I feel I can’t talk to them. Can’t seem to get into a relationship, I try and try and try and try but it never works out. I’m even talking to a girl rn and she’s great she’s kinda the same where she’s pretty lonely so I thought great we can make each other better and at first it was great but then she started having just personal issues with herself and family so we haven’t actually gotten into a relationship yet. We can’t hang out much and we use to text everyday but I’ve been slowly not texting her as much. Ik this may seem selfish and I don’t tell her this but it kinda feels like the rug was pulled out from under me. She still wants a relationship sometime just she can’t do much with her current situation which I understand just sucks. I feel I can’t really talk to her either cause she takes a while to respond which idk I feel I have to force myself to not care what she does to make it better  but it’s hard. I’ve put my all into try to help and make it work but idk if it’s helped at all. Ik I’m not suppose to depend on people to fill loneliness so I guess that’s my fault. I don’t really talk to much girls anyways or approach them for their numbers or whatever but I’ve had some ask for mine as well. I feel I’m not ugly but I’m average I guess, I’ve done a lot to work on my self physically, I own a business and make good money, put a lot of work in myself physically so more people would like me but mentally I’m just not good. I have to put on a facade everyday like I’m all good but I’m not. I also have some high standards so that has caused some fallouts with girls I’ve talked too. I’ve tried to be the best I can especially with this girl, I buy her stufff even when she doesn’t want me too, bought her flowers,tell her how pretty she is and how great she is, I’m there when she’s upset and sad and angry and help her talk about how she feels, give her advice when she’s needs it and I want to do so much more for her but I know it’s not her fault she can’t rn. It’s like the main thing I crave is a good relationship but somehow I always ends the same with me alone. I see these other couples doing things together and that just seems so fun to me but it’s something I can’t seem to get.

I have also pushed some people away which I feel was bc I was scared they were gonna leave me anyways so I pushed them before they could. I feel I have no one to trust. Even Friends I’ve had since elementary school I’ve stopped talking too cause they didn’t really care. I’ve made efforts with friends and even family and I feel extremely ignored. I don’t talk much anyways either at home or in public, I’m always worried about what people think about me even random people I’ll never see again. I don’t want to appear weird or annoying to people and don’t want to be a burden cause that’s how I constantly feel. Which gives me a little social anxiety i think. But I do try new things. 

I always try and be there for my friends, I’ve given them jobs when they need it, rides, money, food, try and hangout with them but some who I thought were close just don’t care. I let them know I’m there for them to talk and stuff but it’s never reciprocated. I use to play video games with them all the time but now it’s always just me playing bymyself. I’ve tried to find things to do on my own like reading, working out, building legos, playing instruments, and I spend most of my days doing those things but it’s all just a distraction from the feeling. 

I feel I annoy everyone and no one really cares. Idk how much more I can take this shit sucks. I feel my life is too good to take it and it would be unfair to others who want to live but I’m ok with dying in an accident or something. Or I just want to move soemwhere no one I know knows where I am and just isolate myself from everyone and be truly alone so there’s no expectation from people. I’ve tried all the shit I can liek try to be happy when it’s just me and all that but it all never works it’s just the same feeling and partly this shitty town that I’m stuck in has no opportunity.

It's infuriating! Instead of following basic traffic etiquette, these drivers sneak into the station, a drive out the other side trying to skip a few 100 meters. They end up slowing down the already slow traffic.

I am unsure as to why ENOC does not take action, as majority of these cars dont even fuel up or buy from ZOOM. I also previously had a car zip between two card being fuelled at this station ( one of them being mine), but it also causes unnecessary congestion when they rejoin the road like they own it. When I was fueling up here, I have seemed the station attendants having to act like they are jaywalking in their own workplace.

This is then exasperated, when the entitled lot cuts in coming the wrong way from Warehouses land.  There seems to almost no cop presence (3-4 times a month) along this section. 

Makes me feel bad for following the rules. I know some will say Karma will catch up to them but that does not seem to happen. there is no point fining people 2 to 3 times a month.

1hbmewl,https://www.reddit.com/r/lordhuron/comments/1hbmewl/strange_trails_the_biggest_yapfest_about_why_this/,Strange trails: The biggest yapfest about why this album is amazing.,"Ok, so because this is already gonna be long, ima keep this short. Strange trails is the best album, and vide noir is a close second. Its overrated, but still so perfect. Im gonna go into depth about each song and why its perfect. Ok intro done  
  
**LOVE LIKE GHOSTS:** A Rollercoaster. The words ""Yes I know, love is like ghosts"" may be some of the most important in LH history. As a intro to an album, its just so perfect. Going from the tame beginning, to the rushing middle, to the beauty of the chorus (i think thats the chorus) make this song just so perfect in every way. This song is history made, and nobody can convince me otherwise. ""do you see no ghosts in me at all?"" generally gives me chills every time I hear it. For this song alone, I may have never been a lord huron fan, just because of how perfectly It was made. Then, after a beautiful transition...

  
**UNTIL THE NIGHT TURNS:** Not many peoples favorite, but still a goodie. This song is just an under performer compared to the rest of the album. It felt way to fast paced, and I just feel like its gets a little annoying and repative after awhile. Looking on the bright side, the beat of the song is really nice, and I like the pacing of the beat, but not the lyrics. A perfect 6/10. QUICK SIDE NOTE: Transitions are really what make part of this album so good. All the songs blend so well together. So, one again, after a great transtion..

  
**DEAD MANS HAND:** A story well told. The pacing of this song works SO. WELL. Every lyric, every beat, EVERYTHING, blends so well together. Its like the perfect cup of coffee, when made right, you just love life. There feels so little to say about this song, because its just the defnention of amazing. The lyrics tell a trippy story, the beat matches well, and the little harmonica solo at the end just sells it.

**HURRICANE (JOHNNIE'S THEME.):**  Who the fuck is johnnie? Hate all you want, but I do NOT know much of the lore for lord huron. I want to learn, but it is SO CONFUSING. Besides the lore, this song is just a fell good song. I dont really remeber the lyrics, but it really just does feel like you want to clap along. The start comes out of nowhere, but it works so well with the rest of the song. I like it so much, because it feels so unquie to lord huron, while still feeling like them.

  
**LA BELLE FLEUR SAUVAGE:** Whats with lord huron and the French language? This song is a bit to slow for my pace, but I still love it. I dont truly get the lyrics for this one, but I can tell the passion behind it, and I understand why people like it. ""Id give it all to love that girl"" is such a beautiful verse, whlie also being simplistic. It feels pure, genuine. Also way to long. Sorry, Not sorry. 

  
**FOOL FOR LOVE:** I... hate this song. I have no idea why, but I hate this song with a burning passion. Sorry, but my opnion isnt vaild. Next.

  
**THE WORLD ENDER:** The best song on the album, hands down. I crave to feel what the song makes me feel, a burning, fiery passion of mahaham and destruction for no real good reason. The fair, the brave, the good must die. Its that simple. This song is just such a kicker, and there is no reason why. It has no reason to be this good. You cant really tell how the song is gonna go from the start, but once you hear that shout, you know what your in for. I think I semi understand the lore of this, as Ive read the comic, and it just makes me love it even more. I know the rules of the gang. I cant understand why, but this song is just such a rush, and it makes me so pumped, and the ending is just as satisfying. 

  
**MEET ME IN THE WOODS:** Oh my gosh is that a curse word??? This song sits with me so well, because of just because I can realte. Call me cringe, but sometiems it really does feel like darkness has a grip on me, and I just wanna run away to the woods, be free a little bit. The chours works so nice here too, along with the voice in the background, and the length fits here. This song is the When the night is over of strange trails, and I really cant praise it enough.

**THE YAWNING GRAVE:** A great change of pace. This song kinda cuts you off. The past 5 songs have been relatively upbeat, semi fast passed, and just feel full of life. This song, takes that away, but that isnt necessarily a bad thing. It leaves you confused, then almost afraid. You feel like you truly have opend the yawning grave, and I can imgaine death itself giving this speech to a victim. I know its not death in the song. Im still not learning the lore. This song has so much life while having none, making it one of the more unique songs, while still managing to pull off perfection. And hey, were back to great trasntions.

**FROZEN PINES:** I wanna run away to the woods. This song just feels so calming. It feels like Im just walking through trees, deep into the woods, looking for her on a bright winter day. I feel confused, but at peace. ""I will wait for you, on the other side of the frozen pines"" is such a nice verse, because its impactful, without being to loud to make an impact- its just a good verse. There truly is another life beyond the line. Its in my top 10, but im still struggling to find things to say about it. Then, one of the worser transtions and we are into:

  
**CURSED:** What? Maybe my brain is to small, but this song confuses me. I like how we are sticking with the slower pace songs, and very slowly picking up the pase. I think it confuses me because I dont know the lore all to well. I mean, perssonaly, I have never been drugged by a woman to be stuck under her curse. *Yet.* Maybe try saying it backwards? Otherwise, I love this song, and its pacing is great, but lyrics are confusing.

**WAY OUT THERE:** Love like ghosts type situation. This song starts off slow paced, but has that same amazing part around the end, making it feel just balanced. The lyrics and beat are less impactful, but the beat feels more powerful, but takes a little longer to appear. Plus they dropped the album in the lyrics so funny ha ha. The upbeat middle feels so out of left field, but manages to still feel so at home. They could have made it a little more faced paced, and it would have felt perfect. Also, this is a major pet peve, but this song does this thing where you think its wrapping up, but really its just a break in the song, which Im not a fan of. But otherwise, great song. Then, the best transtion in the album into

  
**LOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUISA:**  A perfect yin yang. This song has balanced the middle of feling faced passed, while also being slow enough to fall asleep too. The song makes me want to try and find someone out there for me, it just goes to show how this song makes you feel. It what love feels like, in my eyes. ""I feel alive when im with you, baby!"" just proves my point. Im to tired of typing so were are just moving to:

**THE NIGHT WE MET:** The worst, best song of the album. In my eyes, this is the 7th best song on the album. But for some reason, everybody seems to live it. That some reason is my 13th reason why. This song ruins the small community we have about the band, but also, we wouldnt be here without it. 90% of us proabaly wouldnt have been here without the night we mets succes.

I’ve done it myself; I’m not saying it’s a negative thing, and for most people it’s more likely the truth. 

But does anyone else feel ugly? Like their exes and relationships were flukes and you were lucky just to find them and you’re not even sure there will be a next? 

I’ve only had two relationships. My first was an alcoholic so I feel like that’s the only way he tolerated me and I don’t even know where to start with my recent one, other than I truly loved him and thought he was “the one”, that somehow won the lottery with him, but I guess, looking back, we were pretty dysfunctional. 

I’m only getting older. I’m 40 next year. If I was so undesirable in my 20s/30s I feel like dating in my 40s is going to be even harder. I don’t even have my “prime” to fall back on. 

I’m so scared for the future. I’m trying to work on myself, but I’m starting to feel a time crunch now. I don’t want kids or anything, but I’m feeling this need and this pressure to be settled already. Maybe because I thought, until recently, I was. 

I just don’t want to spend my life alone. I have one friend that keeps riding me that romantic love isn’t the only important relationship in life, and while I love my friends, I want my person to come home to, to snuggle on the couch and watch a movie with. None of my friends even live near me so I can’t even do that platonically with anyone. I have no one to run out to the movies with, grab coffee with, go shopping with, I have no one to come home to (except my cat, and I love her to death), but I have no one to hold me when I’m sad, I have no one to turn to when I’m excited about something. I just have no one to share my life with and that’s all I really want, especially realizing other things aren’t working out for me the way I wanted them to like career, etc. Just this one thing, for me.

1hbmdax,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hbmdax,"The sound of snow flowers, Pyeongchang is at its best in winter","If you visit Pyeongchang in the winter, you must visit Daegwallyeong. Daegwallyeong, which is the standard for dividing Gangwon-do into Yeongseo and Yeongdong, is a rare highland area in Korea and boasts an exotic atmosphere. The main element that completes the scenery of Daegwallyeong is the ranch. Representative places include Samyang Round Hill, Sky Ranch, and Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch. 


Samyang Round Hill, which changed its name from Samyang Ranch last year, is considered the largest ranch in Korea. It is a nature-friendly ranch where cows and sheep graze freely on a wide organic pasture, and offers various things to enjoy such as feeding sheep or ostriches, and themed walking trails. If you visit Samyang Round Hill in the winter, you will not be able to see the signature program, the sheep herding performance, or livestock running around the meadow, but you can enjoy the romance of the ranch covered in white snow instead. A huge wind turbine is added to the summit, adding a dot to the snowy scenery. After seeing the ranch, it is perfect to finish it off with a bowl of Samyang Ramen at the mart. 


 Established in 1974 and opened to the public since 2014, Sky Ranch is famous as a music video filming location for famous idols such as Blackpink’s “Lovesick Girls,” Tomorrow X Together’s “You and I Found in the Sky at 5:53,” NCT U’s “From Home,” and Stray Kids’ “The View.” That means the scenery is guaranteed. You can comfortably tour the ranch on the trademark tractor carriage. 


Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch is smaller than Samyang Round Hill and Sky Ranch, but its pastoral scenery with gentle ridges is impressive. The wooden huts are a definite highlight. Here are three must-do things at Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch in the winter: taking a picture of your life in front of the hut, feeding the “cute” sheep at the experience center, and having a warm cup of coffee next to the large wood-burning stove in the store!",1,1733894453.0,KoreaSeoul,0,1.0,False

So basically they’ve unilaterally altered ALL drink recipes containing ANY KIND of syrup by halving the amount of pumps.

This is ridiculous. They already charge an astronomical amount for not-so-great coffee, but now they need to extract EVEN MORE MONEY out of paying customers?

“I’ll be back soon,” she said, as she kissed my cheek.  
Thirty years together, what could go wrong?  
I didn’t know that moment would be our last song.  

The call came quick, the words came slow,  
A drunk behind the wheel, swerving below.  
Her car was crushed, her light snuffed out,  
And I was left in a storm of doubt.  

The road stole her breath, left me alone,  
A broken heart in a splintered home.  
Her chair is empty, her laughter still,  
And I’m lost in a grief no time can kill.  

I wasn’t there to hold her hand,  
To catch her soul as it left this land.  
Did she cry my name as the dark pulled near?  
Did she feel me whisper, “I’m still here”?  

Thirty years, and she was my life,  
Not just my love, she was my light.  
Now I wander the ruins of what we were,  
A man undone, forever hers.  

Her scent clings faint to her favorite dress,  
I press it to my face and confess  
That I scream at God, I rage at fate,  
For taking her and leaving this hate.  

The mornings mock me, they rise the same,  
But they burn with the weight of her name.  
Her coffee mug still sits by the sink,  
Her lipstick stain now makes me shrink.  

I curse the man who drank that night,  
Who turned my joy into endless night.  
But no matter my rage, no matter my pain,  
It won’t bring her back. It’s all in vain.  

Thirty years of her hand in mine,  
Of shared sunsets and borrowed time.  
I would trade it all for one last word,  
One final laugh, one ""I love you"" heard.  

Now my life is a hollow shell,  
Each step an echo, each breath a hell.  
Her ring still rests where it always will. On her side of the bed, where time stands still.  

And someday, when this grief takes me too,  
I’ll find her waiting, beyond the blue.  
Until then, I’m a man torn apart,  
Living with death, and her in my heart.  ",2,1733894363.0,widowers,4,1.0,False

Well, a little background, my 'home' is apparel. I know it, I run it fast and I get left alone. So, I'm happy. But, Cap2 processing has been so bad. Like all week and then some, there has been issues. There was coffee and water spilled into breakpacks and totes throughout 3 pallets. There was actually a pool of water in one of the totes. And two half and mostly empty water bottles in it. Plus, there was a small puddle of coffee on the floor after I pulled the pallets out somehow(i don't have a picture, i just cleaned because I was done)

Regardless, it's been bad. I continuously get homelines(yesterday I had a six wheeler amount to take over there.) I've gotten toothpaste, hair brushes, etc. 

Tonight, two of the processors and another cap2 were behind the apparel bins, hiding, sitting on overstock freight pallets, on their phone and talking. So, while I was finishing pulling out my pallets, I asked if they had a team lead or somwthing tonight. They didn't. One was on leave and one was off. I mentioned that there was a group of cap2 gathering around the apparel bins. Idk if anything happened or what. But part of me feels bad and a part of me is like whatever, fuck it.

TLDR: Phentermine/Topiramate works as an appetite suppressant. Its been working for me. But you have to make sure you’re eating at a deficit if you want to lose weight. 

I started on phentermine 15mg back in early September. I did a whole month of it and definitely noticed a good amount of appetite suppression. I cooked almost all my meals and counted calories for 2 weeks. Then I went back to takeout/DoorDash and ended up gaining weight. This explains why I have two starting weights. 

For the second cycle, I went on phentermine 15mg and topiramate 100mg (started on 25mg and increased biweekly). This cycle started mid October and has been ongoing. I have to say, I have been way more disciplined as well. I’ve counted calories and cooked at least 95% of my meals. I’ve been eating on a deficit and the results are here. I’ve lost 20 lb. Old clothes are starting to fit again. The topiramate has definitely helped with the appetite suppression. I feel less hungry than when I was taking phentermine by itself. I plan on taking them for 2 more months and see where I’m at.

Regarding side effects, topiramate slowed me down a bit at first but its getting better with time. I lost words a few times but that’s no longer happening. It helps me relax a little bit now which I welcome it. I’m still thirsty all the time. Phentermine gives a nice boost at the morning which I welcome since I’m not a morning person.

Ten minutes later I was in the same coffee shop I had been in before the chapel; this time, with conviction.

I sat behind a small bible study group, reading Principles by Ray Dalio. I wasn't troubled, and I sensed interest from some members of the bible study. This was good for me. My psychiatrist would be pleased.

That evening, my Mom -- I live in her house, as a thirty-something who achieved some fame quite young, failed to profit from it, and moved back home -- was quite cold to my newfound conviction. My father was more interested in my pep and enthusiasm, but was sick. I retreated to my room.

Seeing the Bible on the coffee table of my den, I was seized with religious panic. It was probably also the antipsychotic I had taken. I always felt shaken by it.

I prayed in a frenzy, my cold heart feeling colder. And eventually, I slept.

The next day I found myself lying in a grassy field in the Marina. Too much coffee?

Back in the car, I curled upon the fully-reclined seat. The air conditioning on full, I began to believe something bizarre. I needed to drive home, I decided. I needed to be away from anything that might injure me.

By the time I got home, I was acting like a regarded person. My conscience kept blaspheming God, but my mouth kept asking Jesus for help, and vice versa. I needed to believe that Jesus would save me, in order to stop. I banged my head on the floor.

By degrees, I found myself drowning in my tortured misery. ""God, why have you forsaken me?""

A few minutes later I had discovered... something. Important. I prayed to God in the name of Jesus to take away my free will, to control my heart, my mind, my soul. Something happened; I became convinced it worked.

Being free from free will, I walked around the house, rapping and cussing. I ate ice cream sandwiches. I went against my psychiatrist's recommendation, taking adderall for the first time in two weeks. I masturbated. I posted on Bombstrap.

I was once cowed by a looming God; now I am set free by His Mercy. Some will say this is bipolar, but it is not: the prayer came first.

Now I believe. I believe that my nights will be easier, and my life will be more toward, now.

The world is a play, and I have to play a certain role. Whatever I think my role is, that is what I will do. I honestly believe God has chosen me to be free in Him. And so I am.",2,1733893681.0,Bombstrap,0,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.askamanager.org/2024/08/my-company-secretly-gives-parents-thousands-of-extra-dollars-in-benefits.html)  **Aug 13, 2024**


I work for an organization that prides itself on being generous and flexible to parents. I fully support that, despite the usual gripes among the childless employees you might imagine (e.g., we are asked to work more weekends and nights). A colleague of mine, a parent, is leaving the org and invited me to coffee. I thought it was just to have a farewell chat, but it turns out they feel that the difference in parent vs. non-parent benefits is so drastic they “don’t feel right” leaving without telling someone. They let me know how stark the difference is and … it’s way beyond anything I’ve seen before. 

It turns out parents in my org are offered, when they are hired or become parents, are offered a special benefits package called “Family Benefits.” This is not in any paperwork I have access to (including my onboarding work and employee handbook) and those who partake are asked to not share information about it with non-parents, ostensibly to “avoid any tension” with childless employees. But the real reason is far more clear: it’s because they don’t want us to know how bad the difference is: 

* The Family Package includes 10 extra days of PTO (three sick, two personal, five vacation). 

* We have access to specific facilities (gym, pool, etc.) and the Family Benefits package gives free gym membership and swim lessons to you, your spouse, and your children; I can only get those at a 50% discount, and my spouse gets no discount at all. 

* Officially, we’re a “one remote day a week” organization; those with children are allowed to be remote any time schools are out (this includes staff members whose kids aren’t school-age yet, and the entire summer). 

* We have several weekend/evening events we volunteer for, where volunteering gives you comp time; if you’re a parent who volunteers and calls out day-of due to childcare, you still get your comp day (as you might imagine, every event usually has about 25-30 people call out due to childcare). If the special event is child-focused, parents are exempt from volunteering and can attend with their family as guests, and they still get comp time. 

* There’s an affiliate discount program that includes discounts to major businesses not offered to child-free employees — not just child-specific businesses, but movie theaters, ride-sharing apps, and chain stores. 

* We get a card we can add pre-tax commuting funds to, but parents in this program get a bonus $100 a month. 

* We get retirement matching up to 2.5%, but parents get up to 5%. 

* If you need to leave to pick up kids from school, you don’t have to work once you get home; as you might imagine, when given written permission to pass tasks off to others and log off at 2:30 pm, almost everyone does. 

All told, my colleague estimates that as a parent of two children, they saved upwards of $18,000 worth a year in benefits that are not available to me, in addition to the non-monetary benefits (like time saved not having to commute any time schools are out, basically free comp time). 

I’m all for flexibility for parents but knowing that my organization is secretly (SECRETLY) giving parents this volume of bonus benefits has me feeling disgusted at my org and disappointed in my colleagues who have kept it quiet. How do I approach this? Do I reach out to HR? Do I pretend it never happened and move forward? Is this even legal? I’m already planning to leave, and was considering telling my fellow child-free colleagues before I left, but right now I’m just feeling so lost.


[Update](https://www.askamanager.org/2024/12/update-my-company-secretly-gives-parents-thousands-of-extra-dollars-in-benefits.html)  **Dec 4, 2024 (4 months later)** 

Thanks to you and everyone in the comments for, before anything else, validating my opinions that this is bananas! A few notes/answers: 

The child-free staff obviously noticed a lot of these things! Most of them, even! We just didn’t assume “our organization’s supervisors are running a secret benefits club” because that would be insane, right?!? Ha. To give some examples, most colleagues with kids made one weekly appearance in the office during the summer, so we attributed the extra remote days to their managers being nice, not a formal policy exemption. We’d see coworkers attend events as guests (and loved when they believed in our events enough to bring their families!) but we didn’t know they still got comp time. Honestly, the only people who took 100% advantage of every perk offered, no questions asked, were independently known to be … asshats. My favorite example: my boss is universally loathed in the office — they’re the kind of person who emails you projects on Saturday night, texts you about it on Sunday morning, then yells at you if it’s not done Monday morning before they hand me all their work to leave the office at 2 pm. The office has lovingly nicknamed them “NWC” for “No White Clothes” because you’ll never see them in the office between Memorial Day and Labor Day. 

Someone in the comments questioned how the child-free managers felt about this and it helped me realize that every single person in the C-suite and director level had kids, as did probably two-thirds of the manager level. Most of the managers who didn’t have kids living with them were older empty-nesters who did have kids under their roof at one point, too. I honestly couldn’t think of a single parent who didn’t report to another parent. But I doubt that had anything to do with these policies (*rolls eyes as high as possible*). I should say, that didn’t impact who did or didn’t get promoted into certain roles: parents and non-parents alike were deservedly hired or promoted from within; it did obviously impact which supervisor was assigned to which person. 

Yes, apparently if you have your first child while working there, you then get told about the “expanded benefits packages to accommodate your new family.” It seems the colleagues are so pleasantly surprised at all the benefits they aren’t retroactively angry (or maybe they are and feel it’s better to keep the secret). 

We do have a small, understaffed HR department. One person who is basically the liaison between us and a PEO for benefits and payroll, and a director who mostly does interviews and handles complaints. Both parents. 

To try and fix this (especially because I had been regularly interviewing to leave and didn’t want to do it alone in the event I got a new job and left it behind), I spoke to some trusted colleagues, one a parent and two child-free. The colleague who was a parent, I also learned, had joined as a parent and was not given a big “don’t tell the others” speech, it was just suggested they have discretion around benefits so we don’t “let money get in the way of teamwork.” The two child-free colleagues had no idea about this and were enraged. The four of us met and, the Monday after your answer, put together some language and emailed our HR department and managers to outline that we knew about the benefits differences and were 100% prepared to publicly share with the full organization and an employment lawyer if they did not work to balance out the benefits, or at least publicize the differences so non-parents can choose whether or not they want to work here. I got a response that they’d “be looking into it” and suddenly a number of directors and managers (including my boss), the C-suite, HR, and some board members were meeting for hours at a time that week. 

That Friday, an email went out that basically said benefits would be changing to “match the changing needs of our organization.” However, it didn’t acknowledge previous differences. Generally it meant that non-parents got the extra time off, comp days are only given if you complete a volunteer shift, and we would have a universal in-office day of Wednesday during the summers, but be remote the other four days. However, some benefits weren’t changing: you were still only eligible for family gym memberships if you had kids (“there is no couples membership at Organization,” so non-families were just SOL), leaving early without taking PTO was only for school pickups, and no announced change to our retirement benefits. 

If not happy with the response (we weren’t!), my colleagues and I were planning to tell everyone, but we didn’t even have to. Sadly I missed this while out of town for a wedding, but apparently a parent in the office got this email just before entering a Zoom. He didn’t realize there were some non-parents already logged on and said out loud to another parent something along the lines of “Did anyone else see this? I don’t get it, it’s just our benefits but now I have to be in on Wednesdays!” Cue the questions, cue the firestorm, cue everyone being told to log off and go home at noon on a Friday. 

Since then, multiple people have quit out of pure rage (incluidng some parents who were also told to have discretion and were disgusted with the org), the C-level exec who originally spearheaded these benefits resigned, and all the non-parents have collectively agreed to refuse to go in the office until everything is more equal. Almost every benefit that was given to parents will now be offered org-wide (they are even creating a couples’ gym membership) but, interestingly, they have not touched the one thing that seemed to rile up the comments section the most: retirement matching! Apparently, because families with kids spend more money, and the changing economy means more young adults need financial support from their parents in their 20’s, parents need more money in retirement to make up for it. This is a sticking point the non-parents are really fighting against, and the org seems to be adamant they won’t budge on. 

Lucky for me, the reason I’m not joining them in that good fight is that I’m writing this having submitted my two weeks. Found an interesting new job (and used your advice on interviews and in negotiations) and submitted my notice. There was still some drama: My aforementioned asshat boss NWC responded by taking multiple projects away from my fellow non-parents, saying “they can’t do it while on their remote strike” and assigning them to me (~120 hours of group work to be done alone in 10 working days). Extra lucky for me, I have a family member and a college friend who are both employment lawyers; they helped me craft an email saying that because I’ve been assigned an unreasonable amount of work on an impossible timeline after being a whistleblower for the benefits issue, I could and would sue for retaliation. An hour later I got a call from HR letting me know that my work had been reassigned and that once I’d finished editing an exit doc for my successor, I could log off permanently and still be paid for the full notice period and get my vacation payouts. Currently basking in the glow of paid funemployment. (When I’m done writing this, my wife and I are going to get drinks and lunch! At 2 in the afternoon! On a Tuesday!) 

Thanks again to the comments for the suggestions and making me feel less like a bewildered baboon, and to you for your sage advice with this question and so many others! I’m aware of my privilege in having understanding colleagues and literally being able to text two employment lawyers and get good, pro bono advice within a day. Not everyone has that, so thank you for providing the resource.

=====================================================

*""Discover the SECRET of Fresh breath for Dog https://freepage.pro/samutores/dogfresh""*

When it comes to our furry friends, nothing can be quite as disheartening as bad breath. It’s like a hidden monster lurking beneath their wagging tails and joyful barks, ready to strike at the most inopportune moments. If your dog's breath smells like a dumpster behind a fast-food restaurant, you're not alone. Many pet owners face this olfactory challenge, leading to awkward moments when that adorable pup leans in for a kiss. But worry not! Enter dog mints for bad breath—a delicious solution that helps combat those foul odors while giving your pup an extra treat.

In this article, we’ll delve into the causes of bad breath in dogs, how dog mints work, and why they can be a game-changer in your pet care routine. Buckle up; it’s going to be a fresh ride!

Understanding the Culprits Behind Bad Breath in Dogs
----------------------------------------------------

Before we dive into the world of dog mints, let’s explore the reasons behind your pup's less-than-pleasant mouth odor. It’s essential to understand what’s brewing in their mouth before we can tackle the problem.

### Common Causes of Bad Breath in Dogs

Several factors can contribute to your dog's bad breath, including:

1. **Poor Oral Hygiene:** Just like us, dogs require regular dental care. If their teeth aren’t brushed often, plaque builds up, turning into tartar and leading to gum disease.
2. **Diet and Food Choices:** Some foods might lead to foul breath. Think of it this way: if you were munching on something rotten, your breath wouldn’t smell like a bouquet of roses either!
3. **Health Issues:** Sometimes, persistent bad breath might indicate underlying health concerns such as kidney disease, diabetes, or gastrointestinal issues. If your dog’s breath suddenly changes, it’s best to consult your vet.
4. **Foreign Objects:** Believe it or not, dogs are notorious for chewing on things they shouldn't! A stray piece of food or even a toy stuck between their teeth could lead to unpleasant odors.
5. **Dry Mouth:** If your dog isn’t drinking enough water, their saliva production decreases, causing a dry mouth, which can lead to bad breath.

So, what can we do about it? That’s where dog mints come into play!

The Magic of Dog Mints for Bad Breath
-------------------------------------

Now that we've tackled the nitty-gritty of why your pup's breath might smell worse than a gym sock, let’s talk about the magic of dog mints. They’re more than just a sweet treat; they’re a powerful ally in the battle against bad breath.

### What Are Dog Mints?

Dog mints are specially formulated treats designed to freshen your dog's breath while promoting oral health. These mints often contain natural ingredients, herbs, and other substances that help fight bacteria responsible for unwanted odors. Think of them as little green warriors that charge into the battlefield of your dog’s mouth, combating bad breath one mint at a time.

### How Do Dog Mints Work?

Dog mints work through a combination of freshening ingredients and mechanical action. Here’s what goes down:

- **Bacterial Combat:** Many dog mints include chlorophyll or peppermint oil, both known to reduce bacterial growth in the mouth.
- **Mechanical Cleaning:** The act of chewing the mints can help scrape away some plaque and tartar, helping keep your dog’s teeth cleaner than if they were to merely swallow their food whole.
- **Freshening Agents:** These mints usually have breath-freshening flavors, which work wonders to make that canine kiss a bit more pleasant. You could say they sprinkle a little magic on your pup's breath.

Benefits of Using Dog Mints for Bad Breath
------------------------------------------

You might be thinking, “Sure, dog mints sound great, but what are the real benefits?” Well, let’s break it down!

### 1. Enhanced Oral Health

Regular use of dog mints can contribute to better overall dental hygiene for your pet. A fresher mouth means fewer visits to the vet for dental cleanings!

### 2. Easy to Use

Dog mints are simple to incorporate into your dog’s routine. Just toss one or two their way daily, and voilà! Easy peasy.

### 3. Treat with Purpose

With dog mints, you can reward your pet for good behavior while addressing a pesky problem. Who doesn’t love multitasking?

### 4. Affordable Solution

Compared to frequent vet visits for dental cleanings or specialized diets meant to combat bad breath, dog mints can be an economical choice. It’s like the difference between buying a latte every day versus making coffee at home.

### 5. Requires No Extreme Measures

Unlike some drastic measures (like brushing your dog’s teeth every single day, which let’s be honest, can be a battle), dog mints provide a manageable approach to keeping that breath in check.

Choosing the Right Dog Mints
----------------------------

Alright, now that we’ve established the wonders of dog mints for bad breath, how do you choose the right ones? With so many options on the market, it can feel a bit overwhelming!

### Consider Your Dog’s Size and Breed

When selecting dog mints, keep your dog’s size in mind. Larger breeds may require larger mints, while tiny pups might need a smaller size. Always opt for treats that fit their little mouths properly.

### Opt for Natural Ingredients

Look for dog mints that boast natural ingredients. Avoid artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives whenever possible. Your pup deserves the best, after all!

### Check the Reviews

Don’t just take the brand's word for it; read reviews and testimonials from other dog owners. If others rave about how the mints worked wonders for their pets, chances are they’ll do the same for yours!

### Consult Your Vet

If you’ve got concerns about specific ingredients or how they’ll affect your pooch, don’t hesitate to consult your veterinarian. They might have recommendations on which products to try.

Beyond Mints: Comprehensive Dental Care for Your Dog
----------------------------------------------------

While dog mints for bad breath are fantastic, they shouldn't be the only tool in your arsenal. An all-around dental care regimen will go a long way in keeping your dog's mouth healthy. Let’s explore some additional practices that pair well with those minty miracles.

### Regular Teeth Brushing

If you can manage it, brushing your dog’s teeth on a regular basis is one of the best ways to promote oral health. Use toothpaste specifically designed for dogs—never human toothpaste, as it can be harmful to them. Aim for at least 2-3 times a week, but daily is ideal!

### Dental Chews

In addition to mints, consider dental chews. They come in various shapes and sizes, designed to reduce plaque and tartar while providing a tasty snack for your dog.

### Professional Cleanings

Regular professional dental cleanings at your vet’s office are vital. These deep cleans can catch problems early and maintain your dog’s overall health.

### Fresh Water Availability

Always ensure your pup has access to fresh, clean water. Hydration is key in preventing dry mouth, which can contribute to bad breath.

### Healthy Diet

A balanced and nutritious diet not only supports your dog’s overall health but also helps maintain better breath. Consult with your vet about the best dietary options for your furry friend.

Fun Alternatives to Dog Mints
-----------------------------

While dog mints are marvelous, there are other fun alternatives that can contribute to fresher breath. Let’s take a peek!

### 1. Natural Chew Toys

Certain chew toys can help clean your dog’s teeth as they gnaw away. Look for toys designed specifically for dental care.

### 2. Fruits and Vegetables

Some fruits and veggies are safe for dogs and can naturally freshen breath. Carrots and apples are excellent options!

### 3. Coconut Oil

Believe it or not, coconut oil can aid in freshening breath. A small amount mixed into their food can do wonders, plus it’s packed with nutrients!

### 4. Fresh Herbs

Adding parsley or mint to your dog’s food can work wonders for their breath. Just a pinch here and there can really pack a punch.

### 5. Homemade Breath Fresheners

If you're feeling crafty, you can create your own dog-safe breath-freshening treats! Recipes abound online, and they often include ingredients like oats, peanut butter, and the aforementioned herbs.

Signs Your Dog Might Need More Than Mints
-----------------------------------------

Sometimes, bad breath isn't just a minor annoyance. If your dog's breath persists despite using dog mints, it might signal something more serious. Here are some signs to watch for:

### 1. Sudden Change in Breath Odor

If there’s an abrupt change in the smell coming from your dog's mouth, it's worth investigating further.

### 2. Red or Bleeding Gums

If you notice your dog’s gums looking red or bleeding, this could indicate periodontal disease.

### 3. Decreased Appetite

If your typically enthusiastic eater shows less interest in food, this might be a sign of dental pain or other health issues.

### 4. Excessive Drooling

If drooling increases more than usual, it can signal discomfort or dental complications.

### 5. Behavioral Changes

Unusual behaviors, like lack of energy or irritability, may indicate that your dog is in pain and should be examined by a vet.

Conclusion: The Fresh Smell of Success
--------------------------------------

In the grand scheme of pet care, managing your dog's breath is just one piece of the puzzle. However, with dog mints for bad breath, you’ve got a potent tool at your disposal to help keep those kisses sweet and enjoyable! By understanding your dog's oral health, maintaining good hygiene, and using dog mints, you can help ensure your furry friend not only stays healthy",1,1733893251.0,FreshBreathChampion,0,1.0,False

Seeing the transformative effects of teeth whitening through before and after results can inspire you to take the plunge. You might be wondering how much difference a whiter smile can make in your life.

When you embark on a teeth whitening journey, the first step usually involves assessing your current tooth shade. With various treatments available, consumers can choose professional dental services or over-the-counter products.

### Types of Teeth Whitening Methods

There are several popular methods for whitening your teeth. Here are some of the most common:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Whitening:** This is performed by dentists using high-concentration bleaching agents. The process is quick, often yielding noticeable results in just one session.
- **At-Home Kits:** Many people prefer to use at-home kits that contain lower concentrations of bleaching agents. These can take longer to show full results but offer more flexibility.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** Brushing with specially formulated toothpaste can help remove surface stains, but significant whitening might take some time.
- **Whitening Strips:** These are adhesive strips coated with a whitening gel. They are easy to apply and can produce good results over a few days or weeks.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some individuals turn to natural options like baking soda or activated charcoal. However, results can vary, and it's essential to use these carefully to avoid damaging your enamel.

### What to Expect Before and After Teeth Whitening

Before starting any whitening treatment, you might have various questions. Many individuals feel uncertain about what to expect. Here's a breakdown of what typically happens:

#### Before Treatment

1\. **Consultation:** It's essential to consult with a dentist to evaluate if you’re a suitable candidate for teeth whitening. They will check your tooth health and determine the best method for you.

Comparing Professional Teeth Whitening vs. At-Home Solutions: Outcomes and Experiences
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're considering brightening your smile, you might be weighing the options between professional teeth whitening and at-home solutions. Each method offers distinct benefits and outcomes that can significantly impact your smile. Let’s dive into the comparisons, along with the experiences you can expect.

### Understanding Professional Teeth Whitening

When you choose professional teeth whitening, you're opting for treatment provided by a dentist. This method often uses stronger bleaching agents compared to what you can find over the counter. Here's what to expect:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Immediate Results:** Most patients notice their teeth getting several shades whiter in just one session.
- **Customized Treatment:** Your dentist can tailor the procedure to your needs. They can focus on specific areas that might need extra attention.
- **Enhanced Safety:** With professional supervision, the risk of gum irritation and other side effects is minimized.
- **Longer Lasting Effects:** Generally, teeth whitening done by a professional lasts longer compared to at-home kits.

### Experiences of Professional Treatments

Many patients report a high level of satisfaction after professional whitening. The experience can vary but typically includes:

- **Comfort:** Dentists often ensure that you're comfortable during the procedure, sometimes offering help if sensitivity occurs.
- **Efficiency:** Professional treatments are usually completed within an hour, making them convenient for those on the go.
- **Follow-up Care:** Dentists provide guidance on how to maintain your bright smile post-treatment.

### Exploring At-Home Teeth Whitening Solutions

On the other hand, at-home teeth whitening options are widely available and can be both convenient and cost-effective. These include whitening strips, trays, gels, and toothpaste. Here are some aspects to consider:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Accessibility:** At-home products are easy to find in drugstores or online.
- **Cost-Effective:** Generally, these options are more affordable than professional treatments.
- **Flexibility:** You can choose your own schedule, allowing for treatments that fit into your lifestyle.
- **Varied Results:** The effectiveness can vary widely depending on the product used and your specific teeth.

### Experiences with At-Home Products

Users often have mixed experiences with at-home solutions. Some enjoy favorable results, while others may struggle. Here’s what you might encounter:

- **Time Commitment:** At-home treatments often require multiple applications over weeks to see noticeable results.
- **Potential Sensitivity:** Many users report gum sensitivity, especially if products aren't used as directed.
- **Discomfort:** Some methods, like trays, can be uncomfortable and may not fit well in the mouth.

### A Comparison of Outcomes

Both professional and at-home teeth whitening can enhance the brightness of your smile, but the results differ. Here’s a brief comparison:

Ultimately, your choice between professional teeth whitening and at-home solutions depends on your individual needs, budget, and time commitment. Each method has its strengths and can lead to a more brilliant smile. Whether you prefer the quick results of a dentist or the convenience of an at-home kit, you can achieve a brighter smile that boosts your confidence.

Consider consulting with a dental professional to discuss which option might be best for you, particularly if you have dental concerns or sensitive teeth. With proper care and the right choice, a sparkling smile can be just around the corner!

I'm no hermit, but I wish we had more quality time together without having to always ask her to squeeze me in.

The long version:

I am feeling very lost and don't know what to do. My fiancee (32F) is a strong, independent person who prides herself on being well-rounded and engaged in lots of things. I love this about her (or at least I think I do?!) but I'm worried that it is taking a toll on me and our relationship. She is constantly scheduling social gatherings with friends — sometimes 3x per day (breakfast in the morning with a new girl-friend, hike in the afternoon with her best guy-friend, dinner in the evening with her old friends from elementary school) — and that's in addition to working full-time. She makes her own work schedule and often hangs with friends mid-day, sometimes hanging with the same people 2 or 3 times per week. This all adds up to a LOT of socializing, which, between work and seeing her family once or twice a week, sometimes has her schedule ""stacked"" 10-12 hours per day.

Then there's me. I am newer to this city, a bit older, and so many of my friends have ""nested"" or, being men, are a little less emotionally open / harder to bond with / schedule a casual coffee or hike with. I work a pretty demanding job, which often has me completely occupied from 8-5 each day (not a lot of time to plan fun social events during those hours), but I am pretty good at not over-working and being available for socializing every evening and on weekends. I consider myself an extrovert, or at the very least an introverted extrovert, but my partner's level of socializing makes me feel like a total shut-in. She will generally respond positively if I set up something fun for us to do, but if it involves my friends, she's often less enthused, prioritizing her own events first, always.
So, it's not like I'm being neglected here, but I feel like I'm being ""squeezed"" into her life, like I'm having to advocate for every bit of quality time together.

I will cop to a few things here: I am disabled, and though I'm confident and successful in many respects (in work, my value as a person, my independence in navigating the world, ability to socialize with many different types of people) — I definitely still have insecurities about a few things: I don't drive; I don't want to be a burden; and I have some general social anxiety about being included/invited to things. . I have some trauma around being left-out/not being able to play sports with my friends as a young kid, so being excluded is a big trigger. There's definitely some rejection sensitivity there; I can admit I have anxiety around being rejected or shut down. But it doesn't stop me from trying and I do have plenty of friends who I see regularly. My friends are great — I often have 4-5 great social engagements per week, and I love them. But compared with her 15-20, I end up spending a lot of time at home in the evenings or weekends feeling lonely. I love being included and invited along, but I'm only invited to about 20% of the socializing she plans and I'm not always available/interested in what she is planning.

I've expressed my frustration / sadness about this to her many times, and she mostly reacts defensively. (She'll say: ""My worst fear is being with someone who is insecure and want's me to be small, doesn't want me to be well-rounded and have a life outside of them — I'm not saying you're that way, but I'm very triggered by you reacting this way to me."") I guess that reaction is fair enough, but even when I'm very raw and vulnerable and just say I'm a bit lonely and jealous that she has so many people available to her at all times, she seems sort of surface-level empathetic but not really prepared to change much.
In her more reflective moments, she has told me things like ""my mom used to tell me I was addicted to socializing"" or even ""I know this is a thing that I need help with, can you please help me balance this with self-care and prioritize our relationship?"" I know she can be very hard on herself, has her own insecurities, and I believe she loves me deeply and wants to figure this out. But it always goes back to the status quo pretty quickly, sometimes the very next day. And then if I try to help as asked, I become like a nagging parent (""Now honey, you just scheduled 12 hours of activities for the day, when are you going to exercise or even bathe?"" lol). I'm tired of being the bad guy, but she seems to really want to placate me and so is always asking if it's ""OK"" if she does things, which makes me uncomfortable.

Then there's the burnout and exhaustion: She is in a helping profession and so when you combine her constantly socializing with the natural burnout of helping others all day long, she is often exhausted, jealous of her time, and angry that ""everyone"" is expecting so much of her. I find this to be a real downer, especially when's she's complaining after a week full of many objectively fun events. I told her today that I had a hard time being empathetic to her frequent burnout symptoms when she voluntarily dedicates so much of her time to others without tending to herself or our relationship. When we do have an hour or two in the evening to chill, she's so exhausted she passes out immediately as soon as the TV is on. Then I'm alone again.

I don't want to make it sound all bad. If I tell her something I'm planning is ""important"" and I want her to cancel her plans and do something with me, she will. Or if I plan far enough ahead, she'll be on board. But that feels like a high bar for me. I'm often met with a ""you just need to invite me to more things,"" which is valid, but it's hard enough to get my late-thirties friends to hang out, combined with the fact that my morale is pretty damaged from feeling like I'm constantly trying to keep up with her and dream up exciting things just so that I'm not alone on a random Tuesday night. We've been dating 4+ years, engaged 6 months, and on all the important things (values, goals, finances) we are aligned. I will admit, when my schedule is packed or I'm traveling, I'm not only OK with her vibrant social life, but I'm grateful for it and happy for her. It's just that my resting state is one that wants a few more ""chill nights at home,"" unstructured time to take care of things around the house, and parallel play where we can feel bonded and leave room for spontaneity/intimacy/who knows what else! I shouldn't compare myself to others but I do feel a little jealous of the more ""nested"" friends, even though if you'd have asked me 5 years ago I would have unequivocally told you I didn't want that, that I wanted someone just like my partner!

One final factor: I think there's a possibility she's neurodivergent / has ADHD. She has floated the idea several times about both of these (often when defending her actions in an argument), but refuses to get formal assessment/seek accommodations for this potential disability. As someone who has gone through adjusting to disability myself this is frustrating because I know I can't force her to face it, but I also know that if this is what's going on, her life could be vastly improved by her owning it. But I don’t know!

What can I do here, how do I tackle my insecurities around her vibrant social life?",2,1733891917.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Packed with over 2,000 powerful bioactive compounds, coffee not only brings freshness and energy but also offers significant health benefits. Regular coffee consumption can lower the risk of heart disease, neuro-related disorders, and other chronic conditions.

The research highlights the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aging properties of coffee, which promote healthy ageing and a strong liver. However, moderation is key, as excessive coffee intake may lead to increased caffeine levels in the body.

Start your day on a healthy and energizing note with a cup of coffee. Keep your body fresh, mind sharp, and heart healthy!

1hbljah,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1hbljah/karen_gets_upset_over_first_come_first_serve_at_a/,"Karen gets upset over ""First come, First serve"" at a coffee shop, end up getting taken down by a cop.","This was about a year ago in the winter one weekend morning . I was waiting for a haircut appt so  I walked nextdoor into a popular coffe shop. The place was busy but not packed all the way. There were 2 people in front of me and shortley a few behind me. The person infront of me had and expensive coat, expensive jewlery, and the whole ""I want to talk to the manager"" look.  She gave her order which took a while, it something like ""Blah blah latte with 2 pumps of this, a little of that, this type of milk, 1 pump of this, and so on"". She was told it may take a few minute and she stood by the other 2 or 3 people waiting for her order. She was asked for the name on the cup to be called out and it was ""Karen"". 

It was my turn to order.I dont need much to make myself happy, I dont need anything complicated. I can sum up myu coffee order in one word ""LARGE"" and some times I have to clarify with ""LARGE AND BLACK"". Surprisingly the guy behind the counter repeated my order and somehow was able to turn it into a full paragraph. ""A large american blah blah with no this, no that, no this, blah blah"".  ""Is that simple large coffee"" ""yes"". The guy turned around took two steps to the the other counter, fills up a cup, I pay and hands it to me, all good. 

I start to walk away with my cup of coffe, when I notice Karen looking at me witha  ""WTF"" look on her face. I see her take two steps to the counter and start the whoe ""I need to speak with a manager"". I stopped to look and watch the scene. The arguement kinda of started with ""Where the hell is my latte and why the hell did the ratty slob behind me get his first? What happend to 'first come, first serve'?"" The guy behind the counter tried to explain the difference between the orders. She was not having it and was getting louder.There was cursing, yelling, and all the fireworks. I see one person who was in the back of the line unzipped his coat, revealing a police uniform, and making his way up to make his presence known.

You now have a manager behind the counter arguing with karen and the cop just stepped in. The cop just tries to get a word in by saying that what she was doing was unreasonable causing a disturbance and its best to calm down. Karen just stopped in shock realizing that the cop is not on her side. Karen: ""What the hell is wrong with you I am a victim here, I payed my good money and I was not serviced. They should be the ones arrested."" Then she started to from shock to back to angry. She said this next part while jabing her finger in the officers chest. "" You need to do"" (JAB)"" your fucking job"" JAB "" amd ares...."" 

The officer grabbed her arm and did a full takdown. Karen was face first into the floor screaming, the offier was reading the miranda arrights. ""You are under arrest for assulting a police officer, disorderly conduct, etc. "". 

The other cop came into the store when he heard the yelling. To help out.  I did ask if they need me to make a statement or something, but they said they have enough.  I just left and didnt follow up. ",287,1733891586.0,EntitledPeople,25,0.93,False

Hi all,

Nice to talk to you all, it's me Noffy T. Coffee, Emiza in game on US server, dorothy3242 on reddit.   
  
On and off during the run of Alchemy Stars I was a fairly regular streamer of the game on my twitch, until I got worn out on streaming. The whole time I stayed a consistent player though, doing things like usually placing top 50 in US codex under the name Emiza up until Velegy came out, etc. You may have seen some of my posts for random memes and stuff floating around this subreddit over the years too.

One of my favorite projects ever was working with Juliet on our previous Astra Archives video ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3\_iL2sibE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3_iL2sibE) ), though we never had a good chance to make follow ups despite quite a few plans and topics to cover. She also made a really impressive sheet of every character's name across languages back then too ( [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CVZPmxul88Q3djRi\_CxQUjpsVBCYQsQY\_0CxYxy3NvI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CVZPmxul88Q3djRi_CxQUjpsVBCYQsQY_0CxYxy3NvI/edit?usp=sharing) ) 

Getting to share team building, dumb comps, pushing codex scores, witnessing geniuses at work in the bethel frankel server, enjoying new characters and stories, everything has been a ton of fun.

Overall, I'm so glad to have gotten to be part of this community with you all.

I have a lot of love for this game, and will miss it dearly. There's so much to learn about it, so many areas of depth and charm, and a unique and fun strategy game element too. For me, it came at an important time in my life when I was stuck working in a dead-end remote teaching job due to COVID-19. Being able to stream regularly was a wonderful way to connect with everyone and actually talk to more people passionate about the same thing as me.

As someone who grew up on the internet, the aspect of Navigator being raised by a machine and its databases of knowledge always resonated with me from the beginning. His growth over the course of the game from very clueless and missing social cues to a bit more confident and heroic was extremely endearing to the end.

Currently I'm left with a lot of miscellaneous information floating in my head about the game, as someone who has obsessively read a lot of it and had plenty of theories. In this last month and a half, I'd like to celebrate what it was and is with you all.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Two personal plans:** 

1. I'll be streaming every Sunday at 11 AM EST (4pm UTC) at [http://twitch.tv/noffynoffeh](http://twitch.tv/noffynoffeh) to finish what I haven't played of the main story chapters 20S and 21 (I always liked to save main story), challenge Pandora's box, spire, and some goofy replays for spire and abyss. If I finish those I'll replay the main story as much as I can for nostalgia's sake :). Challenging Pandora's may be really hard but hopefully those 1k pulls help? haha.

2. I'll be making regular aurorian and astra trivia posts in the coming weeks - some will be more obscure, some will be well known now, others would be more theories of mine, but just sharing some of the knowledge about aurorians in alchemy stars because they were all really cool characters!

People are antsy for more snow.

But Crystal also seems more aloof than usual, and they appear to have made some really odd decisions lately, including the design of the new Mountain Commons space, new early/midweek ops decisions, and there are some oddities with the new parking setup.

**Giving direct feedback is important!** I've given feedback directly to Crystal before on operational questions and they've actually made changes (that season!) as a result. For over 20 years, I've given direct feedback at my (other) home resort and it results in on the ground changes, both in-season and over the long-term. Don't assume that ""they must be hearing these things."" They might not be.

***Ways to give feedback:***

1. Complete every survey you receive from Ikon Pass after a visit. They do actually read these survey results, including if you leave open-ended feedback.
2. Email the resort's inbox at [gservice@skicrystal.com](mailto:gservice@skicrystal.com).
3. Email resort leadership directly. The format for Crystal email addresses is generally (first letter of first name)(last name)@skicrystal.com. Be respectful but give candid feedback. Many resort leaders are perfectly willing to chat in-person on the mountain, too, so offer to grab coffee if you'd actually do that.

1hblfo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1hblfo3/social_media_is_so_dysregulating/,Social media is so dysregulating ,"I took a 3.5 month hiatus from all social media (SM) where I deleted the apps off my phone. I kept messenger for chatting with friends/family and YouTube because it is handy for looking up how-to or tutorial videos. YouTube shorts weren't really an issue either because I seem to only get videos from a few channels and they get quite repetitive so there's no major temptation to keep watching. I can only watch so many Bistro Huddy videos at a time even though I do like his content overall. 

Last week, I decided it would be okay to re-add Instagram and Facebook to my phone because I figured I had broken my addiction after 3.5 months. Oh how wrong I was. Facebook is not particularly enticing and if I do another SM purge, I will probably leave it since I mostly use it for connecting with local community, special interest, and no-buy groups. It's also great for planning events since everyone is on it so I can just invite them, which is what my husband and I did for our wedding. We didn't bother with mailed invitations since we could just add people to the event page and it worked out great. 

Instagram is another story. Last week, I didn't really use it much but these past two days I have been stuck at home with a nasty cold and have been quite bored. Without realizing it, I have resorted to mindlessly scrolling through my feed and just watching endless amounts of reels. I enjoy the content and can look up whatever I want related to my interests such as books, coffee, and sourdough bread. In just 48 hours, it feels like all of the benefits of my SM purge have just gone to the wayside as I am back to square one. 

My attention span is already being impacted and I am struggling to sit down and read. I want to read my book but when I actually try to, my mind is being pulled towards the endless scroll of reels which are instant dopamine and entertainment. I literally set a 45min timer on my phone and had my husband put it on the other side of the room so I could get some reading done.

1hblf3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1hblf3u/too_stressed_to_ask_someone_for_their_number/,Too stressed to ask someone for their number ,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been going to this small family owned coffee shop for a while that is close to my work. I’ve gotten to know this barista who her family actually owns the shop. We chat frequently and she always expresses interests about me/ how I’m doing and we even started talking about our family’s/ upcoming events. 

I’ve been wanting to ask her number for some time, but I can never find the perfect time because there’s typically other customers around and I don’t want to do it in front of others because it would just put her on the spot and would not be ideal. I have been debating going early in the morning as they open(so there’s no other customers around), but also don’t want to seem too intentional/ I’m just coming in for the number even if I’m ordering something. 

I just don’t know what to do and it’s been really weighing on my mind and stressing me out. Part of me is saying is just do it when it feels right because if she’s really into me she’s not gonna say no just because the scenario is not perfect. I also feel like if I wait too long it actually might change her opinion of me cause she might not think I’m interested. 

If I ever do decide to do it I was thinking of saying the following: “While I do enjoy coming here for the coffee, i really enjoy talking to you as you seem to have great and kind personality. I would love to get to know you more and was wondering if I could grab your number?”

Would love thoughts and advice on this

This is gonna be really long and disorganised but I really need to get it off my chest, English also isn't my first language so please bare with me.. 

I cannot deal with this. I just noticed my mom bought herself an urn online.
I am sure my mom suffers from depression in some form or another, it's in her/our family and I just know. My father is SHIT. An absolute SHIT person and I despise him with all my being and she does too and she never left no matter how many times I told her she should if she felt it would be for the best.
My mom has threatened to kill herself ever since I was 5 yo. Mostly when she and dad fought and that has always been a lot. When I started to get older she started to shout it around less often but I can still hear her talk to herself sometimes.
She lost her dad to cancer when she was around my current age, around 20. She started smoking a pack a day ever since and also occasionally drinking. 

I didn't want to talk about me much at first, but I feel this needs some context, so I'll just say even though she's an angel and I love her to death all of this and my dad being what he is has also taken a toll on me for as long as I can remember. We don't talk much in this house. I've never felt safe to leave my room, for years I haven't felt safe in my space either, and I don't have a door. I have suffered from severe depression and am currently going through phases. I developed anorexia years ago, stayed at a bmi of 13-15 for years and then it turned into bulimia and me sneaking out in the middle of the night to throw up in the woods and smoke. I've been self harming since I was 12, managed to get clean for a while, relapsed, fell in love with alcohol and other things, never to the point of having people close to me intervene but definitely to the point of it being harmful-I still need a bottle in my closet at all times in case I need relief. My first relationships were bad and left me some baggage. I have had suicidal thoughts ever since I was around 16. Throughout all of this neither of my parents ever lifted a single finger or tried to talk to me. The best my dad could do was tell me ""I would've never dated your mom if she looked like this, it's disgusting"" when I was at my lowest weight and the pit of my ed. My parents don't believe in mental health even though they so clearly need help as well, so I never got any support whatsoever. I've managed to go to therapy for a few months with my own money and though it helped a tiny bit the therapist clearly wasn't right for me and it also became too hard on my savings and too expensive for my job, so I had to quit. 
I have always felt as if I couldn't talk about these things. My parents never did talk. They haven't slept in the same bed for a decade and they have been fighting always and over everything since I was a toddler, getting me into the crossfire. I am scared to be near them because I am scared they might yell because I know they could, always, at any moment, for whatever reason. I tried to tell my mom I sh once while I was having a crisis and banging my head against a wall and she went on to make coffee and just calmly said ""good for you"". I think that was the moment I completely stopped trying to communicate my issues, goals, achievements-everything important to me. I would love to but I am physically unable. I freeze. I feel like throwing up. I know it's not her fault though and I will always love her to death because I know deep down she really is hurting very much and she's doing her best. 
That's why I'm worried. 
I do my best (..or the best I can, considering my issues in being around and talking to my parents..) to let her know I love her, always. She is my number one person and the one I care about the most. 
I am so fucking goddamn scared of losing her. Ever since I was little I have always gotten anxious whenever I didn't know where she was. In my head she could be somewhere ending it. I have a panick attack every time she is missing. I have to look for her everywhere or I lose it. I am TERRIFIED of what she might do-because I feel so much like her. I go to her room at night sometimes and stand still to check if she's breathing. I have been doing this for a long time. I cannot sleep if I'm not sure she is alive. I am losing my mind. 

Then things got worse. 

She got diagnosed with stage IV CRC a few months ago, is doing okay-ish with chemotherapy atm, main tumor shrank but the liver metastasis grew. The outlook isn't great but we can't know anything for sure yet, she won't share details with me and I only know what I know from my own research and looking at her papers-I'm sorry but I just can't NOT know and asking doesn't yield answers. I know it's curable in some cases, I know it's hard, I know she's responding well to treatment, but that's about it. Her brother on the other hand, my uncle, got diagnosed a few weeks later with lung cancer and he's doing terribly. Doctors gave him about 6 months, we will have to see what happens. Her sister had cancer too but is NED now. Only one of her brothers is healthy. 

The only time she ever opened up to me was when she bursted out crying telling me that she didn't get to see her dad before he died and she is terrified she won't get to see her brother either (we live in different countries). This broke my heart and I reassured her and told her whenever she was cleared to fly I would go with her so they could see each other and that it was going to be fine. But that's the only time she ever told me anything. 

It's been a month and she hasn't made plans and doesn't seem to want to atm or amymore.

I had her phone for a few hours last week because mine broke and while I was searching smth up on Google I saw her recent searches. 
""urns"" ""suicide help"" and many variants of ""pills that guarantee death"" written in her first language. 
I lost my mind. I cried so so much and didn't have anyone to talk to. 
I have been sleeping 2-4 hours a night at most for nearly two years. I am dreading what she might do, I am terrified, I search her stuff for pills, for recipes, for notes, for whatever. I sneak downstairs at night and search her purse. I hug her and tell her I love her all the time. I stand in her room for hours when she sleeps to listen to her breathing. I do not want to lose my mom. I do not. I love her and if she ever ended her life I would do the same because I couldn't bear it. So many things could take her from me rn and I don't know what to look for. I have never felt such anguish in my life. 
Today I saw on her emails that she ordered an urn. I know for sure it's for her. I can't talk with her, she'll just get mad and then feel even more guilty. I am also probably literally unable to, my mind won't let me. 
She has been spending a lot and buying nice stuff. It's unusual. I feel sick. 

I have never asked anyone to but please help me, and help me help her.

1hbld3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/comments/1hbld3p/question_i_have_bizarre_vidsions_while_trying_to/,"Question: I have bizarre ""vidsions"" while trying to fall asleep, is this related to remote viewing in anyway shape or form? ","When ever I am attempting to fall asleep or I rest with my eyes, I often have random images objects, or extremely complex geometric shapes or patterns that seem more real than reality it's self? If that makes sense? It's kinda like watching a next gen super HD 8K TV. Hard to explain? Last night I was randomly hit with this image of this giant purple air balloon. The shapes and colors can last several seconds and come in waves that last a couple minutes. The images of random objects are very quick, and I noticed if I try my best to focus on certain aspects or details the image will last slightly longer than usual, but not if I look directly at it? 

I understand how powerful the subconscious is. I truly get it. But I can't stress just how random these objects are. And how they play no role what's so ever in my life, interests, etc. 

I have very odd synchronicities occur weekly. Very, very random things. Again. Just today, I was thinking about how much I like the movie Inglorious bastards for the past couple days and how I should buy the movie, today I was thinking about writing a short story I have been wanting too for a long time now, and I thought about trying to learn as much as I could about Quentin Tarantino and his writing process, how he thinks etc. Sit down with a coffee, open YouTube and BAM there he is, on Joe Rogans podcast, that was uploaded 33 minutes prior to me sitting down. I can assure the classics occur. Numbers I'm thinking of pop up everywhere, people I know showing up, calling, dying, when I think of them out of nowhere, know what is going to happen at places like work, in my personal life well before it happens, etc etc. It happens so much I barely acknowledge it anymore. My girlfriend has been telling to write them down for years, but even if I did who would believe and who would care? It's such random, useless, mundane garbage.

Is any of this connected to or would benefit a beginer in anyway if they decided to start taking learning RV seriously? I have lurked here for a long time and often see people describe and explain RVing in multiple interpretations. So sorry if I'm very far off the mark in anyway.

1hblb4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hblb4g/long_distance_girlfriend_depressed_badly_how_to/,"Long distance Girlfriend depressed badly, How to help?  USA/EUROPE"," 

(Sorry for spelling in grammar this was stressful to write.) Btw this is just some random old account because she follows my main account. 

For the last year I have been outta work because of a big health issue I had last year. Taken me like a whole year to get back to a kind of normal, but even now I still have issues. But My hope is to get a new job next year and have some kind of fresh start. This year I lost three people close to me, my best friend, and 2 family members. All that and my serious illness put me into the worst depression I have had in my life. I have always been pretty lonely tbh, No friends irl friends whatsoever for years. Down the years a few online ones, but in the end tend to lose contact every time.

So losing pretty much everyone I was close with this year when I have myself been ill has been really tough. There is an online chatroom I have been on for a few years, few online regulars. Anyhow one day this new girl comes in, and tbh to begin with I kinda ignored her, I myself had depression and I dunno Sometimes it just makes me withdraw especially from new people.

Anyways we ended up talking in private messages in the end.  Somehow I find myself talking to this girl for hours upon hours each day. On some days it's basically the whole day. I live in europe she lives in the United states. I never knew I could talk to someone for so long, And enjoy someones company so much. At the time I was in a deep depression. But meeting her talking to her lifted it and made me feel a happyness i honestly never thought I would feel again. After the worse year of my life. Then one day when we are talking she mentions the fact she has not heard from her mom for too long the whole day and that she was worried. So that she was going to go check on her. This is all live so we are still chatting about all this as she goes over to her moms house to check on her. Basically long story short her mom was in an abusive relationship with her husband. Bizarrely enough his brother is in jail for killing his wife.But she goes to check on her because she is worried, she can’t get a reply when she knocks on the doors and windows.She is scared of the husband because he has made threats before and there was was indicent when he chased after her trying to hurt her. She eventually calls the police and does a welfare check on her mom, when they turn up after much trying the husband eventually answers the door and after much back and forth he does not let them seen the mom is ok,. Instead he only allows her to shout from a room in the house that she is ok, and they accept this and leave basically.

 Now I gotta lot of feelings about that whole fiasco. But lets stick to our story. Anyways a few days go by, once again me and her are uo chatting and we are joking around talking about the most trivial shit And I will never forget this at 3,59am for me, she is 5 hours earlier due to the time difference but at 3:59 she replies to a joke comment I made and then within 20 seconds she posts OMG my mom is being rushed to hospital with no pulse. Her aunt had texted her this news. I think back to this alot because in a matter of seconds her life changed forever. I mean its super late for me, but I stay on and chat to her as she drives to the hospital to try and find her mom.

But the whole thing is chaos even though she was next of kin for her mom, she has real trouble finding out the info of what hospital she is on, the husband wont answer calls. She is driving and calling around a few diff hospitals. Eventually, she finds her in in serious condition, she was tranfered to the nearest city hospital. Its bad news, she is in a coma. They want to transfer her to another hospital for specialist treatment. Over the next few day me and her talk. I listen mostly I mean, try to comfort her best I can I mean its difficult to find the words in this situation. 

 However, looking at further scans the brain specialist believed the injury to be unsurvivable. She is given a few days to say goodbye. She sends me pics of her holding her moms hand and that in the hospital room. And other pictures of what her mom looks like. Black and blue. Injuries everywhere. She passes away soon after, some of her organs are donated. A little while after all this she tells me not one person in her real life in terms of friends or family came to visit her whilst she was at the hospital.

 She types this long beautifully worded message to me saying she will never forget how I was there for her during those days. Basically, the investigation by the police falls apart, I think largely because of that bungled welfare check, and basic protocols are not followed, its a total mess really. And its probably something that happens way to often where victims are not given the justice they deserve.

After this this girl does everything she can possibly do to try and get justice for her mom. I cant even begin to explain the effort she made, she did everything within her possible powers. But the appeal process and that looks to be a dead end. She actually did a gofund me to try and raise money to help to an appeal and to raise money for funeral costs but it never really raised enough money, and fell way short.

 We continue to talk for many more months, everyday. Before I know we end up falling in love. Texting, calls and video calls everynight. For hours most the time. Somehow in the worst year of my life I found someone who made me feel happy again when honestly, I really doubted I would ever feel that. I think she would describe it somewhat in the same way. And of course I think we both needed emotional support someone to care for us because we are both lonely and sad. In a way its just a shame we are so far apart, europe and  USA. I asked her one time when she knew she liked me and she reposted that message she wrote me telling me how she would never forget how I was there for her when her mom was in hospital, more so than anyone else in IRL. 

I don’t believe in destiny fate or god, none of that. Never have. But there is a hell of a lot of strange coincidences between us my mom was an alcoholic as well. And its a cruel and dark world at times but somehow some little force of good or luck perhaps brought two people in there worse year alive together. Somehow two people found the exact right person they needed at there darkest time. 

 With my health issues she is always reminding me to take my medications which tbh I often forget at times. I developed diabetes from my other health complications this year, and she went from knowing nothing about diabetes to being an expert in how to eat healthy and all that which she of course endlessly pushes onto me. Like when she started doing that kind of stuff for me I reall started to realize how lucky I am. 

She has also made me go out more, do more things and enjoy life again. For a long time I have needed someone to encourage me. She doesn't really have any family or friends, and the one person she did have part from her mom, her aunt her moms sister, she ended up dying just a few months after her mom. I MEAN MY GOD RIGHT. 

 I feel the pressure of this insane responsibility because I am the one and only person she has. But I am thousands of miles away, I don’t have the resources to sweep in and help her. Because as I say I have been out of work from being so ill this year. I feel so lucky to have found her in my worst year, But She needs a knight in shining armor to come rescue her. And she really is the unluckiest person this year because she has been stuck with me instead. Someone who can’t help her. Part of me wishes some guy in the USA had been the one to be there for her that night. I mean atleast he could have realistically gotten over there to be with her, to hug her, and to reassure her. Boy does she need a long hug.  Very recently this appeal thing ground to a halt and it looks to be going no where, there is still this DV non profit who want to maybe try and help. Get things going again, but it does look all rather hopeless.

 Since this appeal failure, she has fallen into a deep depression. She sleeps most of the day and night.It's much harder to talk to her. She is doing something I have done when depressed before and that is shut down and cut people off. I was kinda shocked to see just how down and unhappy she looked during one of our last video calls. Of late I have been trying my best to encourage her to take her dogs for a walk, to do small things like go get a coffee. Just small things. And of course I remind her to take her medication now, she is on antidepressants. She has been doing these things and sending me pics proving she been out walking the dogs and such, but she is defo less responsive now to my suggestions. She was in therapy for a while aswell that seemed to be doing her good for a time, but ultimately, it was costing her too much money for her to afford. During our last call I was able to get her to smile and laugh a few times. Making Her laugh and smile at any time is the greatest joy I have ever felt, but that last time was especially meaningful given how down she has been. And she later thanked me for that call saying it was the only time she had laughed that entire day. That made my year, that alone. Its such a sad story because ultimately she did everything she could to try and save her mom this last year, especially,  and before that spent what little money she had to send her to rehab a few times she was an alcoholic. Her mom left him many times because she was scared to death of him but ultimately despite so much rehab, she always went back with him largely due to the drinking which she was enabled to do there.     Anyways the Girl I love The other day mentioned having suicidal thoughts. In a way I AM pleased she trusts me enough to share this. But I have not stopped worrying since. I mean I can’t lose someone else this year.

You know even if ultimately we are don’t end up together I would like to see her happy. She deserves that so much. Because she is a very kind sweet and genuine person. But the question is how can I help her?There is only so much you can do online. Its easy to shut people off, online. I have been tempted to go in person, but as I say I have limited resources given I have been ill and outta work for over a year.

So even the plane ticket would really be stretching me. Like maybe I could go for 1 or 2 days maybeee. But I would need time to save. And the worry is it might be too late by then, I can’t shake that thought. Now I know where she lives and works, But I would never just turn up unaccounted. I would turn up at the nearest city and ultimately its her choice if she wants to meet or not. I would text her my location.

I mean she has said countless times how she longs for the day when one of us gets off a plane and we can have that long waited hug. Again i can't really go over there, but at the same time I am very limited with how much I can help her just via online. Any advice on this is appreciated and I promise to thank everyone who says something I find helpful. Also my dms will be open if anyone got something else to say and tbh if anyone wants to maybe call and talk about this with any advise that would I think be a great help, that could be arranged in dms. Cause as I say I don’t really have any friends or family to talk about this with. The one person Who I do, is the one in trouble.    ALSO I PROMISE TO POST A FUTURE UPDATE, AT SOME POINT.

1hbl9uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1hbl9uy/vvs1_diamonds_key_notes_and_expert_tips_for/,VVS1 Diamonds: Key Notes and Expert Tips for Diamond Buyers,"VVS1 diamonds represent the pinnacle of commercially available clarity, with fewer than 1% of all diamonds achieving this exceptional grade. Market analysis reveals these ultra-rare stones command a 20-30% premium over VS1 grades despite being visually indistinguishable without professional magnification equipment exceeding 20x power.

This guide provides sophisticated strategies for navigating the VVS1 market, including expert methodologies for maximizing returns in this guaranteed-excellence clarity grade.

# Bottom Line:

The term VVS1 stands for “Very Very slightly Included level 1”, an exceptionally rare and high-quality grade representing less than 1% of the diamond market. Their inclusions are virtually invisible, even under 10x magnification. While offering superior clarity, they come at a premium price point that may only be justified for some buyers. For lab-grown diamond buyers, there is no reason to compromise over clarity - you can get a VVS lab diamond for an affordable price. For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

Feel free to[ reach out for a free one-on-one consultation.](https://labdiamondsreview.com/contact-us/)

# Who is this for?

* Collectors and connoisseurs seeking top-tier diamond quality
* Buyers with a generous budget who prioritize rarity and prestige
* Those desiring a virtually flawless diamond for special occasions or investments

# Who is this not for?

* Budget-conscious shoppers
* Those who prioritize size over clarity
* Buyers satisfied with eye-clean diamonds of lower clarity grades

# Recommendations for smart buying:

1. Compare with lower clarity grades: VS1 or SI1 diamonds can often appear identical to the naked eye at a lower cost when picked right.  
2. Focus on cut quality: A well-cut diamond with slightly lower clarity can often outshine a poorly cut VVS1.  
3. Consider shape: Step-cut diamonds (emerald, asscher) may benefit more from high clarity than brilliant cuts.  

1. Shop online: Reputable online retailers often offer better prices than brick-and-mortar stores.  
2. Verify certification: Ensure the diamond is certified by a respected lab like GIA or AGS.  

# FAQ:

Q: What does VVS1 mean?A: VVS1 stands for ""Very Very Slightly Included 1,"" indicating minimal inclusions visible only to skilled graders under magnification.

Q: How much more expensive are VVS1 diamonds compared to lower grades?A: VVS1 diamonds can be 10-30% more expensive than VS1 diamonds, depending on other factors like carat weight and color.

Q: Are VVS1 diamonds a good investment?A: While they hold value due to rarity, diamonds generally aren't considered ideal investments. Purchase for personal enjoyment rather than financial gain.

Q: Can I see the difference between a VVS1 and a VS1 diamond without magnification?A: No, both grades appear flawless to the naked eye. The difference is only visible under professional magnification.

Q: Do lab-grown VVS1 diamonds exist?A: Yes, lab-grown diamonds can achieve VVS1 clarity at a lower cost than natural diamonds of the same grade.

Remember, while VVS1 diamonds are exceptional, the best diamond for you depends on your personal preferences, budget, and priorities.
