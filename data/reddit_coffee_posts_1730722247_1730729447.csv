1gjf156,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Loud-Astronaut299/comments/1gjf156/the_power_of_contentment_finding_happiness_from/,"The Power of Contentment: Finding Happiness from Within
","In today's fast-paced world, we often find ourselves relentlessly pursuing happiness. We chase after the latest fashion trends, gadgets, and the most prominent houses, believing that these material possessions will fill the emptiness we sometimes feel. However, true happiness is not found in what we own but in how we view our lives and appreciate what we have. Happiness is more dependent on our outlook and perceptions than our clothing. Embracing the idea of contentment can lead us to discover peace and joy in every aspect of our lives.

Contentment is the key to experiencing fulfillment. It teaches us to appreciate the small, everyday moments that often go unnoticed. For instance, instead of waking up and immediately feeling the urge to check social media for updates on the latest trends, we can take a moment to enjoy the sunlight streaming through the window, the sound of birds chirping outside, or the comfort of a warm cup of coffee in our hands. These simple pleasures can bring joy that material possessions cannot match.

In our consumer-driven society, it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that we need more to be happy. Advertisements constantly bombard us with messages suggesting we should buy, achieve, and be more. Yet, when we shift our focus away from comparing ourselves to others and instead look inward, we realize that true happiness comes from being satisfied with who we are and what we already have. It’s a powerful realization that can transform our lives, leading us to fill our days with gratitude rather than envy.

Consider the example of someone who practices contentment. Instead of splurging on the trendiest clothes or the latest electronic gadgets, this person finds joy in the company of family and friends. They might take leisurely walks in the park or cultivate hobbies like painting or gardening. These activities bring them genuine happiness and help them appreciate the present moment—a skill many of us need to develop. By engaging in these fulfilling activities, we can create our joy bubbles, free from the external pressures of society.

Moreover, being content allows us to develop more profound gratitude. When we start acknowledging the blessings in our lives, no matter how small they seem, we can uncover a hidden reservoir of happiness. Practicing gratitude can become a daily habit. We can keep a gratitude journal and write down three things we appreciate daily—the taste of our favorite food, a compliment from a friend, or even a cozy evening at home. Each entry is a little reminder of the joys already filling our lives.

In conclusion, cultivating contentment is essential in a world that pushes us towards constant comparison and desire for more. Happiness is not just a destination to reach; it's a way of living. We can unlock true happiness by appreciating what we have, focusing on our inner satisfaction, and practicing gratitude. So, I challenge each of you to take a moment each day to reflect on the simple pleasures in your life. Embrace contentment, and you may find that lasting joy within your grasp, waiting to be discovered.

My current plan is to add the coffee and cocoa nibs to a hop bag and toss it in a corny keg. Purge the keg of oxygen and transfer my beer in there for 5 or so days. One of my big questions is about sterilizing the bag/coffee/nibs. A lot of people suggest soaking in vodka or bourbon before adding to the keg.

Like mentioned in my previous post, here is the details of the coffee, Robin and Video edit....

I started my day at Starbucks around 7:30 a.m., ready to challenge myself with a new habit—reading at least 10 pages of a book. As a trial, I had started with another book (an amazing one, details in another post!). But today, I was diving into a new read.

I ordered my usual: **medium roast, medium coffee with 2 honey and a little bit of steamed whole milk**. ☕ The comforting familiarity of this ritual always brings me a sense of warmth. One of the best parts is how the baristas recognize me the moment I walk in.  
Even in an AI-driven world, these small human connections mean so much. 😊 They start prepping my coffee without a word, making me feel seen and valued. It’s those simple moments that remind me just how special human interactions can be. **Hats off to Starbucks for that sense of connection!**

With my coffee in hand, I found my usual spot, set down my bag, and opened my book, ready to read. Just as I was getting into it, my phone rang—it was my childhood friend. We hadn’t talked in a while, and he called to check in. We had a great conversation that felt like no time had passed. True childhood friends are always there, no matter how far apart you are. 😊

After the call, I got back to reading. Just then, two gentlemen who looked like they’d just finished a workout came in to grab their coffee. One noticed my book and started a conversation. He asked what I was reading, so I shared: **""Everyday Hero"" by Robin Sharma** ([check it out here](https://a.co/d/c4BbYOn)). He read the back cover and said he’d add it to his list. It was a brief, friendly chat that added a nice touch to my morning.

Here’s the truth: I’ve never been much of a book reader. 📚 My mind always struggles to stay focused, jumping from one thought to another—*Is my car okay? Why do my eyes feel dry? What other work do I need to finish?* It’s like a storm of thoughts. Memories of unfinished tasks and chaotic days rushed back, reminding me of how often I start 10 things and finish none. It’s overwhelming and frustrating.

But today, I pushed through. I stayed present and read. It was tough, but I managed 20 pages. It felt good—a small victory—but also an eye-opener to how much I need to work on my focus. We’re so used to multitasking that focusing on one thing feels almost impossible. Let’s see where this journey goes. (I’ll keep you posted! 😅) 

After reading, I took a quick break to call my parents. Just hearing their voices gave me a moment to reset and feel grounded. ❤️

**Challenge two:** I decided to finish a video edit for a recent office potluck. I had raw footage and spent the next 2-4 hours immersed in editing. The sense of satisfaction when I completed it was real, and the result turned out great!

# Lessons from Today’s Journey

* **Human connections matter.** Being recognized at Starbucks and having my coffee made without asking reminds me that kindness and connection are still out there. Appreciate them.
* **Talking to strangers can be uplifting.** The chat with the gentleman about my book showed me how curious and kind people can be. Little conversations brighten your day.
* **Starting and finishing.** I tend to procrastinate and leave things half-done, juggling a thousand thoughts. Today, focusing on reading and video editing felt different—grounding and fulfilling. Let’s see if I can keep this up! 😊

Oh, and one last thing! I ran into an old train buddy who I hadn’t seen in ages. She shared that she recently had a baby girl. We chatted and caught up, which made the day even better. 🍼😊

**Coworker asked me to be her man of honor. I said no and she went nuts. What did I miss?**

&#x200B;

This happen yesterday and I'm still confused.

Yesterday was my first day back to work after being off for two weeks. This is kinda important. One of my coworkers had gotten engaged the week before I left. When she announced at work we all did the congratulations and happy for her type of things. I thought it was over. So when I left for vacation the last I knew no plans had yet been made. Then yesterday when I went back to work my boss K and best friend L said that coworker C was looking for me. I asked what was up and they weren't sure but she was carrying a little gift bag.

A few minutes later C found me and asked how my vacation was. I was telling them about it and she cut me off and said she had a very important question to ask. She handed a little gift bag and asked if I would be her best man of honor for her wedding. I thanked her and told her that typically this would traditionally go to a close female relationship. She responded that there was nothing traditional about her wedding so it was good. I looked over at L and K who were both trying to keep from laughing. I again thanked her congratulated her and told her that I wasn't interested in being part of her wedding party and that I would be happier being a guest in the audience.

I swear when I said this it was when we watched her entire demeanor changed and a switch flipped. She went off saying that I have to be in her wedding and that she doesn't understand why I would say no. I told her that we only knew each other for a short time and that I had no interest in trying to plan parties, dinners, and shopping trips. She told me I needed to think about it and she would get back to me later. I told her go for it but my answer will be the same.

She walked away and I looked at K and L and asked what the ever loving fresh creepy hell was that??? K started to laugh and said she didn't know. But saying no like I did might have saved me a lot of headaches in the future. L made the comment that she went straight to bridezilla and this was a look into what she was going to be like.

C came back today however she went with a different approach and handed me a list of what she wants me to do and her vision of how she sees things. I asked her why she gave me this and she said that as her man of honor these were my responsibilities. I told her again that I was not going to do any of this. She started again that she needs me to do this and ""How much fun it was going to be."" Then she asked ""Haven't you ever wanted to be part of something special?"" I told her I was. I was a nurse. Enter K who could sense that I needed help and told C one of her patients needed her help. I told K that if this keeps up I might need her help. She said she was already watching it and and would intervene if I needed it.

What did I miss??? We aren't that close. She just transferred down to my unit from a different unit six months ago. I had no idea who she was until that point. L is saying that she is close in age to me and she might feel that to be enough of a connection. Did I miss something??? When we are asked are we supposed to automatically gush and jump up and down in excitement? Why is saying No a bad thing?

*It sounds like she has no one else in her life and you being around her age and nice to her was enough to give you the “honor.” Stay firm and don’t give in.*

*Also from your post history I assume (correct me if I’m wrong) you’re a gay man? Could she be putting a lot of weird stereotypes into play and trying to make you her “gay best friend” & wedding planner?*

*This was exactly what my mind went to. She wants to be cool by having a gay ""best friend"".*

**Update - 1 day later**

Hey everyone.

First I apologize.  I never thought this was going to go as crazy as it did.  I want all of you to know I read all of your responses and responded to as many as I was able to.  Thank you all for your amazing insights and comments.  Many that made me laugh.  Which I needed.  I have been sick and that really helped to cheer me up.

I had to meet with my lawyer today regarding family issues.  My neighbor/best friend/coworker L took me.  I really felt awful and driving wasn’t a good idea.  We were talking about this on the way and we both were asking a lot of the same questions that all you were asking. The big one was that we were asking about the circumstances of her transfer.  She went from Med Surge 4W to the ER.  That is a huge change.  I have to work tomorrow so we will see what happens.  But L and I are going to ask K about the transfer and raise a couple of other concerns. After I got home from the meeting with my lawyer I slept for the rest of the day.

Many of you asked about if C and I hang out outside of work.  The answer is no.  I really don’t know anything about her.  I have helped her a few times with patients and different things.  But our relationship is 100% purely work related. That was why I was so surprised that she asked me to do this. That is why I was so surprised that she asked me about being the Man of Honor. I have a very small friend base and in all honesty I like to keep it that way.

I really have no interest in being a part of this.  I’m not a wedding person.  After reading so many Bridezilla stories and hearing about over the top weddings they have become a huge turn off to me spending tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars with insane unrealistic demands that turn people against each other.   Why???? I would rather use that money and spend that time planning my next trip or vacation.

Many people said that I was being used as a token or prop in a wedding. Or a gay Best Friend.  I never really thought about it.  I admit that I’m out and proud. But I’m not going to just pretend to be someone friend just so they can fulfill some kind of fetish they have for wanting to have a gay best friend or some kind of status she feels the need to fulfill.  It takes me a lot to get offended but if this were actually the case then I would really be rather offended.  I was not put on the face of the Earth to be someones play toy.

A lot of people have said that maybe she doesn’t have a boyfriend.  She does. She has brought him in before.  If she has any insecurity I don’t understand it.  She is attractive, smart and knows he stuff.  So I’m at a loss as to why she is acting like this.

A lot of people say go to HR.  I’m starting that process with my boss K. She is completely aware of the situation being with us when all this happen.  She has told me that she is watching the situation and will jump in if I need her to. I trust her completely.  While K and HR can control the situation from the hospital they can’t control the situation from a personal level if she were to maybe follow me home or a situation like that.

So I think that covers it all. I wish I could say this is over.  But most likely there is more to come.  Set your update me.

*I really hope you can figure out what she thinks she's trying to do and escape the situation unscathed. From the way you said she acted, this may be a thing where one of you has to leave the department you work for. I hope it doesn't come to that.*

*I don't blame you for not wanting to be around people and their wedding BS. I feel the same way. And it seems like, in America at least, people are getting worse and worse.*

*Best of luck to you, and I can't wait to see your next update.*

&#x200B;

**Silent\_Coffee\_7292**

*I wonder if all her friends said no. Or if she doesn't have as many as she's says.*

*Or*

*Her fiance has a best woman and she feels threatened by that.*

**Update - 2 days later**

&#x200B;

I keep forgetting to thank my boyfriend. He has been with me on this but more in the background. First when we were laughing about it. But when everything Thursday happen he was there as well. L was able to get him away from his unit for a little bit for the it will be okay boyfriend hug. He stayed the night with me a couple of nights as well also helping with me being sick. So yeah. I'm very lucky to have such a great support.

This intro is going to be long, but I’m telling you about this for a reason and later in this update it will make sense.  I'm hoping this will be done and that this will be the last of this whole situation.

I was born into a family where I was referred to as “An issue that needed to be dealt with” I lived in the shadows of my sister who was the child my parents wanted.  They wanted one child which was a girl.  That way Dad had his daddy girl and mom had mommy little princess.  Then I came along.  Keep in mind that I’m 23 so back then my parents had options but chose to not use any of those options.  So instead my parents raised my sister and I was raised by a nanny who even to this day is one of the biggest influences in my life and I am so grateful for her.  She helped me with so much. I finally realized that all these years later that by being referred to as “An issue that needed to be dealt with” that they stripped me of my humanity and individuality and self- worth as a person.  I think that’s why I have worked so hard to establish myself in my career and in my life.  As a way to become a person again and not just be that issue that needed to be dealt with.

This past Thursday things came to a head with the Bridezilla known as C and the truth came out.  My best friend L has been sticking close to me when we work together if C was to start something.  We weren’t sure if she was going to leave it alone or start up again.  I was really hoping that it was done.  But she had to try once again. I’ve been sick and I had a busy morning so I really just wanted a few minutes to go to the bathroom, grab a quick snack and maybe breath??? C came up and had her list and asked if I had a few minutes to talk about the wedding planning.  I looked at her and told her again no that I was not interested in being part of her wedding and that I was not going to help in anyway and she needed to drop the subject and leave me alone.  Again she went into the who thing of how I was going to do this and how much fun it was going to be.  Here we go with that line all of you loved the first time.  “Why in the ever loving fresh creepy hell is it so important for me to be your Man of Honor? I’m not interested and I’m not doing it.”

It is as exactly as pretty much all of you told me it would be.  She was just planning on using me as a token or a play toy.  She took all of the fucked up gay stereo types that are out in society and put them into one sentence. “What modern liberal women isn’t going to have a Gay Bestie on her arm for special events?”

I felt everything in my stomach move and a wave of nausea come over me and I felt like I couldn’t get to the bathroom fast enough. This pissed L off to no end.  L is really kinda like the over protective sister that I wish I would have had and took C off to visit our boss K and laid it all out.  Everything that was said. While I wasn’t in on that conversation L and K filled me in on what was said.  K came to check on me and I was still hiding in the bathroom She knocked on the door and asked if she could come in.  I asked her for a bottle of water first.

While I was waiting I realized two things.  I realized why I chose to not hang out with her and why didn’t like her.  I couldn’t figure out why I didn’t like her just that there was something that gave me the heebeegeebees. But I realized that I didn’t like her because she is a different version of my sister. While C is educated and employed she doesn’t care about other people and their feelings.  She is like my sister in the sense that if she wants something bad enough she will figure out how to get it.  The second thing I realized was that she did exactly what my parents did to me.  She completely dehumanized me and reduced me to an entity.  Just kinda turned me into a token or a thing for her.  I think the word that best describes it is I’m must a play toy. What really gets me is that just like my sister C doesn’t think she did anything wrong and I’m being too sensitive and a delicate snowflake.

The next day an emergency meeting was held at work and C is being suspended pending investigation and a new transfer is being looked into. K made the request for her to be terminated. The Director of Emergency Nursing said this was a last resort but she was going to be looking into options which could be sending her to a new hospital or facility. This didn't go over well with me. I asked what would happen if she did the exact same thing to someone different? She didn't really give me an answer. But she said she still needs to look into a few things and at this point she is suspended.

Anyway. Here it is. I'm still pretty sick and had to work this weekend. If I can I'll respond. I want to thank everyone for all the amazing support. I am going back to my lawyer to see if he can figure out how to send her a Cease and Desist letter to make sure she doesn't contact me. I'm heading to bed. Have a good night!!!

1gjey25,https://www.reddit.com/r/PTLawSchool/comments/1gjey25/networking_as_a_parttime_law_student_and_parent/,Networking as a Part-Time Law Student and Parent: Making Connections That Count,"Hi All - Continuing my blog series to help share some of my experiences going to law school. Hope you all find this helpful.

Balancing law school as a part-time student is already a major feat. Add parenting into the mix, and you’re navigating a tightrope of responsibilities. Between classes, work, and caring for your kids, it might seem like there's little room for networking, but it’s critical for your future career in law. The good news is, with a little strategy and time management, you can build meaningful professional relationships that will open doors without overwhelming your already packed schedule.

Here’s how to make networking work for you as a part-time law student and parent:

# 1. Prioritize Quality Over Quantity

Time is your most limited resource. Unlike full-time students, you don’t have the luxury to attend every networking event or mixer. That’s why it's important to focus on making a few deep connections rather than spreading yourself too thin. Look for opportunities that fit your schedule and align with your career goals. For example, virtual networking events, webinars, or even coffee chats with professionals can be less time-consuming and just as effective.

# 2. Leverage Your Existing Network

You probably have more connections than you realize. Your current job, previous career, or even your children’s school community might have professionals in the legal field or people with valuable connections. Parents in similar situations might have insights on balancing law school and family life, and they can also be key professional allies.

Start by reaching out to those already within your circle. Professors, classmates, and even law school alumni are valuable resources who can offer advice and connections in the legal field. Sometimes the best opportunities come from unexpected places, so don’t be afraid to let people know you’re pursuing law school while managing family life.

# 3. Use Family Time to Your Advantage

Attending networking events while parenting might seem impossible, but sometimes, you can use your family obligations to network. For example, events at your kids’ school, sports games, or community functions are great places to meet professionals in different industries. These informal settings can lead to more organic conversations and connections.

You can also use family-friendly networking events, if available, through your law school or community. If your law school hosts family days or casual alumni gatherings, take advantage of these opportunities to build connections in an environment that accommodates your family needs.

# 4. Join Law School Organizations—Strategically

Even as a part-time student with limited availability, joining law-related student organizations can be incredibly beneficial. Look for ones that offer flexibility, such as online discussions, evening meetings, or events that don’t interfere with your parenting schedule. Organizations like the law review, student bar association, or practice groups related to your interest area can connect you with students and professionals in a more focused setting.

If physically attending meetings is a challenge, ask if they offer virtual options or recordings. Many groups have adapted to hybrid models, making it easier to participate even with a busy schedule.

# 5. Engage in Virtual Networking

Virtual networking has become a key tool for part-time students and parents alike. You don’t have to physically attend an event to make valuable connections. LinkedIn is a powerful platform to engage with professionals, follow law-related discussions, and even message attorneys or alumni for informational interviews.

Webinars and online legal forums are also excellent ways to stay informed and connected without leaving home. You can participate during downtime or after your kids are asleep, allowing you to balance professional development with parenting.

# 6. Network Within Your Job

If you’re working part-time or full-time while attending law school, your job is an immediate source of potential connections. Even if your current role isn't law-related, the professionals you interact with may have connections in the legal industry or may themselves need legal advice. Don’t overlook colleagues and supervisors as valuable contacts—they can offer recommendations, introductions, or insight into navigating professional life as a parent.

# 7. Seek Out Mentorship Opportunities

A mentor can be a game-changer for your career, offering guidance and support as you balance school, work, and family. Look for lawyers or professionals who have been in your shoes—whether that’s being a parent while studying or someone who transitioned into law later in life. Your unique situation can be an asset in connecting with mentors who understand your challenges.

Many law schools and bar associations have mentorship programs. Don’t hesitate to reach out to potential mentors via LinkedIn or through alumni networks, explaining your journey and how you hope to learn from their experience.

# 8. Be Selective with In-Person Events

While virtual networking is a lifesaver, some in-person events are worth the time and effort. Legal conferences, workshops, and local bar association meetings can offer high-value interactions that aren’t always possible online. If you decide to attend an in-person event, choose one that aligns closely with your career interests and offers a solid return on investment.

Pro tip: See if the event offers childcare services or activities that accommodate parents. Some professional organizations recognize the challenges of working parents and offer family-friendly solutions.

# 9. Balance Networking with Your Schedule

The key to networking as a parent and part-time student is balance. You don’t need to attend every event or meet with every contact immediately. Instead, prioritize your time based on what will give you the most value. Consider dedicating a specific time each week for networking activities—whether that’s attending one event per month, setting up a lunch meeting, or reaching out to a new contact online.

Be sure to communicate your availability clearly when scheduling any networking commitments, explaining that you’re balancing law school and family obligations. Many professionals will admire your dedication and be understanding of your situation.

# 10. Follow Up and Stay Connected

Building connections is only the first step—maintaining them is equally important. After meeting someone new, whether online or in person, take the time to send a thoughtful follow-up email or LinkedIn message. Briefly remind them of who you are, what you discussed, and express your appreciation for their time.

Keeping the relationship alive doesn’t require constant communication—periodic check-ins, sharing relevant articles, or congratulating them on their achievements are simple ways to maintain your connection without taking too much time from your busy schedule.

# Final Thoughts

As a part-time law student and parent, you have unique demands on your time, but you also bring a valuable perspective to the table. Networking is about building relationships that will support your career, and it doesn’t have to be a daunting task. With the right approach, you can create lasting professional connections that will help you succeed in law while balancing your most important role as a parent.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

Even more than school life. This time, his eyes had no sparkle. I could see nothing other than darkness in his eyes. He had wore a black suit with a formal white shirt. 

   He walked inside and sat in front of me. I was too stunned to see him. Another woman came with him holding his hand. My client said to Josh, “This is Lydia which I was talking about. She made all the clothes that you wanted.” 

   Josh looked at me. The woman beside him said, “Really, I loved your designs very much.” I said, “Thank you.” She said, “I forgot to introduce myself. I am Alice Lockwood.” 

   She was the owner of Lockwood company. She had dark black hair, siren eyes. Her hair was wavy. She was wearing a white shirt along with a black blazer. She had wear high black heels. 

  I said, “Nice to meet you. What designer clothes should I make?” Alice said, “Well I want fashionable clothes. Made something which is in trend.” “Sure. Anything else.” I said, smiling at her. 

  Alice said, “Yes. I need a wedding dress too.” “He is my fiance.” Alice said, holding her hands with Josh. Josh smiled towards her. “Maybe we should go now. I have a meeting soon.” Josh said, looking towards his watch. 

    Alice and Josh left the office. It was unbelievable. Josh is going to marry Alice. He moved on so easily. Of course, eight years had passed. I was very sad. I went to meet my friends. 

   

   I reached Blue Bottle Coffee. I entered inside and waved at my friends who were waiting for me. “You are late again.” said Clara. “Just inform us if you will be late.” said Becca. 

   Clara and Becca were twenty-five years old living together. Becca and Clara were twin sisters. They both looked very similar. Blonde hair and doe eyes. The only difference was Becca had blue eyes whereas Clara had black eyes. 

   “Sorry guys. This will be the last time, I swear.” I said. “So anything new with anyone.” Clara said. I said, “Guess who I met today.” “Who?” Clara exclaimed. I said, “The owner of Lockwood company, Alice Loodwood.” 

   Becca and Clara were stunned and started to look at each other. “Really. Lucky you.” said Clara. “She wants me to design some clothes for her.” I said taking a sip of my cappuccino which Clara had ordered for me. 

   Becca said, “She is so famous. Her cosmetics company is so good. Her products are my everyday use. She looks so beautiful.” 

   I said, “This is true. I am so excited to work for her.” Then we started to talk about our work. We talked for some hours and then I left. It was really late. 

I was walking on the street on my way to my apartment. It was dark outside. The lights were blinking. I was thinking about the designs when I saw a shadow. Someone was behind me. 

   I was walking fast. The person was following me. I was scared. There was no one nearby. I was all alone in the street. All of a sudden, I tripped down. The person came towards me, offering a hand to pull me up. 

   I stood up on my way. I was going to walk away. Unexpectedly, he showed me a knife and said, “Give me all of your money right now.” It was terrifying. I pulled out a pepper spray out of my bag and used it. He couldn't see me as he was rubbing his eyes. I took the chance and ran away. 

  I hurt my leg. I was running as fast as I could. I saw a car coming. I shouted, “Please help me.” going in front of the car. The car stopped. 

   It was Josh. He came outside. I didn't say anything. I was quiet. He saw the man behind me in black clothes. He went towards him. The man said, “Give me your money.” showing him a knife.

   Josh took the knife and threw it away. He punched the man very hard on his face. The man was bleeding. “Don't ever come near us again. Or else you will die. Understood.” Josh said, putting his hand on his collar. 

   The man nodded. He got scared and ran away. It wasn't the same Josh I knew. He changed. The Josh I knew never fought with anyone. He came towards me. 

   He said, “Sit on the backside.” I was confused. “I can go by myself.” I said looking at him. Josh said, “It is very late. I don't think you should be outside. I will drop you.” 

   “I can really go by myself.” I said. “I will not repeat myself. Sit quickly.” He demanded. I took a seat in his car. He started the car and took me to a store. 

   He stopped the car and went inside the store. A few minutes later he came outside with a first aid kit. He sat beside me. He pulled out an antiseptic and used it on my hand. 

  It was bleeding. I didn't notice that my hand was bleeding. He dressed my wound and said, “Take care of yourself.” Then he started the car again. He asked, “Tell me where your apartment is.” 

    I told him the address and he dropped me there. I thanked him and went straight inside my apartment. He left. 

 “I need to move on. I can't think about him now. He had moved on with his life. He was already engaged. He was going to marry Alice Lockwood.” I kept saying it to myself.

1gjes1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gjes1s/reaching_out_to_my_ex/,Reaching out to my ex,"Yes. I know you’re going to tell me DON’T DO IT, but it’s too late, I WILL do it. The breakup was because of an impulsive fight and he decided to break up. Our relationship was deteriorating because of external reasons for the past 6 months (we dated a year and half) but those were things that could have been fixed. After taking 2 months of no contact in initiated by me, and 2 months of weekly therapy, I (and my therapists agree) that there were more pros than cons, and due the fact that the breakup was impulsive and my ex is stubborn as a cow, the best course of action would be me reaching out. 

——

Now that’s out of the way, I need help deciding how to make it happen, this is what I have so far: 

What are my intentions for reaching out? 

- I want to make amends, let him know that I recognize the things I did wrong and let him know I’m working on it. I want to make sure he understands that I’m taking accountability. The reason for this is to “‘make it right” for him. If I can take away part of his pain, this is worth it. 

- When we were breaking up he said he loved me and that he wanted to be friends. I’ll ask him if the friends offering is still on the table. If he says yes, I’ll ask him what type of friends he would like to be, friends with strong boundaries (never go back together) or friends with soft boundaries (let time dictate if we go back together and start something new, but slowly, naturally). 

- Ultimately, if he says that he doesn’t want to talk to me again, I will fully respect that and move on. 



The plan (THIS IS WHAT I NEED YOUR HELP WITH)
(I want to increase my chances of success since what I personally want is to start a new relationship with him in the future)


I will text him next Monday, giving myself this whole week to prepare myself mentally to get rejected just in case that’s the outcome, accept it gracefully and move on, I will respect his decision and his boundaries. 

1. What time would be best to text him in your opinion? He works 9-5. Should I text before or after his shift? 

2. What can I say in my text? I don’t want to send a huge paragraph, but something that will spark conversation. 

3. My goal is to ask him to meet with me someday next week (in person). And we talked about going for coffee when we broke up. Is having dinner instead too invasive? What about doing a fun activity? 

4. I will lay all the cards in the table and I’ll let him chose the outcome, even if it’s “let’s not see each other again” but, he he wants “friends with soft boundaries” how can I increase my chances of getting him back? (And how to avoid a FWB situation :/) 

Any other suggestions? PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Reddit I know this is a sensitive topic for a lot of people, this is taking a lot of courage from me to carry it through, ultimately is for his good and mine as well, please don’t roast me on this. I really need kindness and actual true kind advice 

Thanks!!

1. People (and dev) need to be able to eat. Don't forget that one of those dev was supposed to work in KSP2
2. The mods already exist and the volumetric/continued version are deep rework of the mods that will come out later
3. You don't HAVE TO pay for any mods you like, you can just think of those rework as closed beta
4. The new mods for improved re-entry effect is in closed beta but the dev has also a patreon (without early-access) so that they can get financial support, just imagine that the two other are like that
5. Parallax continued git repository is public with the full project, if you don't want to wait, you can check it out and compile the mods
6. I'm pretty sure I saw the branch for the volumetric cloud on the public repo for EVE so you can also try to compile the mod yourself
7. If those dev stop developing those rework, either they do made it public and people will just grab the last existing release and will be able to regenerate the source (C# is kinda easy to get the source from the DLL, like Java from the JAR/CLASS files)
8. If you want to try it but don't want to pay a lot, you can just pay one time and get the current version...
9. On other games, paying for a dev preview isn't that uncommon and some games also have paid mods from professionals

It’s happening in the awkward, fluorescent-lit purgatory of parent-teacher conferences.

Picture this: It’s the last conference of the day, and a parent comes in hot, determined to debate their kid’s D+ in Geometry like it’s the main event of the century. You pull out the test scores, the missed homework assignments, the *fourteen* times their kid asked if they could “just vibe in the hallway” instead of taking notes, but the parent is not impressed. “My child would *never* be distracted!” they insist, as their kid is literally in the corner using their phone to learn a TikTok dance.

Meanwhile, your caffeine crash is so severe that you’re pretty sure you could see into another dimension if you closed your eyes long enough. But you soldier on, trying to explain to this parent why Geometry is indeed important, even if their kid insists, “I’m gonna be a YouTube influencer; I don’t need math!” (The same kid who, by the way, didn’t realize YouTube creators have to pay taxes.)

And let’s not forget the parents who go full conspiracy theorist, suspecting that the entire grading system is rigged. Honestly, it feels like the only thing we’re missing is a tinfoil hat for the teacher’s lounge.

Election week may be unpredictable, but one thing’s for sure: parent-teacher conferences will always test your diplomacy skills more than any presidential debate. Stay strong out there, colleagues.

I am currently doing my bachelors in a college and am a very close with one of my classmates more like an unofficial best friends, lets call her Pink. To let you know, how we became so close. So I used to date her frd (lets call her rose) for a short term and pink was too in a relationship with other guy. I later backed away from my now ex once I found out she has been seeing other guy ( we still sorta frds). While I was with rose, pink and we two used to go out, have fun and stuff so I used to have small talks with pink but once I shared to her about rose, she helped me go through it. I somehow slowly became close to her and after few weeks of the break up, pink found out her boyfriend cheated with her aswell and I helped her with it and then we grew very close. After that we used to do allot of activities together like in dates( going out, day trips, lego date, I even drank my first slip of alcohol with her).  She was however still talking with her ex whi h bothered me aswell. Tbh she was ignoring all the red flags and still going with it. She used share about the chat with me aswell but she suddenly stopped and always ignores if talks about it comes up. Ik she still talks but tries to hide from me for unknown reasons.

So till now I had no intentions of a relationship with her. After this, I hooked up with a girl I met for few times which I used to share with pink aswell. She used to be furious and I felt a bit jealous aswell but I thought that's just how anyone's supposed to react. After seeing her such behaviour I stopped with the other girl and went on with my single life. Then college started and I was thr only friends she was open with at college so she used to always be around me. And when she was waiting for me at the stations she uses to grab me coffee. And allot of signs from her that shows caring intentions which is quite new to me from her. This has sparked an imaginary relationship with her in me which is quite distracting and also has made me jealous whenever she is talking with someone who I don't prefer with or with her ex.

 Now I am in a dilemma if she's just having me or want me. I don't wanna break our frds. She sometimes shows she's into me, sometimes takes me for granted.

This woman at family mart literally shouted at me for daring to ask for syrup in my coffee. She shouted at me in Chinese in front of some other customers and I was so embarrassed and I had no idea what she was saying.

On Friday I made a post detailing how I felt Taiwan wasn’t what a lot of people on this sub make it out to be and now I want to give a follow up with some further points for the benefit of people in the rest of the world who may be considering Taiwan as a place to live.

Let’s start with the “Taiwanese are so friendly” nonsense

Since coming here I’ve had to deal with so many hostile people, with several Interactions a week like the one I mentioned that happened to me today. Everyone looks at you like you’re an alien. Parents pull their children away from you. You walk into a restaurant and the staff try to ignore you. In my condo people are so unfriendly they will wait for another lift rather than getting into the same lift as someone else. My hotel I stayed at when I first got here, the staff tried to get everyone using a self-check in because they didn’t want to have to interact with anyone. Service staff would rather blame you than accepting their mistakes. The whole culture feels incredible rude and hostile.

I would advise anyone coming here to not expect to make a single Taiwanese friend, they don’t want to be friends. They don’t even get on well with each other, if you str and look at the people walking on the road or in a ma they will all have grumpy hostile face expressions. Groups of people walk together but they don’t talk or laugh with each other, they would rather just walk silently. Same in a restaurant, restaurants are often very quiet because nobody is talking to each other, they all just eat and look at their phones.

I would also advise anyone coming here that any potentially friendly interaction you have with a Taiwanese will be immensely fake and they will be hoping you leave them and go away as soon as possible or give them something (money).

I don’t mind this since I’m only here temporarily and I came with some other foreign friends but it would be very tough if you’re planning to move here long term.

Some other things which I really hate about Taiwan that never gets mentioned on this sub.

1. The public toilets. This supposedly developed modern country still has disgusting squat toilets all over the place. No modern country has these. Most supposedly poorer countries in south east Asia now have sit down toilets with bum gun as standard, Japan and Korea have bidet toilets as standard. Taiwan is terribly far behind with this.

2. Together with the squat toilets you will see bins full of disgusting soiled toilet paper. This is totally unnecessary and disgusting. I’ve never seen this anywhere else and it makes me hate Taiwan everytime I see it.

3. The weather here is consistently awful. Summer is so unbearably hot you can’t even go outside at night without sweating (this is different to SE Asia where temperature cools down significantly at night). Mos days are horribly grey, rainy and overcast. I’ve counted 18 rainy days in a row since I came here as well as 2 typhoons. You’ll be forced to spend a lot of time indoors if you come to Taiwan.

4. The night markets. I can’t believe these are actual tourist attractions. They are hot, crowded and dirty with nowhere to sit. Go to Thailand if you want night markets. In Thailand every stand has ample seats and tables around it to sit and eat. As well as lots of clothes and accessory shops thrown in and concert stages for live bands to perform on (it’s really fun). You certainly won’t get that in Taiwan.

5. The garbage collection. Fortunately I don’t have to deal with this nonsense where I live. But the whole garbage collection situation is so ridiculous and unnecessary. The fact anyone can describe Taiwan as a convenient country when they have this system blows my mind.

6. Things take ages to repair when broken. One of The elevators broke in my building and wasn’t repaired for about two weeks, everywhere else I’ve lived this would be fixed in a day or 2 max. Not to mention the fact places are constantly turning off the elevators “to save electricity” forcing everyone to wait longer.

7. Constant sewage smell everywhere. When you’re walking just outside 101 mall you don’t expect to be breathing in sewage. Enough said.

8. Terrible tourist infrastructure. It’s embarrassing when people come to visit me and I have to recommend such a bad selection of hotels for them to stay at. Not to mention the fact all the beaches here are totally undeveloped with no beach resorts, beach clubs etc like other countries. A lot of beaches here are covered in garbage.

9. Bad breath everywhere. I’ve never come across so many otherwise perfectly respectable people who otherwise have terrible breath as in Taiwan. Especially in the morning. It is so disgusting and I don’t know why it’s so bad here. 


I'm posting this to give some balance to this incredibly delusion sub. We had someone yesterday asking something about the paper towels in restaurants and phrasing their question ""I love taiwan but ......?, I love Taiwan so much"" like seriously just ask your question. Pretty much every other country sub that I'm on people can just ask their questions and make comments about a place without all this weird profession of love that we see here.

He posted some of our screenshots on here and downplayed the context – everybody called me manipulative even though I worked with a therapist to communicate because I knew it was a sensitive subject. He started to say some awful things like how he could never see having children with me despite me likely being infertile due to health issues (which he knew and was previously supportive of) and how he wishes we never got together in the first place. On the Reddit post, he left out SO much information and of course, the messages without context look bizarre since they are about wanting to keep Life360 active as he suggested to rebuild trust. Plus, he lied about my mental health diagnoses – I don’t know why because he knew about both.

He’s made me believe I am an AWFUL person for my reactions to scenarios and I have spent so many weeks hating myself and trying everything I could to become better. I took what he and everybody else said, self-reflected, felt terrible and went onto medication for my Anxiety and OCD plus, gained a regular therapist – something I wanted to do for a long time, but I was struggling with money, so I put it off as a non-essential which I do regret - he told me I should've gone into my savings for therapy (I'd already lent him 8k.) During our sessions, my therapist has learnt the entire situation, background, our relationship, my actions, his actions, trauma and our conversations regarding our text messages. My therapist has advised me I was protecting my mental health and that he possibly could be narcissistic – of course, she cannot give that diagnosis but has informed me to look at these signs and see if they relate.

Upon breaking up, (I’d moved to the other side of the world for him about 9 months before because he wanted to go,) I had to choose whether to stay where I had no support system or return home. He told me we didn’t know what the future held, and I needed to get better and fix myself if there was a chance we could reconcile, and he’d miss me but I was hurting him and he needed to heal.



Background of the Relationship:

When we were teenagers, his mother kicked him out of his home, and my family and I took him in because he had nowhere else to live after we’d been together for only 8 months, I was 15 at the time. I’ve always supported him, encouraged him not to sever ties and continue to try and communicate with his family. I’d ensure they were sent cards on special occasions and gifts etc. Eventually, after a few years, he didn’t want to continue speaking to them because he didn’t want his mother or his mother’s side to know about his life. He still had contact with his Dad who lived overseas – I’d contact his younger sisters, I spent my wages on flights across the world to go and visit them, I’d coordinate their Christmas presents, arrange Facetime calls etc. After a couple of years of frequently visiting his Dad who was an alcoholic and previously caused issues when we visited his family, his Dad became verbally abusive to us both and kicked us out the home whilst we were staying with them – his step-mum also continued sending us horrible messages on a group chat after we left, I had just turned 18 at this point. After this, my ex decided he didn’t want to have contact with them. During those 4 years of no contact, I continued to try and maintain a relationship with his sisters, wishing them Merry Christmas, Happy Birthday etc. I kept asking if he wanted to rekindle with them because I know what it is like to lose family members and wish you would’ve had a closer relationship with them before it’s too late. He denied. Eventually, after 4 years, his father reached out to him again via telephone, and told him he was sober and that he was doing better now – he sort of apologised but not really more ""the past in the past so it doesn't matter anymore."" 

My ex and I had intimacy issues – he became distant and stopped initiating when we were in our early 20s. For about a month or two, I just put it down to life circumstances and stress. But, he also has depression so, after that period, I started to worry. I kindly approached the situation and he told me he was stressed so I encouraged him to seek support from a therapist or a doctor. He goes on to antidepressants and is hit with all the side effects. Apathy, loss of libido, irritability etc. For about the final 3 years, he didn’t want to have sex, we didn’t kiss, we barely hugged, we didn’t really get naked around each other – it felt like a roommate situation, I’d initiate but eventually hated the rejection. I communicated all of this to him, and sought advice but he'd get annoyed that I was bringing it up and said I didn't care about him because it stressed him out. I tried to take the pressure of sex and reconnect, I suggested ways of doing this without sex, I researched, we got sex toys, I bought SO many sets of lingerie – I tried to spice things up, I did everything I felt like I could to support him and fix the relationship issues.  The longest we went without sex, anything sexual and kissing was over 8 months – and the average was around once every month or two. I’d reached out so many times on Reddit, and to professionals online for advice – he told me he had trauma from a previous relationship, stress, financial issues, physical health issues  – I tried to help him work on all of it as best as I could (my OCD became much worse during this time, I worked with a therapist and had meds so I could try and support myself and him.) 

After this, my boyfriend broke up with me for the first time. I tried to go no contact, he messaged me every day and I love him so I kept responding. We got back together after a month or so and he told me he was in a bad mental space, he regretted everything and he’d never let me go again and kept telling me he couldn’t live without me. A couple of months later, he told me he's moving to the country his Dad lives in (where he was born) because he wanted access to better healthcare, I was unsure if I was ready to do so I took some time to think about it – I also had an important hospital appointment that I’d waited years for regarding my health condition that causes infertility and daily suffering – he booked his flight a couple of days before this appointment despite knowing that I had this lined up. If I wanted to go, I had to cancel that appointment – which is what I had to do. In hindsight, I shouldn’t have left when we already had relationship issues but I didn’t want to lose him and I felt long distance wouldn’t work after we’d lived together for around 7 years.

 

This year:

We leave and instantly he’s in contact with his Dad, he wants his Dad to pick us up from the airport, go out for lunch etc. I politely let my ex know that I wanted to freshen up after the flight and sleep so I didn’t feel comfortable with his abusive and ex-alcoholic Dad picking us up from the airport when I hadn’t spoken to him in years. We’d previously agreed we would reconcile together and my ex consistently tells me he wanted us BOTH to be apologised to before we moved forward with a relationship with them. He then goes out with him later that day to purchase a motorbike (we’d previously agreed to go half on a car so we both could get around but he insisted he needed the motorbike, and we were in a motorbike accident a year before where I was severely injured and couldn’t walk for months so he knew I wasn’t comfortable riding one) Then, my ex’s birthday – I plan the entire day for him, take him shopping, buy him clothes, give him gifts, buy a birthday cake, balloons, and make reservations at his favourite restaurant. Halfway through the day, he tells me he is going to see his Dad. I became really upset because I knew we’d then be late to our reservations and I also had the entire day planned which he cut short. I was upset and got emotional because I felt that my efforts weren’t appreciated and he walked out and left to go see his Dad.

After that, I didn’t hear much more about his family. He tells me he is working late so I prepare dinner as late as I can for when he comes home, most nights 9, 10 or 11pm. Then, he advised he couldn’t afford the place we were staying anymore and that we needed to move into his Dad’s house. I was apprehensive due to the previous experience but, I went along with it, I tried to be friendly with his Dad and see if he truly had changed. (He had not, he had stopped alcohol as far as we knew but was on drugs, he also tried to commit suicide in front of his young daughters multiple times and was charged with a DUI and still lived with his ex-wife – all of which was either completely hidden from my ex or the truth was withheld and I found out from his teenage sisters.) I helped around the house and did most chores, spent time with his sister's and family even if he wasn't home, we were sleeping on an air mattress in the middle of a kitchen.

One night, I was speaking with his sisters, without him there, they mentioned a memory and insisted I was there too – recently. I wasn’t. They then told me that my ex had been around the house whilst he was telling me he was working late and was lying to me and I was home preparing dinner for us. Before we moved into his Dad's house, he told me he hadn't seen anyone but his Dad and that it was going to be weird for us all to see each other again. His sisters tell me all the awful things his Dad has done and said to these young girls whilst we weren’t in contact – they are scared for their lives, literally. I comfort them, try to protect them as if they were my own siblings and tell them they can always come to us for help. This continued even after we left and to this day, they know they can contact me. They don't know that we aren't together as per my ex's wishes.

I felt so betrayed by him. This hurt a lot. I had no one but him in the country, I’d just left my family and my country for him, and he was sneaking behind my back weeks after we move whilst I tried to keep things running, continue to work myself and worry about accommodation (we were looking at properties) This reared some trust issues in me – I felt betrayed and had no one to turn to. The whole time, my ex was severely apathetic and selfish which he admitted to after coming off the antidepressants. I felt really hated in the last years of the relationship – we communicated about this and he assured me he didn’t hate me but his actions didn’t match.

We still lived in their house, I tried to forget it. I came to his medical appointments to support him and tried to just continue as normal in very abnormal circumstances. Then, he had a medical procedure which was pretty invasive and his Dad once again verbally abused us, threw chairs, turned the TV volumes up full blast at 4 am and just swore, standing over our bed making a ton of noise and putting his middle finger up repeatedly and is acting awfully – it was traumatic and terrifying. My ex told me to pack up our things and to leave as soon as I was done since he had to go to work (I worked from home so it was easier for me to deal with the mess,) I packed up our things, his sisters and I have a conversation, I tell them I am always there for them and we exchange “love yous,) agree that we will see eachother soon, whilst I left and packed up our things. Again, his Dad and step-mum message my ex horrid things but he ignores them and wants to lie about our location to his family members so that they cannot communicate and figure out where we were. Despite all this, I still try to arrange for us to meet with his sisters but he never wants to because it’s difficult. They message me and tell me they miss us and want to see us. I try to arrange karaoke nights since his sister loves singing, and bowling because we all enjoyed bowling a few years back and tennis because we purchased the equipment but never had chance to use it. Every time, he said he didn’t want to because all the information would get back to his Dad and his sisters would ask too many questions. We were moving around from place to place every 1-2 weeks because we couldn’t find stable accommodation among a rental crisis – we did this for about 9+ months and never settled, we were still moving around whilst he broke up with me.

We recognise we still have relationship issues between us that we need to fix after the traumatic situation with his Dad, especially now we’re away from his Dad but still unsettled. I suggested couples therapy – we agreed to it. Even a couple of days before he ended the relationship – he agreed to counselling together and said we’d work through everything. I have messages from him praying that we work out, that he hopes his insecurities never ruin the relationship, that he is grateful I was there and supported him through a ton of stuff in life, how incredible I am and how much he wants to spend his life with me etc. 

There were a lot of broken promises on his part, a lack of sex drive and affection and avoidance conflict – he told me my naked body didn’t do anything for him etc (really damaged my self-esteem and triggered aspects of my mental health conditions and I became very anxiously attached) He says that he wants to rebuild my trust and apologises for hiding things from me, I ask how he felt he could do that. We previously had location sharing via Life360 for safety purposes but he tells me that he could also keep that in place to build trust too. Then it stopped working, I kindly notified him that it stopped working, and he started acting weird and then eventually when I realised it still wasn’t working after a few days of him saying he’d fix it, that’s when the screenshots came in – I worked with a therapist to try and communicate my feelings and hear him out since I knew it was sensitive but I was still called manipulative and controlling on Reddit so I’m not going to do that again. 

I TRIED to encourage us to both make friends because we both had no support system – he told me he wanted to make friends, I gave him app suggestions like Bumble BFF, I said there were FB groups, I reached out to some groups I am in to see if anyone had boyfriends in the same situation or anybody wanted to meet as a couple – I watched him sit and swipe every person away and when I planned to go to couples meet or events, we ended up breaking up so we never did them. I encouraged him to stay in contact with his sisters, I also encouraged him to stay in contact with his Auntie and cousins who lived overseas who we had visited – I contacted them nearly every week to check in and make sure they were okay and regularly contacted them – they reached out after he told them that “he broke things off for us to heal,” and told me how much they love me etc. I never once tried to isolate him, I put my all into this relationship – so much so that I lost myself, I was just worried about whatever would make him happy, what I thought he wanted, which upon reflection I understand isn’t healthy either but I put everything into us.

I took accountability for everything wrong in the relationship, he believes I was in the wrong. But, afterthought, I believe we went through SO much and so many unordinary situations with mental and physical health issues plus family issues, plus no support system AND moving across the world and then interstate every 1-2 weeks, worrying about our next accommodation and trying to hold down jobs. We BOTH hurt each other by amplifying each other’s mental health or flaws. It was so draining. However, 3 weeks before he ended the relationship, he was telling me how in love he was with me, he got a huge tattoo which he incorporated my favourite flowers into, I went to every appointment with him and held his hand through the long sessions, packed him lunch etc. We booked a trip for Christmas together. A couple of days before he broke up with me, we seemed so happy. I have pictures of us looking at each other, crazily in love and laughing. The day before he broke up with me, were arranging a property inspection. Once he ended it, anytime I spoke to him and apologise or talk about things he said I was trying to manipulate him, he didn’t believe I loved him or cared for him.

During the time we weren’t together and were still living together, he slept in the same bed with me despite being able to sleep in a separate room if he wished, still invited me on errands with him, told me where he was going to be living and invited me to find an apartment nearby and ordered food for us but the stuff he said online was so horrible and accusatory. I still grabbed us coffees and food, checked in on him frequently and tried to apologise and talk. He gave me hope for the future. When I left and he dropped me at the airport, I told him I loved him and he did say “I love you too.” And, he gave me a hug.

He contacted me the entire flight home and checked in on me. I tried to go no contact. After three days, he checked in on me again. Afterwards, he kept trying to speak about my family dog – who we both adore and we were there when he came home as a puppy together – but I had to ignore the messages and go no contact again, it’s just too emotional and fresh and I am shocked he still wants to talk to me considering everything he believes about me.

I know we weren’t perfect, life handed us so much shit and we did our best to love each other through that, we were kids when we fell in love and even then, we didn’t have a “normal” relationship because we lived with each other at 15 and 16, we never knew how to be in a relationship – we just tried as best we could. I tried to support him, I lent him so much money, I saw him cry, I tried to work through the intimacy issues, I picked up the pieces from his parent and family issues, I sat there through the depression, the trauma he opened up to me about – I tried and I think I just neglected myself and my mental health in the process, trying to pour from an empty cup.

My OCD and Anxiety did get bad, but I didn’t care because I didn’t think it affected anyone other than me, and I felt like I deserved to feel that way so it was okay – which I learnt at the end it was affecting him too but it wasn’t intentional. But there were so many perfect elements for so many years, so many good times, so much love and care. And, I still do love and care for him. He really was my bestfriend and always will be.

 

TLDR;

My ex-boyfriend of 8 years broke up with me after misrepresenting our relationship online, leading to public accusations against me. I supported him through family issues including dealing with his abusive and alcoholic father and mental health struggles, moving across the world as he wished. Despite my efforts to address our relationship problems, he ended things suddenly after posting online and expressing love just days before and making permanent gestures to our relationship. Now, he’s reaching out post-breakup, and still gave hope for the future which complicates my feelings. I still care for him, but I neglected my mental health while trying to support him.",3,1730728006.0,Advice,0,0.8,False

[\\""This is Bone.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/d4n1pxs10wyd1.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=866f8573430e1139ae7f983edb65dce371bb7265)

After huge, huge highly anticipated week last week, we move into a crucial moment for the stock. If GME's price can consolidate around $22 (really above the 50-day moving average line) for the next week or so, many factors will converge projecting a decent, but patient move upward into November. This type of move will spell the makings of an upwardly trending channel as we approach Q3 earnings and the Implied Volatility rising tide/thumper effect that will precede it by and for approx. two weeks of trading. However, we've got to see what this coming week might look like first - especially as the whole market awaits Fed Jerome Powell's post election FedFunds rate announcement this Thursday (11/7). Is it ever not a ride? Let's go!

**Price Movement Recap**

[Trading 11\/1 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/o219zcikfvyd1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=a75130fca2df8c65e28d367ad4893cabcd863b24)

Whenever I approach my thoughts on a particular trading day or week and take a look at our data, I always try to ask myself ""if I had the power to manipulate or 'guide' the price in line with the currently tolerated mechanics of the market, how would I do so to make the most profit with the least risk?"" Major upward volatility on limited news that does not affect the fundamentals of the company always makes my 'bull trap' hairs stand on end. 

That's what we got last week in the wake of Keith's 13G filing for Dogstock. Friday's set-up presented traders with a highly concentrated, gamma positive trading environment that easily encouraged a repeat reversal trade off our downside support call wall at $22 up to $23.05 followed by a charm-aided sell-off into the close for this week's IV sellers to profit big time off of our tremendous appreciation off of last week's lows. Experienced traders and dealers made out like kings and, sadly, likely did so on the heels of a dubious short-term hype on the validity of MOASS beginning immediately.

Trading on the whole dipped back toward the lows we saw toward the second half of October, logging a low on the week of just over 4.5mil shares traded - an additional factor contributing to our IV depreciation and the profitability of such trades into the week's close.

Despite this slump, however, trading still remained decidedly above our $22 support - a major positive data point for expectations of our environment transforming into a clear macro-bull trend.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

With Friday's OI wiped out or rolled into this week and new contracts opened, our Max Pain for Friday as of now stands at $21 per Maximum-Pain, as it did last Friday.

[11\/8 OI Changes 11\/1-11\/4](https://preview.redd.it/4iavfdi6hvyd1.png?width=1062&format=png&auto=webp&s=3da2e0e2bf147489eedaea2b985feb7f3c68cad1)

We can see this week's numbers having been modified quite modestly in relation to our activity into and out of National Cat Day. Nonetheless, the current OI and trader attention to strikes at and above $22 in terms of Calls and Puts both projects further stability and consolidation above that mark as we head into 11/8 weekly options expiry.

[11\/15 OPEX OI Changes 11\/1-11\/4](https://preview.redd.it/hv5wnskkivyd1.png?width=1062&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fb1b7b502765d71abb59c5e7d925303853c8dbb)

As we look ahead to next week's November OPEX, that stability still looks to be in place. Traders notably targeted $21 to open new Calls - rather than $20 - and $22 to open new puts while some even closed Put trades at $21 and $20. These trades were relatively small, however, and sentimentally mixed, so there's not too much to read into in this respect. It is still significant to notice just how few puts there are on the board in general, indicating that traders are still prioritizing long and short call trades to take maximum advantage of likely anticipated IV swings and are not worried about purchasing puts for downside protection on their bets as of current. 

All of this suggests the persistence of downside volatility-suppressant conditions promoting stability and consolidation in our range at and above $22.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/tj2tow7plvyd1.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce8cc9a997fac1824961dd28c0e99c6e5d43db2e

As we take a look at the aggregate distribution of net Market Maker Gamma Exposure heading into today's trading we can see the persistence yet again of some common features of the hedging landscape. There is no meaningful GEX accumulation sub-$20, so major downside volatility is still off the table. In this respect, $20 forms a distal, but persistent downside support. While $20.50 has neutralized, this is likely the case of $20.50 being a half-strike of limited trading significance over the past week of significantly elevated price values. 

At the bottom of our chart we see the continued largest call gamma strike of $25 which still forms a distant upside resistance likely into November OPEX. Without any meaningful news or informational externality otherwise, any significant price breakouts over the next two weeks are likely to stay hemmed in by this very large level, especially as it will take significant amounts of new Call Gamma inserted above $25 in order to create profitability conditions palatable to MMs. 

As we take a look at strikes close to our current intraday trading ranges we can see a bifurcated channel forming up. $21 and $23 are proximal range gamma brackets of nearly equal volatility-suppressant strength with $22 as similarly volatility suppressant pivot point in the middle and $24 as another level of similar strength there above. These three brackets look to form high probability intraday brackets with the half-dollar strikes as higher volatility 'grooves' which traders will look to ping-pong off of.

If markets should react unfavorably to the FOMC announcements on Thursday, it is possible we might get a 'fake-out' leg down into the $21-$22 with a close that might try to drive the $22 calls OTM. It is possible, if volume picks up, however, that traders can attempt to run the $22-$23 range again multiple times, which is our most likely trading range heading out of the gates at week's open today. 

Because our general hedging conditions are so call-gamma heavy, these moves will likely not occur at a blistering pace, though in general we'll have to monitor options flows accordingly to see if we can't pick up any 'tells' for how MMs and institutions will be looking to play and guide the Stonk this week. 

**Technicals**

[7\/16-10\/29 1-Day Aggregation w\/ Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/84d1skpxdvyd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=edffe8cfdd34bd57dafaee47276dbffd44d7ba74)

[7\/16-11\/1 1-Day Aggregation Actual \(w\/ Short Term Inquiry Marks\)](https://preview.redd.it/r2v140gsevyd1.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=413c3ccd5ca0d881c4a051bb68ae9ce270d50d5d)

A week of consolidation would serve the stock well, especially if there is instability in the broader market surrounding FOMC. Doing so at the confluence of our 50-day SMA and $22 GEX level throughout the week would still permit volatility sellers the opportunity to profit off of their trades last week while providing enticing and stable conditions for bullish re-entry as we move into later November.

The pre-earnings, late November native IV ramp up is still a ways away, so there is plenty of potential sideways play still to transpire mid-month to optimize profits across the prospective pre-earnings date range. 

**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/yj9vq70rdvyd1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef389ef6bcceff14ed453a70b6c2352f4445207f

We can see the effects of last week's EOW consolidation, namely its return of our IV back to earth. Call Buyers will want to see IV levels flatten out a bit, barring any news, before re-entering or expanding long positions toward the second half of the month. If no news or major reports come through, an IV slump would entice some of those profits taken last week to re-enter, especially given December's squashed OI chain that presents the greatest opportunity out of any of our options chains to go critical given the proper sentiment, volume, and catalyst.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

Stable trading conditions about our current range are still projected by our current options landscape, though the decrease in overall volume likely spells an IV depreciation in the short term. Consolidation at and above $22 is still in the forecast as the stock looks to continue to make a case for the bullish uptrend forming and traders look to play large, whole-dollar call gamma positions for reversal trades intraday. 

As we closed decently above Max Pain last Friday, dealers might attempt to profit off of a delayed buying of shares per T+1 obligations (algorithmic hedging says they should have to, but this is a possibility).

We'll have to see how things shape up as we head toward the Fed announcement on Thursday (11/7) which poses some really major downside risk for the S&P. Whether that will affect GME in any significant way is anyone's guess at this point. We will have to be patient.

Major thanks to Richard Newton for continuing to point the community to our discussions here! It's my sincere hope that this analysis and discussion can help the broader GME investment community make better, more informed decisions as individuals with respect to each of our investments.

For those of you who are on X, I have, at the encouragement of several users, decided to start crossposting there.

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

i was left with one friend and now i even stopped talking to her. i don't know why and i've told her before that when i'm busy and stressed i don't want to engage in conversations or especially unplanned meetings/interactions.

i started to withdraw from all of my previous best friends and do my best not to be perceived or have a conversaion with any of them. i thought that this was a sign that i needed some growth and solitude and move on as our paths differ. i wasn't wrong but now i found myself to be all alone for weeks and almost a month now. i do everything alone, eat my lunch and have my coffee, work alone, i even went to the cinemas for the first time.

it's nice when you don't have to depend on anyone's needs overpowering yours but i've noticed this fear of perception is making my social interactions worse and i've become more irritated over little interactions with strangers or when they do something wrong. this leads me into a burst out, i can cuss them out right after it happens or i scream to myself and beat whatever is in my sight or sometimes i even cry so loudly, wailing. 

i really need help with why i started to ignore the last people that were by my side. i muted all their stories and messages and pray to god i don't see them on campus everytime which is so questionable, i understand. 

someone please let me know what's going on and how i can fix this. i don't think i want to spend time with them anymore. but i cannot seem to make them understand my condition and i don't know the root cause myself.",1,1730727319.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

I am a healthy weight, have always been active, and have a healthy diet. Out of nowhere, I began experiencing an increase in my abdominal girth that does not really have any other symptoms. I don't ***feel*** bloated, but my stomach is visibly distended (if I did not look down and see an increase in abdominal girth, I wouldn't know; it doesn't have a sensation). It is present 24/7 from when I wake up until I go to sleep.

One day, I was preparing for a wedding, and I did the following:

1. Took my spironolactone (which I take to lower testosterone) in the morning.
2. Drank lots of water and black coffee.
3. Wore my abdominal compression garment (meant for reducing post-operative swelling).
4. Didn't eat all day.

And I, for the first time since May 2023, had a normal stomach again. The interesting thing is that I have gone many days without eating until 6:00 PM, but my distension never resolved. Unless I do all of the above, there is never a change in my abdomen.

I suspected lymphatic causes a long time ago, but there was no free fluid seen on my ultrasounds, MRI, or CT scans.

1gje8wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/1gje8wf/cookies_like_marias/,Cookies like Maria's ,"Every morning I  have cookies with my coffee. It's under a hundred calories. More important I'm kind of obsessed with this style of cookies. 

They are  not extremely  sweet and the flavors are so subtle as to be almost  bland. I know  this doesn't sound like a cookie  you would obsess over, but they're incredibly subtle and pleasant. I feel like the more I say, the more it sounds like I'm  damming them with faint praise. 

If you haven't tried them, Gamesa Marias are the brand that a lot of people swear by. It's what I've been eating. Don't  tell  anyone  from Mexico I  said so, but as long as you're  not doing a side by side  comparison, Iberia Marias are just fine and actually  available at the local grocery stores, here in NY. Other cookies that fit the bill and  scratch the itch are Kedem Tea Biscuits and Leibniz Butter Biscuits.


I'd like to try to make my own, partly because baking is fun and partly so I know  what's  actually  in them. The only recipe I found to make Marias is improbable. All the other re ipes seem to be for things I can make from them. Recipes for tea Biscuits are either for biscuits or for digestives, made with whole wheat flour.

I was taken aback when he threatened divorce, and begged him to reconsider but he was adamant that our relationship was over.

I sobbed in the nursery as he packed up his things to leave. I watched his drink the coffee I had made him with a profound sadness in my heart.

I was awoken the next morning by the sounds of him trying to open one of the child gates to get out of the bedroom.

He swore at me in between trying to use his teeth to pick the lock. I picked up his limbless body and placed it on the bed, while knowing it was all I needed to guarantee my unborn child some siblings.

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####**1. Various Artists - This Is Stellar Vol.1 💎 [Stellar Audio]**  
*Recommended if you like: Hidden Gems™️*  

If you are into the newschool, techy, post-neuro, newrofunk, wizardry that's been cooking in the labs (heh) of many up-and-coming young'un's, or just have a good enough memory to remember our many talks about the subject, you will know Bristolian label **Stellar Audio** by now. If not, I've got the perfect excuse to gush about them once more: They just released their biggest project to date, a supermassive collection of only the most promising fresh names all across the techy spheres, **This Is Stellar**! 

Since the last time we talked about _Iwan ""Paarsec"" Lewis_' incredibly passionately run platform, Stellar continued its run of amazing singles with _Dapreme_'s You'ge deb-you, teamed up with fellow sickness curators _Yamatai_ and _Transparent_ for a superb shéllage à trois at Motion's Lockyard, supported _Eskei38_ on his UK eskeidition, sat down for an extended interview with the one and only _Rendah Mag_, and welcomed _James Hinton_ into the team. 

Before we get into this newest work of art released by one of my absolute favourite labels, I simply _need_ to talk about the artwork mister _RCOMTYPE®_ crafted for this particular collection. Scrolling down their wonderful discography, from the masterful early compilations to generative planets of the SOL series to the stunning single one-offs of the modern era, one can easily tell that Iwan has always highly valued the visual aspects of his label work - it's even stated in their mission statement! So it makes a whole lot of sense they would go all out for their literal biggest release yet, but who could have predicted it would go _this_ hard? I'd say go look for yourself to see what I mean, but basically, RCOMTYPE created his very own version of the _Voyager Golden Record_, the gold disc sent out on the Voyager probe, keeping in line with the imprint's often space-related themes. Not only is the idea already (literal) gold, the absolutely _gorgeous_ execution and the tons of fun little details sprinkled all over it make the concept go from _sick_ to _interstellar_, much like the vessel carrying its inspiration. Illustrations of the core aspects of our little scene, messages for its listeners, and, my favourite, a tracklisting that shows each track's BPMs through the degree of a corresponding arc. I love it so much!

Through the hardship of this long intro, we now move on over to the stars assembled by the Bristolian version of Carl Sagan, starting with 3 detailed picks and ending with a summary of the rest. Let's go!

**Pick 1: Aduken - Lose Myself**  
_Recommended if you like: IMANU, ABIS, Puzzle_  

First, we blast off with a ball of energy that should've been featured ages ago already: **Aduken**! Born in Jersey, sometimes based in London, but nowadays studying at the dBs Institute in Bristol, Giles Valeur-Adu has been making quite a stir in the music scene all around him since around 2021. Not just because he's got, like, some of the worst, very strongly held opinions ever, but also because of his actually lovely nature, immense passion for all sorts of music related endeavours and, of course, his skills both behind the decks and in the studio. Not only is he an integral part of Stellar's arch nemesis, _In The Lab Recordings_, he's also the mastermind behind _Grand Theft Audio_'s A&R process and part of the extended _Rampage_ family, a network that opened up doors to play at events like Crucast Bristol, Ministry Of Sound's Deadbeats crossover and Rampage Open Air, supporting the likes of Pendulum, Shy FX, Wilkinson and Hedex along the way. 

What he _really_ was and kind of still is obsessed with, however, is his futuristically techy production! After a slew of mindfully corrupted collaborations with Bristol's very own best DJ on _In The Lab_ and _YANA_, Giles ventured off a bit further, going the solo route for _Veil Of Darkness_, linking up with _Sola_ and _Shayper_, and even exploring the world of Dubstep he loves so much. That's right, he's one of those that's actually more excited for the Dubstep part of the Rampage lineups! At the tailend of a year full of massive tunes on _Redacted_, _Riot_ and _GTA_, hot off the heals of remixing _Bully_ and _Replete_ and a truly massive _REEBZ_ feature, and at this point a core member of the Stellar roster as well, he's now ready to drop his biggest tune yet - **Lose Myself**.

Moody pianos, hypnotising loops of synths and fast approaching drums lead us into a mad whirlwind of melancholic vocal chops that _will_ stick in your head, interrupted only by the intro synths' response, while the metallic drums keep switching things up between steppy and rolling. Sound design on point, vibes immaculate, (Adu)can it even get any better?

**Pick 2: Aksel - Archetype**  
_Recommended if you like: Rantik, Jon Tho, yanekcore_  

Next, let's talk about the name I keep mispronouncing in my head: **Aksel**! No Erele, either. Hiding behind this moniker is Cambridge-from but Bristol-based DJ/producer/general enthusiast _James Hinton_! During his Audio & Music Technology studies, he has been expressing his love for all things deep, dark, and in more recent times, futuristic and techy through various of his very own releases, which date back all the way to 2019. From a batch of SoundCloud-only free download type minimal vibes, James marched on to self-release tunes like _Awaken_, _Take5_ and _Beetlegeuse_, eventually earning him spots on imprints like _OTC_, _Nerium_ and, once again, _Redacted_! As is almost customary with techy-minded newcomers, Aksel has of course also tried out some 140 Dubstep, with his partner _CAERIES_ on vocal duty, along the way, but he always swerved right back into DnB, progressively becoming less and less minimal, and more and more melodic and techy. Especially this year's selection on _Duckland_ and _Genesis Sounds_ deserves a whole lot more ears than they currently get! 

That's not even close to everything he's got going on though! Under the **Aksel Productions** brand, he's also been composing tunes, and doing audio post production, audio editing and mixing work for _Generation Palestine_, a documentary about Palestinian's lives in Bristol, providing a good chunk of the soundtrack to a fellow student's final year project and reimagining movie and video game sound design moments he found particularly inspiring. Since finishing his studies, he's also become the venue manager at the LOCO Club in Bristol, and, most recently, joined the scrappy bois at _Stellar Audio_ as a resident/co-label-manager/I couldn't find a title but he's part of the team now! 

Now, James brings us some of his finest work yet, with the journey that is anything but **Archetypical** (close enough). Wasting not a whole lot of time, we are welcomed into the Bristolian's sound design world with an infectiously catchy rhythm of cheery plucks getting their jig on, while all sorts of distorted ear candies are slowly but surely joining in on the fun. As we take a bit of a breath in the breakdown, nastily vibrating basses  make their presence known, taking over the tune's second half with their quick-firey fluttery madness, before we jump back and forth between Half- and 4x4-time, and end it all with a more rhythmically straight-forward, yet still earthshaking, rollout. Absolute Aksellance. 

**Pick 3: 42CLO - Now Go**  
_Recommended if you like: Annix, Blueboss, Tom Dune_  

Lastly, something a bit different. Well, not _that_ different maybe. Of course, _Jordan Hall_, the man behind the heavyweight project **42CLO**, is _also_ residing in Britain, although I don't know anything more specific there. In fact, except for him ""feeling gooey"" 69 weeks ago, I have found basically nothing else through my usual deep dive through his socials! I do know that this mystery man has been actively releasing some straight _fire_ for quite a while already though. Since 2021, loud and break-heavy but always with a great emotional touch to it has basically been his sound, as evidenced on tunes like _CONNECTION_, _DREAM CHARACTERS_, or _MYLOVE_, but Jordan has always branched out into all sorts of other directions as well, like the Hip-Hop breakbeat-y tune _WITHOUT U_, the vast soundspace wizardry on _SC1-A_, the Trap-y bass bomb _burn with you_, or the heavy-hitting, wonderful weirdness of recent times. Not to mention his various remix projects for the likes of _Xeo_, _KAVARI_, _Dexndre_, and, well, Baddadan. 

Which brings us to **Now Go**, his Stellar debut release! If you thought some of his previous work was already quite massive, you might not be prepared for this one. The bone-chilling back-and-forth between pure grot scaling up and down and building-shattering quick-fire distortion action evolves through so many fun rhythmic variations of the grot it reorganises your brain cells more than just once, until you are left with a scrambled mess, unable to do more than put on your stankiest bassface. 

A truly Jordangerous tune. 

**Conclusion**

But that's just a fraction of the talent and the production this compilation has in store for us! We've got Tilburg-based banger-JFRYer **Fryware** with his uniquely rhythmic stabby exploration **Onigiri**, Andrew Gatehouse and Syd Walker unveiling their collaborative project **Compound** with the unbelievably weighty **Unbeliever**, Utrechtian Stellar regular **TER3NCE** with the moody, ever-evolving **Lead Follower**, Blackpool resident **Samath** showing that he is way better at production than at tennis with the beautiful roller **All of The Everythings**, Ryan **Revolve** Harris taking the tempo down to the 140s with the VISION Radio spotlighted **Sonorous**, grime enthusiast **Joel Ø-P** keeping the Dubstep flavour alive with **iLL**, Thailand-based talent **JAYSN** taking us deep into the 4x4 catacombs with **Void**, Toulousian finale aficionado **LoveTheEND** cranking up the vibes with the heavily vibey **Midnight**, German dream team **Quiver** and **Kenzura** unleashing their most athmospheric vocal chops onto the minimalistic yet _heavy_ **Elysium**, Dutch _FUTURE_ resident **Timo Noize** weaving together countless unreal melodies on **Resonate**, Austrian newcomer **Fokuz** providing incredibly catchy synth vibes on **Momento**, and yet another Austrian Landsmann **Onetral** (who we just talked about!) taking us to another dimension of sound with the finale **Love**. 

They did not lie on the cover, this really is stellar - from the gorgeous artwork to the endless amount of musical talent concentrated on this one album. 

Other techy things from this week:  
- Power Shift - Portrait 💎  
- Blacksite - Open Your Eyes / Solarpunk  
- Culprate - Normal EP   
- Various Artists - WAVE VA III  
- not techy, but that Natus LP on Fokuz deserves a massive shout-out!

I just left Stan’s with coffee in hand and I was standing at the entrance getting my pass ready on my phone when this tall black male with an orange coat suddenly kicked me in my face. 

My glasses fell off my face, I dropped my phone, and the kick broke my Apple Watch band and it fell off my wrist. Hot coffee poured all over my body. I was in a state of shock and couldn’t see. My immediate instinct was to run back into Stan’s. 

Shoutout to the witness who saw it all happen. Luckily, he found my watch and phone and brought it back to me before someone could’ve taken them. 

I called the police and they are on the lookout for this guy. If they find him, he will be arrested and charged with assault and battery. 

Would have never thought this would happen to me, especially in this area where there are so many people around. Please be safe out there. Don’t dilly dally and walk with intent. ",56,1730726762.0,cta,18,0.95,False

I quickly go ""oh my God.  I'm so sorry"" and start backing up.  

I hear him yell ""what the fuck is your problem you sick fuck!"".  Like I purposely wanted to walk in on a guy taking a dump.  

I go back and grab my coffee then sit down to work on my computer.  As I'm sitting there, I can see the guy walk out of the bathroom I walked into and dude sits down.  No coffee.  Just sitting there.  I can see him mean mugging me and muttering things under his breath.  I just ignore him and continue to finish up some emails for work.  

About 5 minutes later i see who I assume is the manager come greet him and take him to a seat to conduct what is Obviously an interview.  

I'm finishing up my work at this point then go use the restroom myself.  As I'm leaving, I walked up to the table the guy and manager are at and said ""if you hire this guy.  Please make sure he knows to lock the door when taking a dump"".  And walked off.

Why? 1) Trump is a former President, any objection -> look at his record and 2) Trump has an experienced SUPERSTAR set of individuals (Vance, RFKJr, Musk, Gabbard and Ramiswamy) and 3) The hidden invisible American forcefully shows up","Just to get this out there, for the record. Lots and lots of additional reasons to be optimistic in this election cycle, not the least of which are the reasons I mention above. So many regular people are now ""Motivated Harrys"" who will get off that couch and vote this Tuesday in numbers never seen before, and in numbers ""too big to rig"". In my favorite, non-manipulated social media X this morning (it's clear that Reddit is manipulated FWIW) I see someone reporting some 90K ballots dropped off literally the last day they can be accepted, with 40K of them deemed ""damaged"" in Arizona. Plenty of eyes out looking for fraudulent behavior in Georgia and Pennsylvania, what a difference this time around.

The suppression polls and other noise has been basically tuned out, the absence of a true ""October Surprise"" was great to see (knock on wood there's still today and tomorrow to live through), Trump's rallies are full-steam ahead, the early voting results have all pointed to a huge shift in behavior (a +15% swing from D to R since 2020, [source](https://x.com/OpenSourceZone/status/1852810970071974330)). On that last point, the EV is 40%/40% split between D to R, and you know plenty more R's than D's show up on election day. Also note in 2020 the total EV was 101M while this time it's a lot lower - 70M - and those 30M 'missing' votes are from all the COVID-era mail-in push and get-out-the-vote efforts by Dems (R's have historically discouraged early voting, and this cycle has encouraged it). For some data on the difference between R and D early voting results, here's [a table of data for you](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1852608489941553567).

A few more things point to having a great night tomorrow: a surge in what is called 'low propensity voters', these are people who are not called to a pollster, likely overwhelmingly Trump due to motivation. The other wildcard variable is how many men show up at the polls tomorrow (only 45% men voted early), the majority of men supporting Trump as well. 

So ignore the news the rest of today and tomorrow, go outside for a walk, grab a friend for coffee, read that book you put off reading while overconsuming political news for the past 3 months (man what a ride it has been), you have my permission, from an anonymous stranger! 

PS - this morning I saw this 7 minute video of an interested foreigner (Korean) who attended a Harris rally and a Trump rally and shares his thoughts about them. Really interesting and accurate. [YouTube link](https://youtu.be/J8sXuMjppTE?si=GaTPlDqMyoRWJcBw).

Apparently, to make the praline syrup you need white sugar, brown sugar, pecans, chestnuts, water, and vanilla extract. Then I believe they top it with some sort of Sprinkle of cinnamon sugar, ginger and cloves.

Any ideas how to go about this and ratios to start with?

Just want to share the nyc marathon tips I listened to from this sub that truly made a difference:
1. Getting east side grandstand tickets for my older mom and stepdad - no muss, no fuss. They didn’t need to stress about trying to catch me at a designated area, which then meant that *I* wasn’t stressed about them.
2. Not putting my name on my bib - this was counterintuitive advice, but made it a lot easier for me to hear my friends and family cheering me on (and allowed me to hear some random friends who I didn’t realize were coming out!!). If I was from out of town though or had less people spectating I absolutely would have put my name on 
3. Bringing toilet paper, thin blanket to sit on, and breakfast to the village. Was nice to have something to sit on while doing some stretches, and the toilet paper meant that I didn’t have to worry if a particular stall was out 
4. Meeting up at Lincoln Center afterwards - easy to spot post-run and get to with great photo ops! 
5. Having people cheer for me on the Upper East Side near 100th st - this is where I REALLY needed the support, and having my husband there made all the difference 
6. Fueling throughout race - I was sucking on dates, energy bars, and salt tablets throughout and experienced no real bonk.
7. Going early to the expo - I know not possible for everybody, but I went on Thursday and experienced minimal lines/crowding and everything I wanted was in stock!
8. Using a pace band - I’ve never had one before and it was SO helpful to look down on my wrist and know exactly what time I needed to be at with minimal thinking. 
9. Nothing new on race day. Perennial advice but I’m glad I used the same shirt, shorts, bra and sneaks I’ve been training in for all my long runs 

Advice I didn’t listen to and I’m glad I didn’t (not necessarily bad advice, just not for me)

1. Bringing a portable charger to the village. I’m not a huge phone person and was able to get by on low battery mode + turning off my cellular. I think not relying on my phone for entertainment really had me lean into the experience 
2. Not listening to music. Yes the crowd support is great, but particularly with Shokz it was really easy to take in both. I turned off music going up the Verrazano since that was truly magical, but kept it on for the rest (and sorely needed on queensboro bridge).
3. Not running with a water bottle. Tips were mixed but in general I felt comfortable knowing I always had my own water supply on me, and could dip into the race supplied water when needed.
4. Nothing new on race day. I have this in both sections because while I generally adhered to this rule, I also took it to mean that I should do what I have been doing, which is listening to my body/desires even if they weren’t exactly what I was doing during training (ie, eating a bagel the morning of which I’ve never done, some Dunkin coffee, etc). This rule is great for some things but I also think in its best form, allows for natural fluctuations and changes that might be needed the day of when you’re doing something big. 

Advice I didn’t listen to and I wish I did
1. Asking people cheering me on what THEY are wearing. You would think finding my husband in a crowd would be easy but everything truly is a blur!

Advice I didn’t necessarily see but I’m happy I did myself 
1. I know not everyone always has on hand support, but having my husband meet me at two points in the race (mile 7, mile 18) and refuel me with water and snacks made SUCH a difference 

And finally, all of the general tips around 9+1 (getting your volunteer spot early, getting races done early in the year) made it so much easier to accomplish this lifelong dream. 

Would love to hear from others what advice worked/didn’t work for them!

1gjdt1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gjdt1i/which_job_should_i_choose/,Which job should I choose?,"Hi there!

I'm at a crossroads and need to make a decision in less than a week, but I don’t know what to do. This year I graduated from university with a degree similar to international relations/tourism, I speak multiple languages and have work experience, but in my city it's really difficult to find a good job, specially one related to my field. Currently, I'm working part-time at a coffee shop franchise, but I don’t like the conditions or the environment and I have two potential jobs to choose between. The minimum salary in my city is around 1200 euros. I’m currently living with my parents, so I don’t have many expenses. In the future, I would like to get a Masters degree in some other European city, so I'm trying to save money for that. These are the two jobs:

* **Job 1:** In my current city, a management role with responsibilities in a tourism management field, stable and long-term. The salary starts at 1600 euros, with the certainity of increasing as I take on more responsibility. If I choose this one, I could leave the coffee shop now before Christmas time (surely it will be an awful experience).
* **Job 2:** A 9-month contract from March to November of next year (with the possibility of becoming permanent) as a receptionist in a hotel in another country with a LARGE company I’ve wanted to work for since I was a teenager. The salary is around 1700 euros, but I’d need to deduct about 400 euros for rent + food and other expenses. I’ve already signed a contract for this job, but I could cancel it—though that might mean they wouldn’t consider me in the future.

On one hand, I’ve never lived away from home or outside my country, and it’s an experience I’d like to have, especially in a structured setting like this large company (the lodging is provided by the company, some of you might guess which company I'm talking about), now that I’m still young (22F). On the other hand, I’ve been offered a job in my hometown, in an environment I’m excited about where I can save a lot of money. Nonetheless, I think if I choose Job 1, my chances of having that experience abroad might diminish the longer I stay and the more responsibility I take on.

I’ve been seeing a lot of creative marketing ideas recently, and it got me thinking about some of the unexpected ways small businesses are grabbing attention. Traditional ads and social media are great, but I’m curious about the more “outside-the-box” strategies that you all might be using.

For example, I recently read about a local café that started leaving short, funny notes and inspirational messages on takeout coffee cups—and it went viral on social media! Not only did it attract new customers, but people started sharing pictures of their cups, giving the café tons of free publicity.

I’d love to know if anyone here has tried a unique or unconventional marketing approach that worked surprisingly well. Maybe it’s a quirky social media campaign, a collaboration with another small business, or even something old-school like guerrilla marketing.

But then they vanish for 2-3 months and come back again. it’s like a circle that I got used to it . Normally through out the day when they give me a break I get them rarely maybe 1 or two a day after a workout or long walk. 
Done multiple ECG at the GP Echo, 24h heart monitor , blood work and etc all came back fine. Ive realised that coffee and big meals cause them for me too. Also notice them in the gym after I push my self a little and get my pulse around 140 I get a feeling of a big thud in my heart with an extra beat that scares me sometimes.

Second bothersome symptom that I can call new is vertigo a sensation of being dizzy all of the sudden when walking or looking and following an abject with my eyes, also head feels heavy with brain fog which makes me hard to concentrate reading a book or doing something on my laptop. 

Other than that chest pains and other symptoms like nausea bother me maybe once a month.

I’m a 26-year-old mom of a 9-month-old, and I’ve been struggling with intense health anxiety for the past few months. My anxiety really spiked after a traumatic experience where my husband fainted with his eyes open, and for a moment, I genuinely believed he was dead. Since then, I’ve developed a deep fear that something terrible could happen to him—or me—at any second.

My anxiety often makes me feel like I could die suddenly, and it’s hard for me to distinguish whether these fears are based on reality or if they’re just in my head. I know logically that it’s probably anxiety, but the thoughts feel so real, and it’s been hard to shake them. It’s affecting my ability to relax and enjoy life the way I used to. Dinner nights? Short vacations? Shopping? Coffee dates with my friends? Literally don’t enjoy them like i used to.
Ive been prescribed Zoloft but because of my health anxiety i’m too afraid to start it

I also have a 9-month-old son, and my responsibilities as a mom and my job add to the stress. I feel exhausted most days.

To manage my anxiety, I’ve been taking two capsules of ashwagandha daily, but when I tried cutting the dose to one capsule, I experienced a surge of anxiety and intrusive thoughts, which freaked me out and made me reluctant to adjust the dosage again. And i’ve been taking them for about a month and I’ve been feeling better but still have a surge of anxiety and intrusive thoughts.


I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been through something similar or has found effective ways to manage these intense fears and health anxiety. Any advice or tips on balancing motherhood, work, and mental health would be much appreciated.

AI Enhanced Version:
On a bleary-eyed, early Monday morning, the 6 a.m. flight to Minneapolis had all the usual hallmarks of a pre-coffee, yawn-heavy boarding process. Passengers were settling in, some eyeing the aisle to catch a last-minute snooze, others already head-bobbing with neck pillows in place.

One woman, a bit disoriented from her drive, had taken what she thought was her designated window seat. But as luck would have it, that seat would be on her next flight, and her actual seat was the middle one. When two gentlemen arrived for the same row, they paused, double-checked their boarding passes, and realized she was in one of their seats.

Instead of the usual shuffle or a polite but reluctant seat switch, the two men exchanged a glance, and the one assigned to the window chuckled. “No need to move,” he said with a friendly grin. “If it’s okay with you, I’ll just slide into the middle seat.” He turned to his travel companion, nodding toward the aisle. “I’ve known this guy for ages. I’d rather squish him than have both of us squeeze you in the middle.”

The woman, visibly relieved, laughed along and thanked them both. She settled back into the window seat, a grateful smile spreading across her face, as the men, comfortably cramped as only seasoned travelers can be, settled in beside her. The rest of the passengers in the nearby rows caught a bit of the vibe, and soon the quiet hum of contentment filled the cabin.

It was a simple act, but it set the tone for a surprisingly smooth boarding experience, with people settling in a bit easier, nodding politely to each other, and even exchanging sleepy smiles. For an early Monday flight, it was a rare but welcome dose of kindness—a reminder that even at the crack of dawn, on a flight full of strangers, a little compassion can go a long way.

As the plane taxied to the runway, the woman looked out at the rising sun with a renewed sense of optimism, grateful for the small gesture that had turned a groggy, rushed morning into a positively bright start to the week.

It sometimes gets so bad that I feel the urge if yelling or crushing sth. Improvisational dance and sports help a lot I figured out. 
I also feel like it is connected to my cycle, it's worst during my period until ovulation and then declines after ovulation until it rises again a few days before menstruation. 
Also I feel it is connected to my intestines or my bowels since sometimes when it builds I need to fart and the feeling of tension immediately afterwards declines. 
Also coffee is making it way worse. 
I don't know what's going on with my body, can anyone relate in any way to these symptoms?

[Sage/Breville Barista Pro],"First time home barista here, so apologies if detail is lacking or I'm doing something obviously wrong. Recently bought a Sage/Breville Barista Pro and while I'm confident my technique is improving I'm still not getting ideal shot times. Is it a known issue with this machine that factory settings for the grinder seem to be waaaaay too coarse? 

Took the external dial right down to 1 and was still running far too quickly, so have now changed the internal burrs to 3 rather than default 6. With this I've managed to get respectable shots using a fairly dark roast on external grind size 4. I've now started using medium-dark beans from the same roastery and finding that again the shots are way too fast - barely 15 seconds even now using internal burr setting 2 and external dial 1. Realistically do I need to go down to internal 1 or am I doing something else wrong here?

  
Beans are roughly 4 weeks from roasted date, so assuming this isn't the issue. Using the single wall double shot basket, trying to keep it consistently to 18g of ground coffee. Interestingly the grind time at this grind setting is now 18 seconds, which is maybe an issue? Pucks on the medium-dark roast are more soupy than the dark roast was, but seem to be intact so I don't think channelling is an issue here form what I can tell.

  
Interestingly, the shots don't actually taste terrible, i.e. not incredibly sour, but I'm confident it'd be a lot better with a longer extraction time. So, any advice on what I may be doing wrong, or if I just need to commit to the finest grind setting would be incredibly appreciated.",0,1730723797.0,espresso,2,0.5,False

Sorry I have not been around lately!  I thought everything was just fine in my little workshop on the beach. The sun was shining, the waves were crashing, and my merry elves were busy crafting gifts as they always did. But I felt like something was off. Different. I’d catch them whispering when they thought I wasn’t around, and their usual smiles seemed just a tad forced. I kept brushing it off, thinking they were just tired from the holiday rush, but a nagging little voice told me I was missing something important. Still, I chalked it up to pre-holiday jitters. Oh, how wrong I was… how wrong… I was 😭. 🏖️ 🦞 got a rude awakening this week!  I will tell you more about it 
tomorrow. 

Part II
Since I knew the holiday rush was getting to everyone, the next morning, I decided to check in and lift their spirits, but the moment I entered the workshop, the usual hum of happy elves working away was gone. Instead, I was met with little picket signs! “Fair Seas, Fair Treats!” they read, and “Breaks for Beach Days!” My mouth dropped open. I asked Coral, my chief elf, what in the sandy depths was going on, and she hesitantly told me they were forming a union. A union! Can you believe it? They said they were overworked and didn’t have enough time to enjoy the beach they loved so much. I couldn’t believe my little elves were unhappy—wasn’t this work supposed to be a joy? My jaw dropped and knew a storm was coming and 🏖️ 🦞was going to get wet if she didn’t find an umbrella quick!  Man… retelling this story is stressful. More tomorrow!

Since I’m in town - I thought I would see who all have been good little boys and girls - and if they would like a 🎁.

My clicks are *given without the expectation of reciprocity.* I like to try and pay things forward anywhere I can. I used to try trading but it’s so annoying to see “I’ll do yours if you do mine but YOU have to go first - only to be hosed by a cheater/scammer who feigns innocence). For the most part - my clicks end up going unused… wasted because after being tricked so many times - I was over being fooled/scammed and feeling bitter and disappointed in my fellow crabs. So I have adopted the - I simply will do something nice because I can. Because I want to. **Without an expectation of quid pro quo.** That takes away the feeling of being taken advantage of. 

That said - should people be in a giving spirit. That you feel inspired to be a giver - Sandy Claws always enjoys opening her game and seeing a *surprise* gift of generosity. It brings the warm fuzzies. But please - don’t ruin the surprise. If you give a gift - donate anonymously. Do it because the spirit of giving moved you - not because I did something for you first.

positive comments:
- like gpgp, it still is relaxing to play. it's like gpgp but with coffee.

- i really like some of the drink recipes and enjoy making them.

negative comments:
- there are times when costumers don't like their coffee even if i did it right. i always check it after the day if i really did it wrong, but it's really right tho. so it really confuses me whenever that happens. but there are also times wherein i serve the same exact drink at a different time, and they liked it. so it's really confusing for me.

- the happy meter of the costumers seems to go down faster than gpgp, kinda not sure about this because i haven't played gpgp for months now.

- less selection of decorations and equipments. it's understandable tho because this is just the early access of the game.

- the decorations and equipments are pricier. most of them are at 1000 at minimum. i'm kinda not used to it because the things in gpgp are cheaper.

- there is a learning curve in making some drinks. some drinks require you to put in ingredients in a specific order or else the costumers won't like it. this is definitely more challenging than gpgp, but i love that aspect of it tho.

- there are less development to the storyline. you'll usually get to talk to the characters only at the beginning of a level. chapters don't exist also. but again, it's okay because this is only the early access of the game.

- there also a some kind ""energy"" in a form of coffee. wherein you'll get 10/10 energy at the start of a real day. and each fake day at the game you play, one energy will be deducted. therefore, you can only play 10 games at a time. you'll have to wait one hour to get one energy. overall, you'll have to wait 10 hours, if you managed to empty your energy, to get 10/10 energy again. i honestly don't like this aspect because i can't play it unlimitedly, unlike gpgp.

to conclude, here are my suggestions:
- they should definitely fix the issue about the costumers not liking the drink even if it's made properly.

- more decorations and equipments please.

- cheaper decorations and equipments please.

- they should scratch the energy thing.     

this game have so much potential!! i hope they can improve it further. i'm looking forward to its official release. 🫡",5,1730723686.0,GoodPizzaGreatPizza,2,0.86,False

Advice?,"Me (19M) and my girlfriend (19F) have been together for almost 2 years. Due to her parents going travelling, she had to move out only a couple months after we started dating and, not wanting to be alone, she asked me to move in with her - I had my own family issues at the time and was more than happy to.

From what she’s told me, she’s had bad anxiety since about 13 and though it’s gotten better over the years she still suffers from it. Im no stranger to mental health as I suffer from depression and take antidepressants daily - so I feel I’ve always been quite understanding when it comes to her mental health and supporting her.

However, over the time we’ve been together she’s become increasingly controlling. Everything has to go to plan, we eat when she wants to, we get up and go out when shes ready, nothing major but enough to feel like i’m losing control of my own path a bit.

On top of that, It feels like I dont have much of a personal life outside of her, but when I do go out without her I find myself having to tell her where i am - even though she has my location, having to message her regularly and constantly telling her whose with me while having to explain myself if theres another girl there, even if it’s a complete stranger.

This is only my second relationship so Im not sure how much of this is normal or not as my best friend seems to have similar issues with his partner.

However I finally came to the conclusion the other day that i needed a breath of fresh air. I told her i needed space and i was going to move back in with my dad for a few weeks until we move into the house we are buying together. We still see eachother regularly, we work at the same company 5 days a week, and we go out for coffee or dinner and its mostly alright. 

While we’ve been apart though, I feel like im seeing things from a different perspective. Im enjoying the time apart, it feels like i can finally breath again. But i feel myself getting closer and closer to breaking up with her, leaving myself with this guilty feeling that I’m a bad person and its unfair of me to leave her because i know that the way she’s acted is only due to her anxiety.

I do love her and i think shes an amazing person, but this has been going on for so long i just dont know if i can keep waiting for her to change. We’ve spoken about the issue before, she said she’d get councelling and never did. Now, a few months down the line shes saying it again but i feel like its already too late.

Im not very good at putting together a coherent explanation so I hope this makes sense. Does anyone have advice on the situation? Is mental health a valid reason to breakup?",2,1730723594.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

Over the years we have hooked up a few times every few months or so but i know she would never commit or give me another chance and i just can't seem to shake the feeling or wanting her, our sexual connection is AMAZING i've never had anything come close to it before or since. She's my dream girl

What usually happens is she will invite me to her work (she is a bartender) for a beer and we hang there and sometimes hook up and then she inevitiably ghosts me and if i confront her about it she says we don't need to talk daily and how sometimes she gets addled with attention and she ""enjoys her peace"". Months go by again and then out of the blue sure enough she will write me and i just don't have the willpower to shut her down. I try and convince myself - 'man the next time she writes me i'm going to tell her to leave me alone because honestly this is killing me' and i always give in. I try and invite her out casually to walk our dogs or for a coffee or anything else really she always has an excuse . Eventutally our chats will slow down and she stops writing me and then a few months later i'll get another message ""You free tonight to come for a beer?"" again to her work of course and i ALWAYS get exctied and jump at the opportunity to see her again. When i tell her i have feelings or anything she always says she is flattered and i'm good for an ego boost but then she tells me she might hook up with people at her work or whatever and it crushes me everytime. When i tell her i hook up with other people i can tell she is kinda annoyed and like tells me why i would hook up with them and will usually make me feel weird about it.

1gjcyow,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1gjcyow/am_i_understanding_this_wrong/,Am I understanding this wrong? ,"Am I reading this encounter wrong? 

A week or so ago I hung out with a group of friends. These friends were friends first and I was added to the group later on. 

I am the only one in the group who has their own place to live (no roommates, no parents) so I offered them to sleep at my place after a long night out. When we got back as I was blowing the air mattress up for them I heard of them ask another “coffee in the morning?” Under their breath. I ignored it bc maybe I heard wrong, maybe they were going to invite me idk. There’s no way they were being shady in front of me, in my home I opened up for them, right? Fast forward to the morning and I hear them all awake so I go out and start cleaning up blankets and stuff and one of them calls a family member over sees and they are asked what they are going to do for the rest of the day. He responds “we’re going to get coffee” and I catch as his voice trails off like he made a mistake. I watch the two other “friends” look at each other and at this point I know they really were making plans without me, in my house. I know the vibe changed because situations like this devastate me and this group of friends is more than aware of my trauma and insecurities around groups of friends and situations exactly like that happening to me. They must have felt the vibe changed bc then they all crowded me and asked if I wanted to go to coffee with them. I reluctantly said yes even tho it felt like a pity invite and while out with them it just felt awkward and like I was intruding. Now they keep talking about how fun it was but I’m not interested in hanging out with them and especially not interested in inviting them all over to my place ever again. I can’t tell if I’m being dramatic or if I somehow read this situation wrong or what but my feelings are very hurt. At the same time part of me is thinking “well of course it happened this way. This is how groups always go for you, why would you expect anything different?” 

Edit: for context they were already done getting ready, bags were packed and ready to go when they asked me if I wanted to go. ",2,1730723066.0,AutismInWomen,6,1.0,False

So I’m wondering if it would look bad to show up an hour or so early to get coffee there before explaining that I’m there for an interview. ",1,1730722977.0,jobsearch,0,1.0,False

I decided to take the plugin out today and now my game crashes after the intro. I usually only have problems when I install bad mods and try to play the game, not when I try to take out an old clean one ahaha

Does anyone have any ideas why this mod is still attached to my FNV even though I sorted everything through MO2?

Packed with essential minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants, it’s a powerful ally in supporting overall health. Here are a few ways to incorporate it into your routine:

1. Make Sea Moss Gel

* How to Prepare: Soak the dried sea moss overnight, rinse it, then blend with water until smooth.
* How to Use: Add a spoonful of the gel to smoothies, coffee, tea, or juices for a nutritious boost. The gel lasts up to 2 weeks in the fridge!

2. Add to Foods 🍲

Use sea moss gel as a thickener for soups, sauces, and stews. Its texture blends well, adding creaminess without altering flavor. For those following keto, it works great as an egg white substitute in certain recipes.

3. Enhance Your Skincare

Sea moss gel can be used topically. Apply a thin layer as a face mask for 15-20 minutes, then rinse with lukewarm water. This helps hydrate, balance skin tone, and provides a natural glow!

4. Boost Nutrition

For a quick nutrient intake, simply add Moroccan Gold Sea Moss to salads as a crunchy topping, or stir into your favorite salad dressings for a mineral-rich twist.

With its almond-like flavor and mild sea undertone, Moroccan Gold Sea Moss adds both taste and a wealth of nutrients to your diet.

Ready to start? Visit [Bwinto.com - All Natural](http://bwinto.com/) and explore the pure, naturally grown Moroccan Gold Sea Moss. Experience the benefits of nature’s best 🌱🌊.

1gjcstl,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineJobsatHome/comments/1gjcstl/hire_me_pleasee/,Hire me pleasee.,"I am 22 years old, male and a fresh graduate (BSN). I have applied more than 50 jobs, including online jobs. Sadly, there's still no one hiring and contacting me.

I badly needed a job to cover my bills. Supposedly, I was applying due to the expenses I need to settle because I am going to take the Board exam, next in May 2025. Things turn out in different way. 

I was recently scammed due to fraudelent activity. My friend helped me to settle my tuition. The caller which was the scammer. Introduced herself as from my School, She knows information such as the cut-off line of the cashier, Refund on-site, etcetc. My friend which was just helping lost money because of me, whose intention is just to help me. Amounting 31,433 pesos.

I need to pay for it, I have tried everything, and in facebook its just all a scam. I applied in Dunkins, Coffee shops, Restaurants, Delivery bot, etc. I have tried freelancing but they always requires damn experience.

I am so lost, I do not know how can I start. But I am not giving up, Can you please suggest or provide sites that's legit so I can start settling this so I xan focus on my studies for my licensure exam.

I can edit simple task using capcut. I can utilize Canva, proficient in English, can type 62-70 wps, I have experience in using Ms word, excel, pdf's, I have knowledge on medical terms, and I have time to devote on.",1,1730722498.0,OnlineJobsatHome,1,1.0,False

Just wondering where there are some good places I can stop at to work between field visits like cute coffee shops, etc. Places that don’t mind people working there. like today I will be in Stratford then Newtown but I’m unfamiliar with both of those places.

1gjcq83,https://www.reddit.com/r/BloomingtonNormal/comments/1gjcq83/need_a_ride/,Need a ride?,"I'm trying to get some work in as a freelance driver. For rides I strongly prefer to schedule in advance, really not trying to be an uber but I'm willing to maybe go out on call sometimes especially if I know you or if you have ridden with me before. Daytime only please or early morning. No smoking.


$15 flat in town, willing to consider driving longer distance. Also willing to pick up and deliver things but that's an extra stop so it would be more depending on how many things/how much time to get etc. Still cheaper than ubereats/doordash probably, I follow delivery instructions, and I'm not playing with multiple apps or messing around getting your food cold. Can also do jumps or roadside tire plugs.


About me: I'm 39 and have been driving and owned my own cars since I took Drivers Ed in high school and got my license then. I drove professionally as a delivery driver here in Bloomington/Normal for 10 years for various restaurants. Have never had a suspension or DUI. Learned roadside maintenance on the job and eventually started just doing most work on my car myself.


About my car: It's a fairly well kept Gen 2 Prius from 2006. In its prime at 128k miles. Up on all maintenance, recently just flushed coolant, replaced hybrid battery with a brand new aftermarket upgraded pack, changed sparkplugs and oil. Brake pads are due next oil change. Clean interior with seat covers and bluetooth radio adapter you can use if you want. Hatchback with great capacity. I can fit 8' boards in here with it closed, or at least $1000 worth of Chinese food.


If you're still reading I can also do sound for your event, record, roast you coffee, property maintenance work, fix gadgets, and help with creative things. I'm a jack of many trades who is bored, a little hungry, and looking for any kind of interesting part time projects.",0,1730722249.0,BloomingtonNormal,0,0.5,False
