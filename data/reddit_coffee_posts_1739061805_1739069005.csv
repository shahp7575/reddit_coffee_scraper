1il4mxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1il4mxn/going_for_it/,Going for it!,"I'm 41M and always thought I was a bit ""off.""  In the 1990s, AD(H)D was what you seen and heard on TV.  ""In this presentation-oh look squirrel!""  

I've had so many hyperfixations.  If I played a video game based on a movie, I had to watch the movie and know everything about it. I was immersed into the Titanic wreck in 1995, Garfield the cat, how commercial aircraft are built, the list goes on. 

Math was never my strong suit.  Once I got into Algebra, I would almost have a meltdown looking at the equations.  My mind would ""shut off"" and I couldn't absorb what was being taught. 

Now that I have a better understanding of what ADHD really is, I'm going to get the official diagnosis.  My concerns are the meds.  If I'm on a stimulant like Adderall, do I give up coffee?  My family has a history of heart disease.  Could my chances of a heart attack increase?  On that note, I don't drink or smoke but, I do eat a lot of sugar.  

What was your experience with stimulant and non-stimunlant meds?  Did the executive disfunction stop while on meds?

1il4ke9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1il4ke9/breville_oracle_touch_loud_noises_when_not/,Breville Oracle Touch - loud noises when not powered on then nothing and not heating.,"Hi Coffee Lovers,

I have a Breville oracle touch that has had some issues as of recent. It all started one day by making a very loud noise (much louder than normal) while powered off. Only unplugging the machine from the wall would stop the noise. It would not brew at this point as the temperature would not go past 70 degrees but the steamer still worked and so did the hot water.

After trying to diagnose, the noise stopped but then so did the hot water and steamer. Brew temp stayed at 70-80 degrees and the steamer temp read ready but nothing.

Going into advanced settings and debug mode showed a Coffee boiler NTC not responding and communication errors.

Clicking hot water would turn on the pump but no water came out. Clicking the steam feature emitted a faint hum but no steam. I checked the all points on the solenoids with a volt meter while turning hot water and steam on and off and no changes on any pins. 

I took the main triac board off from the top and found this..(see pic). I believe this is the culprit and board is cooked which explains why it was making loud noises even though it was turned off and now why nothing else works. 

While apart I checked all the lines off the steam boiler and coffee boiler and everything is clean and water flows to and from as it should. 

Does the diagnosis sound correct? Does anyone know where I can get a replacement 120v triac board for this? I have seen a couple 240v from Aus and NZ on Ebay and the like but nothing for the 120v.

 I am also planning on contacting Breville this week for parts, do they sell the triac boards? Thank you.",2,1739068454.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

[soap and candles ](https://imgur.com/a/LxQtLoA)

These were a clusterfrick of a process. Tried to cold process which quickly turned into hot process method...due to 15° weather I got instant volcanoes/foam and false trace.
Fought the batch for an hr or so...then let it sit for a couple days, and rebatched it.

These are;
Lye
Lard
Coffee
Kratom
Sunflower oil
Extra virgin olive oil
Psychotria Viridis leaf
2 useless small soy wax melts that likely burnt up
Oxidized/DeAd cocoa/Shea butter and eczema lotion


The candles are just lard and various discounted wax melts scented with different cedar/fir wood. Smells like a forest basically. 

Bit off way more than I can chew but at least my broke butt can take a bath for the next handful of years without worry.

1il4i8c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1il4i8c,$975/mo. - Room in 2B2B - Downtown Beaverton,"My current roommate is moving out, and I work for the property, so I am looking to transfer into a different 2B in the same building. Move-in date is scheduled for 2/20. Rent including my discount is at $975/month per person.

Utilities are not included in the rent, but there is free WiFi. Water, sewer, garbage, gas, and electricity will be split in half. Street parking is available and there is reserved parking in a gated lot available for $150/month. My current apartment is fully furnished, besides the 2nd bedroom. However, I’d love to collaborate with my new roommate if they have their own furniture. 

I have 2 dogs and 2 cats, so the new roommate must be pet-friendly. Unfortunately, there is no room for more animals. 

Some things I’m looking for in a roommate:
* Mature & communicative
* Clean (picks up after themselves in shared spaces)
* 420-friendly
* Accepting & open-minded

Some more details about me:
* Liberal, accepting, clean 33 year old highly-functioning stoner (she/her)
* Full-time employee (works Tuesday-Saturday)
* Planning to move to WA in one year to live w/ boyfriend (boyfriend visits for the weekend about twice a month)

More details about the apartment & community:
* New building close to Fred Meyer, Trader Joe’s, Target, and a seasonal farmer’s market - not far from Nike, Intel, and local transit
* Near tons of great restaurants, bars, and local businesses - shares retail space with an awesome pizza place & coffee shop
* Secure building with keyless entry

* You must submit an application and sign a 12-month lease to become a resident, which means you will be subject to a background check and rental screening

This is a very unique situation, and is definitely not a good fit for everyone, but it would be great for someone looking to save some money and live close to work. I will provide the name of the property and the address to serious inquiries. Please send me a DM if you’re interested.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Steve Earle once said, "" Townes Van Zandt is America's greatest songwriter. And I would stand on Bob Dylan's coffee table with my boots on and say that."" In a Rolling Stone magazine article.

To which Townes, who was still amongst the living funnily said, "" I've seen Bob's body guards. I don't think you'll make it to the coffee table.,"" 🤣

Not long after saying that, Steve ended up opening for Bob, and Bob didn't talk to him about it, I m not sure if he talked to him much at all, but Bob obviously has a day in who his opening act is. And Bob's only response was to play "" Pancho and Lefty"" on the opening night of the tour. 

As if to say, ""it's art, it's not a competition , I like Townes too."" 

Steve's remark was basically a somewhat back handed compliment, "" yeah, I know everyone else thinks Bob is, and I myself have even covered Bob, but I'm singing Townes' praises."" And I think that is the way Bob took it, to Bob's  credit.

But it must be hard, being declared the BEST, to the point where people trying not to appear to be syncophants, even if they think it themselves ( critics). Or people, like Steve, favorably compare another songwriter to you, even name checking you, just because YOU are the benchmark. 

It reminds me of Bob's MusicCares speech, paraphrasing "" what makes me so special? I don't annunciate? You ever listen to Muddy Waters? I sound like I gargle with drano? You ever listen to Tom Waits or Charley Patton? What makes me so special?"" 

I haven't met him, but, I think he is actually quite humble. "" Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft"" ( if you see her say hello),  but as a Dylan fan, even I'm defensive on his behalf when they put him on a pedestal and then proceeds to try to knock him off of it. I'm glad he lived long enough to just have critics stop taking pot shots at him.Just to defend themselves and their critiques , as not being syncophants or syncophantic of their own hero   And just sing his praises.

 Lord knows Steve Earle would never bring up Townes worst song and eviscerate it, just to make it clear he isn't simply engaging in hero worship. ",1,1739067777.0,bobdylan,3,1.0,False

There are a few parts left on eBay and Amazon, but they're really expensive, so I'm looking into alternatives to switch to.

The main two features I need in MTB pedals/cleats are walk-ability and lateral float.  I use my mountain bike for everything, including going to the store or meeting friends for coffee and whatnot, and need a recessed cleat that is walkable.  I use shoes like Giro [Terraduro](https://www.giro.com/p/terraduro-mountain-bike-shoes/350060000200000017.html) and [Berm](https://www.giro.com/p/berm-mountain-bike-shoes/350060000200000075.html), and [Tommaso Vertice](https://tommasocycling.com/products/vertice-100?_pos=1&_sid=e1aeb0630&_ss=r), fwiw.

The other requirement is lateral float, which both Speedplay (now [Wahoo](https://www.wahoofitness.com/devices/pedals/speedplay)) Frogs and SPDs have.  Due to past knee injuries I need zero lateral strain on my knees.  Frogs have something like 20degrees of non-centering free float, which is perfect, and which I'd like in other pedals if possible.

I spend a decent amount of time at work. I also do stuff like go to the gym. Then there's the usual life stuff like running errands and shopping. Visiting friends etc.

I am still here at the house with my retired parents a lot though. It's just how it is. I try to keep myself out of the house, but it's not always realistically possible unless I have somewhere to be or an idea to pursue (buying lunch etc.)

My mother coughs and sighs about 1000 times a day. It's always sudden and sharp and loud. She never stops. She is also a heavy smoker and drinks every night, some nights getting drunk.

Today I fucking snapped. I've never had this happen. I spent the first 3 hours of the day watching crap on my laptop, had a few coffees, ate lunch and cleaned up, and prepared some things for my day tomorrow. Today is one of those days I genuinely don't need to leave the house for anything.

Well, she was coughing and sighing and closing doors harder than needed all through this morning period since I woke up. I was in my bedroom putting some things into a dresser and packing a bag when I heard her coughing loudly and persistently and I realized that this is all I had heard all morning. I then stopped what I was doing and sort of looked around my bedroom in somewhat of a panic. I actually said out loud 'stop'. Her coughing continued. I just started shaking and then punching the air and then bit my fucking finger and slapped myself in the side of the head a few times. This all lasted for like 10 seconds. I then was seeing stars and couldn't believe what had just happened to me. My response was overwhelming, and I've never done it before. Like, how did this come up so suddenly where I literally had no control. I was 'seeing red' in terms of how angry I felt. I could have punched through a door at the peak.

I'm now stressing that I'm have undiagnosed autism or ADHD or something idk. Idk wtf happened. I feel so fucking stupid. I can't believe her coughing is doing this to me.

**1. Texas**  
Texas is where it’s at, man. With cities like Austin and Dallas, you're lookin' at a population that just keeps growing, and they need places to crash. Dive into those zoning laws and keep tabs on infrastructure projects – like that new highway or public transit line – 'cause they can seriously spike property values. Chatting up local agents at meetups could land you that off-market gem.

**2. Arizona**  
Arizona's got a sweet spot with Phoenix and Tucson. There's a ton of new tech companies settling in, so you wanna keep an eye on areas with upcoming developments or transportation improvements. Grab a coffee with local investors or hit up regional real estate conferences to get the lowdown on what's poppin' in the market.

**3. Florida**  
From Miami to Orlando, Florida's more than just beaches and theme parks. The housing market is booming thanks to a growing population and low vacancy rates. Keep your ear to the ground for rental market trends and properties near commercial projects – those could be your golden ticket.

**4. Georgia**  
Atlanta and its 'burbs are heating up! Focus on neighborhoods going thru urban revitalization or gentrification – that's where the magic happens. Hang out with contractors and developers to get early access to properties before they hit the mainstream market.

**5. Tennessee**  
Nashville is buzzing with young professionals, which means housing demand is climbing. Look for areas with new schools or community developments; they're usually indicators of rising property values. And don’t forget those local real estate auctions – you might snag a distressed property that’s ripe for flipping.

**6. North Carolina**  
Between Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina is all about tech growth and universities bringing in new residents. Target properties near these tech hubs for some high appreciation potential. Swing by local chamber of commerce meetings for insider info on future developments.

**7. Colorado**  
Colorado’s not just about mountains and skiing. Denver's job growth and eco-friendly vibe make it a hot investment spot. Check out properties in sustainable developments – buyers love that stuff – and stay in tune with local legislation that might affect real estate trends there.

1il45sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1il45sg/ritalin_is_this_working/,Ritalin - Is This Working?,"So, I just finished my my first day on ritalin, after taking my first dose last night, and I'm still trying to figure out if this is working.   My therapist gave me a quick release pill of 10 miligrams.

He told me to up the dose gradually, up to 20 miligrams ,depending on what dose I most found effective.

**First Dose-**

I broke it in half and took 5 miligrams last night, and felt ok. I was able to work on my thesis for probably about 4 hours straight. Instead of writing something new, though, I got caught up in making clear an insight I suddenly had about a previous section. I think it was a meaningful accomplishment to realize what I realized, but it was also me getting sucked down another rabbit-hole, instead of making real progress on creating a finished product.

**Second Dose-**

I took it this morning before I went to work. I'm a tour guide. I took 10 miligrams in the morning and felt ok. I did seem to be able to keep myself in a flow and rhythm with my speeches, in a way that I don't always achieve.

Apart from being a bit better with my tours, I was also able to be more intentional with my coworkers today, engaging them in conversation in a way that was also more sensitive to their feelings and reactions. I'm still having the same old trouble with maintaining eye-contact, but for whatever reason, possibly a placebo, I was more mindful of looking at them when they spoke.

But I also had a bit of a manic quality to my behavior today. There's a mild euphoria I'm having, a calmness in my body, that I'm worried is just me being high. There's a bit of a vibration in my limbs that you get sometimes during a good high, if anyone knows what I'm taking about.

My stimming has reduced, I didn't rub my hands, or rock my leg, or other things while I was sitting as much, but it hasn't gone away completely. I often have an issue with moving my hands and arms around when I'm giving a tour, to the extent that I sometimes hide them behind my back to let me beat out a rhythm. I didn't have to put my arms behind me today, but I was still moving my arms up and down to emphasize points and accentuate the rhythm in a way that I couldn't completely control.

I'm not sure how much of any of that is the drug, and how much its me wanting the drug to work and so just choosing not to stim.

**Third Dose-**

In the afternoon, I took 20 miligrams, and have had only a slight improvement from the previous dose, though I am a bit more ""stimulated.""

I'm sitting here, after having made myself a tunafish sandwich dinner. I didn't eat all day. I've actually done that many times before at work when we're busy. But today we were slow, and I thought about going to get something to eat, but instead I just sat on a bench and stared at my phone, continuing to tinker with what I did last night on my thesis.

I had a lot of joy doing that, honestly, it felt pretty great at times in a way that was unusual and made me smile. My thesis makes me happy, its the kind of thing I was meant to do, but I don't usually feel that in such a front and center way. I was also just mostly working on the same paragraph, trying to make it work, so it was a bit of a hyper focus.

But that's also the kind of thing that can happen when you're on a stimulant high. I don't have a lot of experience with stimulants. I never did coke, and for some fucking reason never took the adderal that was being passed around in college, so maybe this is something different from that, but I can't tell.

I have a real urge to finally clean my disgusting apartment, while I'm sitting here and writing this, but again, that's also me kind of just wanting this medication to be working.

**I'm So Excited-**

There is also the fact that I'm still very excited to have realized that I have this condition, and how thrilled I am to be taking medication to finally treat it. I'm happy just having the bottle.

I'm sure plenty of you can relate. Everything about my life suddenly makes so much more sense. What makes that so much more meaningful, is that there's something I can do about it.

That itself might be making it a bit hard to calm down. I got into a bit of a fight and had a real emotional reaction (emotional dysregulation) with my pharmacy when they were a couple days late in filling the prescription, they might think I'm a drug addict.

I've had such a reevaluation of so many things since my shrink explained the condition more to me. It only took two sessions for them to convince me I had it, and they really only had to suggest it, and explain that it wasn't always associated with hyperactivity. Since then, I've had so many eureka moments, tracing whfat I thought were just oddities about myself, or failings, and realizing it was ADHD all along. I'm sure plenty of other people in this subreddit know, its hard to even express how dramatically your perspective can change after realizing you have this.

Its only been a month.

I know why I say ""what"" when people talk to me now. I know why I destroyed so many chairs growing up. I know why I can only write and do work when I'm in a public place. I know why I struggled so much with waking up when I was younger. I know why I now set alarms an hour ahead of when I need to wake up.

I've tried to deny it, of course, but deep down, I always thought I was just lazy, or lacked will power. This changes everything.

**What I Haven't Had Yet-**

But, I don't have the sudden clarity yet that others have reported, and that I was REALLY HOPING FOR, of my mind calming down, and suddenly being able to be more present. At least, I don't think I do. I haven't had a chance yet to do something like sit down in a coffee shop to see if anything feels different. My work has a lot of chaos and things to keep me stimulated, in a way that works for my ADHD, so I also haven't necessarily had a chance yet to see if I can allow my mind to calm down.

I've been half-listening to a youtube video as I wrote all this, there's still the need to distract myself, or keep my brain extra-occupied, or whatever causes me to do things like that.

If you're one of the unfortunate people who read some or most of this, you can probably tell I'm still having a bit of manic reaction, though its calmed as I wrote this. I did just take my fourth dose, an hour ago, when I got home.

I am on another medication, a pretty heavy dose of pregabalin, 600 miligrams a day, for anxiety. So that also probably has something to do with why I'm maybe feeling a bit high. I've been on it for a month, but the effects of relaxation are probably coming through in a way they weren't before. That could explain the manic reaction. I've had that to an extent before. Pregabalin stops your brain from producing a certain fear chemical, so just having that suddenly removed can create a bit of a wild feeling if you're someone who has anxiety, your grip is suddenly loosened.

**TLDR-** I'm not really sure how to sort out what's a placebo effect, and what's just normal drug stimulation, and what's me actually getting help with my adhd. I'm just wondering if anyone can help me sort out some of these feelings and sensations.

I'm going to get up now, and see if I still want to clean my apartment. I may provide an update.",1,1739067181.0,mentalillness,0,1.0,False

Alright, let’s break this down. **You’re a wide eyed first year lawyer at Chase Bank**, handling **Joe’s Coffee default disaster**, and suddenly—boom! You realize **you can’t touch a key asset** because of a sneaky little rule called **BIOC (Buyer in Ordinary Course of Business).**

# 🚨 THE BIOC RULE: HOW IT SCREWS LENDERS 🚨

🔥 **High-Scoring Rule Statement:**

""A Buyer in Ordinary Course of Business (BIOC) takes goods free of a security interest created by their seller, even if the security interest is perfected, unless the buyer knew the sale violated the secured party’s rights""

🚨 **Translation:** If Joe **sells his espresso machines, coffee beans, or merch** to a **normal, unsuspecting customer** → **That customer takes free and clear**. Chase **CAN’T** repo the machine from the buyer.

**The bank is just SOL** (S\*\*\* Outta Luck).

# ☕ BIOC vs. Chase: How Joe Screws the Bank (Legally)

🚀 **Scenario:**

* Chase **loans Joe $50,000** and takes a **security interest in his inventory and equipment**.
* Joe **sells an espresso machine** to **a local café owner** who just walked in to buy one.
* That café owner is a **BIOC** → **They take it free of Chase’s security interest**.
* **Chase can’t take it back. Period.**

🤯 **Why?!**  
Because the café owner **bought it in the ordinary course of Joe’s business**—buying espresso machines **from a coffee supplier isn’t weird**.

# 🔥 THE RULE IN SIMPLE TERMS:

✅ **BIOC Must:**  
✔️ Buy in **good faith** and **without knowing** it’s collateralized.  
✔️ Buy in the **ordinary course** of the seller’s business.  
✔️ Buy from someone **in the business of selling that type of good**.

🚨 **Who’s NOT a BIOC?**  
❌ Someone who knows the seller **isn’t supposed to be selling the item** (e.g., Joe’s landlord buys an espresso machine **for dirt cheap** after Joe tells him Chase is after him).  
❌ Someone buying **outside normal business operations** (e.g., Joe sells his **entire shop** to a random friend).

# 😡 HOW CHASE CAN PROTECT ITSELF (IF IT’S SMART)

BIOC can make **secured lenders cry**, but **banks do have defenses**:

1️⃣ **Loan Smart** → Only lend against stuff Joe **won’t sell in the ordinary course** (like his **business equipment, not his coffee beans**).  
2️⃣ **File Against Proceeds** → If Chase can’t get the espresso machine back, it can **claim the cash Joe got from the sale** (but **only if it acts within 20 days**).  
3️⃣ **Floorplan Financing** → If Chase **knows Joe is reselling**, they should use **a special lending structure** (used in car dealerships).

# 🤯 REALITY CHECK: SO, BANKS JUST LOSE?!

🚨 **Yes, but only sometimes.**

If a **buyer in the ordinary course gets the goods** → **The bank eats the loss**.  
If the buyer is **NOT in the ordinary course** → **The bank can seize the goods**.

🔥 **BOTTOM LINE:** BIOC protects **innocent buyers** so they don’t have to **worry about banks showing up to repo their stuff.** Banks know this and **price it into their loans** (aka **higher interest rates**).

# 🏆 FINAL TAKEAWAY 

✔️ **BIOC takes free of the security interest** → Chase **loses the goods** but might still claim **proceeds**.  
✔️ **Chase can’t seize from an innocent buyer**, but it **can grab cash from Joe** (if it moves fast).  
✔️ **Banks should structure their loans smartly** to avoid losing everything to BIOC rules.

🔥 **Now go tell your Chase boss why BIOC just cost them a fancy espresso machine.** ☕💸",3,1739067051.0,GoatBarPrep,0,0.8,False

Yes, I know, fresh beans and single wall filter baskets are better. I’m just practicing and wanted to avoid throwing out some coffee, but I’m at a loss.

Every time I pull a double shot, a thin and aggressive stream comes out, I feel like it pulls for 10 seconds (though I think I get 30 grams per 15 grams of ground coffee — the coffee scale I got is shit and i’m upgrading) and the shots taste super acidic. This is with a bottomless filter— when I use the spouted filter it comes with the Bambino plus, it only comes out the one spout.

I tried this with 3 different bags of pre-ground coffee, playing with the weight on each of them to fit the basket, so I don’t think it’s a matter of weight. I’ve also tried reprogramming the shot volume but no dice.

I’m using a normcore WDT and tamper, and the razor that comes with the Breville Bambino Plus.

This may be a bit long, but I want to make sure you get to know me before you say hi. I have not included pictures because I do not feel comfortable posting my face on here, but will be happy to send some via a DM or chat!

About me: 
-32F, sterilized since 2018
-based in the Southwestern US. 5'3"", very small build. 
-I am seeking my forever partner and would like to get married one day. 
-I drink only a few times a year, never smoke or do any other kind of drug besides an extremely small amount of CBD gummies once a week.
- Cat owner.
- Politically left.
- I work remotely and am good at long distance relationships as I text back quickly. I  would want to settle somewhere together someday. Open to male partners in North America.

One friend referred to me as ""a shot of bourbon followed by a bottle of Mexicoke"". Another described me as ""death metal exterior, soft squishy ocean interior"". I am an introvert but am very loud around small groups of people know. 

I am an active outdoor human.  I train with a long distance running group four days a week, and I lift and do core work at least twice a week for injury prevention.  I am learning to longboard. In the past I have skiied and climbed and want to pick both up again.  I would like a partner who is as active as I am, although we don't have to have the same preferred sports or trained together. I do need someone who respects this lifestyle and will cheer me on at races (and I would do the same for you!). I primarily road run but I am doing more and more trail running.

I am a long distance backpacker closing in on 3000 miles of trail - thrued the AT and Tahoe Rim, am sectioning the AZT and got a big chunk of the CT done. A Triple Crown and Little Tiara is likely in my future. Being comfortable spending several nights in the backcountry in the tent is also a must for my partner. When I travel it is almost always to backpack, and I am a ""spend two weeks in the backcountry of a national park"" person not ""hit up three cities in four days"" person. I would love to have a partner who wants to thruhike or bikepack trails together, but it is not required.

I'm a writer with two Masters. I would love a partner who is able to read my work and support me on this journey. I journal all the time, handwrite my first drafts and love fountain pens and stationery.

 I also knit and would love to start making pottery. Music tastes are prog rock, folk, punk, lofi, ambient, some metal, and old country, but I haven't been to a concert a decade.

 When I am not outside, I enjoy reading and writing in coffee shops, attending book or poetry readings or other talks about science and nature. When I am with my friends and we are not training or hiking together, I like to organize cook book clubs, potlucks, pool parties, and clothing swaps.

I am a practicing scientific pagan witch. I read Tarot and birth charts, do spells and rituals on the sabbats/esbats, and have a full altar and a lot of candles and bones in my house. However I also believe in vaccines and modern medicine, and am deeply interested in the natural sciences, and base my practices around this. I believe that scientific knowledge is the way we can truly know how magical our world is. I am deeply rooted in a sense of place. I am not indigenous, but the melding of indigenous knowledge and Western science that is talked about in Braiding Sweetgrass and Of Wolves and Men is the path I am trying to walk. I am trying to learn how to hunt, fish, and grow things in order to connect with this world more deeply (teach me, please!). I am trying to cultivate a deep sense of place that is often lost in today's world.

I don't support woo-woo spiritual grifting, ahistorical goo, or the reduction of witchcraft to cutesy rituals or celebrity worship that serves capitalism. I am not into spooky stuff or horror.

I am an Aquarius Sun, Moon and stellium with Capricorn Rising and I have Venus in Pisces in the 2nd house. IYKYK.

About you: 
-27 - 40M based in North America.
- Enjoys being active and exploring the outdoors. -Comfortable and experienced in the backcountry-- you don't have to be a thru-hiker, but you need to be okay with sleeping in a tent.
- Doesn't smoke.
-Is also a driven person.
-Likes cats
- Emotionally available, in touch with your sensitive side, comfortable opening up and can communicate well. The best men are the ones who tell their bros they love them, and also cried recently. None of us are perfect, including yours truly, but I am hoping you are working towards being a better version of yourself. I am doing the same.
- Know what you want out of both relationships and your life - I would hope you are as certain about these things as you are about being CF! -Have a strong connection to your friends and family, blood, chosen, or otherwise.

Bonus points, but not required if you : 

-Live in a rural area surrounded by boreal forest.
-Love to cook - I am a mediocre one, if enthusiastic. 
- Have a strong knowledge of the natural world.

Deal breakers:
- Right wing folx need not apply.

-If you are not sure what you want out of a relationship, are not sure if you are ready to date, or are not interested in marriage someday, we are not a good fit. I am not rushing to settle, and move slowly in relationships, but I would like a husband someday, and prefer to date people who also know what they want.

- If your hobbies and free time completely revolve around screens, video games, pop culture, anime, or going to Comic Con.  I find it hard to bond over shared pop culture fandoms, playing a video game or watching a new show together. I barely use social media.

Thank you so much for reading. Excited to meet and talk with you. I hope we all find who we are looking for. Be well and blessed be.

Did my first body comp measurements, need help determining best way forward","Tagging this question for the community as it’s a mix of nutrition and workout but also just general confusion about the process / help needed. Up until now it’s been just - eat healthy regularly and dance. It’s worked well but now I’d like to understand more about health and fitness and take it more seriously. 

F33 5’6 59kg

I did my first body composition measurements today (see pic). I want to decrease my weight to 54kg, whilst decreasing body fat to 21%, ideally maintaining or building muscle if possible. I was told it would be difficult to both lose weight and also decrease body fat percentage with my stats.

If I could also increase my bmr (to what I’m not sure?!?!), hydration percentage to 60, and bone mass to 2.6kg, while decreasing my metabolic age to 30 and visceral fat to 1, that would be great. 

Currently my diet could be better and more regular and I don’t keep a food diary / track of what I eat. I mostly have coffee for breakfast, some chicken and veg for lunch and fish and veg for dinner, sometimes with rice. Not much carbs but I do have a sweet tooth and will typically eat chocolate in the eve. I drink about 40g of protein water per day.

I dance 3 days a week at varying levels of intensity for at least an hour, walk for 1.5-2 hours at around 90bpm 3 days a week, do a hiit cycle once a week for 30 mins, and do an hour of fairly gentle yoga at least 3 days a week, but often 6. I want to incorporate more strength based training 3 times a week. Currently I don’t have a fitness watch to track the exact amount of calories, heart rate etc 

Aesthetically I have huge broad shoulders so I want to focus less on them, leaning out my back arms legs and abdomen and increasing my glutes and hips.

Any advice on if it is possible to reach my goals and if so the best diet and workout plan to get there (or just general ideas of what should be included; food groups, when and how often to eat, how frequently to exercise, how hard/heavy to take it, timelines etc) greatly appreciated

First of all, I'm assuming you're actually living in an area for >1 month, not waddling around like a neanderthal looking for his/her next cave. And if so, you are struggling to make friends, just a tip that's worked for me in building community: go to your local bar, the same bar, not the touristy one in the center, a couple times a week. You can say this about any activity, yes, but the bar remains a social hub for many communities etc. Also, an assumption I have is that you're in somewhere somewhat big (think: cities) - not a small village in Kosovo 😁  
  
**What if you don't drink?** Don't drink then. Get the N/A beer or just nurse that mofo. Go to some of the shows, oyster pop-ups, fudgin hand painting and wine. 

**What bar do I go to?** Probably not the old, rustic cafes in Nice with old men drinking the house wine and chainsmoking (these are fun bars, but you're prolly not gonna make friends). Pick natural wine bars, bars in hip areas with young folks, bars/art shows in the art districts. There is an *art* to picking the bar - you'll need to hone it. You'll want to find the sweet balance between expats/other people that travel a bit and locals, and the harmonious mixture of those two groups. You'll notice I said ""natural wine bar"" in this paragraph -  my pitch for this is usually where fun cosmpolitan yuppies find themselves in a city. But you can also go to punk shows in Merida, or coffee shops in Amsterdam O:). Go where your vibe is

**Ok I'm here, how do I make friends?** Hehe. It's okay if you're not the ""Hey my name is \_\_\_\_. Tell me about \_\_\_\_"" type. You can do two things, either sit near the bartender, the universal sign that you're fiending for a chat, or just bring a book. Give it some time and just chill. Ask questions, order some food, randomly buy the other person alone a drink.  
  
Mainly making this post as a support to those who feel lonely as they travel in the great unknown.

Like I made it through 2024 with only one episode. Other times I can have them once a month like in 2023. I have little to no memories of that years because I had a episode every month. I was only awake for two weeks each month. It's not like ""oh I'm tired I'll just drink some coffee"", once the episode hits there's no staying awake no matter how much caffeine I drink. Everyone says I'm being overdramatic and that it's normal. No it's not! Episodes like that are not normal but no one listens to me because of my age. It bothers me that I'm being ignored. Like it could be something serious and no one will know ",5,1739066004.0,ChronicIllness,2,1.0,False

Sims taking care of their own need to sleep will very often refuse to sleep, instead making cups of coffee to sustain themselves. If you don't command them to use a bed, they'll just crash right on the floor.

Their need to eat is sated most often by foods that take very little preparation, effort, or ingredients. A Sim would rather eat a bag of potato chips than cook a meal, and if they do cook, it's something like salad or grilled cheese.

Taking care of their clothing and their cleanliness? Uncommon. Sims won't often feel any urge to shower or change their clothes even if it's actively making them uncomfortable.

When they need entertainment, Sims will often turn to unproductive and simple means, like a TV or a computer.

The only thing they seem good at doing is using the bathroom, but even then, it's not rare for a Sim to put their toilet priority so low that they'll up and pee themselves.",25,1739065752.0,LowStakesConspiracies,1,1.0,False

I got a BiPAP for severe (SEVERE) sleep apnea, it was a 6 month process and I viewed that as the first step. I set non negotiables…bringing lunch to work every day, transitioned that to eating light for breakfast with coffee and committing to cutting out McDonald’s first and then more fast food (whatever I like Taco Bell’s soft taco and del tacos street tacos with guac they’re 200ish cals and indulge probably once every week or so…like today 🤪). 

We switched insurance at work going into 24 and had a weight loss rider, I took the bump to get the shot, first one I got was 12/26/23. I went through a LOT of insanity with blue cross and getting PAs and only was able to get it 6 more times throughout the year. 

Committed along the way to getting more active and have sporadically posted on this sub. I lost the weight loss rider this year and idk if I’ll be able to get coverage for it for the OSA (that I don’t suffer from now). 

Im down 153ish lbs. My goal weight at inception was 249lbs by my 35th bday (5 weeks away currently) and I’m currently 13ish pounds away. 

My bp at the start was off the charts, truly insane…went in for physical I’m currently 112/70.

My resting hr sits around 60-65.

I am and I feel exceptionally healthy right now…close to as good as I did when I did CrossFit for a couple years and was hovering around 210-215. Im so I’ve never been a small guy. 

I got a new compound that I’m going to try out for a little bit but I wanted to come here and hope to push somebody else a little further along today.  

I might be stuck with a little pouch on my stomach but I weighed 416lbs at my biggest I saw on a scale and I’m sure it was bigger than that at times.

Firstly, I'm fairly sure my old 2006 model is compatible, but their site suggests it might not be. I have emailed them about that but no reply yet, maybe because it's the weekend. Anyway, looking at it, It's about $140 + shipping half way round the world for their kit. Looking around online, I can buy the controller, two SSRs and a temperature probe ([something like this](https://img.lazcdn.com/g/p/07c9219e822f3c3583cda00e78c1267b.jpg_2200x2200q80.jpg_.webp)) locally for half that amount, this just leaves the wiring.

Now, I'm an electrical/electronic engineer, done my share of panel wiring int he past. I have the relevant tools and a bunch of terminals (but not the ones that connect to the boiler, anyone know what they are?) I have a bunch of high temperature silicon wire left over from when I partially rewired my oven after rats got in. Pretty sure I got this.

One other thing, I was looking at [this post](https://kabalin.blogspot.com/2014/03/gaggia-classic-controlling-temperature.html), but the steam temperature here depends on the original bimetal thermostat. I've read about using the alarm output for the steam temperature. I've seen circuit diagrams using two SSRs, but their outputs are in parallel. How is the steam switch wired in this case?

Am I stuck in dead end lab jobs?,"Did my BS in Microbiology with a minor in Plant Breeding and Biotech and finished that off in 2022. My degree was in micro, but ny coursework was beyond my core micro classes was almost entirely in environmental sciences. Had a real terrible time applying for jobs. I was only getting callbacks from factories so I tried that out for a month and was completely miserable working swing shifts and constantly overstimulated by all the noises. I had a more agricultural molecular bio based role lined up that got cancelled due to money issues. So I took the trad advice in my field which was to do grad school. I was accepted to a funded MS in a well known school and told I could do work related to agriculture. Once I moved to this city, that offer was rescinded and I was stuck joining a lab that studied biomedical topics. 

Issue is that I don't have the coursework necessary to understand that field. So I was always playing catch up. I never even cared about the topic I studied, which made me resent the process of playing catch up even more. I didn't make any friends. I felt completely alone and isolated. I hated the competitive nature of it all and found all the labs I encountered to be toxic. I would have never finished my BS if I knew getting an agriculture biotech role would be so challenging. The only job roles I am seeing are doing biomedical related work and I am just genuinely not interested in this field. I kept applying to environmental jobs through most my MS, hoping I would find something and be able to drop out, but that day never came. I finished in May 2024

I am still applying to environmental science jobs, food scientist, technical writing, patent examiner, government jobs (state, local, and fed), project manager or coordinator, sales, cannabis industry, and business development roles.Nothing is panning out and the only times I even get interviews is if I apply to biomedical university research or pharma labs. I know many people relocate, but I do not feel like I am at all in a place to do that, nor would I want to do it for a field I don't even like. My health is also not great so having ease of access to nice facilities now has become important to me.  I would rather leave lab work altogether than be stuck in this kind of culture. I just don't know how to get around this or what I can do at this point. I've even been rejected at coffee shops, restaurants, and retail stores. No temp agencies around me could ""find appropriate placement"", the career counselors were stumped, and my state employment office told me to go back to school. 

So what types of roles would be obtainable for someone if their entire work history is all lab jobs? Is it even possible to piviot afrer 6 years? Every time I find a real person to talk to on LinkedIn they just keep telling me to give labs another try, but I have struggled in each lab I've worked in and feel like I desperately need a change.

1il30u1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1il30u1/my_best_friend_25f_tried_to_kill_herself_after_i/,My best friend (25f) tried to kill herself after I (25f) went on a date (27m),"For quick context: I've known my friend  (25f) since highschool. We were in different classes but for some reason she developed a crush on me. She asked me out and I rejected her, and she was surprisingly cool with it which made me respect her a lot. We became friends. During these last 5 years we have grown a lot closer and she has become someone that I trust heavily and rely on. We talked recently about a relationship between us two and agreed that we want different things.

Now, these past 4 months I've grown closer with a guy I used to work with (27m). We've hung out a couple of times, watched series and gone out for coffee, and last week we went out on a proper ""date"" I'd say.

I kept this ""date"" from my friend up until the day it was going to happen. I was planning on not telling her at all but my nerves faltered and I just needed to text someone to de-stress before it happened. Immediately she started talking about killing herself. I felt stuck in a weird position because I knew I could only talk to her for a while until I had to leave for the date. I tried my best to distract her with more easy-going topics and trying to get her to go talk with her family or other friends. I felt sick the entire date with guilt and stressing that she was going to hurt herself. She has cut herself before and I don't want her to get worse.

After the date I contacted her again and another friend had talked with her. She was okay and she talked about how she knows she was being ""irrational"".

This has happened once before long ago when we complained about her dating profile. In the moment I made one myself because I too was sick of being single and she got really depressed. She spiraled and ended up talking about how she was going to kill herself.

Usually whenever I bring up the topic of crushes or people I find attractive she  gets a bit depressed or hostile. I know it's mostly from a self-preservation point, but the fact that I've told her repeatedly that I only and WILL only see her as a friend and she ends up getting territorial frustrates me.

She doesn't want to introduce me to her friends because she's scared they're going to ""leave"" her for me. At the same time she hates when I hang out with other people because she feels like I'm going to ""leave"" her for them. 

I feel like I'm trapped and I don't know what to do. I feel guilty talking to new people and not giving her attention, and I feel lonely not having someone I can fully express myself to.

I haven't been able to respond to the guy I met up with for a week because I know he wants to meet up again (I do too) but I feel so bad having to keep this from my best friend. The thought of responding makes me want to throw up. If it ends up becoming something long-term I cant keep it from her. If I dont see him again and isolate myself I feel like I will be trapped in solitude forever.

Tl;dr Best friend (25f) asked me out before and got rejected. She is okay with it but doesn't like it when I mention interest in other people. I'm seeing an ex-coworker (27m) and went on a date with him. I told my friend and she spiraled. The guilt makes me feel ill and is affecting the way I approach other people.

I have severe social phobia and don't have any other friends I trust to be my true self with.

On your back from class, you’ll finally build the courage to tell her those feelings you feel deep in your heart. Those feelings you write about every day, wishing you could scream from a mountaintop for the world to hear just how madly in love you are with this girl. But when you finally do build the courage to do so, she’ll look at you, not scared or worried but disappointed. And she’s not disappointed in you but herself because she just isn’t ready for a relationship. And you’ll have no other choice but to accept this. You can ask her, “Can we still be friends?” And after a long pause, she’ll nod and say of course. But tomorrow in class,  she’ll be on the other side of the room, sitting on her phone with her leg shaking as she looks out of the corner of her eye, making sure you don’t walk over to her. And you won’t wanna cause a scene, so you’ll sit in your normal seat and try your absolute hardest not to look at her, but god, god, you don’t want to look at anything else besides her perfect blue eyes and her golden hair. But you can’t anymore because you’re just friends. Now, she’ll stop texting you because she’s just really busy. You’ll eventually find a new girl to call your lover, but secretly, or not so secretly, you will hate this girl. You will resent her every day because she is not who you desire. One day, before you graduate, you’ll run into your “friend” at the campus coffee shop, and she’ll be so excited to finally see you and she gives you a hug. A rush of emotions takes over you as everything she says goes over your head except one phrase. Your old “friend” asks if you’re single, because now, now she’s ready for a relationship. It’s been two years, but she’s finally ready. And instead of jumping at the opportunity, instead of leaving your unhealthy, resentful relationship, you tear into your old “friend.” You call her nasty, mean words so she can feel how you felt when she told you, “We’re still friends.” As you walk away, you turn and see her crying, and now you realize. Everything you ever wanted was just burned like the library of Alexandria. But, you move on. Your girlfriend, who you love to resent, has your daughter. You name her after your old “friend” because her eyes match hers. But now you start to hate your daughter. Your child! Because she isn’t your old “friend's” daughter. Now, you hate everything in life. You hate your job, which pays you 6 figures. You hate your beautiful house on the water. You hate your friends. Because they aren’t your old “friend.” Now, until they bury you 6 feet deep, you walk into every coffee shop reminded of the words you told the girl you wish you loved. Eventually, you lie on your deathbed. Still resenting every aspect of your life. As you fade, she appears, and finally, she takes your hand and guides you away.

I do like the eye stuff and a few Products but I’m all over the place and can’t be loyal to any brand. 
This is just me sharing a story even if you hate MK. 

I just want to randomly make this post for some reason maybe it’s too late for us, but not our daughters :) 
I’m 49. Ex smoker. I can’t be counted because I e suffered with horrible breakouts my whole life, accutane in the past(it was life changing amazing ), I’ve had deep peels & Botox etc. This just means whatever I do or don’t do doesn’t count for what I currently look like. 

I have high school friends that are beautiful souls and people . Healthy and athletic. I just know they aren’t the type to be worrying about skincare over the years. I see them on Facebook and it’s evident they don’t manage their aging (because they are beautiful anyway and it’s all good ) and I’ve noticed up close selfies with severe wrinkles. (And that’s okay) 
I have daughters in their 20s who are getting into long term skincare routines. Always asking me etc. 
I can only say my mom is 75 and has been cutting the vitamin E capsules and using the thick vitamin E around her eyes my whole life. Her eyes are amazing. Shockingly amazing. I’ve done it o er the years and now have commited to the capsules myself and use vitamin E oil to remove mascara.
That’s the best advice I have for them, with the exception of one of my life long best friends. 
She’s healthy, never had acne or any major skin issues, but she looks so fantastic. Over coffee I look at her and can’t believe her skin. 
She has been using Mary Kay exclusively since we were 20 years old. 
Makeup AND the time wise skincare line. 
Drinks lots of water but she isn’t perfect . Shes been in the sun for sport parenting over the years, used to smoke pot, has occasional drinks. But she has never been a flawless genetic person. 
It’s her routine. 
Sorry for long story. My girls asked what she does. I knew she’s always used it even when we could barely afford it, so I confirmed with her to relay to them. They are all switching to Mary Kay. 30 years of using Mary Kay and comparing her skin aging to our peers is wild. 
That’s all. :) if you don’t switch, at least tell your girls in your life. She’s a walking billboard for Mary Kay. 
Edit. 
My friend doesn’t look young, her skin just looks amazing compared to our peers. Also, it’s not really a debate. I was just sharing 2 things that seemed to have worked over decades of 2 women I know. 
It’s okay if you don’t do it or believe it ! I was just sharing.

anyways, for context, i live in the second biggest suburb in my town. it’s so huge and houses multiple “mini-neighborhoods” (we call them villages) and it takes 3 whole minutes just to drive from my village to the entrances and exits of the actual neighborhood. last i checked, it takes over 30 minutes to walk to the entrance.

needless to say, i don’t go out much unless it’s for school. i am so fucking depressed about it. i can’t go visit my friends, the local restaurants and convenience stores that are BUILT into our neighborhood take half an hour to get to and i have POTs. i can’t walk that far without passing out. i have to drive everywhere but i only have my permit so i rely on adults to be in the car with me if i want to go places. when i am depressed, people tell me “just go outside !!” and do what ?? stare at all the houses and boring sidewalk ?? all of the houses look the same, the sidewalks look so depressing. when i went to NYC for two days, i was in paradise. it was a lot of walking, but everywhere i looked, there was a new building with a new shape and on top of that, coffee shops, grocery stores, beauty stores, clothing stores, etc. were right next to nearly EVERY apartment, including the one we stayed at. i loved it and i was so sad to leave. i’m just so tired of staying indoors all the time and not having a place to go to that’s not school or home and being stuck in this boring, understimulating suburb. sorry for the rant.

1il2sm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/blendedfamilies/comments/1il2sm7/my_husbands_ex_keeps_calling_and_hanging_out_when/,My husbands ex keeps calling and hanging out when I'm on night shift,"Me '36F' and my husband '40M'  we have been together 7 year, married 2. We have 1 child between us. A toddler. I also have 1 teen. And he has 4 teens to his ex. We have been together 8
7 years. 

For context, the first 4 years of our relationship was turbulent due to his ex(lets call her sarah).  I was not the other woman. They were broke up for years prior to him meeting me. But with kids involved it was not pretty and ALOT of court involvement. 

When me and husband got married, sarah '37F' came to me and asked could we start over. She acknowledged that her children loved me and that I treated them well and that she wanted their enviroment to be secure and happy. She apologised for her prior behaviour towards me, and honestly I get it. I heard her out and understand she was going through a tough time. I accepted her proposal, and over the past two years, me and her have realised that we are so alike. We have the same hobbies,  interests etc. Since me, sarah and my husband have all started communicating better, we have created a secure, safe enviroment for all our children. All 6. We do families days out, holidays and school events. Me and Sarah actually go to the gym together and coffee dates and bring the kids out. Having me also mediate between Sarah and my husband on matters regarding the children has also helped prevent fights. (Sarah and my husband don't communicate as well as me and husband does)

My issues is that every time I go to work , Sarah has started calling and hanging out in my home with my husband for hours and i don't know how to feel about it. 

For more context. Me and husband work back to back night shifts,  so that someone is always at home with our toddler. On those nights I'm working, it is his contract time with his children with Sarah. So they all stay in ours. (The older ones pick and close when they stay. But the 12 year old always stays at least. The children also come and stay other nights out of the week when I'm home,  so it's just not my husbands contracted time.) 

But on his contract time, when I'm away for the night, Sarah always calls and stays for 2-5 hours. Usually from 7pm to midnight. 

She will say one the kids needs something for school the next morning (which is probably true) but she will be there for hours on end. Ive a ring camera. I see. 

My husband says she calls and talks the ear of him and he doesnt know how to be rude and tell her to leave (honestly he is a push over that way) he says the kids are  walking about the house and nothing is happening for me to worry about, but also that he understands and that he doesnt want me to be uncomfortable.  

He wants to approach her and tell her it's creating atmosphere between me and him. And that hanging out for hours on end is not respectful to me in my home, every single night I'm working night shift. 

But i can't help feeling like I'm creating drama being upset at this and asking her to stop.  I honestly appreciate her friendship and the raising of all these children so I don't want to lose that. I also think she doesnt have much family support either and leans on us, which is fine. I will be that for her... but im struggling with this aspect and unsure if my worry is validated.   how can I or my husband tell her it's not appropriate to be calling and staying like that? 

Or is it normal behaviour and am I over reacting?",5,1739062976.0,blendedfamilies,14,0.86,False

1il2r96,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreCervicalCancer/comments/1il2r96/positive_leep_experience/,Positive LEEP Experience,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to share my experience because this subreddit has given me a lot of information and support during this process and I would like to add to that for others. 

I had my LEEP with GA on January 22, 2025, and prior to that I was told that it would be an in office procedure and that GA or numbing was not an option. However, someone recommended to me that I message my gyno and request “conscious sedation” and those were the magical words. She reached out to my insurance (BCBS) and they approved coverage at 80%. 

The LEEP went well and my gyno took three samples. One from above my cervical canal, one over it, and one below it. My top and bottom samples showed CIN2 with negative margins. Unfortunately the center sample showed CIN2 without negative margins meaning I will have to go back for a colposcopy in six months to investigate. I’m disappointed but the procedure and healing process have not been bad at all so I am thankful for that. 

In terms of recovery, I was expecting a lot of discharge, bleeding and a smell. I haven’t had any of that. I had some orange (betadine?) goop come out over day 1-3, otherwise I have had almost no discharge. There was one day where I had very minimal “coffee ground” stuff in my discharge but I only knew what it was from reading these posts. Cramping was minimal and I haven’t been too moody. There was one day I was definitely feeling sad and I just stayed in and cuddled my dog. Otherwise, I was out and about going grocery shopping, archery lessons, even had a date! So, while I understand there is a lot of women who suffer greatly throughout this process, I wanted to voice an experience that wasn’t so bad!

I ended up paying about $1.8k out of pocket and will update if I receive any other bills, but I think that might be it!

I hope this soothes the worries of anyone going through this process. It’s no fun at all and I am happy to answer any questions people may have. ",5,1739062869.0,PreCervicalCancer,1,1.0,False

It’s my first time posting and I wanna talk about something weird that happened to me with a coworker. I want to apologize for my bad English grammar since it’s not my first language. I’m not sure if I will leave it up for long, depending on if it makes me uncomfortable later. Please be kind to my weird situation I’m new to such things.

So I visited a coworker who is an elder guy we are on friendly terms and we get along well he invited me for coffee but unfortunately only had time in the evening and I didn’t mind. I drove to his place and we got to chatting when we put on a movie, while watching it he said I should make myself comfortable and that I can put my legs wherever I want. That’s when he also said he can massage them for me and I kind of didn’t mind so he did and that’s when I noticed there might be more behind it but I kind of didn’t want to see it that way? I’m not sure what I thought it in that moment I felt very save and secure and maybe I was too naive. I thought because he had a wife that he could never possibly want something from me in that way but with each passing moment he got closer and more touchy with me. I kind of felt bad to say something maybe it was part of my people pleasing side? Part of me also enjoyed it being held and touched that way but I also felt guilty. Not only because he has a wife but I myself am in a relationship (long distance) I don’t why I couldn’t bring myself to tell him he’s getting to close to me he even gave me a kiss on the cheek but I didn’t react he just cuddled up to me. I hate to say it but he was so charming and gentle I never had a man be like that he knew exactly how to wrap me around his finger. Ugh I hate so much about what happened I also hate the part of me that enjoyed it and I hate the part of me that held back and didn’t tell him to stop. I also feel like I gave him mixed signals not complaint about the way he touched me, glancing over to him and him glancing back. I don’t know what had gotten into me I was just so confused of how to feel about this situation. Now writing this down I don’t know what I’m expecting off Reddit maybe some advice? Maybe someone can explain to me my feelings or sort things since I still am a bit off a mess…
I will definitely see him at work again.
My long distance partner knows what happened.
I feel guilty still since I didn’t go into detail to my partner. I also felt guilty since this man has a wife. How could he do this to her while she’s working night shifts. Originally I thought she would be there too but she wasn’t.
I can’t stop thinking about the way how gentle he was to me and where he touched me.

Would you clock in one last time, knowing there’d be no paycheck, no future, no tomorrow waiting on the other side? Would you turn on the lights, fly the planes, serve the coffee, file the reports, not because it would change anything, but because, for a few more hours, it might make the world feel normal?

It’s the age-old question: would you be the one to run into the burning building to save someone? Would it matter if they were a stranger or a loved one?

But now, the fire is everywhere. Tomorrow doesn’t exist. There is no hero, no villain, no miracle, just the quiet certainty that the world will simply end. And there is nothing you can do to stop it.

So what do you do?

Some will go home. They will hold their loved ones close, whispering words they should have said long ago. Some will finally break free, chasing the things they always feared to lose. Others will sit in silence, watching the sun rise and fall for the last time. And yes, there will be those who fight, who rage against the inevitable, as if somewhere, somehow, an answer still exists.

But then, there will be the helpers.

The ones who show up.

Not because they have to. Not because it will change anything. But because someone, somewhere, will find comfort in the world turning one last time.

The doctors and nurses who stay at their posts, not to save lives, but to ease the way out. The power plant workers who keep the lights on, so families can spend their last moments in warmth. The pilots who take one final flight, and the flight attendants who still serve drinks and smiles, bringing people home for their final goodbyes.

I think that, in those final hours, we would see humanity at both its worst and its absolute best. Some people would act selfishly, but many would show kindness beyond words, making the most selfless choices of their lives, knowing they wouldn’t even be around to see their impact. 

The last day of the world would be the most human day ever lived.

(DESPERATE for some advice).,"Im reposting this becuase I really want outsiders point of view. One of my roommates thinks Im in the wrong but what happened today but here we go. This is my first time really ranting about this. Im will give many details so maybe my roommates will see this. I really hope they don't through. I really need advice on this like PLEASE read if you have the time. Im desperate.

The simple rundown: I constantly clean up after everyone and buy almost all the extra appliances, dishes, cookware, utensils, and more. I try to be there for them even when they are not there for me. I'll explain almost everything in this post. Maybe it is immature of me to post this on reddit, but I've already talked to them about everything many times.

Im in university and live in a four-bedroom apartment with three other people. I am a girl and I live with one other girl and two guys. The girl and I were desperate to find roommates to live in this certain apartment complex and we already knew one of the guys and he brought his best friend along. Ill call the girl roommate Sarah and the two guys Ben and Ethan. Sarah and I were roommates our previous year of University. We are all sophomores now. I have discussed Everything I wrote here with the girl roommate I live with, but honestly, it feels like she dismissed the boys behavior constantly and tells me ""Thats how men are"". 

Three of us are full time students except for Ben who works full time at a smoke shop. I am in 2 University Clubs and work for a magazine. Sarah works 3 nights a week and Ethan works random school jobs. I bring this up so you can get context of how busy we all are. 

Everything was okay until I realized I was always cleaning after everyone. For context, I had bought all the cookware, including pots, pans, and cooking utensils, as well as the silverware and dishes. Our swifter, broom, and vacuum are also mine. I did not mind buying everything at first because I would still own those items later in life when I moved out.

I realized that I have been cleaning after EVERYONE. Many times, dishes would be left over. And I admit, I am not the best person at dishes, so many times; I would just clean everything in the sink or that has piled over because, YES, I am also guilty. However, when it came to cleaning up the stove, counters, oven, microwave, floors, couches, the island, the coffee counter, and basically anything in our shared living space, I was the only one to do it. Every single day, Im picking up disgusting used napkins, leftover fast food, ANYTHING. I have two cats who eat anything and everything so I have to clean up so they don't end up eating any of the leftover junk food that's left on the counter.

The constant cleaning up after everyone has made me consistently stressed. And Im not saying that I don't make messes too. But instead of just cleaning up after myself, Im cleaning up after four people every day. It would be fine if they also cleaned up after four people daily but no, it is just me doing it. It may seem stupid, and I admit it might not seem like a big deal, but I prefer not to live in complete filth with trash, stains on counters, and food piled up everywhere in our shared living space. WE DID DISCUSS THIS BEFORE! Before we moved in, we agreed that we would try to keep everything clean. It does not have to be perfect, but at least not trash everywhere and nasty stains on our counters.

I went through a depressive episode for the last month where I did not clean anything in the lviign room or kitchen. It got to a point where everything completely pilled up. All of our dishes were dirty, every single utensil, cookware, everything. I admit, some of those dishes were mine and I should have been cleaning up after myself. In my head, I was just exhausted from life and the grief I was going through but also the fact I felt like a maid for the three other adults I live with.

A week ago when I was determined to get my life back together, I asked my roommates if we could all clean up the kitchen. The girl and 1 of the guys agreed. ""Sarah"" and ""Ethan"" agreed to start cleaning and we set a time of 12 pm the following day. Meanwhile Ben completely ignored my messagejudgment. When it hit 12 pm, suddenly, Ben and Ethan were not at the apartment except for me and Sarah. We continued to clean anyway since we had previous plans. I knew no one would want to tackle the huge mountain of dirty dishes. After wiping most of the counters, I started the dishes, which took me around two hours. ""Sarah"" did help me for 1/3 of them so she did help! Ben took the trash out but honestly, I wish he did more. Ethan did not help us clean up, which he commonly does. I do not remember the last time Ethan decided to help clean our living spaceI admit some of those dishes were mine, and I should have been cleaning up after myself.,e even though

You may be wondering if I had communicated this before, and YES. Many times in our group chat I would text ""Hey when are you all free to do a group cleaning session"" Just to be left on read or delivered. I can not count how many times I have communicated how we had to clean to avoid bugs. I would leave screenshots, but I do not want my roommates to find this post.

My Faults. I do have many faults, such as leaving my dishes sometimes in the sink. I also contributed to the very large dish pile-up that happened, but I did clean up all of it. As a result, we split our two sinks into the girl's side and the boys' side. But now, I come home to dishes that Ethan had used to cook with hum and his girlfriend in my side. I clean them anyway because I don't want to be that annoying roommate, but I already know that Ethan and Ben don't like me as much.

For context with my relationship with Ethan. I felt like we were becoming really close friends. However, one instance made me feel I was wrong with my judgement. He was supposed to come with me to get my tattoo at 5pm on a certain day. at 4:40 when we were about to leave, I asked Ben where he was and he said that he was out running errands. I texted Ethan asking when we was going to be back and he said that he was probably not coming because he told Ben and his girlfriend he was going to to go somewhere with them. It made me really frustrated because he told me that he was going to come with me but he blew me off last minute and told me he was going to hang out with other people. I want to make it clear, HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TOO! But it really hurt me, and that basically gives an explanation of my relationship with him. I thought we were close but I don't think so.

The whole reason why Im writing this post is because I just spent the last hour cleaning. I came back from running errands to find a lot of rice and dishes in my own sink that I knew I had not done. I cleaned them anyway because I knew it was Ben and his girlfriend. But they were in our living room and I don't want to argue. I cleaned everything, including the dishes, the floors, and the rest of the living room and kitchen. Ben and I have been accumulating recycling boxes, and I went to his room and asked when he had the time if he could take them down. YES! It is my fault that I asked him to take down the boxes when some of them were mine. I admit that is so fucked up to do. I just thought that because I clean up after his mess as a result of cooking he would.

He said yes, but then when I went to turn around, his girlfriend yelled from the room, ""You mean YOUR boxes?!"" In a very rude tone. I returned and just said, ""Yes, the recycling boxes"". But I never thought she would talk to me like that. I loved the girlfriend and I thought we were cool. After a while, I  felt she didn't like me, but I didn't want to follow my gut feeling. Within the past two weeks, whenever she comes over she just says ""hey"" to me in a weird tone. Sometimes, not even looking at me. It might be my brain playing tricks on me but after today, I know for sure she doesn't me.   Im a sensitive person so after our little interaction, I went to my room to talk to my mom, and she told me not to cry LOL. She wants me to return her attitude, but I physically can't. I do not like being rude or mean to people.

I spoke to my roommate Sarah about the situation and she said that me cleaning up their mess does not equate to Ben taking down my boxes. Which is completely reasonable but they are both Ben and mine boxes. But she has a point. After I finish writing this, I will just take down the boxes altogether because I admit I was wrong for asking Ben to take them down.

But all around, I feel crazy but still defeated. Am I in the wrong? Its okay, I really want brutally honest answers. I always want to make myself a better person and roommate. What can I do better?

Greetings fellow tokers both medical and recreational! I hope everyone is having a great day. Today we're diving deep into an intensive strain analysis of Stay Puft and its genetics, made possible through our collaboration with the Crysp team. *Shout out to the Team for making this analysis happen.* This isn't your typical review - we're going to break down every aspect of this strain through a scientific lens, examining both the original genetics and Crysp's interpretation of this fascinating cultivar. If you were looking for just a quick review, I've added a TLDR at the very end, just for you.

## About Crysp

In the rapidly evolving hemp market, Crysp has established themselves as a cultivation-focused company specializing in premium hemp flower. Their business model centers on adapting established cannabis genetics for the hemp market, with particular attention to maintaining complex terpene profiles and physical characteristics of the original strains.

🏢 **Company Focus:**
* Indoor cultivation of premium hemp flower
* Preservation of traditional cannabis genetics
* Three-tier quality classification system
* Direct-to-consumer sales model

Crysp utilizes a tiered system for their products, with Stay Puft designated as a Tier 1 offering ($100/quarter, shipping included). This classification reflects their assessment of the strain's genetic complexity, cultivation requirements, and overall quality metrics.

What distinguishes their approach is their emphasis on genetic preservation in hemp cultivation. Rather than developing new hemp-specific strains, they focus on adapting established cannabis genetics while maintaining compliance with federal guidelines. With this particular strain, the genetics were spot on.

### Crysp's Interpretation

What makes this version particularly fascinating is Crysp's successful adaptation of these elite genetics for the hemp market. They've managed to preserve the complex terpene profiles and distinctive characteristics while maintaining full Farm Bill compliance. The strain has already influenced the broader cannabis market, demonstrating that premium hemp flower can maintain the sophisticated characteristics of its ancestors while being accessible to a broader audience.

### The $100 Question: Is Crysp's Stay Puft Worth Tier 1 Status?

Before we dive into these elite genetics, let's address the premium price point. At $100 per quarter (shipping included), this Tier 1 offering positions itself at the top of the hemp market. The question isn't just about quality - it's about whether Crysp has successfully translated a potent 25% THC strain into a premium hemp experience.

### Genetic Background & Parent Analysis

Stay Puft represents modern cannabis breeding at its finest, combining two powerhouse strains that each bring distinct and complementary characteristics to create something extraordinary.

> **Parent 1: Marshmallow OG**
>
> Here's a fun bit of cannabis culture - the name perfectly describes its distinctive vanilla/marshmallow terpene profile. This phenotype emerged as a standout for its unique sweet expression and consistently high cannabinoid production.
> A highly sought-after cultivar contributing:
> * Signature vanilla-forward terpene profile
> * Dense, tight bud formation
> * Heavy resin production
> * Thick flower clusters
> * Traditional potency: 22-25% THC
> * Distinctive creamy sweetness

> 🍇 **Parent 2: Grape Gasoline**
>
> Part of the modern wave of gas-forward strains, this parent brought sophisticated grape-fuel profiles and enhanced resin production to the cross. The combination created something special that would give Stay Puft its distinctive berry-fuel characteristics.
> A modern heavyweight adding:
> * Complex grape-berry notes
> * Heavy gas/diesel backend
> * Purple-tinged expression
> * Exceptional trichome coverage
> * Traditional potency: 23-27% THC
> * Strong lateral branching

### Hybrid Expression & Characteristics

Where these genetics meet, Stay Puft demonstrates the best of both parents:

* Trichome Profile: Marshmallow OG's heavy resin meets Grape Gasoline's crystal production
* Aroma: Sweet vanilla forward profile with complex grape-gas backend
* Structure: Dense framework with improved calyx development
* Color: Rich green base with purple potential
* Traditional Potency: Consistently testing around 25% THC

## Aroma Analysis

I had hyped this up so much that when it arrived, I was afraid I was setting myself up for the inevitable letdown. As soon as I opened the mylar, that sentiment changed quick. I was hit with a POWERFUL sweet/vanilla forward profile with strong hints of berry with a diesel backend that meets the vanilla to come full circle. The genetics of the parents could not be more obvious. Diesel grape notes X marshmallow notes. This is a level of aroma you just don't usually get without spending the extra money.

I can confidently say from experience it rivals any strain I've had in the medical market in potency of smell and goes beyond it with its complexity. This puts a capstone in an argument I had earlier with someone on Reddit; There is absolutely no reason anybody should be questioning the genetics of what they order. If you are ordering from a company and you're not positive when you taste it, smell it, smoke it, if it's the legitimate strain it's either low quality or incorrectly expressed genetics. There is no guess work anymore, while terpene profiles can vary from iteration to iteration, ratios do not and quality genetics and bud is immediately recognizable by anyone who knows what to look for.

## Physical Analysis

When you first open the mylar bag containing Crysp's Stay Puft, you're immediately struck by the quality of what you're looking at. Seven grams of absolutely beautiful, chunky nugs present themselves, showcasing the best of both parent strains' physical characteristics.

### Structure & Cure
* Bud Structure: Chunky, dense formations
* Density: Perfect compression without being rock-hard
* Trim: Clean, professional hand-trim
* Formation: Tight, well-developed calyxes
* Trichome Preservation: Exceptional, intact heads

The cure on these buds is nothing short of perfect. They have that ideal squishy, sticky quality with excellent bounce-back when squeezed - telltale signs of proper curing and hydration. ""Fresh"" doesn't quite capture it; these buds feel like they were packaged yesterday.

### Visual Breakdown
The coloration is immediately striking - bright, vibrant greens intermingled with lighter sage variations, and occasional purple tones creating a dynamic palette that catches the light. Bright orange pistils weave throughout the structure, but what really demands attention is the trichome coverage. This isn't just a light dusting. The level of resin production is exactly what you'd expect from a Tier 1 offering.

### Market Comparison
Having extensive experience with Pennsylvania's medical program, I can confidently say this exceeds the appearance of about 95% of what's available there. The similarity to Strane or Holistic Industries' top-shelf offerings is striking - this is premium grade material by any market's standards.

## Effects Analysis & Patient Experience

*MEDICAL DISCLAIMER: While I possess extensive cannabis knowledge and real-world experience as a patient, I am not a medical professional. This analysis serves as an experiential reference point based on my personal medical conditions and responses. Always consult healthcare providers about your specific situation.*

### Patient Background & Context

As someone managing multiple conditions through cannabis therapy, my experience spans recreational, legacy and medical type 1, 2, and 3 flower markets.

👤 **Patient Profile**

**Demographics:**
* Age: 39
* Gender: Male
* Weight: 190lbs
* Cannabis Experience: 25 years
* Tolerance Level: Medium
* Consumption Method: Flower smoker
* Recovery Status: 29 months

**Medical Conditions:**
* Primary:
  * Insomnia
  * Depressive Disorder
  * Childhood-based PTSD
  * Substance Use Disorder (SUD)
  * Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)
  * Generalized Anxiety
* Physical:
  * Sports-related knee trauma
  * Lower lumbar fracture
* Other:
  * Autism Spectrum

### Pre-Medication State

Today's testing conditions weren't ideal, but they provided an excellent opportunity to evaluate Stay Puft's effectiveness under stress. After my standard 5-hour reset period, I found myself in a particularly challenging state. Twelve hours of intensive review writing had my lumbar fracture screaming, and the combination of Wellbutrin and too much coffee in a crowded café had my anxiety peaked.

**Pre-Medication Metrics:**

**Pain Level: 7/10**
* Context: Extended sitting (12 hours) during review writing
* Location: Primary lower back discomfort

**Anxiety Level: 9/10**
* Contributing Factors:
  * Excessive caffeine intake
  * Wellbutrin medication
  * Crowded, noisy environment
* Symptoms: Fidgety, environmental discomfort

**Mood Level: 5/10**
* Baseline (typically trends negative)
* Notable: Political content fatigue

**Energy Level: 5/10**
* State: Post-caffeine decline
* Note: Not experiencing lethargy

The environment actually worked in our favor for testing - when you're reviewing something for anxiety relief, being in an anxiety-inducing situation provides valuable data points. The pain levels, while uncomfortable for me personally, gave us a solid baseline for measuring relief potential.

### Consumption Experience & Sensory Journey

The ritual began with rolling 0.5g into a 1¼ ZigZag cone - my standard method for consistency in reviews. Even before lighting it was tasty; The dry pull was candy-like sweetness. 

The initial hits brought forward the vanilla and berry notes promised by the Marshmallow OG and Grape Gasoline genetics, but with a complexity that built throughout the session. By the halfway point, something interesting - the emergence of distinct tootsie roll notes, followed by unexpected but delightful cinnamon undertones. Strange but true. The resin production was so substantial that relighting became necessary - a quality issue I'm happy to have.

### Effects Timeline

**Immediate Onset:**
The effects announced themselves in classic fashion - that familiar sensation behind the eyes that veterans know well. What happened next was unexpected from my experience with THCa flower. A wave of relief literally washed down my back and into my feet, the kind of effect I usually associate with classic indicas. Powerful therapeutic effects.

**20-Minute Mark:**
* Pain relief holding strong
* Anxiety dropping to manageable levels
* Mood noticeably elevated - catching myself smiling for no particular reason
* Freedom of movement improved significantly

**Overall Character:**
While it's classified as a hybrid, this leans heavily into indica territory in terms of effects. Don't get me wrong - you're not getting couch-locked, but the pain-killing properties are front and center. What's impressive is getting this level of relief without the mental fog.

### Final Metrics & Impact

**Post-Medication Results:**

**Pain: 3/10** (-4)
The most impressive aspect. This level of pain relief from hemp flower is rare.

**Anxiety: 5/10** (-4)
Brought me back to baseline despite being in an anxiety-triggering environment.

**Mood: 9/10** (+4)
Significant elevation without feeling artificial or forced.

**Energy: 6/10** (+1)
Slight boost, mainly from increased comfort and mobility.

What stands out is how this hits like classic, quality cannabis should. The effects are clean, well-rounded, and surprisingly potent for ""hemp"" flower. For those managing pain and anxiety while maintaining recovery, this could be a game-changer. Classic chest gripping potency if you want it.

The combination of Marshmallow OG and Grape Gasoline genetics translates remarkably well to hemp flower, offering medical patients a viable alternative to traditional cannabis while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.

### Value Assessment

At $100 a quarter (shipped), this sits in Crysp's Tier 1 category. Is it worth it? For patients managing multiple conditions who need to maintain clarity while finding relief, absolutely. For someone who is willing to pay a little extra for real quality? Absolutely. 

The quality matches or exceeds many options in my medical program, and the effects justify the premium pricing.

## A Note to Medical Patients

As someone straddling both worlds - a long-term cannabis user and medical patient who now maintains recovery through carefully selected strains - I feel compelled to address something important. Traditional medical programs, while valuable, aren't the only source of legitimate, potent medicine. Stay Puft, testing at around 25% THC while remaining Farm Bill compliant, proves this point conclusively.

### Breaking Down Barriers

Throughout this review, you've seen numerous references to medical applications. This isn't to exclude recreational users - Stay Puft is excellent for general enjoyment - but rather to highlight something significant: Farm Bill compliant cannabis can absolutely match medical program quality.

💡 **Why This Matters:**
* High-quality, potent options exist outside medical programs
* Farm Bill compliance doesn't mean compromising on effects
* Price comparisons favor these alternative markets
* Quality control matches or exceeds many medical programs
* Accessibility for patients without medical cards

### Evidence in Experience

The effects documented in this review (-4 pain, -4 anxiety, +4 mood) came from a strain testing near 30% THC that's fully compliant with federal law. This matters because it demonstrates that patients have legitimate alternatives to traditional medical programs while maintaining the same level of potency and effect.

### Quality Markers

What makes Stay Puft stand out:
* High THC content (≈25%) while maintaining compliance
* Complete terpene preservation
* Professional cultivation standards
* True genetic authenticity
* Effects that don't just rival but often exceed medical program offerings

This isn't about replacing medical programs - it's about recognizing that Farm Bill compliant cannabis has evolved to provide legitimate, potent options that deserve consideration in any patient's toolkit.

*Note: Every patient's needs are unique. This review aims to provide data points for informed decision-making, not medical advice.*

### Final Verdict

Stay Puft represents what hemp flower can be when treated with the same respect and attention as traditional cannabis. Crysp has managed to capture the essence of a 25% THC strain in a compliant hemp flower, maintaining the sophisticated terpene profile and effects while eliminating concerns about THC content.

For patients like myself, managing multiple conditions while maintaining recovery, this kind of effective alternative is invaluable. It's a premium product at a premium price point, but it delivers premium results.
