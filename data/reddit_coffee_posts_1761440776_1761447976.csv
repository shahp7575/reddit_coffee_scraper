1oga2s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1oga2s3/find_a_normal_job_or_divorce_shouted_the/,"Find a normal job, or divorce!"" shouted the unemployed husband, running away to his mother. But she just smiled and said, ""Perhaps it will be better this way...""","October was soggy, wet and windy. The wind tore off the last golden leaves from the trees and chased them around the yard, driving them into the corners and under the cars.

Alina, standing by the window, fastened the zipper of her sports jacket and, looking at this autumn chaos, caught herself thinking that there was exactly the same blizzard inside her. Torn shreds of patience, hard-to-hold remnants of hope and a cold, almost physical feeling of fatigue.

It was half past seven in the morning on the clock. Thirty minutes later, I had to be at my first job - in the medical center, where Alina was on duty as an administrator. The second shift, cleaning the offices, I waited for her in the afternoon.

Two jobs, one mortgage and less and less confidence that there is anyone in this life you can rely on.

He and Denis got a two-room apartment on the seventh floor two years ago. Then everything seemed possible. Denis, energetic, self-confident, worked as a manager in a construction company, talked about prospects, about growth, about ""his business in the future"".

Alina listened, believed and was even proud: here, they say, what a husband she has - purposeful, with ambitions. She herself then worked as an administrator in the clinic and received little, but together it seemed to them that it would be enough for everything. The main thing is that there is love, understanding and a common cause.

But in the spring everything collapsed.

The company where Denis worked went bankrupt. The promised payments were delayed, then canceled altogether. Denis was left without a penny. At first, he held on - sent out resumes, went to interviews. But the further I went, the more my hands went down. ""Crisis"", ""everything is seized"", ""they don't take me because the salaries are ridiculous"" - excuses became familiar, and the days - similar to each other.

Alina took a second job at that time to prevent mortgage delays. Tired, I came home after ten o'clock in the evening and each time I met the same picture: a TV, crumbs on the table, unwashed dishes and Denis stretched out on the couch with a remote control in his hand.

He didn't even pretend to be looking for a job.

- Denis, at least you'll vacuum while I'm away,"" she asked quietly, taking off her shoes with difficulty.

- What's the point? - he waved it off lazily. - We'll do it again tomorrow anyway. Anyway, Alin, I'm not a housekeeper. I'm a man. It's not up to me to drag the vacuum cleaner.

- Then get a job, - she answered causticly. - Maybe you won't have to stay at home.

But these words only caused irritation.

He started screaming, accusing her of ""pressing"" him, ""not supporting"", ""not believing"".

Sometimes Alina caught herself thinking that she was even afraid to start a conversation. It was as if he had turned into a completely different person: irritable, lazy, offended by the whole world.

Autumn brought not only cold, but also final discord. Denis began to sit on the phone for a long time, complaining to his friends that ""his wife is completely a star"", that ""he works as a cleaner and makes a earner out of herself"".

Alina accidentally heard these words when he was talking on speakerphone. Something inside it broke off then. She suddenly realized: there is no respect in this house anymore. Neither to her nor to her work.

On that ill-fated Thursday, she came home closer to eleven. In the office center where she was cleaning, one of the washing machines broke down, I had to wash everything by hand. My back hurt, my fingers were shaking from fatigue, and my head was making noise from lack of sleep.

And here's the picture: there's a slot in the kitchen. Oil on the walls, shell underfoot, sink clogged with dirty dishes, and a frying pan with traces of burnt eggs emits an unpleasant smell.

- Denis! - the voice broke into a scream. - What is this?!

The husband appeared at the door, yawning and scratching the back of his head.

- Why? I ate. You'll clean it up tomorrow, I'm tired.

- Tomorrow? - Alina couldn't believe her ears. - And what prevents you from cleaning up today?

- My head hurts. I've been thinking all day about where to earn extra money. Nervous tension.

The laughter broke out by itself - short, hysterical, almost without air.

- Tension? - she raised her hands, as if not believing that she heard it. - Denis, I work twelve hours to pay for this apartment, and you lie on the couch and call it ""tension""?

- Don't shout! - he barked, instantly flashing. - I'm a man, and you're just a wife! Have you forgotten your seat? A woman should inspire, not cut!

- To inspire? - Alina repeated quietly, feeling the heat running down her cheeks. - For what? For another portion of dumplings and whining?

- You don't pull the family! - he shouted, stomping his foot. - A normal wife would find a way to earn more! And you wash the floors for pennies! You're humiliating me!

Her lips twitched.

Are you humiliating?

Is he an unemployed man who lives on her money, who accuses her of humiliation?

- Find a normal job, - Denis shouted, as if he had shot. - Or a divorce!

The words flew around the kitchen like shards of glass.

It became so quiet for a second that you could hear the water boiling in the kettle. Alina stood looking at her husband, and suddenly realized that she no longer felt anger or resentment. Only emptiness. As if all the emotions came out along with these words.

- Okay, - she said quietly. - Divorce is a divorce.

Denis froze, as if he didn't expect such an answer.

He wanted to scare, not hear the agreement.

- You just... - he started, but didn't finish. He grabbed his jacket sharply, slammed the door loudly and flew out of the apartment.

He was followed only by the knock of his steps on the stairs and the ringing sound of the front door slammed.

It became unusually quiet in the apartment.

No TV, no grumbling, no stomping. Even the air seems to have become lighter.

Alina slowly approached the window, looked down: the wet asphalt reflected the yellow lights. A bus passed somewhere in the distance, and raindrops ran down the glass in long threads.

She turned on the kettle, brewed strong black tea, took out a dry bun from the breadbasket.

I felt something strange - lightness. Not the one that happens with joy, but the one that comes when you finally let go of the weight that you have been carrying for too long.

Denis, of course, went to his mother. To Gala Mikhailovna - a woman who all her life believed that ""a man in the house is a god"", and his wife is obliged to feed, stroke and be silent.

She must have already cooked borscht, poured a stack for her son and comforts: ""My poor boy, she doesn't appreciate you.""

But Alina didn't care about it anymore.

She sat in the kitchen until late at night, remembering how it all began: how Denis gave flowers, how he promised that he would always be there, how he called her ""the sun"".

And how gradually these words turned into ""you're late again"", ""you don't look good"", ""you've become cold"".

No, it didn't get cold. She just stopped basing herself from the man who sucks life out of her.

That night Alina slept surprisingly peacefully. No alarms, no waiting for steps in the corridor, no internal tension.

In the morning, waking up before the alarm clock, she felt - for the first time in many months - lightness.

It was drizzling outside, but even the gray sky didn't seem gloomy.

She cooked herself breakfast - just, without haste. I got dressed, put on light makeup and looked at myself in the mirror.

The eyes are clear. The face is calm. It's as if all the heavy things that have been accumulating for the past few months have left the apartment together with Denis.

At work, colleagues immediately noticed the changes.

- Alina, you're just shining today, - nurse Sveta, who became her close friend, was surprised. - What happened? Did your husband find a job?

Alina grinned, putting the cup on the counter.

- No, Svet. My husband is gone. To mom's. With the threat of divorce.

- Oh, God, - she splashed her hands. - And what are you doing now?

- It's okay, - Alina answered calmly. - You know, I think I feel better.

- Easier? But you have a mortgage, an apartment, expenses...

Alina shrugged her shoulders:

- And I dragged all this alone. So nothing has changed - except that the house is now clean and quiet.

Sveta laughed softly:

- Maybe it's for the best. Sometimes loneliness is calmer than living with someone who prevents you from breathing.

In the evening, returning home under the drizzling rain, Alina stopped at the household appliances store.

The showcase reflected her silhouette. She suddenly realized: here she is, a woman who was accused yesterday of ""inability to pull the family"". He stands straight, his eyes are burning, and inside there is confidence that he will cope. Without him, without suts, without eternal excuses.

That evening, she turned on her favorite music for the first time in a long time, lit a candle and just sat down to read a book.

No anxiety, no guilt.

The phone rang several times - Denis. Then Denis' mother. Then it's him again.

Alina didn't answer.

She just put the phone on silent mode and finished her tea.

Three days later, Denis came to the doorstep. Unshaven, with a tired face, with a bouquet of roses in his hands.

- Alin, I'm a fool, - he started from the threshold. - Forgive me, please. I realized everything. My mom told me I was wrong. Let's start over.

She looked at him carefully, but without the usual excitement. Neither the heart tightened, nor the hands trembled.

- Denis, - she said softly, - I don't hate you. It's just... I don't want to live like this anymore.

He froze.

- Is it because of my mistake? I promise, I'll start looking for a job!

- Not because of a mistake, - she shook her head. - Because I finally realized: I don't have to be strong for two. I'm tired of being both husband and wife at the same time.

He lowered his eyes silently.

He stood, then turned around and left.

This time the door closed softly - without shouting, without anger. Just quietly.

Two months have passed.

Alina transferred to another clinic - they offered a higher rate and a convenient schedule.

In the evenings, she no longer rushed to work part-time, but took care of herself: she went to yoga, read books, met with friends.

At first it was unusual to return to an empty apartment, but over time this feeling of loneliness was replaced by calmness.

Now the silence was not emptiness, but freedom.

Sometimes her mother-in-law called her - with reproaches, with persuasions ""to make peace for the sake of the family"". Alina answered calmly:

- Galina Mikhailovna, family is when two pull together, and not one pulls, and the other sits on top.

And that's where the conversation ended.

In the spring, on the first warm day, she walked along the embankment after work, holding a cup of coffee in her hands. People laughed, couples were walking under the sun, and my chest was so light, as if life was starting anew.

She thought: it's strange how often women tolerate just because they're afraid to be alone.

They are afraid - and they put chains on their hands themselves.

But sometimes, to become happy, you just need not to be afraid to let go of someone who prevents you from breathing.

Alina smiled.

1oga2mv,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditWritesSeinfeld/comments/1oga2mv/jerry_donates_big_at_a_charity_event_but_isnt/,Jerry donates big $ at a charity event but isn't announced like smaller donors. Elaine drinks kahlua w/ coffee thinking its fancy creamer. A frightened Kramer gets locked in a Spirit Halloween. George & Frank battle kids who TP his house from off brand Halloween candy,"Jerry goes to a Halloween masquerade charity event. They announce everyone's donations by name (with comments on levels of generosity) as they come in. 

Jerry donates several thousand dollars, but as he does it the mayor walks in and has his presence announced. Jerry's date thinks Jerry's cheap. He tries to prove he made a donation and convince the announcer to re-announce his donation.

At work, Elaine typically hates Halloween. The costumes annoy her and she hates the work parties. The worst part is the company is run &owned by a Baptist so they don't ever allow alcohol, even at work parties. She usually refuses to wear costumes then gets told she's not a team player. She regularly joked that she'd be on board with a little booze in her system.

This day she's at Jerry's before work and makes coffee there. She looks for creamer and finds a bottle of kahlua. She just reads ""coffee"" and ""-er""(from liqueur) and thinks it's creamer. She tries it and loves it and asks if she can take it. Jerry isn't paying attention and waves for her to take it. Kramer simply comments ""Stick it to the man, soul sister"" as she leaves.

She's very tired so has lots of coffee with creamer during the morning. suddenly Halloween seems fun and the costumes are funny. She even makes a makeshift costume from her work outfit. It's all fine and dandy til she's accused of being drunk at a presentation in the board room....

Kramer meanwhile is asked to buy an extra piece for Jerry's costume for his masquerade charity event. He goes to Spirit Halloween with Newman to pick up some fake blood and vampire teeth, and for Newman to hit on the cute cashier he has a crush on. 

As they pass the motion-detector skeletons and the machines jump and yell, Kramer gets progressively more terrified and tells a story of a harrowing haunted house experience as a child. He panicked, ran, bumped his head, knocked himself out and peed his pants. He had to move schools because the kids at school called him Scooby Doo.

They try makeup and various face paints and fake blood on each other to sample, and lose track of time. In the background the store announces a recall of certain face paints due to hallucinogenic paint.

As they lose track of time, and the cashier was actively avoiding Newman, she closes up and the two  end up being unnoticed and locked inside.

They realize there is an emergency exit through the back of the warehouse but they have to go all the way through the store, and all the spooky creature machines are turned on. They have to walk through an enclosed Haunted Castle that takes up the entire aisle leading to the employee/warehouse door.

George goes to see his parents for Halloween due to everyone else having stuff to do, and his family have a tradition of watching *Twilight Zone* marathon til midnight. 

He eats from their candy supply. George notices half their candy is name brand (100 grand, snickers, kit kat, Mike n Ikes, etc) and half of it is knockoffs. There is a significant drop in quality. Frank comments that he's feeding the entire neighborhood and they're lucky to be getting anything (""when I asked for candy as a child, you know what I got? An onion and a lighter"") while Estelle splurged to get *some* brand name candy.
George picks through and only eats the name brand candy while watching the marathon. 

The doorbell rings and trick or treaters are visibly disappointed in the quality of candy. Then some teens see the ""good candy"" wrappers all around the armchair. They question George and he dismisses them. 

Later in the night they hear giggling and suspicious sounds. He and Frank investigate as Estelle shrieks and they realize they've been TPed by the kids. 

George and Frank determine to seek revenge by getting in the car, finding the kids, and stealing their candy for being selfish and ungrateful.

1og9vts,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuriousAF/comments/1og9vts/advice_what_finally_made_me_productive_in_a/,[Advice] What finally made me productive in a chaotic life: 7 brutal truths you won’t hear on TikTok,"Let’s be real. Everyone says “just build a routine” or “manifest success” like they’re life cheats. But what if your life *can’t* be structured? You wake up not knowing what’ll hit you. Maybe it's a last-minute shift, a family thing, burnout, or just your own brain hitting snooze on reality. Most productivity hacks assume your life is a blank canvas. But for a lot of us, it’s more like a Jackson Pollock painting: loud, messy, unpredictable.

This post is for folks like that. I pulled together insights from *actually* helpful books, research-backed advice, and long-form podcasts. Because most of the stuff I see online, especially on TikTok or IG, is from influencers who’ve clearly never had to multitask survival and self-growth. This isn’t about blaming yourself for being “lazy.” It's about building productivity systems that bend with your chaos, not break under it.

Here’s what actually helped:

1. **Work with your energy, not against it**
Instead of fighting randomness, use it. Dr. Andrew Huberman (neuroscientist at Stanford) talks about “ultradian cycles” on Huberman Lab Podcast. Your alertness naturally rises and falls every 90 to 120 minutes. You don’t need a 9-to-5 mindset to be productive. You need a 90-minute mindset. When you feel sharp, do hard tasks. When your brain’s mush, switch to low-effort stuff. Your energy > your schedule.

2. **Redefine what “productive” even means**
A lot of burnout comes from chasing fake productivity metrics. Cal Newport, in *Deep Work*, explains that real productivity means focusing deeply on a few key things, not checking off 30 low-impact tasks. Ask: “What’s the ONE thing today that, if done, makes everything else easier?” That’s your real job today. Don’t confuse motion with progress.

3. **Use “micro-planning” instead of rigid routines**
If your days are unpredictable, don’t plan your life like a military schedule. Try time “blocking” in four-hour chunks. Mornings: focus work. Afternoons: admin or calls. Evenings: recharge. Then adjust within those blocks. The podcast *The Daily Stoic* talks about preparing for chaos by expecting it. Micro-planning helps you adapt without feeling like you failed.

4. **Use tech that adapts to your brain**
The right tools can seriously change the game. Two I found insanely helpful:

  - **BeFreed**: Wildly underrated AI learning app built by a team from Columbia. It takes expert books, lectures, and real success stories, then turns them into personalized audio lessons based on your goals. You can pick how deep you want to go—10, 20, or 40 mins—and even choose your host’s voice (mine sounds like a chill older sibling). It learns from what you listen to and builds an adaptive learning path that updates as you grow. It’s helped me stay mentally sharp even when I’m physically drained. Also, it has a huge library of all the books and podcasts I’m about to recommend below.

  - **Structured**: An underrated daily planner app that lets you drag and drop tasks like Tetris. It’s perfect if your day keeps changing. Visual and satisfying.

5. **This book will make you rethink your entire relationship with time**
*Four Thousand Weeks* by Oliver Burkeman. New York Times bestseller. Burkeman, a long-time productivity skeptic, writes like your smartest friend who’s also deeply existential. The title refers to how long the average human life is. The book doesn’t give hacks. It gives perspective. And ironically, that makes it one of the most practical productivity books ever. It made me stop chasing “the perfect life schedule” and start designing a life that works *with* time, not against it. Best reality-check book I’ve ever read.

6. **Not all motivation has to come from inside you**
One of the best things I learned from behavioral scientist BJ Fogg (author of *Tiny Habits*) is that environment beats willpower. Want to read more? Leave your book on the pillow. Want to journal? Keep it by the coffee maker. Want to stop doomscrolling? Log out. Motivation is overrated. Design wins.

7. **Start your day with dopamine, not dread**
Mel Robbins (from *The Mel Robbins Podcast*) talks a lot about starting your day with momentum. Not scrolling or stress. Try this: before touching your phone, complete one micro-win. Make your bed, drink water, breathe outside. Your brain registers the “win” and releases dopamine, which makes the next task easier. Momentum is chemical. Stack your wins.

8. **This YouTube series is like therapy for chaotic brains**
Ali Abdaal’s *Productivity for the Rest of Us* playlist. He’s a doctor turned creator who doesn’t scream “wake up at 5 AM” at you. He breaks down systems like PARA, Time Blocking, and Energy Mapping in ways that actually feel doable. Also shares his own struggles with burnout. It’s honest and practical.

9. **Get out of your head and into your body**
If you’re stuck in brain fog, don’t try to think your way out. Move. A 2022 meta-analysis in the *Journal of Affective Disorders* showed that just 10 minutes of light movement can significantly improve cognitive focus and mood. Doesn’t have to be a workout. Walk. Stretch. Dance. Shake off the mental clutter.

10. **Go analog once a week**
Digital life = infinite options = decision fatigue. Try a weekly “analog day” or even a half-day. No screens. Just pen, paper, and real-life stuff. The book *Digital Minimalism* by Cal Newport makes a strong case about how our tools are controlling us more than we control them. This reset helps you think clearer and prioritize better.

You don’t need to control your day. You need tools that let you adjust to it. And a mindset that stops punishing you for not being a machine. Start with one of these shifts. See what sticks. Chaos doesn’t have to kill your productivity. It just needs a better game plan.",1,1761447307.0,CuriousAF,0,1.0,False

I walked in and was immediately hit by the scent of him, that familiar mix of motor oil, pine soap, and Silas.
The apartment was too small. He was a commanding presence even when he wasn't in the room. His discarded flannel was slung over the back of the armchair, the one he’d bled on. His boots were by the door, caked in grime. The copy of Swann's Way was still on the coffee table. The paradox of him was everywhere.
I heard the shower running in the bathroom. A steady, rushing sound.
My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I nearly jumped out of my skin. I pulled it out.
Ben: Oh, okay. No problem. Thanks for letting me know!
I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding. It was done. That door was closed. I had closed it, firmly, with Silas as my witness.
And now I was in a small apartment with the man I’d just chosen, and I had no idea what the new rules were.
I went into the kitchen. The pasta from last night was still in a pot on the stove. It was something to do. I could heat up the pasta. That was a normal, roommate thing to do. I turned on the burner, the click click click of the gas ignition sounding offensively loud.
I was stirring cold spaghetti when the water in the bathroom shut off.
My entire body went rigid. The silence that fell was heavy. Expectant. I just kept stirring, my back to the bathroom door, listening. I heard the door creak open. I heard bare feet on the hardwood floor.
I didn't turn around. I couldn't.
""Smells good,"" his voice rumbled, closer than I expected.
I flinched, turning. He was standing at the edge of the kitchen, not three feet away.
And it was... a lot.
He was fresh from the shower, steam still rising from his skin. His hair was dark and damp, curling around his ears. He was wearing an old, faded pair of gray sweatpants that hung low on his hips, and nothing else.
I'd seen him shirtless before, we'd gone swimming in the quarry last summer, but this was different. This wasn't public. This was domestic. This was our home, at night, after... after everything.
His chest was broad, dusted with hair. I could see the faint, silvery lines of old scars I'd never noticed. He was scrubbing his hair dry with a towel, his arms flexing. He was all lean muscle and warm skin.
I swallowed, hard, and turned back to the pasta. ""It's, uh. Just leftovers.""
""My favorite kind.""
He walked past me, and I had to lean forward over the stove to avoid brushing against him. He was so warm. He went to the fridge and pulled out a beer. He leaned against the counter opposite me, popped the top, and just... watched me.
There it was. That look. The What? look, but it was loaded now. It was heavy with the unsaid things from the truck.
My hand was shaking as I stirred. ""So,"" I said, my voice strained. ""The truck sounds good. No... no shing shing shing.""
""Nope."" He took a long drink, his eyes never leaving me.
This was torture. He wasn't going to help me. He had said his piece, and now he was waiting for me to say mine. He was a witch, and he was, in his own assbackwards way, a sweetheart. But he was not... easy.
""Silas,"" I said, turning off the stove. I gripped the wooden spoon. ""About what you said. In the truck.""
He just raised an eyebrow. ""What about it?""
""What... what did you mean?"" I asked, my voice barely a whisper. I was looking at the pot, at the red sauce, at anything but him.
""What'd you think I meant, Asa?""
I squeezed my eyes shut. Of course. He was going to make me say it. He was going to make me be the ""bad liar"" and force me to tell the truth. I could feel him reading me, peeling back the layers of my cowardice.
""I... I think..."" I started. I was going to do it. I was going to say it. I think you know I love you. I think you...
The world exploded.
Or rather, the front door did. It slammed open, and a whirlwind of perfume, scarves, and chaotic energy blew into the apartment.
""Hiiiiii! I come bearing wine and a deep seated need for gossip!""
Chloe.
She bustled in, kicking the door shut with her heel, her arms full of a tote bag and two bottles of cheap rosé.
""I figured we could order pizza, my treat. Asa, you have to tell me everything about Ben, and Si... oh.""
She stopped dead. She took in the scene. Me, frozen at the stove, gripping a spoon like a weapon. Silas, leaning against the counter, half naked, holding a beer, his expression unreadable. The air in the apartment was so thick you could have cut it with a knife.
""Ooh,"" Chloe said, her voice dropping. ""Sorry. Did I... interrupt... whatever this is?""
I watched Silas. I watched the man I was about to confess something to. He didn't move for a second. Then, it was like watching a curtain fall. His shoulders, which had been relaxed, tensed. The look in his eyes, which had been sharp and focused on me, went flat and distant. He was gone. He’d retreated behind the wall.
""It's nothin',"" he muttered. He pushed off the counter, grabbed his flannel from the armchair, and slung it over his shoulders, not even bothering with the armholes. He was covering himself. ""I'm... gonna read.""
He grabbed his book, sat in his chair, and disappeared. Just like that. The man who had been a live wire of tension was now just a guy in a chair with a book.
I felt a surge of... I didn't know what. Relief? Fury? Despair?
""Okay... what was that?"" Chloe whispered, moving into the kitchen, her eyes wide. ""He's in a mood.""
""He's always in a mood, Chlo,"" I sighed, turning back to the stove, my shoulders slumping. The moment was gone. It had shattered.
""No, that was a mood. Anyway! Pizza! But first,"" she set the wine on the counter, ""tell me! Ben. He texted you, right? I told him you were quiet but, like, deep.""
I stared at the pasta. I thought about the text. I thought about Silas, sitting in that chair, pretending to read, but I knew, I knew he was listening to every word.
""Asa? Did you text him back? He's so great, isn't he? I think you two would be—""
""Chloe, stop.""
The words were quiet, but they cut through her chatter. She froze. ""What?""
""Just... stop."" I turned around, and I must have looked as exhausted and heartsick as I felt. ""I don't want to talk about Ben. I'm not going to date Ben.""
Chloe's face crumpled. ""But... why? You haven't even met him! Asa, you're not even trying.""
""Yes, I am!"" I snapped, and my voice was louder than I intended. ""That's the problem, Chloe. I am trying. I'm trying really hard. And I don't want him. Okay? I'm not... he's not what I want.""
""Then what do you want, Asa?"" she cried, her voice full of genuine, confused frustration. ""Because you're just... here. You're just here with... with him,"" she gestured toward the living room, ""and you're not living.""
""Maybe this is living,"" I said, my voice low. ""Maybe you don't get to decide what my life is.""
Chloe looked stunned, like I'd slapped her. The silence in the apartment was absolute. There was no sound of a page turning from the living room.
I was breathing hard. I’d never talked to her like that. I looked past her, toward the armchair.
Silas wasn't reading. His book was closed, resting on his lap. He was just watching me, his face half hidden in the shadows of the lamp. His expression was intense. And as I held his gaze, he gave me the smallest, almost imperceptible nod.
It was a nod of approval. A nod that said, Good.
A nod that said, Finally.
I looked from Chloe's hurt, confused face to Silas's dark, expectant one. I had closed one door. I had just cracked another. And now, I was trapped between my two best friends, in a room that was suddenly way, way too small.",1,1761447284.0,Informal_Effect,0,1.0,False

Snoring - mostly every night 

He will fall asleep but continuously wake. Hes not gasping or choking but hes not sleeping soundly. He will be asleep for 5 minutes then wake up and move. The cycle repeats for a while until he gets into a deep enough sleep. 

Waking in the middle of the night. I will find him on the couch and he will say he woke up and came downstairs for a snack. this happens often. 

he is constantly tired. If he sits on the couch he will nap. If we watch tv he falls asleep. He can fall asleep at any time during the day if hes stationary. He will push through the day like normal but hes tired the whole time and yawning, even after coffee. 

I feel like he has apnea and id like him to do a sleep study. Is this something we can ask our primary dr about?

I’m looking for something that starts as friendship — slow burn, genuine connection, getting to know each other deeply and intentionally. Been single for 5 years (by choice) and since tiguwang napud haha, I think I’m ready to find someone who’s also looking to settle down.

A bit about me:
- 29, 5'5"", moreno
- Emotionally available, family- and goal-oriented
- A working professional, currently focused on self-growth
- Into scuba diving, basketball, running, cycling, hiking, and free diving
- Café hopper (always searching for the best matcha/coffee) 
- Loves singing, reading, journaling, and wandering every now and then. 

I’d love to explore new hobbies and experiences with someone — like photography, tennis, badminton, wall climbing, voice/dance lessons, traveling, cooking lessons, enrolling into law school, or maybe even triathlon, ultramarathon, and trail running races someday.

What I’m looking for:
- Single (no kids), 25–35 y.o.
- Goal-oriented, emotionally aware, and open-minded
- Understands that I get busy with work sometimes, but I’ll always make time when needed (non nego since we're all preparing for our future, understading is the key rjud ta ani haha)

- And if you’re thrifty, that’s a plus — pra ma takdan ko haha

Bonus points if:
- Roman Catholic 
- You’re an accomplished professional
- Affectionate and (personal preference) good-looking 😅

1og9r6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1og9r6a/positive_ma_experience_long_semidetailed_time/,"Positive MA experience (long, semi-detailed, time stamps)","Two days ago, I went through Planned Parenthood online, got my pills 24 hours after I ordered them online. I was 5 weeks 5 days pregnant on the date of my medical abortion (yesterday, Friday). I’m a 38 year-old woman with no children, one husband, and some cats. I paid $345 for the pills and shipping. I live in a state with excellent healthcare access, and I chose MA because I didn’t want to wait longer for a surgical procedure. I just wanted this miserable pregnancy to be over.

Meds timeline:
4 mg of zofran around 9 am
4 mg of zofran at 12:40
Mife at 1:20
800 mg ibuprofen at 1:50
Miso vaginally at 2:10
4 mg of zofran at 5:00
800 mg ibuprofen at midnight

First noticeable cramp around 2:30. Potential chills at the same time but I was chilly before so I don’t know if that’s really a symptom. Wanting to poop feelings sort of starting as well. Overall feeling pretty calm. 

3:00 chills, hungry. Went to the bathroom to check, nothing going on yet. Walking around my house to warm up and try to get things going

3:15 chills coming and going, taking a walk around my house. Little tiny pinches of cramps here and there. Assuming things will start picking up in an hour or so.

3:30 cramps steady 1-2/10. Really light, but noticeable. Feel like period cramps. No other symptoms yet.

4:30 finally starting to bleed. Passed a quarter-sized clot immediately. Cramps still minimal. Chills still continuing off and on. Perhaps slight waves of nausea here and there but that honestly could just be from being hungry. 

5:00 cramps staying steady at 1-2/10. Passed another quarter-sized clot, with some blood. Chills starting to lessen. Took 4 mg of zofran just in case. Everything is really chill and calm so far. 

6:30 cramps ramping up, probably 5-6/10. I wonder how bad they would be if I hadnt taken ibuprofen. Hoping the cramps ramping means this will be over soon.

7:15 passed a large clot about the size of a lime, and I think it was the pregnancy. I feel relieved physically. 

8:00 bleeding ramping up a little bit, cramps seem to be ebbing. Passed a couple more large clots without major cramping. Cramps sitting around 3-4/10. Still have some chills but they’re lessening. 

9:00 cramping back up to 5-6/10, steady bleeding, clots, and cramps. Like day one of a bad period. Nausea is all gone, chills gone. I don’t think I feel pregnant anymore. 

9:15 took another 4 mg of zofran. I don’t feel and haven’t felt nauseated in awhile, but don’t want to risk it. Cramps are 6-7/10 and coming in small waves. Bleeding seems like it may be chilling out a little bit, clots are chilling out too.

11:15 cramps have gone back down to 3-4/10. Bleeding is steady and about as heavy as day one of my period, haven’t had any clots in awhile. Tired. Hungry. 

Midnight took 800 mg of ibuprofen. Ate some snacks, drank some water. Feeling back to normal. Watched a movie and went to bed. 

9 am next morning woke up with overnight pad about 3/4 full. No cramps. Feeling normal again, pregnancy symptoms gone (minus sore boobs). Went to work. My appetite today is still a little off, but I’ve been able to drink coffee and eat normal food again.

Overall the biggest symptom I had, other than bleeding/passing clots & cramps, was having chills. My day sucked because having an abortion sucks, but it wasn’t nearly as bad or dramatic as I thought it would be. The pain was never severe, I didn’t have diarrhea, I didn’t feel faint, I never even came close to being sick. I was honestly mostly just bored and wanted it to be over so I could get back to regular life again.

📚 Reader – Mostly sci-fi and fantasy. Currently deep into Dungeon Crawler Carl. Let's talk about our favorite books we read this year.  

🎧 Music - I'm no music buff but I do enjoy going to the occasional show.  I generally enjoy different types of rock ( metalcore, alternative,  psychedelic) and funky electronic music.  I recently saw Sleep Token live and it was amazing.   

🌲 Outdoors stuff – I love hiking with our two huskies, foraging, and just started learning pickleball (I’m still terrible, but it’s fun).

🍻☕ Brews – I’m a craft beer and coffee snob

🐕Pets- I love animals but dogs are my favorite. my partner and I have 2 fur babies. If you have pets please share 

👬 I’m a gay man in a relationship—just looking for an online friend to talk about life, share recipes, tik toks and potentially game. In the chance someone local (WI)  reaches out, maybe we could grab a drink.

there’s this new girl who joined about two months ago she’s super easy to talk to funny always nice to me we started texting a bit outside of work and i started to think maybe she liked me too i know that’s dangerous thinking but she was always friendly and kept the conversation going so i convinced myself there was a spark

last night i saw on the bump app that she was at a restaurant not far from my place my brain short circuited and thought hey maybe i could just walk by and say hi maybe grab a quick bite if she’s alone it sounded harmless in my head so i did it i went there walked inside looked around and saw her sitting across from a guy they were laughing sharing food and clearly on a date i froze like a deer in headlights and then did a full 180 out the door

the worst part is she saw me i know she saw me our eyes met for half a second and i could literally feel my soul leave my body i spent the rest of the night pretending it didn’t happen but i barely slept this morning i opened the bump app and she’s gone maybe she turned on ghost mode maybe she just doesn’t want me to see her location anymore either way i deserved that

it’s totally my fault i read too much into friendly energy and then acted on impulse instead of common sense i’ve been cringing at myself all day and i don’t think i’ll ever look at that app again without feeling secondhand embarrassment from my own stupidity

**TLDR** saw my coworker’s location on the bump app thought she liked me decided to stop by the restaurant she was at found her on a date she saw me and now she’s probably on ghost mode while i’m dying of shame",34,1761446104.0,tifu,19,0.81,False

We can also have dinner or coffee afterward—it's your call. It would also be nice to hang out with new people since life is getting stale again. I hope you have the same drive as I do about the movie and life!

We met at a card shop and enter tournaments a lot arround the city. The thing is, he really likes taking handouts. He’s always talking about how broke he is (which I don’t doubt) and I’ve leant him a lot of expensive cards (about 300$ CAD worth) and he keeps asking for more stuff. 

Every time we go to get coffee has asks if I’ll pay for his coffee (and I have at least 3 times). He said he would pay me back later for the cards, specifying late November but he gets all stressed/angry when ever I bring up HIS money. I once brought up how he has a 650$ deck (he likes to use the most expensive version of every card) and how he could just sell a few from that to make some cash and he just says “this conversation is really pissing me off”

He’s even gone out of the way to sell the very cards I gave him, come back to me and say that he sold it for like 50$ above what I paid, which is fine, I said they were his now, but THEN when I respond with “so are you gonna pay me back early then?” He’s says “bro, you said I could pay you back in November wtf!?” 

Recently I had a talk with him when he asked for more cards to borrow and I said “I can’t keep giving you stuff to hold onto, it’s not fair to put you in that position of debt and obligation to me” because I don’t wanna make him mad when he still owes me. But I don’t know what to say next time he asks me for 10$ to enter a tournament or buy a coffee or use the subway. 

Last thing I’ll say is that he will still give me amazing deals for cards because I’m his friend. He’s offered me 50$ cards for 20$, I did not ask for them, I’ve even said no thanks, and that he could probably get more money from selling to someone else, but he’s like “pleeeease” I think because he wants it fast. He’s not on drugs I don’t think. 

Anyways, what am I to do at this point? i like hanging out with him when he’s not asking for stuff but this is a bit of a new area of life for me. I’ve never met someone who is just constantly pushing for more.",0,1761445943.0,Advice,1,0.5,False

I found it useful to compare the core rankings of life values of myself and someone else (e.g., Core Values like Family, Career, Friends; you can add anything else, like Independence or anything important to you). It was useful because it generated deeper conversation between me and them when we saw our rankings and talked about the differences. ""Why did you add X? Why put this above that?"" This then led to the simple inspiration that every person has an inner ranking that drives everything they do, and it would be fascinating to uncover that and share between people to build empathy.

(I also thought this would be a quick way to learn some of the latest basic full-stack and deployment technologies + test out the latest ai coding tools.)

**The Product**

This simple tool lets you compare rankings of not just Core Values (like one of the options; the original inspiration), but various other categories, like Cuisines, Coffee Drinks, Movie Genres. You can write your own topic and add your own items, too.

[**https://value-ranker.vercel.app/rankings/new**](https://value-ranker.vercel.app/rankings/new)

**> How it works**

Just create your own ranking of some topic (can write your own), save and click ""Ask Friend to Rank"" and it gives you a link that you can share. Your friend then fills out that link, which only has the category you chose, and you both can view the final comparison result. Example:

1og9b47,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1og9b47/why_habit_stacking_is_the_cheat_code_no_one/,Why habit stacking is the cheat code no one taught us: a brutally practical guide that works,"A lot of people I know are quietly overwhelmed by how hard it is to build new habits. We’re told to ""just be more disciplined"" or ""get up earlier"" or ""manifest your dream life"", like that’s supposed to fix the wired chaos of modern life. Worse, there’s a whole ecosystem of influencers pushing aesthetics over real psychology. Like, no, buying a beige water bottle won’t fix your lack of discipline. The truth? Most people don’t fail because they’re lazy. They fail because they’re trying to build new routines from scratch, with no anchors, no scaffolding, no systems. That’s where something like habit stacking becomes an actual game-changer.

This post is a fully researched dive into what actually works. Backed by the best books, psychology research, YouTube explainers, and real-world case studies. No fluff, no vague motivational quotes. Just the stuff that makes habits stick.

The idea of **habit stacking** came into mainstream self-development thanks to James Clear’s *Atomic Habits*, a global bestseller with over 15 million copies sold. Clear breaks down behavioral change into visuals so digestible it feels like cheating. His core insight? You don’t build a habit in a vacuum. You attach it to something you already do. This is called “cue-based behavior design.”

For example, if you already make coffee every morning, stack a new habit on top: do ten pushups while the kettle boils. Or do one page of daily journaling right after brushing your teeth. It's stupid simple, which is why it works.

This approach aligns closely with what Stanford professor BJ Fogg calls “anchor habits” in his book *Tiny Habits*. Fogg, who runs the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford, found that people are more consistent when they tie small actions to already-established routines, like tying flossing to brushing, or gratitude practice to opening your laptop. He calls it “floss one tooth” level small. Because consistency always beats intensity.

And it’s not just theory. A 2021 meta-review in the journal *Health Psychology Review* found that implementation intentions (basically, “if X, then Y” plans) dramatically increase the odds of successfully forming a new habit. Especially when tied to a trigger that already lives in your routine. In other words, stacking isn’t a hack. It’s grounded in behavioral science.

But here’s the piece most people miss: stacking only works when the new habit is frictionless and emotionally rewarding. This means you need to fine-tune your stack. If you hate journaling, don’t force that after teeth-brushing. Pick something you’re at least neutral about. Or gamify it. You also don’t need to start with “productive” habits. Stacking just one minute of deep breathing after opening your fridge can become a gateway to meditation. Weirdly effective.

Want to build social habits? Stack texting a friend with your lunch break. Want to remember to drink more water? Stack it with bathroom breaks. It’s not about creating time. It’s about stealing it back intelligently.

One underrated YouTube channel that goes deep on this is **Matt D'Avella**. His minimalist aesthetic is chill, but he backs it with experiments and meta-habit research. If you're visual, his video ""How to Build Better Habits Without Motivation"" is gold. It breaks down why motivation is unreliable, and why context-driven habits win out long-term. Highly recommend bingeing that.

There’s also a podcast episode from **The Psychology Podcast** with Dr. Wendy Wood (USC professor and author of *Good Habits, Bad Habits*). She points out that 43% of what we do every day is out of habit, not conscious decision. So the goal isn’t to grind harder. It’s to hijack that autopilot.

For books, you absolutely cannot miss **Atomic Habits by James Clear**. It’s the #1 most recommended book in productivity circles for a reason. Every chapter blows your mind with ""Why didn't anyone tell me this before?"" moments. It’s packed with frameworks like the 4 laws of behavior change, habit stacking strategies, identity change systems and more. The visuals alone are genius. This book will make you question everything you think you know about willpower. Easily the most practical guide to long-term habit formation that’s ever been written.

Another one that hits deep is **The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg**, a Pulitzer-winning investigative journalist. This book gives you the science behind how our brains build loops from cue to routine to reward. It’s a bit more narrative than Atomic Habits, but that makes you remember the stories longer. After this book you’ll start seeing habit loops everywhere, your phone addiction, your snacking habits, your procrastination spirals. It messes with your head in the best way.

If you're into apps, **Finch** is a great one. It's disguised like a self-care pet game, but underneath it’s a really clever behavioral system for building positive habits. You name your little pet, set intentions, and get rewards for real-world wellness goals. It’s built on positive reinforcement, which makes it oddly addictive in a healthy way.

For something more structured and research-backed, **BeFreed** is a total sleeper hit. It’s an AI-powered learning app that turns books, expert podcasts, and real-life success stories into bite-sized learning paths tailored to your goals. The cool part? You pick how deep you want to go, 10, 20, or 40 minute episodes, and choose the host voice you vibe with. It even tracks what you’re drawn to over time and adapts your roadmap as you evolve. It’s like having a personal coach who’s also a podcast nerd. It’s built by cognitive scientists from Columbia. And yes, it covers all the books I just mentioned, Atomic Habits, Power of Habit, and more. Plus it makes it ridiculously easy to translate ideas like habit stacking into your real life.

Stack smart. Keep it small. Pair it with fun.

- Send messages to your contacts: For example, “Send a message to Bruce to ask for gift ideas,” if Bruce is saved in your contacts.

- Locate a place: Find places in your phone’s map by asking naturally, such as “Locate the nearest shopping mall on my phone.”

- Start navigation in the map app (supported by select Samsung devices): You can simply ask Copilot, “Navigate to the coffee shop using my phone.”

- Cancel a timer or an alarm (supported by select Samsung devices): You can also ask Copilot to help cancel timers or alarms with simple queries, such as “Stop the timer for boiling eggs,” or “Cancel the 7am alarm.”

I’m doing all of that. May start ivabradine for high pulse. But the doctor also suggested fludrocortisone- as it’s a steroid I’m concerned about weight gain. I don’t always gain weight on meds but when I do it’s 40,50, 60 pounds so not just a small amount. 

She also suggested low dose naltrexone to reduce over all system inflammation. 

Has anyone had experience with fludrocortisone and naltrexone? Have they helped? Specifically fludrocortisone without weight gain?

For reference I went from 120lb then did the depo shot for 6 months and gained 60 pounds. I couldn’t get the weight down after stopping even with drinking only black coffee, water and eating salads for dinner and running. Eventually tried Wellbutrin for depression that helped me lose weight. Had insurance issues then when I went back to the doctor she put me on Zoloft and gained 40 pounds. Again hard to get weight down without other meds. ",1,1761445160.0,POTS,1,0.99,False

Posting here feels a little weird but also kind of exciting. I (26M) have been in Bangalore for a while now, and after a year of healing from a 5-year relationship that ended last year, I think I’m finally ready to put myself out there again.

About me: I work in software industry, love exploring new cafes around the city, long drives, late-night music sessions, and good food. I’d like to think I’m thoughtful, grounded, and pretty good at listening.

I’m based in Bangalore and planning to start a small RC Racing Cars experience café — with 2–3 indoor tracks, casual racing sessions, and a small tea/coffee/snacks zone.

I’m completely new to this business, but very passionate about RC racing. I already explored vendors like BharathHobby, Marque, and a few others, but still need real guidance about:

• Reliable sources for cars, tracks, and controllers
• Typical setup cost and space layout
• Maintenance / parts availability in India
• Any Bangalore-based RC communities or professionals who can help me build it

If anyone here has experience running or setting up RC tracks (even hobby-level), I’d really appreciate your guidance or connections.

Thanks in advance 🙏 — I’ll share updates as I progress so others can learn too!

So just a anecdote, I've been really low the last year losing my father, went back to eating sugary foods and drinks, and going into work has been tougher than usual, no energy and sleep disruption, you name it. 

  
It's a bit funny because I started on nights in 2010 and had a coworker who was really overweight and they were trying to get healthier by eating only soup but noticed they were eating chips on breaks.    15 years later, I'm in their position, extra weight, sugary drinks, etc.

The potential of getting kidney stones is probably my biggest fear.   My father had it and it was painful as hell.

  
Hope this message reaches some of you and makes you reconsider your diet and routine.

1og8tm5,https://youtu.be/TBDYlp_-J28,4 Very Scary TRUE Rainy Day Road Trip Horror Stories,"# ""The Silent Tail"":

I was behind the wheel that evening, guiding our old station wagon south through relentless rain, my family tucked into the warm cocoon of worn upholstery and blankets. Laura sat beside me, a map spread across her knees under the dashboard’s weak glow, the pages wrinkled from years of road trips. In the back, our kids—Emma, ten, and her little brother Danny, eight—were tucked against each other, finally asleep after a long day of excitement. We had left Texas after lunch and crossed into Mexico around midnight, immigration lights fading behind us like a final glimpse of safety.

The desert on either side was nothing but a black ocean. No towns. No billboards. No lights beyond our own. The rain hammered down harder the farther we drove, as though something behind the storm was pushing us south.

Laura tilted the dim map toward the light, tracing our path. “Still on Highway 85,” she murmured, reassuring herself more than me. “Two, three hours until Monterrey.”

“Yeah,” I said, though the thought of two more hours in this storm made me grip the wheel harder. Water streaked the windshield so fast the wipers looked useless. The tires hissed over pavement slick like glass.

Behind us, the world was empty.

Until it wasn’t.

Two white points appeared suddenly out of the downpour, distant at first. Then closer. Too close. They had slipped onto the highway from a side road, silent, stalking.

Laura noticed almost immediately. “Another car?” There weren’t supposed to be many travelers this late.

“Just heading the same way,” I said. My voice sounded flat, not convincing enough. I adjusted the mirror. A dark sedan. Couldn’t see much else.

Minutes passed. The sedan stayed glued to us. Never approached to pass. Never fell behind. Just hovered there, matching us perfectly through the darkness.

A small shiver crawled under my collar.

I tried shaking it off. I sped up slightly. The car behind sped up too. I eased off the accelerator. It slowed. My pulse ticked faster.

Emma stirred and sat up, rubbing her eyes. Her hair was stuck to her cheek from sleep. “Dad… why does that car keep following us?”

“We’re fine,” Laura said quickly. Her hand reached back, soothing Emma. I could hear the forced calm in her tone. “Go back to sleep, sweetheart.”

Emma didn’t. She stared behind us, wide-eyed, sensing what we were trying to hide.

The headlights behind flared brighter. The sedan crept closer, close enough that I could make out water spraying off its hood, shimmering in our taillights. The glow filled the wagon, bleaching out colors and making the shadows seem too sharp.

Danny woke with a jerk. “What’s happening?” His voice was small. Threatened.

My instincts screamed that this was wrong. This wasn’t just someone in a hurry. This was someone watching us.

“Maybe they’re just impatient,” I muttered. “I’ll let them pass.”

I drifted to the right side of the lane, waving them by. The sedan followed me rightward, still behind. Not passing. Just waiting.

Then it lunged forward.

It bumped us. A sharp jolt. Not enough to spin us, but enough to send cold fear snapping up my spine.

Laura gasped and grabbed the dash. “Tom! They hit us!”

My teeth clenched. “I know.”

Rain flooded the windshield, blurring everything like I was looking through tears. The tires skidded for half a second, the car fishtailing before I straightened it. Every instinct said not to stop. Not out here in the void.

There were stories about this stretch of road. Stories I had always brushed away as exaggerated whispers meant to scare tourists. Highway bandits. Cars forced off the road. Families robbed, kidnapped, vanished.

Those stories were real now.

Danny whimpered and buried his face in Emma’s side. Emma wrapped her arms around him protectively, the roles reversed in an instant.

“We need a town,” I said. My throat felt tight. “A gas station, anything.”

Laura searched frantically through the map, the pages shaking. “Nothing for miles. Just desert.”

The sedan drew alongside us. Its windows were pitch-black. Rain sheeted across the glass, making it impossible to see who—or what—was inside. It stayed there just long enough for the message to sink in.

They wanted us afraid.

They fell back behind us again like a predator toying with prey before the kill.

The car hit us again. Harder. Laura cried out. The kids screamed.

I yanked the wheel. “Hold on!”

The wagon swayed dangerously. If we slid into the runoff ditch, we’d be trapped with no help for god knows how long… and those people behind us would have all the control they wanted.

Laura’s voice shook. “Tom, they’re trying to run us off the road.”

“I know. I know.” I scanned the darkness feverishly. No headlights in front. No signs. No stations. Just the storm swallowing us whole.

Emma’s words came out trembling. “Dad… are they going to hurt us?”

Her voice cut deeper than any fear I had felt so far.

“No,” I said, trying to sound certain. “I won’t let them.”

Then, like a miracle carving through the rain, a faint shape appeared ahead. A parked vehicle. The silhouette familiar even before I distinguished details.

A police cruiser.

I let out a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding. “There. Thank God.”

I flashed our hazards and eased to the shoulder in front of the cruiser. The sedan slowed, its headlights still on us. For a moment it hovered behind, making me believe they might brazenly stop with us. Then it glided forward and rolled past, disappearing into the watery blackness like it had never been there.

I bolted out into the storm and ran to the cruiser. Rain drenched me instantly, soaking through to my bones. The officer cracked his window, face stern but calm.

“Problema?” he asked.

“Sí… yes,” I said, mixing broken Spanish and desperate breathing. “Un coche… chasing. They hit us. They… too close. Muy peligroso.” Laura jumped in from the passenger seat, helping me explain between gasps.

The officer’s expression hardened. He glanced down the road, his eyes narrowing.

“Sí. Hay ladrones aquí,” he said. Thieves here. “Sometimes they force cars to stop. Or worse.” He nodded toward his ignition. “Los seguiré. I will follow you.”

I didn’t wait to dry off. I sprinted back, climbed inside shaking. “He’s escorting us.”

Laura wrapped her arms around Emma and Danny, who were trembling but safe in that moment. “See? We’re alright,” she whispered, tears blending with rainwater on her cheeks.

The cruiser pulled in behind us, headlights glowing like a shield. We drove again, this time with a guardian just a few feet back. My heartbeat slowly settled, but I didn’t take my eyes off the road. Every shadow felt like a trap ready to spring.

Ten minutes crawled by. The rain softened into a steady pattering. Then Laura stiffened in her seat, pointing ahead with a shaking hand.

On the shoulder, engine off. Lights off. A dark sedan.

The same one.

Waiting.

The officer must have seen it too. His roof lights exploded into blue and red, slicing through the darkness. He accelerated, flying past us, cutting them off with purpose.

I didn’t stop. I didn’t slow. I kept us moving. I didn’t want to see their faces. I didn’t want to find out what would have happened if that cruiser hadn’t been there.

We drove until city lights finally pierced the storm. Civilization. Safety. Life again.

At the outskirts of Monterrey, the officer flashed his lights once, a silent goodbye, and turned back into the stormy desert.

We reached Laura’s parents’ house just before dawn. They opened the door in surprise at our arrival time. Laura and I didn’t tell them everything. Not then. We just held our kids tight and let silence speak for us.

Later, after the children had fallen asleep on the couch and coffee warmed our hands, Laura asked quietly, “What do you think they wanted?”

I stared at the rainy window and felt my pulse still racing like the road was beneath us.

“Maybe our car,” I said. “Maybe our money.” My voice lowered. “Maybe us.”

We never drove that route again. We took buses. We flew. We stayed where crowds lived.

Yet even now, years later, every time I’m behind the wheel on a rainy night and the mirror fills with headlights, something deep inside me coils tight again.

Because once you have been hunted in the dark, the dark never stops watching.



  


# ""No Exit Ahead"":

The engine hummed steadily as Chris and I pushed deeper into the night, the highway stretching empty and black behind us. He fumbled with the radio, flipping through static-laden stations. “Nothing but noise,” he muttered, finally settling on a faint, tinny melody. I didn’t answer. My hands gripped the wheel tight, eyes scanning the slick asphalt. Rain from earlier still shimmered in puddles, hissing under the tires like tiny warnings. We were halfway to his cousin’s place in the next state, but the fuel light blinked insistently.

“Need to stop soon,” I said, voice low.

Chris checked his phone, squinting at the dim screen. “There’s a station a few miles up. Looks open.”

Through the darkness, the gas station appeared like a beacon. Its pumps glowed under harsh white lights, stark against the black surroundings. A few cars were parked, doors closed, silent. It looked normal enough, a haven for weary travelers. I pulled up to the middle pump—the one with the best light.

“I’ll fill up,” I said. “You want to grab some drinks inside?”

Chris nodded and headed toward the small, fluorescent-lit store.

I swiped the card and started pumping. The air was unnervingly still, only the rhythmic click of the nozzle breaking the silence. Then, from the corner of my eye, I saw movement. A tall figure emerged from behind one of the parked cars. At first, I assumed he was another customer. But he walked with deliberate precision, straight toward me.

“Hey,” he called, voice rough, low, almost a growl.

My stomach dropped. He held something in his hand—a gun, aimed low but unmistakable.

Before I could react, two more men appeared. One stepped from the side of the building, another from a car I had thought empty. They moved fast, their eyes cold, locked on me.

“Don’t scream,” the first one said, stepping closer. I saw the scar cutting across his cheek. “Keys and wallet. Now.”

My mind raced. The parked cars weren’t just vehicles—they were props, part of a trap. Chris was inside. I had to think fast.

“Okay, okay,” I said, voice trembling but steady. “The keys are in the ignition. Let me get my friend out first—he’s inside paying.”

The man hesitated, glancing at his partners. “Make it quick. No tricks.”

I nodded, backing slowly toward the car, my heart hammering like a drum. One of them followed, gun raised.

I slid in, whispering as I pretended to call for Chris. My hand hit the ignition. The engine roared to life. The man lunged at the door, but I slammed the accelerator. Tires screamed against wet asphalt as we lurched backward, almost clipping another assailant who cursed and jumped clear. I swung the wheel, gravel spraying, and tore out of the lot.

Chris burst from the store, drinks in hand, eyes wide with confusion. But the attackers were already sprinting toward their own vehicle, one of the supposedly empty cars.

“What happened?” he yelled as I swung into the highway. “Get in! They’re after us!”

Headlights flared in the mirror—dark, aggressive, closing fast.

“They had guns. Tried to rob us. The whole place was a setup,” I shouted.

The sedan pressed close, bumping our rear once, sending a shudder through the car. “Hold on!” I yelled, swerving to avoid another hit. Chris gripped the dashboard, white-knuckled.

“Exit up ahead!” he pointed. “Maybe a town!”

I yanked the wheel, tires squealing, and spotted the warm glow of a small diner on the side road. I dove in, horn blaring. People inside froze, then a couple stepped onto the porch.

The sedan hesitated, slowed, then veered back toward the highway, disappearing into the darkness. We sat there, gasping, hearts hammering, as a man from the diner approached.

“You all right?” he asked.

Chris rushed out a jumbled explanation. The man nodded grimly. “Heard of spots like that—fake busy stations to lure travelers. Better call the cops from here.”

An officer arrived within the hour, took our statements. “Stick to main roads from now on,” he said.

We found a nearby motel, but sleep didn’t come. Every shadow, every distant headlight made my chest tighten. The next morning, we continued the trip cautiously, eyes constantly on the mirrors, wondering if those men were still out there, hunting.

Weeks later, news stories confirmed our worst fears: groups using abandoned stations to ambush drivers, sometimes for cash, sometimes worse. We had been lucky. Not everyone was.



  


# ""The Shortcut"":

I was fifteen, still young enough to believe life could be rewritten overnight. Dancing had always felt like my ticket out. When my parents split, the house turned cold. Meals were silent. The spark in our home was gone. I chased warmth wherever I could find it. For a while I stayed up in the Bay with friends who sketched murals on sidewalks and played guitars around fire escapes. I laughed with them, though I always felt like a guest in someone else’s story. I missed my grandfather in Los Angeles. He used to watch me spin around the living room and call me his “little star.”

One afternoon I decided I could not wait anymore. I stuffed some clothes into a bag, tied my hair in a messy ponytail, and stepped into my scuffed red sneakers. Two guys I had met through friends were also heading south. We figured we could hitch together. The air smelled like exhaust and ocean salt as we stood under a bright sky, thumbs raised.

Cars rushed past without slowing. My feet hurt. I tried to stretch my calves, tried to look confident rather than desperate. Finally a blue van eased onto the shoulder. The paint was faded and dusty. The driver leaned his elbow out the window. He looked about fifty, with sunburned skin and tired eyes.

“You kids headed south?” he asked.

The guys stepped forward. The driver shook his head.

“No room except up front. The girl can come. You boys find another ride.”

Something felt wrong in the pause that followed. One of the guys leaned close enough that I could feel his breath.

“Don’t,” he murmured. “There is something weird about him.”

I should have listened. I should have trusted that prickling feeling under my skin. Instead I looked at the van and thought of my grandfather waiting by his kitchen window. I thought of how close I was to getting home.

“It is only a ride,” I said, trying to sound sure. “I will be fine.”

I climbed in.

“My name is Emily,” I said, shutting the door.

“Call me Larry,” he replied without looking at me. His voice had no warmth in it. Just flat noise.

We headed toward the interstate. Radio static filled the silence until I talked to fill the emptiness. I told him about dance classes and music and how someday I wanted to perform under bright lights in a city that did not feel divided. He nodded once or twice. He said he had been a sailor. He never smiled.

Miles stretched. Familiar signs faded. Asphalt gave way to cracked roads lined with dry weeds. The sun baked the air. I noticed he was veering away from the freeway.

“Los Angeles is not that way,” I said, gripping the seat belt.

“Shortcut,” he muttered. “Trust me.”

My heart thudded. I watched yellow grass blur outside the window. I counted breaths. I planned excuses to get out at the next turn. When he finally slowed near a wide empty patch of desert, hope flickered.

“I need to stretch my legs,” he said, pushing his door open.

I saw the chance. I unbuckled quietly, pretending to fix my shoe. I felt adrenaline flood me. I had one shot.

I ran for it.

The blow came before the scream. A crushing pain exploded at the back of my skull. The ground tilted. I tasted blood. A hammer. Heavy and cold.

“You should not have tried that,” he growled.

The world turned painful and frantic. He dragged me by the hair into the back of the van. I kicked and clawed until my lungs burned. He tied my wrists with rough rope from a toolbox. Every knot bit into my skin. He warned me to stop struggling. His breath smelled like metal and cigarettes.

He drove deeper into nothing. No headlights except our own. No houses. No chance someone would see me.

He stopped in a canyon wide enough to swallow sound. When he climbed into the back with me, his eyes looked empty of anything human. The assaults that followed took pieces of me I can never list. Pain and fear blurred into a long night. I begged. He laughed like he had heard the same plea a hundred times.

When dawn scraped across the sky he decided it was over.

He returned with a hatchet. His voice had the calm you would expect from someone folding laundry.

“This ends now.”

I begged again. Not for my dreams this time. Only for breath, for time, for anything that meant I still existed.

He swung. The shock was louder than the scream. My left arm. Then the right. My world shrank to bright agony and the pounding of my pulse. He spoke while he worked, like he was finishing a chore.

“You do not need these anymore.”

He threw me over the edge of a cliff like garbage. The drop was rough. Rocks skinned my back and legs. Dust clogged my mouth. Every heartbeat spilled more blood into the earth.

I could have given up then. Something inside refused.

I used my teeth to tear strips from my shirt and shoved mud over the stumps to slow the bleeding. I forced my legs beneath me. The cliff wall felt impossible. I climbed anyway. Knees scraping. Muscles screaming. Inch by inch. I climbed because dying down there meant he decided the end of my story.

When I reached the road I must have looked like a ghost. Bare. Blood drenched. Holding what I had left of my arms up so gravity would not take more from me.

The first car slowed. The passengers stared with horror. Then they drove off. Their tires kicked dust into my face.

I kept walking. Each step felt stolen.

A young couple finally stopped. The woman wrapped a blanket around me, hands shaking as she held it closed. I whispered through cracked lips.

“He cut me. Please help.”

They did. That saved me.

The hospital was bright and loud. I drifted in and out as doctors worked to pull me back from the edge. I told the police everything. The scar on his hand. The shape of his nose. The van. He did not get to hide.

A neighbor recognized him from the sketch. He was arrested. In court I sat with heavy prosthetic arms resting on my lap, refusing to look away from him. He leaned close once when guards moved him past me.

“I will finish what I started,” he whispered.

He got fourteen years and served only eight. Freedom came back to him like a reward. My rage became a mission. I built a life anyway. I learned to paint with my feet. I raised two sons. I stood in front of lawmakers and told them that victims deserve better than this. My voice did not shake.

He killed again. A woman in Florida lost her life to the monster I had already survived. They caught him. I faced him in court once more.

“You did not break me,” I told him.

He went to death row. Cancer took him first.

Sometimes I still wake reaching for arms that are gone. I check locks. I avoid lonely highways. Memories arrive whether I want them or not. They always will.

I lost so much in that desert, yet I walked out alive. Surviving will always be my victory.





# ""Eyes in the Storm"":

Anna and I had been talking about this road trip since winter, counting down the days like kids waiting for summer break. We both needed a break from our lives that had started to feel too small. She spent her weekdays in a classroom full of restless teenagers, lessons and grading eating up her nights. I spent mine under fluorescent lights, glued to a computer screen, convincing myself each weekend that “next week will be better.” A few days on the Pacific coast sounded like just enough freedom to breathe again.

We packed the car the night before. Snacks piled high in the back seat: chips, gummies, trail mix, and enough water bottles to float a canoe. Anna insisted we bring paper maps “for the aesthetic,” though secretly we both knew it was in case the GPS died somewhere out in the middle of nowhere. We joked that we were prepared for both a cute beach picnic and the apocalypse.

We left before sunrise, the sky still purple and the city quiet. Music played low, something upbeat that matched the energy of starting fresh. Anna drummed her fingers on the steering wheel. Every mile we put behind us made us feel lighter.

Hours later, the world changed.

Dark clouds crawled over the mountains and merged into a heavy, churning sheet of storm. Rain hammered the car without mercy, loud enough to challenge the music. Wind shoved us sideways from time to time. Buildings vanished. So did other cars. The highway cut through the emptiest part of Idaho, flat and exposed, nothing but fences and endless fields beaten down by weather.

Anna leaned in close to the windshield, her knuckles white against the steering wheel. “This is bad. I can barely see the road lines.”

I turned down the volume and squinted through the dark. Water sloshed across the asphalt as though the highway had transformed into a long river. We passed a sign for the next town, but the letters blurred into streaks of white.

“We should pull over,” Anna said. Her voice carried tension she rarely showed. She was usually the fearless one.

I scanned ahead. “There’s an overpass coming up. We can wait it out a bit.”

The concrete structure rose out of the gray haze like something from a nightmare. No lights. No cars. Just a patch of dry pavement sheltered from the rain’s rage. Anna eased us underneath and parked. The sudden quiet was eerie, like stepping out of the storm and into a vacuum.

She shut off the engine. We could still hear the storm crashing around us, but the roof overhead muted it enough to breathe again.

“Maybe twenty minutes?” Anna said, reaching behind her for a bag of chips.

“Sounds good.” I forced a smile. “Then back to sunshine and ocean air.”

She laughed softly, though the worry lingered in her eyes.

Lightning flashed.

The whole world lit up in harsh, white light. And in that instant, I saw something crouched low beside the front passenger tire. A dark shape, human-shaped, but twisted strangely close to the pavement like it was trying to merge with the shadows.

My breath caught. I blinked, telling myself it must have been my imagination. “Did you see anything just now?”

Anna shook her head while crunching on a chip. “See what? Rain monsters?”

Another flash, brighter. Illuminating everything for a solid second.

The figure didn’t move. It hugged the side of the tire, shoulders hunched, fingers pressed deliberately against the rubber. A person. Too close. Too silent.

“Anna…” I whispered. “There’s someone outside.”

She dropped the chip bag. “Where?”

“Right there. Next to the tire.”

She leaned forward, eyes narrowed. “I don’t see anything.”

The next flash erased any chance it was a trick of the light.

The hand—long, pale fingers—pushed something sharp into our tire. Not one thing. Several. Quick, practiced motion. Like this wasn’t the first time.

My chest tightened. “Hey!” I yelled, but my voice came out tight.

There was no response. The figure didn’t flinch, didn’t look up.

That was wrong. People look up when you yell. People react.

“Start the car,” I said. My voice tried to stay steady, but fear frayed the edges.

Anna fumbled with the keys, eyes darting from me to the darkness. “What is he doing? Is he trying to help us?”

“He’s doing the exact opposite.”

The engine started with a growl. Headlights flared outward. The space beside the tire was empty. Completely empty. Like the storm had swallowed the person whole.

Anna didn’t wait for me to decide. She pulled out from under the overpass, putting distance between us and that concrete shelter.

We drove. Quiet. Listening to the storm and our breathing.

“That was probably just someone hiding from the weather,” Anna said after a minute. The doubt in her voice was impossible to miss. “Right?”

“Then why the tire?” I whispered.

Neither of us had an answer.

Miles passed. The storm eased into heavy drizzle. The world looked washed-out and exhausted. We dared to think it might just be our nerves.

Then it started. A soft thump.

Thump.

Thump.

Anna stiffened. “That’s a flat.”

My pulse kicked up. “Pull over somewhere safe.”

We slowed onto the wide shoulder near an exit sign. The rain pattered around us, lighter now but cold, sending tiny chills up my arms.

I crouched beside the rear tire and spotted them immediately.

Four nails. Thick. Long. Driven in with intention, equal spacing like they’d been measured. Not some accident from debris on the road.

Anna crouched next to me. “Oh my god.”

“This was planned.” I pulled one free carefully. The rubber hissed with released pressure. “He wanted us to break down farther from shelter. Alone.”

Her voice trembled. “Why? To rob us? To… something worse?”

I didn’t want to say the possibilities out loud.

We worked fast, changing the tire while the storm buzzed overhead. Every sound made us jerk our heads up. A truck driving by. A branch hitting a metal sign. Even the wind felt like something watching us.

Anna whispered, “We’re being hunted.”

I didn’t correct her.

Back on the road, the spare tire rattled on the slick asphalt. Neither of us said a word. We didn’t want to voice the fear crawling under our skin.

A gas station appeared up ahead, a tiny oasis lit by flickering fluorescent lights, surrounded by nothingness.

Inside, the air smelled like coffee that had been sitting too long. The lone clerk, an older man with a beard and tired eyes, listened to our story with increasing seriousness.

“Nails in the tire,” he repeated slowly. “Under an overpass. Storm bad enough to force a stop.”

He spat the toothpick into a small trash bin. “You two are lucky.”

Anna swallowed. “Lucky?”

He leaned forward, voice dropping. “There’s a group working the highways. Storms like this help them. Make you stop, make you vulnerable. At first they’d just rob folks, but lately…” He hesitated, chewing on the next words like they tasted bitter. “People have gone missing. Cars found days later. Doors left open. Phones on the seats.”

The ground seemed to tilt for a moment. My stomach dropped.

“You’re serious?” I said.

He nodded. “We tell every traveler who stops here: stay on main roads. Don’t pull over anywhere isolated. If something else goes wrong, keep driving until you reach people, not emptiness.”

We thanked him and rushed back to the car, scanning every shadow before getting inside. Even the gas-pump light overhead felt like a weak guardian barely keeping the dark at bay.

Back on the highway. Another fault revealed itself—an engine warning light blinking on and off like a heartbeat out of rhythm.

“Not now,” Anna whispered.

We coasted to a careful stop, terrified but with no choice. I popped the hood. The engine hissed with cooling moisture. Then I saw it.

A disconnected wire. Freshly disturbed.

Someone had planned for a second breakdown.

Someone wanted us stuck.

Headlights glowed behind us, creeping closer.

A dark truck rolled to a slow stop. No markings. Tinted windows. The engine purred like a predator studying prey.

A tall figure stepped out, hood up, face hidden.

“You folks need help?” The voice was calm. Too calm. He took a step closer.

Anna honked once, a sharp warning.

“We’re fine!” I forced volume into my voice. “Just leaving!”

“Storm’s dangerous. Tires get tricky,” he replied. He knew exactly what to mention.

Anna screamed my name. I slammed the hood shut and dove into the car. She hit the gas. The spare tire skidded, caught, and launched us forward.

The truck followed.

No headlights in the side mirror looked farther away. If anything, they seemed to gain on us whenever the road dipped into darkness.

Anna kept driving. Hands shaking. Whispering, “Please stop following us. Please stop.”

Finally, as we approached faint lights from a small town, the truck suddenly turned off down some dirt road and vanished like it had never existed.

We didn’t stop until we reached a motel. The lobby lights felt like the first safe place in hours. We locked the door behind us, called the police, reported everything. An officer nodded grimly and said he had heard stories like ours too many times lately.

“You two were smart,” he said. “Most people trust help when they’re scared.”

We stayed awake most of the night. Every sound outside—every car door, every rumble of thunder—made our nerves spike.

The next morning, we decided the coast could wait. We stuck to highways and bustling towns on the way home. No scenic detours. No quiet stops.

Even now, we talk about it sometimes. How easily we could have been another unsolved report. Another empty car left behind.

We used to think the scariest part of a storm was the weather.

Now we know the real danger can move low to the ground, silent as a shadow, waiting for the moment you let your guard drop.",1,1761443937.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1og8qrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/1og8qrq/ai_doesnt_just_automate_jobs_it_automates/,AI doesn't just automate jobs; it automates meaning-making pathways.,"What distinguishes needs from wants? Needs are often considered for survival, whereas wants aren’t necessary for survival. Abrahaman Maslow proposed mid 20th century that we have a hierarchy of needs. Beginning at Physiological, then Safety, Love and Belonging, Esteem, Self-actualisation, and Self-Transcendence.

https://preview.redd.it/qjl7h1564dxf1.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=139d2c93dcc17e00853605479fdd148bac74ee7c

It was often assumed that this model was hierarchical, that we must satisfy the lower needs before we can serve the higher needs. Though this notion has been widely debunked. As we can imagine a starving artist, without accommodation, not knowing where their next meal is coming from, disconnected from society, solely focused on producing their art, in self-actualising.

But what if these needs are hierarchical? Not as originally understood in terms of urgency or priority of needs. Rather, the hierarchy is an inversion of the pyramid. The boundary represents what distinguishes a need from a want.

https://preview.redd.it/659ttmh74dxf1.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=7421f72d31cc68ff0fc90a0281291f83e4f5db9b

Each level has a Minimum Viable Threshold (MVT) that defines the *need*. Everything beyond that MVT is a *want*.

**Need (White Area):** The MVT. This is the minimum required to ""meet"" the need.

**Want (Blue Area):** Desires *beyond* the MVT.

**The Inversion:** Basic needs (like food, shelter, warmth) have a *small* MVT, leaving vast room for the pursuit of wants (gourmet food, a mansion, perfect temperature control, etc.). Whereas higher needs (like Self-Actualization) have a *massive* MVT, as the ""need"" is the entire journey of becoming your best self.

Think about a person wanting to become the world’s best swimmer. To do so, they must self-actualise, practice daily, be strict with their diet, push their limits, compete, and compare themselves in competition with their peers. The majority of their journey is in pursuit of self-actualisation, the sliver of a “want” is to attain a subjective label of “being the world’s best swimmer”.

A question arises, then, why are esteem, self-actualisation, and self-transcendence activities mostly considered “needs” rather than “wants”?

Another perspective shift is needed; rather than looking inward out (from me toward society), we need to look outward in (from society to me). All the cells that make us up have a purpose, such that we can go about our day. When we seek purpose, it's more often than not relational. What are we offering our group, our community, or society more broadly? I serve people coffee, I clean other people's houses, I produce people’s food, I create spreadsheets to organise data, I enact laws to ensure social cohesion, I enforce laws to ensure social cohesion, etc.

This inversion of Maslow’s Hierarchy shifts the question from “what do I need?” as an individual to “what do I need given my position in society?”. In terms of society, we don’t need much to meet our physiological needs. I need clean air, a meal a day, and clean water. Anything more is a want. This isn’t to say that wants are bad in any way. But the undertone of this article suggests that the pursuit of needs feels meaningful, the pursuit of wants shallow.

Our transcendence is our connection to something greater. Imagine a heart cell that doesn't feel connected to the body. We don’t have the same physical connection the cells in our body have to each other; we have a meta-physical connection, relationships, and a sense of belonging. Our relationships are defined by time spent with others, shared experiences, favours given, and received. Transcendence is about helping others and feeling connected to something bigger, which is often why we seek self-transcendence through religious belonging. Once we became self-aware, we wondered about our origin and our future.

Though, this connection, this belonging to something greater than ourselves, our ability to serve others, is built upon our capacity to self-actualise. To fulfill our potential.

Our current society seems to keep people locked in a cycle of horizontal expansion, where their needs are met, so they perpetually exist in pursuit of wants. Negating their pursuit vertically to ascend the hierarchy and to build capabilities and capacities that they can offer back to society.

This ties back to the Title: we find greater meaning in the pursuit of needs, not wants. Perhaps explaining the miserable millionaire. Those who can buy anything they want but feel unhappy because they have superficial relationships; having self-actualised in one way (their craft), they plateau, no longer in pursuit of discovering what else they can offer the world, or who they might be outside of their skill. Resting on their laurels, immersed in their every desire, rather than experiencing the grind of “becoming”. They remain deeply unhappy.

If we do find meaning in service of these needs, then AI and Automation are about to create a profound meaning crisis the likes of which this world has never seen.

When AI can do everything humans can do, and better. It will hijack our needs system. What is our purpose? It will push everyone into self-actualisation, whether they’re ready or not.

Though new needs, new purposes might emerge.

* **Witness-bearing** \- being the consciousness that experiences what AI creates
* **Meaning-making** \- interpreting and contextualizing AI's outputs for human souls
* **Relationship-deepening** \- the irreplaceable work of human-to-human soul connection
* **Wisdom-cultivation** \- not knowledge (AI has that) but embodied understanding
* **Sacred play** \- creation for its own sake, sports, games, art as ritual, not product

**AI is about to force us to become more human (to self-actualise and transcend) precisely when our consumerist wants-driven society has meant we've forgotten how**.

If serving our needs is where we’re hard-wired to create meaning, then gone are the days of coding bootcamps; the dawn of meaning-making bootcamps is here. We teach people to recognize and serve others through helping them to actualize their potential without the need for economic validation.

Otherwise, we face billions of stranded individuals unhappily existing in a wants playground, spiritually starving amid material abundance.",2,1761443696.0,JordanPeterson,0,1.0,False

1og8l59,https://i.redd.it/uyj6tk27ycxf1.jpeg,"Breakfast of Champions (Little Book, The Infinite I & II side by side)","It was a quiet, rainy morning so I thought I'd spend a little ""me time"" in my office with some pancakes, bacon, coffee, and a couple of friends: Little Book, The Infinite batches I and II.

I was really excited last year by the expansion of Freddie Noe's Little Book series into a project that incorporated whiskeys of different ages from him (7 years), his father (14 years), and grandfather (20 years), along with a family distillation (8 years), with 30% of the total production being held back for future iterations. It is interesting to note that this reserved portion was placed in a tank, rather than being barreled, effectively placing it in suspended animation.

This year's bottling again includes whiskeys from all three generations, with a 22 year from Booker, a 10 year from Freddie, and another 7 year from Freddie, along with another 8 year family batch, and the reserved 30% of the first batch (I haven't seen it confirmed that they included the entire reserved portion, but I don't see any reason for them not to, given the nature of the project). This time Freddie's whiskey went through ""extended fermentation"" above the 72-96 hour Beam whiskeys usually experience, which can lend itself to what I perceive as a creaminess in the mouthfeel, whether as a result of the spent yeast becoming dissolved solids or some other conversion process that takes place (maybe similar to malolactic fermentation in winemaking). So this whiskey is a blend of 22, 20, 14, two different 7,  two different 8 year whiskeys along with the reserved batch 1. That's quite a combo.  How do they stack up against each other? Both rested 10 minutes, the batch 1 in a glencairn and the batch 2 in a Spieglau whiskey snifter, which has become my favorite tasting glass of late.

Infinite Batch I:

Nose: Loads of cinnamon and christmas baking scents, vanilla bean pod, dark fruit around the edges, with a toasted nuttiness and creamy oak hanging like a velvet curtain at the back of the stage. A dark burnished copper in the glass with lovely legs descending after a swirl.

Palate: Rich, punchy, and unctious. Loads of roasted peanut and candied nuts, Mexican hot chocolate, shortbread, caramel,  and varnished oak.

Finish: This one hangs around and hangs around swerving between spice, oak, and heat. Sipping this whiskey reminds me of my great grandma Ross's kitchen during the holidays: warm, comforting, with something in the oven. It made my top 5 last year and revisiting it only confirms its spot.

Infinite Batch II:

Nose: Less spice and fruit at first, but more as it sat and opened, vanilla frosting, tobacco drying barn or cigar wrapper leaf, and toffee peanuts. If anything, it is more dark and brooding than its predecessor.

Palate: Incredibly rich mouthfeel, cinnamon candies, black plum skin, and caramel suspended from a tent pole of toasted redskin peanuts. One of the predominant notes for me is of baked custard, but not creme brulee, more like the french Canale pastry, with its baked and caramelized exterior and lightly structured custard interior (seriously, go to St. Honore Boulangerie on NW Thurman and have one). 

Finish: Fading echoes of the palate. Candied nuts, caramel, and drying, linear oak. This is such a well thought out and constructed bourbon and a tremedous follow up to the original. 

This more than stands up to the first bottle and will again be in my top 5 whiskeys of the year. It's an admirable project and I look forward to how this whiskey evolves in the future. ",11,1761443240.0,pdxwhisky,0,1.0,False
1og8ky9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1og8ky9/ha_gayy_2/,HA! Gayy #2,"The next day was a Saturday, and the world was gray and cold. The truck, Silas's ancient, beloved, perpetually in need of repair '89 F150, was making a noise. It was a faint, metallic shing shing shing that I couldn't have picked out over the engine's normal rumble, but Silas had heard it the second he’d turned the key.
His jaw had tightened. ""Alternator bearing,"" he’d muttered, more to the truck than to me.
Which is how I found myself in the passenger seat, nursing a lukewarm coffee, as we drove to the industrial side of town. Silas didn't buy his parts at the shiny, branded chain stores. He went to a dusty, cavernous warehouse called ""Gus's Auto Salvage,"" where the man behind the counter had known him since he’d first rolled into town.
The truck's cab was another one of his paradoxes. The outside was faded blue and primer gray, with a dent in the fender I’d never asked about. But the inside, the bench seat, was immaculate. There was no trash, no old coffee cups. Just a copy of The Aeneid on the dash and the faint smell of engine grease and pine.
The radio was on, tuned to an old school country station. Johnny Cash was singing about a ring of fire. Silas hummed along, a low, tuneless sound, his scarred hands steady on the wheel.
I loved these stupid, mundane errands. I loved watching him in his element.
We pulled up to the warehouse. ""Won't be a minute,"" he said.
""I'm coming,"" I said, already opening my door. I'd rather stand in a cold garage than sit in the truck alone.
He gave me a sideways look but didn't argue.
The moment we stepped inside, the atmosphere changed. The air smelled of oil and old metal. A large, grizzled man in greasy overalls looked up from a counter.
""Silas! Hell, I figured that was your truck,"" the man, Gus, boomed. ""Don't you ever buy a new one?""
""Nothin' new worth buyin',"" Silas replied, leaning an elbow on the counter. The redneck was in full effect now. The drawl was thicker, his posture more relaxed. ""You got that alternator for an '89 5.0?""
""Think I got a rebuilt one in the back. Who's your friend?"" Gus asked, nodding at me.
""This is Asa. He holds the wrenches,"" Silas said, without a flicker of humor.
Gus laughed. ""Good man. Hold 'em tight.""
I gave a weak smile, feeling intensely out of place. This was Silas's world. A world of men who understood engines, who spoke in part numbers. I was a guy who worked a data entry job and couldn't change his own oil.
Silas and Gus talked shop for a few minutes, a language I didn't understand. I wandered over to a barrel full of old gaskets, pretending to be interested. I was used to this. I was Silas's quiet, unassuming roommate. His shadow.
""Found it!"" Gus yelled from a back room, emerging with a heavy, metal object. ""Seventy five bucks.""
Silas pulled a worn leather wallet from his back pocket and paid in cash. ""Appreciate it, Gus.""
""Anytime, son. You keep that thing runnin'.""
We walked back out into the gray light, Silas carrying the new alternator like it was nothing.
""He seems nice,"" I said, climbing back into the truck.
""Gus is alright,"" Silas said. He put the part on the floorboard and started the engine. The shing shing shing was still there, a patient complaint.
""So,"" I said, trying to fill the silence as we drove. ""That's it? You just... swap it?""
""That's it.""
""Will it take long?""
He shrugged. ""Couple hours.""
""Cool.""
The silence settled back in, but it was the comfortable kind. The kind I was used to. The Johnny Cash station played a mournful song about a man in a bar. I leaned my head against the cold window, watching the drab buildings slide by, and I felt... content. Just being here, with him, was enough.
It was a dangerous feeling.
My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was our friend, Chloe. She was bubbly, kind, and relentlessly social. She was also the only person who seemed to occupy a space in both my world and Silas's, and she was blissfully, completely oblivious to the tension between us.
Chloe: Coffee? I'm at The Grind!
I showed the phone to Silas. ""Chloe wants to get coffee.""
He just glanced at it and nodded. ""Alright.""
The Grind was the opposite of Gus's. It was all exposed brick, reclaimed wood, and the smell of burnt espresso. It was packed with college students and young professionals. Chloe was at a small table by the window, waving frantically.
""Asa! Si! Hi!"" she chirped, jumping up to hug us. I accepted the hug. Silas, as usual, just gave a small nod, his hands shoved deep in his pockets. He hated being touched unexpectedly.
""How are you guys? Si, you're covered in... grease,"" she said, wrinkling her nose.
""Truck,"" Silas offered, already moving to the counter. ""Want anything?"" he asked me.
""Just a black coffee,"" I said. He nodded and went to order, his broad back a sudden, solid wall between us and the rest of the cafe. He always seemed to take up more space than anyone else.
""Okay, spill,"" Chloe said, grabbing my arm and pulling me into a chair. ""How was the date with what's his name? Mark?""
""It was fine,"" I said, the same, tired line.
""Just 'fine'?"" she pouted. ""Asa, you have to try.""
""I am trying,"" I sighed.
""No, you're not. You're... I don't know. You're always waiting for something."" She leaned in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""Which is why I'm so excited. I met this guy last night at trivia, and he is perfect for you.""
My stomach sank. ""Oh, Chloe, I don't know...""
""No, shut up, listen! He's a graphic designer, he loves hiking, he's actually emotionally available, and he asked if I had any cute, single friends.""
I was already shaking my head, a cold dread seeping into me. ""I'm not really in a place to date...""
""What place? You're in a paying rent and being sad place. You need to get out!"" she insisted. ""I already gave him your number. He's going to text you. His name is Ben. Be nice!""
I wanted to crawl under the table. I hated this. I hated being set up. I hated the expectation, the inevitable disappointment. I hated...
I looked up. Silas was walking back, two black coffees in hand. His expression was unreadable. He hadn't heard the conversation, but I knew, with that witch certainty, that he knew exactly what was happening.
He set my coffee in front of me. His fingers brushed mine. I flinched, pulling my hand back.
He didn't sit. He just stood by the table, a silent, commanding mountain of a man.
""What's wrong?"" Chloe asked, finally sensing the shift. ""Si? You good?""
""We gotta go,"" Silas said. His voice was flat. Dead. ""Gotta fix the truck.""
""Oh,"" Chloe said, deflating. ""Okay. Well, it was good to see you! Asa, text me! And answer Ben!""
""Yeah,"" I mumbled, grabbing my coffee. ""See you, Chlo.""
I followed Silas out, his long, purposeful strides forcing me to almost jog to keep up. We got in the truck and he peeled out of the parking lot, his driving just on the aggressive side of legal.
The silence in the truck was not comfortable. It was cold. It was angry.
I was angry, too. At Chloe, for her meddling. At myself, for being a coward. And, ridiculously, at Silas, for just... being.
We drove for ten minutes in that thick, glacial silence. The country station was playing a commercial for a tractor supply store.
""What's your problem?"" I finally snapped, the words out before I could stop them.
He didn't look at me. He just kept his eyes on the road.
""Seriously, Silas. What's wrong? You were fine two minutes ago.""
He turned onto our street, the truck lurching.
""Was it something I said?"" I pushed. ""Something Chloe said? What, did I offend you? You don't like graphic designers?""
He parked the truck, yanking the emergency brake. He turned the key. The engine died, and the ensuing silence was absolute.
He still didn't look at me. He just stared through the windshield.
""Silas. Talk to me, dammit.""
He let out a slow, measured breath. He turned, and in the cab's dim, gray light, his eyes were dark.
""You don't want a graphic designer, Asa.""
The words hit me like a physical blow. It was the same tone he’d used about my last date. That flat, prophetic certainty.
""You don't know what I want,"" I shot back, my voice shaking. ""You don't know anything.""
""I know that,"" he said, his voice quiet, but with an edge I’d never heard before. It was rough. It was... hurt.
""How?"" I whispered, my anger deflating, replaced by a terrible, familiar dread. ""How do you know what I want?""
He held my gaze, and I felt like he was reading every pathetic, desperate thought in my head. He was a witch. He was an enigma. And he was my best friend.
""Because,"" he said, and his voice was so low I barely heard it. ""You want what you've already got.""
He opened his door, grabbed the alternator, and got out of the truck, leaving me in the cab, my heart hammering against my ribs, my world completely and irrevocably undone.",2,1761443223.0,Informal_Effect,0,1.0,False

1og8jjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1og8jjo/ha_gayy/,HA! Gayy,"The only sound in our tiny, overpriced apartment was the fssst of Silas opening another bottle of cheap lager. He used a vintage Zippo as an opener, one he’d probably found in the glovebox of his truck, and the metal cap clinked onto the cluttered coffee table, sliding to a stop against a dense, hardback copy of Swann's Way.
That was Silas. He was sprawled in the worn-out floral armchair we’d rescued from the curb, one scuffed, steel-toed boot dangling over the arm. His flannel was soft from a decade of wear, sleeves rolled to his forearms, revealing corded muscle, a dusting of freckles, and a smudge of what looked like motor oil. He was reading Proust and drinking a PBR.
He was, I’d long ago decided, a walking, talking, god honest paradox.
I was on the lumpy sofa, laptop open but ignored, nursing my own beer and just... watching him. It was my favorite and most painful habit.
Silas Gray was the most taciturn man I’d ever met, yet his presence was a tangible thing. It filled every corner of our 600 square foot apartment. When he was home, the space felt grounded, safe. When he was out, at the garage where he worked, or just gone, as he sometimes was, the apartment felt like a hollow, empty box.
He was my best friend.
And I was, to put it mildly, completely and devastatingly screwed.
Because you're not supposed to fall in love with your best friend. It’s a cliché. It’s messy. And you're definitely not supposed to fall in love with a best friend who is a paradoxical enigma, a man who built his walls so high you couldn't even be sure what was on the other side.
He was a gay redneck. An intellectual sweetheart. He was sophisticated and, in the same breath, utterly assbackwards.
He could spend an afternoon meticulously rebuilding the carburetor on his '89 Ford, knuckles bleeding, cussing in a low monotone, and then spend the evening listening to a Shostakovich string quartet, his eyes closed in concentration. He owned more flannel shirts than I owned t-shirts, but he also owned a pristine, tailored wool coat he’d bought at a thrift store and restored by hand.
He was, I’d also decided, profoundly, unconventionally attractive. His profile was all sharp angles, a strong nose that had been broken at least once, a stubborn jawline that was perpetually dusted with scruff, high cheekbones. But his mouth, when he wasn't pressing it into a flat line of concentration, was surprisingly soft. His hair was a shaggy brown mess he never bothered to style, and his eyes... well, his eyes were the worst part.
They were a clear, startling hazel, and they saw everything.
I must have been staring, my thoughts practically screaming, because he looked up. Just lifted his gaze from the page. He didn't speak. He just pinned me to the sofa, raising one perfect, questioning eyebrow.
What?
My stomach did a stupid, agonizing flip. My skin went hot. This was the other thing. The ""witch"" thing. He could read me like a book. He could read anyone like a book. It was unnerving.
""Just..."" I mumbled, looking away, grabbing for my beer. ""Thinking.""
A ghost of a smile touched his lips. He hadn't moved. ""You're thinkin' too loud, Asa.""
His voice was another contradiction. A low, gentle rumble with a soft, Appalachian drawl he’d never quite lost, even though we were three states away from the mountains he’d grown up in.
""Sorry,"" I said, trying for casual. ""Just stressing about the electric bill.""
It was a lie, but a plausible one. I was the one who handled the bills, the groceries, the running of the household. Silas just existed. He’d leave his share of the rent in cash on the kitchen counter on the first of every month, never a day late, never with a word.
He held my gaze for another second, and I knew he didn't buy it. He knew it was a lie, but he let it go. He dropped his eyes back to his book, taking a long pull from his beer. The moment passed, but the tension remained, thrumming in the air between us.
He was not someone you forgot. And I was the idiot who had to live with him.
I sighed, finally closing my laptop. ""I'm making pasta. You want any?""
""Sure.""
I escaped to the kitchen, which was really just a glorified hallway with a sink. The small space felt safer. I could focus on the mundane: boiling water, chopping an onion. I put on some music, something loud and indie and distracting, filling the silence he’d left.
I was halfway through dicing a tomato when my thoughts, inevitably, drifted back to him. To last week. I’d gone on a date. A perfectly nice guy from a dating app. We’d had drinks. It was fine.
When I got home, Silas was in his usual spot, reading.
""How was it?"" he’d asked, not looking up.
""Fine. He was nice.""
Silas had turned a page. ""You're not goin' out with him again.""
It wasn't a question.
""Why not?"" I’d snapped, more defensive than I meant to be.
He’d finally looked up then, his hazel eyes flat. ""He bored you.""
And the worst part? The absolute worst part? He was right. I was bored. But Silas knowing it, just knowing it from a single glance, made me feel exposed.
""You're a witch,"" I’d muttered, throwing my keys on the counter.
""And you're a bad liar,"" he’d replied, turning back to his book.
The memory made my hand clumsy. The knife slipped, biting into the side of my thumb. Not deep, but deep enough.
""Shit,"" I hissed, yanking my hand back, blood welling up instantly. I stuck it under the tap, the cold water stinging.
The music was still playing, the water was running. There was no way he could have heard.
A shadow fell over me.
I froze. He was there, right behind me. His commanding presence was suddenly overwhelming in the narrow kitchen. He was close enough that I could feel the warmth radiating off him, smell the faint, clean scent of iron and soap that always clung to him.
""Move,"" he said, his voice quiet.
I stepped aside, still clutching my hand. He turned off the water. His movements were economical, precise. He grabbed the dish towel, and before I could protest, he took my hand.
His grip was firm. His hands were what you’d expect: calloused, the knuckles scarred, fingernails permanently stained despite his meticulous scrubbing. But his touch was... gentle. Unbelievably gentle.
He wrapped the towel around my thumb, applying firm, steady pressure. He didn’t say anything. He just stood there, holding my hand, his head bent in concentration. I could see the whorl of his hair at his crown, the strong line of his neck.
My heart was not doing a stupid flip. It was doing a full on, terrified Olympic tumble.
I was breathing him in. I was standing in my kitchen, bleeding on a dish towel, and I was so in love I couldn't even think. I wanted to lean forward, just an inch, and rest my head on his shoulder. I wanted to see what he would do.
He held the pressure for a long minute, the silence stretching, pulling taut. The only sound was the thump thump thump of the bass from my stereo.
""It's not bad,"" he said, his voice low. ""But it'll need a butterfly.""
He let go of my wrist, and the loss of contact was a physical ache. He turned, walked into our tiny bathroom, and I heard the medicine cabinet squeak open. I just stood there, my hand throbbing, my entire body trembling.
How do you do this? How do you live with this?
He came back with a small first aid kit. He opened it on the counter, pulling out an antiseptic wipe and two butterfly bandages.
""Gimme,"" he ordered, and I held out my hand again, like a goddamn offering.
He unwrapped the towel. The bleeding had mostly stopped. He took the antiseptic wipe and, with that same impossible gentleness, cleaned the cut. I flinched, but his other hand was already on my wrist, holding me steady.
""Hold still, Asa.""
His thumb was warm against my pulse. He was so close. His focus was absolute, as if my stupid little cut was the most important problem in the world. He was an intellectual sweetheart. He was a paradox. And I was falling, falling, falling.
He applied the bandages with the same precision he’d probably used on that carburetor. His fingers brushed mine, and it was electric.
""There,"" he said, his work complete. He didn't meet my eyes. He just started packing up the kit.
""Thanks,"" I whispered. My voice was hoarse.
He just nodded, closing the kit with a snap.
The moment was over. He’d patched me up, and now he would retreat. He would go back to his chair, and I would go back to my pasta, and we would pretend that my entire world hadn't just tilted on its axis.
""Si,"" I said, before I could stop myself.
He paused, halfway back to the living room. He turned, his face half in shadow. ""Yeah?""
I had no idea what I was going to say. I love you. You scare me. Why do you know everything? Please don't ever leave.
""The... the water's boiling,"" I managed, lamely.
He looked at me for a long, unreadable moment. He knew. Of course he knew. He knew I’d been about to say something else. He knew I'd lost my nerve.
He gave a tiny, almost imperceptible nod and walked away, leaving me alone in the kitchen, my hand stinging and my heart in my throat.
I leaned against the counter, closing my eyes. I was twenty six years old. He was twenty seven. We were just two guys in a crappy apartment, trying to make it. But in the name of love, or whatever this was, I was pretty sure I was going to be the one who didn't.",2,1761443105.0,Informal_Effect,0,1.0,False

I know this is due to the love we share but hear me out.

I have always been so in love with my Adam. Our relationship hit one year on the 18th September.

Basically what happens in whenever he’s around I feel a mix or feelings all the time and i’ll try to describe it as best as I can :

1- always super turned on, I don’t know he could be just in the kitchen making coffee. Even when I don’t specifically need to act on it I feel it all the time. He’s naturally a handsome man and easy on the eyes but it’s mostly the safe vibe that he gives off since we first met that hits me hard

2- I feel warm and electric in my chest, it’s not fuzzy and cute more like a burning inside my chest mixed with that Love aggression like the one that makes us women wanna bite someone out of nowhere (which I do a lot too) and i’m like UGGHH! 

3- He’s naturally always into physical touch, eats with one hand on my thigh, hugs me randomly in the house, sleep cuddled until morning

4- He has one distinct perfume and aftershave since we met (tabacco vanille) and it’s strong so it drowns any other smell in the house for me (except food! I love food) and don’t get me wrong I like it

5- his voice is stimulating as well, sometimes just talking about what he heard on the news, and when he gets all righteous and discussing politics and protests he’s somehow even hotter!?!

6- even at work we usually text way less but my clothes already smell like us, I got with me food he made, his little « Ohh check this prank my colleague did on me » type of texts

And i’m not even gonna talk about the intimacy

Anyway, all these things about are hyper stimulating and lately i find myself wishing I just had some time for myself away from all of this (yes i know horrible to say you need time away from your partner) and just stop the stimulation I feel all the time to be able to just relax and shut my mind off without his calling my name in the house or me hearing my phone goes ding all the time and thinking directly about him.
I just don’t know how to bring that up and say : hey i need a vacation alone where i don’t hear from you for a few days 💀

I really need days with no contact or stimulation 
Do you get the same or what do you suggest in this case? 

TL;DR : basically my boyfriend being around is overstimulating my sense and i really need a break but i feel guilty about it and don’t know how to lay it out there. ",0,1761443049.0,relationships,20,0.31,False

I initiated the separation for several reasons. Just know we both had and have work to do. 

So, I had every intention of going back home after a couple weeks but it’s been almost three months now. Partially because he didn’t really engage or speak with me for over two months.

My issue is now since he didn’t engage with me (even ignored me) for that amount of time I prepared for the worst and put my wall up. I don’t know how to bring it down now. I feel like I’m stuck in this place where I constantly feel like the rug is going to be pulled from under me. 

Despite all of that, I want my family back. I miss him, I miss my step son, I miss Disney trivia Fridays and cooking dinner and his stinky breath in the mornings. I miss making his coffee and his tight hugs after a little fight. 

I also know neither of us are healed enough from this situation to just jump back in. I also want my concerns addressed, I want to feel valued, appreciated, loved, sexy, desired, respected etc etc. I know he wants his addressed too. 

I don’t want to get my own place but I don’t know what to do because I also can’t live with my family member forever but I feel like if I jump and get a place that will push him further away. 

I have no idea what to do. It’s got me in a nasty state of depression, and I’m extremely anxious right now because everything is so very uncertain. 

Edited to add: The last therapy session was bad. I had been silently spiraling for weeks and completely lost it emotionally. So now he’s understandably backed off. ",1,1761442128.0,Separation,0,1.0,False

1og86v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandalsResorts/comments/1og86v1/dunns_river_review/,Dunn’s River Review!,"My husband and I just returned from a 7 night stay at Dunns River. I would say we had an overall great time. We flew into Montego Bay on a Wednesday morning. Originally we were supposed to land at noon however, we landed at 11:25. We did not use Club Mobay- I was a little nervous to not have it, but we flew through the customs process so fast. Probably took 10 minutes at most. The longest part was waiting for our bags to come out. We had carryons but had to check them at the gate on our first flight which was a bummer. We waited about 45 minutes for them to come which was so painful 😭. Once we got our bags we headed to the sandals lounge and checked in.We booked a private transfer and they told us it would be about 15 minutes. We only waited about 5 minutes before they came and got us! We loved the private transfer. I get car sick very easily so we chose this just in case we needed to stop. We made it to the resort in about an hour and 20 minutes so it was not too bad! 

We stayed in the travertine beach front club level room. We really enjoyed this room. We were able to watch the nightly entertainment from our balcony. I would say if you go to bed early this would not be a room for you. You can hear the entertainment even with the doors shut. But for us it was no biggie. 

We thought the food was pretty good and honestly we never had a bad meal. Some of the restaurants had way better service than others. It was weird we would order appetizers and meals and we would only get half of what we ordered even with the server writing it down & repeating it back. We thought it was a fluke the first time it happened, but it happened quite a bit. Our personal favorite was Banyu!The crispy rice tuna was soooo good! Our least favorite was probably Edessa. We loved going to Blum to get coffee and a sweet treat! All of the ladies working in there were fantastic. 

We did the island routes reggae sunset cruise with snorkeling. It was included with our reservation so we said why not. We had a great time and got to see so many different fish and sea animals! It was a great way to end our trip. 

On the way back we also did a private transfer. Our flight was at 1pm so we left the resort around 8:45. It took us 2 hours to get to the airport. We did not use club Mobay again. We got thru security and things no problem and by the time we walked around/ used the bathroom and got to our gate we only had to hangout for about 45 minutes. 

At first we were not going to rebook another trip with loyalty onsite. They ended up coming up to us at the pool one day so we decided just to go chat with them. I had already had an idea of where I wanted to go and when so I was prepared when we met with them. We ended up booking Curacao in May 2026 with the 777 deal, 11% loyalty discount, first time rebook discount, and we had some points from our trip. We saved about $1,500. 

Overall, we enjoyed our time and we hope to be back to Jamaica one day and our looking forward to Curacao next year! ",7,1761442011.0,SandalsResorts,1,1.0,False
1og86uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossJourneyUSA/comments/1og86uk/not_losing_weight_the_3_most_common_reasons_your/,"Not Losing Weight? The 3 Most Common Reasons Your ""Calorie Deficit"" is Failing (and How to Fix It for Sustainable Weight Loss)","We've all been there: You track every bite, you're hitting the gym, but the scale isn't moving. It’s frustrating when you're sure you're in a **Calorie Deficit**, but your **Weight Loss** has stalled (the dreaded plateau!).

After losing 60+ lbs and diving deep into the science, I've seen three core issues that trip up most people. These aren't just ""eat less"" tips; they're about fixing your process for **Sustainable Weight Loss**.



# Problem #1: You're Underestimating Your Calories (The Sneaky Sources)



This is the biggest offender on Reddit, and it has nothing to do with your main meals.

* **Oil & Dressings:** A single tablespoon of olive oil is $\\approx 120$ calories. Most people pour 2-3 times that without realizing it. Same goes for those ""light"" salad dressings.
* **Liquid Calories:** Sodas, fancy coffee drinks (especially creamers and syrups), and alcohol are often completely forgotten. Your daily afternoon latte can easily wipe out a small **Calorie Deficit**.
* **The ""Licks, Bites, and Tastes"" (LBTs):** A handful of nuts, a nibble of a kid’s snack, the spoonful of peanut butter taken straight from the jar. These micro-calories add up to hundreds by the end of the day.

**🔑 The SEO Fix:** Invest in a food scale. Weigh *everything* for just one week—especially your cooking oils and sauces. This radical transparency is the fastest way to kickstart your stalled progress.



# Problem #2: Not Prioritizing Protein & Fiber



You can eat 1,800 calories of chips and 1,800 calories of chicken breast and vegetables, but the outcome will feel wildly different.

* **Protein for Satiety & Metabolism:** **High Protein** intake is non-negotiable for **Weight Loss**. It keeps you full longer, reduces cravings, and helps preserve muscle mass while you shed fat. More muscle means a higher resting **Metabolism**.
* **Fiber for Volume:** Foods rich in **Fiber** (like vegetables, beans, and whole grains) give you ""volume eating"" power. You can eat *more food* for fewer calories, which is key to feeling satisfied on a deficit.

**🔑 The SEO Fix:** Aim for 0.8g to 1g of protein per pound of your goal body weight. Focus your **Meal Prep** around a protein source first (chicken, lean beef, tofu, Greek yogurt), then load up on high-fiber veggies.



# Problem #3: The All-or-Nothing Mentality (Losing Focus on Habits)



This is the psychological barrier that derails most long-term goals. One bad meal turns into a bad day, which turns into quitting for a month.

* **The Scale Lie:** The number on the scale fluctuates wildly due to water, sodium, and glycogen. Don't let a one-day spike define your entire journey. Look at the weekly trend (or focus on **Non-Scale Victories (NSV)** like clothes fitting better or better sleep).
* **Lack of Long-Term Habits:** If your current diet plan isn't something you can maintain for the rest of your life, it's not a true solution. The goal is *not* to diet forever; the goal is to build **Healthy Habits**.

**🔑 The SEO Fix:** Focus on small, manageable goals. Did you hit your water intake goal? Did you track all your food? Did you get your steps in? Celebrate consistency, not perfection. A single ""cheat meal"" will never ruin a consistent week. Get back on track at the very next meal.

I recently learned that one of his friends from med school was charged and sentenced last year after secretly filming women having sex with him with a nanny cam.**  

I was already wary of this guy since when I met him first, he was dating an 18yo girl as a 26yo professional. My boyfriend didn't approve of that, and I remember him saying he'd had stern words with him about it.  Now I think about it, this young girl was probably one of the victims. The friend's registration as a doctor is still suspended, thankfully, but he will work again, he'll be fine.  

What shocked me most was that my bf wrote him a reference for the sentencing magistrate. He wanted to support this friend and occasionally catches up with him, although he claims that after he found out, he felt differently and saw this friend ""more like a patient"" and ""just didn't want him kill himself"".  But, this guy helped my bf move house, they catch up for coffee... to me, that's a friendship.  (More context, this guy was good to my bf when he was having a hard time in the past and let him crash on his couch).

I can’t seem to get past it. To me, secretly filming women without consent isn’t a “mistake,” it’s sexual violence. I feel uneasy knowing my partner would vouch for someone who did that, especially given how much damage it causes to women’s trust and safety.  I think this guy must be a misogynist, and if you can be friends with a misogynist...

On the other hand, I have worked in criminal law and understand that perpetrators are people too, with complicated lives that lead them to do awful things.

1og82ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/FTMventing/comments/1og82ne/my_monster/,My monster,"Everyone has a monster. The thing they keep hidden and don't let the shine of day touch. The thing that would cause havoc if it came out. The reason we are who we are. The invisible hand guiding us.

I think my monster is my transness. 

I cannot pin point the reason why I am the way I am. Not exactly. I don't think anyone can. But I can present my findings and explain myself. I believe my transness (or queerness) has been the single, strongest force guiding my life. 

I was so happy as a kid. I was clueless and unapologetically myself. I didn't know anything about anything and just accepted many things as they were because I didn't know there was an option to do otherwise (this will come up later). But, whenever a choice presented itself I responded in my truest form. I picked male characters when playing games, I took my shirt off when I had the chance, I played rough, I was messy, I liked soccer, I never let my hair down (I didn't ask for a haircut because I didn't know that was an option). I could keep going. I was just myself. And I didn't think about it. I just was. But then things just started happening. I realized there was a clear dissonance into how I saw myself and how people saw me whenever I would get gifted a doll for my birthday, or a headband, or a dress, or makeup. It was a reminder of who they wanted me to be. I would look at the present I got and glance over and see the remote control car my brother had gotten and be jealous. I'd look over at my sister and see how happy she was with what she'd gotten. It was the same as mine. I felt it was unfair. How come they get to enjoy their present and I don't? To this day I don't like celebrating Christmas or my birthday. It reminds me of those moments and the week after going back to the shops with my parents to exchange everything, while being called ungrateful. To this day I have presents I never used I got when I was a kid. And I obviously didn't understand any of this when I was that young. I just thought my family really didn't know me and I was shocked how little attention they paid me. All these years later and I still can't escape the purses, handbags and jewelry. It's a slap in the face every time. 

I think this created a lot of shame within me. I never really talked about what I liked. I remember being really interested in maths and computers (I am a software engineer now) but never actually doing anything with it besides the standard school work. I'm not sure why. Maybe I felt I wasn't allowed to pursue that. Overall, I just didn't talk about things until someone else brought it up and I thought it was okay to mention it. So much of my life has been visited by shame. Not only at home but at school too. It's hard to put my life into words because how do I that without explaining everything. 

School was another source of shame for me. I was friends with the boys but never really fit in with them for obvious reasons. I was also friends with the girls but my own personal demons kept them at arms length. It's hard to make girl friends in middle school when you're not interested in make up, clothes and boys. And it's hard to make boy friends in middle school when you're not a boy. I was always dancing in the shadows. 

At the center of everything there it was, my monster. 

We didn't formally meet until I was 16. That's when our first formal introduction took place. I denied him for a while. Ignored him. But he made himself known. He tried showing me a different life was possible. I let him out to peak for a bit when I was 17. And he stayed until a few months before my 19th birthday. His presence was only known to me, though. That's a pact we both made and he agreed. He had to go back into hiding because the world showed him it wasn't safe for him to be out. He went back inside. But it was different this time, he'd dipped his toes in the river.

The year and a half my monster was around was good. It wasn't excellent but it was good. He showed me a few tricks. The one I treasure the most is him teaching me there are different ways of living and that's okay. 

I remember being around 16, junior year of high school talking to a friend. She was a very girly girl. She knew I was not. We were talking about what jobs we'd had in the future. She asked me what I would do if I had to wear a skirt and heals for my job. I told her I would simply not take the job. She told me I'd have to if it was an office job (we were 16 and didn't know). I don't remember what I said but I do remember being worried. Suddenly this ""fuck, I've never thought about this before"" thought came to me. That worried me. I thought this meant office jobs just weren't an option for me anymore. That that was it. Another thing to worry about. I was also worried about my wedding. I didn't want to have one, I didn't want to wear a dress or heals. I didn't want any of it. But I didn't know that was an option. My monster would later on show me otherwise.

It's been 6 years that my monster went back into hiding. He doesn't cry out for peaking anymore but I sometimes hear him whispering. I've made a very good job hiding him. 

Hiding. This is another thing I'm good at. I've been hiding for as long as I can remember. I hide everything. From everyone. I don't think I've ever been sincere about a single thing in my entire life. I might be a pathological liar. I've become a master at hiding. I've had to. I remember back when Instagram had the activity tab. I was acutely aware of it. It stopped myself from liking, following, commenting and interacting with countless of content. I was paranoid my mom or sister or anyone who followed me would be able to see my activity on the tab and take a whiff of my monster. I would only use my phone while sitting with a wall right behind me. I was paranoid someone would stand behind me and see my screen over my shoulder. I'd love to say this behavior has stopped, but that's not the case. It's gotten worse as I've gotten older. I hide a lot more now. I've let my monster out briefly, too, over the years. Let him speak up a tiny bit. See how the world responded to him. Let him be seen. I'd do this by recommending a movie we should watch, or expressing an opinion, or playing a song, or liking a certain actor. And most of the time my monster was not met with kind words. I rarely let him out now, only when there's a good excuse. But the hiding is getting to me. And it all boils down to the same feeling: how unfair I think it all is. My brother is currently freely experimenting with a new style. Complete wardrobe change. I feel I've had to explain every piece of clothing I own. My sister is so unapologetically herself. And that's easy to be when you so perfectly fit the mold. She wanted a haircut and my mom took her to the hair salon and had a little outing. Went for coffee and everything. She buys clothes and practically models them for my mom. She wanted to do pilates and she just went and booked a few classes. She likes make up and talks about that with my mom. She wanted to do yoga at home and bought a mat and she set it up and now does it. I keep trans tape on my work bag and had to apply it at my work bathroom to avoid getting caught. There was no mirror in the stall. I bought a book and had it deliver to a distribution center instead of my house. I kept it my bag for a few days and now it's hiding in my night stand drawer. I asked my mom for a haircut a few days ago and every time I ask that I feel I'm in an interrogation room. Every request feels like poison slipping out my mouth. I never get exactly what I want but it's a middle ground between what I want and what I know she'll accept. I've been working on some projects on my computer and I only ever work at them when I know no one will come to interrupt me. I don't want to tell them what I'm doing and I don't want to explain. It has nothing to do with my monster but after hiding from so long I don't let any part of me, monster or not, be seen. I just don't think it's fair. 

Somehow, I've become my own best friend. I think I had to out of self preservation. Even though I truly have no one who really knows me, I am surprisingly well adjusted. I have no mental or physical health issues. I sleep well. I take care of myself. I function perfectly. I know I could keep going like this my entire life. But I don't think I want to. I long to be seen. I long for connection. But it's so hard. Specially for someone like me. I cannot unload all of this to someone. They wouldn't get it. My sister complains about ""being different"" from other people. But I look at her and she's so normal. She can easily fit in. She even looks the part. I am so different. I stick out. I've gone through things most people haven't and never will. I just can't see a way out of this one because I've never met anyone who would truly accept me. 

I think my monster is kind. When he was out for that year and a half he saw firsthand how difficult it would be for me. He saw the looks, heard the comments, the side eyes, he saw 10, 20, 30 years into the future and he saw pain. He saw how it completely changed my life. He saw a complete wipe down would be needed. He saw me grieving it all. My family. My old life. He saw my pain. And so he decided to leave. He want back inside. Deeper this time. He thinks he's doing this for me. He's trying to protect me. I don't feel him most of the time now. He keeps quiet. Sometimes I'm so busy I forget about him entirely. I forget he even was here once. But he whispers to me sometimes. He breathes inside of me. I hear him scratching the walls when something makes me think of him. He's made peace with himself and he promised he'll never come out to play again. I believe him. He's content just meeting with me at night sometimes. It's up to me whether he'll ever come out or not. I know I can live my whole life with my monster inside of me. I know he won't bother to take control. But man do I feel I'm doing him a disservice. I know firsthand what unfairness feels like. He is a part of me and he'll always be present. I carry him with me. He's always been here for me. 

If anyone ever finds out about him I'm done. He is my monster, my single point of failure. He is the reason I am who I am and the reason this could all be taken from me. I am so scared for him. But he is safe inside of me. I am working towards making it safe for him out here too. And while he may never be able to take full control, I am willing to share with him.

1og81yt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1og81yt,"Brain-unplugged, let me live my life skittle 🍂","Had a super productive Saturday, knocking out chores, baking and holiday knitting. But started feeling off and sad this evening, so decided to swatch every color left on my fall rack instead of doing the last thing on my to-do list.

Unexpected standout: cirque - fox glove (the spangly mauve shimmer is giving Barbie)

Lowest effort application: cirque - red sprite (even, but sheer as hell)

Worst application 😖: lurid - darkened trail (multi-dip required, jagged brush stroke on far side of nail) 

Most disappointing (tie): 
Both SO SHEER, but SO PRETTY. And I like sheer, but bald spots in 3 coats is not it 😭

nothing basic - aye aye captain

Phoenix - Dracula from Transylvania 

All in 3 coats

Left hand:

Pinkie: cirque - red sprite (velvetized)

Ring: Phoenix - Dracula from Transylvania (left a bald spot, but those flakes are WORTH IT, thick coats 👏)

Middle: glitch - all hallows’ eve

Index: garden path - mama needs a night off (leans really gold, will probably layer over an olive jelly)

Thumb: cracked - hex mix

RIGHT HAND:

Thumb: lurid - darkened trail 

Index: cirque - nightshade (I magnetized 2 layers before realizing it’s not magnetic 😭)

Middle: Phoenix - Halloween in Hawkins

Ring: nothing basic - aye aye captain

Pinky: cirque - fox glove

Last 2 pics are ONE COAT 😳

Now I’m off to get a caramelly coffee and knock out that last thing on my list ✌️",11,1761441595.0,RedditLaqueristas,3,1.0,False
1og81ye,https://www.reddit.com/r/Invincible_TV/comments/1og81ye/tbhi_wholeheartedly_feel_like_if_cecil_just_told/,"Tbh,I wholeheartedly feel like If Cecil just told Mark his backstory,like how he got his scar and such, it would've gone so much more smoother.","Like I'm pretty sure just going ""hey Mark,I understand what you're going through and see your anger.""
""You see this scar?yeah I got this from when I was younger when I had to work with 2 villains and to say I reacted worse then you would be a understatement but I've learned that even the worst people can make good tools to help protect others and I'm sorry I didn't tell you but as it stands, we need all the help we can get to bring down the threat we both face together.""

""And I promise you that these guys aren't getting off scot-free,they will be watched and surveillanced and will be dealt with if they step out of line but don't think of this as me giving them comfy jobs,this is me using them and their tools and then serving our their sentence to protect the people they hurt.""

""I understand your anger and we can talk more about this over Coffee or tea.""

That would've gone so much smoother and applying basic human understanding and compassion literally would've gone so far.

No Reanimates or sound device or anything like that,just talking to Mark like a damn person and not a killing machine/threat would've gone so far as well. 

Like summoning the Reanimates when Mark was arguing and talking back was foolish..hell,even going into the white room alone was foolish.

Mark was angry and defying authority(which is to be expected, he is a teenager going through BS)but it is your job as the adult in the situation to deal with that accordingly and he also knew that Mark wasn't gonna hurt him or had any intention of hurting him.

Using murderers for good is one thing but not only inserting a weapon in his head like he's a apart of the Suicide squad and to torture him and hurt him like that is not only cruel but mind numbingly foolish for someone who wants to save the world. 

But it's pretty obvious that almost all of this is cause Cecil is heavily paranoid and irrational cause of his trauma and fear of Nolan.

He is trying to make Mark less of a issue and that's not necessarily Mark's fault but Cecil just is trying anything to get control over him and some form of power over him.",4,1761441594.0,Invincible_TV,2,0.84,False

Hey gets this chai drink and bumps into Baku. In like two blinks, they're kissing outside the tea shop for the first time. Ochako interrupts them.

Not always possible but if calendars/interests allow, sign kids to the same activities your friends sign their kids for. May require some extra driving and flexibility on day/time but as a trade off you spend this time with people you enjoy rather than doom scrolling or making always small talk to other parents. 

For parent-tot, you can hang out during the class. With older kids, it gives you an hour or so to grab coffees and chat.

1og7u0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Plumbing/comments/1og7u0k/slow_kitchen_sink_probably_from_coffee_grounds/,Slow kitchen sink - probably from coffee grounds?,"Hey everyone.    I have a slow kitchen sink.   House is 7 years old and I have been pouring French press grounds down the sink since day 1, I did not know that was a bad idea.   I do try pretty hard not to pour any grease down the drain, but I do cook and do dishes, and there is a disposal.

I checked the p-trap, that’s clear.  I also was able to access a clean out in the wall about 4ft from the sink,   There was some gunk on the shelf where you can see into the vertical pipe, but the vertical pipe looked pretty clean.   I ran some water from a hose into the clean out, an eventually it filled up and came back out.   So I suspect the clog is some number of feet down and past the clean out.

I have tried a plunger for about 10 minutes, but couldn’t get anything to budge.  (Edit: I’m thinking I may not have done the plunger correctly since the AAV is hooked to the dishwater and the disposal.   I capped the AAV, but was probably just diving water into the dishwasher, so maybe I will try to cap that and try to plunge again, though it looks a little involved.)

I called a plumber (roto rooter) and he came out and said for $500 he could snake it, or $1000 he could water jet it.   I live in California where things are expensive but I didn’t realize it would be that expensive.

I already realize I need to change my coffee grounds habit, but how to deal with the drain?   Any chance it will clear on its own with regular hot water flushing if I stop putting coffee grounds down, perhaps plus some home remedies?   Or is some professional help in order?   If professional help is in order, auger or water jet and what is a reasonable price?

Thanks in advance.",1,1761440905.0,Plumbing,1,0.67,False
