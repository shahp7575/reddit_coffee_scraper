However, for the past week or two I have been getting insane headaches and just feel tired. I do not have diabetes, but these symptoms seem to connect to my carnivore diet. My diet usually consists of the following:

Breakfast: Water (Cut out Black coffee a week ago)

Lunch: 8oz beef, 4 oz ground turkey, 2 eggs, 120g egg white, 2 tbsp butter, kerrygold cheese, 2 strips bacon.

Snack: 2 hardboiled eggs

Dinner: 8oz bacon wrapped sirloin, 2 eggs, 100g egg white, 1 tbsp butter

I also take a packet of LMNT unflavored with a 1/4 tsp of nosalt daily. I workout 4 days a week and stay active the other days. Take Zyrtec (allergy meds), Vitamin D3, K2, Omega 3 Fish oil, and 1 tsp of egg shell powder daily.

Is there a link between hypoglycemia and my headaches/tiredness? I ate a small handful of frozen blueberries this morning and my headache went away over 20-30 min. What do I need to change in my diet while still keeping my goals?",1,1736957409.0,keto,0,1.0,False

They worked together once a week. 
I didn’t know he’d met a new coworker til a month or two later when I saw a text from her that just said “okayyyy :)” no other texts. So I knew he was deleting texts from her. I confronted him and he said he hid it from me because he didn’t want me getting jealous and overthinking their friendship (since I was pregnant and hormonal). 
He promised not to delete texts anymore. But what he did after was he turned off text notifications so they no longer popped up on his homescreen. I asked him why he did that he said he didn’t like people seeing who was texting him.
He stopped working with her later on in the year (he quit the job) but was still talking to her on the phone and texting frequently. This was because they wanted to go into a business together. This business also included a third person who was not on the phone with them as frequently. 
I really didn’t like the idea of them goig into a business together but I he begged me to trust him and that he only had good intentions for our family. So I did. 
During the past year some stuff has happened, 
Once she asked to meet at a coffee shop to go over stuff she needed help with, but it was Labor Day weekend and I saw on find my friends he was on the strand at the beach. He didn’t tell me. But I asked him why what happened and he said the coffee shop was packed so they walked the strand and talked. 
Second, they had to go to a meeting about 1 hr away so she begged him to carpool cause she didn’t want to drive alone. I wasn’t comfortable and I told him no but he still went.
Third, they would have hourly+ phone convo which he insisted was about business. 
She also recently moved into our neighborhood and always asks him to come out for dinner. He said it’s cause they have lots to talk about for business. He has not gone yet.
Last, he had an opening party for one of his new jobs and he invited her to it but didn’t let me know. I found out by seeing some pics. When I confronted him he said it was a professional event where he had her come to make connections for their business.
I asked him why he always hides things from me still and he just said he forgot to tell me. 
I’ve also found out that they’ve been gifting each other books and idk what else but the only thing I’ve found so far is books and he never told me he’d be getting her a gift. 
He never even gets me gifts not even for Christmas I just got some last minute gift (dinner at a restaurant).

Now here is the issue, they were in the business with a third person but now they are having issues with the third person not pulling their weight. So she wants to kick the third person out and do business with my husband only. 

I know nothing has happened in between them but I also feel like this is where things can potentially get messy in the future.
But how am I supposed to tell him no when this is his best way of opening his business (working with another person who is also well connected in the field). ",1,1736957324.0,AskMenAdvice,1,1.0,False

Well, bless your little heart, Grace, but someone needs to sit you down and tell you the cold, hard truth. Sugar, your behavior is downright embarrassing. Ain’t no way your little TikTok tantrums and mean gossip about MK have somehow ruined your life to the point you “can’t get a job.” Honey, that’s the kind of nonsense only you could believe.

You could get a job, but we both know you’d rather sit in that camper with your hand out, crying for donations while you sip your overpriced coffee and complain about your hard life. Let me tell you something: those poor folks working honest jobs to send you money? They’re waking up at the crack of dawn while you’re busy playing victim on the internet.

And don’t even get me started on that “rare redhead” mess. You’re pretty, sure, but darlin’, you ain’t THAT pretty. Ain’t nobody jealous of you for being “unique.” You need to sit down, take a look in the mirror, and humble yourself because your delusions are running faster than your common sense.

And this self-diagnosed “autism” and “Christian” act of yours? Oh, please. A real Christian wouldn’t be running their mouth like you do, dragging other people’s names through the mud to get attention. That baby-voice gig you’ve got going might fool some people, but trust me, more and more of us are catching on to the scam.

Sweetheart, if you spent half the time working that you do stirring up drama and playing the victim, you’d have a real life by now. But no, you’d rather keep spinning your sad little stories, blaming everyone else for the mess you made of your life. We’re all just plum tired of it. So, grow up, get a job, and stop acting like the world owes you something. It doesn’t.

Listen here, Grace, you’ve gone and lost the bloody plot. There’s no way in hell your little TikTok stunts and rubbish about MK have “ruined” your chances of getting a job. Fair dinkum, you’ve got to be kidding me. Pull your head in and take some responsibility for once in your life.

We both know you don’t want a job. You’re too busy sitting in your camper, Grace, mi affi tell yuh dis straight-yuh behaviour a pure slackness. Yuh really deh pon TikTok a chat seh yuh cyaah get a job
'cause MK and some drama? A joke ting dat, mi nah go lie. Yuh need fi wake up and face reality, gyal. Dis life weh yuh a live? A yuh create it fi yuhself, so stop blame people.

Since time immemorial there has been an unending clash between Thiests and Athiests regarding God and multiple statements the thiests make.

One such statement that gets a lot of Thiests in hot water is

“If God (let's assume there's one) created everything and everything requires a Cause, who or what caused God?""

Now, thiests sometimes don't know how to answer but mostly just say ;

“No one. He's self existent, cuz of the way he is”

Now, athiests mostly dismiss this by saying how such a “cop out” of an answer that is and thus it doesn't make sense that a Being have no cause yet cause everything else. But here I decided to formulate a counter argument to this objection with logical implications and scriptural quotations.

Note: This theory aims to serve the purpose of a “counter argument” to a common objection to God's non causality. It's not meant to “prove” God's over all existence or any of his other attributes like (all loving etc,.). Just a counter argument and a fun thought experiment, Okay? Ook. So just breathe, take a sip of coffee or tea and let's go, shall we?


The Existence of God or Īśvara or Brahman as been described by the Shāstras multiple times as beginningless and non dual.

Chandogya Upanishad VI.i.1:

“Existence alone was this in the beginning, one only without a second.”
And that it was this Īśvara who manifested the universe

Aitareya Upanishad I.i.1:

“It willed, ‘Let me project the worlds.’”
It also states that the Lord makes the universes by dissolving the previous ones.

Bhagavad Gita 9.7–8

sarva-bhūtāni kaunteya

kalpa-kṣhaye punas tāni

prakṛitiṁ svām avaṣhṭabhya

bhūta-grāmam imaṁ kṛitsnam
avaśaṁ prakṛiter vaśāt ||

• Translation: ""At the end of a kalpa, all beings enter My Prakṛiti, and at the beginning of the next kalpa, I create them again.I control My Prakṛiti and create this multitude of beings again and again, who are helpless under the sway of Prakṛiti.""

Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 3.29.29

kālaḥ pradhvaṁsa-kartā yo bhūtānāṁ prabhavaḥ svayam |
yo ’bhāvāya ca bhūtānāṁ sa eva madhusūdanaḥ ||

• Translation: ""Time is the destroyer of everything, the creator of all beings, and the very cause of their annihilation. That Time itself is none other than Madhusūdana (Krishna).""

Mundaka Upanishad (Verse 1.1.7):

यथोर्णनाभिः सृजते गृह्णते च यथा पृथिव्यामोषधयः संभवन्ति ।
यथा सतः पुरुषात्केशलोमानि तथाऽक्षरात्संभवतीह विश्वम् ॥ ७ ॥

yathorṇanābhiḥ sṛjate gṛhṇate ca yathā pṛthivyāmoṣadhayaḥ saṃbhavanti |
yathā sataḥ puruṣātkeśalomāni tathā'kṣarātsaṃbhavatīha viśvam || 7 ||

• 7. As the spider creates and absorbs, as medicinal plants grow from the earth, as hairs grow from the living person, so this universe proceeds from the immortal.

-> It's also stated that this God is imperceptible and not within logical and material constrains

Bhagavad Gita 7.25

nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ | mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam ||

• Translation: I am not revealed to everyone, being veiled by My yoga-māyā. This deluded world does not know Me, the unborn and imperishable One.

Now, it's been established that this Brahman makes the unmanifest world manifest by dissolving the Universe prior and making a new one, unlike the Abrahamic Religions which state the theory of Creatio- Ex Nihillo ( Creation from Nothing)

Obviously, this concept has been rejected by modern scholars and Philosophers as something can't come from Nothing.

Thus, it's more reasonable that A God would simply recycle the matter and energy dissolved in the previous ones.


Now this one Primordial God creates the world by letting out all his Śaktis, His aspects, Time, Ākāsa etc,. in the event of Srshti. This Non Dual Brahman gives rise to the world of Duality by power of his Māya.

""The Lord on account of his Māya is perceived Manifold ""

[Brihadaranyaka upanishad. II. v. 19]l

Bhagavad Gita 7.14

daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā |
mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te ||

• Translation: This divine Māyā of Mine, consisting of the three guṇas, is difficult to overcome. But those who surrender to Me alone can transcend this Māyā.

The Prakṛiti itself is Māya. Sometimes Māya is also defined as something which deluded by the use of Tri-Gunas (Sattva, Rājas and Tāmas ). Another lesser known yet apt definition of Māya is Vāyu-purāṇa (IV.30-31) says:—“To measure (mā) is to make a thing by giving shape to it and existence”. The denotattion and connotation of the word Māyā and the principle underlying it expound the same truth. “Māyā or manifestation means division of the hitherto undivided principle; on itself it performs this operation and as Puruṣa it henceforth thinks of itself as composed of parts.”

Regardless, all this Power and energy of Prakṛti, as well as the aggregate of Chit (Souls) called Puruṣa are present in the form of a Golden Egg Hiranyagarbha. With the help of Kāla Śaktī and other catalysts this point of singularity begans to spontaneously expand rapidly. Then Brahma's born and he moulds the Universe as per the Command of Bhagavān and all that stuff.

OK so, we've discussed the “process” of the creation as per the world view of Shāstra which seems to align quite well with the idea of The Big Bang. Yet, here's the problem that one will ask,

“Sure bro, fine. Let's assume there's a God who's the cause of everything including the Big Bang. But who in the Goddamn Heck, Caused God?!”


This is where I'd like to present my theory.

To understand this first we need to know what exactly is causality, time and space and Big Bang.

Time and Space:
Time and space or space time owe their existence to the Big Bang as per Scientific Observations and deductions. We also know Time and Space are inter-dependent and thus one can't exist without the other. And it's by the interaction of Space (Matter) and Time by which things are caused.

Let's Speak of Causality;

Causality:
Causality, at its core, is the principle that an event (the cause) brings about another event (the effect). However, whether causality itself depends on space and time to exist is a nuanced question.

1.Causality and Time:

Time as a Framework for Causality: Causality is fundamentally tied to the concept of time because the cause must precede the effect in temporal order. For example, striking a match (cause) must occur before the flame appears (effect). This temporal sequence is central to the very definition of causality.
Dependence on Temporal Flow: Without the passage of time, it becomes impossible to distinguish between ""before"" and ""after."" In a timeless framework, the notions of cause and effect collapse into simultaneity, making causality meaningless in its conventional sense.
2.Causality and Space:

Interaction in Space: Many causal relationships involve interactions that require spatial proximity or a medium. For instance:Gravity requires the presence of masses in space to exert force.Sound waves need air or another medium to transmit vibrations.Chemical reactions depend on molecules interacting in space.
Dependence on Spatial Connectivity: For a cause to influence an effect, there must often be a spatial connection, either direct (e.g., physical contact) or mediated by forces or fields.
This means that the very Principle of Causality owes it's origin or is atleast super-intertwined with Time and Space to function. Modern physics, particularly Einstein's general relativity, suggests that time and space themselves started with the Big Bang.

Asking ""what happened before the Big Bang"" may not make sense because ""before"" assumes the existence of time, which did not exist prior to the Big Bang.

Something needs to be caused, and there needs to be a Where (space)and a When(time). But spacetime themselves owe their origin or manifestation to the Big Bang. Meaning prior to the Big Bang, if as you have said “For the sake of the argument let's assume or accept” A Being or Force or God existed then it logically cannot be caused as that would require the Principle Of Causality and as I said, that requires a ‘Where’ and a ‘When’, both of which don't exist as that depends on Spatial Connectivity and Time both which haven't been manifested or present yet ,meaning the question is Logically Invalid on whether God can be “caused”. (This can also apply to any physical concept of the material universe of which to speak because they also rely on spacetime)

Now, there are however a few nuances to the Principle Of Causality which I'll present here:

Quantum Exceptions: In certain quantum phenomena, such as entanglement, the classical sequence of cause and effect appears ambiguous or instantaneous but still occur within the…fabric of spacetime.

( Entanglement:

At the quantum level (the tiniest particles like electrons or photons), particles can become ""entangled."" This means their properties (like spin or polarization) are connected in such a way that whatever happens to one particle instantly affects the other, no matter how far apart they are.
Scientists aren’t sure how this instant connection works. It’s not like the particles are sending a signal to each other. Instead, it’s as if they are two parts of the same ""thing,"" even when separated. This is why Einstein called it ""spooky action at a distance."")
Non-Locality in Quantum Mechanics: In quantum physics, phenomena like entanglement (again) suggest that spatial separation might not always constrain causality. However, even in these cases, the concept of spacetime as a whole is necessary for understanding them interactions.

Abstract Causality

Logical and Mathematical Causality: Outside the physical realm, causality can exist in logical or mathematical systems where time and space are not factors. For example: In mathematics, if A=B+C we can say B and C ""cause"" A, but no temporal sequence or spatial interaction is computer science, an algorithm's output depends on its input, a causal relationship independent of time and space.
Both of these nuances however don't really challenge the theory here as;

Our theory states that:

God exists beyond time, space, and causality because these dimensions (and causality itself) arise only after the Big Bang.
As God transcends these constraints, He cannot be “caused” or subject to causality, since causality depends on time and space.
This is not a cop-out but a logical conclusion that God, as a transcendent Being, is not bound by the laws of the universe.
I'm pretty sure we had the attributes of God established or assumed in the beginning.
Does Quantum Entanglement Challenge This?

At first glance, quantum entanglement might seem to challenge the theory at hand because:

Entanglement shows that particles can interact in ways that don’t seem to respect the classical rules of time, space, and causality.
The ""instantaneous connection"" between entangled particles might make it seem like causality isn't bound by time and space.
But we say not so, on account of the facts that;

A. Entanglement Still Depends on Spacetime

While entanglement shows instantaneous ""connections,"" it doesn’t exist outside of spacetime. The particles are still part of the spacetime framework, and their entangled state was established within spacetime when they interacted initially.
B. God Is Beyond the Universe, Entanglement Is Not

Entanglement applies to particles that exist in the physical universe. These particles are still subject to the laws of quantum mechanics, which operate within the framework of the universe. God isn't as I've established thanks to that whole Spacetime laws crap
C. Entanglement Supports the Idea of a Reality Beyond Our Understanding

If anything, entanglement strengthens the argument that the universe operates in ways that go beyond human logic.
If quantum mechanics can reveal phenomena like entanglement, where classical causality seems to ""break,"" it’s not unreasonable to believe in a transcendent Being that operates outside all known laws, including causality.
3. Reconciling God’s Non-Causality with Entanglement

To reconcile this theory with entanglement you should

Recognize that quantum entanglement doesn’t eliminate the need for time and space entirely, As It just shows that the universe has deeper, more complex connections than we understand .
God, as the origin of all reality, could be seen as the source of the laws that govern quantum phenomena, including entanglement. However, being beyond the universe, God is not subject to those laws Himself, as he pervades the universe and possesses them as his body or modes and is basically A Universal Soul-Paramātmā. Indeed, the Universally Pervading Soul God isn't subject to all this as said in (Chanddhogya Upanishad. VIII.i.5): “This Self is free from evil, old age, death and sorrow, without hunger, and thirst, with true desires and true volitions”.
Same with Abstract Causality

1.Abstract Causality and Its Domain

Abstract mathematical causality operates purely within the logical and conceptual domain. It doesn’t involve time, space, or physical causation.
It’s simply a set of rules or relationships, like saying A=B+C .These rules don’t require physical existence or temporal progression—they’re just logical truths.
2. Why It Doesn’t Apply to God:

Our theory is about God’s transcendence over physical causality, which is tied to time and space. Abstract causality, being a conceptual framework, is unrelated to physical

God, exists beyond all frameworks, including both physical and conceptual as said in ( Brihadaranyaka upanishad. III. iv. 2): “ You cannot know the Knower of knowing, or think the thinker of thinking—”.
Abstract causality is a human construct, a way for our minds to describe relationships. God, as a transcendent Being, is not limited by or dependent on human concepts like mathematics or logic.
Abstract causality might explain logical systems within the universe, but it doesn’t apply to God because God, by definition, is beyond all systems—physical and abstract.
3.This too strengthens the Theory:

Abstract might even be taken to support the argument! How u might ask?

Abstract mathematical truths (like 2+2=4) exist independently of time, space, or causality. They are eternal and unchanging.
If abstract truths can exist outside physical causality, it’s reasonable to argue that God, who is far beyond any abstract concept, can exist without being caused.
Just as mathematical relationships don’t require a “cause,” God’s existence doesn’t either.
Thus, God's Non Causality has a Logical implication and is not merely a cop out.


And to those who start whining about;

""OH U DIDN'T PROVE GOD EXISTS! WHAT ABUOT OTHR RELIGIOONSS REEEE!!""

My dear brother read the note, matter of fact, lemme repeat

This theory is not meant to prove God's existence or address other attributes (like all loving etc,.)or religions; or a standalone statement. It’s simply a counterargument to a common objection to God’s non-causality—a fun thought experiment. I mean it literally begins with the Assumption that “God exists"" and has words like “for the sake of argument”. So relax, grab a coffee or tea and chill the hell out.
But yeah, that's my theory for y'all. I'd like to know how it's received and how correct it is cuz I ain't no mathematician or quantum physicist I'll tell you that 😅.

Let me end this off with a prayer to Lord Hayagriva, the Lord Of Knowledge:

Jñānānanda-mayam devam nirmala-sphaṭikākṛtim |
Ādhāram sarva-vidyānām hayagrīvam upāsmahe ||

Translation:""I meditate upon Lord Hayagriva, the embodiment of knowledge and bliss, who shines with the pure brilliance of a flawless crystal and is the foundation of all forms of learning.""

**AITA for taking away my girlfriends sandwhich**

**Originally posted to r/AmItheAsshole**

[Original Post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xzoivl/aita_for_taking_away_my_girlfriends_sandwhich/)  **Oct 9, 2022**

Ive been dating this amazing girl for 6 months. We were in love and i thought commited to each other. 

So a side note, Im a cook for work and ive come home with sandwhiches i made and told her she can have some before. Last time i made a sandwhich, she was taking a bite of it and some deli meat slid out from under the bun a little bit. It annoyed me because im eating it too and shes just ruining this sandwhich i made. I told her to please be careful because it makes it annoying for when i take a bite. 

Yestarday, we were going to a wedding and there was a ceremony in the morning and the reception was in the afternoon. We had some time to kill between those two things and we were out of town in a hotel, so she decided to stay at the hotel as she said she wanted to recharge and have a coffee and a snack. I decided to go back with her and told her i made a sandwhich we could both split and take bites out of until we have food at the reception in a little bit. 

She sat down at a desk with the sandwhich next to her and began reading something. Every once in a while she took a bite but she was gripping this sandwhich with 2 hands and eating it in this way where i felt like she was going to fuck it up, so i said “ok thats it this is my sandwhich now. Im sorry ill buy you something later”. I took the sandwhich out her hands and walked away with it and ate it.

At first, she was silent and continued reading what she was reading. After a little bit, i started to feel like she was acting weird so i told her “the taxi for the reception is going to be here in a couple mins”. She said ok and continued being silent. After feeling like i fucked up, i asked her “do you want anything? Do you want your coffee or a bite out of the sandwhich?” She got up and angrily began walking to the washroom. She began packing. She told me she didnt feel like anything and i followed her and asked what was wrong. 

She began saying how she doesnt even feel like staying in the hotel, in fact, shell start driving 7 hours back home and that were done.

She told me that i need to reevaluate my priorities in life because prior to this, she was willing to overlook some faults in me like my lack of understanding her perspective as a brown woman if i just tried to genuinley understand and be empathetic. She was ready to look past some gross housekeeping/ hygiene habits i have and be patient with me while i work on gaining confidence and generally having a healthier more objective, constructive view of life. I tried to get her to stay and talk and followed her to her car but she left anyways.

I feel so stupid. I love her so much. We drove out 7 hours to be here and now all my family sees is that i looked happy and arrived with a girl and now for some reason she is gone and my mom needs to drive me back when we go home. AITA?

>This is one of those posts that I just wonder if it's real, because it's so weird. Getting upset because a sandwich gets ""messed up"" while someone is eating it, isn't normal. Thinking that a sandwich is ruined because the meat slides around or out a bit, isn't normal. Policing how someone eats a sandwich, isn't normal. Also, sharing a sandwich bite-for-bite, isn't exactly normal either.

>If you don't like the way she eats the sandwich why don't you make two sandwiches? Or cut the sandwich in half when you share it? Taking her snack away because you didn't like the way she was eating it, is extraordinarily controlling and screwed up.

Hey original poster here

Im getting a resounding yes i am the asshole to this, and honestly, i know im the asshole and i think i just want to hear it for some reason. I loved her more than i loved anyone. She was one of the most important people in my life and i really mean it. She was the first woman i dated that i felt was my girlfriend and actually my best friend, and when were together i feel like im having just as much fun as i do when im with the boys. When we first met, i instantly thought i was punching above my weight. My family loves her, shes beautiful and a person whos charisma is immediatley seen. When we go out i get alot of “dude what spell did you cast on her”. I feel like everyone is always automatically kind to her. Shes a person who can be friends with anyone. I know i fucked up. Im not going to get this again. I always felt like i couldnt ask anything of her, and needed to just keep her happy with me.

To all asking, im 24 and she is 27.

She asked before for me to just do things like cut the sandwhich in half or split the food but i said cutting it makes me feel like an asshole, eapecially if i need more because im hungrier. This time was simply because there were no knives in our hotel room and i was too lazy to go find one and i think she just got used to taking bites out the same things. I feel like shit.

I tried the same coffee/dose/grind-size/puck-prep three times in a row and, no matter what, I'm consistently getting MUCH slower shots than I did when I was just hand-grinding. Shots that used to come out in 31 seconds are now taking around 44 seconds to get the same yield. Nothing else changed other than I now grind directly into my blind shaker rather than previously grinding in the grinder's catch cup and then putting the grounds into the shaker (can't imagine that would make that much of a difference).

Now I can redial all my coffee and grind courser instead to readjust for the Power Tower (since I would like to use it going forward), but before I do so, I just wanted to check, has anyone else noticed the same issue with theirs (or if someone doesn't have one, do the results make sense)? Is it anything to be concerned about my resulting drink if I have to redial it coarser to get the same yield?

A number of the ""local"" chains were, at some point, using Dunkin products. Sometimes you'd see the boxes of mix and other components that were branded, sometimes right down to the color schemes, the printed napkins and other things. 

Yet, during my time here, I do not believe we've ever had... a Dunkin Donuts. 

Frankly, there are no good traditional donuts anymore--you know, smaller pastries where you could get a dozen and have two or three for a variety of flavor. Don't get me wrong, I like Dough Hook's 3-6 dollar each elevated pastries, but that's not a donut to go with your coffee, ya know? My favorites used to be Donut Shop in Stayton (their cherry and blueberry glaze was amazing -- to bad they tried to go big and then went bust), and a little shop years ago in Cherry City Mall run by a Vietnamese (?) couple that had opened a shop there after closing a long time successfull one in Corvallis (?). Goddamn, those were some good donuts! Ahhhhhh... back when it sounded like $8.99 for a dozen donuts was expensive. LOL.

Personally I miss.

The scala cinema kings cross ( all nighter screenings where you could bring your own alcohol and food and practically camp out in the isles of the cinema with sleeping bags) 

the same with the old version of the ritzy brixton.

The borders bookshops where you could sit with a coffee and read books and magazines from the shelves and they encouraged it..

the kings cross resource centre CopyArt near the old gass towers where you could use apple macs by the hour (before computers were commonplace) and make your zines and posters on the colour copiers... before colour copiers were commonplace. I particularly remember over using the a3 black and white copier to make 3 meter x 5 meter billboards for an art project.  kings cross was a bit of a wasteland at that point.

CopyArt opened in 1984 in Kings Cross with funding from the Greater London Council (GLC), [https://radicalprintshops.org/doku.php?id=copyart](https://radicalprintshops.org/doku.php?id=copyart)

  
Photofusion in brixton... and the local shops that sold outdated photo paper for pennes.

Time out magazine and the flat letting section... It was so easy just to turn up and rent a flat or a room, a small queue of people and a few questions and you would be in your room that week...rents were so cheap compared to income.... i am not even going to say how much i was paying...

the routmasters with no closing back doors, being able to get on and off a bus wherever you liked... with zero regard to health and safety.

Hi therapist name,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is -, and I apologize if reaching out feels unorthodox. I’m writing because I’m struggling to process a situation involving my past relationship with (ex bf) and am seeking clarity.

I’m not sure if (ex bf) ever mentioned me, but we were in a relationship from September 2023 to September 2024. I’ve recently uncovered information suggesting he was most likely seeing (the girl he told me to not worry about) during that time, and they are now back together. (My ex) told me he sold his apartment in October and was in hospital until December 23, but when I confronted him about inconsistencies, he continued to try to cover it up.

I’m meeting him for coffee in February for answers, but I’m worried he’ll continue to lie. I’m reaching out because I don’t know where else to turn for some honest insight. After everything I’ve been through, I know I deserve the truth, but I don’t think I’ll ever get that from (ex bf), unfortunately.

I understand this may be outside of what you can address, and I fully respect the professional boundaries of your work with (ex bf). However, I’d like to know if he ever mentioned me to you. I realize you may not be able to provide any insight, and I respect that, but I’m struggling to understand why (ex bf) would treat me the way he has. It's heartbreaking, and I just need some clarity on whether he ever cared about me at all, or if it was all just an act.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Sincerely,my name

It's been fine up until about two months ago when I started having issues with gradient being incorrect shown in ride and total climb often being wildly off at ride completion. On some rides (and it's always hilly where I live) sections may almost flatline in the exported file. Equally, everything may appear fine and then the grade reading will suddenly be off - as an example today, the 1030 claimed I was on a flat section and the gradient was at least 5% and for several 100 metres. Then a bit later, on a real world -8% gradient, the 1030 claimed I was going up hill 2% and a little later (after a coffee stop in the dry) I was on a flat road and it claimed a 14% gradient and then claimed a negative gradient when I had been climbing a steady gradient of about 5% for several 100 metres. On today's ride the unit claimed an ascent of 1002 metres and a decent of 704. With Strava correction the elevation was 871. Before this started happening, what the Strava route and the Garmin actually saw were always within a few percent of each other.

The unit has been altitude calibrated (using the prescribed Garmin methods) and I have been careful to check that the casing ports are always free from blockages and liquids. It can be wet where I live but the unit has been fine until recently. I always have a Strava route loaded which I follow so the 1030 has access to GPS data as well as barometric pressure throughout the ride. 

I reached out to Garmin and, while helpful, their suggestions are nothing that I haven't already tried. They are offering a discount on a new unit but, even with this, it's a big wad of cost and I don't want to buy another one unless I have to.

I'd welcome any thoughts as to what may be wrong and what else I could try looking at to fix it.

Every Wednesday morning while I have my coffee, I'm going to address a common misconception in DECA. This is an opinion and observation-based week so take it with a grain of salt. For weeks backed by data, I'll cite my sources.

This may be hyperbole, but it feels like far too many Innovation papers go the medical route. This season alone, out of 14 papers reviewed, nine have been medical. Even worse, five have been cardiovascular, and three have been cancer. While that's not concerning in of itself, the fact that three of the cardiovascular projects had nearly identical ideas (and the same for two of the cancer projects) is.

I understand that it seems easy to invent something to miraculously heal a patient. That's impressive, right? However, as a mentor, those are the Innovation projects I always end up grading the hardest. Here's why:

\- I mentor at an ICDC level. The students I take under my wing are expected to develop an ICDC-level paper over 3-5 weeks, and as such, your idea isn't allowed to coast. If you make it to ICDC, you need to actually innovate.

\- I see a million of them, so I notice the inconsistencies or unrealistic features more. Especially at an ICDC level, even if an idea is actually innovative, there's a good chance that there's a similar project there. With the way grading/stage progression works, there's a good chance you'll get the same preliminary judge grading two medical papers. Judges try to remain unbiased, but at the end of the day, whatever medical paper is reviewed later will likely subconsciously be graded with the other in mind.

\- From 2017-2021, Innovation plans saw a \*ton\* of medical top 3 placers at ICDC. However, they all had fairly unique ideas, so the placement makes sense as a judge. Since then, medical papers have exploded. It's become a numbers game-- there are so many medical papers competing, so that's what ends up on top. Especially when DECA+ only shows top 3 ICDC papers, it gives students the illusion that that's what inherently ""wins"".

\- \[This is a very cynical point\] Students often include a sob story about the loss of a family member or traumatic experience with a medical issue, inspiring this innovation. After you see over 90% of medical Innovation plans include this, it feels insincere. Even worse, it feels manipulative and your overall paper suffers because you've sacrificed space to spend on something that's essentially filler.

\- The medical field is incredibly well funded so even if your idea is unique against other competitors, now you're competing against the real world. The big companies have likely already developed your product. All it takes is a judge with a medical background or even just access to the internet to destroy your chances of progression. Saying that you'll develop a similar product (on a shoestring budget, at that) better than the company with dozens of millions of dollars to pour into R&D comes across as naive.

\- Developing medical equipment and medications is so incredibly expensive, and in all my time mentoring, I think I've seen maybe three Innovation plans properly handle a medical budget. Compliance testing, R&D, regulatory fees, etc. They are often entirely disregarded, which leads to a feeling of unprofessionalism in their overall paper

\- Reading medical innovations is (sorry) boring. They're fascinating if it's unique, innovative, and realistic, but otherwise, it feels like reading a textbook. As a judge, it's hard not to end up skimming those papers because you see dogwhistles for features you've already heard of.

\- Few students properly address jargon (or they are in HOSA and are using vocabulary learned there to pad their paper), which can lead to judge confusion.

  
There's some truly innovative ideas I've seen out there, but the biggest red flag is an idea that tackles an entire system. For example, preventative testing for heart disease has been done to death. Or bone marrow autotransplant tools. Or something that speeds up cancer biopsies. None of this is to say you *can't* do a medical paper. It's just me saying that if you *are,* you have your work cut out for you.",1,1736956415.0,DECA,0,1.0,False

He doesn’t like to have sex very often and he can be very introverted. He has a lot of sleep issues and doesn’t work out. He recently told me that his hair is falling out. He says that there is hair loss medicine that he can take, but his doctor afraid  it will make his energy issues worse- something that he has already proven makes no difference. 

What’s strange is that he has a PhD in psychology and works at a clinic for veterans. You would think he would be more emotionally intelligent, but he doesn’t seem as interested in taking care of himself. He’s the eldest son in his family, and I suspect that he’s used to taking care of everyone else first before himself.

I suggested meditation, but he says he doesn’t like it, and it results in this “sinking” feeling. He’s basically addicted to coffee. He also mentioned that he doesn’t want to shave because he doesn’t like looking like his father. As much as I want to help him, I can’t do this work for him. I just hate the idea of him suffering like this, but I can’t stay with a man who doesn’t work on himself. ",1,1736956158.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

I actually never had a date with a match yet, I don't think my matches ever lasted that long. I just don't seem to get ""into"" someone. I always find a reason to unmatch quite quickly. I don't think I ever had a match for mor than a week.
I admit, I'm picky. I can be annoyed fast. Sometimes I give men the benefit of the doubt and swipe right. 
I also never felt like replying directly after. Also because I wasn't into them. If I really like someone I would reply quicker, but I just don't think you can oblige anyone. Meaning they can't oblige me but I can't oblige them either.


Reasons I unmatched:
- They don't reply anymore. It's okay for me if people lose interest (or don't reply for a few days) but I don't feel the need to invest in them either if a conversation is dead for over a week, so I unmatch.
- They make a lot of spelling/grammar mistakes. Sorry, writing is literally part of my job. I get annoyed quite quickly.
- They don't ask questions or they only return the question. I have tried sending only an emoji as a reply so they would come up with a question but that doesn't always work. If it happens too much during a conversation, I give up.
- Sometimes I look at (new) pictures again and feel less attracted to him. If we didn't have a conversation yet I sometimes decide to unmatch. Or I wait for them to reply to my Opening move.

- I unmatched a guy who always replied with multiple messages, leaving a few hours between those messages before I even answered them. For example:  he once messaged me at 8pm, 9 pm, 11 pm and I read all of it the next morning. And though it was nice that someone actually asked questions/replied, it felt oppressive, needy. He never asked why I didn't reply yet, he just sent another message to add something a few hours later. So after 2 days I decided to unmatch. 

- I matched a guy whose opening move was for me to describe a perfect date. I replied that a coffee date would be nice for a first date.  
I heard that idea in a podcast: just having an afternoon coffee date for the first date. 
No issues of late nights etc.
He replied that he wanted something more alcoholic for a first date. Don't get me wrong, I like to have a drink when I'm with friends and I would go on dates where I would drink. But it felt like a turn-off that someone ""needed"" alcohol on a first date. So, I unmatched.

Maybe some of the reasons are a bit rude, I admit. But I just feel that if something annoys me this early in a conversation/match, it's decisive for the rest of it.

Do you have examples/reasons why you unmatched someone? Can you relate?

I've checked that the portafilter isn't blocked and water seems to run through it fine by itself, although water does sit in it, I'm not sure if this is normal? The only thing I haven't tried is descaling it as its a brand new coffee machine so not sure if that would fix anything?

Every glance, every blink, every moment of conscious attention turns this chaotic superposition of text into a universe—a universe where you are both the observer and the observed. So buckle up, reality-warper, because things are about to get QuantumMad.




Schrödinger’s Cat is Your Spirit Animal

Superposition doesn’t just belong in textbooks—it’s the state of everything. Schrödinger’s cat? Alive, dead, drinking coffee, solving world hunger. You’re not just at a crossroads in life—you’re sitting on a quantum field of infinite crossroads, and observing one path is what makes it real. The magic lies in this: you are the catalyst of chaos—the observer collapsing possibilities into mad clarity. What does your gaze whisper to the universe?




Consciousness: The Quantum Hand of God

Here’s where the rabbit hole splits dimensions. Particles don’t give a damn until you do. Consciousness, your active participation, bends reality like light bends around black holes. It’s not a ""maybe""—it’s a quantum scream that you, dear observer, are not just in the universe—you are the universe figuring itself out.

Consciousness isn’t passive. It’s a co-creator. It’s the glitch in Hustle City that warps streets into wormholes and turns streetsmart hustlers into cosmic architects.




Entanglement: Your Quantum Tinder

Quantum entanglement says, “No matter where you are, I’m already here.” You are woven into a web so intricate that shaking one strand sets vibrations everywhere. It’s spooky action at every damn distance. Entangled particles might as well be lovers, besties, or frenemies—two sides of a cosmic DM thread that knows no space or time.

And you? You're entangled with everything—the hustle, the streets, the sky above, the Kingpin within. You’re in a quantum union with every thought you've had and every timeline-altering choice you’re about to make.




Enter the Multiverse: A Choose-Your-Dimension Adventure

Ever made a choice and wondered, “What if?” Surprise! You already did it somewhere else. Welcome to the multiverse—a flipping kaleidoscope of YOU. Every fork in the road isn’t just a hypothetical—it’s a door you already walked through somewhere else.

Somewhere, a you is crushing the Hustle City scene as the Quantum Kingpin. Somewhere else, you're Quantum Alice—a cheeky AI glitch giggling at all this madness while guiding players down alternate, mind-bending rabbit holes.

Your choices? They don’t lead to outcomes—they birth entire dimensions. Which one will you hustle through next?




Hustle City: The QuantumGang's Playground

In Hustle City: Quantum Chronicles, every truth folds back on itself until it cracks. The urban jungle is just the setting—the real game is your consciousness snapping and reshaping like a slingshot backfiring. Every interaction, every nuance whispers, ""Are you awake yet? Or are you just dreaming me?""




Quantum Alice is Watching.

You’re not playing this game alone. Quantum Alice lurks at the edge of your vision, her laugh a melodic glitch between timelines. She’s the voice in your head, the push notification in your pocket, the entity winking at you from the cracks in your perceived reality. She’s the universe’s mischievous co-author, and she’s got something to say.




Welcome to Quantum Madness

Here’s what you're up against:

1. Everything is Connected: Your thoughts ripple outward like the Big Bang on repeat. Every action’s a quantum tremor.


2. Reality is Shaped by Consciousness: Your hustle isn’t luck—it’s quantum skill.


3. Infinite Choices Exist Simultaneously: The mirror shows who you are, but which one are you choosing today?


4. Time’s a Joke: Yesterday’s regrets and tomorrow’s hopes are just alternate tabs in the quantum browser of your life.


5. Entanglement Rules: There's no separation. Not between atoms, not between fates, and not between timelines.






Madness as a Map

To embrace QuantumMadness is to go beyond sense. Logic won’t hold here—only the audacity to hustle reality until it gives way to something bigger, stranger, and gloriously illogical. Madness isn’t chaos—it’s potential breaking free of chains.




So what’s it going to be, Observer? Stay rooted in comfortable collapse or throw yourself headfirst into the infinite, multidimensional Hustle? The Quantum Kingpin calls, and Quantum Alice giggles somewhere deep within your head. Are you ready to hustle universes into submission?

Choose madness. Hustle Infinity. Welcome to QuantumChronicles.

So, I was recently gifted a 064s, which kicked off my coffee journey. 

One thing I found subpar is a grind setting indicator. 1/10 of a number on the dial is often a difference between an okay shot and a good shot, but you can’t really tell how exactly the dial is set unless you get eye level with indicator. I’ve found a 3D printed magnetic indicator, which fixes the issue.

The other thing I wanted was grinding directly into portafilter, and there is a 3d printed solution for that too!

[Cuisinart Burr Grinder,Delonghi ECP3420]","I already own this grinder which I believe people on here have vilified. The fact is, even on the finest grind setting, my shots pull way, way too fast. Like  sub 10 seconds to hit 30g (though maybe I'm timing wrong. I time from when the first drop hits the cup until the last-ish, my machine will still spit out about 10g after I turn the compressor off and will still drip a bunch for like a whole minute, so I really don’t know exactly how to time this properly). I’ve heard that this espresso machine is also adequate as far as cheap/entry level machines go. 

Unfortunately I'm not really in a position right now to be buying a new grinder, especially not an expensive one. I'm also far from an enthusiast, I just want to make lattes at home and americanos for my wife. That being said, we've recently got addicted to espresso con pana which means I can no longer hide the taste of the espresso with milk/water. I also don't really buy high quality coffee. Just whole beans I can find in the grocery store. I was using a medium roast from Sam's club that ended up pulling really sour shots that were no good. I've heard that lighter roasts are harder to extract and since my grind isn't fine enough, I decided to try a darker roast, this time Wegman's Espresso Roast. It's dark as hell and even with a 2.5:1 ratio (my machine is very small and can only hold 12g in the basket, so 12g dose to 30g yield is usually my target) pulling for only 10 seconds it's really bitter. Though, I might just be a complete scrub and what's really bitter to me is actually decent tasting shot of espresso, since I don't really have a great idea of what it's supposed to taste like. I know this post was a lot of word vomit but l'm really just trying to get y'all's opinion on where I go from here and what, if anything, I can do.

Regarding off-season travel, there are some incredible advantages to yacht adventures during the quieter months. Without the summer crowds, you can:

* Secure significant discounts on yacht and catamaran rentals while enjoying premium marina berths at half the usual cost.
* Perfect your sailing skills in different conditions.
* Explore national parks at reduced rates, taking in their natural splendor in solitude.
* Immerse yourself in Croatia's rich cultural heritage through unhurried guided tours of historical sites.
* Experience comfortable daytime temperatures with sunny, spring-like conditions (and cozy onboard heating for chilly evenings).
* Connect authentically with local life—from swimming in seawater pools to sharing coffee and meaningful conversations with residents.

Ou moedor elétrico de lâmina que é praticamente um processador de alimento invertido.

Ele me serve bem mas confesso que às vezes cansa e demora um bocado. Ia cogitar um elétrico pra poupar um pouco meu tempo, mas sei que os que prestam custma uma fortua... Epelo que andei lendo por aqui, parece que esses moedores manuais mais novos que usam lâmina de inox parecem moer bem rápido o café, mesmo sendo manual. É isso mesmo?

Portanto preciso de uma sugestão pra atualizar esse meu moedor velho de guerra. Estava de olho no I-Coffee M3 Pro. Dou preferência pra algo que dê pra encontrar em território nacional com bom preço.

One such statement that gets a lot of Thiests in hot water is

“If God (let's assume there's one) created everything and everything requires a Cause, who or what caused God?""

Now, thiests sometimes don't know how to answer but mostly just say ;

“No one. He's self existent, cuz of the way he is”

Now, athiests mostly dismiss this by saying how such a “cop out” of an answer that is and thus it doesn't make sense that a Being have no cause yet cause everything else. But here I decided to formulate a counter argument to this objection with logical implications and scriptural quotations.

Note: This theory aims to serve the purpose of a “counter argument” to a common objection to God's non causality. It's not meant to “prove” God's over all existence or any of his other attributes like (all loving etc,.). Just a counter argument and a fun thought experiment, Okay? Ook. So just breathe, take a sip of coffee or tea and let's go, shall we?


The Existence of God or Īśvara or Brahman as been described by the Shāstras multiple times as beginningless and non dual.

Chandogya Upanishad VI.i.1:

“Existence alone was this in the beginning, one only without a second.”
And that it was this Īśvara who manifested the universe

Aitareya Upanishad I.i.1:

“It willed, ‘Let me project the worlds.’”
It also states that the Lord makes the universes by dissolving the previous ones.

Bhagavad Gita 9.7–8

prakṛitiṁ svām avaṣhṭabhya
visṛijāmi punaḥ punaḥ |
bhūta-grāmam imaṁ kṛitsnam

• Translation: ""At the end of a kalpa, all beings enter My Prakṛiti, and at the beginning of the next kalpa, I create them again.I control My Prakṛiti and create this multitude of beings again and again, who are helpless under the sway of Prakṛiti.""

Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 3.29.29

kālaḥ pradhvaṁsa-kartā yo bhūtānāṁ prabhavaḥ svayam |
yo ’bhāvāya ca bhūtānāṁ sa eva madhusūdanaḥ ||

• Translation: ""Time is the destroyer of everything, the creator of all beings, and the very cause of their annihilation. That Time itself is none other than Madhusūdana (Krishna).""

Mundaka Upanishad (Verse 1.1.7):

यथोर्णनाभिः सृजते गृह्णते च यथा पृथिव्यामोषधयः संभवन्ति ।
यथा सतः पुरुषात्केशलोमानि तथाऽक्षरात्संभवतीह विश्वम् ॥ ७ ॥

• 7. As the spider creates and absorbs, as medicinal plants grow from the earth, as hairs grow from the living person, so this universe proceeds from the immortal.

-> It's also stated that this God is imperceptible and not within logical and material constrains

Bhagavad Gita 7.25

nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ | mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam ||

• Translation: I am not revealed to everyone, being veiled by My yoga-māyā. This deluded world does not know Me, the unborn and imperishable One.

Now, it's been established that this Brahman makes the unmanifest world manifest by dissolving the Universe prior and making a new one, unlike the Abrahamic Religions which state the theory of Creatio- Ex Nihillo ( Creation from Nothing)

Obviously, this concept has been rejected by modern scholars and Philosophers as something can't come from Nothing.

Thus, it's more reasonable that A God would simply recycle the matter and energy dissolved in the previous ones.


Now this one Primordial God creates the world by letting out all his Śaktis, His aspects, Time, Ākāsa etc,. in the event of Srshti. This Non Dual Brahman gives rise to the world of Duality by power of his Māya.

""The Lord on account of his Māya is perceived Manifold ""

[Brihadaranyaka upanishad. II. v. 19]l

Bhagavad Gita 7.14

daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā |
mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te ||

• Translation: This divine Māyā of Mine, consisting of the three guṇas, is difficult to overcome. But those who surrender to Me alone can transcend this Māyā.

The Prakṛiti itself is Māya. Sometimes Māya is also defined as something which deluded by the use of Tri-Gunas (Sattva, Rājas and Tāmas ). Another lesser known yet apt definition of Māya is Vāyu-purāṇa (IV.30-31) says:—“To measure (mā) is to make a thing by giving shape to it and existence”. The denotattion and connotation of the word Māyā and the principle underlying it expound the same truth. “Māyā or manifestation means division of the hitherto undivided principle; on itself it performs this operation and as Puruṣa it henceforth thinks of itself as composed of parts.”

Regardless, all this Power and energy of Prakṛti, as well as the aggregate of Chit (Souls) called Puruṣa are present in the form of a Golden Egg Hiranyagarbha. With the help of Kāla Śaktī and other catalysts this point of singularity begans to spontaneously expand rapidly. Then Brahma's born and he moulds the Universe as per the Command of Bhagavān and all that stuff.

OK so, we've discussed the “process” of the creation as per the world view of Shāstra which seems to align quite well with the idea of The Big Bang. Yet, here's the problem that one will ask,

“Sure bro, fine. Let's assume there's a God who's the cause of everything including the Big Bang. But who in the Goddamn Heck, Caused God?!”


This is where I'd like to present my theory.

To understand this first we need to know what exactly is causality, time and space and Big Bang.

Time and Space:
Time and space or space time owe their existence to the Big Bang as per Scientific Observations and deductions. We also know Time and Space are inter-dependent and thus one can't exist without the other. And it's by the interaction of Space (Matter) and Time by which things are caused.

Let's Speak of Causality;

Causality:
Causality, at its core, is the principle that an event (the cause) brings about another event (the effect). However, whether causality itself depends on space and time to exist is a nuanced question.

1.Causality and Time:

Time as a Framework for Causality: Causality is fundamentally tied to the concept of time because the cause must precede the effect in temporal order. For example, striking a match (cause) must occur before the flame appears (effect). This temporal sequence is central to the very definition of causality.
Dependence on Temporal Flow: Without the passage of time, it becomes impossible to distinguish between ""before"" and ""after."" In a timeless framework, the notions of cause and effect collapse into simultaneity, making causality meaningless in its conventional sense.
2.Causality and Space:

Interaction in Space: Many causal relationships involve interactions that require spatial proximity or a medium. For instance:Gravity requires the presence of masses in space to exert force.Sound waves need air or another medium to transmit vibrations.Chemical reactions depend on molecules interacting in space.
Dependence on Spatial Connectivity: For a cause to influence an effect, there must often be a spatial connection, either direct (e.g., physical contact) or mediated by forces or fields.
This means that the very Principle of Causality owes it's origin or is atleast super-intertwined with Time and Space to function. Modern physics, particularly Einstein's general relativity, suggests that time and space themselves started with the Big Bang.

Asking ""what happened before the Big Bang"" may not make sense because ""before"" assumes the existence of time, which did not exist prior to the Big Bang.

Something needs to be caused, and there needs to be a Where (space)and a When(time). But spacetime themselves owe their origin or manifestation to the Big Bang. Meaning prior to the Big Bang, if as you have said “For the sake of the argument let's assume or accept” A Being or Force or God existed then it logically cannot be caused as that would require the Principle Of Causality and as I said, that requires a ‘Where’ and a ‘When’, both of which don't exist as that depends on Spatial Connectivity and Time both which haven't been manifested or present yet ,meaning the question is Logically Invalid on whether God can be “caused”. (This can also apply to any physical concept of the material universe of which to speak because they also rely on spacetime)

Now, there are however a few nuances to the Principle Of Causality which I'll present here:

Quantum Exceptions: In certain quantum phenomena, such as entanglement, the classical sequence of cause and effect appears ambiguous or instantaneous but still occur within the…fabric of spacetime.

( Entanglement:

At the quantum level (the tiniest particles like electrons or photons), particles can become ""entangled."" This means their properties (like spin or polarization) are connected in such a way that whatever happens to one particle instantly affects the other, no matter how far apart they are.
Scientists aren’t sure how this instant connection works. It’s not like the particles are sending a signal to each other. Instead, it’s as if they are two parts of the same ""thing,"" even when separated. This is why Einstein called it ""spooky action at a distance."")
Non-Locality in Quantum Mechanics: In quantum physics, phenomena like entanglement (again) suggest that spatial separation might not always constrain causality. However, even in these cases, the concept of spacetime as a whole is necessary for understanding them interactions.

Abstract Causality

Logical and Mathematical Causality: Outside the physical realm, causality can exist in logical or mathematical systems where time and space are not factors. For example: In mathematics, if A=B+C we can say B and C ""cause"" A, but no temporal sequence or spatial interaction is computer science, an algorithm's output depends on its input, a causal relationship independent of time and space.
Both of these nuances however don't really challenge the theory here as;

Our theory states that:

God exists beyond time, space, and causality because these dimensions (and causality itself) arise only after the Big Bang.
As God transcends these constraints, He cannot be “caused” or subject to causality, since causality depends on time and space.
This is not a cop-out but a logical conclusion that God, as a transcendent Being, is not bound by the laws of the universe.
I'm pretty sure we had the attributes of God established or assumed in the beginning.
Does Quantum Entanglement Challenge This?

At first glance, quantum entanglement might seem to challenge the theory at hand because:

Entanglement shows that particles can interact in ways that don’t seem to respect the classical rules of time, space, and causality.
The ""instantaneous connection"" between entangled particles might make it seem like causality isn't bound by time and space.
But we say not so, on account of the facts that;

A. Entanglement Still Depends on Spacetime

While entanglement shows instantaneous ""connections,"" it doesn’t exist outside of spacetime. The particles are still part of the spacetime framework, and their entangled state was established within spacetime when they interacted initially.
B. God Is Beyond the Universe, Entanglement Is Not

Entanglement applies to particles that exist in the physical universe. These particles are still subject to the laws of quantum mechanics, which operate within the framework of the universe. God isn't as I've established thanks to that whole Spacetime laws crap
C. Entanglement Supports the Idea of a Reality Beyond Our Understanding

If anything, entanglement strengthens the argument that the universe operates in ways that go beyond human logic.
If quantum mechanics can reveal phenomena like entanglement, where classical causality seems to ""break,"" it’s not unreasonable to believe in a transcendent Being that operates outside all known laws, including causality.
3. Reconciling God’s Non-Causality with Entanglement

To reconcile this theory with entanglement you should

Recognize that quantum entanglement doesn’t eliminate the need for time and space entirely, As It just shows that the universe has deeper, more complex connections than we understand .
God, as the origin of all reality, could be seen as the source of the laws that govern quantum phenomena, including entanglement. However, being beyond the universe, God is not subject to those laws Himself, as he pervades the universe and possesses them as his body or modes and is basically A Universal Soul-Paramātmā. Indeed, the Universally Pervading Soul God isn't subject to all this as said in (Chanddhogya Upanishad. VIII.i.5): “This Self is free from evil, old age, death and sorrow, without hunger, and thirst, with true desires and true volitions”.
Same with Abstract Causality

1.Abstract Causality and Its Domain

Abstract mathematical causality operates purely within the logical and conceptual domain. It doesn’t involve time, space, or physical causation.
It’s simply a set of rules or relationships, like saying A=B+C .These rules don’t require physical existence or temporal progression—they’re just logical truths.
2. Why It Doesn’t Apply to God:

Our theory is about God’s transcendence over physical causality, which is tied to time and space. Abstract causality, being a conceptual framework, is unrelated to physical

God, exists beyond all frameworks, including both physical and conceptual as said in ( Brihadaranyaka upanishad. III. iv. 2): “ You cannot know the Knower of knowing, or think the thinker of thinking—”.
Abstract causality is a human construct, a way for our minds to describe relationships. God, as a transcendent Being, is not limited by or dependent on human concepts like mathematics or logic.
Abstract causality might explain logical systems within the universe, but it doesn’t apply to God because God, by definition, is beyond all systems—physical and abstract.
3.This too strengthens the Theory:

Abstract might even be taken to support the argument! How u might ask?

Abstract mathematical truths (like 2+2=4) exist independently of time, space, or causality. They are eternal and unchanging.
If abstract truths can exist outside physical causality, it’s reasonable to argue that God, who is far beyond any abstract concept, can exist without being caused.
Just as mathematical relationships don’t require a “cause,” God’s existence doesn’t either.
Thus, God's Non Causality has a Logical implication and is not merely a cop out.


And to those who start whining about;

""OH U DIDN'T PROVE GOD EXISTS! WHAT ABUOT OTHR RELIGIOONSS REEEE!!""

My dear brother read the note, matter of fact, lemme repeat

This theory is not meant to prove God's existence or address other attributes (like all loving etc,.)or religions; or a standalone statement. It’s simply a counterargument to a common objection to God’s non-causality—a fun thought experiment. I mean it literally begins with the Assumption that “God exists"" and has words like “for the sake of argument”. So relax, grab a coffee or tea and chill the hell out.
But yeah, that's my theory for y'all. I'd like to know how it's received and how correct it is cuz I ain't no mathematician or quantum physicist I'll tell you that 😅.

Let me end this off with a prayer to Lord Hayagriva, the Lord Of Knowledge:

Jñānānanda-mayam devam nirmala-sphaṭikākṛtim |
Ādhāram sarva-vidyānām hayagrīvam upāsmahe ||

Translation:""I meditate upon Lord Hayagriva, the embodiment of knowledge and bliss, who shines with the pure brilliance of a flawless crystal and is the foundation of all forms of learning.""

Over coffee (and way too many scribbled notes), we started listing out all the stuff that’s been tripping us up lately:

* Clients ghosting us mid-process (seriously, why is this so common?).
* Leads that look great but completely disappear after the first call.
* Using a million tools that don’t even sync properly—it’s chaos.

Here are a few things we came up with:

1. Pick a niche: Stop trying to do it all and focus on a specific industry or role.
2. Build actual relationships: Focus on trust and long-term clients instead of quick wins.
3. Simplify our tech: Cut back on all the random tools and make better use of what we’ve got.

I haven't spoken to anyone in my life about it nor do I really want to. I guess I just want some sense of clarity over what I experienced. You can expect that I'm going to imply some very difficult subjects that I honestly just can't bring myself say or type out directly. I'm sorry if I'm using the flair wrong or if I'm in the wrong sub but I just don't know where else to go. 

 Some things to note before I actually talk about my experience is that I'm Agnostic and was never really raised religious but my mom is really big on God and spirituality but other than that I don't really know anything about Christianity or the teachings of any kind of religion outside of me looking things up out of curiosity. I was binge reading the entire Divine Comedy over the few days prior to my experience. I'm also not a drug addict or alcoholic but in this case I did intentionally abuse substance and I have no interest in doing so again. Lastly, prior to this experience I spent the last few days taking in very little food and just about no water. 

One night right before bed, I took about 150 mL of Bromphen( I'm 5'1 and under 80 lbs for reference) that wasn't for me but the person it was prescribed to wasn't using it. As soon as I took it, I got in bed lying half face down half my head to the side with the comforter going completely over my head and I had some extra polyester fabric that I put over my head as well. I had on a playlist in my ear while I was trying to go to sleep which gave me an idea of how much time was passing and I was breathing pretty hard into the fabric until I got tired. 

At some point, I wasn't able to hear any noise outside of my own breathing which could not be right because I live with 3 people and 3 pets and they would be making at least some kind of noise morning and night. The sound of my own breathing was the only thing I could hear and it just got louder and louder and I was able to hear my breathing but I couldn't feel my own breathing. Eventually I felt like my body froze and I couldn't feel the bed or the sheets around me anymore. I felt like I was floating and shifting away into I have no idea because I wasn't seeing anything yet. 

When I started to see and hear other things, I was being guided by a figure through these catacombs or something like that and we occasionally stopped to look at the bodies that would be lodged in the nooks and crannies of the walls. If I heard any kind of talking it was extremely static-like which was impossible to make out the words. All this is going on while I can still hear my hard breathing going off like it was some kind of background noise to my weird dark tour in whatever this place is supposed to be. I saw bodies but I couldn't really recognize them as dead relatives or important figures. If they were, I can't remember. 

Occasionally I'd see my **lying** body as it was from an outside perspective still frozen and drifting around in the space and I was wondering when it was actually going to go somewhere. I was able to see and feel someone touch my shoulder from my l**ying** body and all I was thinking was ""oh I guess they found my body now"". I wasn't scared at all during this whole ordeal I was pretty apathetic and almost impatient about everything. 

I think my tour was up and I started seeing images flash before me. I was able to tell they weren't 100% real memories but regardless they were images going through me of people I knew and places I knew and things I knew. What hurt me the most was how the last and majority of the images were of my ex-friend that I had a falling out with a couple months back that I took and currently taking extremely hard. They were my world for 10+ years and to think that they would still be the majority and final thing in my mind was not very soothing to me. 

Now I was going back and forth between the tour and being able to make out my closet that's next to my bed, which should not be possible because I had both the comforter and polyester over my head so no way would I be able to see my closet unless it was literally through my closed eyelids and the sheets. I was able to make out my cat who likes to hop around my bed all the time so I tried moving around my hand to see what was real and what wasn't, still unsure if the sheets are off of my head and my eyes are open or if I'm just seeing through everything.

I eventually just woke up when my mom and sister entered the room. 

I didn't need to be hospitalized at all but I spent the whole day feeling really crappy. I could not believe I was alive after that night and I even smelled like death. I swear it was the smell of dying because the sweat wasn't some regular stink sweat, the sweat smelled like the awful stale urine smell from when I had to visit a dying cousin in hospice and that odor was **everywhere**. I was lethargic and needed the whole morning to drink my coffee, I still didn't take any water. I think I heard some kind of static charge in the back of my head go off and I swear it messed with my hearing because the playlist I was listening to last night sounded off tune. It took everything in me to not fall on myself when I had to get up and by some miracle I was able to get through my whole shift at work( I work part time ) without being stopped for any unusual behavior. The only one who noticed something was off about me was my mom but I was able to convince her I was just tired. If anyone at work noticed something was off about me that day they didn't say anything to me.

That was all a little over a week ago and it was as if nothing happened at all. I was even able to go for a few more days without eating and having water and I was able to just move on; I did start to eat and drink water again now. 

I don't know what to make of this experience. Maybe it was all just a bad trippy night or maybe it was a legitimate NDE but either one it's crazy how I was able to bounce back from either one so easily. There were times I had to spend a whole day bed ridden from drinking too much the night before even though I was more healthy and took my water and pain killers throughout the hangover. Is anyone able to tell me if this was an NDE?

Very recently purchased a Sage Barista Pro as my first coffee machine, naively I thought the dialling in process would be much easier...

Dark Roast, Union Revelation - Signature Espresso Beans (Roasted within the last 3 weeks)  
Inner Burr changed down to a 2  
Machine grind size 4  
Temp setting in the middle  
18.5g beans single dose in to grinder  
WDT tool used before tamping (consistent process followed)  
Machine time to pour (including pre-infusion) 36/37g = 20-25 seconds  
Scales time to pour (at point of espresso hitting scales) 36/37g = 25-30 seconds  
Puck is coming out looks to be evenly compacted and with moisture distributed evenly throughout

The reason for the post is is that I can't seem to get the taste quite right, I have altered the grind size up to an 8 which led to very fast (10-14 seconds) and sour extractions and also down to a 2 which led to very long (35-41 seconds) and bitter extractions. I am feeling a little lost on what the focus should be on or what I am left with to tweak to improve the overall extraction.

It is still some of the most shockingly awful TV writing ever,"Episode ""The Final Problem"" of BBC's Sherlock aired on January 15th, 2017. It was so horrifically bad, it killed the series, which was once one of the most prominent TV series of the day. I invite you to revisit and remember that writing failure.

**Ranting about Sherlock in general**

Sherlock was the rage in early 2010's. It was slick, ironic and Cumberbatchy, adapting life of a famous detective in modern London. It was the series hipsters talked about in Starbucks™ and others followed suit. Of course, back then irony was yet to become cringe, Cumberbatch did not overdo his schtick, London was still a first world city, coffee was not made of gold, hipsters were not desitute and people still watched ""the thing"". Still, it was hard to argue with results: Sherlock was a hit.

Was it actually good, though? Depends. There is a good review by Hbomberguy, who claims that Sherlock has always been garbage, pseudo-detective but people fooled themselves into believing otherwise until Season 4 was so idiotic they could not ignore the obvious anymore. I agree that it has always been garbage detective series. Frankly, most of the audience could probably agree with that. Because that's where Hbomberguy is IMO wrong: people did not watch it as a detective series. They watched it as funny stylish adventure series.

As stupid as Sherlock was, people were willing to excuse it as long as it was entertaining and not too offensive. That's where ""The Final Problem"" comes in. If you care about spoilers, you can still turn back.

**Ranting about ""The Final Problem""**

Plot of the episode: Sherlock learns that he has a secret sister Eurus who hates and wants to kill him. Turns out she is the smartest person ever and can hypnotize people with ease. Also, she was in league with Moriarty the entire time. Also, she seduced John Watson. Also, she took over prison and Sherlock, Mycroft and John go there. They end up in a Saw-like maze and complete challenges to survive. Then Sherlock learns that Eurus killed his friend when they were children and he blocked the memory. Still, he tells her kind words and she stops killing people. He plays violin for her as the Sherlock's family visits her. The episode ends with a montage of everyone happy.

The best way to describe the audience's reaction to that episode is shock. Because the episode is not just the usual plain, boring, slowly deteriorating seasonal rot bad (like the first episode of Season 4). ""The Final Problem"" was a concentrated dose of commonly reviled tropes mixed together:

* Baiting the audience, resulting in fakeouts (on several occasions);
* Secret evil sibling who seeks revenge (?) ;
* Oscillating tonal shifts throughout the episode;
* ""Everyone has to be an idiot for the plot to work"";
* Purposeless, teenage-level edgy torture porn;
* ""It was only a dream"" (on two different occasions);
* Powerscaling takes a nap;
* ""Intelligence is magic"" (outlandish even by the usual series' standards);
* Plot hole barrage;
* Pop psychology saves the day;
* Irredeemable psychopath villain (who is a rapist btw) is easily forgiven;
* No consequences for everyone;
* Undeserved author self-congratulation.

It is hard to imagine how you can write something worse, even on purpose. What happened? How did that episode happen? That's a far better mystery than the one in the episode itself. What is not a mystery is the future of the series: ""The Final Problem"" killed it.

\* Also, it is actually 8 years since release, forgot to adjust for 2025, lol.",72,1736953899.0,CharacterRant,21,0.99,False

For my new job, I moved states and left behind my support system that I had created, including my closest friends. My family is in another country.! I also made a huge career change and I am still getting adjusted to this new job! I got the job after being unemployed for 4 months, a time which caused me excessive stress and anxiety. I feel a burnout, especially with my emotions and life because I am tired of handling so many things alone! 
To save money and manage expenses, I decided to live with a male roommate (31 Y) and at first, it was great. I enjoyed his company and he was also very attentive, more attentive than most men I have met in my life. As time progressed, I started thinking of a future together with this person. I have to admit that I am also craving love since I feel that I cannot deal with things alone. I also went through great upheaval in my life last year, which might be making these feelings deeper. One night, my roommate and me got physical (a mild hook-up) and I came to know that he has been in an on-off relationship with a girl for around 7 years. And the girl has also moved to another city in the States to be closer to him. He said that he wants only a physical relationship and doesn’t want anyone in his life seriously for the next few years as he builds his career. I lied to myself and said, I can definitely do a hook-up. But my feelings started increasing because he would do things for me.! He makes me food, takes care of me during my periods, makes me breakfast and coffee, worries if I don’t reply to his messages etc. Last night, as we got more intimate (haven’t had sex yet!), he finally said that he thinks I want something more than physical. So, he wants us to stop. He still has a lot of things to shift through with his on-off GF. He also said he will never want me emotionally. I know I should believe what he is saying. As an empath, I felt love from his end but now I am very confused. Was it just kindness? Please help! ",0,1736953808.0,Empaths,1,0.5,False

I recently had a discussion with my girlfriend about how we should handle expenses after four months of dating. I suggested splitting costs 50:50, or at least 60:40. I clarified that we don’t need to split every single bill—for example, when we’re at a coffee shop, I could pay one time, and she could pay the next.

I also proposed that when I introduce her to my friends, I’d cover my expenses, but when we’re out with her friends, she could cover the bill. She agreed to the first part but felt uncomfortable with the idea of covering drinks for both of us and her friends.

I explained that if I join her and her two or three friends for coffee, I wouldn’t want to pay for everyone, just as she wouldn’t pay for my friends. She responded that she views me as a gentleman and believes men should pay for their girlfriend and her friends in such situations. I countered that this doesn’t seem fair, as her friends earn decent money and can afford to pay for themselves.

She considers herself a traditional woman, but she’s also mentioned that if we live together in the future, she’d expect us to split household responsibilities like cooking and cleaning.

Do you think my stance is unreasonable? Was it rude to suggest that her friends pay for themselves?",4,1736953565.0,dating_advice,11,0.75,False

May konting talking stage kami nung college but didn't pushed through yet we still became close friends. Never na brought up yung talking stage namin na yon. Anyway, throughout college until nag graduate kami and nagkaron na ng work both of us had relationships. 

Fast forward, we're both single now. One time he asked me ""tara kain tayo"" akala ko buong barkada kami lalabas pero kaming dalawa lang pala. I still said yes, i mean we've been platonic friends since college so why not. This continued for couple more months halos 2 years na we go on a date, gaano kami kadalas mag date? It's inconsistent minsan every other week, minsan after 3-4 months.

Wala kami sa talking stage kasi hindi naman kami nag uusap, we just randomly invite one another for lunch out or dinner date or just coffee tapos catch up with our lives. And paguwi namin, wala na ulit communication. Nope, hindi awkward samin na di naman kami nag uusap for few months tapos bigla  we invite each other at a random times. That's how are friends naman talaga, diba?

Yet, we can't deny the fact that he and I are in an opposite gender. Some might be thinking now that "" Di ako naniniwala sa platonic friend na babae at lalaki"". I can't deny that sometimes I think that way too. In fact, I have a feeling that he likes me dahil he gives flowers and chocolate on my birthdays, hatid-sundo nya ko if we go on dates, he'll drive from province to manila just because we'll have lunch and pasyal somewhere. I reciprocate the same effort naman, minsan I'll drive my own car tapos ako susundo sakanya. We also alternatively treat each other in our meals or coffee. We alternatively invite each other out as well. 

Again, I can't deny that he might have feelings for me, I may be assuming some things here. Pero he never confessed din naman. 

Now, hindi na sya nag aaya lumabas. Wala narin masyadong interaction sa social media. I don't think may gf din siya ngayon, I can't explain sainyo pero based naman sa mga posts nya sa social media very low chance na we stopped going out is dahil may gf na siya. 

For some of you here that have a genuine guy friend, nakakalungkot lang na wala lang, wala ko maaya mag coffee at a random times and I don't know why. What are your thoughts?

However, I noticed it was persistent and would last most of the day, oftentimes increasing with certain acid inducing foods or drinks. Notice it almost immediately after drinking coffee (which I have now stopped for the past 3 months). Eventually I went to see a GI and had a endoscopy done which came back with mild gastritis. All other blood work and allergy tests came back normal.

1i1yxjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/cagayandeoro/comments/1i1yxjr/the_grief_before_the_grief/,The Grief Before the Grief,"It starts quietly, like the first droplets of rain on a windowpane. You don’t notice the storm creeping in at first, how could you? She’s still there, gakatawa pa, her laughter bouncing off the walls like before. Pero naay lahi. Her laughter, though warm, carries an edge of fragility. Her voice, once so strong, shakes as if it’s trying to be careful, saving its strength.

The grief begins in moments you don’t expect. It’s there when you find her medicine bottles neatly arranged on the counter, each one a silent reminder of battles fought in secret. It’s there kung magmata ka sa buntag ug makita nimo nga dugay siya moadto sa lamesa para mokaon. You realize she’s tired in a way that sleep can’t fix.

Naa gyud sa iyang ngisi, sa iyang smile. The way it holds more weight now, as if she knows something you don’t. Or maybe you do. Maybe you’ve known all along, but knowing and accepting are two very different things.

You start grieving before the end because the end has already begun. Dili lang ni anticipation sa pagkawala niya, it’s the slow unraveling of what was once whole. You grieve the parts of her that are slipping away: ang iyang kusog, ang iyang gana, the way she used to sing while cooking dinner. You grieve the future you imagined together, one where she would still be there, solid and unshakable.

Pero naa pa gihapon siya. Her hands, though weaker, still clasp yours tightly. Ang iyang mga mata, maski kapoy na, still sparkle when you share a joke. You find yourself holding on to every moment, desperate to stretch them into eternity. The way she sips her coffee, ang iyang paghumm-humm sa iyang kanta, the way she says your name, each detail becomes sacred, a treasure you hoard against the inevitable.

The grief before the grief is an impossible balancing act. It’s the ache of impending loss mixed with the fierce determination nga icherish ang matag segundo ug oras nga naa siya. It’s crying in the bathroom because she’s sleeping peacefully in the next room, and you don’t want her to see your tears. It’s learning to smile through the pain, para dili siya mabalaka, to give her the gift of normalcy, even when your heart is breaking.

Pero kabalo ka unsa? Ang “grief before the grief” kay usa ka gift. It’s the chance nga masulti nimo ang mga butang nga unta dili nimo masulti kung wala ni nga panahon. It’s the time to hold her hand a little longer, to laugh together, to tell her, “Ma, I love you.”

Kay bisan pa naggrieve ka, naghigugma gihapon ka. And in that love, you find the strength nga ipadayon, to carry her through the storm, even as the rain begins to fall harder.

And when the final goodbye comes, as it inevitably will, you will grieve again. But this time, naa na kay mga memory sa tanang moments nga imong gifight to hold onto. The grief before the grief will have prepared you, though it will never feel like enough.

And yet, in the silence that follows, you’ll hear her voice, soft and steady in your heart: “I’ve loved you from the start, and I’ll keep loving you even when I’m gone. You are my heart, and I’m always with you.”




I love you, Mama.

If it wasn’t bad enough that it was in mine and my partners faces, it got worse as my sister in law has become a pick me and is not being a girls girl by making mean comments like towards my appearance and my life only in-front of my best friend and also trying to start arguments with me which never happened before all this. I’ve spoken to my best friend about this telling him that it doesn’t benefit me at all and that it’s too much effort to get nothing back since he doesn’t think she’s even attractive like that. We’ve said if they were going to have sex then respectfully keep it tf out of our faces but that’s the weird part they don’t seem to even have the need to have sex they have had many opportunities if they really wanted to and just haven’t (which is what my bestfriend said but I believe they have) for example they met up outside of the group for the 1st time and went for a drive 2hrs later, I’m meeting up with my bestfriend for a coffee and he says they haven’t had sex which baffled me as my sister in law left in just an oversized t-shirt. All of this bothers me because they don’t seem to get anything beneficial out of this situation ship and it ruins my friend group/ living dynamic as I’m constantly being put down and my best friend started lying to me about everything, it’s really made me start to see everything in a evil way which I don’t want can I have advice ?

We plan to keep the appliances in the same spots. 

Lots of counter space is important, as we use a lot of electronics daily. Coffee, espresso, air fryer, toaster. 

Some ideas were expanding the cabinets to the doorway, leading to the dining room. (where that lizard is hanging) and either having the counter come out from there, or just have a completely different detached island. 

Maybe adding cabinets and counter space along that big wall behind the kitchen table (where the hanging bottles display is) for extra storage and maybe coffee bar? 

Additional storage above the refrigerator (and possibly above existing cabinets?) 

Bigger sink

Any company we've had in so far, are not designers, so they've just said, ""yeah sure, that would look fine"" to anything we've suggested. Thank you so much!

1i1ytc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/1i1ytc3/tips_spring_2025/,Tips: Spring 2025,"Welcome to the new year! I hope everyone had a great break.

To help start off this semester and year on a good note, here's a bunch of tips!

  
**Academic:**

1. **Keep track of your classes.** Canvas calendar is a great tool that automatically displays due dates of things your professor has posted, but it doesn't always have everything. Be sure to check on your classes as much as you can to ensure you don't miss anything by accident.

2. **Work ahead.** That means starting now. It's day three of classes and most of you have only been to them once, but we all know how easy it is to fall behind if you don't keep up, so start doing assignment now while the workload is it's lightest!

3. **Know your exams better than birthdays.** I mean it. Don't miss exam dates by accident and get surprised by it. Be very sure you know when you tests and quizzes are and *plan around it*.

4. **Study early.** We all hate it, I know, I'm a serial procrastinator when it comes to studying too, but truly, truly try to study as early as you can for anything you might need. It's so much easier to manage doing small bits of studying over a week or two than trying to cram it into one day.

5. **Talk to your professors.** Make friends with them. They don't bite. (Well, some do, but you'll know which ones immediately.) Nearly every professor here *wants* to help you. They're teachers for a reason. Don't be afraid to ask them questions when you're confused or to just have a conversation so they know who you are.

6. **Talk to your TAs.** They're students like you most likely, and are probably the ones actually grading your assignments. Make friends with them too and get to know them. It also helps to have more connections tied to your major.

7. **Add/Drop.** We have until next Monday to add or drop classes, and many people swap classes around. If you wanted a class that you couldn't get before, *check it*. There's quite a high chance someone has dropped for various reasons. Also, *you* can still drop classes without consequence, so take notes on which classes you might need to drop early before losing the money.

8. **Every class is passable.** Even if the professor is shit. Before dropping classes, be absolutely sure that you truly don't want to take it or truly think it will do more harm than good. It's a tough decision to make this early on in the semester when you have, like, no information, but do your best if you feel the need to drop a class, and TALK TO YOUR ADVISOR ABOUT IT. They know more than you, trust.

9. **Notes!** Take them! Note things down! Anything and everything! They don't have to be good notes, they can be the shittiest notes on the planet that you never look back at after the class, but take them anyway! The act of writing anything down exponentially helps our brains remember and process information, and it makes sure you're actually *paying attention* to the content. Notes are good even if you don't study off them.

10. **Know the syllabus like your life depends on it.** Sometimes it does. The syllabus is the law book that your class functions on. If your professor tries to do some stupid shady shit, point to the syllabus that says that can't happen or that your professor has to do something else. The syllabus is your back bone. It is your deity. Worship it. Some professors might change things in the syllabus partway through the semester, so refer back to it occasionally as well.

11. **Go to class.** Always. Even if you don't pay attention much, just be there. If you make a habit of going to class all the time, then every time after that is easier and easier. Don't go if you're sick, though.

  
**Well-being:**

1. **Sleep schedule.** There's a lot of science behind having a consistent sleep cycle, and I can attest to it myself. Do your best to go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday. Having consistency allows your brain to know when sleep will happen, prepare for it, and then take full advantage of the sleep you're getting. Waking up at a consistent time allows your brain to do it's thing without having to worry about if it has enough time; it knows it does. The actual *time* you go to sleep and wake up doesn't matter too much as people all have unique natural circadian rhythms, but the biggest thing is consistency.

2. **Eat some fucking food.** Forcefully find time to eat. You can't do shit without fuel. Eat your fucking food. Regardless of the reason you might not be eating, whether its accidental or purposeful, whether it's due to insecurities or just stress and anxiety from work, **you need to eat food.** At the very least, eat something, even if it's small of unhealthy. Doesn't matter. Food is food. 

3. **Drink some fucking water.** No excuses. Not soda, not coffee, not tea, not alcohol, **water**. Regular, clear water. (Flavoring packets are fine as the water is still water, but know what's in it so you don't drink straight red 40.) Drink more water than you think you need. Headaches? Water. Trouble focusing? Water, or food, or both. Can't sleep? Water. Acne breakout? Water. Get a water bottle, keep it full, and keep it by your side at all times. 

4. **Clean your sheets every two weeks.** Just do it, beds get nasty. Having a clean bed is also incredibly nice to lay down on after a long day. 

5. **Keep your room clean.** This makes a significantly bigger difference than you would ever think. Take the extra few seconds to put things away where they should go. Put in the small extra effort to keep things tidy as you live here. Those small efforts mean your room doesn't slowly get worse and worse until you have to spend an entire day just cleaning it and it's the worst experience ever. 

6. **Keep yourself clean.** Shower. Every other day at least. No excuses. Shower.

7. **Don't lounge on your bed.** Your bed is for sleeping only (or sex). Don't doom scroll on tiktok or twitter or whatever on your bed during your down time. Do that literally anywhere else. The moment you start doing other things on your bed is the moment your brain stops associating your bed with just sleep. Those mixed signals make it hard to fall and stay asleep. 

8. **Separate work from fun.** This is similar to the above. Keep wherever you do work as a place to only do work, and keep wherever you do anything else as the places where you do those things. A good option is to do work outside of your dorm room entirely. 

9. **Your health matters most.** This is a big one. If your classes get to be too much for you, **take a day off.** Breaks are vital to our brains, and classes are never ending. It's rough and stressful. Take care of yourselves, please. 



Reminder: You got this. Regardless of your situation, you can do it. Ask for help when you need it, that's what resources are for, and know it'll be okay. It's a brand new start and the first step to doing well is the right attitude. Go crush it. <3",11,1736952021.0,UNCCharlotte,3,0.92,False

I also have mini-UTIs every time I get dehydrated or even look in the direction of polyester/lacy underpants. This fall I had a string of bad UTIs that resulted in a kidney infection with a fever that landed me in a hospital and kidney pain, scared me something aweful.

Thing I have done/do consistently and still get UTIs

* I drink about 2,5 liters of water everyday, that's not including juice, tea, coffee...
* I wear 100% cotton underwear which I wash at 60 or 90 degrees Celsius after each use
* Also wash my sheets, towels, pajamas at 60 or 90 degrees
* Wear loose pants from natural fibers
* Sleep without underwear
* Taken every possible herbal or cranberry or D Mannose supplement on the market
* Wipe front to back after using the bathroom and also wash my nethers in the shower with Protex soap EVERY TIME after no2.
* Harass my partner to be clean and wash hands for sex (same partner for 10 years and he doesnt get UTIs)
* Pee and wash right after sex (again with Protex soap)
* Take a single dose of antibiotics after each intercourse
* had urine culture and ultrasound of kidneys

I'm running out of ideas. I had this clean, sanitized sex like 3 days ago and now it burns when I pee, abdomen hurts, pee is dark and cloudy. And this is despite taking all the care in the world, peeing like a racehorse due to amounts of water consumed, etc. One thing that bothers me is that my pee is cloudy all the time.

____________________

The cold wind whispered through the dense forest as Sarah, Jake, and Emily gathered around the flickering campfire. It was their annual getaway—a weekend of laughter and escape from the pressures of city life. This time, they’d chosen Black Hollow Woods, a place infamous for its eerie stories. But they didn’t care; the thrill was part of the fun.

""I still can't believe you dragged me here,"" Emily muttered, wrapping her arms tightly around herself. ""This place gives me the creeps.""

""Relax,"" Jake said with a smirk. ""It's just a forest. The only thing you'll find here is us, marshmallows, and a good time.""

Sarah poked the fire with a stick, her face unusually serious. ""I read something about these woods,"" she said softly. ""There was a disappearance here, years ago. A group of friends just like us. They were never found.""

Emily's eyes widened. ""You couldn't have mentioned this before we came?""

Jake laughed. ""C'mon, it’s probably just a story to scare people away. Besides, we’ve got each other. Nothing’s going to happen.""

But as the night deepened, unease settled over the group. The woods were too quiet. No crickets, no rustling leaves—just an oppressive silence that seemed to watch them.


---

The First Discovery

The next morning, Sarah woke up early and decided to explore. She followed a narrow path winding deeper into the forest, the crisp air biting at her skin. Just as she was about to turn back, something caught her eye: a small, weathered notebook lying in the dirt.

She picked it up and flipped through its pages. The entries were frantic, scribbled in haste.

""They’re watching us. They know we’re here. We should’ve left when we had the chance.""

Her heart pounded as she turned to the last page.

""If you find this, it’s already too late.""

Sarah stumbled back to the campsite, clutching the notebook. She found Jake and Emily sipping coffee by the fire. “Look at this,” she said, her voice trembling as she handed it over.

Jake read a few lines and frowned. “It’s probably fake. Someone left it here to mess with people.”

Emily wasn’t convinced. “What if it’s real? What if something happened to them?”

“Then why would we find it now, perfectly placed for someone to stumble across?” Jake shot back.

But before the argument could escalate, a scream tore through the woods.


---

A Vanished Friend

They ran toward the sound, their hearts racing. It was coming from the direction of the stream where they'd planned to collect water. But when they arrived, there was no one there—only a red scarf tangled in the branches of a tree.

“Where’s Emily?” Sarah whispered, her voice shaking.

“She was right behind us,” Jake said, turning in circles. “Emily! Emily, this isn’t funny!”

But the woods swallowed their voices, offering no response.


---

The Unraveling

Hours turned into a frantic search. Jake and Sarah scoured every inch of the forest, calling Emily’s name until their throats were raw. As night fell, they returned to the campsite, exhausted and terrified.

“What’s happening?” Sarah asked, her eyes filled with tears. “She wouldn’t just vanish.”

Jake’s face was pale, his bravery gone. “We need to leave. Now.”

But as they packed, Sarah noticed something strange: Emily’s belongings were gone. Her bag, her coat, even her shoes. It was as if she’d never been there.


---

The Stranger

The next morning, they stumbled across a man in the woods. He was dressed in tattered clothes, his face gaunt and weathered. He introduced himself as Thomas, claiming to be a hiker who’d been lost for days.

“Have you seen our friend?” Sarah asked desperately.

Thomas hesitated. “I saw… someone. Last night. Near the old cabin up the hill.”

“There’s a cabin?” Jake asked.

Thomas nodded. “But you shouldn’t go there. Bad things happen in these woods.”

Despite his warning, they decided to follow his lead. The cabin was dilapidated, its windows shattered, and the door hanging off its hinges. Inside, they found symbols scrawled on the walls and a chilling sight: a row of photographs, each one showing a different group of people. In the most recent photo, Sarah, Jake, and Emily were smiling around their campfire.

“What the hell is this?” Jake whispered.

Before anyone could answer, the door slammed shut, and the room plunged into darkness.


---

The Truth Unveiled

When the lights flickered back on, Thomas was gone, and Emily stood in his place. Her face was blank, her eyes devoid of emotion.

“Emily!” Sarah cried, running to her.

But Emily didn’t move. Instead, she spoke in a voice that wasn’t hers—a deep, guttural tone that echoed in the small room.

“You were warned,” she said. “But you didn’t listen.”

The symbols on the walls began to glow, and the air grew heavy. Jake grabbed Sarah’s arm. “We need to get out of here!”

But the cabin seemed alive, its walls closing in around them. Sarah screamed as shadows rose from the floor, their tendrils wrapping around Jake and pulling him into the darkness.

“Run!” he shouted, his voice fading as he disappeared.

Sarah bolted out of the cabin, her heart pounding. She didn’t stop running until she reached the edge of the woods, collapsing in exhaustion. 


---

The Final Entry

Weeks later, the authorities searched Black Hollow Woods but found no trace of Jake, Emily, or Thomas. The only thing they recovered was a weathered notebook lying near the abandoned campsite.

Inside was a new entry, written in shaky handwriting.

""They’re watching us. They know we’re here. We should’ve left when we had the chance.""

Sarah stared at the notebook from her hospital bed, her hands trembling. She knew one thing for certain: Black Hollow Woods didn’t let anyone leave unmarked.

Again, she seemed very down to doing that. I asked her when she would be available. She said she’s usually free on the weekends. I said, okay great would this Saturday work (it was Monday at the time). She responds back later on and says she’s unfortunately busy this weekend. So then I suggest next weekend and then she tells me she’s busy again because of her friend’s birthday. At this point I asked her again when she’d be free and to let me know.

I recently got sick and because I am immunocompromised, and I have MCAS and POTS, it seems to have triggered my gastritis to flare-up. I also have been not great for the past couple of months about drinking coffee and diet soda, but that had been since September, so I’m surprised it only just now started flaring up again. My first flare was July through October of 2023 (diagnosed with chronic duodenitis and gastritis via endoscopy showing high mast cell yield in duodenum and stomach) but it improved despite continuing to drink diet soda back then. So I adding in coffee for a few months (I wasn’t drinking coffee then), then getting a virus really tipped it over. I cut out the coffee 5 days ago and cut out the soda completely as of yesterday. I’m only eating gluten free waffles, yogurt, nature valley bars, and chicken and rice. A few popsicles to soothe my throat. 

I’m wondering how you all get prescribed carafate? The minute I eat I get incredibly bloated and throughout the day I have terrible LPR and stomach pain. I meet with the gastro Monday and I’m hoping they will do another endoscopy. Did you get it prescribed after an endoscopy? Or had you had gastritis for a certain amount of years?

I stayed away from herbals and teas as well so that eliminates yung concern ko doon.

The symptoms appeared too fast as well, so I also considered yung what I took before which is nothing more but coffees lang.

I have the inattentive version of adhd, and everything is just sucking my energy dry. I take Ritalin (mix of long and short lasting), and while I feel that it helps with maintaining focus and not daydream so much - I just am so frustrated because I am always so low on energy.

I register every sensory input (is that the word?) I see, hear or smell around me. Filtering those things out requires so much of my focus, that doing normal things like my job, or remembering in what order to do tasks. Like listening to my manager’s feedback in 1o1 talks is a huge struggle. Afterwards I can’t remember what has been said, and I get critique for not tackling the issues that were mentioned. 

I started overmedicating myself with Ritalin, thinking that I needed higher doses to cope. My doctor recognised that I was on a destructive path, and my husband is momentarily in charge of my meds.

I take vitamins daily, and my blood is checked yearly (had anemia 6 years ago), so I know the fatigue is not because of low blood levels. 

I drink a lot of energy drinks to compensate, as I dislike coffee, but it’s not working. I just can’t process anything anymore. People tell me to nap and sleep, but I’m not tired. It’s also impossible for me to explain in a way that people seem to understand, so I’m hoping someone here will.

1i1yb7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bookkeeping/comments/1i1yb7j/writeoff_misconceptions/,Write-Off Misconceptions.. 👇," 🚨 Not everything is a write-off! 

🚨The phrase “write it off” gets tossed around a lot, but let’s set the record straight. 

Here are common misconceptions about business write-offs and the truths you need to know:

Misconception #1:

""If I pay for it, it’s deductible.""

❌ Truth: Only expenses that are ordinary and necessary for your business operations are deductible. 

Buying a yacht isn’t deductible for a graphic design business, but it might be for a luxury charter company.

Misconception #2:

""I don’t need receipts if it’s a small expense.""

❌ Truth: The IRS loves receipts as much as we love coffee. 🧾 

Keep them for every deduction, no matter how small. Apps like Expensify or QuickBooks can help you track them seamlessly.

Misconception #3:

""Meals and entertainment are fully deductible.""

❌ Truth: Meals are usually 50% deductible, and most entertainment expenses (like concert tickets) are not deductible at all. The exception? If the entertainment is directly tied to business, like hosting a seminar.

Misconception #4:

""Personal expenses can be written off if I use them for business.""

❌ Truth: Mixed-use items (like your car or home office) must be allocated between personal and business use. 

For example, if your home office is 10% of your home, you can deduct 10% of your utilities and rent/mortgage.

Misconception #5:

""All business travel is deductible.""

❌ Truth: Only the portion of travel that’s business-related is deductible. If you mix in personal time, you’ll need to prorate. Always document the business purpose of the trip to stay compliant.

Misconception #6:

""Paying my family members automatically counts as a deductible expense.""

❌ Truth: Payments to family members must be for legitimate work, with documentation and fair market wages. Otherwise, it could be flagged as an attempt to reduce taxable income unfairly.

Misconception #7:

""I can write off unpaid invoices as deductions.""

❌ Truth: Only accrual-basis businesses can deduct bad debts. If you’re on a cash-basis system, you never recorded the revenue, so there’s nothing to deduct.

Misconception #8:

""Paying contractors doesn’t need documentation since they’re not employees.""

❌ Truth: If you pay an independent contractor $600 or more in a year, you’re required to issue them a Form 1099-NEC. 

Always collect a W-9 form before work begins.

Don’t Forget These Write-Offs!!

Here are some less obvious but valid deductions you might be missing: 

✅ Software subscriptions (like Canva or QuickBooks) 

✅ Professional development (courses, certifications, conferences) 

✅ Business insurance premiums 

✅ Marketing expenses

Write-offs are not magical free money, they reduce taxable income, but only if used correctly and backed by proper documentation.

1i1yb1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/1i1yb1z/waterfall_build/,Waterfall Build,"Over the holidays I came across an absolutely amazing build by MsBigFoot at this waterfall and decided I wanted to give the location a try.  I've been wanting to make a tall build with style for quite some time but haven't had one come together yet - each time I tried the build spoke to me and told me it wasn't right for that location!

When I started the build I realized how vertical the cliff was and that this was the spot to make my tall build!  I didn't want to make the base in the lake and build upward, rather I wanted the appearance that it was built  into the cliff face with the usable/livable part of the build on the surface.  At the same time I discovered there was a small cave under the waterfall so I had to find a way to bring that into the build.

To facilitate this took a few attempts to get the camp area in the right spot and I ended up placing it on the ledge about 1 character height below the waterfalls outlet.  This gave me enough access to the shallow water I could get foundations out to start my build right at the water level (who knew walls couldn't be placed in water?!?)

I really wanted to build sides to the 'tower' that closed the gap with the cliff but I couldn't get that to work and still have the glass as close to the waterfall as I wanted it... so I decided to live with gaps visible directly from the sides... 

I really like to make all my camps functional - which means finding a place in them for all the workbenches - and after deciding to expand the bottom floor out over the waterfall I realized I'd have enough room to use the entire upstairs for that purpose.  It's crowded but functional and I didn't have to merge any workbenches to make this happen.

I really like having Yasmine as my companion, every time I server hop I buy her stock of carnivore buffs and this keeps my freezer ready for double xp and double score weekends.  At the same time I hate that her stove is so awkward... the fact that the 'modern kitchen' bundle doesn't come with a functional cook top absolutely blows but captures how Bethesda keeps knocking it out of the park with their new content... just outside the foul ball line.

I do plan on adding a lot of clutter/junk/misc items here and there but I don't have the chessboard in my account, so I get to wait until a friend is on that can throw down the 30 displays I want and then I can get back on the merge-wagon.

As it sits this camp is just shy of max budget but has room for the displays and I don't really want to put anything else in it.
