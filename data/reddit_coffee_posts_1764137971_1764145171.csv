like before, food just appears at home. now? if u don’t cook, u don’t eat. and as a med student, most days are just hospital, class, aral, pagod, then sleep. by the time i get back, wala na talaga energy to cook anything legit. so ayun, instant noodles, bread, coffee… girl dinner 🥲

but it’s not even just the food that i miss

i miss someone asking “kumain ka na?”
i miss eating w my family
i miss going home to noise instead of dead silence

people say living alone makes u strong and independent. true naman. but it also makes u realize how heavy quiet can be.

sometimes i just sit there eating my not-so-meal, thinking about home and how easy life felt when u didn’t have to do everything yourself. when someone just… took care of u.

don’t get me wrong, grateful ako for this life and for chasing my dream. but some nights, i’d trade the freedom for one lutong-bahay meal and a familiar voice.

anyone else feeling this or am i just being emo rn 🥲",1,1764144648.0,SoloLivingPH,3,0.67,False

**Profile:** 9/7/8 GNEM Fresher

**CAT:** 96.53 %ile

**Specialization:** Marketing **Slot:** 9:45am, 5th Feb 2025

ID verified by 9:45

A case study at 10:10am was given the sheets for 20 minutes. The case study was about living with your parents as a mid-20s working individual, pros and cons.

G1 started at 11am

**Panel:** P1 (Older guy, extremely lovely) and P2 (Younger guy, had a strong presence)

Candidates: F (Marketing specialization, BCom graduate, family business)

M1 (me)

M2 (Finance + BM specialization, BCom graduate, 30m workex in insurance)

M3 (Finance specialization, BCom graduation, fresher)

The interview started with banter, the panelists asking us to be human and let go of tense behaviour indoctrinated by coaching institutes

Asked us what they should ask to put us at ease, F replied hobbies, and I agreed, while the rest didn't reply. P2 joked that only F and M1 had hobbies, and the other two didn't because they didn't say anything. So yeah, that paints the picture for the whole interview. Very chill and casual.

Another thing adding to the friendly banter is that, due to pure happenstance, M3 got rejected in G1 last year by the same panelist (P1), which he thought was his fault because he couldn't answer some finance question last time, and so the panelist joked that seeing him must've ruined M3's day (it probably did lmao)

**Actual questions:**

TMAY, but not in your form

F: Talked a bunch about things already in her form

M1: Talked about my passion for things and love of working with people

M2: Talked about things in this form

M3: Talked about his interests, but also things in his form

I think they should've taken the liberty to talk about things not in the form more.

Actual questions started with F, who was asked about how a company would go about measuring brand awareness.

She initially struggled to get to the point of the question, but the panelist helped her find her flow, and eventually she answered well.

Then P2 asked me about how biology would influence consumer behaviour (he initially assumed I had biology in undergrad, but I didn't, so he told me to answer what knowledge I had).

Initially, I answered with generic ideas, but he encouraged and guided me in the direction of talking specifics (particular brain parts, pathways, hormones), and I answered well.

M2 was asked about his job profile, what he does, the tools he uses, and some generic questions about implications of his insurance work, which I think he fumbled a little in answering

M3 was asked to give his views on the questions, and he didn't add that much new info, so the panelists were generally a little dissatisfied

M3 was asked some specific finance things that I have absolutely no idea about (pardon me for financial illiteracy).

Questions moved back to me, I was asked how a coping mechanism could be used in marketing, I gave some examples of guerrilla marketing and talked about creating association of peace and serenity through meditation booth in a showroom (not quite happy with it, and I think the P2 wasn't quite happy either).

F offered to add marketing tactics of Zomato, which notify you things like ""if you're lonely, why not have a sandwich?"" etc, which I think was a smart answer, and the panelists shared my feelings.

M2 was asked about his hobby of cricket, but he didn't quite answer very well (they were technical things).

F was asked about her hobbies, and P1 asked what dystopian books she read (she mentioned she was interested). She also mentioned Asura and how Ravan's perspective was presented.

The discussion grew to the whole panel with P1 talking about how anything contrary gains popularity with the new generation. We were asked to give our views on the matter. I said it was more of a matter of perceptions (how people perceive contrarian views as inherently informed, even if it isn't true), and others were asked if they agreed.

P1 remarked he would only be convinced with Asura if Ravan himself was there telling his story, to which M3 rebutted that Ram didn't write Ramayan either, which we all agreed with and laughed. I commend his wit on that one.

Then we were led to the waiting room with snacks and coffee. I'm writing this while waiting for the results.

G1 lasted for 50 mins give or take.

Verdict: The Entire group selected for G2 (After 50 mins of waiting)

It was more waiting for G2 to start, but the adcom member guiding us around was nice, and we talked for 15-20mins about the interviews, life at SPJIMR, and such, which was fun.

G2: New panel, P1 late 40s P2 mid 40s, both women, had a strong presence.

My group was F (Finance, Fresher), M1 (me), M2 (Marketing, work experience in Career Launcher)

First question: You're in an elevator with Bill Gates, you have 30 seconds to introduce yourself and tell him why you admire him

I fumbled a bit here and didn't introduce myself, mostly talked about what I like about him.

F took it in the direction of Mahakumbh (was Bill Gates in India for Mahakumbh? Idfk), so we discussed the stampede for a little bit.

M2 gave an example of a Coldplay concert, so the discussion went there. Asked about what the hot news is about Coldplay (Panelists were looking for something specific, none of us had any clue about it)

P1 asked me about my favourite new psychologist, and I didn't remember his name, but I talked about the guy behind social constructivism and the postmodernist movement. They wanted to know far more details about social constructivism, so I went on a monologue for like 5-6mins. Not sure what they thought of it.

Then we were asked our key takeaway from the case study and our stance. That's it.",1,1764144334.0,CATiim,0,1.0,False

I have it for 2 months and I cannot find a way to make coffee taste like coffee and be palatable. The resulting liquid doesn't taste bitter or sour but has some strange chemical taste slightly metalic and less like coffee. I have been experimenting and managed to make both bitter and sour espresso so I think my technique is correct for this type of machine as result is neither. However it is the worst coffee I had in my life. I get better result from vending machine coffee.

I only drink coffee black for the past 15 years, maybe sometimes I use plant based milk. Espresso in cafes always tastes so nice but maybe not very creamy. I thought I could get similar or better result at home but so far I have a problem with the taste. I have used two store-bought ground coffee brands that I have used before with my Bialetti and for cold brew coffee so those taste fine when used for other ways of brewing. 

Lavazza Crema e gusto classico makes what could best be desribed as tea from ground coffee. Has zero kick but foam is very creamy and thick. Doesn't wake me up. Water with a taste of coffee. ( on the image of this post )

  
Julius Meinl Vienna espresso buonaroma at least gives some kind of kick but less than instant coffee. Foam is very thick with big bubbles that persist even the day after. Tastes more like coffee than Lavazza but foam is pure soap that has to be physically removed as it will not make room for sugar to be added.

I only use filtered water. I have been brewing daily hoping that I will magically manage to make coffee taste good. So far my technique is to add coffee with a spoon that came with machine up to the max bar, press once, wait for water to reach 90°C. Add sugar and instant coffee ( for kick ) in the cup and make 2-3 shots each 5-7 seconds long until my cup is full. Result is at least drinkable and I can manage through soapy foam. I don't understand how people use this at home and get good coffee. What am I doing wrong?

Food is very good, nice flavour & quality, fresh and not oily.

Dishes we've tried were all very good:
* Char Kuey Tow -- good wok hei
* Chicken curry & roti -- tasty
* Chicken & salt fish fried rice -- light & flavoursome
* Chicken Laksa -- great flavour, lemongrass notes

Price about $18-22 for lunch dishes. Good portions.

But the extra bonus is that KL do coffee & great cakes! They have a cabinet of crepe cakes layered with pancakes, whipped cream & fruit. Amazingly fresh, light & tasty.

We've tried:
* Mango crepe cake -- fresh mango, it's great!
* Taro crepe cake -- very nice
* Tiramisu crepe cake -- nice, rich but not too sweet
* Cheesecakes -- haven't tried but other customer tells us good.

Prices about $11 a slice.

These crepe cakes are light and delicious -- they absolutely beat the pants off the traditional gateaux style cakes (Bluebells/ Valery/ Gateaux House). For me definitely a contender for best cakes in Auckland!

Location in Kelston shops is a little unexpected, but this is quite a hidden gem -- definitely worth traveling, and the crepe cakes are a must try.",8,1764144021.0,aucklandeats,1,1.0,False

1p723dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/1p723dq/had_a_possible_encounter_with_a_cult_a_few_months/,Had a possible encounter with a cult a few months ago and it won’t stop bothering me. Can you help?,"I (28M) am going to try and keep it as short as possible. A couple of months ago i went to party/techno gig in a warehouse downtown eastside (yes, the one you’re thinking of). 

My friends left around 5AM but I wanted to stay a bit longer (went on till 6AM). While I was drunk I was still in my senses. After the party ended, I went out and was chatting with the doorman and a couple other guys outside when suddenly the doorman said “I’d suggest you leave if you know what I mean, the longer you stay the more you’ll learn, and I’m guessing you won’t like it”. This triggered a bad vibe and I felt like I should leave immediately. I walked away without a word, simply trusting my gut. It was bright daylight so I thought I’d take transit home since it would save me some money. 

After I crossed the alley, I noticed two dudes from the party (ones standing outside but were not talking to me) were following me. I didn’t think anything of it and thought they were going home too. It got weirder when a few more showed up (I recognised them from the party) and were following me. I took a longer route around the block to arrive back where I was walking (to see if I was paranoid or it was actually happening). And voila, those same dudes were sitting with the homeless folks. They stuck out like sore thumbs so I could easily tell them apart, this got me thinking if they’re actually trying to mug me or something because I was alone. I walked a bit further and thankfully saw a VPD posted on E hastings (as they always are). When I looked back I didn’t see anyone so I thought they gave up. 

A couple of minutes later I see them again, this time they were slightly further back. I quickly got on the bus and just went anywhere (not my house) in case they were weirdos or something. They didn’t pursue me further but a few stops later I saw one of them board the bus and sit in a seat from where he could clearly see me. This was quite odd and freaked me out tbh. I kept going and went to the last stop (which stopped about 30KM from my place). There’s a Tim’s there so I thought I’d get something to eat before I take the train. When I went in it was completely empty and I ordered some food to dine in. While I was eating I realised I had to pee (drunk piss) so I got up and went to the washroom. 

This store has a wall in the middle tall enough to obscure vision towards the other side. The washroom was on the other side so I walked around it and to my surprise ; the doorman I was chatting with was sitting there (no food or coffee) and had his head layed down on the table. I stared at him while walking and decided to quiet down my footsteps. I actually stopped to see if it was actually him and he peeked at me twice and quickly put his head down again (fishy). I decided to sit down on that very table and said “hey man good to see you again, what brings you here?”. He stared at me like he saw a ghost and said nothing. I offered him coffee, nothing. I smiled for a couple of seconds and then asked “you seem to be wasting a lot of resources to follow me, don’t worry I’m not that important”. His ears perked up and he said “long night?”. This kinda ticked me and I said “your guys suck at acting like crackheads, I could clearly tell them apart”. To this statement he finally reacted with a smile and said “yeah?”. He then walked outside the store. I then saw him through the glass panel, he was talking to the same dude from outside the party (middle aged white guy). Suddenly the whole store filled up with people (some of those were the guys I recognised; this was like 8AM). Very odd indeed. 

Then I saw a crackhead-like dude who kept smiling at me. I invited him to join me at the table and bought him a coffee. I asked “you do your part well, you must be experienced” to which he replies “this is me”. 

I’ll spare you the details but I had a smoke with him outside and asked him “be real with me what’s up”. He says “you might be a duplicate”. And I was like wtf. “You mean like a clone or something”? (I was cross faded af making up theories in my head). He goes “you must think I’m crazy”. 

Soon after, I left in the next bus and this dude gets on with me. I got off a couple of stops later and waved goodbye to him. I’ve been to this venue a couple of times before and after and never seen/saw this group of people again. 

I have a couple of theories that I thought could fit in here since Vancouver has some weird shit going on (especially underground). 

1. They’re undercover cops/feds who mistook me for a drug dealer or criminal they were looking for. 

2. They’re an actual cult (think raelian) that had weird cloning shit going on lol. 

3. They’re criminals themselves preying on solo partygoers to rob them. 

4. Someone had PI put on me for some reason (least likely) 

Context : I’m a pretty chill guy who parties every now and then. I never did anyone wrong or did anything illegal (weed is legal where I’m from) 

Sure I had a few arguments with people I know around town but nothing too crazy. I sure don’t have any opps lmao. 

What do you guys think of this? I can give more detail if need be. 

P.S I don’t think I’m in danger anymore since I never saw them again and it’s been a few months already. I’m just curious if anyone had any similar experiences or heard any stories like this? ",2,1764143986.0,cults,0,0.75,False
1p722g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1p722g6/id_like_to_introduce_myself/,I'd like to introduce myself.,"I (60f) am one of the oldest here, but feel I may have some thoughts that resonate with some of you. 

My father was severely bipolar but was also a raging misogynist. I was unable to have anyone over to our house as a child due to his unpredictable behaviour. It also set up the people pleaser in me because you believe as a child that if you just behave properly then you will get treated better. I walked on eggshells for years and so did my brothers. As I got older, I realised that nothing I did would please him and I gave up trying. He used to leave the family for months at a time abd these were the only times I felt safe.

I never learned the basic skills of making friends, so when I started at an all girls high school, I did not make a single friend. I tried really hard too. Eventually I resigned myself to the fact that I would be spending every lunch time in the school library as it hid the fact that I literally had no one and nowhere to go. I developed anorexia as a 15 year old and not one teacher asked if I was OK. My family thought it was a ""phase"", so I was dealing with starvation physically and emotionally. I was anorexic for 2 years!

The friendless life continued right throughout my adulthood. I married at 21 to a man who was initially a terrible husband, but actually matured into a decent guy who genuinely loves me and we are going on 39 years married and he treats me well and considers me his best friend. I should not have persevered in my marriage based on what I witnessed in my parent's marriage, but people can change and my husband certainly did.

In my 40's, I used my childhood education qualification to become an agency nanny. I had to go into strangers houses and make them comfortable with me immediately. I was a popular nanny because I was great with kids and parents genuinely liked me. I say this as a way of letting you know that my personality doesn't seem to be the issue with my friendless life. I did this job for 10 years and enjoyed the honesty of the children in my care. 

During covid I changed careers to Medical Admin. I was in my mid 50's and the bullying was unbelievable. In fact, the level of bullying I experienced is actually illegal in Australia, but I took control of it by ignoring it. Two women who witnessed my treatment at that clinic took me under their wing and to my absolute surprise became close friends. Only 1 of us still works there, but we meet regularly for coffee and message each other constantly. So I made 2 friends that I love dearly.

I also adopt senior rescue dogs and have acquaintances in this area. 

All of my life, I have kept up my fitness by walking everyday. I am used to my own company, so I have always done activities on my own rather than miss out. My husband worked shifts, so I had a lot of time to myself. We have one child (32m) and I made sure he had as much social interactions as possible. He is happily living with his fiance (31m) 

I have 3 brothers who live quite a distance from me. Our get togethers are infrequent but pleasant in an aloof kind of way. We all had such tumultuous childhoods that family connectiveness never really happened. Our father used to leave us for months at a time as children and teenagers. Our mother went into survival mode. She is now 91 and lives a really active peaceful life without my father who died 10 years ago. I don't hate him, but I don't miss him. He treated mum like shit and she worked full time and doted on him when we were young.

I’ve been troubleshooting some inconsistencies with the Morning Mini and wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this. My original issue was that when starting the machine from cold, I’d sometimes get 7–10g of water discharged during pre-infusion before the shot even began. Support had me run the calibration cycle 2–3 times to stabilize the pump, and after doing that, the next several brews were completely clean — zero discharge during pre-infusion and the bloom looked normal. Later on, when I brewed again, there was still no discharge at all, but the coffee itself came out more as a trickle. However, the correct output weight still came out and the shot tasted fine. When I tried a different capsule afterward, the flow was totally normal again. So now I’m leaning toward that one capsule being the culprit rather than the machine. Still curious, though — has anyone else seen cold-start pre-infusion discharge that disappears after calibration, or capsule-specific flow issues like this?",1,1764143857.0,MorningCoffeeMachine,0,1.0,False

Hey I’m Denise! I’m a pretty easy going and extroverted gal. I struggle to sit still and have a lot of different interests. I hate to disappoint but I’m not a gamer lol.I just happen to like the Discord app and communities. I love to travel and  explore new spots around town, especially coffee shops. I enjoy dancing, trying new restaurants,and watching sports in my free time. Recently started getting back into reading and would love some recommendations, especially for mystery, sci-fi or historical fiction! Looking to connect with kind goal oriented and thoughtful people.

# As Lola Hudson meticulously inscribed her name on the confidential exit agreement, the staff seated across the polished table leaned forward, their expressions tinged with concern.

“Mrs. Hudson, are you completely certain about your decision to embark on this overseas peacekeeping mission? Our records indicate that you have a husband and a child. Please understand, once you depart, your absence will be classified, and you will not be able to reach out to your family again.”

For a fleeting moment, Lola’s pen hesitated, hovering above the paper as if weighing the gravity of her choice. Yet, with a resolve that surprised even herself, she completed the signature with a steady hand, her heart pounding in her chest.

“I’m sure. As for my family…” A sharp bitterness cut through her words, her smile faltering, morphing into something colder, more brittle. “They’ll be nothing but supportive.”

The staff member nodded, a hint of understanding in their eyes, as they slid a blank plane ticket across the table. The only detail it bore was the departure time and location, a stark reminder of the journey ahead.

“Then please ensure you arrive at the airport on time. We wish you all the best in your endeavors.”

Stepping out of the office building, Lola was met with the relentless downpour that mirrored the tumult within her. She unfurled her umbrella, seeking shelter from the rain, but the fabric of her clothes was already damp, clinging uncomfortably to her skin.

“In weather like this, heading out is pure misery,” the driver remarked, his voice laced with a hint of sympathy.

Lola merely nodded in agreement, her gaze drifting to the gray curtain of rain that obscured her view. Memories flooded her mind, pulling her back to just a few days prior when she had braved a tempest far fiercer than this, her feverish body battling the elements to deliver stomach medicine to Charlie Hudson.

On that day, she had cradled a container of clam chowder and the medicine tightly against her chest, determined to keep them dry, as if they were the last vestiges of her resolve. But upon her arrival, she had found herself the unwitting participant in a cruel mockery.

Laughter echoed through the room, sharp and mocking. Someone had confessed to losing a bet, never believing anyone would venture out in such weather for a mere twenty-minute delivery. In that moment, Lola felt the heat of humiliation wash over her, her cheeks burning as if she had been slapped across the face.

Disoriented and filled with an overwhelming sense of betrayal, she turned to Charlie for solace. But his gaze was fixed entirely on the woman sitting beside him—Rose Pearson.

Lola had seen Rose before, her image gracing Charlie’s desk, his phone’s screensaver, and framed photographs in his office. Yet, she had never anticipated their first encounter would unfold in such a humiliating manner. Rose lounged comfortably next to Charlie, draped in his jacket, while Lola stood there, drenched and shivering, water streaming down her hair like a waterfall.

With a polite smile, Rose extended a handful of tissues toward her. “Is this your maid? Braving such heavy rain to make a delivery? Charlie, you’d better remember to give her a raise when you get home.”

Lola’s mind went blank, a swirl of emotions crashing within her. But before she could fully process the insult, her body reacted instinctively, smacking the tissues from Rose’s hand.

The sound was soft, a mere whisper of paper against air, yet it silenced the entire private room in an instant.

Before she could regain her composure, a forceful shove sent her sprawling to the ground. Her head collided with the sharp edge of a glass coffee table, and darkness enveloped her.

When she finally regained consciousness, she found herself in a hospital bed, her head swathed in thick bandages.

The bed beside her lay empty, a stark reminder of her isolation. Charlie was nowhere to be found. Neither was her son, Edwin. Despite having a family, she lay alone in that sterile ward, the silence echoing in her ears like a haunting melody.

As she turned on her phone, her heart sank at the sight of the screen. The only messages waiting for her were spam texts from her service provider. Not a single word of concern or care from anyone she loved.

A tightness gripped her chest, and her eyes stung with unshed tears. She fought against the rising tide of despair and dialed Edwin’s number. She had already given up on Charlie’s affection, but the longing to see her son—her precious child whom she had carried for nine long months—was a desperate need that overwhelmed her.",1,1764143548.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False
1p71ydx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1p71ydx/my_venture_into_removing_social_media_and/,My venture into removing social media and dopamine bait. (Story),"To outline me, I'm an undergrad geology student at a university in the UK, 20M. I have this Cotswolds (A hilly and moderately geologically significant countryside region) trip coming up in the Spring/Summer 2025. The night before I go on this trip, a freak accident occurs in the gym where a shoddily re-racked weight slips off the rack and manages to perfectly land on my phone, not cracking it, but completely disabling the screen to where it's unusable.

Here's me panicking that I have no alarm, no communication, completely cut off from the outside world (barring my PC). I get a poor night's sleep due to panic over communication and being on time for the early morning bus.

Nevertheless, I manage to get there on time, get on the bus for 2-3 hours using my laptop to listen to music I pre-downloaded (I love music I'll never cut it out). I arrive at this trip and everything is just absolutely perfect. The weather, contrary to usual sentiment, is blaringly sunny, gorgeous with a kind gentle warmth, the accommodation, while being small and bunk beds, had excellent service, catered food; delicious and filling. Had a bar with my favourite beer, kind staff, good music.

During this trip the workload was very light, and we had some light hearted visits to our lecturer's family who lived there. The views were stunning the walks were, while tough and mostly involving hills were engaging, had some good geology and a well wrapped story.

Yet something I noticed - my peers were particularly groany and some even wanted to return home, while my happiness level was so consistently high and positive I was shocked from this. Now correlation isn't causation but my friend, as he was hooked up on his phone dealing with some orchestra drama of some sort (shocker), did actually return home early, even after me trying to convince him to stay on the trip. This made me realise the intensity of the pressure that a simple portable device can put on someone. I was disconnected from the outside world, so I could actually be there, present, with my head actually in this beautiful countryside.

I soon realised the factor that I needed to eliminate, my phone (well it was already pre-eliminated by bad luck, or good luck, in my view.)  
Perhaps it was an act of God idk, but it made me realise that I needed to achieve far less dependence on my phone.

From the financial standpoint, when I took it into repair, as I didn't have insurance, I was looking at £500 to repair it (cause you know apple). Fortunately in terms of money, as the screen wasn't cracked and it was still in warranty (6 days before expiration), the technician managed to convince apple to cover it as a fault so I got the repair for completely free (the goat).

However, this whole trip made me take steps to reduce my phone usage. I installed opal which was popular at the time to reduce my screen time, I hit 2,000 hours saved, but then I'd have 2-3 days where I'd delve into degeneracy and completely disable all the blockers and just rot in my bed. At the same time I read that the apps and phone track your phone scroll speed to determine your mood and recommend mood-based content, often amplifying a bad mood into a level of depression, and I was eating it up like a ribeye steak. I realised I had to do something, so I deleted those apps (mainly instagram), but over the past 2 months I just kept using the web versions and betraying myself. So a couple weeks ago I decided to completely delete my instagram account, with no regrets, and get the numbers of people I actually care to talk to. No more reels being sent with absolute bilge, no more crappy memes and brainrot. ""Did you see the reel I sent you?"" ""NO"". It gave me a snotty level of satisfaction I suppose but we aren't perfect empaths.

I found myself getting up in the morning and getting a load of work done, enjoying the little things like making tea and coffee, cooking up big and fancy breakfasts like eggs benedict, improving my room hygeine, sorting out the daily tasks, all with a smile on my face. It is truly liberating. On the youtube side, I disabled all recommendations, so I only watch content I have subscribed to, and unsubscribed from bilgey channels. There's still some work to do, I still have a gaming addiction that I need to mitigate, although it is the mainline communication format with my friends, and my brother back in my home town so I am challenged by that.

I'm replacing my gaming keyboard with a productivity keyboard and trying to make my room as spartan as possible, to basically enable success as I am incredibly ambitious (inspired by my parents) and it's torturous for my life to be hijacked by my phone and social media.

Overall result - Changed my life!

It's all looking up from here, it can be a bit boring, and I do want to pick up some other hobbies like guitar (my original hobby is video editing hence the social media trap and the comparison spiral), I am swarmed with work, but now is possibly the greatest time for me to declutter my brain and boss up on my work and achieve the best I can.

I appreciate I managed to change writing tense in my story but that's mostly due to said story being a brain dump that I'm writing quickly before cracking on with my dissertation.",2,1764143455.0,nosurf,1,1.0,False

It was the strangest passing for me - I was just thinking of you. A few seconds later there you were. I suddenly understood the meaning of the phrase 'stop and stare.' Wow, I don't believe in superstition but that really did feel like something out of a movie?!  Divine intervention - quantum entanglement or something like it.

I'm sorry for not having reached out - I forgot to get your number last time. I also haven't been sure what to tell you. I haven't actually improved that much and I'd hate to give you false hope. 

Yet I want to apologize for not trusting you - I just don't want to get rejected by you. I admire you (like alot).

You know... I often felt completely overwhelmed like I couldn't catch my breath around you. Maybe you reflected something in me that I hadn't quite integrated or loved. You often felt like a mirror, although I was never sure whether that was an intentional strategy, my hypervigilence or coincidence.

It was brutally hard to see you assume the worst of me as well. I felt like I had to hide away and retreat. You reminded me of my caregivers growing up who often threatened and shamed me. I would apologize simply for existing until the age of 23 when I met my someone who showed me a different reality.

However, I can see your intention to grow and connect further despite it being unnatural to you. This gives me hope.

I see us being very close in the future and I have no idea why. It feels like a premonition of sorts even though I don't believe in that sort of thing. It's just you feel so familiar you know?

Regardless, would you like a life update sometime?

I'm open to getting a coffee with you and letting you in even though I'm absolutely terrified of being around you. I trust myself to know how to deal if I get hurt. I'm a big girl now. It's okay.",1,1764143369.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1p71wg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Neither_Zucchini775/comments/1p71wg9/how_accelerator_office_cleaning_improves/,How Accelerator Office Cleaning Improves Productivity in Sydney’s Start-ups and Co-Working Spaces,"**The Start-up Surge in Sydney and the Cleanliness Imperative**

Sydney's start-up scene is exploding, with hubs like Fishburners in The Rocks and Stone & Chalk in the CBD fuelling innovation among over 5,000 new ventures annually. But in these fast-paced co-working spaces, where freelancers, tech teams, and entrepreneurs hot-desk side-by-side, chaos can creep in—spilled coffees, dusty keyboards, and germ-laden meeting rooms. Enter accelerator office cleaning: a high-speed, tailored approach to commercial office cleaning Sydney that doesn't just tidy up but turbocharges productivity. Drawing from top-ranking guides like those from Clean Group and Eastern Suburbs Cleaning, this isn't fluff—studies show clean workspaces boost output by up to 15%, per University of Arizona research cited in SERP leaders. Imagine your team brainstorming without the distraction of cluttered communal lounges; that's the edge accelerator cleaning provides.

**Decoding Accelerator Office Cleaning for Busy Sydney Innovators**

What sets accelerator office cleaning apart in Sydney's co-working world? It's not your standard end-of-lease scrub—it's a nimble, on-demand service optimized for agile environments like WeWork Sydney or Hub Australia in Pyrmont. Semantically, it's about start-up workspace hygiene that aligns with hypernyms like facility management services, ensuring quick-turnaround deep cleans between pitch sessions or funding rounds. Top SERP articles emphasize customization: for a 50-desk space in Surry Hills, this means nightly high-touch surface wiping and morning floor mat shaking to combat the city's harbour dust. The result? A seamless holonym of integrated office ecosystem maintenance that keeps your space humming without halting operations.

**Foot Traffic Frenzy: Why Co-Working Demands Accelerated Hygiene**

Co-working spaces in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs or Inner West see 20-50% higher foot traffic than traditional offices, turning shared desks into germ hotspots. Accelerator cleaning tackles this with lexical terms like commercial sanitation routines, deploying bonded teams for twice-daily hot-desk vacuuming and kitchen sanitization—hyponyms that prevent the 30% absenteeism spike from poor air quality, as noted in Ryak Cleaning's best practices. In a place like Entry 29 in Ultimo, where startups rotate weekly, this proactive approach reduces downtime, letting founders focus on scaling rather than scrubbing. It's incremental: start with weekly audits, then accelerate to daily for peak seasons like Vivid Sydney.

**Health Halo: Cutting Sick Days in Sydney's Shared Workspaces**

Nothing derails a start-up sprint like flu season in the Harbour City. Accelerator office cleaning shines here, incorporating meronyms such as air vent filtration and keyboard sanitizing to slash bacteria by 90%, aligning with NSW Health guidelines for workplace wellness infrastructure. Ranking content from Busy Bee highlights how EPA-approved disinfectants in co-working bathrooms and lounges cut illness by 30%, boosting attendance in hybrid teams at spaces like The Commons in Mascot. For Sydney's pollen-heavy springs, add HEPA vacuums to your regimen—it's not just cleaning; it's a shield for your team's cognitive edge, reducing stress and fostering sharper decision-making.

**Focus Factor: How a Spotless Setup Sharpens Startup Creativity**

Clutter kills concentration—Harvard studies in top SERP pieces like Clean Group's analysis show disorganized spaces hike stress by 20%, tanking idea flow in brainstorming huddles. Accelerator cleaning counters this with eco-friendly corporate tidying, using non-toxic agents for ergonomic chair steam cleaning and boardroom wiping that leaves no residue. In Sydney's tech enclaves like White Rabbit Hall in Chippendale, this means post-pitch deep cleans that reset the vibe, encouraging innovative thinking. Semantically, it's productivity-boosting facility maintenance at work: a tidy lounge invites collaboration, turning passive scrollers into active collaborators.

**Morale Multiplier: Elevating Team Spirit in Co-Working Hubs**

A gleaming workspace signals care—94% of workers feel more motivated in clean offices, per Staples research echoed in Perfection Professionals' guides. For Sydney startups in co-working like Atlassian-backed spaces in Sydney Olympic Park, accelerator cleaning builds this through waste bin rotation and communal lounge dusting, fostering a sense of ownership. It's the holonym of a comprehensive startup workspace regimen: when your team arrives to polished surfaces and fresh air, morale soars, retention climbs 15%, and that elusive ""flow state"" becomes the norm. No more mid-day slumps from dusty vents—just energized hustlers chasing the next unicorn.

**Eco-Edge: Sustainable Speeds for Green-Minded Sydney Ventures**

Sydney's startups aren't just fast—they're forward-thinking, with 64% prioritizing green practices, as per trends in Bestway Cleaning's SERP insights. Accelerator office cleaning accelerates this with biodegradable products for Sydney office deep cleans, minimizing water use in high-rise hubs like Barangaroo. Hyponyms like startup boardroom wiping now use low-VOC solutions, supporting Green Star certifications while cutting allergens—vital for the city's humid summers. This isn't add-on; it's core to agile cleaning for hybrid teams, proving sustainability boosts productivity without slowing your stride.

**Tech-Infused Tactics: Modern Tools for Accelerated Efficiency**

Gone are the days of basic mops—accelerator cleaning leverages UV-C robots for overnight disinfection and app-scheduled audits, as highlighted in OpenWorks' productivity playbook. In co-working like Launchpad in Redfern, this means real-time tracking of high-traffic zones, ensuring executive suite polishing happens pre-dawn. Lexical innovations like Sydney workplace scrubbing with electrostatic sprayers cover 2x the area faster, freeing your ops lead from hygiene headaches.

# As Lola Hudson meticulously inscribed her name on the confidential exit agreement, the staff seated across the polished table leaned forward, their expressions tinged with concern.

“Mrs. Hudson, are you completely certain about your decision to embark on this overseas peacekeeping mission? Our records indicate that you have a husband and a child. Please understand, once you depart, your absence will be classified, and you will not be able to reach out to your family again.”

For a fleeting moment, Lola’s pen hesitated, hovering above the paper as if weighing the gravity of her choice. Yet, with a resolve that surprised even herself, she completed the signature with a steady hand, her heart pounding in her chest.

“I’m sure. As for my family…” A sharp bitterness cut through her words, her smile faltering, morphing into something colder, more brittle. “They’ll be nothing but supportive.”

The staff member nodded, a hint of understanding in their eyes, as they slid a blank plane ticket across the table. The only detail it bore was the departure time and location, a stark reminder of the journey ahead.

“Then please ensure you arrive at the airport on time. We wish you all the best in your endeavors.”

Stepping out of the office building, Lola was met with the relentless downpour that mirrored the tumult within her. She unfurled her umbrella, seeking shelter from the rain, but the fabric of her clothes was already damp, clinging uncomfortably to her skin.

“In weather like this, heading out is pure misery,” the driver remarked, his voice laced with a hint of sympathy.

Lola merely nodded in agreement, her gaze drifting to the gray curtain of rain that obscured her view. Memories flooded her mind, pulling her back to just a few days prior when she had braved a tempest far fiercer than this, her feverish body battling the elements to deliver stomach medicine to Charlie Hudson.

On that day, she had cradled a container of clam chowder and the medicine tightly against her chest, determined to keep them dry, as if they were the last vestiges of her resolve. But upon her arrival, she had found herself the unwitting participant in a cruel mockery.

Laughter echoed through the room, sharp and mocking. Someone had confessed to losing a bet, never believing anyone would venture out in such weather for a mere twenty-minute delivery. In that moment, Lola felt the heat of humiliation wash over her, her cheeks burning as if she had been slapped across the face.

Disoriented and filled with an overwhelming sense of betrayal, she turned to Charlie for solace. But his gaze was fixed entirely on the woman sitting beside him—Rose Pearson.

Lola had seen Rose before, her image gracing Charlie’s desk, his phone’s screensaver, and framed photographs in his office. Yet, she had never anticipated their first encounter would unfold in such a humiliating manner. Rose lounged comfortably next to Charlie, draped in his jacket, while Lola stood there, drenched and shivering, water streaming down her hair like a waterfall.

With a polite smile, Rose extended a handful of tissues toward her. “Is this your maid? Braving such heavy rain to make a delivery? Charlie, you’d better remember to give her a raise when you get home.”

Lola’s mind went blank, a swirl of emotions crashing within her. But before she could fully process the insult, her body reacted instinctively, smacking the tissues from Rose’s hand.

The sound was soft, a mere whisper of paper against air, yet it silenced the entire private room in an instant.

Before she could regain her composure, a forceful shove sent her sprawling to the ground. Her head collided with the sharp edge of a glass coffee table, and darkness enveloped her.

When she finally regained consciousness, she found herself in a hospital bed, her head swathed in thick bandages.

The bed beside her lay empty, a stark reminder of her isolation. Charlie was nowhere to be found. Neither was her son, Edwin. Despite having a family, she lay alone in that sterile ward, the silence echoing in her ears like a haunting melody.

As she turned on her phone, her heart sank at the sight of the screen. The only messages waiting for her were spam texts from her service provider. Not a single word of concern or care from anyone she loved.

A tightness gripped her chest, and her eyes stung with unshed tears. She fought against the rising tide of despair and dialed Edwin’s number. She had already given up on Charlie’s affection, but the longing to see her son—her precious child whom she had carried for nine long months—was a desperate need that overwhelmed her.",1,1764142565.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

The staff member nodded, a hint of understanding in their eyes, as they slid a blank plane ticket across the table. The only detail it bore was the departure time and location, a stark reminder of the journey ahead.

“Then please ensure you arrive at the airport on time. We wish you all the best in your endeavors.”

Stepping out of the office building, Lola was met with the relentless downpour that mirrored the tumult within her. She unfurled her umbrella, seeking shelter from the rain, but the fabric of her clothes was already damp, clinging uncomfortably to her skin.

“In weather like this, heading out is pure misery,” the driver remarked, his voice laced with a hint of sympathy.

Lola merely nodded in agreement, her gaze drifting to the gray curtain of rain that obscured her view. Memories flooded her mind, pulling her back to just a few days prior when she had braved a tempest far fiercer than this, her feverish body battling the elements to deliver stomach medicine to Charlie Hudson.

On that day, she had cradled a container of clam chowder and the medicine tightly against her chest, determined to keep them dry, as if they were the last vestiges of her resolve. But upon her arrival, she had found herself the unwitting participant in a cruel mockery.

Laughter echoed through the room, sharp and mocking. Someone had confessed to losing a bet, never believing anyone would venture out in such weather for a mere twenty-minute delivery. In that moment, Lola felt the heat of humiliation wash over her, her cheeks burning as if she had been slapped across the face.

Disoriented and filled with an overwhelming sense of betrayal, she turned to Charlie for solace. But his gaze was fixed entirely on the woman sitting beside him—Rose Pearson.

Lola had seen Rose before, her image gracing Charlie’s desk, his phone’s screensaver, and framed photographs in his office. Yet, she had never anticipated their first encounter would unfold in such a humiliating manner. Rose lounged comfortably next to Charlie, draped in his jacket, while Lola stood there, drenched and shivering, water streaming down her hair like a waterfall.

With a polite smile, Rose extended a handful of tissues toward her. “Is this your maid? Braving such heavy rain to make a delivery? Charlie, you’d better remember to give her a raise when you get home.”

Lola’s mind went blank, a swirl of emotions crashing within her. But before she could fully process the insult, her body reacted instinctively, smacking the tissues from Rose’s hand.

The sound was soft, a mere whisper of paper against air, yet it silenced the entire private room in an instant.

Before she could regain her composure, a forceful shove sent her sprawling to the ground. Her head collided with the sharp edge of a glass coffee table, and darkness enveloped her.

When she finally regained consciousness, she found herself in a hospital bed, her head swathed in thick bandages.

The bed beside her lay empty, a stark reminder of her isolation. Charlie was nowhere to be found. Neither was her son, Edwin. Despite having a family, she lay alone in that sterile ward, the silence echoing in her ears like a haunting melody.

As she turned on her phone, her heart sank at the sight of the screen. The only messages waiting for her were spam texts from her service provider. Not a single word of concern or care from anyone she loved.

A tightness gripped her chest, and her eyes stung with unshed tears. She fought against the rising tide of despair and dialed Edwin’s number. She had already given up on Charlie’s affection, but the longing to see her son—her precious child whom she had carried for nine long months—was a desperate need that overwhelmed her.",1,1764142493.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

The autumn hiking season is in full swing, and the weather forecast for the 29th looks absolutely perfect. We’re excited to head over to Kyoto for a trail that mixes history, mythology, and some of the best views in the Kansai region.

# November 29th: Daimonji-yama & The Philosopher's Path Loop ⛰️

We are heading to the famous Daimonji-yama!

# What it will be like

For those new to Kyoto hiking, Daimonji is the mountain with the massive ""大"" (Dai) character burned into it during the Obon festival. We are taking a slightly less traveled route up the ""back side"" of the mountain.

We'll pass by the cave linked to the mythology of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu hiding away and plunging the world into darkness (we'll explain the story on the trail!). Once we reach the summit, we’ll get a panoramic view of the entire Kyoto basin.

After lunch at the top, we’ll head down the front side. Since we are doing a loop this time, we’ll catch the southern end of the historic Philosopher's Path and the Nanzen-ji area before finishing up right where we started.

# The Weather ☀️

We checked the forecast, and we really couldn't ask for better hiking weather.

* **Forecast:** Mostly Sunny
* **Temp:** High of 16°C (61°F) / Low of 6°C (43°F)
* **Wind:** Light breeze

**Difficulty:** ★★★☆☆ (9.6km, 600m elevation gain. Approx 4 hours hiking time + breaks) **Views:** ★★★★★ (One of the best spots to see the Kyoto cityscape) **History:** ★★★★☆ (Mythological caves and historic canals)

# When and where we'll start

We will gather from **10:00 to 10:30**, and we will leave at **10:30 sharp**.

**Meeting Point:** We are meeting at [Keage Station](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cafe+Keage+Akaribasan/@35.0080773,135.7870977,17z/data=!4m23!1m16!4m15!1m6!1m2!1s0x6000e68d184cbfed:0xcddcd36b1d3ff7b9!2sUmeda,+Kita+Ward,+Osaka,+530-0001!2m2!1d135.4957339!2d34.7005588!1m6!1m2!1s0x60010920aba13803:0x107b91c50db20558!2sKeage+Sta.,+Higashikomonozach%C5%8D,+Higashiyama+Ward,+Kyoto,+605-0044!2m2!1d135.7901846!2d35.0082071!3e3!3m5!1s0x600109f4e846b487:0x28723b1b2ae6f399!8m2!3d35.0080774!4d135.7904006!16s%2Fg%2F11vl0l7z2g?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTExNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (Tozai Line) just outside **Exit 1**.

* *Train details:* From Umeda/Osaka, it takes about 53 minutes and costs roughly ¥1,100 each way. You will likely need to transfer once (usually at Karasuma Oike) to get to the Tozai line.

# Lunch & Food 🍙

**Important:** There are **no convenience stores** near the meeting point at Keage Station. Please buy your lunch and snacks **before** you get on the train or during your transfer. We will be eating our packed lunches at the summit while enjoying the view.

# After the Hike ☕

We plan to finish the loop back at Keage Station. For those who have time, we’re planning to stop at the **Keage Cafe** right next to the station to rest our legs, grab a coffee, and chat before heading home.

# What you'll need

* **Water:** Please bring **at least 1 liter** of water. Even in cool weather, this trail has some elevation and hydration is key.
* **Lunch:** As mentioned, bring it with you!
* **Footwear:** Hiking boots are recommended, but comfortable sneakers are okay if you don't have them.
* **Clothing:** 16°C is comfortable while moving, but the summit can be breezy. A fleece or light layer to put on while we eat lunch is highly recommended.
* **Hiking Poles:** Not required, but they always improve stability. Bring them if you have them! We also have a limited number to lend out.

# Other stuff

As always, this event is completely free and everyone is welcome—solo hikers, first-timers, and regulars alike.

**Safety Note:** We take safety very seriously. We choose locations where chances of wildlife encounters are low, but we always carry appropriate safety gear and deterrents as a precaution. We want everyone to feel safe and relaxed on the trail!

Leaving a comment or a PM if you plan to come helps us know who to look out for, but you are also welcome to just show up at the station. Expect to hike with people from all over the world.

1p71ffn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1p71ffn/how_can_i_get_over_my_kinda_ex_for_what_he_did/,How can i get over my kinda ex for what he did even tho i caused it.,"
okay so this is gonna be a long one so i apologize in advance…so Me (22F) and my ex? “Alex” (26M) got together last April. Things were genuinely so great. we were fun, passionate, absolutely head over heels for eachother and then i got stuck in a major depressive episode. no job. ALWAYS in bed. no fun unless alcohol was involved. but unless i was tipsy i didn’t wanna be touched either. Alex stuck through it ALL. i mean he did everything. paid the bills. took care of my cats. laid with me. did everything in his power to keep me afloat and eventually i did get better. 
 When i got better i wasn’t ever good to him again. and then the opposite happened. he has a history with drugs and im not sure when it got so bad but his pill use got way out of hand and instead of helping him the way he helped me i started to go out again. so and talk to who i wanted. i stopped caring because i felt like he did too but truthfully..he was begging for attention. for help. for touch. for anything and i just didn’t give it to him. the only time we got physical was if i was drunk. he asked everyday if i wanted to go on dates or get up in the mornings to get coffee. it was always no. until i wanted something and i feel awful. 
 the worst of it peaked probably around the new year. i was really doing whatever i wanted. and he was on drugs so bad. i didn’t know how bad at the time. 
anyways to get to the whole point of this- about the end of february. i broke up with him. it was weird. we still lived together. we kept falling back into weird routines. still did not touch unless i was absolutely plastered at this point (like seriously in that last month if we did anything physical i remember very little) he was still doing what he could to keep us afloat but i was done. i would tell him we were done probably daily. he just wasn’t accepting that tho. meanwhile. i was going out. i was talking to other people. he was still begging for attention that i couldn’t give. 
so one night- we went out. same place but separately. apparently he met a girl here and like a little over a week later they started talking and eventually he ended up at her apartment. they slept together. i found out QUICK. like two days later. it only happened once. and look. i know. we weren’t together. i was doing my own thing. but this dude TOLD HER we were together. i lost my shit. i lied to the girl to make her feel like shit. i made him out to be this awful person. when i found out-he immediately stopped contact. i asked way too many questions. he didn’t “finish” he couldn’t keep it up. which of course i didn’t believe so i made him call her at one point and she admitted that those things were true because she didn’t know i was listening :) 
he told me he never was attracted to her she was just the only person willing to give him any attention. which i get. anyways fast forward …we got back together and i cheated on him. i’m not proud of it at all but that’s obviously very important. 
 so here’s where im definitely the asshole i think. i CANNOT get over what he did. at all. it’s the humiliation and embarrassment feeling like this girl won. like she felt like she was better than me. felt like she got something over on me because of what he told her and the things she said to me. like how can i be with a man that let this happen? that put me in this position. how do i get over that? i know ur sounds unbelievable but i love this man. i want to get over it so bad but ALL i think about is her. he got over what i did. he does everything for to this day. EVERYTHING. he tries so fucking hard every day and i just can’t get over it. it’s really the humiliation and it’s my fucking fault because i wanted people to believe he was the bad guy. i need advice but really i need to hear it from unbiased people…",2,1764141490.0,Advice,8,0.75,False

Percolation, immersion ( Hario switch) different grind sizes ( zp6) along with all different temps and techniques from just off boil down to 3 pour 70c-90c-90c. Different rations from 1:15-1:17
Just haven't been able to have a cup which I'm ever happy with.

Haven't had this problem with any other blue tokai coffee or any other coffee as such ever. 
What's with this blend.
Have tried less acidic coffees as per Bluetokai but have gotten more acidity in them than this.
Its just super irritating at this point.
I have like 750gm of it more left. So any suggestions from anyone who has had a better recipe for it so as to be able to do justice to the coffee.",3,1764141477.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False
1p71ejz,https://www.reddit.com/r/aistory/comments/1p71ejz/the_coven_of_complications/,The Coven of Complications,"It began, as all regrettable things do, with wine and good intentions.

The three women—Clarissa, Moira, and June—met every Thursday night under the noble pretense of “self-care.” In practice, this meant gossiping, drinking merlot, and complaining about their romantic misfortunes. Clarissa’s boyfriend had the emotional availability of a houseplant. Moira’s husband preferred his gaming console to conversation. And June’s on-again-off-again partner, who described himself as a “creative spirit,” had recently “creatively” vanished with her favorite scarf.

By their third glass, Clarissa—ever the dramatist—slammed her wine down. “We have the power to change our situations,” she declared.

“By what, setting fire to them?” Moira muttered.

“No,” Clarissa said, with a gleam in her eye that should have been a warning. “By magic.”

June blinked. “Magic?”

“Yes! Remember that ‘Modern Wicca for Women Who Wine’ book I bought? We’ll do a ritual. Something simple—just a spell to make them love us properly.”

Moira groaned. “I can’t even make my husband love laundry properly.”

But Clarissa was already clearing the coffee table, lighting candles, and muttering about “channeling divine feminine energy.” Moira rolled her eyes but helped anyway—she’d had just enough wine to find it funny. June fetched the book and read aloud from a spell titled “The Heart’s Alignment: For Romantic Harmony and Mutual Understanding.”

The instructions were simple enough:

 

A strand of your lover’s hair.

 

 

A drop of your own blood.

 

 

Three women chanting as one.

 

Clarissa sliced her finger with a butter knife and dropped the blood into a chalice. Moira found one of her husband’s beard hairs stuck to a couch cushion. June reluctantly produced a single, lint-covered curl she’d saved from her ex “for sentimental reasons.”

They chanted. There were sparks. The lights flickered. The cat hissed.

And when the air went still again, something—something subtle—had shifted.

The next morning, Clarissa woke up to a text from her boyfriend: Good morning, goddess. I’ve been thinking—I should move in with you. That way I can always be near your radiant presence.

At first, she was thrilled. By lunchtime, she was concerned. By dinner, she was regretting everything.

He followed her from room to room, reciting poetry he’d apparently written during his lunch break. He wept when she went to the bathroom. “We’re one soul now, Clarissa,” he said, clutching the doorframe as she tried to close it.

Clarissa sent a panicked group text: Something’s wrong. I think the spell worked TOO well.

Moira’s morning was worse. Her husband was already awake when she came downstairs—cleaning. The house sparkled. The sink was empty. The laundry was folded.

“I just realized,” he said, eyes wide and slightly manic, “you deserve someone who truly helps.”

“Uh, that’s… nice?”

“I made you a color-coded spreadsheet of household chores! And a calendar of date nights! I even made matching aprons!”

Moira texted back: HELP. He’s organizing the Tupperware by volume again.

June, meanwhile, was feeling smug. Her ex had texted at dawn: I can’t stop thinking about you. I was wrong to leave. I want to come back.

By mid-afternoon, he was outside her apartment, guitar in hand, performing a soulful ballad for all the neighbors. It was titled “Scarf of My Heart.”

The crowd clapped. June considered moving to another country.

The three convened again that night, frazzled and bleary-eyed.

“This is bad,” June said. “We need to undo it.”

“Agreed,” Moira said. “Mine’s alphabetizing the spice rack by emotional resonance.”

Clarissa flipped through the book. “There is an ‘Undoing Love’s Binding’ ritual,” she said, squinting. “We just need one thing—each man’s true essence.”

“Meaning?”

“Something that represents his spirit.”

Moira grabbed a spoon. “My husband’s essence is ‘metallic frustration.’”

June brought the scarf. Clarissa plucked one of her boyfriend’s tear-soaked poems from her purse. They chanted again.

The candles flickered. The cat meowed in protest. The wine glasses rattled ominously.

Then—nothing.

The next day, all three men vanished.

Not metaphorically. Literally. Their phones went dead, their apartments were empty, and in their places were… small, oddly lifelike figurines. Moira’s sat on her counter, holding a tiny mop. Clarissa’s was clutching a miniature sonnet. June’s wore a scarf and a look of eternal remorse.

Clarissa screamed.

Moira sighed. “At least he won’t reorganize the spice rack anymore.”

June groaned. “What are we going to do now?”

Clarissa looked thoughtful. “Well… the book does have a chapter called ‘Reanimation and Second Chances.’”

“Absolutely not,” said Moira.

But Clarissa’s eyes already gleamed again—the look of a woman who hadn’t learned her lesson.

The candles came out. The wine poured. And somewhere, faintly, the cat began to hiss again.

1p71eba,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p71eba,What tools would I need to cut a cross section of a log?,"Hello,

I am relatively new to woodworking, and have a 3' diameter log that is about 1' tall (similar to what is pictured.) It is from a large branch that fell in my backyard and I am looking to have it ""sliced"" into 1 inch, flat cross sections. My goal is to sand it, stain it, and attach legs to make it into a coffee table that generally matches the concept of the image above. 

What tooling would I need in order to get it cut into flat cross sections? I took it to a local hardware store that does cuts and they said they didn't have the right saw, and didn't know anybody who did. 

  
I imagine I'd need it cut on some sort of bandsaw, and then have each cross section fed through a planar to make it flat? 

  
I'd like to know what processes it would take to make this happen, and how to get connected with a shop/mill that does this sort of thing. ",5,1764141380.0,woodworking,5,1.0,False

A few months later  in Aug 2024 We had to move to California. We decided to live with his sister till we got situated. Incredible woman. She takes everyone under her wing. She took us under her wing. We love her. Husband lost his job jan 2025 and his mental health went south. He was battling CPTSD and depression. During our stay, I got close with sister in law and brother in law. They were a mixed family and had 5 kids. She got pregnant and delivered an 6’th angel Jan 31 2025. From Dec 2024 to Jan 2025, brother in law and i went snowboarding. Twice with kids, twice alone. I knew him as a family man. Everyone said he LOVED SIL and his family. That he is trustworthy. He and by husband were considered brothers. So i felt safe to go with him alone. The second time(last time) we went, we did the night round snowboarding at Boreal. We got wet. I was wearing same shorts i wear at their house and at the gym under my snow pants. It is an unflattering black short that comes down more than short shorts. They look like biker shorts. So it does hug the body but it is softer and looser. Like a bad Amazon purchase. No bur lifting cute short. It was 6:30 pm and dark  and many cars had left the parking. We would laugh and joke like anyone else would. The normal stuff. Nothing sexual or suggestive. We were about to sit in the car when i said “omg I am so wet, don’t worry I will take my pants off, i have shorts under ”. And i did.  English is not my first language but i am pretty good at it as you can see but sometimes I might say things the wrong way. We sat in the car and be put his hand on my shoulder and started rubbing my shoulder and said “you didn’t get the massage you wanted to get?” I was frozen. I am generally non confrontational and don’t make any moves from the fear of being wrong. He pulls my shirt up a but so his hands are NOT touching my skin and I think to myself “ok, he put a barrier between his skin and mine. This is good. This is safe”. After 10 seconds which felt like an hour I nervously laughed and pulled back. It was awkward silence and i got uncomfortable so i said “thank you. Very kind of you”. He suddenly said “you had me at I am wet” and put his hands between my legs and grabbed me and pulled me close to kiss me or something (it is a blur) and i just started pushing him back saying Chris.. chris… you are high… you are high! He was not that high. He only hit a pen on the slopes. But when i get uncomfortable from catching someone in a lie or get second hand embarrassment, I give outs. So i was trying to blame the weed. He stopped and sat in silence. A terrifying silence. All this took maybe 5 seconds. Maybe less. I managed not to get assaulted. He was my ride back home in the dark and snow. 1.5 hrs from Roseville. I was terrified. I watch one too many true crime. I thought he could kill me and make it look like an accident. So i started laughing and talking. He said he is so confused. He thought I was a hall pass because we were staying at their house. That he was confused why his wife would let him go alone with a hot ass chick. That i was too friendly. That the previous time i had put my hair up in a bun and sprayed perfume on me ( IT WAS NOT PERFUME! IT WAS SUNSCREEN😭. MAKES NO SENSE TO PUT HAIR UP FOR PERFUME THEN PUT IT DOWN TO  WEAR SNOWBOARDING HELMET! MAKES SENSE TO PUT HAIR UP TO PUT SUNSCREEN ON SO SUNSCREEN WON’T GET IN HAIR THEN BRING HAIR DOWN THEN POT HELMET ON!!!😭😭😭😭). He said I had called him my buddy and that meant F’buddy! I have many guy friends I call buddy and none of them have ever taken it that way. Husband was having chronic pain so i would go with fb group people, guys or girls hiking, etc and in front of SIL i had mentioned we can go hiking and he had thought I was into him! I said yes you are right i am friendly. It is ok. It is nature. All is good. You made a mistake. Men can’t understand the difference between a friendly smile and flirting and it is evolutionary, etc. i was rambling to make things normal and to get back home. He confessed in the car he had fingered a mother of his kids friends at an amusement park (when SIL got sick and stayed in hotel). I calmly mentioned if he had done more he would have felt like crap. That is he has sex with me, afterwards he would feel like crap. He agreed. But he also said, “it had been 8 days”. All the 1.5 hrs i was talking like i was talking to a friend. I said i had hooked up with a girl (dunno why i said that but i did) and many more things i have no memory of (even that hook up came up of i wouldn’t have remembered it). We get home, i promise to act normal. In my head, he made a mistake but i was the reason for that mistake. He even said when i mentioned hiking, all he thought of was bending me behind a tree. I just laughed and said something like “oh you are silly”. We came home, he went to SIL and kissed her and professed his love for her. I wanted to vomit. In 12 days we found a house and i forced husband to leave. I said nothing. I had no evidence. No proof. No one would believe me. More over, SIL had JUST given birth. They had such an amazing life. It would be  catastrophic! 

We had concert tickets for reggae rise up in April 2025. Husband and I and him, We go. First night he gets high and drunk he slaps my booty and says “damn girl”, in the 60 seconds husband was to grab something from the car. I laugh and back up. Say nothing until we fly back home then send him this:

“Hey Chris. Been wanting to text you for a while. I wanted you to know that i absolutely enjoy hanging out with you and SIL. I love that HUSBAND can call you brother and enjoy mutual activities with you. That being said, I need you to keep boundaries if we want to keep the enjoyable time we have together. It seems like I need to make myself clearer as my objection to your advances  the first time you crossed family boundary lines didn’t solidify my absolute request for you to respect me. I waited for the trip to end before I send this text because I wanted you to not have negative feelings and to be able to enjoy the music festival. I am none confrontational and it is hard for me to immediately confront a violation as mentioned to you before on our way back from Boreal. When you slapped me on my behind and said “damn girl” the first night of our stay, I felt violated, disrespected and unsafe but I said nothing. But deep down I was extremely stressed until HUSBAND came. As a matter of a fact, i felt even more disrespected than when you thought I was a “hall pass” offered to you at boreal. I made it clear at Boreal that under no circumstances will I agree to step on any boundaries and so should you. I talked all the way home to make sure you understood whatever action you can’t do in front of WIFE, is considered inappropriate. With whomever! May that person be me or a single mom of your kids’s friends at an amusement park, even talking to them sexually or flirtatiously is disrespectful if WIFE deems it as such. I thought we agreed how wrong that was. And that how terrible you would have felt if you went past fingering that chick or if you actually managed to have sex with me! Even as a joke (which we both know there were no jokes), it is NOT ok.

That day I promised you nothing will change in my behavior and that I will tell no one. I asked for you to act normal and for us to forget what happened at Boreal and to move forward. However, this second instance happened not even 2 full months later!!!! If you think drugs make you irrational, then please stick to the limit you can handle (I know you don’t believe this matter is substance related but I can’t think of any other reason). Please respect me as a friend and as your sister in law. As explained before and as you have seen in person, I have many guy friends. If any of them at any point disrespects me, there will be no second chances for them. You are getting more chances because you are family.

I want to be able to feel safe around you. I want to be able to laugh and joke and play and hangout with you guys without you thinking I am available to be violated. I should not feel I am walking on eggshells around you. If it is not possible for you to be alone with me inform me and i will avoid that circumstance at any cost to help you in preventing a disaster. I will save you from yourself if you need me to help you to do so.

I have showed you before I can act normal and forgive and forget. I will do so a second time too. The only difference is that, the first time this happened and you promised me to respect me, I felt confident that all is good and i am safe with you. This time, not so much. Right now my brain thinks “if Chris can’t control himself around me, how will he act when there are no eyes watching him”. I feel like betraying WIFE by keeping this information from her. But I will proceed to acting normal and I will promise you I will not say anything. However, if a third time happens, with or without substances being involved, I will inform HUSBAND and even though HUSBAND will not fight with you, he certainly will calmly inform his sister. Even if SIL decides to forgive you, neither HUSBAND nor SIL will be able to see you the same ever again. 

We have an awesome relationship Chris. family wise, I mean. We can all have a great time together for years to come. From trips to concerts to family gatherings to being there for each other in hard times and fun times. Please don’t mess what we have up. Pleas don’t fuck up you, WIFE and the kids’ life. Please don’t take away what we all have together, family. Please let me restore my trust and faith in you. This shit hurts. It hurts to keep secrets and it hurts to know at any time an entire family can fall apart if i open my mouth.

I will keep my mouth shut and stay amicable. No need to stress this time, just like last time. but there better be no third time, Chris. 

Lets act normal. Don’t bring it up to me. Don’t tell me you are sorry. Don’t bring justifications all men use because all those excuses are as old as time. Show me in action.”

He responds : “I realize I put you in a very awkward and uncomfortable situation and completely understand your stance if anything is ever said or done again that may be considered inappropriate. I do need to make some changes and prioritize so I don’t continue to hurt people I care about. I appreciate you letting me know it’s wrong and won’t be tolerated, hopefully time will show that I can respectful to all of you. “

I remained silent. I was scared i will mess up SIL’s life. I tried going out for coffee with SIL and telling her but the worlds would not come out. A few nights ago she saw those texts. She found out and put all of us in one room. Pretty gangster move i should say. He was heartbroken.  She blamed me for not telling her. I understand I should have but there were so many factors that stopped me. So many fears. Guilt. Did i keep eye contact too long? Did i smile too much? Did i say the wrong thing? Was i too friendly? Were my shorts too short? Was it me? 

Chris confessed in front of SIL and husband that he put his hand between my legs but because he was confused! Because i had put my hair up in a bun and put perfume on! I yelled it was sunscreen! I explained it in the car on our way back!!! SIL rightfully is heartbroken and devastated. I love her so much. I betrayed her by not telling her. The words she was saying were heartbreaking. She wants space from me. FROM ME! she is now with her husband trying to work things out. Came to light that chick chris fingered was the mom of one of the cheer leaders and happened when SIL was sick in the hotel. His move was so bold that i am CERTAIN these two incidents are not the only ones. He came on to me with SUCH CONFIDENCE! 

He initially said he was sorry. SIL in her overload of emotions got mad that we talked about sex in the car. I couldn’t get her to understand I wanted to survive by making it look like not a big deal. A few days have passed. Husband talked with SIL and it cane to light from her that chris is using micro lies with the backing up of Chris’s best friend (Kevin) to cover the truth and pin it on me! Kevin confirmed i flirt!!!!!!!!!! While i hVe NEVER been around kevin without husband being around. I never joke and laughed more than family and friends would do. But now all of my friendliness is being used against me. SIL believes it was Chris’s actions but still told husband that I flirted too!!!! I am shaking as i am saying these. I never cried from jan 31 2025 till a few days ago. Since this came to light i have been feeling hatered, anger, guilt, shame, sadness, anxiety, disbelief regarding SIL falling for the calculated lies. I will never want to be in the same room as them. This lie they are making up about me hurts the most because it is NOT true and NOT who I am! I lost SIL. I lost my only friend here . I have a lot of strong emotions. Been going from crying, to shaking, to cursing and back to crying. SIL is so great and this is so out of character but i get it. 

So i have text messages and confession in front of two people. So i have a super solid case per ChatGPT whom i have given more details.

But here is the twist. SIL is a high paying nurse. Chris works on and off random AC jobs and is currently out of job. SIL actually is bad ass and fought in court for chris agains Chris’s ex. She is a pro in everything she puts her mind to. Their assets are mixed. If she doesn’t divorce him (which seems she will try to salvage it) my going to court will hurt her too. Financially the most. I am one of the few lucky ones that can even sue. These apply to my case Sexual Battery (California Penal Code §243.4) and Assault with Intent to Commit Sexual Offense (PC §220)

But half my MIL’s house and bald of SIL’s house is under his name. If I proceed, i will lose here for ever. And she is one of the pillars of our family. Husband is 100% on my side but is torn for how this will impact his sister.

It is a messy situation. I don’t know how else to fight for my dignity because micro lies are burying the truth. And over time she will get brainwashed. And if i go to court, i will hurt a person who is a victim too that i adore (even if she now needs distance). 

I will end abruptly. At least i have husband who 100% believes me. But i don’t know why it is so important for me to prove i did not do anything to have warranted this.

THC is kicking in. I can win. I have all the things to prove. Yet I can’t use it. Passing out from lack of sleep. Had not slept at all and finally it is getting to me. 

Why… why after 11 months i am crumbling. I swear i am a bad ass. I hiked mt Whitney in one day out and back. I am strong. I, like other wives of veterans, am strong. I don’t know how and why something so little has brought me to my knees!!! It didn’t get raped! I survived! Nothing REALLY happened as i fended him off. Why now? These feelings are not helping and i am overwhelmed with it all. I want things to go back to normal. Just NORMAL. Not perfect! Normal😭😭😭😭

Dunno why am i even here. With such a trivial incident while there are woman who  have been legit assaulted. I am lost. I am disappointed and mad and heartbroken. 

I hope ONE person reads. Just one. I just want to be heard and believed. I didn’t realize i was causing issues. I thought we were all buddies. This is disappointing and heartbreaking.

1p71djh,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1p71djh/switching_to_healthy_eating/,Switching to healthy eating,"Hi everyone!

I feel like my whole life I havent eaten good. For as long as I can remember, my normal eating day would go as follows:
- Skip breakfast
- Maybe up to 3 times a week make an easy home-cooked meal (not a good one, mostly just quesidillas with 1 vegetable on them)
- Something frozen to put in the over
- 1 or 2 sugary drinks from either McDonald's or starbucks
- End the day with a bag of chips

The past month and almost a half, I've been eating (I would consider) really good. I haven't gone out and gotten coffee anywhere, I've been making it at home. I've been homecooking everything, including any snacks I may eat through the day. Its probably not the healthiest but in my mind I am very proud of myself lol. For example, today I ate:

Breakfast - coffee + homemade chocolate chip pancakes (1)
Lunch - left over rice bowl from yesterday (Tofu, tomatoes, bell peppers, multigrain rice) and made a stir fry
Dinner - bagel with cottage cheese + tomatoes + bell peppers
Late night - made a strawberry banana yogurt chia seed smoothie

Ive been cooking different things every day, but I feel like for the past month this is what it has normally looked like. For breakfast, sometimes I have had yogurt and then I always end the day with a chocolate chip pancake (it has been my indulgence and kept me going, also I only have 1).

Anyways, so this may not be the healthiest thing ever but for me its a drastic improvement. Every now and then I still get a yummy drink from Starbucks. The only problem is, at the end of every day since I started this I have so much stomach pain, and cramps, and then it turns into tons of painful gas in my whole abdomen. I wake up feeling fine. My only question is, is this normal when you start eating healthy (ish)? Especially after still having the cramps at night time a month later? It almost makes me want to go back to my other routine because im getting tired of ending my days feeling so sick. On the other side though, it makes me wonder what I was even eating before that my body just doesnt know how to handle normal food.

1p71czq,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1p71czq/matched_with_the_wrong_person/,Matched With the Wrong Person,"I matched with a guy named Liam on Tinder a few weeks ago. His profile looked perfectly normal: a gym selfie, a picture with a dog, and one photo in front of a mirror. He was polite and responsive, almost overly polite. He wrote like someone trying very hard to sound human.

When I suggested a video call, he always had an excuse. First the camera was broken, then the microphone stopped working, then he said his WiFi was unstable. Every reason sounded rehearsed. I told him we couldn’t meet unless we video chatted first. He apologized and said he was embarrassed but still wanted to meet in a public place for coffee.

Just to be safe, I reverse-image searched his photos. The first two popped up instantly on a fitness model’s Instagram account. I wasn’t surprised; a lot of people use stolen pictures.

Then I opened the last photo. My entire body went cold. It wasn’t a stock image. It wasn’t from Instagram. It was taken inside my old apartment. The chipped windowsill, the weirdly low radiator, the pattern of the curtains—I recognized everything immediately. The mirror in the photo was the one I bought from IKEA. The corner of a poster I owned was visible on the wall.

The figure in the mirror had a hood pulled low, face completely hidden.

I messaged him and asked where he got that third picture. He replied instantly: “Do you like it? I took it for you.”

I blocked him immediately and called the police. They said that since no direct threat was made and no crime had technically occurred, there wasn’t much they could do. They just told me to keep records of any future contact.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I checked every closet, every corner of my new place. I knew it wasn’t the same apartment, but it didn’t matter. Fear changes what feels logical.

At 3 a.m., my phone vibrated beside my bed. It was a Tinder notification: “New match!” I hadn’t opened the app since blocking him.

The profile name on the new match was “CloserThanYouThink.” The profile photo was a grainy shot of my hallway, taken from low to the ground. The timestamp showed it had been taken less than 10 minutes earlier.

I dialed 911 while trying to stay silent. The police arrived quickly, but the apartment was empty. They found muddy footprints near the back door. The prints led out, not in, like he had been inside already and slipped away as they arrived.

The locks showed no damage. No tampering. They told me to install additional security, but even with that advice, they seemed unsure of how he got in.

I moved out within days. I deleted every dating app. I changed my number and replaced all my locks.

Every now and then, though, I’ll get a Tinder notification even though I deleted the app. It always shows the same message: “New match.”

1p71cyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1p71cyo/matched_with_the_wrong_person/,Matched With the Wrong Person,"I matched with a guy named Liam on Tinder a few weeks ago. His profile looked perfectly normal: a gym selfie, a picture with a dog, and one photo in front of a mirror. He was polite and responsive, almost overly polite. He wrote like someone trying very hard to sound human.

When I suggested a video call, he always had an excuse. First the camera was broken, then the microphone stopped working, then he said his WiFi was unstable. Every reason sounded rehearsed. I told him we couldn’t meet unless we video chatted first. He apologized and said he was embarrassed but still wanted to meet in a public place for coffee.

Just to be safe, I reverse-image searched his photos. The first two popped up instantly on a fitness model’s Instagram account. I wasn’t surprised; a lot of people use stolen pictures.

Then I opened the last photo. My entire body went cold. It wasn’t a stock image. It wasn’t from Instagram. It was taken inside my old apartment. The chipped windowsill, the weirdly low radiator, the pattern of the curtains—I recognized everything immediately. The mirror in the photo was the one I bought from IKEA. The corner of a poster I owned was visible on the wall.

The figure in the mirror had a hood pulled low, face completely hidden.

I messaged him and asked where he got that third picture. He replied instantly: “Do you like it? I took it for you.”

I blocked him immediately and called the police. They said that since no direct threat was made and no crime had technically occurred, there wasn’t much they could do. They just told me to keep records of any future contact.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I checked every closet, every corner of my new place. I knew it wasn’t the same apartment, but it didn’t matter. Fear changes what feels logical.

At 3 a.m., my phone vibrated beside my bed. It was a Tinder notification: “New match!” I hadn’t opened the app since blocking him.

The profile name on the new match was “CloserThanYouThink.” The profile photo was a grainy shot of my hallway, taken from low to the ground. The timestamp showed it had been taken less than 10 minutes earlier.

I dialed 911 while trying to stay silent. The police arrived quickly, but the apartment was empty. They found muddy footprints near the back door. The prints led out, not in, like he had been inside already and slipped away as they arrived.

The locks showed no damage. No tampering. They told me to install additional security, but even with that advice, they seemed unsure of how he got in.

I moved out within days. I deleted every dating app. I changed my number and replaced all my locks.

Every now and then, though, I’ll get a Tinder notification even though I deleted the app. It always shows the same message: “New match.”

I don't read romance or smut, but hey it's a huge genre and my wife loves (and I love that she does, anything she likes is good with me!) it so I thought why not try to give her a memorable gift and make a highly exaggerated erotic novel about how we met?

I do write, but mainly essays and novella length works that are just thinly veiled essays masquerading as stories. So I first did my research and read some erotica, romance, smut. Writing in a ""fun"" easy to digest style was actually one of the hardest parts of this project for me.

I used AI to create some pictures for the novel as well as the covers. This was the only AI used during this process. I've never really done much AI image generation, so getting it to spit out consistent looking characters took quite some effort. I printed those on instax film and attached NFC chips to the back of each picture with a link to a playlist that she can listen to. I also have a score for the book that is all chill instrumental music that can be a vibe while reading and figure the playlists will be something to go back and discover after the initial read.

After finishing the book I essentially found ways to make the book the hub for a slew of other gifts. These range from normal little gifts like a coffee mug, very sentimental gifts like a book of our message archive from Facebook when we first met at work, or more intimate gifts like...intimates.

I just wanted to make a video and a few posts to share my ideas - maybe others will get some inspiration and take it to entirely new levels.

Anyways, thats it. It's not Christmas yet so I'm definitely open to any feedback or ideas as well!",1,1764141167.0,SpicyRomanceBooks,0,1.0,False

The Global Revival of Craft in a Digital Age,"In 2021, a quiet video went viral: a New York designer whisking matcha in a hand-thrown bowl, sunlight flashing across its uneven glaze. Millions watched, not because of the tea—but because of the *bowl*.

The caption read: **“My phone moves fast. My bowl slows me down.”**

This moment captured something bigger: a worldwide rediscovery of **handmade objects**. Not Chinese, Japanese, Nordic, or Mexican specifically—but *human*.

Across cultures, a shared longing is emerging.

# The Universal Rebirth of Craft

A 2023 UCLA study shows that people under 35 increasingly turn to tactile, handmade objects as anchors in a hyper-digital world. Whether it’s Japanese raku bowls, Moroccan zellige tiles, Scandinavian woodwork, Mexican barro negro, or Chinese celadon cups.

We are witnessing the same phenomenon: Humans reaching for objects infused with touch, time, and story. These objects aren’t just “things.” They are **ritual devices** \- used to ground, slow, and reconnect.

# A New Definition of Luxury

Luxury used to be about rarity or logos. Now it’s about *legibility*:

* Who made this?
* What tradition does it carry?
* Why does it look the way it does?
* How does it shape a ritual in daily life?

Whether it’s a handwoven textile from Oaxaca or a porcelain cup from Jingdezhen, people want **objects with lineage and intention**. This is the global shift Glazara was born into: crafting pieces that honor heritage while embracing modern beauty.

# Not Tradition vs. Modern — But Both

Today’s craft revival isn’t backwards-looking. It’s integrative.

A Moroccan potter may collaborate with a London designer.  
A Chinese celadon glaze might be paired with Scandinavian silhouettes.  
A Canadian ceramicist might study Japanese firing methods.

This creative cross-pollination is redefining how we understand “craft.” And that’s exactly where contemporary artisanship is heading: **tradition as foundation, modernity as expression.**

# Why Humans Crave Handmade Ritual Objects

According to a 2024 Oxford neuropsychology paper, interacting with handmade objects activates the brain’s **default mode network**, associated with calmness, introspection, and sensory grounding. This explains why handmade ceramics, textiles, furniture, and tools are becoming part of people’s morning rituals, coffee habits, and quiet moments.

We are not collecting objects. We are collecting **states of mind**.

# Craft as a Global Language

Whether a bowl comes from Jingdezhen, Kyoto, Oaxaca, or a small studio in Toronto, one truth holds: People respond to **care**. The unique fingerprint of a glaze. The hand-chiseled line in a piece of wood. The rhythmic pattern of a loom. The fire-mark from a kiln.

Craft transcends origin. It becomes a universal aesthetic - one that says:**“This was made with intention.”**

# The Role of Modern Craft Brands

Brands like Glazara stand at this crossroads:

* honoring the deep heritage of Chinese ceramics
* embracing global design influences
* partnering with artisans worldwide
* creating pieces meant for modern rituals
* designing for homes from Singapore to Stockholm

The geography is a beginning, not a limitation. Their mission is cultural translation, not cultural confinement.

# Conclusion: A Global Movement of Slowness

As one Redditor wrote in r/DesignPorn: **“We’re not buying objects. We’re buying breath.”**

And perhaps that’s why handmade craft is returning everywhere - not as nostalgia, not as nationalism, but as a universal human yearning for beauty, grounding, and meaning.",1,1764140471.0,u_Glazara,0,1.0,False

There was one time I had food and they assured me it was gluten free but I had suspicions it wasn't half way through the meal. I assumed it was fine as I didn't react but now this has happened with the syrup I wonder if I've had more gluten than I realised. 

Is this normal? When diagnosed I didn't have the typical 'gastro' symptoms at all, I was very tired and my b12 was severely low which is why they tested TTG. They tested my blood and found I had a week positive for coeliac 38 u/ml. I then had a biopsy done and it said there was 'evidence of some villi atrophy' but seemed very non committal, but I was diagnosed and have been gluten free since 2019.

I've always wondered whether it was a false positive? Or is it normal to eat gluten and not have a reaction?

I 29M have 2 kids 2 and 4 yo that I love to bits my wife 30F is due for number 3 early next year. She has never worked  and is currently a SAHM and wants to do home-schooling as the kids grow older so no second income for quite some time. Im onbord with the home schooling but feel like with the cost of living going crazy, my end of the deal is getting worse and worse.

I have a stressful job that isn't great pay. 2200 per fortnight base with plenty of overtime opportunities. When working 60+ hrs a week i don't have time for the family and when working 40 hrs i have no money for the family.

Over the last few years I've quit drinking, smoking, and barley buy fastfood anymore. I spend so little on myself now that I get exited about little things like work buying me new safety boots or getting a new deodorant while grocery shopping haha.

All my clothes are old and faded
Steak is no longer on the shopping list
Coffee is made at home
Haircuts are done by myself 
The list goes on.....

15-20 years left on the mortgage depending on how much extra gets thrown on it.

I love that I can give my wife the opportunity to stay at home with the kids but I hate that it litterly takes so much from my life. 

Now days this doesn't even get appreciate as SAHMs say the 12 hours im at work they are working looking after the kids (i do agree). but all my coworkers whos partners went back to work don't have to give up all there luxurys but the single income familys do.

After 6 months of nights and weekends, I finally shipped RivalReel. The idea came from watching my friend group slowly drift apart after college. We'd go weeks without talking, then feel weird reaching out. I wanted something that gave us a daily reason to share what we're up to - without the pressure of curated Instagram posts. How it works: - Every midnight, everyone gets the same community challenge (""Show us your morning coffee"" or ""What's on your desk right now"") - You also get personalized AI challenges based on your interests - Flash challenges pop up throughout the day for spontaneous moments - See how your friends interpreted the same prompt differently The tech stack: [share your actual stack here - devs love this] What I learned: - Building social apps is HARD when you need critical mass to be fun - AI personalization was way more complex than expected - TestFlight feedback was invaluable.

It's great but I'm looking for an upgrade option to use at home. I was going for the X Ultra but I see so many mentions of how its burrset is the same? as the Q series burrs, and so I'm wondering if it makes sense (considering it's in my budget) to go for the K Ultra instead. My wife and I only drink pourover, although maaaaybe we'll try espresso much later down the line. I'm just getting confused by all the talk online and was hoping I could get some more (relatively) objective info on the grind quality differences between Q Air, X Ultra, and K Ultra. Thanks!

Edit: to clarify the misleading title, I guess what I'm asking is if the coffee quality jumps more from X to K than the jump from Q to X. From what people say, it seems like the actual coffee produced by the Q and the X should be quite similar because of the similar burrsets? If that is the case, then should I jump to the K for better quality pourovers (especially for clarity of tasting notes and so on).

When do the nightmares stop?,"I still have PTSD nightmares. Last night our restaurant got really busy right before close and we had already shut down one side (the salad case, no tea coffee, lemonade/juice or pop). That was already giving me anxiety because I'm having to spend twice as much time getting drinks and appetizers. My section was filling up so quickly, I kept forgetting things and I wasn't sure which table had came in first or how long they were sitting there. I can't ever find anything, like going to make a salad and there's no salad base. I go to the back and there's none made up because the kitchen prep was just watching YouTube videos. So many things had been put away because we were so close to close and everyone is getting really angry and not tipping. I wasn't able to pre-bus anything because I was slammed. The restaurant that I worked at, 11 different times, didn't do a wait list. If you had a table open, you were getting sat even if it was your third table after an 18 top then just came in and you haven't even finished getting their drinks yet. It was always a mess but is this normal? I eventually moved to to go orders because I made more on the hour, and made just as much, if not more, in tips. I always offered to bring it out to people's car because more than likely they are going to tell you to keep the change. Every now and then I would throw a coupon on there when they did that and now their total is 30% cheaper so the change is 30% more. I really enjoyed that because I could tell people, we're really busy you're going to have to give us 40 minutes... Doesn't work that way when they are dining in. They know their food is sitting up there because they can see it and when you are doing to go orders you don't have to worry about refills, you don't have to get salads / soup / appetizers out before the food.

As the title explains my surgery included those 3 things at once: gastric sleeve, gallbladder and hiatus hernia removal, It´s been almost 4 months PO. 

I started with 128 kg which is 282.2 lbs and now I´m 240 lbs which means I´ve lost 42.2 lbs and counting (hopefully), but I have to be honest when sharing that I fear not loosing weight every single day, my goal is to loose 95 lbs. 

Having the gallbladder removed did not make the recovery process any easier to be honest, it took me around 2 months to really feel I was starting to feel ""normal"" when eating, and I still think, like someone shared in a post before, that I won´t fit in the chair, or been able to ride on a park ride, or many other intrusive thoughts that were normal.

Not getting into old habits with food is one of my main concerns, it´s an everyday fight, because I´m pretty clear that worrying will not help the process... I´m focusing in been positive about it and getting to trust in me... which is not easy to do, but for this to work, I need to trust that I can do it, that I can trust in me. 

I fear eating, not that I have stop doing it, but I fear over eating, I fear getting use to eat... for those able to loose 90lbs or more: did you guys did any special process? smoothie? what do you guys eat on a daily basis?

I am currently on a 1200 calories diet, with 6 eating times (i almost never eat 6 times a day) I do not eat snacks, sweets, sodas, sugar of any kind (just the fruits) ... I do take a cup of coffee with milk (twice or 3 times a day) ...

**My 1200 calories plan:**

*-Breakfast: 1 egg and a cracker or 1 slice of whole wheat bread*  
*-1 Snack: 1 yogurt + 1 small fruit (such as a pear)*

*-Lunch: 60 grams of protein (fish, chicken, beef) + 1/2 cup of vegetables + 1/2 cup of rice/pasta/mash potatoes* 

*-2 Snack: a cracker with light cheese*

*Dinner: 60 grams of protein (fish, chicken, beef) + 1/2 cup of vegetables + 1/2 cup of rice/pasta/mash potatoes* 

*-3 Snack: 1 cup of de-lactose milk + 1 package of sugar free crackers*

It wasn’t the grand kind of “first intimate encounter” people write poems about. It was just the library in the afternoon, the lights a bit dim, my neck stiff from bending over my paper for too long. He handed me a cup of coffee warmed in his palms and said softly, “Take a break. You can keep going later.” The moment I looked up, it felt like a room inside me, one that had been dark for a long time was gently lit.

I used to think loneliness was a destiny, a long road I was meant to walk alone. As if only by being independent enough could I avoid being controlled in a relationship. I really did get used to carrying things on my own, thinking on my own, swallowing emotions quietly, packing away all the low-pressure weather inside me, and then pretending everything was fine when I had to be around other people. But when that cup of coffee slid into my hands today, I suddenly realized intimacy isn’t about taking something away, it’s about lifting a little weight off me, so I don’t have to shoulder everything every single time.

Intimacy, I found, isn’t intrusion, isn’t possession, and isn’t losing freedom. It’s those few seconds when I’m not talking, not explaining, not performing strength, and someone naturally moves a little closer. In that moment, I understood that loneliness isn’t an endpoint. It’s just the space you live in while waiting for someone who can walk beside you. When someone approaches, loneliness doesn’t disappear, but it becomes less sharp, less of a wall, more of a chair. A place where you can finally sit down and rest instead of pretending you’re capable of carrying everything forever.

Writing this last line, I felt a small softness in my chest. Maybe being a “big girl” means admitting I’m not unbreakable, and I don’t need to be. Intimacy isn’t a weakness. It’s simply a reminder that I don’t have to walk to sunrise alone.",1,1764139658.0,TheBigGirlDiary,0,1.0,False

I quit drinking coffee 8 months ago, and this is my journey. I’ve had sleep problems on and off my whole life, and 8 months ago I ended up on this Reddit thread where someone wrote: if you have sleep problems and you drink coffee – stop complaining. Now. So I went cold turkey and quit immediately.

I drank about 4 cups a day and had only stopped before when I was pregnant, and at one point I had cut out all caffeine except my morning cup. This time it was a disaster. I lay in the fetal position for 14 days. First I had a headache from hell, and then my body hurt so much I couldn’t sleep. Painkillers helped for the first 24 hours, but after that it was just about riding out the storm.

I got a lot of help on the forum to understand the mechanisms behind it: adenosine being blocked by caffeine, which leads to an overload of adenosine, which means you get “adenosine poisoning” when you suddenly remove the coffee. For me, feeling that sick was absolutely decisive — it’s been easy not to even consider drinking coffee again.

But when I gradually started feeling better (and could think clearly), I started wondering why I had felt THAT bad. I “forced” a few people around me to quit, and sure — they got a bit of a headache, but nothing close to what I went through. My conclusion is that my body doesn’t break down caffeine very well, so I had a very high dose circulating (and hence my extreme difficulty falling asleep even with just one cup a day).

I also had hyperemesis gravidarum during both my pregnancies, and there’s also a theory there that the liver doesn’t break down hormones properly so you get “poisoned” (the only thing that eased my nausea was IV fluids — because it diluted the blood…).

Today my sleep is so much better. Above all, I feel that the physical stress I always felt — even when I was trying to sleep — is gone. Before, I could be completely exhausted but my body was still “running” — now it goes into REST. It took six months before I really felt the effects. On top of that, the cracking in my knees disappeared and my skin is much softer.

A new discovery, now 8 months after quitting, is that I’ve tried decaf coffee on three occasions — and every time it has resulted in a *fatal* headache. Could it be due to the body’s memory of caffeine? That the body responds to the taste of coffee by releasing a surge of adenosine?

So I recommend that anyone with sleep problems at least give it a try. The worse you feel during withdrawal, the greater the chances you’ll notice big changes :-)",1,1764139443.0,quitcoffee,0,1.0,False

(Postgame included),"Hi all, I decided to do a self-imposing challenge run where I can only use Etrian Variant mons and I have to box the team I use to clear the boss before each level limit raise.   
  
Overall, it's a fairly challenging run, especially early on since there's very few passive weather setters (Sunflora & Ninetales for Sun, Wailord for Rain and none for Sand & Hail) and most early boss fights up until the Underground City are against weather teams (Rockey with Sand, Manu with Sun & Cassian with Rain). However, later on it became a bit easier, partially because there's not a lot of weather teams on the boss side and you also get access to higher lvl evolution mons with better BST and movepool.

Hardest fight in the game for me is Manu (her Life Orb Chlorophyll Venusaur gave me PTSD alongside the absolute tank Entei), followed closely by Rockey (same deal with his Sand Rush Sandslash and Shift Gear Skarmory).

Feel free to attempt this challenge yourself and let me know how it goes!

“we’re getting you something to eat at mcdonald’s on the way back to the hotel, okay?” she shouted over the fading music.

“that sounds fun!” he said, swaying in place, gravity unsure of him. then, squinting at another line of strangers, “wait—that looks like another bar. we should go there!”

“nope,” she said, pulling him in the opposite direction before he could wander off again. their friends were already further ahead, dissolving into the quiet part of the street. “mcdonald’s. remember?”

“right, right.” he draped an arm around her shoulder, warm and heavy, the kind of closeness that felt accidental. “you know… you can really sing.”

she laughed; his words were losing structure now, sliding into one another.

“promise me you’ll always, *always* sing,” he said suddenly, leaning closer — a faint whiff of his perfume, something clean, warm, and subtle. the kind of scent that doesn’t hit you all at once but lingers softly, as if it wasn’t meant to be noticed. she caught it for a heartbeat before it slipped away, leaving a quiet imprint in her mind.

“alright,” she said, trying not to give weight to a moment that could easily collapse under its own softness. “but i’m not that good. chris is better.” referring to her friend who was also assisting their drunk friend ahead of them. 

“no she’s not,” he said immediately. “YOU are better.”

she looked away quickly, cheeks warming, uncertain whether to take him seriously or chalk it up to alcohol.

“i swear, my hometown has way better singers. i’m at the bottom of the list.”

“but they’re not you,” he replied simply, as if the explanation were self-evident.

she didn’t know what to do with that. so she said, ""okay, if i were to, let's say, make a youtube account. would you subscribe then?""

""of course!"" he exlaimed. ""i'd be the first one to do so!"" 

his jacket slid off his shoulder and onto the ground, and he stared at it with the helplessness of someone who no longer trusted his balance.

“i’ll get it,” she said, picking it up and dusting it off. “it’s getting cold. you should wear this.”

he shook his head. “no. you wear it.”

“i already have a jacket.”

“but you need it more than i do.”

and he placed it over her shoulders himself, careful and unhurried, as though the act carried meaning he couldn’t articulate.

she smiled. “thank you.”

somewhere along the sidewalk, his hand found hers. not deliberately — or maybe deliberately, she couldn’t tell. their fingers intertwined at some point without either of them marking the exact moment. his thumb brushed the back of her hand absentmindedly, a small, rhythmic warmth.

they stopped at the crosswalk. the city around them was almost silent, a strange calm after the noise of the night.

for a moment, it looked like something borrowed from a film — two near-strangers, suspended in a quiet street, illuminated by a stubborn streetlamp. she let out a soft laugh at how cliché it was, and when she looked at him, he was already staring.

he looked away quickly, letting out a soft laugh as well, like he hadn’t meant to get caught.

she felt something spark — subtle, but unmistakable.

the light turned green. the moment dissolved. they walked on.

inside mcdonald’s, he insisted on ordering. she was ready to order at the kiosk for him but he nudged her to the side, insisted on doing so for her.

“what do you want?”

“just coffee.”

“no. absolutely not. eat something.”

“…fries, then.”

their friends got their food first and drifted outside, leaving the two of them in the quiet hum of fluorescent lights.

outside, he glanced at her fries with the longing of someone witnessing a miracle.

“those look so good.”

“here,” she said, noticing his hands were full. she lifted a fry to his lips. he leaned forward without hesitation.

“god, that’s so good.”

“everything tastes better when you’re drunk,” she said, feeding him another.

maybe that sparked some sense of reciprocity, because he immediately unwrapped his burger and held it in front of her mouth.

“eat,” he said.

“i’m fine.”

“eat.”

there was no winning. she leaned in, taking a bite — and he watched her like the moment mattered, like the night was cataloguing itself through these small, ridiculous gestures.

one bite turned into two. then three. until they were practically swapping meals without either of them declaring it.

they kept feeding each other as they walked back, sharing fries, sharing bites of a burger, sharing laughter that spilled too easily.

by the time they reached the hotel, their hands had somehow found each other again. maybe for balance. maybe not.

their rooms were across from each other, but she still made sure he reached his door safely. he hugged her — a little longer than necessary, a little quieter than expected.

she smiled against his shoulder and hoped the night wouldn’t vanish from his memory by morning.

weeks and miles apart later, she still replayed the memory the way some people hold onto songs long after the radio goes silent.

lauv’s “i like me better” became an unintentional reminder — looped, repeated, carried with her through commutes and quiet evenings.

she waited for him to reach out. he didn’t.

still, whenever the song appeared by accident, she felt something flicker back to life.

the spark had been real. she wasn’t imagining that.

whether it had been real to him… she didn’t know. but she held onto the quiet belief that the universe had a way of circling people back when the timing softened.

as she wrote in the note she had slipped under his door that drunken night, without knowing if he noticed or not:

see you around.

and somehow, she still meant it.",1,1764138670.0,u_gongjuniiim,0,1.0,False
1p70guz,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaydating/comments/1p70guz/relationships_are_dead_please_send_help_m21_nj/,"Relationships are dead, please send help. M21 NJ.","Hi M21 here, I recently ranted to my friend about this and thought it was something I should come and talk about here. 

I recently found that dating right now actually sucks. I genuinely feel like people are social with every other person but me. I actually think something is wrong because I went to a coffee shop earlier this week and caught this guy looking at me a few times and I genuinely thought he would have made a move because I cannot bring myself to approach someone (part of this issue is you can’t tell these days who’s straight or gay, like it’s insane.) Anyways, after him smiling at me I smiled back. A few minutes go by and he gets up and goes to up to another guy and starts flirting then eventually talking to him and he gets his info. With that, I genuinely was so confused and my confidence dropped. How is it that people go up to others and initiate conversation, but with me it has never happened. I don’t think I’ve once been approached by a guy and asked out. 

Another example of this was when I went out to NYC for my friends birthday and made eye contact a few times with this guy who definitely looked more masculine than me, and after some time instead of going up to me and asking me to dance he just asks someone else…

Moving on, I think the issue is that I don’t make the first move, but I feel like it brings my confidence down so fast. Not to repeat myself but it’s just frustrating to know that these guys are outgoing and confident to talk to others but don’t have the ability to come up to me. 

Anyways, this was mainly a rant but also a cry for help/advice. Lmk if I’m just being crazy tho. ",3,1764138090.0,gaydating,1,1.0,False

Offers are always welcome, I’ve lucked into some stuff that I really love that I wasn’t necessarily looking for, worst I can do is say no thanks. I do also have a post on r/ G4S, though it would be nice to get my boards finished.  

#**WTT:**

#**Normal stuff:**

- Chase Bliss Tonal Recall RKM, w/wood box 
- Chase Bliss Mood, w/wood box
- Chase Bliss Billy Strings Wombtone, w/box
- Alexander Pedals History Lesson V3, w/box
- Coppersound Gravity Bomb, w/box

###**Couple of oddballs:**

- Boss ME-X. This one is a big boi, a multi-effect and loop switcher built into a pedalboard case/combo. Has laughable pitch shifting, but decent reverb and modulation, and excellent delay
- Oneder Wet Hot American Bummer, w/box, please for the love of all things good in this world don’t trade for this unless you’re gonna refinish it or otherwise remove the artwork for Oneder (Nick Diener recently got outed as a serial groomer 🤮). I just didn’t love the sound as much as I thought I would, hopefully someone else will love the circuit and refinish it. 


#**WTTF:**

###**First the utility stuff.** If the total values match we can definitely talk bundle deals; these are all things I *need* for my boards, the more I can check off my list the better:

- Cioks 4, or Walrus Canvas 5, 8, or 15 as long as they have the external power brick. Could also do a Cioks DC7, or maybe a Sol, but I’d prefer the 4. 
- Sonic Research ST-300 Mini or Strobostomp Mini; I need two total so one of each or two of either works for me.
- A Morningstar ML5R, Oscillator Devices HYDRA, or other similarly compact 3-5 reorderable MIDI loop switcher. Could also do a Disaster Area DPC.micro (bonus points if it’s the one with no footswitches), or if there’s another Boss compact pedal-size MIDI 3-loop switcher out there I’m all ears.
- I’d definitely consider a Jet Pedals Unity 6, not sure I want to move on from Morningstar but that might cover everything in need in a small box.

###**Sound-changing pedals:**

- Tone King Imperial Preamp
- Coffee Pedals London Fog Delay
- Boss XS-1 or XS-100
- Would probably say yes to an 80Tape In Limbo V, IV, or III
- Also would consider a Jam Pedals Delay Llama Xtreme or Beetronics BeeBeeDee. If you know of other analog delay pedals with pitch shifting/sequencing I’m very interested. And even though it’s not analog I’d be down for a Polarbear Effects Petrichor, hits the same vibe.

###**Two unlikely things:**

- This one is gonna be highly unlikely, but a pedalboard/case combo with outer dimensions of 21.5x13.5x9 or just slightly less (fits carryon dimensions of all but three of the most popular airlines in the EU and NA), with two full levels that can fit standard size pedals anywhere on each level. Realistically I’m mostly looking for pedalboard builder recommendations, but if you somehow miraculously have a board that fits those specs you’ll get priority over everyone else. 
- And this is definitely a ***very*** long shot because it would need someone to be into most or all of my pedals for their one thing, but an iPad Pro or MacBook with M3 or later chip and 16GB RAM is something I could definitely use.

1p70gj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1p70gj6/should_i_leave_my_bf/,Should I leave my bf ?,"Hi Ok fam buckle up bc this is gonna be looong and sorry for the grammar mistakes im Ranting lol ! I need some advice on what to do With my situation. So me (23f) have been with my boyfriend Sam (22m) got together when we were 18/19, and I feel like from the start I should have left but couldn’t get myself too. For some context I was abandoned by my parents when I was just 14 so when people come into my life I normally cling onto them scared they are going to leave ( I am working on this, I just currently can’t afford therapy you’ll eventually know why from my story. ), so about about a month into our relationship he asked me to text his brother for him off his phone while he was playing some game   On his Xbox, as I was writing the text out he got an emailed receipt from only fans about his subscriptions, I know it was snoopy of me but I clicked on on the notification and saw he had just spent 60 dollars on varies girls, and he had asked to borrow 60 dollars the day before so Ik he used my OWN money to pay to look at other girls, which broke me very deeply because I made it very clear porn and being lustful for others was against my boundaries  I confronted him immediately and started crying and he said he was sorry and started doting all over me saying he’s never felt this way about a girl before and he would never do it again and was extra lovey for the next couple days. fast forward 6 months later, i wanted to find a link he used to watch free movies because I forgot what it was called and his browser is filled with pornhub, he was watching it multiple times a day even on nights he was at my house when I was either sleeping or at work. when I confronted him he told me he loves me and thinks I’m the most beautiful girl in the world but he has an addiction, so I tried being the most understanding as I could and decided we could work on it together. We had put parental locks on his phone that blocked out all spicy adult websites or images. then one year into our relationship, he gave me his Snapchat login because he worked nights and slept in the day and he didn’t want us to loose our streak bc he wanted to keep the count of days we have talked since we met. so one night it was 3am when I’m normally asleep I saw our streak was about to go out and he wasn’t answering me on messages so I logged in to his snap to find him planing to meet up with a girl he just met on the app THAT VERY NIGHT !!!! at first he was like “I have a gf” but after the girl said she didn’t care and he couldn’t be to happy bc he responded to her, he proceeded to complain about me and agreed to come over after work, driving in the car I bought and was letting him use because he didn’t have one ! When he was supposed to be coming over to my house. I logged him out when I logged in so he knew I was seeing it he kept logging back in and kicking me out. I proceeded to text the girl that it was his girlfriend and I said getting with a man with girl is down right disgusting and blocked her. he then kicked me off his account unblock her and tell her sorry about that, I texted him it was over and to bring my car back in the morning and find a way home. he ended up blocking Her after that and deleting Snapchat in total. after that I woke up to him in my house with plush animals and coffee trying to hug me saying he is so sorry that it was a mistake and he didn’t actually do it and proceeded to be lovey dovey for the next couple days again, I tried to distant myself for awhile because I felt it would help me get the courage to leave……but then those 2 blue lines showed up, so I decided to stay and try to work on things. ( let’s just fast forward because I feel  like this is getting a little long, he never stopped looking at thirst traps on apps or watching porn for another almost 2 years we eventually solved this issue even though it took 2 years to long ) but anyways the day after I gave birth I came home to my mother in law moving all my stuff out of my house into a moving truck (which I later found out they used my card and somehow all 3000 in my account was gone) saying we’re going to be moving in with them for the baby and I was so exhausted from just having a baby and very rough pregnancy with my son (kam) that I decided to leave with kam and go to a my friends (Jessie)  for the day bc I just wanted to relax. I didn’t want to go bc it meant giving up my job that I loved so much, and my house which I’ve lived in since I was 19 and already made my sons nursery in but my say didn’t matter Sam came and picked me up and drove me to my new “home”  and immediately they started making me do all the house chores and if I didn’t I was berated and yelled in my face right next to my newborn so I eventually gave in and did all the chores, cleaning,  cooking, and laundry for a family of 13 with a newborn wrapped across my chest about 6 weeks in I was so exhausted I decided not to do any chores that day, and his brother who is much much larger than me came into my room while I was mid changing my sons diaper and get right up in my and telling me “ to get my disgusting ass in the kitchen” and that I do nothing I put my arm out to keep him out of my face and he picked me up and threw me into the tv my bf and him then fought and I started packing that very second and i called my bf grandpa and he immediately sent me the money to leave, and I will always will be thankful for that. while I was packing his father and mother came into yelling at me and then  dad proceeded to hold me down while his mother beat me up while I couldn’t move the police came they were charged not arrested, but the whole time it was happening it felt like slow nation I was calling for Sam to help me but he just stood there. then he always said he was calling the cops ( he didn’t I did ) and that his dad is bigger and wouldn’t of took him down. he ended up coming with me when i left and went no contact with them, we ended up moving into a friends (Jessie again)  because they worked a job they had to leave alot, but I was the only one who take care of our son the only one who cleaned, all he did was game and sleep and eat when he was home once in a while if I asked he would change a diaper but it have to be on his time not the baby’s. and he wouldn’t let me work bc I needed to take care of my son but won’t  give me money to buy the things i need . and he wouldn’t change his hours at work so I could. he eventually found a place of our own, but it only has one room where the floor is finished and safe and it is mice and bug infested and he won’t help keep it clean or by the things you need to get rid of them. so now I’m with a toddler in a house that we’re confined to one room and if I wanna cook clean or do anything outside of the one room I have to hold a toddler the entire time, now this is where my “last straw “ comes in tonight I was trying to make dinner and he decided to go to bed at 5pm. so I was holding my toddler and was cooking and I ended up spilling boiling water all over my arm i came in there still holding my son saying I burnt myself real bad and he got up handed me a wet rag . then I started to get upset and say this would of never happened if u actually made this place safe enough to put our son down outside the room  he told me hes tired of my bitching when he helped right away and is doing what I want. and went back to bed for me to deal with the burn and a cranky teething toddler who was grabbing at my burn.  I forgot to renew my license when I moved states  and  few to many unpaid tickets (bc i have no income) , I lost it and so can’t drive, and when i suggested I get a new id bc mine was expired  coincidently my wallet was stolen out of the car in the drive with my social and my sons and my forms of identification in it, I had the neighbor check their camera that shows out drive and no one came on the footage so I don’t know what happened there  but he refuses to take me to the social office to replace them bc he “doesn’t have the time” or “has no gas”.  I don’t know to many people in this state since I moved here at 19 and got with him a few months later I didn’t get the chance to make many friends and my friend Jessie moved states for work and also lost most of the ones I did had when I got pregnant bc I couldn’t “have fun” anymore   . so now it’s just me all alone with my son all the time confined to a room and I don’t know what to do, I felt tonight really showed he doesn’t care about me or my well being, but now that I sit here and type this all out and truly think about it I don’t think he ever really did, I am just scared of being alone i guess… should I leave ? I’d have to go to a shelter bc I have no friends or family in this state (no way he let me leave the state with our son ) and that scares me bc he always threatens that he take full custody of our son if I go bc I have no money no license and no home of my own. What should I do if I leave ??? ",3,1764138059.0,okstorytime,2,1.0,False
