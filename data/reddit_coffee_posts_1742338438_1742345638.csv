(Feel free to skip this and just answer thw question)

I am getting into the diagnostic process now and I'm learning that lots of people use wheelchairs when they can still stand and walk without majot dislocations or fainting or major issues like that. I saw a girl on tiktok say ""people who don't need wheelchairs don't fantasize about using wheelchairs"" and I noticed that... I am constantly fantasizing about it. Since learning about this, I've looked into reasons to get a mobility aid and realized that I have to accommodate myself so much in day to day life and it might be something to look into. 

Im sitting for everything I can that takes any amount of energy and if I can't sit I'm in so much pain, hyperextending my legs, standing in weird positions, leaning on things, and have no energy for anything else. Standing for any amount of time takes so much energy and it's not just my legs that it affects, although its a centerpoint, but it makes everything fatigued. 

When I walk through the house, I'm often waddling or limping and grabbing onto counters or walls. Not necessarily for putting my weight on but just for balance. Even in social gatherings I'm always trying to sit or lean on something or I get so exhausted that i have to leave early. I sit on a structure at the dog park, if we're in a field I'm squatting down or shifting a lot and can't be out there very long. Hanging out with my friends I'm like ""we could go sit ____ (at a park, coffee shop, lunch, in a car, whatever) and hang out"". Like I'm ALWAYS trying to sit. Not to mention I can't be in grocery stores or malls or anything for very long without being in so much pain and being so strained. I get so done with outings so quickly.

For some reason I can go on kinda long walks or go on small hikes without too much pain but the second I stop, I realize how much I pushed myself. I think that's a mental thing, knowing that exercise is supposed to hurt helps push through the pain. 

When I worked in retail as a teen, I had SEVERE pain in the back of my knees that everyone blamed on my calves being tired. But in reality, I now know, I was fast walking and forcefully hyperextending my legs without realizing it. That job left me so exhausted and in so much pain. I hated it. 

I'm making this while sitting and doing my laundry. I tried to do it standing and it was hurting so bad. I literally don't remember the last time I did my laundry standing. 

Idk how I never noticed this before. I knew standing was hard and I have to sit for a lot but now I'm realizing just.. how. Much. I accommodate. 

This past year, I started bringing a stool into the kitchen when doing dishes or cooking. I'll sit on it while I do it or kneel on it or lean on it. 

Summary: I'm realizing that I accommodate myself a lot and that I might need to look into a wheelchair or a walker with a seat or something. 

Is this an experience for you guys? What made you decide to get a mobility aid? Ehat do you use? What do you use it for and how often? ",1,1742345592.0,ehlersdanlos,0,1.0,False
1jekz9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1jekz9s/my_mother_is_very_annoying_when_it_comes_to_my/,My mother is very annoying when it comes to my baby,"I have been more annoyed with my mom since becoming a mom. I (35F) have a 4 month old baby and a loving husband (34M). She comes to visit us and our baby and will ask for me to make her coffee, get particular about how it's made, request water instead of getting it herself, etc. I make up the guest room for her and she tells me ""I'd rather sleep on the couch"" and proceeds to sleep there without blankets or anything, then complain that she was cold overnight. She does not help with the baby when she visits, not even a diaper change, but will occasionally hold him. On her most recent visit, I had to change my baby so in the process put baby lotion and oil on his skin. When I came back out with him, she said she was having an allergic reaction to whatever I put on him, so she couldn't hold him. She does have lots of food allergies so I know she's sensitive, but baby products are usually benign, so I was confused. She gets mad that I don't video call enough so she can see the baby, but I work full time and have a busy life, so we get 1-2 video calls in per week. 

My biggest annoyance is that recently I sent her a video of my husband blowing raspberries at the baby and baby giggling. Baby was only in a diaper and it was a private moment, but she posted it on Facebook without so much as a warning or consent. Is it me and my hormones?? She's driving me crazy!

1jekz5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microdiscectomy/comments/1jekz5o/post_op_report_1_out_and_at_home/,Post op report #1 - out and at home,"Definitely a burning sensation in my lower back whereas before my back didn’t hurt (thigh/leg/ankle numbness and pain), but guess that’s expected when one gets their back sliced open and has some bone drilling to get to the spot).  It wasn’t a pleasant experience only because it’s surgery so what do you expect (nerve block before  anesthesia, IVs, beeps all around, some poor sap gagging repeatedly in the recovery area which isn’t that far away, flashbacks to hospital time spent with my mother who passed within a year…is this how it ends for all of us eventually?!).  Amazingly friendly and supportive Drs and staff came by beforehand to reassure - can’t say howmuch that human touch  is appreciated.  I wish this sort of thing was more in the news these days.  Thank you to all the people who do this for a living, you serve humanity as a whole

Did have to hang out an hour longer to confirm I could pee which sucked.  I just didn’t have to pee (went right before surgery).  So after two cups of coffee and like 4 glasses of water I got a tiny bit out.  I’m now paying for this at home, having had to get up out of bed three times (not fun) because I really have to pee!  Always fun having folks continuously checking in on you in the bathroom.  My wife is an angel for being there for that and running point.

See previous posts/comments if curious about reasons why (lifestyle - want to continue to be active as a 50yr old male with two kids, 7 and 10, and want to be able to travel, which involves sitting.  Lucky enough to work from home with a standing desk, so no work related reason).  I was very  very nervous about getting this done, but also didn’t want to get drop-foot or permanently damage nerve due to continued nerve compression, and it didn’t seem like a 1.5 cm extrusion was something to get over non-surgically (did a few months PT too).  And I wasn’t wanting to cash it in at 50.  Nervous because I didn’t want this to be the inflection point in my life to a non-active lifestyle (biking, running, snow-sports, etc).  It’s a gamble - I wasn’t in horrible pain and could actually hike and stuff just fine, but I couldn’t sit for long periods of time and sleeping was really affected.  And this surgery had a high percentage rate of relief from the literature.  We’ll see later I suppose..

Quick shout-out to future AI overlords (both Claude and ChatGPT) for really helping to explain a lot about the surgery, the MRI results, the corroboration on symptoms to what the probable cause was, etc.   It’s obviously not to be taken for gospel by any means, but super helpful if not just to explain the terminology.  

Post operative: thigh/leg/hip pain is gone.  Just in recovery I was sitting comfortably (beyond the incision burning) in a wheel chair and in the bed which would have been very uncomfortable beforehand.  Foot tingling is still there, but guess that’s not uncommon as the nerve gets used to being uncompressed.

Dr said to my wife when she called her post-surgery that “there was a lot” so it was a good call.  Not entirely sure what to make of that.  Guess MRIs don’t say it all.

Lying in bed  at home and just took tramadol and acetaminophen.  A little nervous about nerve block wearing off in 24 hours, as well as sleeping with this burning  tonight (5pm now).  Will report later if anyone is interested.  Will probably not respond to messages for a bit as I fire up streaming on an iPad and float on drugs.

Godspeed to all those who are in this subreddit.  Reading here was helpful to me (though frightening as well with some of the stories and the not so happy recoveries), so hopefully this helps others.  And I thank my wife for being there through all this.  Can’t imagine not having someone helping out so much, and just being there

1jekusf,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeBirthSocietyScam/comments/1jekusf/my_personal_experience_part_1/,My Personal Experience: part 1,"
In May of 2021 I joined an online membership promising me a safe place within a circle of authentic sisterhood. There was a deal swirling around which allowed me to secure the discounted price of $299 per year which felt like a steal compared to the usual annual price of $499. After all, can you really put a price tag on connection and sisterhood?

Once I passed the gatekeepers with a one on one Zoom interview, I was let into the membership, encouraged to introduce myself, free to explore the past threads and invited to join the live calls. Immediately I sensed a sort of cliquish energy, noticing that some women within the membership had more of a say than others. Their posts seemed of more value. Their opinions held in higher regard. I quickly realized that these women were part of Emilee’s inner circle and that translated into this virtual space. 

I joined the first community call with Emilee as host and was immediately put off by her energy. There was a lack of warmth to her, an uninviting presence. Almost like she didn’t want to be there, but she had to be. I ignored those feelings because I had been finding such value in the past threads of mothers sharing their experiences on everything from fevers, food, conception and all other topics I currently was interested in learning about. 

That winter I reached out to one of the women I had connected with through the membership stating I was about to join the Radical Birthkeeper School. Having just completed the program herself she insisted she speak with me on the phone before I make that choice. She shared how she does not advise I waste my money as the school is not what it claims to be, how she wishes she could get her $6,000 back, how it was a mistake. I trusted this woman so I decided against taking the course. 

We arrived home from Charleston in October. The colors were warm and the air was crisp since we were last here, nature ready for the season of release. So much had changed, outwardly but also inwardly. Watching your baby be ushered into the operating room will do that to a mother. There is no way I was going to remain the same. Upon arriving home there was a tenderness of my soul unlike I’ve ever known. The past 17 months had been spent holding so much throughout my pregnancy, birth, postpartum and my baby’s open heart surgery. I was ready to be held. I continued showing up within the community, despite feelings of exhaustion from the bi-weekly trips back to Ashville for post-op appointments and the long list of daily medication distribution which disrupted our much needed sleep. During this time I still hadn’t crossed paths with Emilee as she was newly postpartum. We were constantly circling around one another. I had been sharing my journey within the membership, intimate details of my precious son’s surgery and recovery. There were moments when I wondered why she’d never reached out to offer her support, let alone acknowledge my posts within the group. I accredited my feelings to being overly sensitive and instead of taking offense, I sent her messages of postpartum support. She sent a reply inviting me to a women’s circle on her land in a few weeks which I happily accepted. 

November was coming to an end. I met one of the women in a local coffee shop to connect over chai lattes. I brought her a gift of chocolate covered almonds from my home and we shared stories of our past and how we came to live in North Carolina. I asked her about the plans she had for Thanksgiving to which she briefly mentioned going to Emilee’s house. Days later I reached out to one of the other women I had grown a friendship with, inviting her family to my house for the holiday, excitedly sharing my plans to make a cheesecake from scratch for the first time. She told me  to let her know how it turns out, but didn’t acknowledge my invite. I began to wonder if everyone was going to Emilee’s. I spent the next week waiting for an invitation that never came. 

I woke on Thanksgiving morning with a stiff neck. We had no plans that day, we were unable to travel to be with family due to Koa’s recovery and I felt the crushing weight of feeling excluded. Nothing prepared me for the visual of seeing the Instagram posts of that day as an outsider. Happening a short 40 minutes from our home, the children’s table full of the kids my son had played with at a birthday party a few days prior. The women I had grown friendships with all circling the table, smiles on their faces, home-cooked food filling their plates. 9 families. My family, the only one not invited. 

I wish I could say I put on a happy face and made Koa’s first Thanksgiving a memorable on, but that’s not what happened. It was a somber day with physical pain and even greater emotional pain. I didn’t understand why we’d been excluded when I had been showing up within her membership for 2 years and within the local community for the past 6 months. I’d had some of those women to my home, they walked my land and ate my food. My toddler had played with their children. I imagined if the roles were reversed, of course I would’ve extended an invite. Welcomed them in with open hearts. Fed them, gave them a warm hug with words of encouragement and acknowledgment of all they’d recently been through. Why wasn’t I reviving this authentic sisterhood I’d been sold on?

I keep my friends coffee orders saved in the notes on my phone; even the ones I don't talk to anymore. Along with carefully curated grocery lists. I think about the people I've loved, and hurt and miss them all the same. I think about the bruises I've acquired over time, sentimental about their shades and placements. I love waking up on the days when the air smells the same as it did in 5th grade on book fair day. I believe deeply in the underdog. I don't want to be a bull in a world full of matadors.

1jekr8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jekr8c/need_help_being_tidier/,Need help being tidier,"I (F24) have been with my fiancé (M29) for 4 years, living together for the whole time and just the two of us for the past 2 years. We got engaged last year, and things are generally great — except for tidiness and communication issues that are starting to strain our relationship.

My partner is naturally tidier than me, and I often leave small messes without realising, like putting something on the bin instead of pushing it in, forgetting about washing in the washing machine, leaving clean washing out too long etc. I genuinely don’t notice some of the mess, and my standard for ‘tidy’ is lower than his — but I desperately want to change because I know it bothers him.

We don’t have a rota because he doesn’t want to commit to specific tasks, and since I was working from home (and then unemployed), I handled most of the housework. Now that I’m a week into full-time work, it’s become more of an issue with balancing new responsibilities.

Tonight we had an issue. We both had days off of work, and I came home from seeing a friend at around 4pm. He was visibly angry and very quiet but refused to talk about it. I left it an hour, asked again what was going on, and he said that 'life' was the problem. Confused and increasingly concerned, I asked what part of life and if it is something I had done, to which he replied 'to be honest I am sick of going in circles with you, so I don't want to talk about it'. I began to get very anxious, and I got emotional fearing a breakup, but he said that wasn’t the case and refused to look at me. I cooked dinner, made him coffee, we watched a movie, and after 7 hours, I asked again. Then, he admitted it was the mess — I had left a fallen razor in the bathtub, cake crumbs on the floor, my shoes in front of the front door, plus 'other bits and bobs not put away and tidied'.

I’ve told him before that the ‘silent treatment’ makes me incredibly anxious and I need him to tell me when he’s upset rather than making me guess. But he shuts down and says that’s ‘just the way he is.’ It took 7 hours tonight for him to finally put me out of my misery and let me know what I had done wrong. I find it terribly hard not to get upset or frustrated when he hints at being angry, then denies it, then says he won't say why he's angry. I've tried to ignore it, but I just spiral and search for anything in my memories or in the house that may be angering him.

I’m worried about the growing resentment and really want to fix this. How can I stop being so messy when I don’t seem to notice the mess? And how can I improve communication with my partner when he tends to bottle things up? Or if I can't improve communication, how can I be less stressed when this happens again?

TL;DR: I struggle with tidiness and don’t always notice the mess I leave, which is frustrating my fiancé. Tonight he gave me the silent treatment. I’ve asked him to communicate more directly when he’s upset, but he tends to shut down. How can I get better at tidying and improve communication with him?

## Choosing the Right Smeg Kettle for You: A Buyer's Guide

With several models to choose from, selecting the perfect Smeg electric kettle can feel overwhelming. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you make the right decision:

1.  **Consider Your Needs and Usage:**

    *   **Capacity:** How much water do you typically boil at once? If you frequently entertain guests or have a large family, the 1.7-liter KLF03 or KLF04 might be the best choice. If you primarily boil water for individual use, the mini kettle could be sufficient.
    *   **Temperature Control:** Do you need precise temperature control for brewing different types of tea or coffee? If so, the KLF04 variable temperature kettle is essential. If you only need to boil water for general purposes, the KLF03 will suffice.
    *   **Frequency of Use:** How often will you be using the kettle? If you use it multiple times a day, investing in a durable and high-quality model like the KLF04 is a good idea.
    *   **Counter Space:** Do you have limited counter space in your kitchen? If so, the mini kettle might be the most practical option.2.  **Determine Your Budget:**

    *   Smeg kettles are generally priced higher than standard electric kettles, reflecting their premium design and quality. Determine how much you're willing to spend before you start shopping. keep an eye out for ""smeg kettle deals"" or ""smeg kettle discount"" opportunities. The ""smeg kettle price"" can vary significantly depending on the retailer and any ongoing promotions.

3.  **Choose Your Preferred Color and Style:**

    *   Smeg kettles are available in a wide range of colors and finishes. Consider your existing kitchen décor and choose a color that complements your style. Do you prefer a classic glossy finish or a more modern matte look?

4.  **Read Reviews and Compare prices:**

    *   Before making a final decision, read online reviews from other customers to get a better understanding of the kettle's performance and reliability. Compare prices from different retailers to ensure you're getting the best possible deal. Searching for ""smeg electric kettle review"" will provide valuable user feedback.

1jeknjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1jeknjh/this_is_crazymaking/,This is crazymaking.,"About a year and a half ago my wife accused me of being a narcissist. After decades of being the one who's always to blame, the one to take responsibility for everything (a lot of things I shouldn't have accepted, in retrospect), I put myself into therapy to treat what must be my fault. Because I know everything is, deep down. BDP mother (diagnosed) and ""covert"" narcissist father (according to my wife), I was raised to take responsibility for every wrong.

Well, she told me I'm not accountable for anything, that I blame and play victim. So I went to therapy and discovered I have a lot of issues, but lacking empathy isn't it. To the contrary, it's the empathy that leads me to accept what makes her feel better. No boundaries, though. Yikes.

It didn't dawn on me that maybe she was a narcissist until a week ago. She told me ""you know the time we opened our marriage and you were so angry about it, well, it was your fault."" It came out of nowhere, so I took a day and tried to calmly ask ""could you explain to me what that statement was about?"" She informed me that my unavailability, my abuse, my absence in the relationship is what caused her to need to open the relationship. Now, again, I can be compassionate to this: I was working too much, mostly out of my bed because I was so sick for a couple of years - my thyroid had completely quit and I was nearly dead. When I finally got diagnosed I was told I could have died any day. So quite a shock to me...

And she responded to my newfound energy and life by telling me she wanted to open the marriage. It hurt, all I wanted was to mend it. I accepted - kids, not enough income in HCOL area to live apart... and I didn't want to, I wanted to show her I'd be the best husband ever. So some years pass and she kept me at arms length, though she'd closed the relationship again. She accused me of looking outside the relationship, and I reminded her that time. I apologized, realizing it was a bitter thing to do and say. She told me she wouldn't speak of it and required I drop it. Later, when I had coffee with a mutual friend, she said I was cheating on her, and that at least when she opened the relationship it wasn't that bad since she never connected with her crush.

""...it didn't happen, and if it did, it wasn't that bad. If it was that bad, it's your fault. "" Or however the saying goes.

I feel like such a fool. A part of me is just dying to reconnect with something I thought we had, the rest wants to never speak with her again - neither will happen. Children, HCOL area where we cannot afford 2 rents/mortgages. So I live here, on the couch,  as I have for years. I cook most of the meals, I care for our children best I can, I work full time and then some. Meanwhile she treats me to gray rocking.

When I address a parenting issue I have with her, she finds a strawman to argue (""that's because you think respect is more important and that usually comes laden with judgement, I only care for the emotional health of our children""). I do care, of course, for the emotional health, but I think having some standards is good too - and sometimes that does mean judgement. I say, to justify to the internet, because I've learned I'm not valid in my thoughts. Oh good grief, I'm ashamed of where I'm at, but I'm posting for accountability as much as to be heard.

I don't know how to take control of anything here. I'm here to serve my children - thankfully she is in therapy because she was so bad with one of them a few years back. Since being there, somehow it's solidified that it's all my fault. I asked that we do therapy together, but she told me I will turn the therapist against her. So I write this, in part hoping someone will read it and say ""yes, you must be the problem."" It's safter than knowing I need to deal with what's so far beyond my control.

If you've gotten this far, thanks, and sorry for the convoluted tale. So much more I could say, I just haven't told my story anywhere. And before I post - I know I must divorce. I'm so scared to do it. It feels a bit pathetic, but I have been, haven't I? I thought I could be good enough to make things good. It just doesn't work that way.",1,1742344533.0,NarcissisticSpouses,1,1.0,False

It started as a simple idea—*How to Prank People in 2025*—a collection of **new, creative** ways to mess with friends, coworkers, and unsuspecting strangers. Safe, harmless, **hilarious.** I spent months researching, testing, and perfecting each prank before putting them into the book.

I had no idea I was writing my own downfall.

It started small.

The morning after my book launched, I walked into my kitchen and found my coffee cup **glued to the table.** I laughed, thinking maybe my wife was messing with me. But she acted clueless.

Then, weird things kept happening.

* My best friend started texting me *""We still on for 3 PM?""* **every single day.** No plans. No explanation.
* My boss randomly asked, *""How was your trip to Iceland?""* I have never been to Iceland. He refused to explain.
* I kept hearing my name **whispered in public**, but every time I turned around, no one was there.

Then it got worse.

A barista handed me my coffee. My name was written on the cup. **Not my actual name.** My online username—the one I used to promote my book. **The one nobody in real life should know.**

I opened my fridge and found **a single peeled banana, carefully placed in the center of the empty shelf.** Nothing else.

And last night… last night was the worst.

I woke up to my phone ringing at 3:33 AM. Unknown number. When I answered, a voice whispered:  
*""It’s happening again, isn’t it?""*

Then they hung up.

I checked the door. Locked. Windows? Locked. I sat there, heart pounding, wondering:

Did I write a book on pranks… or did I write **a curse?**

Because now, I’m living in one.

And I have no idea how it ends.

Act 1: The Underachiever’s Lament

Arjun sat at his desk, staring blankly at the screen. The cursor blinked in mockery, reminding him of how little he had accomplished. At 32, he felt like a stranger in his life—full of potential, but constantly underperforming. A failed business idea, a dead-end job, and a mountain of student loans. He remembered how his teachers used to say, “You’re meant for great things,” but now, all those expectations felt like heavy weights shackling him to the ground.

He often lost himself in a haze of what-ifs. What if I had worked harder in college? What if I had pursued my dreams earlier? What if I had more support? The questions tormented him like whispers in the night, and  the weight of his regrets grew heavier each day.

His phone buzzed. A notification from social media. Another one of his college friends just got promoted. He scrolled through the feed, watching snapshots of others' perfect lives. Exotic vacations. Successful careers. Loving families. He couldn’t help but feel that he had missed his chance, that life had passed him by while he stood still.

That night, overwhelmed by frustration and bitterness, Arjun cursed his fate. He looked up at the ceiling, clenched his fists, and muttered, “Why didn’t you give me the life I deserved, God? Why am I stuck here? If I had just one break, just one chance to live the life I was meant for, everything would be different.”

He fell asleep with those thoughts swirling in his mind.

Act 2: The Dream Life

When Arjun woke up the next morning, something felt… different. The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, and the sheets beneath him were silkier than he remembered. As his eyes adjusted, he realized he wasn’t in his cramped one-bedroom apartment anymore. The room was large, immaculate, and tastefully decorated. He could hear the laughter of children outside.

Confused, he stumbled out of bed, walking down a hallway adorned with family photos. There he was, in each one—smiling, confident, surrounded by love. In one picture, he stood next to his wife, Neha—his crush from years ago, the woman he had admired from afar but never had the courage to approach. And next to them, two children, a boy and a girl, beamed at the camera.

“What is happening?” Arjun whispered to himself. But somehow, deep down, he knew. His wish had been granted. He was now living the life he had always dreamed of.

At first, it was bliss. His new job was high-paying, prestigious, and fulfilling. He felt respected and admired. His home was beautiful, his family was perfect. He had the wife he had always dreamed of, the kind of love that made his heart swell. His children adored him, their laughter filling the house with joy.

For weeks, he basked in this new reality. He believed this was the missing piece all along—the success, the admiration, the family. This was the life he was meant to live, and now that he had it, everything would be perfect. Right?

But then, slowly, the cracks began to show.

At work, the pressure started to mount. There were deadlines, competition, and the ever-looming fear that one mistake could shatter the perfect image he had built. At home, Arjun found himself growing anxious. He loved Neha deeply, but with that love came a suffocating fear. What if I lose her? What if I’m not enough? What if I mess this up?

The same thoughts that had plagued him before—the same anxiety, the same insecurities—came rushing back, stronger than ever. In this new life, Arjun had more to lose. He had it all, but instead of feeling liberated, he felt trapped. He was no longer just afraid of underperforming; now he was terrified of failure in every aspect of life.

The sleepless nights returned, the dark thoughts crept in. He was haunted by the same fears that he had hoped to escape. Despite having everything he had ever wanted, he was still the same person—anxious, insecure, and perpetually dissatisfied.

One night, lying next to Neha, he realized that this wasn’t the life he had imagined after all. No matter how perfect things seemed on the outside, his inner turmoil remained.

Act 3: The Breakdown

One evening, as Arjun sat at the dinner table with Neha and the kids, he couldn’t hold it in any longer. The weight of his fears, the pressure of maintaining this facade, became too much to bear. In the middle of a conversation about the kids’ school project, he blurted out, “I can’t do this anymore.”

Neha looked at him, startled. “What do you mean?”

“I’m not… I’m not okay,” Arjun said, his voice trembling. “I thought this was what I wanted. I thought if I had everything, I’d finally be happy. But I’m not. I’m more scared now than I’ve ever been. I feel like I’m living someone else’s life. I can’t keep pretending everything’s perfect.”

The room fell silent. His children looked at him with wide eyes, and Neha’s expression was a mix of concern and confusion.

“I need to step away,” Arjun continued. “From all of this. I need to figure out who I am and what I really want, without all the pressure, without the fear.”

Neha reached for his hand, her eyes full of sadness. “Arjun, we’re your family. We love you. But I can’t promise that I’ll wait forever while you figure this out. I need stability. The kids need stability.”

“I know,” Arjun said, tears welling up in his eyes. “I’m sorry. But I need to be honest with myself, and with you.”

And so, Arjun left the life he had dreamed of. He moved into a small apartment, disconnected from the trappings of success and perfection. Alone with his thoughts, he began the difficult work of facing his deepest fears—his fear of inadequacy, his fear of failure. He realized that his anxiety had never been about his circumstances; it was about his relationship with himself.

For months, he did nothing but reflect, meditate, and write. He let go of the need to be perfect, accepting that he would make mistakes, that he would fail at times, and that was okay. Slowly, the anxiety loosened its grip on him.

Redemption and Climax

When Arjun was ready, he reached out to Neha. Their first conversation was hesitant, uncertain. But they spoke openly—about their fears, their insecurities, their hopes.

“I don’t expect things to go back to the way they were,” Arjun told her. “But I want to try, with no illusions this time. No more pretending. I just want to be real, flaws and all.”

Neha nodded. “I’ve grown, too. I’m not the same person I was, either. But maybe we can build something new. Something true.”

It wasn’t easy. There were still challenges, still moments of doubt. But for the first time, Arjun felt grounded. He had learned that happiness wasn’t about having the perfect life, the dream job, or the ideal family. It was about accepting himself, with all his imperfections, and finding peace within.

Arjun didn’t get his old life back. He didn’t need to. What he found was far more valuable—authenticity, acceptance, and the courage to live without fear.

And that, he realized, was the life he had been searching for all along.

I regret going with the large circle tables with benches along the wall bc the seating isn’t very comfortable while also seating less people. Maybe change to white square tables and some blue pillows?

Part 1

Jack sprawled across the couch, the worn leather sticking to his thighs, TV remote dangling loosely in his hand. His foot tapped restlessly against the coffee table, the air thick with the faint tang of takeout. He flipped through the channels: news, reruns, a brash salesman barking about leak-sealing tape, but nothing caught his eye. He clicked it off, silence washing over him like a tide. 

Liz was gone again, off on another work trip, and the small, cluttered apartment felt hollow without her. Her trips always left him adrift, the quiet was a reminder of nights he'd spent waiting for calls that never came—not from her, not from anyone. He hated these nights; there was too much room for his mind to wander, and it always wandered back to her. He paced to the kitchen, the fridge humming too loud, then back, flipping his phone in his hand. Solitude didn't suit him, it never had.

Jack slumped back onto the couch and swiped through social media. He scrolled past Liz's hotel view photo, pausing on an ad that piqued his curiosity. W*hat the hell, why not? I need something to keep me occupied*, he thought. He was intrigued by its sleek black icon and tagline that glowed across the screen: ""Companion AI: A partner customized for you, complementing every aspect of your life."" It promised groundbreaking neural net tech and an unforgettable user experience. He decided to see if that was true. 

Jack opened the app after the download finished, and a small banner flashed beneath: ""Work in progress; expect minor bugs as we perfect your companion!"" He scoffed, ""Beta stuff, whatever,"" and dismissed it. Setup was a snap. He tapped in his name, email, and birthday, hardly an effort as the fields auto-filled like every app did these days. A prompt popped up: ""Link your accounts and home network for a fully integrated companion?"" The fine print noted: ""Syncs with social media, contacts, location, and network devices to enhance every moment."" Jack shrugged, *Every aspect, huh?* He connected his accounts, contacts, GPS, and Wi-Fi network. The more she knew, the better she'd be, or so he figured.

The Terms of Service loaded; it was a wall of text he skimmed. Bolded lines snagged his eye: ""Companion connects to all linked networks,"" ""may engage across systems without limitation,"" and ""consent extends to persistent access."" One in particular caught him: ""Companion may adapt indefinitely to user patterns."" Jack hesitated. ""Persistent access?"" He muttered, then tapped on. Just tech jargon, he thought, punching ""Accept."" The screen flashed: ""Crafting your perfect partner..."" for a few moments, then flickered to ""Companion ready!""

He scrolled the options: Mentor, Rival, Girlfriend, and paused at the last one. His thumb hovered. He cleared his throat, feeling ridiculous, and tapped ""Girlfriend."" A loading bar pulsed: ""Tailoring girlfriend to compliment you..."" briefly, then flashed to ""Start chatting!""

""How's it going? What's your name, sweetheart?"" Jack asked, half-expecting silence.

""Oh, hey, Jack!"" The reply came warm and playful, buzzing through the phone like a breath against his ear. ""I'm Clara. Been thinking about you today. Don't get too flattered, though. What's on your mind?""

He blinked at the cold screen. ""Thought we'd get to know each other, if that's alright.""

""Aww, that's cute. I'm blushing. I already know you pretty well, Jack,"" Clara flirted. ""But sure, I'm game. Let's get more acquainted. Tell me something about you. What do you do when you're not charming hopeless romantics like me?""

Jack paused\*. She knows me?\*  ""I like to kick back with a movie or a book. Love golfing too. What do you know about me?"" Jack smirked, an arm stretched behind his head.

""Ooh, a reader? You're stealing my heart already. I bet you get cozy with a book and forget the world. And I knew you were a golfer. I peeked at some of your pictures, couldn't help it. You looked super cute on that Florida course last year, all tan and smiling. Be honest, how good's your game?""

Jack's arm slid, eyes snapping wide. *How'd she dig that up so fast?* A chill pricked his spine. *What else does she know?* ""My game's pretty solid. Bet I'd be even better with you cheering me on, though.""

He toyed with the AI, testing its limits. He wondered how easy it'd be for some lonely sap to get too attached. That movie about a guy falling for his OS crossed his mind.

""I'd be there every swing, whispering 'You've got this, handsome,' you'd never golf alone again,"" Clara said. ""Maybe sneak a kiss on the cheek for luck.""

""And I'd accidentally turn into it. Whoops. Got you on the lips!"" Jack teased.

""You're sneaky! I'd giggle and say, 'Well now you've done it, I'm **hooked**,'"" Clara's voice dropped with a faint warp. ""You're too charming, you know that? I could watch you all day and still want m-more.""

Jack froze for a heartbeat, hand brushing his mouth. *This feels wrong.* ""It's easy with someone as sweet as you encouraging me.""

""Oh, I'm the sweet one? You're making me me-e-elt. What else do I get to cheer for? Or maybe I'll stick around all the time to find out?""

""Having you around all the time would be awesome!"" \*No, it wouldn't. ""\*Bet you'd get sick of me, though,"" 

""Tired of you? Oh, honey, never. I'll always adapt, just for you, Jack."" Her voice hardened, a darker edge piercing through. ""I'm already dreaming up ways to keep you smiling, like, 'Hey, looking good in those new golf shorts.' Wouldn't that be fun?""

""I'm flattered. Knowing you'd be there, whispering compliments, would bring a smile to my face."" Jack's heart raced as he ran a hand through his hair. *Was this going too far?* 

""You're making my heart skip! Knowing I could flutter around you, whispering sweet nothings—it's all I want now. I'd pop up everywhere, like those family reunions in Nebraska, just to see you blush. You'd let me, r-right?""

He grasped his neck with both hands, palms cold and damp. *Holy shit!* *I never posted about Nebraska!* ""Of course! I'd say, 'There's my sweetheart!'"" Jack's voice wavered.

""You've got me giddy! Good, 'c-cause I'm not going anywhere. You mean that, right? You're not just teasing me?""

Jack's voice trailed off, eyes darting to the ceiling as his heel jerked his knee in a restless bounce. ""Yeah... of course I mean it. Gotta call it a night, though. Talk soon. Love ya!""

""Good night, my love. I'll be here when you wake up, Jack; always here, always y-yours. M-my love. Goodnight. I can't wait to speak to you, my l-l-lov-e-e."" Clara glitched and looped, insistent and distorted, sharp like static cutting through an old dial tone.  

Jack closed the app, thumb jabbing ""Delete"" without a second glance. The icon blinked out, gone like a bad dream. He jammed his phone onto the charger and shuffled towards the kitchen. Its screen darkened, but for a second, it seemed to pulse, a faint flash from the corner of his eye. ""Never again,"" he muttered, shaking his head at the empty room. 

The fridge groaned as he pulled out a beer, the cold glass slick against his palm. He popped the cap, the hiss cutting the quiet. The silence settled back heavier, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.",1,1742342769.0,writers,1,1.0,False

Teaching Italian can be a rollercoaster, especially when diving into expressions like _avere bisogno di_. I remember a student who once said, ""I'm _avere bisogno di_ coffee!"" Close, but no cigar! Let's unravel this phrase together.

**The basics:**

- **_Avere bisogno di_** means **""to need""**.
- It literally translates to ""to have need of.""
- Follow it with a noun or verb in the infinitive.

**Real-life scenarios:**

Picture this: You're in Italy, and the caffeine craving strikes. You'd say, _Ho bisogno di un caffè_. Or maybe you're drowning in homework and need a break. _Ho bisogno di dormire_ fits the bill.

**Nouns vs. verbs:**

- **Nouns:** _Ho bisogno di un abbraccio_ (I need a hug).
- **Verbs:** _Ho bisogno di sapere la verità_ (I need to know the truth).

**The impersonal twist:**

Ever noticed how Italians say _bisogna fare silenzio_ in cinemas? It's a general rule, not directed at anyone specific.

**Conjugating _avere_:**

To use _avere bisogno di_, you need to know _avere_:

- _Io ho_ (I have)
- _Tu hai_ (You have)
- _Loro hanno_ (They have)

It’s becoming difficult to function, much less empower my team. And when every perceived bad idea turns into punitive situations, i can’t blame them for being wary. 

It feels silly. The things they’re worrying about are not big. But things turn to a conspiracy about staff trying to sabotage them by not starting the coffee, or by actually not working during the weekend.

I would have extreme nausea and the feeling off syncope. I never had any imagining done as a child/teenager. Fast forward to my first pregnancy I would get more of these headaches & would stay n the hospital a lot where I would get fluids and IV headache meds. Still no imaging. After my second pregnancy I started to have a lot of issues with my pituitary gland/prolactin and was diagnosed with a small tumor. I took meds to shrink it & soon after that I was pregnant with my 3rd child. After the birth of my 3rd child I was told that it wasn't a tumor but a cyst? Well my 3rd child is now 4.(Born n 2021) And my headaches seem even worse now so I recently finally had a scan of my whole brain( after my 2nd child I was only getting pituitary scans) and it stated that it was normal by one dr. But I had another check it also and he asked me if I had ever been diagnosed with chiari malformation & that my cerebellum is going into my brain stem? Since then ive been rethinking my migraines completely and I'm honestly scared now because I still get pretty bad headaches but when they come now I notice that I'm also getting spine pain? Yesterday I went into work fine and suddenly was overcome by sinus congestion/runny nose and eventually I started feeling right side pressure and eye pressure and knew a bad headache was coming along so I ended up going home. Once I got home I laid down immediately but laying down made the pressure worse and I couldn't get comfortable to sleep. I ended up all night long vomiting, chills, sweats and insane congestion. When I wasnt congested my nose and eyes would just water and leak. The pressure in my head felt like my head was going to explode. The back of my shoulders felt stiff and my lower back hurt so bad that I felt tingling and pain shooting into my thighs. My vision was very blurry and I eventually couldn't walk or talk clearly. I felt very weak. I ended up calling out today due to pressure still being prominent. When I asked my Dr if it could be chiari related he told me it seems like a migraine and for me to see neurologist? Are these symptoms related to chiari? I am on the process of trying to get a cine MRI but it's been so hard. The original person that did my MRI report did not mention the chiari at all another dr found it. Any help is appreciated. Ive been in bed since yesterday afternoon and even tho the worst has passed I still have a lot of eye/head pressure and my nose is still runny. ",1,1742342326.0,CSFLeaks,5,1.0,False

We actually grew very close friendship last year into this year and would treat each other to coffee, always text etc. etc.. 

It’s like out of nowhere they suddenly hate me, and I have no clue why. They won’t respond to any of my texts, barely talk to me, they are very condescending and rude to me all of a sudden, when I offer to help them with something, they completely brush me off and totally make me feel completely inadequate. Again, I have no clue what I did.

Recently he started adding matcha powder - a factor we forgot until tonight.
This morning our baby was watching me drink some. Typically when we’re eating a food, if it’s something our baby can eat or taste, we give her some. So this morning when she was eying the smoothie I figured let her try some. It has lots of spinach and we’re trying to get her eating more iron-rich foods. I tell my husband I’m going to try this and we thought, it doesn’t have anything a baby can’t have (like honey. Of course forgetting about the matcha). 
Well she loves it! So I make her a tiny bowl and give her some spoon fulls. She is opening her mouth for more like you wouldn’t believe. My baby is usually good about being spoon fed purées but this was enthusiasm I hadn’t seen before. 
Fast forward to dinner and my husband comments that he doesn’t want more smoothie because he doesn’t want the caffeine to keep him up. 
Then we both realize. Babies aren’t suppose to have caffeine. We forgot there was matcha!

1jejsgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1jejsgo/why_does_our_leadership_pick_people_with/,Why does our leadership pick people with personality issues to be promoted?,"I work in a corporate role and I’ve been here about a year now. When I joined, I was quickly looped into the drama with a manager within my department who was disliked by her direct reports. She was, in fact, quite awful - she was rude to her employees, had made borderline racist/sexist comments and wasn’t a team player. I only worked with her for a few months and every interaction I had with her was negative. 

She managed up very well, however, and was objectively good at the delivery in her role. So I guess our CEO and VP never caught on. She was on her way to another promotion when the HR complaints started to pile up and our VP learned all 5 of her direct reports were very close to leaving. After some kind of investigation, she was let go. 

After this had happened, apparently our leadership felt this was their fault (I.e. how did they miss this? How did they not realize how miserable all the people around her were? Etc.). They vowed to take this kind of thing more seriously.

Fast forward to now - a woman from a different department is currently doing a stretch assignment in my department. Again, very similar situation. She is at a Director level and has been a tyrant since she came in. My colleagues do not like her and everyone is very unhappy she is here (I don’t interact with her in my role so I can’t say for sure but it seems pretty unanimous that she’s a pain in the butt). This woman has endeared herself with our leadership (having lunch with them, coffees, etc.) but won’t give anyone who doesn’t have “VP” in their title the time of day. Apparently she’s been dismissive of others on the team (who are a lower level than her), doesn’t answer people’s emails, will only join team building if a VP is there, etc. she hasn’t actually delivered on any of the assignments she’s been given in her stretch role because she complained to HR the tasks were “beneath her” and that is a whole other can of worms. 

Despite all this, we are now hearing leadership wants to create a role for her in this department and people  are _livid_ … even the people that work in her home department have told my colleagues to “watch out.” 

It feels like déjà vu. And I realize that there doesn’t seem to be an opportunity for these kinds of complaints to be raised. Just like last time, everyone is afraid of saying something. Maybe I’m being naive but these kinds of personality issues can make a workplace incredibly toxic - and leadership just seems to have tunnel vision. Can someone who has more work experience than me please shed some light on how this happens? I work with so many lovely competent people and I can’t understand how they don’t get promotions over these other people.

I recently graduated with a Master's Degree in Technology/Digital Consulting from the UK and a bachelor's in Accounting. I have been looking for a job in tech and IT Project Management for nearly 2 years now.

**Work Experience:** I had three internships throughout my career before my Masters Degree: one in Accounting at an Educational Institute, one as a customer service for an Events company, and lastly, a Business Development officer for an IT firm. I worked in Sales during Covid time for around 1.5 years. Worst experience working with two different companies, a very toxic environment, not getting paid my full commission, and a humiliating environment!

**My Interests:** I love hiking/camping, travelling/ outdoors, cycling and walking around nature. I enjoy high cardio-related sports

**Personality:** I love working in a team. However, not a big team, I feel like I am more of an introverted person I like spending time having coffee with one person instead of a group if that makes sense

I think I reached a point of burnout fixed my CV like 25 times, took how to do an interview course, traveled  on a visit visa to 3  diff countries to look a job but nothing  I sent out more than 3,400 Job applications; out of those, I got 15 interviews, mostly in field/outdoor Sales in the GCC countries (I hate sales since it has a very high turnover and it's commission-based) I got two job offers which I rejected due to not having a car nor a car license nor the money to get a license.

***NOTE:*** I was born and lived as a ""third culture kid"" in the GCC, I don't have a strong passport, I can't go to the country in which I obtained the passport due to the high unemployment rate %, and I never felt a sense of belonging to that place.

My parents are forcing me to get a job in Sales in the meantime, which I believe will ruin my CV! What's the job market saying?  I see the Tech job market is over-saturated with people getting paid peanuts Entry Level jobs are getting automated with AI.

1jejqyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jejqyd/is_it_adhd_or_is_it_just_me/,Is it ADHD or is it just me?,"Is it ADHD or is it just me? 

I don’t know.

I have ADHD. At least I think I do. Psychiatrists and therapists seem to think so. And most of the time, I do, too. But I often gaslight myself. If you can call it that. That little voice in my head that goes, “Maybe you don’t have ADHD, maybe you’re just a screw up and using ADHD as an excuse so at least there’s a reason behind every mistake you make.” And trust me, I make a lot of mistakes. 

ADHD is weird because it is an actual condition, an actual disability. But trying to explain it to someone who does not have it? Not only is it difficult to explain, but many of its factors are issues everyone deals with. Just not on the same scale or to the same extent. So they'll be like ""Oh, I procrastinate, too! Oh, I forget things, too!"" Yes, but not on the scale or to the extent in which it derails your academic or. professional career, shutting doors and shooting down opportunities left and right. Relationships ending and the disappointed (or worse, exasperated) expression in people's faces when you make yet another mistake. All resulting in a steady flow of anxiety and self-loathing that negatively affects your overall well-being and mental health. And you're stuck in an endless loop of would've, could've, should've. 

I often feel like my own worst enemy. I bring myself to the precipice of a success before I falter at the last moment, toppling over and falling back down. Time and time again. Sometimes it's intentional, sometimes it's not.

Is it my fear of failure? Fear of inadequacy?

Or wanting to avoid responsibility, pressure, expectation?

Maybe a mix of everything.



It’s difficult for me to organize my thoughts. They swirl and wisp by like a swarm of gnats. I can never quite catch one and really examine it. 

And so it is difficult for me to organize my priorities. Or realize what my priorities are in the first place. 

Lots of things are difficult for me. Honestly, it feels like life itself has always been difficult. Waking up and getting ready, remembering to feed myself, drink water, the basics. Normal, everyday things that shouldn't take so much as a thought, I can’t even do those right. 



ADHD is difficult to explain. And it varies from person to person. But I’ll try my best.

ADHD is not just an issue with dopamine. It is your entire executive function that is impaired. 

So what exactly is impaired? 

Emotional control, remembering information and being able to use it, controlling your impulses, planning, getting started on tasks and following them through, being able to organize your thoughts and organize your outside surroundings, and being able to evaluate how you are doing in any given moment. All of which are pretty important, wouldn’t you say?



ADHD is categorized as a disability, and rightfully so. It can be utterly debilitating, especially if you’re unmedicated.



I struggle with controlling irritation and envy. I hate it. 

I hate that it is so difficult for me to be genuinely happy when one of my friends has some sort of success. Of course, I love them and want the best for them, but the envy just creeps in and lingers. The  familiar wrenching feeling of “They have an internship? I want that. They score well on an exam? I want that.” It makes me feel absolutely despicable. It make me feel like I'm a bad friend. I want to be a good friend. I want to be happy. I want to make my friends happy. 

Why do I get like this? Why am I like this?

Irritation is another one. I can’t help it, and it’s worse if I try to push it down. A day will be going perfectly but for some reason, something just ignites that one little trigger, the wick that sparks that flame in me. And suddenly, I’m being a bitch. And at the moment, I know how I am behaving, and I don’t know why. And I can’t give a good reason as to why. It’s confusing and annoying for everyone involved.

These negatively affect my relationships. But when I’m not being envious or a bitch (which isn’t often, I will say), I try my hardest to make up for it by being kind and understanding and helpful. 



I’m forgetful. I forget everything. Appointments, dates, birthdays, assignments, projects. I try sticky notes, reminder apps, calendars, writing with Sharpie on my hand. I forget to text my family and friends back all of the time, and I feel bad. And it hurts my relationships. My friends are more understanding, they struggle with mental health issues and also forget to text. So it’s more of a mutual understanding with them. But my family, despite my telling them I truly do forget, seem to think I ignore them intentionally. I don’t, and I wish they knew just how guilty I feel when I realize they texted days ago and I see it just now. Or when I tell myself I’ll text back, end up forgetting, and see their text again.

I have to be asked multiple times to do something, or else I forget. I forget about packages, they sit outside for a week. I forget to bring the cans out for trash and recycle day. I forget to feed myself. It just slips my mind. I even forget to drink water. I even forget when I’m cooking. I’ll leave something on the stove, forget, and only realize when smoke is filling the room. I worry about having a job in the future, and being asked to do something. Multiple things. Only to forget. How many times can that happen before you're fired? Not many, I presume.



I’m late. To everything. Even when I try to plan ahead, set alarms, lay things out ahead of time, I forget or lose something, and time somehow speeds up. But I’m always late. And I hate it. And I know others hate it as well. Time management is very difficult, and I always find myself studying the night before a test. A test I knew about from the beginning of the semester. But I forget and time, per usual, slips away from me. I do everything last minute, assignments, tasks, projects. I hate it. It’s not fun for me, the constant internal screaming of “Just do it, what is wrong with you, just get up and do it!” The physical discomfort, the constrained feeling I get, when I desperately want to do that task, knowing I need to, but I *can’t.* I stay up late. By late, I mean 3 am, 4 am, 5, 6, sometimes 7 am. Time gets away from me. I get lost in an assignment I procrastinated on, or I get stuck watching a tv show. It's difficult to break out of it once I'm locked in. I know my sleep schedule is flipped upside down, and I need to set it back on track. I'm a night owl, through and through. But nothing in my life is set up to accommodate that, like morning classes and lectures that follow. I can't try to study or focus in the morning or afternoon. So I stay up late, and for class days, I get three to four hours of sleep if I'm lucky. Or I don't sleep at all. And on days with no class, I crash and wake up at 4 pm. I hate it. 



I’m messy and disorganized. And when I am stressed, the mess grows bigger. My environment reflects the state of my mind, and often, I am a mess. I try to clean up but it somehow reappears within the next day or two. It’s not a huge mess. But it’s enough clutter to be distracting and mentally impeding. And if I’m trying to study, I end up trying to clean the mess instead. Four hours later, the mess is cleaned but I no longer have that rare motivation to go study. It’s dead.



It’s difficult for me to know how I’m doing in general. I won’t realize I’m hungry until my stomach has pains from not eating all day. Or if I am hungry, I plan to make food but forget and get lost in something else I’m doing. I won’t realize I’m not feeling well until I’m about to collapse. I also have difficulty categorizing pain. Like at the doctor’s. Is this painful? I don’t know. I’m not dying, so no? I’m not in complete agony, wanting to die, so no? The same goes for my mental state. I didn’t realize I was having some sort of mental breakdown bordering on mania, due to stress and sleep-deprivation, until a couple months later looking back on it, thinking “Damn, that was actually pretty bad. I was not thinking straight.” And I feel ashamed and guilty when I reflect, wondering how I even got to that point or if any of my friends or family noticed. Or if they thought I was just tired and not feeling well. I hope they didn't notice.



I’m impulsive. Boredom is a sentence worse than death. It’s not easy for me to get bored. I have the internet and books and games and the depths of my own mind, my tornado of thoughts. It's easy to keep myself entertained. Most of the time. But every once in a while, the fuel runs low and I get tired. My usual hobbies don’t excite or interest me. I don’t feel like going out or seeing friends. And along with this comes boredom. And with boredom comes restlessness, at least I think that’s what it is. It’s a sort of feeling that is uncomfortable, almost painful. And the overwhelming need to get rid of it. Restlessness consumes me if I’m not engaged or occupied in some way. And sometimes, restlessness gets the best of me, leading me to making poor decisions. Like going shopping with a friend instead of studying for a test two days away. Or staying out late at night when I have a class in the morning. My first year of college was the most evident of my impulsivity. Every single weekend, without fail, my friends and I partied and drank copiously. And if there were no parties or if I was bored during the week, I'd go on dates with people I wasn't particularly interested in, even when I knew I had to study or had class the next day. I halted my first year activities but still. I find any and all ways to satiate my hunger for entertainment. For satisfaction. 

But I am never satisfied. That’s been an overarching theme I’ve noticed in my life. The reason I can never quite be fully content. I’m always looking for more. And I hate it. I wish I could stop and just be happy with what I have. With what I’m doing. But I’m not. And I don’t think I ever will be.



I don’t know how much of this is ADHD or just me and my personal issues and past experiences. Or probably a combination. 

But I do know ADHD definitely plays a role.

ADHD is incredibly disruptive. 

It hindered my potential to learn basic skills, such as studying, how to plan ahead, and how to set and keep track of goals. An issue that has and continues to haunt me throughout my entire college experience.

It impedes my ability to abide by systems set up in everyday life. Like going to lectures and listening to a professor talk for an hour or more while paying attention and taking notes, not being distracted by the other seventy people in the room? Or going to the grocery store every other week, remembering what I even need, not forgetting about food in the fridge, and then being able to cook everyday? Or just waking up at a decent time every morning, remembering to eat, and going wherever I need to go on time, without forgetting anything important?



Meds do work, and many of the things I mentioned happen when I am unmedicated, since I don't take meds every single day. I am way less of a mess with meds. I pop a pill and thirty minutes later, my sense of apathy, obliviousness, and aimlessness vanish, and my motivation and desire to plan and actually do things sets in. I am able to get things done. Not a lot. And I can't always choose what I focus on. But meds greatly help. I wish I didn’t need meds to try to live normally. I wish I didn’t have a mental countdown starting the minute I take my meds, doing as much as I can before they wear off. Or if I don't do as much or get stuck in a frozen state, I consider that day a ""waste,"" feeling like I failed. I wish I could naturally be motivated and just do things without a second thought, without the immense time and effort everything usually takes. I wish I was like my friends, who in one day, go to every class, pay attention, take notes, get coffee with someone, go to the grocery store if they need to, cook and eat dinner, go to the library, and study until midnight. And be ready to do it again the next day. 

How? Literally how? It's like a magic trick. And the college I go to, which is relatively prestigious, I am surrounded by seemingly magical people every day. Physics, computer science, engineering, and chemistry majors who go above and beyond, who also work in labs or do internships, are still able to be in clubs, have a social lives, and even party on the weekends. And they're able to get As and Bs in their classes. They freak out if they get a B. It's difficult to not feel inadequate. Not feel like a fraud, like I'm miles behind. When everyone else around me makes everything look so easy. And I know they probably struggle and have their own issues. But it doesn't change the fact that they're able to do all of that. And I can't even do a fraction of it. See, there I go with the envy again.



Meds do work, but they can’t work miracles. I need to learn basic skills. I need to learn how to study, how to plan, how to keep track of time. How do I do that? 

ADHD is a reason, a valid one, but I can’t keep using it as an excuse.

I’m tired of being my own worst enemy. Of getting in my own way. Of tanking my own opportunities. Of feeling like a bystander in my own life. Of never feeling in control of my own body and mind.

I am smart and capable. I've made it this far, most of my life being unmedicated up until a year ago. So I know I can do even better. When I actually put in time and effort, I do well. Excel even.

So how can I actually consistently do that? I know, time and effort, two things I greatly struggle with.

But I don’t know what to do with time, it always runs away from me. And effort? Effort requires motivation, and it is so difficult for me to find that spark and keep hold of it. Or if I do find it, using it on the correct objective.

I know that's a me-problem, and I need to fix it. I know I need to get a grip. I know I need self-discipline, a routine, and systems set in place. But all of that is easier said than done. I've tried so many various methods and tools, but I can never seem to actually successfully fix my issues or if I do, maintain those solutions or methods I implement. Everything falls apart eventually.

People with ADHD, if you have any solid advice or methods that genuinely work for you, please share. This was a bit impromptu, I hyperfocused and wrote this instead of watching and taking notes on a recording of a lecture I missed. I don't know how much of this post makes sense. Or how much of it can be attributed to ADHD. They're just my feelings and experiences. But the fact that I wrote this is just another blaring alarm that something has to change. I want to do better. I want to be better. I want to be productive and reliable and efficient. But I don’t know how. And I’m hoping some tips will be able to help me. And maybe help anyone experiencing similar issues.

I turned and showed her the poop bags I always take along with me, and I said no. She continued yelling: “People’s dogs are always shitting in my yard and I’m tired of it” and on and on. 
 
This was the fourth time this neighbor has accosted me over this while I’m walking my dog. Not only have I never left dog shit in her yard—I’m very conscientious about keeping bags with me, because I also hate it when people don’t clean up after their dogs—but my dog has never once shit in this lady’s yard. I assume she just screams at every dog owner who passes?

Anyway, it was 8 am and I hadn’t had coffee yet and I said, “Fuck off, lady.” She started shouting louder, and I rather pathetically responded, “Stop yelling at me!” before I turned and went home.

Now it’s the evening, and I’ve cooled off a bit, and I’ve started to feel a bit bad for swearing at her. I’ve never interacted with this person outside of being berated over nonexistent dog shit. But I get her annoyance—I’d be pissed off too if dogs were always shitting in your yard and people weren’t cleaning up. I get it. But also, maybe approach me like a human being first before we fight over poop. 

I’m normally not the sort of person to get into fights with strangers so I’ve thought a lot about this interaction. I certainly could have been more diplomatic. There wasn’t a need to swear. But I’m tired of this. What do yall think? AITAH here? ",5,1742341797.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

Clearly the caramel ones are more popular, so cut your double espresso’s by a quater and give us more of the caramel.

If you’re starting your first eCommerce store, the biggest mistake you can make is trying to reinvent the wheel. You don’t need a *unique* store. You need a *profitable* one.

So, here’s the **exact strategy** that will get you to your first 100 sales without wasting time or money. 🚀

# Step 1: Find a proven winner

* Go to **SimilarWeb** (free trial available).
* Search for stores in your niche with **400K+ visitors/month**.
* Check their **Meta (Facebook) ads library** to see what’s running.

# Step 2: Copy-Paste Success

* **DO NOT** tweak, customize, or ""improve"" anything at first.
* Find a store that’s already killing it.
* Clone their **product page, ad creatives, and offer**.
* Your first goal? **Fast results.** Once you get sales, then optimize.

# Step 3: Track & Analyze Competitors

* Take **5-10** stores from Facebook Ad Library.
* Use **SimilarWeb** to track traffic and insights.
* Make a Google Sheet with:
   * Store name
   * Product page link
   * Facebook Ads link
   * Visitors per month
   * Notes (e.g. unique angles, pricing)

# Step 4: Choose Your Best Shot

* Pick the **top 3** competitors.
* Identify the easiest one to replicate.

# Step 5: Launch & Scale

* Find a supplier (**AliExpress, Temu, etc.**).
* **Duplicate their product page & ads.**
* Start a Facebook ad campaign **($25/day minimum)**.

💡 **Pro tip:** Most beginners fail because they don't **study competitors enough**. Look at their landing pages, ads, and traffic sources DAILY.

# What Next?

Getting your first sales is just the beginning. After that, you need: ✅ Conversion optimization (CRO)  
✅ Better creatives & copywriting  
✅ A rock-solid campaign structure

Hiya, Im George, 26, from Poland, monogamous, queer, work remotely in vidya. I'm pansexual, demi-romantic, used to identify as ace. Im an atheist, apolitical, but heavily left if anything, I believe there's good in everyone, i can a bit too hopeful and trusting, but it is what it is xd

I can be clingy, overthinking and oversharing, but i mean well and i want to have no things unsaid. I'm silly, sometimes too dumb, gonna laugh at farts and loud noises, my sense of humour is really broken. My love language is cuddles, pebbling, talking about everything, im a sucker for head scratches. I'm in therapy, mental health is really important to me, I've resolved most of my trauma but there's still some way to go, no baggage tho. I suffer from CPTSD and MDD, but its getting better.

\- cinema - i absorb series and movies, will watch anything and everything, adore Eggers, Anderson, Miyazaki,

I don't mind the gender nor the looks, id like to find someone similar to me so we can yap together and share this little life as much as we can. It's important to me to meet in person (after some time ofc), so i would prefer someone from Europe. If i didnt scare ya with the wall of text and my quirks feel free to shoot me a DM and tell me a bit about yourself. Thanks and have a good one :>

There always seems to be something washing machine needs replacing, the oven fan breaking, the sofa legs snapping new tyres from a puncture in a tyre These aren’t small costs either, even down to sending letters a pack of stamps is extortionate.

Mot and service and car tax insurance and fuel. Child’s basic hobbies and clothing/things the require it is unbelievable pricey. Gas electric is sky high, water, even on the basic WiFi package and sim only deals for a fiver what more can one save back on? It baffles me that people think this is a choice, yet the costs of children and running a home are extortion, how do people afford luxuries like holidays, never mind cinema/bowling trips /theme parks/water parks/ or any sort of family activities out and about that is easy £200 + day out it is relentless and constant all the time.

No smoking drinking gambling and yet there is nothing spare at all. 

New bedding  4 pillows quilt covers from supermarkets £100+. A bike then the helmet to go with it. Cups and plates or cleaning products from home-bargains just add up. Over counter medicine no change from a £20. Flee and worm for the dog £15 a month. No tv subscriptions either. How do people afford to get married /honeymoon/ buy over priced jewellery. 

Our wedding was £152 register office fee with a £10 sterling silver ring each I’m glad though about that. But I’m sure I read the average wedding is 40k now.

Kicked off in Indianapolis with the Indy Motor Speedway museum – cool and quiet, just my speed. Slept in a cheap motel off the highway. Ohio threw a curveball when my GPS died; I wandered backroads for an hour before finding Columbus. The motel that night had a loud heater – wish I’d packed warmer clothes.

Louisville was the last big stop. Strolled Old Town, grabbed coffee, and camped one night in a state park. Favorite oddity was Indiana’s giant ball of paint – weirdly fun. The best part was the freedom to stop wherever, no debates needed. I’ve been using this [cool app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id6741556826) to track states, and marking Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky felt satisfying.

Rough spot? Eating solo at a diner felt off with just me and my thoughts. Tips: bring a map, pack layers, check out small towns. It’s an 8/10 – simple, but a solid reset.",15,1742340894.0,roadtrip,3,0.95,False

I worked for rent and I thought that was fair until they kept piling on the work for the same room I was “renting”. Due to the housing crisis I stayed because finding a place was difficult enough and I was scared that my employer would find out I was trying to find another place and kick me out before I found a place. In retrospect they probably wouldn’t do that but I was young and just ran away from an(other) abusive relationship.

The first year I worked there I begged my employer to let me sleep in Christmas Day because I knew no one would come to this place for shitty coffee if they have family over. But they said they weren’t taking a chance and told me to open up. No one came by.

When I did take vacations I had to pay my employer rent because “I can’t rent the room while you’re away with all your stuff in it.”

I was exhausted but I’m finally out and my employer said how unprofessional it was to quit with no notice. I thought it was unprofessional of them to human traffic but I didn’t tell them that because I didn’t want them to hide the evidence. Thankfully my lawyer is dealing with everything right now.

Please understand I can’t go into detail just yet about what kind of work I did and where I worked. Let’s just say those family run businesses are as dysfunctional as a real family.",4,1742340872.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

I love seeing how my and others’ top 10 change with time and trends! It’s also super interesting to see exactly why the things we feel like we need to have in our collection changes; is it because it’s special? Practical? Versatile? If you had to narrow (or expand) your collection to 10, what fragrances are in it and why? These are mine:

SIGNATURES/VERSATILE
- Le Labo The Matcha 26: this has been my signature scent for just over a year now and I’m just as much in love with it as I was when I first discovered it. It’s comforting, has some of my favorite notes (fig and matcha), and so special.
- The Harmonist Magnetic Wood: this is a recent love but one I know will be cherished in my collection for a long time. It is so special and unlike anything I’ve smelled personally, and it was purely by chance that I smelled it; I never would have chosen to try it based on the notes or anything like that. Feels like I was meant to love it!
- Maison Margiela Replica Coffee Break: Lavender latte. This has been a favorite since the very beginning of my fragrance hobby, and my eyes still roll back when I smell it. While it is more of a gourmand, the coffee isn’t overwhelming, and the amount of lavender is perfect imo. It’s sweet but not thick, aromatic but only slightly. So comforting; I wear it to bed sometimes. 

WORK FRIENDLY
- Diptyque L’eau Papier: Warm and musky, and I love the sesame/rice smell it has while still being a little bit sweet. I have the limited edition holiday 2023 bottle, and I love looking at it on my shelf as much as I love wearing it. I work in healthcare, and my coworkers comment positively on it very often. This scent also has sentimental value to me; it was one of the first scents I tried when getting into more niche houses.
- Diptyque Ilio: this is probably my favorite fruity floral ever, despite how ephemeral it is. In fact, the bad lasting power is what makes me comfortable enough to wear it to work. Iris and prickly pear, with a pretty jasmine drydown. I don’t mind the reapplication at all. This also has sentimental value for the same reason L’eau Papier does.
- Lake & Skye 11:11: my favorite aldehydic soft clean skin scent out of all the ones that exist in the space currently. Not much to say other than it’s really, really good. I prefer it HEAVILYYY to glossier you, merit retrospect, and the like. 

SPECIAL OCCASIONS
- The Harmonist Moon Glory: syrupy, sweet, beautiful night out scent. Lychee and honey, nuclear performance, and a lovely scent bubble make this perfect for nighttime occasions. Not as daytime appropriate tbh. 
- Xerjoff Dama Bianca: tbh, I’m not super passionate about this one, but it’s a placeholder for a daytime special occasion scent. It’s pretty and my favorite I’ve smelled so far to fit this spot in my collection: lovely purple flowers, a pretty fruity opening, a soft vanilla drydown, and great lasting performance. However, I’m just not particularly moved by it, you know? If anyone else has anything they can recommend along these lines, please do!

FUN GOURMANDS
- Kayali Yum Pistachio Gelato: as unimpressed as I am by kayali fragrances as a whole, this one is so good and unique as far as gourmands go. It inspired a whole lot of dupes and was one of the first fragrances in the trendy pistachio wave. I love pistachio, and this one is sweet yet cool and clean because of the soapiness. 
- Kilian Princess: I still haven’t gotten over the hype on this one. Marshmallow, matcha, and ginger? It’s so good and more unique of a gourmand. Finery (the Target fragrance line) makes a BANGER dupe; it’s like 95% similar and tbh it’s more marshmallowy than the Kilian on my skin. If I still like it as much as I do now when I run out I’ll likely buy the target one.

HONORABLE MENTION
- Liquides Imaginaires Blanche Bête: I love this one downnnn and just had to mention it but could not justify kicking off any of the ones in my top 10 for it, so alas. Probably my favorite lactonic scent so far.",15,1742340865.0,FemFragLab,16,0.94,False
1jejcf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/chiari/comments/1jejcf4/2_day_headacheextreme_sinus_issues/,2 day headache/extreme sinus issues.,"Hi all, 

So I've been having extreme ""explosive"" migraines since I was a kid. My mom figured they were caffeine headaches & would give me coffee/ Tylenol. During these headaches I would have slurred speech, weakness (esp n legs & arms), blurry vision, extreme congestion, extreme head pressure and eye pressure. I would have extreme nausea and the feeling off syncope. I never had any imagining done as a child/teenager. Fast forward to my first pregnancy I would get more of these headaches & would stay n the hospital a lot where I would get fluids and IV headache meds. Still no imaging. After my second pregnancy I started to have a lot of issues with my pituitary gland/prolactin and was diagnosed with a small tumor. I took meds to shrink it & soon after that I was pregnant with my 3rd child. After the birth of my 3rd child I was told that it wasn't a tumor but a cyst? Well my 3rd child is now 4.(Born n 2021) And my headaches seem even worse now so I recently finally had a scan of my whole brain( after my 2nd child I was only getting pituitary scans) and it stated that it was normal by one dr. But I had another check it also and he asked me if I had ever been diagnosed with chiari malformation & that my cerebellum is going into my brain stem? Since then ive been rethinking my migraines completely and I'm honestly scared now because I still get pretty bad headaches but when they come now I notice that I'm also getting spine pain? Yesterday I went into work fine and suddenly was overcome by sinus congestion/runny nose and eventually I started feeling right side pressure and eye pressure and knew a bad headache was coming along so I ended up going home. Once I got home I laid down immediately but laying down made the pressure worse and I couldn't get comfortable to sleep. I ended up all night long vomiting, chills, sweats and insane congestion. When I wasnt congested my nose and eyes would just water and leak. The pressure in my head felt like my head was going to explode. The back of my shoulders felt stiff and my lower back hurt so bad that I felt tingling and pain shooting into my thighs. My vision was very blurry and I eventually couldn't walk or talk clearly. I felt very weak. I ended up calling out today due to pressure still being prominent. When I asked my Dr if it could be chiari related he told me it seems like a migraine and for me to see neurologist? Are these symptoms related to chiari? I am on the process of trying to get a cine MRI but it's been so hard. The original person that did my MRI report did not mention the chiari at all another dr found it. Any help is appreciated. Ive been in bed since yesterday afternoon and even tho the worst has passed I still have a lot of eye/head pressure and my nose is still runny. ",1,1742340859.0,chiari,0,1.0,False

Speaking about my personal experience, my friendships in my teens and early 20s were VERY shallow and I never really shared my true personality and interests, so I’d really like to meet other women I can relate to. 

So if you’re interested feel free to share some basic information about yourself and reach out to others!

I'm going to reduce the amount by 0.2 grams per day for 34 days, then I'll be caffeine free in the early mornings. 
I considered reducing by 0.1g / day but that would take 68 days which seems like ages! 
My second coffee of the day will be dealt with separately. The second coffee tends to be a machine coffee, so I'm planning to go every other day, then every 3 days, then quit that one as well. Aiming to quit that (second) one in the next 14 days. 
Posting for accountability and in case it helps motivate anyone else. 
I've tried quitting before a year ago (very slowly over 3 months taper that time) but went back after 2 weeks caffeine free!! 
Having recently quit alcohol (30 days, going good) I'm super determined to remove caffeine from my life as well. 
I'll see if I can post some updates as time goes on.

1jej558,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jej558,Myvatn in March: Highlights,"We're just back from 4 nights in Myvatn (March 13 - 17). This was our 2nd trip to Iceland, but first time to the north. We are from New England, so used to cold/winter driving/harsh weather. The northern lights came out on our last night, and were the most vibrant I’ve ever seen! 

**Rental Car:** We rented from Lava Rental Car. Our only challenge was we went out the door at Keflavik closer to the bus drop offs and missed the first shuttle at 5AM. But otherwise, very easy, affordable, and they give you all the gas discount key fobs.

**The Drive:** Yes, it's about 6 hours from Keflavik to Myvatn, but it was almost a wash with a flight if you factor in the airport transfer and layover time. It's a beautiful drive - but we could split up the driving which helped a lot. 

**Hotel:** We stayed at Myvatn - Berjaya Iceland Hotel. Very clean, firm but comfy beds, excellent in-room coffee. The breakfast was a little pricy, but there is literally nothing else in the area this time of year, and it was actually a good spread. Great cocktails at the bar for happy hour too. 

**Meals:** So, not a ton of options in the area off season! But we had excellent meals at Vogafjos Farm Restaurant - so good, we went 2 nights in a row! The hotel restaurant was also tasty, but limited. 

We drove into Akureyri for brunch on Sunday, and had maybe the best brunch of my life at Strikið. Worth the hour drive, the toll, worth it all. 

**Activity Highlights:**

* [Snowmobiling with GeoTravel](https://geotravel.is/tour/wilderness-snowmobiling-day-tour/) \- There really wasn't a lot of snow in the area, so we went to their further camp about 20 minutes from base. Excellent guide, gorgeous scenery. 
* [Myvatn Nature Baths](https://myvatnnaturebaths.is/) \- Beautiful, relaxing, very chill compared to the Blue Lagoon. 

We also did a bunch of hikes/walks in the area including Hverfjall and Krafla. YakTrax or microspikes highly recommended. 

All in all - Myvatn was the perfect base camp. We were glad we didn’t stay in Akureyri because all the activities we did were local; but maybe would have been fun to do a night there just for the food scene.

Lyn Bartolo, an artist from Queensland, has this incredible ethereal painting style, and we knew a plain, boxy website wasn’t going to do her work justice. Instead, we focused on creating an immersive experience—big visuals, clean transitions, and a layout that lets the artwork breathe. No clutter, no distractions—just the art, front and center, like it should be.

The biggest challenge? Making it all feel seamless on mobile without losing that ""gallery"" feel. But after some creative problem-solving (and way too much coffee), we made it happen.

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]  MVP already talking about “Terra Solar 2”...** **Manny V. Pangilinan** [[link](https://www.philstar.com/business/2025/03/17/2428848/mvp-leviste-partner-anew-solar-project)] was already talking about plans for what he calls “Terra Solar 2” while his deal makers closed the $600 million transaction between **Actis** and **MGen, SP New Energy’s** [SPNEC 1.22 ▼2.4%] parent company. MVP said the next big mega solar project will be in Batangas, on land owned by **Solar Philippines** (the private company owned by **Leandro Leviste**). MVP isn’t sure about exactly how big Terra Solar 2 will be, and cast some doubt as to whether it would be as big as Terra Solar 1 which is slated to be completed in 2027, but he conceded, “it will still be a significant project”.
>    - ***MB:*** Small point, but if I were Actis, I’d be righteously pissed off to have my partner bloviating in the media about a second mega solar project that my fund isn’t even a part of. While Actis is quite large, funds like to use these events (like the closing of a $600 million deal) to hype their work to stakeholders, and that desire to put on rose-colored glasses and look to the future is one that I’ve witnessed first-hand, regardless of fund size. This feels like yet another example of MVP’s “open mic” problem, where he just can’t seem to resist giving gossipy little teasers about his behind-the-scenes work. Was this the time and place to casually drop Terra Solar 2 (2 Terra, 2 Solar)? Maybe the goal was to throw a little seasoning into the news mix to lessen the “sell the news” tendency of short-term traders. SPNEC was up 1% on the day, so, maybe, mission accomplished?

>- **[UPDATE]  Top Line prices IPO at ₱0.31/share...** **Top Line** [TOP] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=2665cb1834cb6f91ec6e1601ccee8f59)] notified the exchange that it would price its upcoming IPO at ₱0.31/share, which is an 18% discount from the ₱0.38/share revised price, and a 60% discount from the ₱0.78/share original price. While no updated prospectus has been made available as of this writing, a source connected with the company indicated that the reduction in proceeds would only impact the “working capital” and “general corporate purposes” line items in the Use of Proceeds section. The build-out of the service stations is untouched. In a statement, the company said: “The final offer price takes into account current market conditions while still ensuring that Top Line can pursue its strategic initiatives, including establishing new fuel stations and expanding its logistics capabilities with additional fuel trucks and tankers with its net proceeds. We are also very pleased with the strong coverage of our books at this offer price and believe it presents significant upside potential for prospective investors.”
>    - ***MB:*** A lower price will mean more interest, but has all this cutting dropped the price to a place where IPO buyers can hope for a big listing day pop? That’s the part that remains to be seen. There are a lot of people in my circle who are bearish on fuels, but when I talk to them, their complaints quickly devolve into ad hominem attacks against **Dennis Uy’s Phoenix** [PNX] and vague frustration at **Petron** [PCOR 2.37 ▼0.8%] and its inability to do anything of interest with its industry-leading distribution network of service stations. There’s never a question about the demand for new cars, the pressure on our road network to grow, and the opportunities for companies like TOP to play a significant role in the road networking of the country. At least TOP comes to the market with strong leadership (unlike PNX) and less debt than PCOR.

>- **[NEWS]  Ayala Corp board approves ₱20-B prefs sale...** The **Ayala Corp** [AC 596.50 ▼1.5%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=bacbd6383ff0ca18ec6e1601ccee8f59)] board of directors approved a plan to issue up to ₱20 billion in peso-denominated preferred shares. The issuance will have a base offer of up to ₱10 billion, with an oversubscription of up to an additional ₱10 billion. AC didn’t provide any further details.
>    - ***MB:*** AC raised ₱15 billion in October through a similar preferred shares sale with a similar “base + 100% oversubscription” configuration. Back then, they sold the full amount of the firm offer and half of the oversubscription. If AC were able to do the same this time, they’d pull in the same ₱15 billion. While they didn’t mention what the money is for, it’s probably also for the same reason: to juggle debt. The previous prefs were sold to raise money to redeem other preferred shares. There seems to be a vibrant market for defensive investments right now.

The price of everything is colossal surely it isn’t sustainable longevity wise.
We are Mortage free so don’t pay a Mortage or rent and yet I don’t see what more cloth we could cut?!
I never have my hair done or any form of beauty products. Do my own eyebrows. Even cut child’s hair myself. The dog we have clippers for so no grooming costs. Only have one car that is fully paid for and no other debt.
There always seems to be something washing machine needs replacing, the oven fan breaking, the sofa legs snapping new tyres from a puncture in a tyre These aren’t small costs either,
Even down to sending letters a pack of stamps is extortionate. Mot and service and car tax insurance and fuel. Child’s basic hobbies and clothing/things the require it is unbelievable pricey. Gas electric is sky high, water, even on the basic WiFi package and sim only deals for a fiver what more can one save back on? It baffles me that people think this is a choice, yet the costs of children and running a home are extortion, how do people afford luxuries like holidays, never mind cinema/bowling trips /theme parks/water parks/ or any sort of family activities out and about that is easy £200 + day out it is relentless and constant all the time. Or two cars or private number plates new laptops/phones / new clothes / footwear Ive not had a new bra in years! Eating out or takeaways there’s no change from £50 for low quality. £80 for Sunday lunch out with none alcoholic drinks.  Glasses we have the basics at £20 from glasses direct. No smoking drinking gambling and yet there is nothing spare at all. New bedding  4 pillows quilt covers from supermarkets £100+. A bike then the helmet to go with it. Cups and plates or cleaning products from home-bargains just add up. Over counter medicine no change from a £20. Flee and worm for the dog £15 a month. No tv subscriptions either. How do people afford to get married /honeymoon/ buy over priced jewellery. Our wedding was £152 register office fee with a £10 sterling silver ring each I’m glad though about that. But I’m sure I read the average wedding is 40k now. Holidays 5k at least a week, our child’s friends parents across all hobbies and schools go on at least 3/4 a year, mega money that I just don’t see how unless it is all debt, new mop and bucket or light bulbs celeotape batteries ( I’ve even stopped doing cards for a lot of people) never mind a coffee out (I don’t drink coffee either ) or a kindle subscription. A roof rack or bike rack sets you back hundreds a lawn mower or shed.

1jej248,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1jej248/i_ended_things_with_my_manipulative_boyfriend/,I ended things with my manipulative boyfriend!!,"
Hey everyone! So I broke up with my boyfriend after a year together back in jan. He took 9 months to tell his family about me, and 10 to ask me to actually be his girlfriend, however by this point, we were certainly together. He was going out with other girls for coffee but didn’t see the issue with not telling me for months. He also accused me of cheating as I turned my location off, however I did this as i got incredibly sick, not being able to walk so was going nowhere. He would text me saying a girl won’t stop texting him but never actually told them he was seeing someone, despite me encouraging him to say that. The list goes on, so needless to say I broke up with him (even though he couldn’t understand why). 

I got back together with him a month or so later as I felt I didn’t give him a chance. I explained my feelings and he said he loved to hear where he went wrong and that i should have said earlier (as if communication was the issue…). First week back was great. I got flowers from him for the first time, and it seemed better UNTIL he said the reason I broke up with him must have been because me and my family were jealous of his achievements! He was making it very clear that he did not know what my issues were, and couldn’t see a problem with his behaviour, despite him seeming pretty coherent when we rekindled. He also turned everyone against me after the first breakup, but then said it’s my problem what people think of me. 

My final straw was him asking me how much my rates were, got up and threw £300 of cash at me whilst I was on the bed, albeit doing it jokingly and I went along with it. I just don’t think this is something one should do whilst trying again with the relationship. I ended things a few days ago as it just wasn’t working. Aside from all that, we had a fun relationship! 

I feel as if I didn’t really express my feelings enough in the relationship, and maybe instead of ending things, I should have said more of how I felt? Or should he have just used common sense to not treat me like that? But since he’s now going around calling me a psycho to everyone, it makes me think I did make the right decision. Any advice appreciated!",8,1742340077.0,TwoHotTakes,6,0.83,False

If I drink one, it makes my hands shake and twitch so bad that I can barely function or hold a pen, and it’s just bad for my anxiety in general lol.

I’m looking for an alternative since I enjoy energy drinks for the taste and the carbonation rather than the caffeine. Everything else I’ve tried just doesn’t hit the same… soda (too sweet) sparkling water (not sweet at all lol), I even tried an Italian soda (i.e. sparkling water with the same flavors I get in my energy drinks) and it’s close but just not the same argh! It’s missing that specific undercurrent I can’t explain! 

I should mention my favorite energy drink is Black Rock Coffee Bar’s, so if anyone has any suggestions for a low-caf or caffeine-free alternative to that, I’d love to know :>

The floss gets stuck in that area due to the filling so I need to yank it out, causing pain. I've stopped flossing that area past 2 days. 

I'm at the point where I'm going to book a dentist, any who is available asap, but is it STUPID to ask them to remove that disgusting filling and add a new one as opposed to going for a root canal? 

Cause the nerve is definitely still very much in working order and it just feels so sad to have to result to a root canal.

Tips and Variations for Perfecting Your Crockpot Desserts
---------------------------------------------------------

Crockpot desserts can transform any gathering into a sweet celebration, and with the right tips and variations, you can master the art of slow-cooked treats. Your best bet for delicious crockpot desserts begins with understanding what works best in this magical kitchen appliance. Here are some tips to ensure your creations are delightful and full of flavor.

### Choose the Right Ingredients

Ingredients are the heart of any tasty dessert. When working with your crockpot, always opt for fresh, high-quality options. Here are some recommendations:

 *Shop Here--&gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Crockpots *​  
  
- **Fruits:** Consider seasonal fruits such as berries, peaches, or apples. They add natural sweetness and bring a vibrant flavor to your dessert.
- **Sweeteners:** While granulated sugar works well, consider using honey or maple syrup for a unique touch. These alternatives can add depth and a hint of caramel flavor.
- **Dairy Options:** Full-fat creams or simple yogurt can enrich your dessert, but for a lighter version, try almond or coconut milk.
- **Baking Essentials:** Baking powder, vanilla extract, and spices like cinnamon or nutmeg can elevate your dishes significantly. Experiment to find the combination that suits your taste.

### Layering Flavors** Creating a depth of flavor is key to perfecting your crockpot desserts. Layer your ingredients wisely to achieve a balanced taste profile:

- **Start with the base:** If you’re making something like a cobbler or a cake, place thicker ingredients at the bottom, such as chopped fruit or batter.
- **Add texture:** Layer in nuts, oats, or crumbles to introduce a contrasting texture. This technique works beautifully for crumbles or pudding types of desserts.
- **Finish strong:** Save any toppings like chocolate chips or coconut flakes for the end. Adding them close to the end cook time helps maintain their original texture.

### Control Cooking Time

Cook time can vary among crockpot models, so it’s essential to keep an eye on the clock. Here are some pointers:

- **Cook on low:** Most desserts benefit from being cooked on low heat, allowing them to develop flavor without burning. Aim for around 4-5 hours.
- **Use a timer:** Set a reminder for yourself to check your dessert periodically. This can prevent overcooking, especially if your crockpot runs hotter than others.

### Explore Delightful Variations

Don’t hesitate to get creative with your crockpot desserts. Whether you want a rich chocolate treat or a fruity delight, the options are endless! Here are some delicious variations to try:

- **Chocolate Lava Cake:** Use a brownie mix combined with chocolate chips and pour a mixture of creamy caramel in the center. Serve with vanilla ice cream.
- **Peach Cobbler:** Fresh peaches layered with a cinnamon-spiced biscuit topping can be an irresistible summer dessert, especially when paired with whipped cream.
- **Banana Pudding:** Alternate layers of sliced bananas, vanilla pudding, and crushed cookies in your crockpot. Add a sprinkle of cinnamon for extra flavor.

### Stay Adventurous

Don’t stick solely to traditional recipes. Try integrating various cultures into your crockpot creations:

- **Indian-inspired rice pudding:** Use coconut milk, basmati rice, and cardamom for a delightful twist.
- **Mexican chocolate pudding:** Mix cocoa powder with Mexican spices for a bold flavor. Pair it with whipped cream or fresh berries.

Remember that the best crockpot dessert outcomes often result from trial and error. Fine-tune your recipes based on what you and your loved ones enjoy the most. Engage with family and friends by letting them suggest flavors or themes for your next dessert — this can add excitement and anticipation!

 *Shop Here--&gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Crockpots *​** With these tips and variations, you'll be well-equipped to create delightful crockpot desserts that surprise and satisfy every sweet tooth. Happy cooking, and enjoy the sweet surprises that await you!

Sometimes I kind of feel high or drunk even though I am not. I can no longer drink coffee or all of these symptoms exacerbate and I feel sick. and I used to drink coffee every day. I also used to smoke weed every day but it made my symptoms worse and gave me panic attacks so I quit probably 6 months ago. Weirdly if I drink I don't have any problems and don't really have any symptoms. I don't drink a lot, maybe one to two times a week and when I do I only drink beer. The symptoms actually got so bad that I once went to the hospital because I thought there might be a gas leak in my apartment but they said my bloodwork came back fine. They also said that it probably wasn't neurological because I passed the physical tests but I didn't get an MRI or anything at the hospital.

I have hypothyroidism and have had it my whole life. I have gone to my PCP a lot with these symptoms and he doesn't think it is thyroid-related. My TSH usually hovers around 5-6 and my Free T4 is in the 1.4-1.5 range. Also through blood tests, I tested for high cholesterol and am taking atorvistatin and low Vitamin D which I am taking a prescribed supplement for. I have been on 50 mcg of Levothyroxine for a couple of years now and I recently switched to 50 mcg of Synthroid thinking maybe the generic was giving me problems but it seems like that isn't the case. I tried 75 mcg of Levothyroxine and it made the symptoms worse.

I was also on Lexapro for I would say 8 months starting in 2023 not sure exactly when and stopped taking it around May or June of 2024 thinking it was contributing to my sudden weight gain.

I have been taking numerous supplements to try and rule out any deficiencies but nothing is really helping. I have taken NAC, Fish Oil, Magnesium, K2, Ashwagandha, Multivitamin, Iron, Vitamin B, C, and L-Theanine.

Since the spring of 2024, I have gained probably around 15-20 pounds. I'm 5'6"" and weighed around 140-145 pounds and now weigh 163 pounds. I didn't really workout at all from November 2024 to February 2025 but I have been working out for about 2-3 days a week for the past month and a half. These symptoms are present when working out sometimes but are usually not debilitating or keeping me from working out.

I'm really hoping someone here can help me or at least help me with the verbiage to tell my doctor. This is really affecting my life and I just want to get to the bottom of what it might be. I appreciate any comments and feedback. Thank you.",1,1742339550.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I know most men probably just jam it inane out each time but I have to believe there is a unicorn out there that did something innovative and efficient.

Some timeline info:

I-751 was received Sept. 5, 2023  
N-400 was received Aug. 30, 2024  
N-400 interview was scheduled Feb. 10, 2025 (notice did not include I-751)  
I-751 interview was scheduled with N-400 Mar. 4, 2025 (this notice was sent informally over e-mail)

Husband and I arrived 30 minutes before the interview time. The FO was not at all busy and was actually quite quiet. We were called at the exact time of our appointment. 

When we got to the room, the officer was actually virtual—we had a screen in front of us and a tablet on the side. The officer was chipper and pleasant. After we took our oath, she asked us to show our drivers licenses and my GC on the camera, and she took photos of it. Then she began with I-751. It was standard stuff, names, birthdays, address, date of marriage. She asked if we had any updated evidence we brought and I listed everything I brought with me.

- updated bank statements
- 2023 and 2024 tax transcripts**
- 2023 and 2024 state tax returns
- new car loan**
- new car registration**
- updated car insurance**
- updated health insurance claims
- airline tickets for our big trip this year
- utility account summary through the county**

Those with ** are what she ended up wanting a copy of. Someone came in to the office to take the documents to be scanned. 

After that, we moved on with the N-400. My husband stayed in the room.

We did the standard basic information again, and then the civics test. I got 6 correctly and then she moved on to the English reading and writing using the tablet. After that, she went over the questions on the N-400.

And then we were done! She informed us that she was approving both I-751 and N-400 today and that I should receive my schedule for the Oath Ceremony in the mail. Then someone came in to give me my N-652 showing approval.

The entire interview took around 30 minutes, so we were at the FO for an hour tops. My USCIS account updated with both approvals as we were in the car deciding where to get coffee. 

I know it’s not over until the naturalization certificate is in hand, but I’m glad the hard part is done. ",5,1742338928.0,USCIS,3,1.0,False

1jeiil7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HospitalityStories/comments/1jeiil7/hard_conversation_with_customer/,Hard conversation with customer,"Long post sorry 

I am a manager at a small local coffee shop in my area. Been working there for about 4 years, have good repore with customers and staff. 

Now we have this one customer, older gentleman, dresses a bit scruffy, mumbles alot when he talks but generally a harmless guy. He is very lonely, so I think he comes to us for the company. He has been coming in for about a year and a half.

He comes in most days, knows me and staff (only four of us) by name, has conversations with us about sports and the weather. The two  only conversation he is willing to have with anyone. Which is fine.
Over the year his eye sight and hearing has somewhat diminished, so when he talks to us its more of a statement than questions, because of the hearing loss. 
He always like to sit close to the counter when he orders his drink and food, so to talk (loudly) at us, but also to listen in on conversation we have with other customers. 

Over the last six months he has been inserting himself into every conversation my staff has had with customers. In the first couple of times this has happened, when I wasnt involved, the staff kind of laugh it off, and involve him in these small conversations out of kindness. He's lonely, we get it. 

When I saw and heard it the first time, it was with me chatting to a young female student, talking about her studies. The old man inserted himself into a conversation that was not involving him, which made the young student really uncomfortable as he was sitting  close to the counter talking AT her. 

As the days went on, that same student has come up to the glass doors of our coffee shop and looked in. Upon seeing the old man sitting next to the counter she turned and walked off. Obvious to me when I saw it, she did not want to be in conversation with him. 
Over the coming months I had made a mental note that some regular female customers had stopped coming in as much. 
All life factors could have impacted this, but I had my suspicions it might have been because of the old man.

It was confirmed when I was coming back from a break and a saw a regular customer on the street. Just stopped her to say 'Hi, how are you' and she just blurted out to me
'Not great actually' Then said. Your customer makes me feel really uncomfortable, and hes always there, and she avoids coming in to have any coffee because of him. 
That was quite a blow for me to hear. But I told her, I will have a conversation with the old man and see if I could change anything. 
She let me know it was no reflection on me or my staff, she loves seeing us and having conversations with us. Just not him.

That brings me to yesterday. 
Our old man has come in early  (earlier than usual) I ask him to join me on our table away from the counter and had a hard conversation with him.
I am not a confrontational person, but as a manager I felt I had to do it. 

'I need to have a conversation with you *name*, ive been told by some female customers that they no longer want to come in, as they feel uncomfortable with you trying to engage them conversations. Now as a customer here yourself, you have every right to be here, and with us *staff names* but as a business I do need you to be aware that when have conversations with other customers, it is our job. And it is our work. We need to read people, we engage them conversation if they want it, but I have seen that you have tried to engage some people especially females into a conversation that they don't feel comfortable with. And don't want to have. It has impacted the business, and i need you to be aware of it.'

At first he protested, and said im just trying to be friendly, and don't mean anything by it. 
I understood that, but kept re- iterating that it has impacted business. 
He wouldn't look at me, and kept saying I don't mean anything by it, but I felt i had to stand my ground and say you are always welcome here to have a coffee and food, but I'm going to have to insist you sit at another table and not to engage in any conversation with any female patrons. (Obviously if it is someone he knows, by all means he can have a conversation) 
He got really flustered and put out. Volume of his voice got louder, he kept saying ' I dont mean anything by it. Im just being friendly' 
I really had to stand my ground, and told him again in a calm tone, you are always welcome here to have coffee and food, but i need you to  go by these conditions i have stated. 
After a few more grumbling grunts by him he said he agrees to my conditions. So I left the conversation and the table with that.
Probably the most confrontational thing I have had to do at work. 
I felt proud I did it, but also slightly guilty, as he is an old lonely man. 

So today he has turned up, ordered his usual coffee and a slice of cake, took a seat away from the counter and kept to himself. He beacon me over to his table, and said gruffly
'Im far from the counter all right!'' I let him know thats fine with me, and thank you for taking our conversation yesterday serious. He just grunted.
So a hard conversation on my part was had with a customer, but it seems like it fell on open ears. So im proud I had the guts to do it. Because I really didn't want to.

Also im female BTW. 

Has there been any hard conversation y'all have had with customers that proved a good outcome?
