Thoughts?,Hi I was just got offered a store manager job and was told I would be put thru 9 weeks of training before taking over a store. I’ve been working as grocery store manager for the past 14 years has anyone from the grocery industry have any experience on how the transition to Starbucks worked out for them? How much of a difference is there between groceries and making coffee? Also to address I would initially take a paycut but from what was mentioned from recruiter there is so much more growth opportunities at Starbucks then where I currently work at.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/JNe8xFjdvLb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1g9ll14,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1g9ll14/socially_anxious_extrovert/,Socially anxious extrovert,"I’m a super outgoing, sociable person with great social skills. I can make people like me within a few minutes of us first speaking. The problem is that I’m so scared rejection that I dread the process of “revealing myself” to someone, which is necessary for forming a deep friendship. 

For example, this weekend I met someone as part of an informative coffee date. We hit it off, and she invited me to hangout this coming weekend. 

The problem is that I was cool as a cucumber and confident when we first met, but now that she is interested in hanging out and potentially becoming friends, I’m nervous! I’m nervous about being rejected. 

This fear of rejection makes me feel anxious during the actual hang-out, and it keeps me from completely relaxing. During a hangout,  I’m secretly waiting for the hangout to end, because it means I’ll no longer be under pressure to be cool/interesting/xyz.

I know al lI have to be is myself, but it’s really not that easy when I’m feeling anxious.

1g9lkxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1g9lkxs/i_wake_up_in_the_morning_i_am_sad/,I wake up in the morning  - I am sad.,"It's my first thought when I wake up in the morning. It has been this way for a very long time. Let me share with you:

""I'm sad"" 

Sometimes even before I open my eyes. This deeply patterned thought makes itself known and for a very long time would set the tone for my day. 

""Yeah, thats okay - you'll be alright soon. Just get up and get coffee going and then decide how you feel once you've finished your coffee, OK?""  

I respond, intentionally, with words such as these. It's important to do consistently, and supportively - I've been building better thought patterns for the last seven years, and I still need to kick start that correctly. No scolding myself, no indulging in rumination or anxiety, just accept it, be kind and then get moving.

I make my coffee. As I wait for it to cool down, I try a new meditation that I recently learned - the Breath of Fire Pranayama. It clears my mind, I put on some white noise (rain sounds) to continue to enjoy my morning coffee. 

""Rememebr, no reddit or scrolling the internet until you've completed your morning routine.""

I still need some time on the excersise bike, a shower and to put my thoughts into my journal. My coffee is done. I congratulate myself for not using Reddit and check in with how I feel. Am I still sad? No I'm fine.

""Oh-kay just a few more things to do to set up a good day - if it's not so good today, thats okay - I will take another shot at it tomorrow.""

Just do your best today.

1g9lkkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1g9lkkm/opv_installation_ns_oscar_i/,OPV Installation [NS Oscar I],"Here is a little walkthrough of my installation of an OPV in my Oscar! It was probably more hassle than it was worth on this old, cheap machine, but enjoyed the process and learned a lot on the way! I already had my lid off to replace a high limit temperature switch that had failed, which some extremely kind members of this sub helped me troubleshoot.

To begin, I ordered this kit from Coffee Addicts in Canada, who went over and above in assisting me to get the right parts. They only had a kit for the Oscar II in stock, so I had to get some extra fittings. Here is what came in the kit, just the valve, elbow barb fitting, some hose, and a tee adapter:

https://preview.redd.it/9xlg990awbwd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e645e20ce737be92fd58e4a64decc16e89c87a9

Here is the stock piping in the machine:

https://preview.redd.it/by4pb0tewbwd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6a3df9de590f73181fe7c0ef577634a5698fc63

In order to connect the pump outlet to the OPV, I used a small length of PTFE tubing and got a female 1/8"" BSP to 4/6mm compression barb fitting to connect the two. I had to pull the whole hose in order to attach it to the OPV properly, so took the chance to reinsulate it with some armaflex:

https://preview.redd.it/mtfhfon0xbwd1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73e2910dba2c89c377799282b7fa948fd63f0eae

Used as short a piece of hose as possible between the opv inlet and the fitting that attaches to the pump outlet, insulating that as well. Had to trim the long section of existing hose slightly to account for the length of the opv, and reattaching the outlet was difficult but got it done with some pliers:

https://preview.redd.it/8aj3c5r5xbwd1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d07c51c7346b1a4c57c3bd94e510764017eb0c1

May have mangled the end a bit but that's one slippery hose to try and fit over the compression barb fitting ""sleeve"".

On the other end I connected the tee fitting to the tank outlet, pump inlet, and opv “exhaust”:

https://preview.redd.it/ccl1qwgbxbwd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=967b7a0a13093e9fd5de5237dede163b62a8c6f4

This way the excess pressure is relieved back into the pump inlet along with fresh water from the tank. Bit of a tight work space getting everything attached, but it fits! 

Unfortunately I have a slight leak between the opv and the elbow fitting at the outlet. A couple drops every time I pull a shot. I might leave it as is for now unless it gets worse, because I don’t fancy disconnecting all three lines from the opv to remove it and redo that connection. I suspect it’s because I didn’t use a bushing/washer, as including the washer would have made the elbow fitting tighten to the wrong angle. This screenshot from elektros’ site shows it installed with the washer at the correct angle, I am not sure why mine didn’t end up like this:

https://preview.redd.it/b7cssdhmxbwd1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9444a492686cfbe3892448cec29d10097e14ba6b

I used some teflon tape on the threads but I might have to use a lot more to stop any leaks, or just stack multiple washers! 

Lastly I found some fittings to adapt a cheap aliexpress pressure gauge to my old portafilter (as I'm too cheap to buy a portafilter gauge) and tried to set the opv to 9 bar. Look away, plumbers:

https://preview.redd.it/kkeg5geqxbwd1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06aa76b98db92b648801d40a6b14108dc0831d78

This was difficult since the needle seemed to vibrate instead of holding still in one spot, I suspect that’s because this machine uses a cheap vibratory pump? 

Still dialling in my grind size but I definitely don’t have to grind as fine as I used to in order to get a 1:2 30 second shot! 

Here’s a shot photo for good measure:

https://preview.redd.it/ip1o7ctyxbwd1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0e1ab833095098283fa493ec4082b79c11d4997

Hope this walkthrough might help anyone who's in a similar boat, trying to keep their ancient machine working its best! 

Would love to hear any feedback, especially critiques on my plumbing skills!!

1g9ljm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_no20xd6/comments/1g9ljm2/ken_and_alyssa_at_miss_castillos_part_4/,"Ken and Alyssa at Miss Castillo's, Part 4","Miss Castillo sauntered into the living room, her skin still slick with the remnants of sweat and piss from their debauched play in the kitchen. Ken and Alyssa followed behind her, their naked bodies trembling, both spent yet unmistakably hungry for more. The room was thick with the musk of sex, their earlier release still lingering in the air.

Miss Castillo smirked as she reached for the box on the coffee table, pulling out a set of long, glistening anal beads and a hefty black strap-on that glinted ominously under the dim light. She turned to face them, eyes blazing with a wicked gleam. “You think you’re ready for this?” she teased, dangling the beads in front of Ken’s face, the thick rubber glistening. “Or is this too much for you?”

To her surprise, Ken’s lips curled into a sly grin, eyes dark with lust, but calm in a way that made Miss Castillo pause. Alyssa let out a breathy giggle, exchanging a knowing look with Ken. “We’ve done worse,” Alyssa murmured, her voice a sultry whisper.

Miss Castillo blinked, momentarily taken aback, a spark of intrigue flaring in her chest. “Is that so?” she asked, running her tongue over her lips as she stepped closer. The strap-on dangled from her hand, the weight of it thick and intimidating, but now, with this revelation, her control felt deliciously challenged.

Ken leaned forward slightly, licking her lips. ""You think you’re gonna shock us with a toy like that? We’ve used bigger.” She cast a quick glance at Alyssa, her smile growing bolder, more mischievous. ""We’ve *filled* each other up before.""

Alyssa chuckled, her breath quickening as she shifted her legs, fingers brushing over her thighs, clearly eager. ""Tell her about that time we—""

“No need,” Miss Castillo interrupted sharply, though her voice wavered ever so slightly, her own arousal mounting at the thought. She could feel the heat pooling between her legs, the sudden flush in her cheeks. “I’ll find out myself just how much you can handle.”

She moved with purpose now, stepping behind Ken and pressing the cool, slick beads against her ass, her fingers trailing over the sensitive skin. “Let’s see if you’re still as tough when I shove this inside you,” she purred into Ken’s ear, her voice dripping with challenge, teasing at the edge of cruelty. Ken moaned, arching her back slightly, her body ready for the next sensation.

Miss Castillo slid the first bead in slowly, watching as Ken’s muscles tightened, then relaxed, her breath hitching at the intrusion. Alyssa watched with wide eyes, her own hands wandering down between her legs as she bit her lip, the sight of her lover being filled sending ripples of arousal through her.

Ken grunted, her voice rough but steady. ""Yesss, teach. I love it.""

Miss Castillo chuckled softly, leaning down to kiss the back of Ken’s neck before pushing in another bead, then another, her fingers slick with Ken’s wetness. “Just wait, slut.”

Miss Castillo’s breath grew heavier, her chest rising and falling as she pressed the last bead deeper into Ken's ass. Ken’s body jerked, a guttural moan slipping from her lips as the sensation of being filled pushed her to the brink. Miss Castillo grinned wickedly, eyes glued to the way Ken’s body reacted, trembling and needy.

“God, you love that, don’t you?” Miss Castillo whispered, her voice sultry, dark, as she gave the string of beads a teasing tug. Ken whimpered, her body arching, ass rising higher like she was begging for more. “Such a dirty fucking slut, letting me fill your ass like this. Bet you’ve never had anyone do it this good, huh?”

Ken gasped, her eyes fluttering shut, her breath shaky. “Fuck… Miss Castillo…” she panted, her hips grinding against the air, desperate for more, anything more. ""I want it... give me more...""

Miss Castillo chuckled lowly, her lips curling into a smirk as she glanced over at Alyssa, who was watching with rapt attention, her fingers buried between her thighs as she rubbed herself shamelessly, eyes glazed with lust. ""Don't worry, baby,"" Miss Castillo cooed, voice dripping with condescension. ""Your turn's coming, too.""

Alyssa let out a whimper, her fingers moving faster, her breath coming in ragged pants. ""Please… Miss Castillo... I want you to use them on me too.""

“Oh, you filthy fucking whore,” Miss Castillo growled, pulling the beads out of Ken’s ass with a slow, agonizing drag, each bead popping out with a wet sound, leaving Ken panting, her body trembling. “You’re both such insatiable sluts.”

She wasted no time moving over to Alyssa, who was already lying on her back, legs spread wide, dripping wet and ready for whatever was coming. Miss Castillo knelt between her thighs, her fingers tracing Alyssa’s slick folds before pressing the tip of the first bead against her tight asshole.

Alyssa let out a strangled moan, her body jolting at the intrusion, her hips lifting off the ground as Miss Castillo pushed the bead in slowly, savoring the way Alyssa squirmed beneath her touch. ""Fuck, you're tight,"" Miss Castillo breathed, her free hand sliding up Alyssa’s trembling thigh, fingers brushing over her soaked cunt. “You must have been dreaming about this, huh? Getting your ass stuffed while your pussy drips for me?”

Alyssa’s head fell back, her eyes rolling as she groaned, her back arching as Miss Castillo slid another bead inside her, then another, each one making Alyssa’s moans louder, more desperate. “Yes, yes, fuck, I’ve wanted this... wanted you to use me...”

Miss Castillo’s eyes darkened with lust, and she leaned forward, her mouth latching onto Alyssa’s foot, her tongue flicking over Alyssa’s toes, sucking them into her mouth as she pushed the beads deeper, enjoying the filthy sounds spilling from Alyssa’s lips.

Alyssa gasped, her body trembling violently, her toes curling in Miss Castillo’s mouth as she sucked, teasing her, filthy words spilling from her lips between licks. ""You taste like a fucking slut,"" Miss Castillo groaned around Alyssa's toes, her voice thick with arousal, her fingers gripping Alyssa’s thigh harder as she pushed another bead inside her ass. “A dirty little whore who loves getting her ass stuffed, huh? Who loves it when I suck on these filthy fucking feet?”

“Yes, oh fuck—yes!” Alyssa cried out, her hands tangling in her own hair, her legs quivering as Miss Castillo’s mouth worked magic on her toes, teeth scraping against the sensitive skin, her tongue swirling in maddening circles. “I’m your slut! Fuck, Miss Castillo... don’t stop…”

Ken, still trembling from her own experience, crawled closer, her breath hot on Miss Castillo’s neck as she whispered, “You’re so fucking good at this. I didn’t know... you were such a fucking pro.”

Miss Castillo chuckled darkly, pulling back just enough to look at Ken. “Oh, you’ve got no idea how much fun I’m about to have with you two.” She smirked, glancing down at Alyssa, who was writhing on the floor, beads buried deep inside her ass, toes wet from Miss Castillo’s mouth. “You’re going to be begging for more before I’m done with you. Every. Fucking. Inch.”

Alyssa’s breath hitched as Miss Castillo gave the beads a sharp tug, not enough to pull them out, just enough to send a shock of pleasure through her body. Her moans turned desperate, her hands grasping at the floor, her pussy drenched and throbbing. “Please, fuck, I need you... need you to use me more…”

Miss Castillo grinned, her hand trailing down Alyssa’s trembling leg, lips brushing over her soaked folds before she murmured, ""I’m going to fuck you until you can’t remember your name, you dirty little whore.""

Miss Castillo’s smirk deepened as she caught the desperate, filthy need on Alyssa’s face. Without warning, her fingers clenched around the string of beads and, with a brutal yank, she pulled them out of Alyssa’s ass all at once. Alyssa’s scream was immediate, raw and guttural, her back arching off the floor as her body convulsed, every nerve ending lighting up in blinding ecstasy.

At the same time, Ken moved swiftly, straddling Alyssa’s face, her slick pussy dripping down onto Alyssa’s eager lips. Alyssa’s moans were muffled, her tongue instantly darting out to lap at Ken’s folds, her hips bucking uncontrollably as her orgasm tore through her body like a storm.

“Fuck yes,” Ken groaned, grinding her hips down, smothering Alyssa’s face with her dripping cunt. “Lick me, bitch... fuck, Alyssa, eat me out while you’re cumming…”

Miss Castillo’s eyes darkened with satisfaction, watching the filthy display beneath her. Alyssa’s hands gripped Ken’s thick thighs, her mouth working frantically, sucking and licking like a desperate whore, even as her own body shook with the aftershocks of her orgasm. Her entire body was a mess of sweat, cum, and need.

“Oh my god,” Ken whimpered, her fingers twisting into Alyssa’s hair, pulling her deeper into her slick heat, her hips bucking wildly. “Alyssa, I’m gonna fucking cum all over your face... fuck... just like that.”

The room filled with their moans, Alyssa’s muffled whimpers beneath Ken, and Miss Castillo’s low, satisfied laughter. She leaned over Ken, her hands sliding up her sides before cupping Ken’s huge tits, squeezing them roughly, her thumbs brushing over the sensitive nipples. Ken gasped, her body trembling under the touch, her eyes squeezing shut as her tits were groped and teased.

“You’ve got such fucking perfect tits, Ken,” Miss Castillo murmured, her breath hot against Ken’s neck as she pinched her nipples hard, drawing another moan from her. “Bet you love when I play with them, huh? You filthy fucking slut, getting off from this.”

Ken was trembling, her tits aching with pleasure as Miss Castillo’s fingers worked her nipples, pinching and tugging with cruel precision. “Yes... fuck, yes... I love it, Miss Castillo, don’t stop.”

Miss Castillo grinned, her fingers still torturing Ken’s nipples, her eyes gleaming with hunger. “I’m not done with either of you yet.”

Without another word, Miss Castillo slid down Alyssa’s body, her hands parting her trembling ass cheeks, revealing Alyssa’s tight, still throbbing hole. Miss Castillo wasted no time, her tongue darting out to lap at Alyssa’s slick, sweaty skin, burying her face between Alyssa’s perfect, round ass cheeks. Alyssa moaned into Ken’s cunt, her legs trembling uncontrollably as Miss Castillo’s tongue probed her asshole, licking and sucking with a dirty enthusiasm that had Alyssa’s body shaking with overstimulation.

“Oh fuck, oh fuck—” Alyssa whimpered, her hips jerking, her mouth still working feverishly against Ken’s pussy. She could barely think, her body drowning in sensation, her ass clenching around Miss Castillo’s wicked tongue.

Miss Castillo moaned against Alyssa’s skin, her fingers slipping between Ken’s legs, finding her soaking wet pussy and plunging two fingers deep inside her without warning. Ken let out a strangled cry, her hips slamming down onto Alyssa’s face as Miss Castillo finger-fucked her with relentless force.

“Fuck, Miss Castillo, oh god—” Ken’s voice was high, breathless, her tits bouncing with each thrust of Miss Castillo’s fingers. She was close, teetering on the edge, her body writhing with need. Alyssa’s mouth worked furiously beneath her, her tongue buried deep inside Ken’s dripping pussy.

I'll be heading to Thailand in November. Thailand's been on my list for decades, but my wife has been so it's never at the top of our list when we're traveling together. Since she'll be busy with work, this is my chance.

I'll start off by spending 2 nights in Bangkok at Capella. My primary goals of Bangkok are eating good street food in Chinatown and other street food markets, seeing a Muay Thai fight, and maybe getting some custom shirts made. 

Next I'll be going to Chiang Mai, staying at Anantara. The timing overlaps with the Loy Krathong and Yi Peng Festivals, which could be fun to check out. Other than that, lots of street food and exploring the city. I plan on renting a scooter/small motorcycle to explore outside of the touristy zone. But other than that, I haven't developed a full itinerary yet. Would love some suggestions. My goal is really just to soak up the city and local culture. Sitting in a coffee shop and people watching while reading a book. Going to supermarkets where locals shop. That sort of thing. I'll be in Chiang Mai for about 5-6 days.

Then one last night in Bangkok staying at the Rosewood before heading home. Mostly returning to Bangkok for one night to break up the travel before heading home. 

Definitely open to suggestions of things to check out while I'm there!",2,1729612241.0,luxsolotravel,0,1.0,False

Is this possible, that the lounge staffs are asking people to download 3rd party app?","Is this possible, that the lounge staffs are asking people to download 3rd part app for lounge access and scamming in the Airport?

# Here's the news:

# A woman lost over Rs 87,000 while trying to get access to a lounge at the Bengaluru International Airport. She had downloaded an app called 'Lounge Pass'.

According to the woman, she had to board a flight on the day but had arrived at the airport five hours early. Following this, she felt like resting at an airport lounge while she waited for her flight. Since she did not have her physical credit card, she was asked to show its photograph to get an entry into the lounge.

After her credit card's photo was scanned, the lounge staff then instructed her to download an app called 'Lounge Pass'. She was also asked to complete a facial recognition process for security via screen sharing, which she found to be odd.

However, since she was tired, she did not pay much attention and downloaded the app and performed the security check anyway as told. Despite this, she didn't use the lounge and ended up grabbing a Starbucks coffee instead.

When she received her credit card statement, she was shocked to discover that over Rs 87,000 had been transferred to a PhonePe account. She believes that the scammers might have accessed her phone through the 'Lounge Pass' app, which enabled them to set up call forwarding and potentially intercept the one-time passwords (OTPs) to facilitate the unauthorised transactions.

The stomach pain will last for an hour after and I just feel so tired and defeated. My stomach, on the left side, feels slightly uncomfortable, almost like a vibration. 

It is making it difficult to work. I will make some toast or eat an egg with a banana. I then start to feel better and start to feel normal. No more bowel movements till the next day. 

Any thoughts as to what might be causing this? I take a Tylenol pm almost every night. This is to help with joint pain and sleep. Not great to do I know. I hope to break the habit.

My daughter (23) decided to take a break from her last year of college, couldn’t afford rent and just needed a mental health break so she moved from Texas to our home in New England and brought her boyfriend (27) with our permission to live with us. She made him sound really great and he loved our homestead lifestyle and was eager and excited to lend a hand. I didn’t want to force marriage on them so I welcomed them to live with us while they get their lives back on track.

For 4 months he has lived rent free, driven my daughters car, happily eaten the meals I’ve cooked, gone on fun day trips and restaurants with us that we’ve paid for and basically done hardly anything in return. We have asked him for help, he says ok but days go by and he never does anything. He works early mornings part time in a coffee shop and then sits home the rest of the day playing video games in his room and ordering DoorDash. My daughter is working full time at a restaurant and when she comes home she bring him up food to their room I’ve cooked. Most days he won’t even come down.

We’ve politely asked him to do a few things to help us and so has my daughter but in the last 4 months of living here he has mowed the lawn twice on a riding lawn mower and managed to do such a bad job my daughter and I started doing it. 

He never brings down his dirty dishes, my daughter does his laundry, and he’s just a leach on our family.

George steals items from Goodwill donation bins and sells them on Facebook marketplace. Kramer walks backwards everywhere because it burns more calories.,"Newman goes viral after he's caught on a doorbell camera scratching his butt and sniffing his fingers. George steals items from Goodwill donation bins and sells them on Facebook marketplace. Kramer hasn't had a date in months and decides to lose some weight. His friend Bob Sacamano suggests that he walk backwards everywhere because it burns more calories. Jerry's date cancels on him due to pinkeye. 

Elaine is upset because they were supposed to join her and Peterman at the Yo-yo ma concert. Jerry invites the K-man instead. As Peterman is standing out front of Carnegie Hall, Kramer bumps into him as he's walking backwards. Peterman shouts, ""what in aunt Debbie's beard are you doing man?"" Kramer responds, ""exercising, what are you doing?"" After the concert, Peterman instructs Elaine to create a clothing line made specifically for backwards walking.

George and Jerry are watching the Yankees play the Dodgers when a joint public service announcement is broadcast on behalf of the department of health and the U.S postal service. The viral video of Newman is played and the public is informed that postal employee Newman will be on paid leave pending investigation. George snaps his fingers multiple times and points at Jerry, ""where did you say your girlfriend lived again?""

""She's in a building over on West 86th street, why?""

""Well, isn't Newman's route on the upper west side?""

Jerry shouts, ""Newman!"" as he clenches his fist. 

George unwittingly makes a sale of clothing to Newman's new girlfriend, who was amused at the fact that he'd caused a pinkeye epidemic on his route. 

To avoid further disgrace, Newman walks backwards as he approaches large groups of pedestrians. This behavior piques no curiosity, as the trend is spreading rapidly. Newman arrives at his girlfriends and is greeted with puffy, bloodshot eyes. His sympathetic nervous system choses flight and his muscle memory causes him to run two blocks backwards. His now ex girlfriend was only having an allergic reaction to the blood hound hairs on the clothing she bought from George. The clothes had belonged to a lady that works for the Animal Care Centers of NYC.

Peterman gets sued by Jermaine Dupri for copyright infringement. He claims his backwards clothing line was patented with Kris Kross in 1992. Peterman is forced to sell the company and George finds Elaine a job at Yankee stadium. Elaine catches George drinking water from the dehumidifier machine in the lunch room. George exclaims, ""the water cooler is busted and I refuse to walk half a mile to the next one. And I'm not paying $3 for a bottle of water baby!""

Kramer spots an ACC mobile pet adoption event while out exercising and stops to pet some dogs. He compliments the driver of the truck on her stunning attire. ""Thank you, I've recently replaced my entire wardrobe."" She's so flattered and simultaneously intrigued by Kramer's backwards tracksuit that she invites him over for coffee after work.

https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/10/comic-sans-debate/680319/

On the morning of July 4, 2012, two big headlines came from CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Geneva. The first was that the Italian physicist Fabiola Gianotti had made a significant discovery in quantum field theory. The second was that her PowerPoint presentation about it had been delivered in Comic Sans. Hilarity competed with outrage: Critics argued that Comic Sans was a font for children’s-party invitations, with a promise of fun and games. It was not meant for important developments in particle mass. Lisa Randall, the first tenured female theoretical-physics professor at Harvard, emailed Gianotti with congratulations and the question on everybody’s mind: Why Comic Sans? “Because I like it,” Gianotti replied.

Comic Sans has long been the “Macarena” of fonts. Type aficionados don’t like it, the way coffee connoisseurs don’t like Starbucks. It is the font everyone loves to hate. But I love to love it. More than the typeface itself, I love the idea of Comic Sans: a set of letters that can make people suddenly intrigued, and sometimes cross. No other font gets people so worked up.

We had Saturday only tickets, the Sprint, Qually and Eminem was too good of a day, we bought them a few weeks before the event and were around $400 each (On the second hand market)    
  
**Transport** 

Lots of talk on this but all I can say is the shuttles were an absolute dream, we walked from our AirBnB (about 40 mins) to the downtown shuttle, enjoyed grabbing some coffee and food en route! We got to the shuttle around 9.15 and we walked straight onto a bus and then took just under 30 mins to get to COTA. 

**Seats**

I think this is the sweet spot, first off I've no doubt we picked the best spot on the track, Turn 15. You get views of the back straight then 3 corners where there's lots of action. We went for slightly higher row seats (Row 23) to clear the chain fence and I couldn't have hoped for a better view of the action. 

**Weather**

Being of pale Irish heritage, the sun here in Austin was a huge concern, what I didn't realize was the seats we have gave us access to a number of 'PSL Lounges' these were an absolute god send between races / events. It allowed us to grab a beer and relax in relative cool. Apparently it was cool compared to previous years!

**Food & Drink**

As expected, food and drink was pricey, we had some of the greek food (The lines for all the food places were pretty wild), portions were small, I'd take snacks with me if we come again. Security didn't care on the way in). 

The PSL lounges and the Event Info stands gave out free electrolytes and suncream if you'd forgotten it. 

**Bridges**

The bridges are a bottleneck all day, if you can find another route, do so, we looped most of the track and went the reverse way to avoid the bridge queues. 

**Gig**

As soon as Qually was over, us and everyone else (ha). Headed for the stage space, this was just a case of being patient and walking over, it took about 45 mins but we had plenty of time ahead of the gig. Gig was great, cant say we are super fans but we enjoyed it. We left about 20 mins before the end and again walked straight onto a bus and was back in downtown 40 mins later.

**Summary**

All in all this was a really great event, but having the seats and the lounges feels like a must (Given how much we would struggle in the sun), the shuttles were easy and highly recommend them, take snacks and some water but expect to pay for more (Free water was often warm and huge lines). Try and head into the circuit, most people seem to queue for stuff at the entry point but the same stalls and info is available all over the track. Staff were generally unhelpful, and didn't really know more than we did in terms of where to go etc but it felt like everything was well sign posted. Our favorite spot between races was the PSL Lounge up near turn 1, got a great view of the pits and for some reason this lounge (Which was basically a tent) was pretty quiet. 

I think it was incredible value for money given the sprint, qually and gig! Any specific questions, more than happy to answer! ",7,1729611658.0,CircuitOfTheAmericas,2,1.0,False

","I am finding wildly different answers on this and am curious about experiences you have had. I got COVID for my first time ever about 3 months ago, thought I had recovered but then 2 weeks later I passed out in a hot coffee shop and have been lightheaded and just not feeling good nearly every day since. So, coming up on 3 months with this issue.  I do have the classic case of resting heart rate jumping up 50'ish BPMs when standing up. 

The question is, should I try to exercise (short walks mostly), or do I just rest? I know I should ask my doctor, but the problem is I've been to a GP (labs) and to a neurologist (MRI, EEG, etc) and am kind of getting nowhere. I'm not getting any answers as to if this is long COVID that will subside, or, is this going to be my new norm. 

I've read articles that say getting some exercise is good, others that say maybe you shouldn't. Most days, I have been taking 20 min walks in the mornings when it's cool out, I've also taken up yoga most days, and perhaps another short walk in the evening. I'm in a pretty constant state of light headedness and I do notice it gets a bit worse after doing activity, but, if that's just how it goes because of the motion I can understand that. 

  
It's hard to just not exercise. I've stopped lifting weights and going to the gym and I just really don't want to get out of shape and unhealthy.

2. Free bus pass if possible- ride/scooter, park and ride- save $50 a week on gas/parking

3. Collaborate- spend time chatting up people in the office, prove it kills productivity to management

4. Take breaks and walks- do not sit all day in cube. We get 2x breaks and 30 minute lunch

So I(18M) and her (18F) have been going to the same class in college for 3 months already and then one day( around a month ago) she wrote me in DM about the class material.

I gave her advice / helped her because I think I understood material well.  Then it continued and we began exchange messages about different things, mostly about the class but personal stuff as well. Conversations were quite fun and enjoyable.

Then ( I think I am kinda an idiot for that ) I did not approach her in any way IRL, until she started saying hello, waving and smiling ( I think a very genuine and sweet one) to me each time we had class and I always responded.  She doesn't seem like a very sociable girl but almost always smiles to me. 

Then some time after that she told me how a guy approached her, complimented her, asked her insta, she gave it and that guy then said they had an age gap(she is a undergrad freshman and he was from her words MA) so it didn't evolve to sth. I said it is so nice and wished her good luck to find sb else.

I didn't pay any attention to all of this until a few days ago it dawned on me how sweet her smile is. It sounds very strange I think but then I  hesitated a lot but then asked her for a coffee tomorrow and she agreed.

 Is she just being nice/friendly/ tries to find a friend or she might like me? I now started to really like her, but I am heavily afraid that she is just a nice girl who wants sb to talk to, but  I like her.
I will try to understand it when we meet, but can you give your opinions please?

Besides, would you consider a guy asking you to have a coffee with you a date or just he wants to talk to you?

Therefore I can't go to bars or do fully ""adult"" things yet. I also do not have a full drivers license nor a car so I am stuck where I am for the time being, before anyone suggests I get out more 😂 I should also clarify that I have no issues on putting myself out there or being ""social''I just don't have the skills needed to make actual connections 

I've been alone for as long as I can remember, I've never had many friends, I've had a few relationships but never a group of friends. This has never bothered me too much previously, being alone was fine. I could do what I wanted without needing input and never had plans outside of work so I had plenty of free time.

That was my life for years, even before I was old enough to work I was home schooled and often spent my time studying or watching movies to keep myself entertained. It never bothered me before, but I've noticed recently that I'm starting to feel lonely. I don't exactly keep friends well, I'm an out of sight out of mind person and it's not fair for someone to have to always text or call first because I can't remember they exist unless I see them (gotta love adhd.) and I also lack the social skills and knowledge on social cues necessary for friendships. While I am working on those issues,  I am still not ready for the responsiblity and social aspect of being a friend.

However, as I go through the motions I'm starting to feel sad doing things I once enjoyed doing alone, like going out window shopping or going to get coffee in a cafe and just sit in silence. Things that I was once ok with doing alone just seems boring now. 

I'm not exactly looking for advice to find friends, because let's be real- I'm in a small town and everyone my age is already close knit and not taking new people,  and people I do find are often too old to be friends with an 18yr old even if we have insightful discussions- and plus, for my own comfort I don't prefer it. I'm looking for advice on how to go back to enjoying being alone.

I wouldn't say it's depression, all other areas of my life are fine- if not better, I'm getting back into hobbies I once enjoyed and I'm living my best life in all other aspects aside from friendship. I imagine this is something that can be easily fixed with some mind reframing so I'm hoping people here can help. 

Direct questions I'm wanting answers to:

How did you feel at peace with being alone again if you have ever felt a tinge of loneliness?

How did you prevent the loneliness from coming back?

I live in a 2Bed 2Bath Grad fully furnished unit at Cullen Oaks, which is on campus. Even though this is student housing, you do NOT have to buy a meal plan. Rent is $1349 and includes utilities. I am offering $250 to anybody who takes my lease right now! 

The Grad refers to the fact that it is fully furnished and comes with a washer and dryer inside the apartment as opposed to having to share one with others. Additionally, there are only 6 Grad Units in the entire apartment complex.

The apartment comes with a couch, dining room table, 3 coffee-like tables in the living room, and in the room, it comes with a dresser, study desk, and a twin xl bed and mattress. 

I live in room B. Unlike my A, room B has the bathroom connected to the room and is much bigger! 

I live with one girl and she’s super sweet and chill! She is usually out majority of the day at work or school, so the place is pretty quiet; if you like having your own space, this is perfect! 

Cullen Oaks has its own 24/7 gym and study center with access to computers and a printer.

Badly need to vent this out but I tried posting on another sub pero ayaw mag appear huhu anyway..

Met someone online, we never intended it to be more than just casual hangouts. At first, nagstay lang kaming anon. We didn’t even know each other’s real names and it went like that for quite awhile. But then one thing led to another. Our relationship got deep and we slowly revealed our real selves as it was happening.

There was a lot of back and forth at first because I wasn’t really looking for a relationship but at the same time, I was catching feelings. I tried to push him away multiple times but he never wavered. In the end, we decided to commit to each other than fool ourselves being in a “situationship”. 

The thing is, during our official first month, i discovered that he lied to me so much during our getting to know phase. He lied about his age (sabi niya 1 yr older lang siya sakin, yun pala we have a 9 year age gap. I’m 28F btw), how long his and his long term ex have broken up. Turns out when he started talking to me, he said it was over for 8 months pero halos 2 months palang pala. Yung mga lies na to, i let it slide bcs of how we met and started, kasi nga wala naman kaming obligation to be honest then dahil it was a casual safe for work anon meet up. We didn’t even exchange pictures and it was just purely about having company over coffee. Yung explanation niya sakin is hindi naman daw niya inakala na aabot sa magkaka feelings siya sakin at dumating na siya sa point of no return and he was balls deep in his lies. 

He eventually admitted to everything din naman when I caught him spending time with his ex’s mom na sabi niya blood relative niya daw. Yung reason niya sakin is hindi niya lang daw malet go yung bond niya sa family ex niya kasi parang second mom niya na yun. Syempre nagalit ako kasi paano naman yung feelings ko? Sabi ko either sabihin mo sa mom ng ex mo na break na kayo ng ex mo or tayo nalang magbreak. He did it naman. How I discovered na hindi niya blood relative yung kasama niya is a story for another day. Btw, twice nya mineet yung family ng ex niya. Nung last ko lang siya nahuli. So sa middle ng confrontation na to, dun na niya sinabi yung about sa age niya etc bcs he wants to be honest na daw from then on. 

(PLS DON’T POST ON OTHER SOCIAL APPS)

But then yung sunod naman namin naging problem was involving his mismong ex niya na for 10 years-ish. After his birthday, I saw that his ex messaged him on facebook calling him their callsign. He deleted the message before I even had the chance to see it. Sabi nya lang binati siya and slight kamustahan. And it ended na daw. Idk if totoo ba na yun yung naging convo. But he swore na hindi na niya mahal yung ex niya and there’s no need to worry dahil di na daw siya kasama sa buhay nya ngayon with me.

We are now almost 8 months in since we first met, including 2 months officially being in a relationship.

After all that, we on the process of fixing things right now. He’s doing everything to reassure me na nagiging transparent na siya. He deleted his old facebook, made a new one and gave me the password, he always updates me, we even have a location app. I can feel naman his sincerity, mafefeel naman natin yun as girls.

We’re both willing to fix it naman. Di ko lang alam kung hanggang saan ba to at kung kaya pa ba or dapat pa ba.

In the mornings when I first get up (530am) I have Japanese practice (yes I’m learning Japanese), for about 15-30 minutes, check on our accounts and what not, get a shower, a coffee, give a kiss and hug to my husband and son as they head out to work and then often go in to work. (I work from home) 6pm, husband makes dinner on weekdays so dinner is on the table. We’re done with dinner by 7p and I’m in bed by 8p. Does anyone see a time slot I’m missing?

1g9kt7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCulture/comments/1g9kt7b/exploring_a_possible_subnarrative_in_consider/,Exploring A Possible Sub-Narrative in Consider Phlebas: A Newcomer’s Perspective,"

For a series about a post-singularity, post-scarcity, near-omnipotent civilization, you’d think we’d start from the perspective of someone inside the Culture. Yet in Consider Phlebas, we’re introduced to Horza the Changer, an individual actively fighting against the Culture. Nearly all discussions I’ve read talk about the book as only a subversion of traditional sci-fi tropes and not much more, but I believe there’s something deeper at play.

- Balveda and Horza’s Unusual Relationship

From the beginning, the relationship between Balveda and Horza feels unusual. They know each other as if they’ve crossed paths multiple times in various conflicts. I propose that this is not just a standard cat-and-mouse trope but hints at a more significant underlying narrative.

- Balveda’s Deeper Role As A Culture Agent

Balveda is a Special Circumstances agent—a division of the Culture responsible for handling delicate and complex situations. I suggest that she is, in fact, an envoy tasked with protecting an endangered sentient species: the Changers. This perspective turns coincidence into purpose and makes Balveda’s character more interesting and more tragic given what takes place.

- Horza Is Not Horza’s True Identity

Horza works for an Idiran spymaster. The Idirans, a militant and religious species, utilize what they consider “lesser species,” like the Medjel, to achieve their warfare objectives. Horza’s dream sequences imply that the Idirans have manipulated the Changers’ natural physiology to create shapeshifting agents of war. It’s hinted in Horza’s last dream sequence that the Changers are not merely under the Idirans’ influence but that many are raised and indoctrinated by them for espionage purposes. Given their ability to change form, the concept of identity becomes fluid—a trait that can be exploited by a dominant species like the Idirans.

Horza is unaware of this, but his subconscious mind is not. There are many factors I believe support this, but one of the most interesting is his subconscious fixation on the sentence his former Changer lover was fond of. The sentence talks about “hereditary assassins,” and Horza’s mind returns to this often. I believe it’s because his subconscious knows that is exactly what he is, not just because it connects him to his former lover.

While there isn’t explicit confirmation, I believe viewing the story through this lens makes the themes of identity even more impactful.

- Balveda’s Concern for Horza

Early in the book, Balveda attempts to prevent Horza’s execution, explaining that he is “one of the last of his kind.” Her somber frustration when Horza speaks about being on the side of “life” and disparages “thinking machines” indicates that she has an emotional investment in him. It reminds me of speaking to misinformed family members. If Balveda’s mission includes preserving the Changer species, her actions and statements throughout the story take on greater importance.

This also makes sense considering that the Culture is near omnipotent. They are going to easily win this war. She knows Horza is not just naive—he is a tragic character manipulated and warped, a product of Idiran disregard for “lesser species.”

- The War Is Trivial to the Culture

Our main understanding of the Culture comes from the “State of Play” chapters. These sections delve into the moral conflicts of a pleasure-seeking super-society searching for purpose in the universe. They also hint at how the Culture could easily win the war but chooses a more measured approach.

The central conflict in the book revolves around a lost Mind, which is revealed to be of little consequence to the overall war effort. Jase admits that losing the Mind might prolong the war by “a few months.” The humans within the Culture struggle to conceptualize the war and their role in it. Do they have the will to dominate the enemy, or can they find ways to “do good” and justify their involvement?

This is why Balveda is such an important character. Her actions throughout the book, culminating in her decision to self-euthanize reveal her as an embodiment of the Culture’s desire of doing good. When she awakens from cryo-sleep and learns that the Changers have become extinct, it underscores the futility and tragedy of her mission.

The main narrative ends with Balveda witnessing Horza’s flatlining. That feels very poignant to me.

- Conclusion

As someone new to Banks’s work, viewing the story through this lens makes it more impactful than my initial reading. It also makes Horza’s character an even more tragic figure. I feel like I could write an entire post about the deeper meanings we gain from viewing Horza, his relationships, his beliefs, and his actions in this light.

I’m curious to see if the subsequent books in the series contain similar subtle sub-narratives.

But maybe I’ve had too much coffee.

At first, I wasn’t sure if I liked the book. But anything that has me thinking this much about it is something I enjoy. Even if my hypotheses here are disproven, I believe if a story makes you think and build your own interpretation, the author has succeeded.",12,1729610670.0,TheCulture,11,1.0,False

Serena’s POV
Three days after talking to Attorney Marquez, my phone beeps with an email while I'm making coffee. I see his name and slowly open it.
""Divorce Proceedings: Initial Documents,"" I read to myself. ""Seems Bill is finally going to realize that I'm serious about ending our marriage.""
I grab the freshly printed divorce papers. Without a second thought, I call a cab, my hands slightly trembling as I lock the door behind me. I sit stiffly in the backseat, clutching the papers, my gaze fixed on the passing cityscape, silently rehearsing what I'll say to Bill.
As I enter Bill's office building, the lobby's luxury hits me immediately. The floor is polished marble, and there's soft lighting from modern fixtures overhead. There's a grand reception desk made of dark wood and glass, with well-dressed staff behind it.
It's been ages since I last set foot here. Then again, Bill never liked me coming over.
My attention is drawn to an elderly couple heading toward the exit. They're smiling while chatting animatedly. I can't help but overhear their conversation.
""Bill’s presentation was quite impressive,"" the woman says, her eyes sparkling. “He showed some great numbers and promising plans.”
""Yes, and the lady with him was really knowledgeable about their proposal. She was impressive and really pretty,"" the man remarks.
""I think she's Bill's wife. They're a great team. Kind of like how we used to be, George,"" the woman says with a smile.
Wife? I’m confused. How is Bill with his wife at that meeting when I'm right here? Wait, are they talking about another woman? Something's not right. I need to find Bill and figure this out.
I walk towards the receptionist, whom I don't recognize from my previous visits. She looks disinterested and somewhat rude as I approach.
""Excuse me. Is Bill Richardson around?"" I ask.
The receptionist's eyes narrow as I approach. Her eyebrows go up, making me feel uneasy. ""Do you have an appointment with him?"" she asks, her voice sharp.
""No, but I'm his wife,"" I reply. I can feel my eyebrows knit together in annoyance, and there's a tightness in my jaw as I speak. The receptionist's attitude is getting to me more than I'd like to admit.
I cut off the receptionist before she could make a snide comment, turning swiftly towards Bill's office.
""Wait!"" she yells, taken aback by my sudden move.
Ignoring her, I speed up, my sprained knee holding up well today. The sound of her calling security echoes behind me, but I'm focused on getting to Bill's office as fast as I can, not letting anyone stop me.
As I rush away from the security guards, Sarah, Bill's assistant, sees me. She's always been nice. ""Mrs. Richardson, what's wrong?"" she asks. Her eyes are full of concern as she tries to figure out why I'm in such a hurry.
“Where’s Bill? I need to talk to him.” I catch my breath as I reply.
Before I can say anything to Sarah, she notices the two security guards chasing after me. Her eyes go wide with shock. ""Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!"" she exclaims, placing her hand on her hip in a mix of anger and disbelief. ""This is our boss' wife. Do you want to get fired?""
They look embarrassed and one quickly apologizes, ""Sorry, Mrs. Richardson, we didn't know."" The other just nods.
Sarah's stern gaze doesn't waver as she addresses the guards. ""Get out of here before I tell Mr. Richardson what you did,"" she warns them. The security guards, now looking even more embarrassed, quickly turn and walk away.
After the guards leave, Sarah turns to me, her expression softening. ""Sorry about that,"" she says, sounding genuinely apologetic. ""Anyway, your husband’s in the conference room.""
""Thanks, Sarah,"" I say quickly, then head towards the conference room. I take a deep breath and hear Doris speaking.
Recalling the conversation of the old couple earlier, it hits me - they mistook Doris for Bill's wife. A mix of emotions wells up inside me, and without realizing it, I clench the papers in my hand, causing them to crumple slightly.
Without knocking, I stride into the conference room. I see Doris halting her presentation mid-sentence, her eyes landing on me with surprise. ""Serena? What are you doing here?"" she asks.
I quickly realize that the meeting is still in progress. Everyone's eyes turn towards me, wondering who the hell I am.
Bill swivels in his seat, his expression turning pale as he notices me. I keep my gaze fixed on him, the room's attention shifting. ""I, uh, need to talk to Bill,"" I say. ""It's about something urgent.""
Doris looks around the room and then back at me. ""We're kinda in the middle of something important here,"" she says.
I take a deep breath to steady myself and announce, ""Hello everyone, I'm Serena, Bill's wife."" There was a commotion after I said that. I heard someone whisper, “That’s Bill’s wife? I thought Doris was.”
""You heard it correctly. I’m Bill's wife, not Doris,"" I announce, trying to clear up the confusion. I turn towards Bill, expecting him to say something, but he just sits there, looking like he's seething with anger.
""Bill, why are you silent? It almost seems like you'd prefer Doris to be your wife, not me,"" I say.
Bill suddenly stands up and grabs my arm, leaning in to whisper, ""Not here, Serena. Don't embarrass me in front of everyone.""
He tries to pull me outside, but I quickly yank my arm away from his grip. At that moment, I don't notice Sarah coming in with coffee. My sudden movement causes me to bump into her, and the coffee spills all over me.
I feel the warmth of the spilled coffee seeping through my shirt, but it's the shock that's more overwhelming.
Doris exclaims with concern, ""Oh my gosh! Are you alright?""
She hurries over to me and pulls out a tissue from her purse, trying to dab at the coffee stains, but they don't come off easily.
Realizing it's not helping, Doris suggests, ""You know what, let's go to the break room so you can clean up properly."" Then she addresses the others, ""Let's take a quick break, everyone.”
I follow Doris into the break room, and as I do, memories from a previous dinner event flood back. It strikes me that whenever I end up embarrassed, Doris seems to be at the center of it.
Seriously, I'm so fed up with her bullshit.

However, I’m running into an issue that started after the machine prompted me to descale it.

I followed the descaling instructions exactly as directed, and everything seemed to finish successfully. Since then, the coffee/espresso part is still working perfectly, but the milk frother stopped functioning properly. Here’s what’s happening:

* When I try to use the frother, it blinks like it’s heating up/preparing as usual.
* Then it keeps flashing longer than normal.
* Suddenly, all 3 buttons and both LED lights flash in 3-burst pulses, and the machine shuts off after about 20-30 seconds.

I tried descaling again just to make sure, but no luck—same issue. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Any troubleshooting tips or things I could try on my own before I reach out to Nespresso?

He’s really clean cut and has the prettiest smile. I’ve noticed a lot about him, like what car he drives (no car seats in the back) and his coffee order, which is always coffee with a little cream. After about 3 months of seeing him, I finally decided to say hi. He was wearing a green polo, and I told him he looked great in it. He smiled, thanked me, and wished me a great day.

Even though he wasn’t wearing a ring, I had a feeling he might have a girlfriend or wife. Weeks went by, and yesterday he finally said good morning and asked how my Monday was going, probably because he saw me spill a bag of my breakfast outside. 😂 Our conversation wrapped up as we both left with our drinks. He asked if I worked nearby, and I said it was about 20 minutes away and he said he also works about 20 minutes away. I already knew he took the same freeway and exits couple exits before me, but I wasn’t about to be a creep and tell him that.

We took our oldest kid (4) and did the whole prep-and-drive-to-Media thing. Anyone with kids knows that leaving the house and going to a farm requires a lot of gear.

To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. Linvilla is busted. Here are a few of the issues:

- the playground is not maintained. 
- the ducks swam in a fecal chloroform pond which was comprised of the runoff of the chicken coops
- the six dollar train ride takes three loops around the parking lot where you can see piles of construction equipment and debris
- the food was tragic. The pizza was OK however, the turkey sandwich, fries, and coffee were all terrible.
- Bees were swarming by the garbage that was not emptied. We had a bee get stuck in our ketchup.
- the garden center was full of outdated products. It seems like their buyer hasn't worked in the last few years.

On the plus side, we got a great lemon pie that we took home and enjoyed. 

All in all, Linvilla has the potential to be amazing. It just seems that someone's dream was handed over and that dream has since died.

About three minutes away is an apple orchard called Indian Orchard. This was the second time that we went and we had a great experience.

It was going well, and I was interested, so I asked her out after about a day of talking. She said she'd love to, and seemed enthusiastic about it. 

I told her what days I'm typically free, and she said she's pretty busy throughout the week typically but would let me know if a day could work. She was also going out of town the coming weekend so obviously, I told her no pressure, we could figure something else out.

From there, the communication has gotten a little more sparse. She did message me once while she was gone to ask how my weekend was going, but that was it (and I appreciated it because I knew she was out of town and still thought to message me despite me having zero expectations of her doing that, which still just adds to my confusion)She got back from her trip last week, and I thought maybe she'd update me on when she'd be wanting to get together - but that didn't happen and hasn't happened. She didn't message me pretty much all of last week until really late on Friday our of nowhere, when she asked if I'd want to do coffee soon. So Saturday morning I respond saying yes. Then nothing the whole weekend until yesterday, when she ""liked"" my message where I said yes, but she didn't provide any other type of response.

At this point I'm wondering if I should even bother. I've never had this much difficulty trying to set up a date. I put forth the effort to ask her, and gave her my availability, and there hasn't really been anything much on her end, I feel. It just sucks because it felt like the conversation was going well and like I said she seemed enthusiastic. I can appreciate being busy, I have a busy schedule too. 

I guess my question is, at this point would you just cut your losses and assume this person either isn't as interested as you thought, or doesn't seem to have the time for dating, and move on?",1,1729610292.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

I confess that I have not been religious about cleaning and scaling, but this morning I measured the temperature of the espresso and it was only about 150 degrees F, so I think that the temperature may be part of the problem. It was the same regardless of whether I ran the ""cleaning"" program for a few seconds, and both times I had warmed the cup prior to brewing. Is it time to retire this one? If I do, I'm not sure that I'll buy another Nespresso, at least not a Vertuo model because I don't like being limited to the Nespresso capsules. I don't have the interest in making espresso manually, so whatever machine I get must be automatic or semi-. I have also even wondered if my taste buds have changed since having COVID about a year ago, and if that is the case, I don't want to spend a ton of money on a new device that I may not enjoy any more than this one since I'm the only coffee drinker in the house.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Forgot to add. They do have a few wait staff cleaning tables in each section, so we left a tip. Soft drinks and cold tea were $3, but I didn’t see any coffee or hot tea options, or even lemon. Maybe they were out, not sure.

From our experience we offer banquets with buffet-style an option at a much higher price per person depending on what all they want to see there, with less variety, and it's still a hit.

Miserable performances in all unfortunately, except for a min Cash in the Wynn $100,000k which was my first live tournament ever.  And Now I am on Hendon Mob with my little baby Min cash, tee hee. 

ANYWAY. 

In this tournament, something interesting happened.   After some guy who was clearly sick of playing punted his entire stack off to me, I was sitting in a healthy position with about 75bb. 

2 hands later, I'm in the BB.  Entire table folds, Old man coffee to my right is in the SB with about 30BB.  

I always look down at a player's chip stack as they go to grab chips, its just a habit.  I like to see if they grab more and put some back, or grab some but then decide to grab more, sometimes its a tell, sometimes not. 

Im in seat 6 and he is in seat 5.  When I look down, he is very careless with his cards and I see has KJo.  He raises about 3bb.  I look down at QQ.   I feel a bit torn at this moment because I know his cards.  I didn't mean to see them, I wasn't trying to see them, but I did.  

I consider for a moment telling the dealer but as the words come out of my mouth I feel like that would be dumb.  The dealer can't kill the hand or anything so why would I tell her?

So I make it 6BB and OMC calls. 

Flop comes Q T 5

OMC Jams. A horrible poker play in my opinion, but maybe he was sick of playing as well?  Anyway, I feel a little better knowing that this hand would have went down exactly the same why whether I saw his cards or not.  

But I am curious what you all do if/when there is a player being careless with their cards?

","I never thought I’d be the kind of person to fall for someone I couldn’t understand. But there’s something about mystery that pulls you in, and before you know it, you’re in too deep. That’s exactly what happened with Lila. I met her one rainy afternoon, under the awning of a little coffee shop I’d never noticed before.

It wasn’t supposed to be a memorable day. In fact, everything had been utterly ordinary. Work was the same dull routine; my boss had complained about the same things he always did. I went through the motions, and by 6 p.m., all I wanted was a quiet cup of coffee before heading home to my boring apartment.

I ducked into the coffee shop because it was pouring outside, and I hadn’t brought an umbrella. The place was almost empty, except for her. She sat by the window, looking out into the street, her fingers tracing the rim of a coffee cup that seemed to have gone cold a long time ago.

She was beautiful, in that classic, old-movie kind of way. There was something timeless about her. I didn’t want to stare, but it was hard not to. Something about her just drew me in. So, I ordered my coffee, and when the barista handed me my cup, I found myself walking over to her table, half expecting her to look up and tell me she was waiting for someone. Instead, she just smiled.

“I’ve been waiting for you,” she said.

It felt like a line out of some cheesy romance novel, but the way she said it, so calm and certain, made me freeze. I had no idea what to say. Had I met her before? Was she mistaking me for someone else?

“I’m sorry, do we—?”

“No,” she cut me off. “But we will.”

I couldn’t help but laugh, feeling a little thrown off but intrigued. I sat down across from her, and just like that, it felt like the most natural thing in the world. We talked for hours, about nothing and everything at once. I learned that she liked old records and rainy days. She told me she loved walking the city at night, when the streets were quiet and everyone else was asleep. But the weird thing was, she never talked about herself. Not really. She asked me a hundred questions, made me feel like I was the most interesting person in the world. But every time I tried to turn the conversation back to her, she’d change the subject.

By the time I realized how late it was, the rain had stopped, and the coffee shop was closing. We said goodbye, and as I watched her walk away, I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something more to her. Something just out of reach.

Over the next few weeks, I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I went back to that coffee shop every day, hoping I’d run into her again. And then, finally, on a Tuesday afternoon, there she was, sitting in the same spot by the window, her coffee untouched.

“I knew you’d come back,” she said when I sat down.

From that day on, it became a routine. We’d meet at the coffee shop, always in the late afternoon, always after the rain. We’d talk for hours, and then she’d disappear, never giving me her number or telling me where she lived. It was strange, but I didn’t care. I was falling for her. Hard.

But then, things started getting… weird.

One night, after one of our usual coffee dates, I decided to walk her home. It had been raining, of course, and the streets were slick with water, reflecting the dull glow of the streetlights. Lila walked beside me, silent for the first time since we’d met. She seemed distant, her eyes fixed ahead, like she was looking at something only she could see.

“Where do you live, anyway?” I asked, half-joking. “You never let me walk you home.”

She glanced at me, her smile fading slightly. “You wouldn’t understand.”

“What do you mean? Try me.”

She hesitated, biting her lip like she was trying to find the right words. “It’s not like where you live,” she said softly. “I can’t really explain it. I’m not… from here.”

1g9kf9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1g9kf9t/aita_for_calling_my_mil_a_bad_house_wife/,AITA for calling my MIL a bad house wife ,"I don't know where to turn to so I am turning to this. I called my MIL a bad house wife Infront of my husband and FIL. So a bit of back story. 

My hubby and I have been together for 4 years and married for 1and a half. His mom has never liked me and she can't give me a reason why even after I asked her. The smallest of things will set her off like when I was pregnant and the food she made triggered some nausea she almost went crazy. We have been living with them for about a year now and it has been a year of hell so far. 

In the past she has made house rules to suit her and when we played along with the rules she would get upset. My FIL works overseas and he comes home every few weeks. She does not clean the house before he comes home (and I mean their living area and their bedroom) when he is here she does not wash his clothes or hangs them. We had a rule in the house (her idea) that three times a week she makes food and them the rest of the week it is me and when you make food you have to clean the kitchen. 

The three days she makes food, she leaves the dishes in the sink until the morning of my day or she would ask my husband to clean the dishes before I start cooking. After a while she just stopped doing the dishes on her nights and my hubby and I had to clean the kitchen everyday. I talked to her about it because she would ask us to clean before her days begins and we agreed to keep to the house rule. 

FIL's last rotation came around and now he is home for good. They don't really talk to each other or even eat dinner together. On a grocery run I made with her, she told me that FIL is very unhappy with her because the house is always messy and she doesn't do his laundry but she told him that she will not be his cleaner and he can do it himself. 

The newest thing and the final straw for me was she started a diet recently and decided that she will only be making food for herself and I need to make food for the rest of the house. She will only be cleaning her own dishes. But she never does. She would leave her dishes in the sink until my hubby washes them or she would pick out her things from the full sink and was them. I decided that I would start doing the same as I am not the wife of this house. I started only cleaning my things and hubby's things and I could see it really bothered her. Then she started leaving all her dishes on the drying wrack for days until I ask her to pack them away. 

During the day I would be the one that offers to make my FIL a cup of coffee or something to eat as she just makes for herself. 

A few nights ago she was complaining about something my FIL did and I guess I just snapped. I said to her that she is a bad housewife because her job is to take care of her husband and she refuses to do that. 
Everything and everyone was silent for a few minutes and she just left the kitchen. So AITA?",5,1729609707.0,AmItheAsshole,75,0.56,False

First post! I'll be interviewing [Dr. Shaily Patel](https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-religion-and-culture/faculty/shaily-patel.html), an assistant professor of Early Christianity at Virginia Tech, for my podcast [Church Coffee](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/church-coffee-christianity-conservatism-and-culture/id1556894520) about the Historical Jesus. What questions would you have for her (make sure to take a look at her ""Principle Areas of Research Focus"" and ""Publications"" to get a sense of what might be some good questions).

Here's the broad outline that I'll be asking her:

* How do you take your coffee (or other caffeinated beverage)?
* What is your story? Tell us a little bit about your personal history.
* What drew you to the study of Early Christianity?
* What is the state of Historical Jesus Studies today?
   * What sources do scholars work with when doing research on a 2,000-year-old figure?
      * The Gospels, obviously; but which one is considered the ""most"" historical? Asked another way, what Gospel do acamedics most use when doing work on the Historical Jesus?
      * The Gospels, over time, have been viewed as religious novels, historical dramas, mythology, and even memoranda; but now, there seems to be a consensus that the Gospels are ancient Greco-Roman biographies - albeit in a modified religious format. Who first put forth the evidence of that, and how did this consensus solidify?
      * What other sources are used for doing research on the Historical Jesus: NT writings, Early Church Father epistles, Roman or Jewish historians, general writings/letters, etc? Which of these are considered ""most"" reliable?
      * Are apocryphal texts, like the *Gospel of Thomas* or *Protoevangelium of James* or *Apocryphone of John*, used at all for research into the Historical Jesus? How do they differ from the Canonical Gospels?
      * Explain the Q Source: it's hypothetical history, reconstruction, and is it historically verifiable?
   * What are the ""hypotheses"" in academia on who Jesus ""was:"" sage, revolutionary, apocalyptic prophet, messiah and/or divine? Does any of those have a ""consensus,"" or are they all equally competing, somewhat?
   * What is on the horizon or cutting-edge for Historical Jesus research?
* General QnA
   * Jesus is recounted doing miracles throughout the Gospels, which lead to a variety of actions: people believing, Pharisees accusing Him of ""\[having\] Beelzebub"" (Mk. 3:22, NRSVue), to people being scared (Mt. 8:34). Why were reactions so mixed (from a cultural and histo-critical view point)?
   * Jesus constantly interacts with demons throughout His ministry. In what ways did the Ancient Jews & Greco-Romans in Galilee & Judea literally view such spirits at that time? Asked another way: we in the West have a very particular vision of a demon (red, horns, spiked tail, etc), how would've Jesus's cultural milieu thought a demon looked?
      * How did the Ancient Jews practice exorcism vs. their Greco-Roman counterparts?
      * And what do secular academics make of Jesus's ""demon"" stories today?
   * Who were the ""magi"" in Matthew's nativity story? Why are they only mentioned in Matthew, and not found in Luke's recounting of the Nativity? If Apostolic and Early Christians were so against ""pagan"" ""magic,"" why are these guys not only included but even somewhat revered?
   * You specialize in magic and Early Christianity.
      * How is ""magic"" defined in the Old Testament? 
      * How is it defined in the New Testament? Were Jesus and the Apostles' miracles seen as ""magic,"" either to the Jews or the Greco-Romans?
      * How was it defined and seen in the first few centuries of Christianity - from Paul & the Didache to Augustine, and did that definition depend on place (Judea/Galilee, vs. wider Mediterranean)?
* Jesus Mythicism
   * What is meant by the term ""Jesus Mythicism?""
   * Can you point to any Western, secular scholar working at an academic institution in the field of ancient history, religious studies, or classics that forwards the claim that Jesus did not exist (particularly thinking of this [Ehrman clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mDuIN5-ww&t=1s))? For example, I see you are a member of both the *American Academia of Religion* and *Society for Biblical Literature*, do you know anyone at those institutions who put forth scholarly work that Jesus did not exist? Or are they so rare that they basically don't exist?
   * Have you heard of *any* secular scholar working at an western academic institution in *any* field that defends a claim of Jesus not consisting?
   * Are there any Mythicist arguments that are worth considering? 
   * Mythicists and even lay people tend to put forth lines of attack like: no archeological evidence of Him, no writings by Him, writings about Him appear ""late"" and those writings are religious so they can't be trusted, all writings are copied so hard to trust, the Bible was written/chosen by bishops at Nicaea, etc. How would you respond to some or all of those claims?
* What are some other resources you'd recommend for a lay person to read about the Historical Jesus? \[I generally point people to Brant Pitre's *The Case for Jesus*, Ehrman's *Did Jesus Exist?*, and Tim O'Neill's [History for Atheists](https://historyforatheists.com/jesus-mythicism/)\]
* What's next for you? Are you working on a book, applying for a tenure-track position, etc?",5,1729609589.0,AcademicBiblical,1,1.0,False

I know it's mostly water due to depletion of glycogen stores yesterday, but some of that is body fat. It's so much easier to move around. I can roll over in bed easier. I can get up from the chair without needing a strategy first. I just got up from my recliner before sitting at the PC desk and I don't remember it at all.  I just got up and went!  

I am planning to continue with this fast until Saturday morning, and will make some bone broth before then, so I can break my fast gently.  I have been following a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, and typically eating 2 meals a day. My dinner Sunday night was from a restaurant: smothered chicken, yams with andouille sausage, cornbread, and pudding. I ended up eating 2/3 of the chicken, all of the cornbread, 1/2 of the yams, and 1/2 of the pudding. The rest went to hubby and the dogs. I stopped eating each thing when I felt satisfied. 

Bread is a thing that I don't get full of. It is something I need to approach with portion control. The other things I ate to satiety and stopped. What a blessing to be able to stop eating when full, and to even have the sensation of feeling full.

Feeling full is something you get from hormones and from stretch receptors in the stomach. I don't know if my stomach reduced in size due to fasting. I think I'll hop over to the fasting sub and ask them what they know about it.

1g9k8ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1g9k8ol/sixteen_tons/,Sixteen Tons,"“What’s got you in such a sour mood, Brandon? It’s payday!” my veteran colleague Vinson asked as the rusty freight elevator noisily rattled its way up towards the penthouse suite.

For the past year or two – I’m honestly not sure how long it’s been, actually – I’ve been under contract for an otherworldly masked Lord who calls himself Ignazio di Incognauta. He’s not a demon, exactly. He’s closer to Fae, I think, but I don’t fully understand what he is. I never sought him out. He came to me. I asked him how he even knew who I was, and he slapped me across the face for my insolence.

I still signed up though. That’s how desperate I was. He doesn’t waste his time offering deals to people who can say no.

He sends me and the rest of my crew out on what I can best describe as odd jobs. Half the time – hell, most of the time – I’m not even sure exactly what it is we’re doing. Most of the crew have been around longer than I have, and some of them aren’t human, but they all seem to have a better idea of what’s going on than me.

Our foreman Vothstag is technically the one in charge, but he’s not all there in the head; the top of his cranium’s been removed and a good chunk of his brain’s been scooped out. He mostly just barks guttural nonsense that none of us really understand, but somehow compels us to do what we’re supposed to, even when we don’t know what that is. He’s a hulking hunchback with an overgrown beard who usually wears an elk skull to cover up the hole in his head. If he was ever human, I don’t think he is now.

Vinson is our *de facto* leader, however, since he’s more or less a normal guy that we can relate to. Aside from Vothstag, he’s been working for Ignazio the longest. I won’t bother describing what he looks like, since the rest of us wear gas masks on duty. They’re partially to protect us from environmental and workplace hazards, partially to conceal our identities, but mainly to bring us more easily under Ignazio’s control.

That was why were all wearing our masks on the elevator, incidentally. We were on our way to see the big boss, and our contracts made it very clear we were never to remove our masks in his presence.  

“Come on, Vinson. You know meetings with Iggy never go well,” I replied bluntly.

“Oh, it’s just bluster. You know that. He’s got to put the fear of God into us,” Vinson claimed. “If he wasn’t actually satisfied with our performance, we wouldn’t still be here.”

“No, Brandon’s right. Iggy wouldn’t have called all ten of us in just to hand us our scrip and call us lazy arses,” Loewald chimed in.

“There’s nine of us, now,” Klaus reminded him grimly.

“Right, sorry. Hard to keep track some days,” Loewald admitted. “Regardless; something’s up, and the odds are pretty slim it will be something we like.”

I cringed as Vothstag shouted some of his garbled nonsense back towards Loewald.

“Yes, I know we’re not being paid to have fun, but –”

“We’re not being paid at all!” Klaus interrupted. “None of us are getting any real money until our contracts are up, and have any of you actually known anyone who made it to the end of their contract?” 

He recoiled as Vothstag spun around and began roaring at him, hot spittle flying out from beneath his mask of carved bone as he furiously waved his fist in his face.

“He’s right, Klaus. You’re being paranoid,” Vinson said in an eerily calm tone. “I’ve served out multiple contracts, and I’ve got the silver to prove it.”

He confidently reached into his pocket and held a troy-ounce coin of Seelie Silver between his fingers. Fish and Chips, the pair of three-foot-tall… *somethings* that work for us immediately crowded around him and began eyeing it greedily.

“That’s right boys, take a gander. That’s powerful magic right there, and you’ll get one of these for every moon you’ve worked at the end of your contracts,” he reminded us before quickly pocketing the coin away again. “Unless, of course, you do something to get your contract prematurely terminated; then you’ll have nothing to show for it but a fistful of expired scrip! So keep your heads down, mouths shut, and your eyes on the prize. You’ll have pockets jangling full of coins soon enough.”

As discreetly as I could, I slipped my hands into my pockets and rubbed my one Seelie coin for good luck. None of them knew I had it, because I didn’t want to explain how I got it, but that little bit of fortune it brought me had almost been enough to let me escape [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/yzlz7s/dont_shop_at_the_isomart_after_dark/).

If I could just muster up the skill to make the best use of my luck, it would be enough to get me out for good one day.

The freight elevator finally came to a stop, and the doors creaked open to reveal the spacious and sumptuous penthouse of our employer. Portraits, animal heads, shields, weapons, and most of all masquerade masks covered nearly every square inch of the walls. Amidst the suits of armour and porcelain vases, there were dozens of priceless ornaments strewn throughout the room. They were incredibly tempting to steal, which was their whole point. Stealing from the boss was a violation of your contract, and you did not want to break your contract.  

The wide windows on the far wall offered a panoramic view of our decaying company town, nestled in a valley between sharp crimson mountains beneath a xanthous sky twinkling with a thousand black stars. You may have heard of such a place before, it has many names, but I will speak none of them here. 

Ignazio was sitting on a reclining couch in front of the fireplace, some paperwork left out on the coffee table and a featureless mask like a silver spiderweb clutched in his hand. Ignazio himself always wore the top half of a golden Oni mask, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual for our company, but the odd thing was that several portraits in the penthouse showed that it had once been a full mask.

I’ve always wondered what happened to the bottom half.  

Aside from that, Ignazio wasn’t too unusual looking. He was tall, skinny, and swarthy with a pronounced chin, tousled dark brown hair and always dressed in doublets of silk and velvet like he was performing Shakespeare or something.

Vothstag went into the room first, with Vinson almost, but not quite, at his side. Fish and Chips scamped after them, followed by Loewald, Klaus, and myself.

The last two members of our crew are called Hamm and Gristle, and they’re the two I know the least about. They keep to themselves, and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen them with their masks off. I have seen them without gloves on though, and both of their hands are white with pink-tinged fingers. I have no idea what that means, but for some reason, I always found it oddly unsettling.

The only thing I know for sure about them is that they’re the only survivors of another crew that tried to run out on their contract, and I know better than to ask for details about that.

“Gentlemen, Gentlemen, right on time,” Ignazio greeted us as he waved us over. He positioned himself on his couch to make it impossible for any of us to sit beside him, and none of us dared to take a seat at any of the clawfooted armchairs that were meant for guests with much higher stations in life. “I’ve got this moon’s scrip books all stamped and approved. You’ll notice they’re a bit light, seeing as how you were slightly behind quota on this assignment.”

None of us objected, and none of us were particularly surprised. I was grateful that the mask hid my expression, and I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. I still had to make an effort to mind my body language though. Being so accustomed to his employees and compatriots wearing masks, Ignazio was quite astute to body language.

Vinson accepted the stack of nine booklets and nodded gratefully.

“We appreciate your leniency, my lord, and look forward to earning back our privileges on our next assignment,” he said.

“I was hoping you’d say that,” Ignazio grinned as he took a sip from his crystal chalice. He set it down on the coffee table and picked up a dossier. “Halloween is fast approaching, and that means we need costumes and candy. Costumes we have in abundance, obviously, but candy’s one vice I don’t usually keep well stocked.”

“So we’re actually stealing candy from babies on our next job?” Klaus asked.

“Nothing so quotidian,” Ignazio sneered. “Remind me; have any of you met Icky before?”

The name meant nothing to me, but I glanced from side to side to see if anyone else reacted to it. I could have sworn I saw Hamm and Gristle perk their heads up slightly.

“She’s that Clown woman, right? The one in charge of that god-awful circus?” Vinson asked.

“I beg your pardon? It’s an enchanted Circus that travels the worlds and offers sanctuary to paranormal vagabonds in need,” Ignazio claimed half-heartedly. “And I might be able to pawn a few of you off on them if it comes to that, so be careful you don’t fall any further behind on your quotas. But you’re right; she is a Clown, with a capital C, and Clowns love candy. She’ll be attending my All Hallows’ Ball this year, and I don’t want her to feel excluded, so we’ll need some real top-shelf candy on offer.”

“Ah… we’re still waiting for the other shoe to drop here, boss,” Vinson confessed as most of us shared nervous glances with one another. “You want us to get candy? Fancy candy? I… I don’t get it. What’s the catch?”   

“Oh god, we’re not taking it from babies: we’re serving the babies with it!” Loewald balked in horror.

“No, but thank you for that highball to make the actual assignment seem more reasonable,” Ignazio said. “No, I’m sending you all down to the Taproots of the World Tree to collect some of the crystalized sap there.”

“The… The Taproots of the World Tree?” Vinson repeated softly. “The physical manifestation of the metaphysical network that binds all the worlds and planes of Creation, gnawed at by the Naught Things trying to break their way into reality? You’re sending us down there… for sweets?”

“Icky swears that Yggdrasil syrup pairs beautifully with French Toast,” he replied blithely. “This is an especially dangerous assignment, so I want you all to read that dossier in full. Emrys has been charting and forging new pathways through the planes from his spire in Adderwood, so thanks to him your trip down at least will be relatively easy.”

“Just… just there and back, right?” Vinson asked desperately, his voice wavering. “Just a handful of the stuff to wow Icky, and we’re done, right?”

A sadistic smirk slowly spread across Ignazio’s face before he told us how much crystalized sap we would need to retrieve.

\*\*\*

“You mine sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older, and deeper in debt,” Loebald sang as he chipped away at the pulsing amber crystal emerging from the leviathan root.

The World Tree was cosmically colossal, though it’s meaningless to describe its size since I can only describe the parts of it that exist in three dimensions. The twin trunks of the tree snaked around each other like a double helix, each alight with an ever-shifting astral aura that perpetually waxed and waned in synchronicity with its twin. From its crown sprung a seemingly infinite mass of fractally dividing branches, shimmering with countless spherical ‘leaves’ which I knew to be individual universes. The base of the tree spawned an equally infinite mass of sprawling taproots, anchoring it in place and drawing precious sustenance from the edges of reality.  

As dangerous as it was to be there, it was nonetheless a sublime experience. You think that looking upon all of existence like that would fill you with Lovecraftian madness at your own insignificance, but it was far more transcendental than that. On some fundamental level, I recognized that tree. It was Yggdrasil. It was the Biblical tree of Good and Evil. It was the Two Trees of Valinor. That tree was meant to be there, and so was everything inside of it. Sure, it was functionally infinite and everything in it was finite, but the tree wasn’t merely massive; it was intricate. In the grand scheme of things, nothing inside of it was superfluous. Everything, no matter its scale, was part of the ultimate design of the tree. You and I may not be any more important than anyone or anything else, but if we weren’t important, we wouldn’t be here.

I’m not entirely sure if any of my coworkers felt the same way though.

“Saint Peter don’t you call me, ’cause I can’t go,” Loebald continued to sing, only to be interrupted by Vothstag’s irate howling, his eyes burning like coals as he dared him to finish the chorus.

Loebald bowed his head contritely as he awkwardly cleared his throat. When Vothstag was satisfied he had been cowed into silence, he turned around to resume his work.

“’Cause I owe my soul to the company store,” I finished for him, not too loudly, but loud enough that everyone heard me.

Vothstag immediately came charging at me, roaring in fury, but I didn’t flinch. I just let him chew me out for about a minute until I heard something that I was pretty sure was a question.

“That’s ridiculous. You’re making more noise than either of us,” I countered. “And wasting more time. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got work to do.”

Vothstag sneered at me, but since I had resumed my task, his job as taskmaster was complete, and he left to attend to other matters.

“What the hell are you doing, pushing your luck like that, Brandon?” Vinson whispered.

“He was out of line. Even chain gangs are allowed to sing,” I explained. “Besides, I’m right, aren’t I? If we attract any unwanted attention, it will be because of him.”

“This isn’t the place to cause trouble!” he hissed. “Fill the carts as fast as you can so we can get out of here!”

When we arrived at the Taproots, we saw that we weren’t the first beings to try to mine this deposit of sap. Someone, likely some clan of Unseelie Fae, had established a fairly complex operation with rails and hand carts. As convenient as this was for us, it did of course pose the uncomfortable question of why the site had been completely abandoned when it was obviously far from depleted.

Me, Vinson, Loebald, and Klaus were chipping away at the crystal sap, tossing what we could into a nearby trolley cart. When it was full, Hamm and Gristle would haul it off so that Fish and Chips could scoop it into twenty-kilogram bags, which Hamm and Gristle would then stack and secure onto skids.

And as always, Vothstag supervised.

“Sixteen bleedin’ tons of this bilge,” Vinson muttered as he took a swing at it with his pickaxe. “And he’s got the nerve to tell us it’s just an appetizer for a party guest. What do you suppose they’re going to do with it all.”

“Refine it into proper syrup, I imagine,” Loewald replied. “Make it into sweets and sodas, or just drizzle some of it straight onto flapjacks. Either way, they’ll make a killing. Sixteen tons will probably sell for millions.”

“Why though? Is it just exotic sugar?” I asked.

“What do you think?” Loewald asked rhetorically, gesturing at the source. “For reality benders, anything from the edges of reality is potent stuff. They put a lump of this in their morning coffee, and the Veil will seem as weak to them as it is here. There’s no telling what havoc they’ll get up to, so you better hope we’re not around to see.”

“Now you’re just being ridiculous. Clowns don’t drink coffee,” Vinson joked.

I was about to ask him how he would know, when Vothstag put his hand on my shoulder and spun me around. Hamm and Gristle had returned with the empty cart, but only Gristle was getting ready to pull the full one. Vothstag spewed some of his usual gibberish, gesturing at me and then towards Hamm’s empty space at the cart.

“Because I sang one line? Seriously?” I asked. I was about to throw Loewald under the bus for singing in the first place, but Vothstag was already roaring incomprehensibly. “Alright, alright. I’ll pull the damn cart.”

I handed my pickaxe over to Hamm, who instantly began swinging at the sap with manic enthusiasm. Gristle gave me a slight nod of condolence before Vothstag yoked me up to the cart like an ox and then sent us on our way with an angry shout.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how come Hamm deserves a break and you don’t?” I asked Gristle as we made our way down the track, the dinging of our colleague’s pickaxes slowly fading into the background.

Gristle looked over his shoulder to confirm the Vothstag was well out of earshot, and then turned his head towards mine.

“Vinson’s wrong, you know,” he said in a soft, conspiratorial whisper.

“Ah… I’m story?” I asked.

“About Clowns and coffee,” he clarified. “Icky drinks coffee. I’ve seen her do it. She takes it with double cream and sugar to keep it Clown Kosher, of course. She’s a little too classy to indulge in stereotypical candy binges, but she’s still got a sweet tooth like the rest of us.”

“…Us?” I asked uneasily.

Gristle nodded, lifting up his gas mask by the filter and revealing his face to me for the first time. His poreless skin was a lustrous white, but his lips, nose, and the space around his eyes were all pitch black, and the eyes themselves sparkled with the light of a thousand dying stars. His mouth was spread into an unnaturally wide smile, revealing that his teeth were not only perfect but shiny to the point that I could see myself in them.

And I looked terrified.

“Loewald was right though, about what this stuff will do to us,” he went on. “Once everything’s fully loaded, Hamm and I are going to take a mouthful each and then take the whole haul for ourselves. We’ll stash some of it away somewhere safe, then use the rest to buy our way back into the Circus. The only problem is getting there. That’s where you come in.”

“What are you on about? How can I possibly help you get back to your Circus?” I asked.

“With that Seelie coin you got in your pocket,” he said, lowering his voice so that I only barely heard him. “These carts weren’t meant to be powered manually, you know. They run on Faerie magic, and that coin’s got enough that we can drive all sixteen tons of our loot to anywhere in the worlds we want.”

I briefly considered denying that I even had the coin, but if he was determined, he could find and take it easily enough, so there really wasn’t any point.

“Ignoring for the moment how you even know I have that, why not ask Vinson?” I suggested. “He’s got way more Seelie Silver than I do.”

“He doesn’t want out. You do,” Gristle responded. “You tried to escape once, and I know you’re just itching for a chance to try again.”

“But… Ignazio knows what you are, doesn’t he? He wouldn’t have let you around the sap if he wasn’t prepared for you to try to take some,” I said.

“He doesn’t know Hamm and I can take our masks off without his say-so,” Gristle explained. “We’ve been living off meagre rations of powdered milk to keep us in line, but we were able to get a hold of a bottle of the fresh stuff and chugged it before we came here. Ignazio and Vothstag have no power over us right now.”

“… I’m sorry, milk?” I asked confused.

“Not important at the moment. Are you in or not?” he asked.

I considered his proposition for a moment, deciding on one final question before answering.    

“Why not just take the coin from me?”

“Because I’m a nice guy,” he said with a sickeningly wide grin. “And… stealing Seelie Silver tends not to end well. I don’t need an answer now. The load’s not full yet. Think about it, and when the time comes, do whatever you’ve got to do.”

He pulled his mask back down, and we finished hauling the cart over to Fish and Chips in silence.

He wasn’t wrong about me wanting to escape, but my plan had always been to quietly sneak off and be long gone before anyone noticed. A fight between Vothstag and a pair of superpowered Clowns followed by a daring getaway on an Unseelie mining cart was a bit riskier than anything I had envisioned. But at the same time, this was an unprecedented opportunity that would likely never come again.  From the Taproots of the World Tree, I could go literally anywhere, and never have to worry about Ignazio or his minions tracking me down.

All it would cost me was the single coin I had to my name.

I hauled the cart with Gristle for the rest of the shift. Eventually, we had a train of sixteen pallets, each loaded with fifty twenty-kilogram sacks of crystalized sap.

“That’s it then. Order’s full,” Vinson declared as he walked the length of the train, testing the chains to make sure the cargo was fully secured. “All of you hop in the front and let’s get the hell out of here.”

Vothstag roared in disagreement, standing between us and the cart and making a vaguely groping gesture.

“Right, right. Contraband check,” Vinson nodded with a weary sigh as he outstretched his arms. “Nothing too invasive now, you hear? If this stuff was inside of us, you’d already know it.”

Vothstag didn’t acknowledge his comment, but proceeded to pat him down and empty his pockets.

Hamm and Gristle each gave me a knowing look. If I did nothing, Vothstag would find my coin and it would all be over for me anyway. I nodded my assent, and braced myself for the worse.

With a single swift motion, Hamm and Gristle each pulled their masks off, and the visages of the two monstrous Clowns were enough to throw all of us into immediate pandemonium. Hamm’s hair, eyes, lips and nose were all a fiery red, and I saw now that the tips of their ears had a pink tinge, just like their fingers. The instant their masks were off, they wasted no time shovelling a handful of crystal sap into their mouths.

Vothstag howled and charged straight at them, and everyone else scattered as quickly as they could to avoid being bulldozed by the massive deer man. Hamm and Gristle stood their ground, each of them grabbing ahold of one of his antlers. Despite his size and speed, Vothstag was brought to a dead stop.

He snorted and bellowed as he tried to force himself forward, but he was completely unable to overpower the two Clowns. Hamm and Gristle exchanged sinister smiles and began to spin Vothstag around and around. Within seconds his feet were off the ground, and with each rotation, he gained more and more momentum until his attackers finally let go of his antlers and sent him flying into the distance.

“The rest of you, stay out of our way!” Gristle shouted as he marched towards the front cart, grabbing me by the scruff of my jacket and pulling me along with him.

“Wait, why? Why can’t they come? Why can’t we all go?” I protested.

“We don’t know what half these freaks are and we don’t trust them,” he said as he tossed me onto the cart. “Now drive. Go straight until I say otherwise.”

I looked out at my confused and frightened companions, and took a bit of solace in the fact that they weren’t entirely certain if I had betrayed them or if I was just being kidnapped. I hesitated for a moment, but Hamm’s sharp talons digging into my shoulder were enough to press me into action.

With my coin of Seelie Silver clutched in my right palm, I grabbed a firm hold of the driving shaft and pushed the train forward. It accelerated at a remarkable pace, and before I knew it, we were speeding away from our work site and towards freedom.

“It’s working. It’s actually working,” Gristle laughed in relief.

“Even Vothstag can’t run this fast!” Hamm declared triumphantly. “The whole haul is ours! We’re rich! We’re free!”

I wanted to celebrate with them. I really did. But deep down inside I knew we weren’t out of the woods yet.

“You guys read that dossier Iggy gave us, right?” I asked. “The Naught Things that gnaw the Taproots are attracted to ontological anchors – anything that’s more real than its surroundings. If you guys are reality benders, and you just ate a massive power-up, doesn’t that make you the realest things here?”

“Isn’t that cute? He thinks he knows more about ontodynamics than us because he read a dossier,” Hamm scoffed.

“This isn’t our first time on the fringes of the unreal, boy!” Gristle replied. “You just drive this train, and let us worry about –”

Without warning, the Taproot split open ahead of us into a fuming, festering chasm. The ground quake was enough to completely derail the train, and I ducked and rolled while I had the chance.

When I came out of the roll, I looked up to see a titanic, disfigured, and disembodied head rising out of the chasm. The size and proportions of the entity fluctuated wildly, as if I was only looking at the three-dimensional facets of it like the World Tree itself. It was encrusted with some kind of dark barnacles, and anything that wasn’t its face was covered in thousands of squirming and feathery tentacles of every conceivable length. It had no nose, but several mouths which chanted backwards-sounding words in synchronicity with each other, dropping rotting black teeth every time they opened and closed. 

There were six randomly spaced and variously sized eyeballs darting around independently of each other, each glowing with a sickly yellow light. I was paralyzed in fear, terrified that the Naught Thing would see me, but all six of its eyes soon locked onto Hamm and Gristle.

As it slowly ascended upwards like a hot air balloon, a pair of flickering tongues shot out of two of its mouths with predatory intent. The Clowns were scooped up like flies, screaming as they were whisked back into the Naught Thing’s cavernous maws. I don’t know much about Clowns or what they’re capable of, only that Hamm and Gristle never got a chance to test their mettle against this behemoth. A few chomps of its black teeth, and it was all over.

I sat there in silence, watching as the Naught Thing continued to drift away, never daring to assume that it had forgotten about me.

“Brandon!” I heard a voice call from the distance.

I was finally able to pull my eyes off the Naught Thing, and when I looked down the track, I saw the rest of my crew hurrying towards me.

Which included a very angry Vothstag.

Grabbing me by the jacket and lifting me off the ground, he roared furiously in my face, demanding answers.

“Easy, Vothstag, easy!” Vinson insisted. “They just grabbed the kid. It wasn’t his idea.”

Vothstag growled skeptically, eyeing the toppled train beside us. He knew it could have only been driven like that by Seelie magic, and I still had my lucky coin clutched tightly in my right hand.

“…Hamm must have picked my pocket when he was working alongside us,” Vinson suggested.

I knew he didn’t really think that. He knew exactly how many coins he had, and he knew he wasn’t missing any. I don’t know why he covered for me, but I owe him big.

“Serves him right, too. Bloody idiot,” he said with a sad shake of his head as he surveyed the wreckage. “Let this be a lesson for all of you if you ever think about stealing my Seelie Silver! That’s right, Fish and Chips, I’m looking at you!”

Vothstag howled again, clearly unconvinced.

“They took me as a driver so that they could stay focused on defending the train!” I claimed. “If I hadn’t jumped when I did, they may have stood a chance against that giant floating head! I saved our haul!”

Vothstag snorted in contempt, but set me back on my feet. I don’t think he believed me, really, but he knew that Ignazio wouldn’t hold him blameless in this little debacle either, so it was in all of our best interests not to cast aspersions on one another’s stories.

“Listen up, everybody! We’re two men down and we’ve got to get this rig back on the track before some other unspeakable abomination comes along, so get moving!” Vinson ordered.

For once, Vothstag was doing most of the work, using his might to set the carts back on the tracks, while the rest of us just picked up any sacks of sap that had come loose.

“What a bloody joke,” Loewald grumbled as he threw a sack onto a cart. “Down from nine to seven, any of us could still die at any minute, and for what? We mined sixteen tons, and what do we get?”

“Another day older,” I agreed, throwing another sack next to his. “But some days, that’s enough.”

1g9k6zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/1g9k6zo/sixteen_tons/,Sixteen Tons,"“What’s got you in such a sour mood, Brandon? It’s payday!” my veteran colleague Vinson asked as the rusty freight elevator noisily rattled its way up towards the penthouse suite.

For the past year or two – I’m honestly not sure how long it’s been, actually – I’ve been under contract for an otherworldly masked Lord who calls himself Ignazio di Incognauta. He’s not a demon, exactly. He’s closer to Fae, I think, but I don’t fully understand what he is. I never sought him out. He came to me. I asked him how he even knew who I was, and he slapped me across the face for my insolence.

I still signed up though. That’s how desperate I was. He doesn’t waste his time offering deals to people who can say no.

He sends me and the rest of my crew out on what I can best describe as odd jobs. Half the time – hell, most of the time – I’m not even sure exactly what it is we’re doing. Most of the crew have been around longer than I have, and some of them aren’t human, but they all seem to have a better idea of what’s going on than me.

Our foreman Vothstag is technically the one in charge, but he’s not all there in the head; the top of his cranium’s been removed and a good chunk of his brain’s been scooped out. He mostly just barks guttural nonsense that none of us really understand, but somehow compels us to do what we’re supposed to, even when we don’t know what that is. He’s a hulking hunchback with an overgrown beard who usually wears an elk skull to cover up the hole in his head. If he was ever human, I don’t think he is now.

Vinson is our *de facto* leader, however, since he’s more or less a normal guy that we can relate to. Aside from Vothstag, he’s been working for Ignazio the longest. I won’t bother describing what he looks like, since the rest of us wear gas masks on duty. They’re partially to protect us from environmental and workplace hazards, partially to conceal our identities, but mainly to bring us more easily under Ignazio’s control.

That was why were all wearing our masks on the elevator, incidentally. We were on our way to see the big boss, and our contracts made it very clear we were never to remove our masks in his presence.  

“Come on, Vinson. You know meetings with Iggy never go well,” I replied bluntly.

“Oh, it’s just bluster. You know that. He’s got to put the fear of God into us,” Vinson claimed. “If he wasn’t actually satisfied with our performance, we wouldn’t still be here.”

“No, Brandon’s right. Iggy wouldn’t have called all ten of us in just to hand us our scrip and call us lazy arses,” Loewald chimed in.

“There’s nine of us, now,” Klaus reminded him grimly.

“Right, sorry. Hard to keep track some days,” Loewald admitted. “Regardless; something’s up, and the odds are pretty slim it will be something we like.”

I cringed as Vothstag shouted some of his garbled nonsense back towards Loewald.

“Yes, I know we’re not being paid to have fun, but –”

“We’re not being paid at all!” Klaus interrupted. “None of us are getting any real money until our contracts are up, and have any of you actually known anyone who made it to the end of their contract?” 

He recoiled as Vothstag spun around and began roaring at him, hot spittle flying out from beneath his mask of carved bone as he furiously waved his fist in his face.

“He’s right, Klaus. You’re being paranoid,” Vinson said in an eerily calm tone. “I’ve served out multiple contracts, and I’ve got the silver to prove it.”

He confidently reached into his pocket and held a troy-ounce coin of Seelie Silver between his fingers. Fish and Chips, the pair of three-foot-tall… *somethings* that work for us immediately crowded around him and began eyeing it greedily.

“That’s right boys, take a gander. That’s powerful magic right there, and you’ll get one of these for every moon you’ve worked at the end of your contracts,” he reminded us before quickly pocketing the coin away again. “Unless, of course, you do something to get your contract prematurely terminated; then you’ll have nothing to show for it but a fistful of expired scrip! So keep your heads down, mouths shut, and your eyes on the prize. You’ll have pockets jangling full of coins soon enough.”

As discreetly as I could, I slipped my hands into my pockets and rubbed my one Seelie coin for good luck. None of them knew I had it, because I didn’t want to explain how I got it, but that little bit of fortune it brought me had almost been enough to let me escape [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/yzlz7s/dont_shop_at_the_isomart_after_dark/).

If I could just muster up the skill to make the best use of my luck, it would be enough to get me out for good one day.

The freight elevator finally came to a stop, and the doors creaked open to reveal the spacious and sumptuous penthouse of our employer. Portraits, animal heads, shields, weapons, and most of all masquerade masks covered nearly every square inch of the walls. Amidst the suits of armour and porcelain vases, there were dozens of priceless ornaments strewn throughout the room. They were incredibly tempting to steal, which was their whole point. Stealing from the boss was a violation of your contract, and you did not want to break your contract.  

The wide windows on the far wall offered a panoramic view of our decaying company town, nestled in a valley between sharp crimson mountains beneath a xanthous sky twinkling with a thousand black stars. You may have heard of such a place before, it has many names, but I will speak none of them here. 

Ignazio was sitting on a reclining couch in front of the fireplace, some paperwork left out on the coffee table and a featureless mask like a silver spiderweb clutched in his hand. Ignazio himself always wore the top half of a golden Oni mask, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual for our company, but the odd thing was that several portraits in the penthouse showed that it had once been a full mask.

I’ve always wondered what happened to the bottom half.  

Aside from that, Ignazio wasn’t too unusual looking. He was tall, skinny, and swarthy with a pronounced chin, tousled dark brown hair and always dressed in doublets of silk and velvet like he was performing Shakespeare or something.

Vothstag went into the room first, with Vinson almost, but not quite, at his side. Fish and Chips scamped after them, followed by Loewald, Klaus, and myself.

The last two members of our crew are called Hamm and Gristle, and they’re the two I know the least about. They keep to themselves, and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen them with their masks off. I have seen them without gloves on though, and both of their hands are white with pink-tinged fingers. I have no idea what that means, but for some reason, I always found it oddly unsettling.

The only thing I know for sure about them is that they’re the only survivors of another crew that tried to run out on their contract, and I know better than to ask for details about that.

“Gentlemen, Gentlemen, right on time,” Ignazio greeted us as he waved us over. He positioned himself on his couch to make it impossible for any of us to sit beside him, and none of us dared to take a seat at any of the clawfooted armchairs that were meant for guests with much higher stations in life. “I’ve got this moon’s scrip books all stamped and approved. You’ll notice they’re a bit light, seeing as how you were slightly behind quota on this assignment.”

None of us objected, and none of us were particularly surprised. I was grateful that the mask hid my expression, and I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. I still had to make an effort to mind my body language though. Being so accustomed to his employees and compatriots wearing masks, Ignazio was quite astute to body language.

Vinson accepted the stack of nine booklets and nodded gratefully.

“We appreciate your leniency, my lord, and look forward to earning back our privileges on our next assignment,” he said.

“I was hoping you’d say that,” Ignazio grinned as he took a sip from his crystal chalice. He set it down on the coffee table and picked up a dossier. “Halloween is fast approaching, and that means we need costumes and candy. Costumes we have in abundance, obviously, but candy’s one vice I don’t usually keep well stocked.”

“So we’re actually stealing candy from babies on our next job?” Klaus asked.

“Nothing so quotidian,” Ignazio sneered. “Remind me; have any of you met Icky before?”

The name meant nothing to me, but I glanced from side to side to see if anyone else reacted to it. I could have sworn I saw Hamm and Gristle perk their heads up slightly.

“She’s that Clown woman, right? The one in charge of that god-awful circus?” Vinson asked.

“I beg your pardon? It’s an enchanted Circus that travels the worlds and offers sanctuary to paranormal vagabonds in need,” Ignazio claimed half-heartedly. “And I might be able to pawn a few of you off on them if it comes to that, so be careful you don’t fall any further behind on your quotas. But you’re right; she is a Clown, with a capital C, and Clowns love candy. She’ll be attending my All Hallows’ Ball this year, and I don’t want her to feel excluded, so we’ll need some real top-shelf candy on offer.”

“Ah… we’re still waiting for the other shoe to drop here, boss,” Vinson confessed as most of us shared nervous glances with one another. “You want us to get candy? Fancy candy? I… I don’t get it. What’s the catch?”   

“Oh god, we’re not taking it from babies: we’re serving the babies with it!” Loewald balked in horror.

“No, but thank you for that highball to make the actual assignment seem more reasonable,” Ignazio said. “No, I’m sending you all down to the Taproots of the World Tree to collect some of the crystalized sap there.”

“The… The Taproots of the World Tree?” Vinson repeated softly. “The physical manifestation of the metaphysical network that binds all the worlds and planes of Creation, gnawed at by the Naught Things trying to break their way into reality? You’re sending us down there… for sweets?”

“Icky swears that Yggdrasil syrup pairs beautifully with French Toast,” he replied blithely. “This is an especially dangerous assignment, so I want you all to read that dossier in full. Emrys has been charting and forging new pathways through the planes from his spire in Adderwood, so thanks to him your trip down at least will be relatively easy.”

“Just… just there and back, right?” Vinson asked desperately, his voice wavering. “Just a handful of the stuff to wow Icky, and we’re done, right?”

A sadistic smirk slowly spread across Ignazio’s face before he told us how much crystalized sap we would need to retrieve.

\*\*\*

“You mine sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older, and deeper in debt,” Loebald sang as he chipped away at the pulsing amber crystal emerging from the leviathan root.

The World Tree was cosmically colossal, though it’s meaningless to describe its size since I can only describe the parts of it that exist in three dimensions. The twin trunks of the tree snaked around each other like a double helix, each alight with an ever-shifting astral aura that perpetually waxed and waned in synchronicity with its twin. From its crown sprung a seemingly infinite mass of fractally dividing branches, shimmering with countless spherical ‘leaves’ which I knew to be individual universes. The base of the tree spawned an equally infinite mass of sprawling taproots, anchoring it in place and drawing precious sustenance from the edges of reality.  

As dangerous as it was to be there, it was nonetheless a sublime experience. You think that looking upon all of existence like that would fill you with Lovecraftian madness at your own insignificance, but it was far more transcendental than that. On some fundamental level, I recognized that tree. It was Yggdrasil. It was the Biblical tree of Good and Evil. It was the Two Trees of Valinor. That tree was meant to be there, and so was everything inside of it. Sure, it was functionally infinite and everything in it was finite, but the tree wasn’t merely massive; it was intricate. In the grand scheme of things, nothing inside of it was superfluous. Everything, no matter its scale, was part of the ultimate design of the tree. You and I may not be any more important than anyone or anything else, but if we weren’t important, we wouldn’t be here.

I’m not entirely sure if any of my coworkers felt the same way though.

“Saint Peter don’t you call me, ’cause I can’t go,” Loebald continued to sing, only to be interrupted by Vothstag’s irate howling, his eyes burning like coals as he dared him to finish the chorus.

Loebald bowed his head contritely as he awkwardly cleared his throat. When Vothstag was satisfied he had been cowed into silence, he turned around to resume his work.

“’Cause I owe my soul to the company store,” I finished for him, not too loudly, but loud enough that everyone heard me.

Vothstag immediately came charging at me, roaring in fury, but I didn’t flinch. I just let him chew me out for about a minute until I heard something that I was pretty sure was a question.

“That’s ridiculous. You’re making more noise than either of us,” I countered. “And wasting more time. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got work to do.”

Vothstag sneered at me, but since I had resumed my task, his job as taskmaster was complete, and he left to attend to other matters.

“What the hell are you doing, pushing your luck like that, Brandon?” Vinson whispered.

“He was out of line. Even chain gangs are allowed to sing,” I explained. “Besides, I’m right, aren’t I? If we attract any unwanted attention, it will be because of him.”

“This isn’t the place to cause trouble!” he hissed. “Fill the carts as fast as you can so we can get out of here!”

When we arrived at the Taproots, we saw that we weren’t the first beings to try to mine this deposit of sap. Someone, likely some clan of Unseelie Fae, had established a fairly complex operation with rails and hand carts. As convenient as this was for us, it did of course pose the uncomfortable question of why the site had been completely abandoned when it was obviously far from depleted.

Me, Vinson, Loebald, and Klaus were chipping away at the crystal sap, tossing what we could into a nearby trolley cart. When it was full, Hamm and Gristle would haul it off so that Fish and Chips could scoop it into twenty-kilogram bags, which Hamm and Gristle would then stack and secure onto skids.

And as always, Vothstag supervised.

“Sixteen bleedin’ tons of this bilge,” Vinson muttered as he took a swing at it with his pickaxe. “And he’s got the nerve to tell us it’s just an appetizer for a party guest. What do you suppose they’re going to do with it all.”

“Refine it into proper syrup, I imagine,” Loewald replied. “Make it into sweets and sodas, or just drizzle some of it straight onto flapjacks. Either way, they’ll make a killing. Sixteen tons will probably sell for millions.”

“Why though? Is it just exotic sugar?” I asked.

“What do you think?” Loewald asked rhetorically, gesturing at the source. “For reality benders, anything from the edges of reality is potent stuff. They put a lump of this in their morning coffee, and the Veil will seem as weak to them as it is here. There’s no telling what havoc they’ll get up to, so you better hope we’re not around to see.”

“Now you’re just being ridiculous. Clowns don’t drink coffee,” Vinson joked.

I was about to ask him how he would know, when Vothstag put his hand on my shoulder and spun me around. Hamm and Gristle had returned with the empty cart, but only Gristle was getting ready to pull the full one. Vothstag spewed some of his usual gibberish, gesturing at me and then towards Hamm’s empty space at the cart.

“Because I sang one line? Seriously?” I asked. I was about to throw Loewald under the bus for singing in the first place, but Vothstag was already roaring incomprehensibly. “Alright, alright. I’ll pull the damn cart.”

I handed my pickaxe over to Hamm, who instantly began swinging at the sap with manic enthusiasm. Gristle gave me a slight nod of condolence before Vothstag yoked me up to the cart like an ox and then sent us on our way with an angry shout.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how come Hamm deserves a break and you don’t?” I asked Gristle as we made our way down the track, the dinging of our colleague’s pickaxes slowly fading into the background.

Gristle looked over his shoulder to confirm the Vothstag was well out of earshot, and then turned his head towards mine.

“Vinson’s wrong, you know,” he said in a soft, conspiratorial whisper.

“Ah… I’m story?” I asked.

“About Clowns and coffee,” he clarified. “Icky drinks coffee. I’ve seen her do it. She takes it with double cream and sugar to keep it Clown Kosher, of course. She’s a little too classy to indulge in stereotypical candy binges, but she’s still got a sweet tooth like the rest of us.”

“…Us?” I asked uneasily.

Gristle nodded, lifting up his gas mask by the filter and revealing his face to me for the first time. His poreless skin was a lustrous white, but his lips, nose, and the space around his eyes were all pitch black, and the eyes themselves sparkled with the light of a thousand dying stars. His mouth was spread into an unnaturally wide smile, revealing that his teeth were not only perfect but shiny to the point that I could see myself in them.

And I looked terrified.

“Loewald was right though, about what this stuff will do to us,” he went on. “Once everything’s fully loaded, Hamm and I are going to take a mouthful each and then take the whole haul for ourselves. We’ll stash some of it away somewhere safe, then use the rest to buy our way back into the Circus. The only problem is getting there. That’s where you come in.”

“What are you on about? How can I possibly help you get back to your Circus?” I asked.

“With that Seelie coin you got in your pocket,” he said, lowering his voice so that I only barely heard him. “These carts weren’t meant to be powered manually, you know. They run on Faerie magic, and that coin’s got enough that we can drive all sixteen tons of our loot to anywhere in the worlds we want.”

I briefly considered denying that I even had the coin, but if he was determined, he could find and take it easily enough, so there really wasn’t any point.

“Ignoring for the moment how you even know I have that, why not ask Vinson?” I suggested. “He’s got way more Seelie Silver than I do.”

“He doesn’t want out. You do,” Gristle responded. “You tried to escape once, and I know you’re just itching for a chance to try again.”

“But… Ignazio knows what you are, doesn’t he? He wouldn’t have let you around the sap if he wasn’t prepared for you to try to take some,” I said.

“He doesn’t know Hamm and I can take our masks off without his say-so,” Gristle explained. “We’ve been living off meagre rations of powdered milk to keep us in line, but we were able to get a hold of a bottle of the fresh stuff and chugged it before we came here. Ignazio and Vothstag have no power over us right now.”

“… I’m sorry, milk?” I asked confused.

“Not important at the moment. Are you in or not?” he asked.

I considered his proposition for a moment, deciding on one final question before answering.    

“Why not just take the coin from me?”

“Because I’m a nice guy,” he said with a sickeningly wide grin. “And… stealing Seelie Silver tends not to end well. I don’t need an answer now. The load’s not full yet. Think about it, and when the time comes, do whatever you’ve got to do.”

He pulled his mask back down, and we finished hauling the cart over to Fish and Chips in silence.

He wasn’t wrong about me wanting to escape, but my plan had always been to quietly sneak off and be long gone before anyone noticed. A fight between Vothstag and a pair of superpowered Clowns followed by a daring getaway on an Unseelie mining cart was a bit riskier than anything I had envisioned. But at the same time, this was an unprecedented opportunity that would likely never come again.  From the Taproots of the World Tree, I could go literally anywhere, and never have to worry about Ignazio or his minions tracking me down.

All it would cost me was the single coin I had to my name.

I hauled the cart with Gristle for the rest of the shift. Eventually, we had a train of sixteen pallets, each loaded with fifty twenty-kilogram sacks of crystalized sap.

“That’s it then. Order’s full,” Vinson declared as he walked the length of the train, testing the chains to make sure the cargo was fully secured. “All of you hop in the front and let’s get the hell out of here.”

Vothstag roared in disagreement, standing between us and the cart and making a vaguely groping gesture.

“Right, right. Contraband check,” Vinson nodded with a weary sigh as he outstretched his arms. “Nothing too invasive now, you hear? If this stuff was inside of us, you’d already know it.”

Vothstag didn’t acknowledge his comment, but proceeded to pat him down and empty his pockets.

Hamm and Gristle each gave me a knowing look. If I did nothing, Vothstag would find my coin and it would all be over for me anyway. I nodded my assent, and braced myself for the worse.

With a single swift motion, Hamm and Gristle each pulled their masks off, and the visages of the two monstrous Clowns were enough to throw all of us into immediate pandemonium. Hamm’s hair, eyes, lips and nose were all a fiery red, and I saw now that the tips of their ears had a pink tinge, just like their fingers. The instant their masks were off, they wasted no time shovelling a handful of crystal sap into their mouths.

Vothstag howled and charged straight at them, and everyone else scattered as quickly as they could to avoid being bulldozed by the massive deer man. Hamm and Gristle stood their ground, each of them grabbing ahold of one of his antlers. Despite his size and speed, Vothstag was brought to a dead stop.

He snorted and bellowed as he tried to force himself forward, but he was completely unable to overpower the two Clowns. Hamm and Gristle exchanged sinister smiles and began to spin Vothstag around and around. Within seconds his feet were off the ground, and with each rotation, he gained more and more momentum until his attackers finally let go of his antlers and sent him flying into the distance.

“The rest of you, stay out of our way!” Gristle shouted as he marched towards the front cart, grabbing me by the scruff of my jacket and pulling me along with him.

“Wait, why? Why can’t they come? Why can’t we all go?” I protested.

“We don’t know what half these freaks are and we don’t trust them,” he said as he tossed me onto the cart. “Now drive. Go straight until I say otherwise.”

I looked out at my confused and frightened companions, and took a bit of solace in the fact that they weren’t entirely certain if I had betrayed them or if I was just being kidnapped. I hesitated for a moment, but Hamm’s sharp talons digging into my shoulder were enough to press me into action.

With my coin of Seelie Silver clutched in my right palm, I grabbed a firm hold of the driving shaft and pushed the train forward. It accelerated at a remarkable pace, and before I knew it, we were speeding away from our work site and towards freedom.

“It’s working. It’s actually working,” Gristle laughed in relief.

“Even Vothstag can’t run this fast!” Hamm declared triumphantly. “The whole haul is ours! We’re rich! We’re free!”

I wanted to celebrate with them. I really did. But deep down inside I knew we weren’t out of the woods yet.

“You guys read that dossier Iggy gave us, right?” I asked. “The Naught Things that gnaw the Taproots are attracted to ontological anchors – anything that’s more real than its surroundings. If you guys are reality benders, and you just ate a massive power-up, doesn’t that make you the realest things here?”

“Isn’t that cute? He thinks he knows more about ontodynamics than us because he read a dossier,” Hamm scoffed.

“This isn’t our first time on the fringes of the unreal, boy!” Gristle replied. “You just drive this train, and let us worry about –”

Without warning, the Taproot split open ahead of us into a fuming, festering chasm. The ground quake was enough to completely derail the train, and I ducked and rolled while I had the chance.

When I came out of the roll, I looked up to see a titanic, disfigured, and disembodied head rising out of the chasm. The size and proportions of the entity fluctuated wildly, as if I was only looking at the three-dimensional facets of it like the World Tree itself. It was encrusted with some kind of dark barnacles, and anything that wasn’t its face was covered in thousands of squirming and feathery tentacles of every conceivable length. It had no nose, but several mouths which chanted backwards-sounding words in synchronicity with each other, dropping rotting black teeth every time they opened and closed. 

There were six randomly spaced and variously sized eyeballs darting around independently of each other, each glowing with a sickly yellow light. I was paralyzed in fear, terrified that the Naught Thing would see me, but all six of its eyes soon locked onto Hamm and Gristle.

As it slowly ascended upwards like a hot air balloon, a pair of flickering tongues shot out of two of its mouths with predatory intent. The Clowns were scooped up like flies, screaming as they were whisked back into the Naught Thing’s cavernous maws. I don’t know much about Clowns or what they’re capable of, only that Hamm and Gristle never got a chance to test their mettle against this behemoth. A few chomps of its black teeth, and it was all over.

I sat there in silence, watching as the Naught Thing continued to drift away, never daring to assume that it had forgotten about me.

“Brandon!” I heard a voice call from the distance.

I was finally able to pull my eyes off the Naught Thing, and when I looked down the track, I saw the rest of my crew hurrying towards me.

Which included a very angry Vothstag.

Grabbing me by the jacket and lifting me off the ground, he roared furiously in my face, demanding answers.

“Easy, Vothstag, easy!” Vinson insisted. “They just grabbed the kid. It wasn’t his idea.”

Vothstag growled skeptically, eyeing the toppled train beside us. He knew it could have only been driven like that by Seelie magic, and I still had my lucky coin clutched tightly in my right hand.

“…Hamm must have picked my pocket when he was working alongside us,” Vinson suggested.

I knew he didn’t really think that. He knew exactly how many coins he had, and he knew he wasn’t missing any. I don’t know why he covered for me, but I owe him big.

“Serves him right, too. Bloody idiot,” he said with a sad shake of his head as he surveyed the wreckage. “Let this be a lesson for all of you if you ever think about stealing my Seelie Silver! That’s right, Fish and Chips, I’m looking at you!”

Vothstag howled again, clearly unconvinced.

“They took me as a driver so that they could stay focused on defending the train!” I claimed. “If I hadn’t jumped when I did, they may have stood a chance against that giant floating head! I saved our haul!”

Vothstag snorted in contempt, but set me back on my feet. I don’t think he believed me, really, but he knew that Ignazio wouldn’t hold him blameless in this little debacle either, so it was in all of our best interests not to cast aspersions on one another’s stories.

“Listen up, everybody! We’re two men down and we’ve got to get this rig back on the track before some other unspeakable abomination comes along, so get moving!” Vinson ordered.

For once, Vothstag was doing most of the work, using his might to set the carts back on the tracks, while the rest of us just picked up any sacks of sap that had come loose.

“What a bloody joke,” Loewald grumbled as he threw a sack onto a cart. “Down from nine to seven, any of us could still die at any minute, and for what? We mined sixteen tons, and what do we get?”

“Another day older,” I agreed, throwing another sack next to his. “But some days, that’s enough.”

1g9k568,https://i.redd.it/t5vqwtnmnbwd1.jpeg,Review for 5 perfume decants and partial bottle purchased from u/Southern_Ad_8356,"Hello! Fellow Perfume Lovers,

Just wanted to say a big thanks to the lovely seller u/Southern_Ad_8356 for the wonderful purchase experience. Detailed seller review posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianBeautyDeclutter/s/FCzmfqtWup). Vouch for her a 1000%. A lovely and delightful person to deal with. 

Quickly jumping into 
About Perfumes:

1) Calvin Klein Eternity Intense: An interesting flanker to the Eternity line, in that it bares very little resemblance to the OG. This opens mildly watery sweet tart (almost like an overripe plum or cherry) and quickly progresses to lovely florals. The powdery essence appears at the start of the middle stage (say 20-minute mark) where it acquires a slight makeup-y vibe (love that) and dries down to reveal creamy musk and sandalwood. The waxiness and lipstick scent stays consistently throughout. It's a deep and mysterious composition so might be better suited for an evening rendezvous and in cooler months. Great lasting power (5+ hours), mesmerizing sillage trail and good projection. And this is from just three sprays. I reckon it would be good to layer with sweet floral scents. Not a safe blind buy for sure for those who don't like powdery perfumes. A strong love for me and 👍👍👍

2) Chanel Coco Mademoiselle: Nothing new to report on this classic gem that hasn't been mentioned a thousand times already. Finished a bottle long back. Tried a few clones (Armaf Club de Nuit Woman is a good one. Thanks, Decantosaurus, for the recommendation). Wanted a decant for keepsake. Score. Eternal love and 👍👍👍👍

3) Paris Corner Eternal Coffee: Warm caramel latte mochaccino with a dash of Bailey's for some friskiness. Paris Corner does the best wholly western-leaning perfume renditions IMO. Pity it has average to low lasting power and requires regular refreshing (you'll likely end up emptying a bottle sooner than expected). That despite this perfume is a rich, creamy Gourmand that will be perfect for winter afternoons - I would go bonkers if I smelled this on someone at a bookstore! Strong like and 👍👍

4) Paris Corner Qissa Pink: I'll be honest. The only reason I bought this perfume was because it was a bundled offer with Eternal Coffee. I'm a womanly woman and not a girlie girl, so perfumes that seem ""pink-ish"" don't quite catch my attention. Still, I'm glad I got to try this. Qissa Pink smells like strawberry flavoured marshmallows with coconut shavings served on a plate laced with baby powder (I'm not even making any sense to myself anymore!). Qissa Pink isn't a straight up fruity gourmand - I'd call this more fruity clean. I would imagine this smells along the same lines as Yara (pink) and the like. A crowd pleaser probably because it's uncomplicated and mild. I sprayed just one spritz and had it on for maybe 30 minutes, then washed it off. So no clue about longevity, sillage, projection and all that jazz. Not a personal preference so just meh and 🤷

5) Marks & Spencer Pink Pepper: Said to dupe Lancome La Vie est Belle. It's almost there. Some say it also mirrors Glossier You. I like this one! Cheap and cheerful alternate to LVEB. Below average lasting power as is the case with most M&S perfumes. But it's the perfect match to layer over LVEB if you don't want to run low on the expensive inspiration. Just keep topping it up every once in a while and you'll be smelling fresh. Sweet floral vanillic mildly woody concoction that's perfect for day wear in any weather. Like and 👍

Thanks for reading! Cheers, and keep smelling amazing!

Tried a few clones (Armaf Club de Nuit Woman is a good one. Thanks, Decantosaurus, for the recommendation). Wanted a decant for keepsake. Score. Eternal love and 👍👍👍👍

3) Paris Corner Eternal Coffee: Warm caramel latte mochaccino with a dash of Bailey's for some friskiness. Paris Corner does the best wholly western-leaning perfume renditions IMO. Pity it has average to low lasting power and requires regular refreshing (you'll likely end up emptying a bottle sooner than expected). That despite this perfume is a rich, creamy Gourmand that will be perfect for winter afternoons - I would go bonkers if I smelled this on someone at a bookstore! Strong like and 👍👍

4) Paris Corner Qissa Pink: I'll be honest. The only reason I bought this perfume was because it was a bundled offer with Eternal Coffee. I'm a womanly woman and not a girlie girl, so perfumes that seem ""pink-ish"" don't quite catch my attention. Still, I'm glad I got to try this. Qissa Pink smells like strawberry flavoured marshmallows with coconut shavings served on a plate laced with baby powder (I'm not even making any sense to myself anymore!). Qissa Pink isn't a straight up fruity gourmand - I'd call this more fruity clean. I would imagine this smells along the same lines as Yara (pink) and the like. A crowd pleaser probably because it's uncomplicated and mild. I sprayed just one spritz and had it on for maybe 30 minutes, then washed it off. So no clue about longevity, sillage, projection and all that jazz. Not a personal preference so just meh and 🤷

5) Marks & Spencer Pink Pepper: Said to dupe Lancome La Vie est Belle. It's almost there. Some say it also mirrors Glossier You. I like this one! Cheap and cheerful alternate to LVEB. Below average lasting power as is the case with most M&S perfumes. But it's the perfect match to layer over LVEB if you don't want to run low on the expensive inspiration. Just keep topping it up every once in a while and you'll be smelling fresh. Sweet floral vanillic ambery concoction that's perfect for day wear in any weather. Like and 👍

Thanks for reading! Cheers, and keep smelling amazing!

1g9k2wm,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1g9k2wm/6_months_update/,6 months update,"I don’t know where to start, but these past six months have been a roller-coaster. This stupid pill turned my life upside down. Sometimes I wake up in the morning, look at myself in the mirror, and don’t even recognize the person looking back.

**Timeline:**

I took 5 pills of Moxi starting April 19th daily for mycoplasma genitalium after a failed treatment with Doxy + Azithromycin. By day 3 or 4, I felt dizzy, and some tingling and mild neuropathy in my legs started. I discontinued on day 5. Then I started Googling and saw information about FQAD, which triggered a huge panic attack.

I’ve had a lot of CNS issues since then: dizziness (feeling like I’m drunk and the world is spinning), sensitivity to light and sound (often triggering dizziness), waking up in the middle of the night and being unable to fall back asleep, and sweating...

My musculoskeletal system has also been affected. Before floxing, I could do a 90kg squat and a 60kg bench press. Afterward, I struggled to walk 2,000 steps or climb stairs. Thank God I wasn’t bed-bound, but in the beginning, I lived in constant fear.

Additionally, I got floaters after trying Nicotinamide Riboside around week 7 or 8. I really don’t recommend this supplement for acute-stage floxies! Everything went downhill from there, but I bounced back after 4-5 weeks.

To top it all off, Moxi wrecked my digestive system. I had diarrhea/constipation, which led to an anal abscess around week 12. It got worse in September, so I had drainage surgery and was put on Augmentin for a week. Lucky me, 10 days after Augmentin, I got strep throat and was prescribed a mega dose of penicillin (4.5g/day) for 10 days! These two follow-up antibiotic treatments flared up my symptoms a bit—CNS issues worsened, I was more tired, and I couldn’t walk as much as I used to. The flare-up might’ve been due to the bacterial infection.

**Progress:**

I wouldn’t say I’m back to normal (don’t want to jinx it), but I’ve seen significant improvements. I might or might not flare up again in the future, but that’s for tomorrow’s me to worry about. Today, I want to enjoy the present without worrying about what’s next.

Last Sunday, I managed to walk 10K+ steps without any soreness or pain in my legs. Except for occasional dizziness and persistent floaters, I’m doing much better than I was in May. I plan to go back to the gym next week with gentle exercise if my progress continues this week.

**What I’ve Learned:**

I treat myself better now. I quit alcohol, stopped staying up late, and started eating organic, balanced, high-quality food. I’m more patient with myself and no longer force myself to do things like I used to. I prioritize my health and well-being over money or work. I’ve also become more empathetic toward people in need and realized how lucky I am.

**What Helped:**

Most supplements feel like placebos. Give yourself time, be patient, and believe in yourself. You will get better—you can heal yourself eventually. Relax, let your vagus nerve heal, and let your body do its work.

I’ve recently tried Magnesium L-threonate, which has really helped with sleep and brain fog.

I’m currently taking:

* Magnesium bisglycinate 2x per day + Magnesium L-threonate before bed
* Vitamin D (2000 IU)
* Vegan Omega-3 (1.5g/day)
* Hydrolyzed collagen (15g)
* Manganese bisglycinate (after a hair analysis showed manganese deficiency)

**Food:**

I eat a lot of kimchi, rose hip kombucha, pomegranate, and freeze-dried wild blueberries. I tried an 8/16 fasting schedule, along with a gluten-free, low-carb diet, but didn’t notice much difference besides losing 5 kilos (67 kg before flox, Male, 175 cm). Now I’m eating everything and slowly gaining the weight back!

Tea and coffee (even diet coke) trigger my CNS like crazy, so I’m avoiding them completely. I can drink beer without an issue, but I don’t plan to get drunk ever again.

**Doctors/Therapies:**

Dr. Pieper diagnosed me with Gilbert’s syndrome; he said Bilirubin is a strong antioxidant and it prevented FQ damage to my neuro symptoms and mito. I’m currently doing acupuncture, physiotherapy (TENS and massage), stretching, and psychotherapy (it really helped in the beginning when I was stressed and suffering from flox hell)

**Lifestyle:**

Being in nature, sunbathing, sauna, SPA treatment (German/Czech/Austrian spa towns), magnesium salt bath. most importantly: staying active (within my tolerance)

**Endnote:**  
I hope that one day, no one will ever have to suffer from this poison. Sooner or later, there will be accessible treatment for all of us.

I reported my side effects to my local European Medicines Agency. The agent followed up with me and took a detailed report. She informed me that these side effects I'm experiencing are well-known in my region and the use of any FQ is limited in practice. (I got Moxi while on holiday in Thailand prescribed by a GP from the over-the-counter section in the pharmacy. I still cannot believe this poison is sold as OTC in some parts of the world.)",6,1729608866.0,floxies,2,1.0,False

Zeno: (in Ionic) We also learned to speak English but you call that English. (starts speaking English in an American accent) This, this is English!

Pericles: Well, we’ve been learning English by having spent centuries listening to BBC radio broadcasts. 

Zeno: Well we spend centuries absorbing American TV shows. You talk weird. 

Pericles: Well, clearly, old chap, our way of speaking is far more refined. The elegance of the Queen’s English is unmatched, I must say. I mean English is surprise, surprise, from England so it makes sense to speak with an accent from over there. We sound positively scholarly.

Zeno: Scholarly? You mean boring, right? No offense, man, but you sound like you're narrating a nature documentary about rocks. I’d rather sound like I’m starring in a hit sitcom!

Sappho:(in a posh British accent) Ah yes, an American sitcom where the joke is screaming and pointing stuff out. Oh, please. American accents sound like someone’s been gargling gravel. You’ve no cadence, no poshness. It’s all… what’s the phrase… like nails on a chalkboard, darling.

Demetrius: (in an American accent) (pushing back his toga) Yeah? Well, at least when we talk, people don’t think we’re about to give a lecture on ancient pottery. You sound like you would give a joke but we have no idea what it is! We sound cool — like, I don’t know, we could be in a Hollywood movie or something.

Sophocles: (in a posh British accent) Hollywood? How utterly pedestrian. We don’t lower ourselves to slop blockbusters, do we? No, we sound like we could guide you through the annals of history with grace and dignity.

Thales: (in an American accent)  Dude, please. Your ""dignity"" is snooze-worthy. I’ve watched a hundred American movies where someone with a British accent was the villain. You sound like you’re about to invade a planet or throw someone off a skyscraper. Just sayin’.

Pericles: Villains are often the most cultured characters, might I remind you. It takes a certain gravitas, which your flat tones simply lack. I mean, you could barely deliver a soliloquy!

Zeno: Soliloquy? We don’t need soliloquies. We’ve got catchphrases. ""Yippee-ki-yay!"" Bet your fancy accents can’t pull that off.

Sappho: Oh, how charming… a catchphrase. How very low-brow. British monologues are the stuff of legend! Can you imagine Hamlet's ""To be or not to be"" in that ghastly accent of yours? The horror!

Demetrius: (mocking her tone) Oh, the horror indeed. Hey! People would rather hear, “I’ll be back,” than a ten-minute speech about existential dread! We get to the point.

Sophocles: Yes, Americans do love to rush things, don’t they? Even their accents sprint through words as if there’s some sort of deadline. No time for reflection, just: ""Let’s move it along!""

Thales: And those Brits are over there sounding like they're always bored. Maybe when ordering coffee don't always sound like you're dead inside!

Pericles: Perhaps if you appreciated subtlety and nuance, you’d—

Zeno: (cutting him off) Appreciate? Dude, I appreciate a good pizza and an action scene! Subtlety is overrated. That’s why all the big movies have explosions. Explosions sound better in American, trust me.

Sappho: (sighs dramatically) Your ears must be atrophied from hearing all that... noise. True eloquence... true art comes in whispers, dear.

Demetrius: (rolling eyes) Okay, Whisper Lady, enjoy your tea and crumpets while America takes over the box office!

Sophocles:  Britain takes over the cultural high ground. Maybe when doing a period piece set in Rome or Greece, people shouldn’t sound like they weigh 600 pounds and have high medical bills!

Zeno: Maybe people in period pieces shouldn’t always sound like they might be partying at 10 Downing Street!

Sappho: Maybe people in period pieces shouldn’t sound like they have to hide in case someone comes in with an AR15!

Thales: Maybe people in period pieces shouldn’t sound like they don’t brush their teeth!

Sappho: Can you imagine “I, Claudius” made with American accents? It would just not sound as good. Maybe someone should make a biopic on Abraham Lincoln with everyone in British accents? 

Thales: Fine, make that, I don't mind. Yeah, good luck with that. We’ll be over here sounding like we have great theme parks and streaming services!

Pericles:Perhaps we’ll compromise one day, but until then, at least we don’t have to endure the sound of... (imitating American accent poorly) ""Howdy, partner!""

Zeno: And you won’t catch us saying, ""Pip pip, cheerio!"" either!

Sappho: Who actually says “Pip, pip, cheerio”. Listened to hundreds of radio shows and not once did anybody say that!

I made it clear from day one that I practice parallel polyamory, and said no.

Throughout my relationship with Oak, I’ve been proactive in initiating RADAR, smorgasbord, sharing calendars, regular testing, and working on my own emotional support through therapy and friends. I want to build a strong foundation for this relationship and be a supportive partner/hinge, especially as we both see this as long-term. However, I’m starting to feel burned out, as it seems Oak is still new to this kind of relationship maintenance and needs some guidance.

Yet, the feeling of emotional labour still lingers.

1g9jnul,https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1g9jnul/race_report_detroit_marathon_second_attempt_at/,Race Report: Detroit Marathon. Second attempt at the 26.2 mile distance and a PR improvement by 23 minutes.,"**Event**: [Detroit Free Press Marathon](https://www.freepmarathon.com/).

**Date**: 20th October 2024.

**Location**: Detroit, MI and Windsor, ON.

**Time**: 3:29:XX.

**Background**:

I (male aged 25-29) casually ran cross country and track in high school and then sporadically ran on the treadmill for the following few years. My real running journey began in late summer of 2021 when a friend of mine convinced me to sign up for the local half-marathon. With three months to train from zero to 13.1 miles, I ran without a training plan, fell pretty in love with the sport, and achieved on the November race day a time of sub 2 hours on the hilly course. While I was very pleased with my performance, I (likely due to improper footwear and illogical training techniques) felt burnt out and completely stopped running for the next 8 months.

Then August 2022 rolled around and the cycle repeated - zero to HM followed by no more running. In August of 2023 the cycle began again but this time I decided to follow Hal Higdon's intermediate half-marathon training plan and get a more cushioned pair of shoes. The results were staggeringly different this time around. I achieved a final result of 1:42:XX and, once the race was over, felt hungry for more running rather than fizzled out.

Not too long after my third HM, I signed up for the May 2024 Pittsburgh Marathon. I elected to follow Hal Higdon's intermediate marathon training plan for the 4 month training block. After some minor setbacks involving blisters in the first few weeks, I stuck to the plan religiously and had plenty of fun while doing so. Heading into the race, my goal time was sub 3:45:00.

I completely underestimated the beast that is the marathon distance. A combination of (1) humid and rainy weather, (2) a massive hill at mile 14, (3) poor choice of shoes (sorry On Cloudmonsters), and (4) insufficient nutrition (I only consumed 2 puree fruit pouches and a few electrolyte drinks from the fluid stations) led to bonk at mile 17! Prior to this I was on pace for my goal time, but hitting the wall forced me to run walk the remaining 9 miles. I finished with a time of 3:53:XX and, while proud that I could accomplish the marathon,  frankly was a bit disappointed with the result. I knew I wanted to try this again and I pretty much immediately set my sights on the October 2024 Detroit Marathon.

**Training**:

My second marathon training block began on the first of July 2024. This time around I used Hanson's advanced marathon plan and I set myself a goal time of sub 3:30:00. I had to skip the first two weeks because I miscalculated when I should start and I missed 9 days of training in the beginning of August due to vacation. Other than these instances, I never missed a workout and I occasionally added few easy miles. During this time I also began experimenting with shoes more seriously and I found that my flat feet quite like the brands Altra and Karhu. It was a bit of a learning curve with the Altras as I was not used to the low drop at first. But the strength improvements made in my feet and calves and the substantial room in my toe box were much appreciated.

While I didn't dislike Higdon's plans while doing it, I found Hanson's plan to be more enjoyable and better suited to improving my fitness. Most of the days of the week are medium-long easy paced runs and this built up my aerobic base without injury or mental fatigue. Two days of the week are speedwork (intervals on Tuesdays and a marathon pace run on Thursday) and these are separated by a rest/cross-training day (on which I either biked or swam). The fact that the Sunday long run Hanson's plan tops out at just 16 miles was also a positive in my opinion as I felt the quicker recovery time led to a more productive cycle.

I typically did my easy and long runs at a 8:50 - 9:30 min/mi pace, my later Tuesday interval workouts at a 7:00 -- 7:40 min/mi pace, and my Thursday marathon goal pace runs at 7:50 min/mi. Coming into the October race, I felt super prepared - much more than I did for my first marathon.

**Gear**:

My shoes were the Altra Experience Flow. My on-person nutrition was 6 Hüma Gels.

**Race Experience**:

I would highly recommend the Detroit marathon! The course is very scenic, crosses the US-Canada border, is relatively flat, and is well-staffed with fluid and nutrition stations. The crowds were amazing and super supportive. The race starts at 7:00 am which is about 50 min before sunrise. While crossing the Ambassador Bridge at about mile 2.5, we were treated to beautiful views of Michigan and Ontario. The only (extremely minor) complaint I have about the course is the underwater tunnel crossing back into Detroit from Windsor gets quite warm (and I lost GPS signal here).

Pre-race I had some oatmeal, waffles, water, and a coffee. I was determined not to bonk this marathon and so I made a plan to consume a gel at miles 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, and 23, have either water or Gatorade at every fluid station I came across, and maintain a steady but somewhat conservative pace of 8:00 min/mi in the first 14 miles.

I ran the first three miles at an 8:05 min/mi pace and then stepped it up to a 7:55 min/mi average until mile 14 when I had to take a 20 second porta-potty break. After that I held a steady 7:50 min/mi until mile 22. I was super excited about how good I was feeling - I had no pains and seemed to have evaded the wall with my frequent gel consumption. But then the marathon distance started to fight back: My legs began to fatigue and my heartrate increased from 167 avg to 177 avg. Consequentially, my pace dropped to 8:02 min/mi and my high spirits began drift away (I also decided to skip consuming my final gel at mile 23 as I wasn't sure if I could handle another).

I tried my best to stay positive, keep a smile on my face, take energy from the crowds, and remind myself that it is a privilege to be out here running. This worked and by mile 25 I dropped my pace down to 7:45 min/mi. This was followed by a ""sprint"" to the finish for the last fifth of a mile. I was very pleased to have achieved my goal time by just a few seconds. This was overall a wonderful and humbling experience.

My quads and ankles got the lion's share of the soreness and I am very thankful to not have an injury, shin pain, or knee pain.

But there’s something about mystery that pulls you in, and before you know it, you’re in too deep. That’s exactly what happened with Lila. I met her one rainy afternoon, under the awning of a little coffee shop I’d never noticed before.

It wasn’t supposed to be a memorable day. In fact, everything had been utterly ordinary. Work was the same dull routine; my boss had complained about the same things he always did. I went through the motions, and by 6 p.m., all I wanted was a quiet cup of coffee before heading home to my boring apartment.

I ducked into the coffee shop because it was pouring outside, and I hadn’t brought an umbrella. The place was almost empty, except for her. She sat by the window, looking out into the street, her fingers tracing the rim of a coffee cup that seemed to have gone cold a long time ago.

She was beautiful, in that classic, old-movie kind of way. There was something timeless about her. I didn’t want to stare, but it was hard not to. Something about her just drew me in. So, I ordered my coffee, and when the barista handed me my cup, I found myself walking over to her table, half expecting her to look up and tell me she was waiting for someone. Instead, she just smiled.

“I’ve been waiting for you,” she said.

It felt like a line out of some cheesy romance novel, but the way she said it, so calm and certain, made me freeze. I had no idea what to say. Had I met her before? Was she mistaking me for someone else?

“I’m sorry, do we—?”

“No,” she cut me off. “But we will.”

I couldn’t help but laugh, feeling a little thrown off but intrigued. I sat down across from her, and just like that, it felt like the most natural thing in the world. We talked for hours, about nothing and everything at once. I learned that she liked old records and rainy days. She told me she loved walking the city at night, when the streets were quiet and everyone else was asleep. But the weird thing was, she never talked about herself. Not really. She asked me a hundred questions, made me feel like I was the most interesting person in the world. But every time I tried to turn the conversation back to her, she’d change the subject.

By the time I realized how late it was, the rain had stopped, and the coffee shop was closing. We said goodbye, and as I watched her walk away, I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something more to her. Something just out of reach.

Over the next few weeks, I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I went back to that coffee shop every day, hoping I’d run into her again. And then, finally, on a Tuesday afternoon, there she was, sitting in the same spot by the window, her coffee untouched.

“I knew you’d come back,” she said when I sat down.

From that day on, it became a routine. We’d meet at the coffee shop, always in the late afternoon, always after the rain. We’d talk for hours, and then she’d disappear, never giving me her number or telling me where she lived. It was strange, but I didn’t care. I was falling for her. Hard.

But then, things started getting… weird.

One night, after one of our usual coffee dates, I decided to walk her home. It had been raining, of course, and the streets were slick with water, reflecting the dull glow of the streetlights. Lila walked beside me, silent for the first time since we’d met. She seemed distant, her eyes fixed ahead, like she was looking at something only she could see.

“Where do you live, anyway?” I asked, half-joking. “You never let me walk you home.”

She glanced at me, her smile fading slightly. “You wouldn’t understand.”

“What do you mean? Try me.”

She hesitated, biting her lip like she was trying to find the right words. “It’s not like where you live,” she said softly. “I can’t really explain it. I’m not… from here.”

Problem is, ever since I went on T my face is like 5+ years older. My previous natty face was more attractive, jaw was sharper, features more pronounced and much more youthful, **even in January when I was fat.**

Seems I can split it into 2 separate ""issues"":

1. It is rounder and doughy. There's always puffiness around the eyes and bags under them are exaggerated.  Basically moon face. It's also red AF. I always went red easily but its off the charts now, and often pink even at rest.
2. There's also just thick veins around the temples and just a general more rough, masculine but haggard look. Hard to describe but it's the type of TRT face you see on people like Andrew Huberman.

I've tried:

* Using aromasin on and off, sometimes taking my estrogen super low.
* Lowering dosage to 140mg.
* Switching from cyp to E and to prop.
* Switching brands.
* Lowering dosage even more to 100mg (Just feel more tired now with still a puffy face).
* Using DHTs Anavar, Primo, Mast -  Didn't help 1) at all and made 2) worse.
* 40 days without even 1 drop of alcohol.
* 40 days without even 1 drop of coffee/caffeine.
* Lowering sodium.
* Taking Dandelion root extract for diruetic.
* Taking Nattokinase for RBC lowering (has helped shin pumps tremendously but not fixed face).
* Taking loads of other supplements.
* Taking no supplements at all.
* Walking a lot every day.
* Running nearly every day.
* Regular sauna.
* Getting more potassium and magnesium.
* Injecting at every different frequency known to man 
*  Injecting subq and IM

Probably some more stuff I can't even remember now.  Only known thing I haven't tried is just going Keto, because I did it for 2 years and I hate keto.

So before I just come off this shit and go back to natty, has anyone managed to fix this issue without coming off, and how did you do it?",0,1729607254.0,Testosterone,8,0.33,False

1g9j86x,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1g9j86x/updatedo_do/,Update-Do do? ,"Hi-I wrote the other week about that woman that I have known for years and has other underlying health issues (Not an issue for me). She reached out to me, we started talking alot for few weeks. Met up. Thought it was a wonderful evening, etc. Then she had a flare up, soon after,  (we never talked about what to do or what I need to do if she had flare-ups)  then the communication/texting went kaput. Still don't know if she thought I ghosted her.

You guys said to reach out to her and ask her, so I sent her a text saying Im glad you had fun and got to go out while feeling better (she says it is hard on her but whenever it hits her feeling good, she goes out). And that I miss her (keep it low key) and that I'd like to meet up for coffee with her etc. She said sure we can do that!! Then I was like, would later today work for you? (Since she was off work that day-Monday-Fed holiday) but she had family plans made already. So I redid my morning texts to her (That I hadn't done when she had her flare ups etc) and she responded back. Then last Thurs, I asked when she would like to meet up for coffee....silence. Ugh. Then saw her recent post on FB talking about leaving things up to God etc...so that kind of told me maybe she is dealing with stuff in her life currently. (also find it strange that before we met, she rarely posted on FB, after we met, bunch of posts??)

Anyway. It is tough because I do have feelings for her and I have no idea what is going on. So tempting to text her to ask if I did anything wrong or was bit too eager or whatever (but then it might push her away) or just wait since its basically her turn to text back or let me know per coffee whenever she's feeling ready or up to it. (she has reached out to me before) (I know she has alot of other things to deal with other than her condition) and want to be respectful of that.  Damn if I do, damn if I don't. Sigh. Like, dont know if she is scared of new feels? Or think I'll hurt her if we get close with her condition then I bolt when it is too much? Etc.  Ugh. I can't assume, but I guess the best thing for now is to wait.

And-If you were truly ghosting someone you actually knew. Would you remove that person from your social media?? Or leave them in there? I know it is different with a stranger. Easy to ghost, bye bye see ya later.",0,1729606651.0,datingoverforty,11,0.5,False
1g9j80e,https://i.redd.it/dxrle2cjgbwd1.jpeg,Review of Al Rehab choco musk ,"Bought it recently from Muzzamil Bhai for 650 the packaging was bullet proof, felt like cutting through a tank but after reaching the perfume it was all worth it, when I sprayed it initially it was a bit alcoholic ofcourse felt like rum cake or something after settling for a minute or two it changed into chocolate with vanilla more like a bakery with freshly baked chocolate cake with vanilla icing of sorts, on my skin (very dry) it isn't lasting as long but compared to other perfumes and clones that I have this is much stronger I can smell it while walking which is something I can't say for other perfumes I own I can feel it radiating off my body, if someone can suggest some ways I can make my perfumes last longer would be very helpful, I usually apply them after taking a bath and moisturizing my body it feels like my skin just drinks everything I apply to it, nevertheless I liked it very much, I can't say about projection but longevity is very good (compared to other perfumes I own) and smells very nice, I also bought Ahmed Al maghribi kaaf from Muzzamil Bhai will try that out when it arrives as well I feel that should last longer than this, these are my first middle eastern perfumes wanted to get khamrah qahwa as well as I've smelt clone of khamrah and liked it but was a bit too sweet for me so I think the coffee in qahwa will be better I'd like some suggestions for other middle eastern perfumes as well am planning to get some more for myself.",20,1729606637.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,14,0.96,False
1g9j74q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1g9j74q/aita_if_i_have_this_coffee/,AITA if I have this coffee ?,"For the context, I (F23) live on my Uni campus near NY. My BF (M24) lives in the city, outsider of the campus. I mostly hang out with friends in Uni, but none of them lives near my apartment.
Last week, I was waiting for a friend of mine, lets call her Laura. I was scrolling near my apartment, waiting for her to climb up the stairs. Then a guy (H25) who used to have the same class as me two years ago comes by, and starts chatting with me. Im easily embarrassed in front of people I dont really know, and tried to look friendly enough, but not too much. I scrolled from time to time to make him understand I was not really interested in chatting right now. Conversation was really weird, as we dont have anything in common, except this class we had two years ago, once a week (and we never talked, not even once). Laura arrived late, but I grabbed her, said goodbye to the guy, saying something like ""see you around sometime"" and left.
I then entered my room with Laura. We laughed about how uneasy I was, but the discussion went on.
That evening, he asked me as a friend on FB. I did not answered, as I never do so with people I dont know well. 

Fast forward to yesterday night. I come home and have donner at 9pm. I never go in the common spaces of the Uni campus : I have my own kitchen and I shower outside of the hours people usually do (not at ease with sharing the common showers with anyone I dont know, even when I dont see the person and they dont see me. I am really a shy person and a happy loner)
Then I hear knocking on my door. I am taken aback because no one ever comes knocking to my apartment, as I am not the kind of person to tell where I live, except to my closest friends who wouldnt disturb me anyway, exception made when there is a problematic issue.
I see through the peephole that it's this guy. He has probably heard me coming to the door, so I grab my phone and pretend I'm chatting with some friend, in order to deal with the situation as quickly as possible. I open the door and he sees I'm on the phone, but tells me he was looping forward to meeting me again, and was wondering if we could see each other sometime. He adds that he has seen me through the window, as he was in the cafeteria facing my apartment, and that thats why he came. 
I tried to play it cool but was in total panic, so I told him we could grab coffee sometimes. I quickly thought and told him I was on campus Sunday (i have lunch with a friend). I was about to go back inside, but he insisted upon having a way to contact me. He mentioned he had asked me on FB but that I didnt answer. I told him I would have a look at that, and left wishing him a good night. 

I was totally creeped by the fact he knew where I lived, and that he knew how to see in my apartment. He necessarily has to have seen me head into with Laura when we first had a talk, or maybe he found the info somewhere.
In front of him, I tried to play it cool, but later that night, I had a look through the window, and I am pretty sure I saw him looking through the window. But I moved quickly. 
I realized later on how not normal it must be, coming at people's doors at 9pm, mentioning you've seen them through the window. 
 Later that night, my BF went to say hello, and I told him about the guy. We agreed that was pretty creepy and I had to make things clear. 

So today I sent him a message on FB, telling that I had to tell him I have a BF and had not had the time to think about what my proposition to grab a Coffee could meant to him. I insister I wanted no confusion here.

He answered few hours ago, telling that it was a good thing that I told him before we have a Coffee. He added that he wouldnt have asked to meet me again if he had any special thing in mind, and that he was still okay for having a Coffee with me on Sunday. 
I honestly hoped he would get the idea that I was not interested when I told him I was in a relationship. 

I dont wanna play fool here, and I dont want people to think I am a total freak thinking he wants to date me - maybe he doesnt want to. But it's really a weird situation where I feel stuck, as I am the one who proposed the idea of a coffee in the first place. And I dont want that guy living on the same floor as I do to try to make me explain myself if I say I dont want to. I want peace and clarity, and I thought having a short coffee with him (10-15 min) could be enough for me to feel okay with the situation, and to call it a day, as I dont intend to accept another coffee. I live on that campus  until june and I dont want to be bothered every day by the thought he may be seeing me (watching me ?) through the window. Thats why I try to handle things nicely but firmly

My BF thinks I am naive and a fool, and that that boy wont give up too quickly. He tells me not to go, as that boy will try to get to me in another way, including being friendly, if he knows that I wont ""date"" anyone. 

So, AITA if I try to make things right by going to have a coffee with that guy and, if I believe that will do the trick ? 

PS : if youre the guy in question and that you see this post, please understand that such manners can creep people out, especially girls

I don't have a ton of things I want so when I do I usually just buy them myself, and I feel weird asking for specific items even though they're not expensive or difficult to aquire. As a result, in the past when I've been asked what I want for Christmas by relatives I've admittedly not given great answers and usually end up with generic things like gift cards and coffee. However, this past year for Christmas and my birthday I recieved almost exclusively gift cards to stores that I do not shop at. I accept that this is my fault for not giving good answers, so this year now that people have started asking I've been more explicit and responded with things like a blu ray for a movie I like or something at a similar pricepoint. Would I be a dick to also mention that I've stopped shopping at a lot of the frequent gift card stores like Amazon, Starbucks or Best Buy? I don't want to appear ungrateful for last years gifts because I did end up using them even if I did have to go out of my way to do so, but I know I wouldn't want to give someone a gift they weren't going to have much use for.",1,1729606516.0,Advice,5,0.67,False
