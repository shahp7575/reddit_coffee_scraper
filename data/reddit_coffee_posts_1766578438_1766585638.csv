1puo99n,https://i.redd.it/86fuxfomt59g1.jpeg,Help me to understand the hype for DAK,"Recently I had the opportunity to get a couple of DAK coffees which I often see here. I’m from Italy so I normally buy from local roasters, but since literally everyone here is trying DAK I wanted to give it a shot. 

Cardamom Bum 

I don’t understand here what’s exceptional about it. It’s a co-fermented coffee so you get what they used in the fermentation process. In this case.. well not surprisingly.. cinnamon and cardamom. 

Milky Cake 

It’s a very sweet coffee that went through anaerobic fermentation and thermal shock. I like it a lot but it’s not the first time I’ve tried something like that 

I’ve brewed them with Chemex and my ZP6, with the usual 1:15 to 1:16 coffee to water ratio. 

What I mean is, ok they are good coffee but nothing special I can’t find anywhere else. There are even a few Italian roasters which deliver similar coffees. I don’t understand why literally everyone here is obsessed with DAK. 

Having said that, enjoy your holidays with your favourite coffee and family. That’s all that matters. Cheers  ",2,1766585483.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

It seems to be well made and consists of several machined parts and tubing and seals.   Both a 1 and 3 hole tip come with it.  It fits nicley onto the machine and makes great foam.

I am a novice at this so I am still learning but it definitely stepped up my milk frothing game.  Any tips or comments are welcome.  This is my first machine and I have had it for a few months but I am already thinking of going more manual at home and taking this one to my office!

1puo6xh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1puo6xh/healing_from_the_heartbreak_of_loving_a_recovery/,Healing from the heartbreak of loving a recovery alcoholic,"I’m new here and would I’d love some advice on how to heal from the heartbreak of loving a recovering alcoholic. 
I recently came out of an abusive marriage and met my now ex boyfriend while in the final process of my divorce being finalized. He had just gotten out of a relationship with a woman in a similar situation and was concerned about me still being technically married because his ex girlfriend had kept their relationship a secret and he didn’t want to repeat the pattern (this is important for later on).  

I did my best to be available to him and try not be secretive, although I was concerned my ex would find out so I did keep this new relationship quiet from certain people for my own safety. My boyfriend was amazing for the first few months, he would bring me coffee to work in the morning, dinners out, thoughtful gifts, we had a really strong connection. He told me I was good for him, I’m a very calm and steady person by nature. I even traveled with him for work, met his parents. Our kids all hung out and loved each other. I actually for the first time felt safe with a man and I fell in love with him. He told me he loved me, he had a strong desire to provide for me and protect me. It all felt genuine. And then he changed. He was moody, started to pick fights with me, he was distant and cold. Then he would come back and be warm and loving. I thought maybe it was part of his recovery process (he has relapsed a year prior). So I tried to be kind and patient and loving. But his mood was continuing to be distant. I finally asked him one night what was wrong and he said he was feeling like he needed a break because he was still struggling with the fact that I am legally married. And he felt behind on his growth as a man. But he said he wanted a relationship with me and wanted to grow so this could be the last relationship we both have. He also mentioned that both his therapist and sponsor think he has a hard time being alone. So while we both wait for the divorce to finalize he could focus on being alone to heal. I was heartbroken but supportive. I told him his recovery is the most important part of his life and I didn’t want to get in the way of that. He said he wanted me in his life and he didn’t want to lose me but felt this was the right thing.

So we take a break but I was hopeful we’d get back together. He was still going to the coffee shop my daughter works at, we’d see each other at the gym and there was love and connection. But I was giving him the space he asked for. And then a week ago I saw him and his eyes were different, and I knew something had changed. He unfollowed me on social media and recently got back with his ex girlfriend (the one mentioned above). When I found out I almost threw up and couldn’t stop crying. I feel so stupid, I didn’t see the red flags and I still don’t understand how it changed so quickly. I want to reach out for answers but my friends are saying to walk away. If you have any help or advice I’d appreciate it. ",1,1766585295.0,AlAnon,1,1.0,False

I eat a banana and coffee calorie smoothie before working out and about 30 grammes of whey isolate afterward.  
I used to gym in uni gym, where I train very low volume for very heavy weights. (cause that's what all the social medias tell nowadays)  
I just came home for a small break and joined a commercial gym nearby.

Every exercise at my gym has three sets and fifteen repetitions, with at least five exercises for each muscle group. For instance:

* **Back:** lat pulldown, cable rows, T-bar row, chest-supported row, back extensions
* **Chest:** pec fly, seated incline machine press, flat bench machine press, another incline machine press, high-to-low cable fly
* **Biceps:** DB curls, hammer curls, machine preacher, straight bar curls, cable curls
* **Triceps:** pushdowns, seated dip machine, V-bar pushdown, DB overhead extension, reverse pushdown

In a single session, that equates to about 15 sets per muscle at 12–15 repetitions, frequently near failure. I don't have a big issue with this, like I don't feel sore or tired. But I personally prefer lower volume, heavier loading, and I'm not sure if this much volume is ideal for someone who is training natural. With these much sets, by the last sets I have to down the weights really low and from what I have learned, the overdone sets are just going to give lot of fatigue and simply won't be the best way to gain muscle mass, especially for a natural builder.

I workout each muscle group 2x a week, for example back on monday and thursday. Chest on tuesday and Friday.

Returned them, decided I’d try the AirPods 4 with ANC coz the pros had the inner silicone which I hate, these are the perfect earphones for me, the anc works really well and just enough for a good editing session, I can actually hear the video!

I’m planning a one‑month solo trip through China from late August to September, traveling mostly by train. I’d love some advice from locals or anyone familiar with these regions. My route is still very flexible, so suggestions are very welcome.

Before China, I’ll be traveling around Southeast Asia, so I can start my trip in China almost anywhere. I’m especially interested in big mountains, hiking, nature, culture, and meeting people. I researched Tibet a lot, but since independent travel isn’t possible and group tours are out of my budget, I’m looking for alternatives with great landscapes.

Right now I’m thinking about starting in Kunming or Chengdu, then heading to Chongqing → Zhangjiajie → Guilin/Yangshuo, and finally ending in Hong Kong, where my flight home departs.


I would love do get some advice on the following topics: 

Local recommendations for food, neighborhoods, viewpoints, or hidden spots that first‑time visitors often miss
Advice for solo female travel in China — safety, cultural tips, things to be aware of
Train travel guidance: best apps, how early to book, sleeper train tips, and whether my route makes sense by rail
Mountain or hiking suggestions, especially around Yunnan or Sichuan

And if anyone from these cities would be open to showing me around, grabbing a coffee or hotpot, or just chatting for a bit, I’d love to meet people along the way!
I’m also learning some basic Chinese, so I’m happy to practice simple phrases.

This is a bit of a niche ask, but I’m hoping it lands with the right person.

I’m looking for an old or beat-up RTIC or Yeti hard cooler that someone is getting rid of. Cosmetic damage is totally fine — scratches, dents, sun-faded, stickers, etc. are all no problem.

What matters: 

• The interior basin isn’t cracked 

• The lid itself isn’t structurally cracked (I’m okay modifying it, but it needs to start intact)

This is for a prototype / proof-of-concept project, and I’ll likely be cutting and modifying the lid to test different approaches. Because of that, I don’t want to risk or waste a good cooler.

Happy to: 

• Pick up locally 

• Toss a few dollars your way 

• Or trade beer / coffee / gratitude, depending on what’s appropriate

I read through, but my intent is not to circumvent rules.

This is a bit of a niche ask, but I’m hoping it lands with the right person.

I’m looking for an old or beat-up RTIC or Yeti hard cooler that someone is getting rid of. Cosmetic damage is totally fine — scratches, dents, sun-faded, stickers, etc. are all no problem.

What matters:

	•The interior basin isn’t cracked

	•The lid itself isn’t structurally cracked (I’m okay modifying it, but it needs to start intact)

This is for a prototype / proof-of-concept project, and I’ll likely be cutting and modifying the lid to test different approaches. Because of that, I don’t want to risk or waste a good cooler.

Happy to:

	•Pick up locally

	•Toss a few doll hairs your way

	•Or trade beer / coffee /gratitude, depending on what’s appropriate

If you’ve got one that’s been relegated to the garage, backyard, or “too beat to bother selling,” I’d love to give it a second life.

1puny3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedFounders/comments/1puny3k/20_burning_questions_founders_have_about/,20 Burning Questions Founders Have About Marketing + My Answers,"Marketing a startup is messy, confusing, and feels like shouting into the void. 

Believe me, I know.

I have been there with no budget. No awareness. No pedigree. Nothing. 

But what’s great about startup marketing is you have the freedom to take chances.

You can be unique, different, or even outlandish. You can also employ new tools or strategies, and if done correctly, win.

These are 20 of the most common questions founders ask me, along with the answers I typically give when we're sitting down over coffee (hopefully in Seattle, where the coffee is so, so good), so they can ‘pick my brain.’

# 1. We just launched, but no one knows we exist. How do we get our first 100 users?

You do whatever it takes. Full stop.

Talk to people directly. DM potential users on LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, or on relevant Slack communities, and offer them free trials. Post content on social media, send emails, go to events, or go door to door. Get your friends and family to use it. Early traction comes from hustle, not scalable channels.

# 2. Everyone says “content is king.” But what kind of content actually works for SaaS in the early days?

Teach, don’t preach. Create how-to posts, mini case studies, or short Loom videos showing how you solve a painful problem. Keep it practical and tactical.

# 3. Should we focus on SEO and AEO now, or is it too early?

It’s too early for a big SEO or AEO (AI Engine Optimization) play. However, you should focus on quick wins, including your homepage, blogs, and key landing pages, by targeting obvious keywords, like your company name. 

The primary goal is to build authority with content that succinctly explains your value proposition.

# 4. Is social media worth it for SaaS, or should we double down on direct outreach instead?

Do both. Build your authority on social media and use those channels to find prospects and reach out to them directly. If you only do social, you will never close anyone. If you only do direct outreach, you will never grow your brand value and ACV (Average Contact Value).

# 5. How do I know which growth channel is going to work best for us?

Most will advise running small tests across two to three channels and focusing on the ones that work. False. 

This is biased towards a digital-first approach. Instead, use first principles and think deeply about who your target customers are. And then use the channels they use to find them. Not everyone is online. It might be events or door-to-door sales. The fallacy of growth hacking is that all customers are accessible on the internet. They aren’t.

# 6. Our product solves multiple problems. How do I decide what core message to lead with?

Start with the most painful, most expensive problem for your target user. Lead with that. The rest can come later.

# 7. What’s the fastest way to figure out if our messaging resonates with our target audience?

DM 10 to 20 people you think are in your target audience, a headline, or a JPG, and ask, “Would you buy this?” Brutal honesty beats A/B testing at the start.

# 8. Everyone in our space sounds the same. How do we stand out

Every industry has its jargon and terms. It is crucial to demonstrate you have the insider knowledge by using it to establish credibility. But you also need to take risks by being bold, conversational, and funny.

# 9. Do we really need a niche right away, or can we try to go broad at first?

Yes, it will be next to impossible if you go too broad in the beginning. By appealing to everyone, you appeal to no one.

Niche down and think deeply about your market entry and growth strategy. You want to create a narrative and path that allows for future expansion. Facebook’s Ivy League to universities to high schools to the general public is one of the most well-executed examples of a niche strategy that systematically scaled up.

# 10. Should I pitch features or outcomes when I talk about our product?

Always outcomes. People don’t buy “AI dashboards,” they buy “save 5 hours a week.”

# 11. Our homepage isn’t converting. What’s the single most important thing to fix first?

Your headline above the fold. If it doesn’t instantly explain who it’s for and what it does, people will bounce. 

# 12. How do I write a headline that actually makes people want to try the product?

It must be direct and succinct. You can try this formula: *\[Target user\] + \[pain\] + \[solution/outcome\].* Example: “For busy founders: Automate your reporting and win back 10 hours a week.” For my tips on copywriting, [read this.](https://vibeyoursaas.beehiiv.com/p/100-ways-to-write-better-copy)

# 13. Do testimonials matter? We don’t have a lot of customers or users.

Yes. One strong testimonial beats none. Even a simple “This saved me 3 hours” is gold.

# 14. Should we put pricing on the site, or make people “book a demo” first? 

I believe that pricing transparency builds trust and saves you time with tire-kickers. You can always offer custom enterprise pricing for large accounts.

# 15. If I only have $1,500 to spend, where should it go?

Spend it with someone who can help you avoid burning all that cash on an ad campaign that won’t work.

# 16. How do I test different pricing models without confusing my early users? 

Talk to users and run short experiments. Offer cohort A a free trial, and cohort B a paid plan. Don’t overcomplicate, keep it simple, and learn fast.

# 17. Should I try freemium, free trial, or paid plans first?

The era of freemium is over (mostly). It’s hard to monetize early unless you’ve got huge distribution. Free trials are the way to go.

# 18. Is offering discounts early on a bad idea?

No. Do whatever it takes to get early traction. I know I keep saying this, and I am serious. You do what it takes. No excuses.

However, I would encourage finding value-added ways to make the deal attractive, such as an extended free trial or more services instead of discounts.

# 19. How can I turn our early users into advocates who help spread the word?

Overdeliver. Get them on Slack and respond quickly, offer personal support, and publicly celebrate their wins. Happy customers talk.

# 20. Should I build a community (Slack/Discord/LinkedIn group), or is that a distraction at this stage? 

It’s a distraction unless your product is community-driven and you have a knack for building these, but then you wouldn’t be asking this question, would you?

At first, focus on product-market fit and then go hard on social media and direct outreach. The community can come later.

# 21. You didn’t address my questions?

Yeah? No problem. Just reply and let me know what questions I missed.",1,1766584588.0,ExperiencedFounders,0,1.0,False

Like espresso epiphany. 
And every time I was like ok this is the good settings to dial these beans I can reproduce that exquisite chocolate taste so that my partner can be proud of me.
Then the next shot is barely Ok with the same settings, it is a bit frustrating.

I grind with a manual 1zpresspo grinder, scale beans before and coffee outside of press, I had acidity issues at first so now I sometimes pre-heat a bit. I use a toothpick as a getto WST and am quite carefull with leveling my tamper with the default tamper. With medium roast I tend to use filter on top of the coffee too.

1punu4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1punu4x/i_picked_up_a_habit_in_my_30s_that_20_year_old_me/,I picked up a habit in my 30s that 20 year old me would have roasted relentlessly,"If you told me ten years ago that I’d willingly wake up early on weekends without an alarm, I would’ve laughed in your face. Back then sleeping in was sacred. Waking up before noon on a day off felt like a personal failure. Now I’m in my early 30s and somehow I’ve turned into a guy who opens his eyes at 7am on a Saturday, stretches, and thinks “nice”. No panic, no rush, no obligation. I don’t even do anything productive most of the time. I’ll make coffee slower than necessary, stand by the window like I’m in some low budget indie movie, and just exist for a bit. Old me would’ve called this boring, pointless, or depressing. Present me finds it weirdly grounding. The silence hits different when you know you didn’t have to be up. I used to chase that feeling of freedom by staying up late. Now I get it from being awake early with nothing demanding my attention.

What really gets me is how quietly this change happened. There was no decision, no “I’m becoming this guy now” moment. One day I just noticed I didn’t feel robbed when I woke up early anymore. I felt calm. A little smug even. I still enjoy sleeping in sometimes, but I don’t crave it the way I used to. My priorities didn’t flip overnight, they just softened. I don’t need every free hour to feel loud or exciting to feel worth it. There’s something satisfying about these small, almost invisible routines that no one sees or cares about. Younger me thought adulthood meant losing fun. Turns out it just means finding it in quieter places. I’m not saying I’ve got life figured out or anything dramatic like that, but it’s funny realizing the things you once mocked end up being exactly what you need later.

And something inside me has changed forever.

  
Studying stopped being about “what if?” and “wow, I wonder why?” It became about “which grade?” Now, I’m reading just to memorize information, use it on a test and get it out of my head. Not to get a fresh idea, but to pass an assignment. And as deadlines piled up, the only thing I could think about was where to find homework help just to get through the semester.  
The irony is that the world outside of university NEEDS our curiosity. People don't ask what your score was, they ask, ""what do you know? what do you think?"" But the system seems to train us for tests only.  
  
Sometimes I think: if we were allowed to make more mistakes, explore more, be less afraid, we wouldn't be looking for assignment help on the last night. But thanks to services like EssayPro, we have a lot less stress than we could have.

Or have I? Is this really cheating? 

Long story short, some time ago I started talking to an engaged coworker of mine, nothing serious. A few weeks in and we’ve ended up taking A LOT about literally everything, sharing some intimate details of our lives, meeting in secrecy just to have a coffee and talk. There was never any romantic thing going on whatsoever, but we both hid it from our partners, there’s no point in denying that, as well as admitting that I really like her and I suppose she likes me.

I love my girlfriend, I do care about her and I feel like an absolute di\\\*khead for doing that. I was thinking on why am I doing this and I feel like I just don’t feel understood in my relationship when it comes to… life? My girlfriend has always avoided many topics, especially deep ones as they make her sad, cry and she just hates talking about them. I on the other hand mainly talk about such things, love theoretizing about everything, I just enjoy talking about something more that what I’d like to eat or where I’d like to go. This sh\\\*t sounds cruel but I did come to this realization after a long time - my girlfriend literally can’t talk about anything other than what she would like to do, have or eat. Anything else is too hard for her and makes her cry or starts a mood swing.

I knew my girlfriend is like that, it’s not her fault nor have I ever expected her to change. There’s absolutely nothing wrong about her other than being very, very sensitive and emotional which makes her everyday life hard - this is also what keeps her from being able to talk about anything serious as she starts breaking into tears, as “life’s too hard for her”. I talked to her about this many times for over a year, she refused going into therapy. I suggested going together, her and me, but her approach is (“I know it’s hard for me and you, but therapy requires work and I don’t want to put all my energy into something that scares me”). I sort of gave up after hearing that.

I don’t consider this an excuse, it’s simply the reason, not a way of justification. I had the same done to me twice in the past by girls. I would rather not know, to be honest. That’s why I want advice.

I guess I’ve reached a breaking point where… well I’m not even sure what the \\\* am I doing with my life and how to proceed from here. I’m meeting an engaged woman for late night drives and talks while mine nor her partner have any clue what’s going on.

I’m unsure on how to proceed and what to do about this entire situation.

tl;dr - I met and started talking with engaged coworker. This has turned into regular conversations and meetups that made me realize the issues I have in my current relationship aren’t as minor as I have thought. ",1,1766584195.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

I have been 100% sober for around 5 weeks now. I also eliminated coffee from my diet to reduce anxiety causing substances and get a clean slate to observe my body’s reaction to these lifestyle changes.

I used to sweat A LOT from my pits and my chest.
More specifically when I drove my car. I would arrive to work in the morning with huge sweat marks on my shirt, and when arriving back home after work it would be even worst. The excessive sweating would also stain many of my clothes, until it calmed down towards the end. (i also found an antiperspirant that works for me, which may have helped)

I now arrive to my destinations 100% dry, or with a miniscule amount of sweat. Nothing remotely close to what it was before. I also quit smoking last year for 7 months and I had the exact same results.
This leads me to believe the abuse of weed was messing up my nervous system and perhaps even body temperature control regulation. I had to quit because I often getting bad anxiety.

Everything was fine until I made a sillut mistake of trying to make chai latte the same way you would coffee. I put sticky chai latte leaves down the hopper. 

Ever since then I've been grinding coffee beans and they come out course. I decided to open up the main chassis to inspect the burrs and sure enough there was sticky chai leaves stuck on the burrs and the screws. I took them out and cleaned them with water to remove the sticky residue. The images show before and after cleaning

I reinstalled the burrs and but still, the beans grind too course even on a fine setting of 5. Is there something I need to do with calibration? 

I've email Acaia support but it's the holiday season so I'm not sure how long they would take to reply, or if they can help. 

Should I bring it to to a store to get it fixed instead?

1punl4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1punl4c/ashs_of_tomorrow/,Ash's of tomorrow,"Genera : action, mystery, dark, Psychological. 

The morning had been ordinary. Sunlight filtered through the windows of downtown apartments, streets buzzed with life, and the smell of coffee mingled with exhaust. For most, it was just another day. For Noha, twenty years old and oblivious to what would come, it was the last ordinary morning he would ever know.
Then the sky tore.
It began as a shimmer, a distortion over the horizon. People paused, squinting. Birds fell silent. And then it appeared: a Visitor, enormous and ethereal, hovering above the city like a storm given form. Its surface shifted between metal and shadow, bending the air around it. Cars skidded into each other. Civilians screamed and scattered. Emergency sirens rang out, too little too late. Soldiers mobilized, but their weapons seemed insignificant against the alien colossus.
Buildings shook and splintered. Windows shattered. The street beneath Noha’s feet quaked, throwing him to the ground. Around him, people vanished in bursts of light and distortion. Panic spread like wildfire, but no one could stop it.
From a high-rise observation deck, Dr. Hale watched calmly. Every order he gave over the comms sounded measured, heroic, reasonable. Yet behind the façade, his mind was already plotting. Every deployment, every tactical command, subtly nudged humanity toward a path only he and a few others understood. Humanity had survived this first encounter, but survival would become a far darker burden than they could imagine.
The Visitor withdrew by nightfall, leaving the city in ruins. Fires burned unchecked. Smoke choked the streets. Noha, trembling and covered in dust, stared at the devastation, knowing that life as it had been was gone forever.

Something you should know about the story

Visitors= alien colossus 
AEGIS = organization that fight Visitors
SOLACE = organization that funds AEGIS [high authority of world]
DEFENDERS =AEGIS soldiers and workers


Time Skip – Present


Decades later, the surface of Earth had become a grave. Humanity clung to life underground, in vast cities carved into the crust, beneath layers of reinforced steel and concrete. The sun was a memory; the sky, a myth. The surface was forbidden, a dangerous place for ghosts of a world that had died slowly over years of fighting.
Noha sat in AEGIS headquarters, the glow of tactical monitors washing over his face. His fingers hovered over the coordination panel, guiding squads, marking safe zones, logging casualties. He was not a soldier, not on the frontlines, but the weight of the battlefield pressed on him nonetheless. Each screen told a story of destruction: collapsed tunnels, incinerated squads, civilians trapped and lost. He memorized their names, because memory was all he had left of the living.
Another Visitor had appeared, massive and shifting, bending gravity and light. Squads deployed; many did not return. Noha’s eyes moved over the displays, calculating, coordinating, helpless. Each victory seemed hollow. Each defeat, a tragedy. And still, the battles came, relentless as the decay of the world itself.

After humanity moved underground, AEGIS began studying the distortions left behind by the Visitors—areas where sound bent and machines failed, as if the planet itself had been wounded. Dr. Hale called it resonance: a shared frequency between the Visitors and Earth.
Project LUCENT was approved to study it. Officially, the goal was simple—capture a Visitor, extract its core structure, and build a system capable of controlling or neutralizing them. SOLACE provided the funding, calling it a final hope for survival.
Deep beneath the city, a captured Visitor was suspended in containment. Its presence unsettled everyone nearby. Hale ignored the reports and focused on the data. When human neural signals synchronized with the creature’s frequency, the readings stabilized instead of collapsing.
From that discovery, the Resonance Core was created.
On paper, it was a weapon. In truth, Hale understood what it really did—it aligned all living signals into a single, quiet rhythm. No pain. No resistance. Just an ending that felt like rest.
He shared only what AEGIS needed to hear.
The rest of the truth waited.
And when Hale noticed that one young operator, Noha, could stand near the Core without flinching, he marked him quietly.
Some endings, after all, required a steady hand.

Over the following weeks, the underground city became a symphony of war. Sector 12 was engulfed in chaos as a Visitor ripped through the tunnels. Armor clanged against impossible force, yet it shattered. Soldiers fell mid-stride. Sector 7 saw evacuation squads ambushed; screams echoed through hollow conduits as civilians were lost. Sector 3’s tunnels collapsed entirely, trapping dozens beneath tons of concrete.
Noha moved like a ghost among the monitors, guiding what he could, witnessing everything he could not prevent. The names of the fallen haunted him, etched into memory like scars on his mind. Each loss deepened the gnawing realization: survival had become a form of cruelty.


Meanwhile, in the hidden chambers of power, SOLACE convened. The group of elites — scientists, philosophers, politicians — had long since realized that humanity’s continued survival was not mercy, but suffering. Dr. Hale, their secret ally within AEGIS, began manipulating the defenders with careful precision. He issued orders to capture a Visitor under the guise of weaponization, emphasizing safety protocols while hiding the true purpose of the mission.
For years, he guided humanity’s defenders toward a plan they could not comprehend. Every lie, every manipulation, was calculated to bring them closer to the inevitable end. Only the Core remained, waiting for someone with the authority to act — someone like Noha.
The signs were subtle at first. Visitors that were captured behaved curiously, observing rather than attacking. Protocols made little tactical sense. Dr. Hale’s private communications contained hints of a far-reaching plan. Slowly, as the battles continued and the casualties mounted, Noha began to piece it together.
The truth was chilling: the Visitors were not weapons. The Resonance Core was not a tool of war. It was a device to end humanity peacefully. SOLACE had decided that survival was cruelty, and Dr. Hale had agreed in secret, ensuring that the defenders remained unaware of their true purpose.
Noha’s heart sank as he realized the weight of what had been orchestrated, and the only question left was: who would give consent to activate it?
The Final Choice
The last Visitor had been captured. The Resonance Core glowed softly in the central chamber, awaiting the human touch that would decide the fate of all life. Outside, battles raged. Soldiers fell mid-strike, tunnels collapsed, and screams echoed in the dim underground corridors.
Noha approached the Core. He thought of the friends he had lost, of soldiers and civilians alike, of cities broken and lives ended. The screens reflected faces he would never forget. The full scope of humanity’s suffering pressed down on him.
He pressed the panel.
Time froze. The Visitors halted mid-motion, suspended in a quiet grace. Pain vanished. Fear dissolved. Suffering ceased. Life folded gently into silence.
Epilogue
Noha remained, the last conscious witness. The underground tunnels were still, the monitors dark. Humanity’s end had come, not with fire or chaos, but with mercy. And in that moment, Noha understood the truth of it all: sometimes, the greatest act of courage is choosing to let go.
The war was over. The world was over. And Noha, a boy who had watched from behind monitors, had chosen the final mercy for all.",0,1766583526.0,story,0,0.5,False

Every evening, I knew exactly what was coming: hours in bed, eyes closed, mind wide open. My body was exhausted, but my brain acted like it had just had five cups of coffee. I used to joke that nighttime was my personal version of hell, except it wasn’t funny when you had to function the next day.

I tried all the usual advice. “Go to bed earlier.” “Stop thinking.” “Just relax.” None of that helped. The more I tried to force sleep, the more impossible it became. Some nights I would finally fall asleep right before sunrise, only to wake up an hour later feeling worse than before. That constant sleep deprivation slowly broke me down mentally and emotionally.

What I didn’t realize at the time was that chronic stress and insomnia were draining my body. I wasn’t just tired — I was depleted. Over the years, important minerals like magnesium, calcium, and iron had quietly dropped, and my nervous system was stuck in survival mode. Once I understood that, my approach changed completely.

Instead of trying to knock myself out, I focused on calming my system. One of the biggest turning points was high-dose magnesium. In the beginning, I took around 500 mg per day. It didn’t sedate me or make me feel drugged. It simply slowed things down. My thoughts became less sharp, less urgent. Sleep stopped feeling like a battle.

I used FineMagTotal magnesium, which combines seven forms of magnesium in one capsule. I don’t know which form did what — I just know it worked faster than anything else I had tried. I also added iron and calcium-rich colostrum, not expecting miracles, just trying to rebuild what stress had taken away.

The “trick” wasn’t instant. It happened quietly. One night I realized I had fallen asleep without noticing it. Another night, I slept through without waking up at 3 a.m. Over weeks, my sleep went from light and broken to deep and restorative. When things stabilized, I lowered my magnesium dose to a maintenance level.

The real shock came during the day. My anxiety dropped. Crowds stopped scaring me. I could handle pressure without that constant internal shaking. It felt like my nervous system had finally learned how to turn off.

Looking back, the trick wasn’t magic. It was listening to my body instead of fighting it. Supporting it instead of forcing it. Sleep didn’t return because my life suddenly became perfect — sleep returned first, and then life became manageable again.

For me, that’s how my nights went from hell… to something that finally feels like heaven.",2,1766583298.0,sleephackers,4,0.75,False

The SF consumption conundrum.","I’ve been chatting with some visitors lately and it made me realize how confusing our laws actually are for people who don't live here. We have dispensaries on so many corners now, but as soon as you walk out the door with your bag, you technically aren't supposed to light up anywhere public. It feels like a bit of a trap if you don't know the lay of the land.

The biggest mistake I see people make is heading straight for the scenic spots like the Presidio, Ocean Beach, or Crissy Field. I always feel like I should step in and warn them that those are federal lands. The park rangers there follow federal law, not California law, so you can actually get a real ticket. It is not just a slap on the wrist like it might be elsewhere in the city.

Then there is the sidewalk situation. We all smell it walking around the city, so it feels permitted, but legally it is still a no go. I feel like most locals just follow the unwritten rule of not being a jerk about it. If you aren't blowing smoke in a doorway, near a playground, or in a crowd, people usually look the other way. But strictly speaking, you are taking a risk.

I honestly think the consumption lounges are the best option that people forget about. Places like Moe Greens or Barbary Coast are actually permitted for it. It feels a bit civilized to sit inside, have a coffee or a water, and not worry about looking over your shoulder. It is a lifesaver for renters who have strict landlords or tourists staying in hotels.

I am curious how you all handle this. Do you stick to edibles or vapes when you are out and about to be discreet? Has anyone actually seen someone get ticketed by the feds at the beach, or is that mostly just a scary rumor?",0,1766583259.0,AskSF,5,0.38,False

They don’t ask to be important.

They don’t warn you that they’ll stay.

That day was like that.

It began with small things; coffee, mostly.

At Roastary.

Too crowded now, you said. You don’t really go there anymore.

We waited outside for a bit, an awkward start but soon enough I was so absorbed in talking to you that I missed our turn in the queue entirely. By the time I realised, we were already late going in. I didn’t mind. I don’t think you did either.

I chose the indoor seating. A mistake, maybe. It was loud. I think now I would’ve picked outdoors. There was also a small fumble on my part, I should’ve offered you the chair first. I didn’t. Not because I didn’t care, but because I already felt strangely at ease around you, as if formalities had quietly stepped aside.

We ordered our first coffee, something new. New for me.

And then I noticed it, the way you placed a tissue under your glass so the table wouldn’t get wet. A gesture so ordinary it could’ve gone unnoticed. Except it didn’t. It told me something about you before I realised I was listening.

I kept the bill.

I still don’t know why.

Maybe I wanted proof the day wasn’t imagined.

There’s no picture from that day.

Only memory, doing its imperfect work.

We talked, and then we walked.

No destination in mind. Just movement. Just time stretching gently instead of rushing past us.

While we walked, you mentioned a Casio AQ240, how you wanted to try it on before deciding. I liked that about you. The patience in wanting to feel something before claiming it. I liked that you carried treats for cats. I liked that you loved animals. I do too.

We wandered again.

We found a spot by the lake at Rabindra Sarobar, letting the silence sit with us instead of filling it. You didn’t seem afraid of quiet. Neither was I; though at first I kept wondering what else to say, before realising you were perfectly content just being there.

Later you took me to Evabrew. Your go to cafe you said, between lavender coffee and banana chocolate cake, you recommended I watch Life of Chuck.

We shared a silence, broken only by my smile, an awkward realisation of the million tiny chances that had put me right there, that day, with you. I remember details I didn’t know I’d keep, the purple sweater, maroon lipstick, the way you placed your glasses down on the table, how you brushed your hair behind your ear when you listened. Your smile felt gentle, unguarded, your laugh effortless, something I didn’t want to interrupt. You showed me your knitted Mobius shawl, talked about your crafts. I don’t know if I said it clearly then, but you have so much talent. I remember you saying you wanted to have your own cafe someday or at least a good coffee machine of your own.

There was kindness in you that didn’t feel performative. Thoughtfulness that didn’t announce itself.

You spoke about books, art, anime, music, travel; not like interests on a list, but like things that had quietly shaped you.

Then we walked again while waiting for your auto. None came. And I remember thinking how lucky I was to get a little more time with you, just walking. Eventually the goodbye arrived, awkward as goodbyes often are when neither person wants the day to end. I know I didn’t.

I walked away knowing something had shifted, even if nothing had been promised.

I know it was only one date, and we barely spoke after. But that one day carried the weight of knowing someone for a long time, maybe even a lifetime.

Since then, I’ve realised I wasn’t only remembering you.

I was remembering a version of myself I hadn’t felt in a long time; alive, hopeful, motivated, open. Capable of joy again.

I wanted to share things I hadn’t shared with anyone. Not because I planned to, but because it felt safe. And afterward, something curious happened. I wanted more from myself. I wanted to work harder, learn instruments, read more, sing badly, live more honestly.

You felt like a dopamine rush, yes. But also like a mirror, showing me a version of myself I’d forgotten I could be.

If science were to explain it, it might say my nervous system recognized safety, novelty, and resonance all at once. That combination can feel spiritual. It can feel intoxicating. It can feel destabilising.

There’s a name for it. Limerence mixed with genuine connection. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t real.

It just means my emotions ran ahead while reality paused.

I don’t know where paths go when they diverge like this. I only know that crossing yours mattered to me.

That some meetings don’t turn into stories, but they still change the reader.

If our paths cross again someday, I’d welcome it.

And if they don’t, I’m still grateful we crossed at all.

Because for a while, walking beside you, the world felt a little quieter and I felt more myself than I had in a long time.

For a brief moment, I even wanted to believe in something larger than myself some quiet force that might look down and say, just this once, let him have what he wants. I’m an atheist. But hope has a way of borrowing language wherever it can.

That day you asked me if I wanted to write. I had said yes. That was true. I just never had the motivation before. Maybe it was you.

So I think we all agree some of those point, click, follow dude around his boring ass town ""quests"" are mindnumbingly boring. Especially how the game kinda forces you to pretend to be interested like how its literally your task to ask them about their town and it rarely even comes up later. However more than that Ive found some of the main premisses so dumb and even kinda patronizing that they made me infuriated.

So for example Waha Desher supposedly just forgor about a perfectly fine well that they used to use and is just chilling there... apparently they need you the player to realize that you can remove a few rocks and revitalize the island...

Like I am told that Enbesa is a proud and powerful kingdom but then you present me with these dinguses.

Or how Kidusi is supposedly so distrustful but they immediately trust some random stranger with their hidden knowledge after completing some basic ass riddle. And then they completely contradict their whole philosophy about valuing truth later and youre expected to defend them before the emperor to get the mechanically best outcome? And what were they even trying to accomplish with that faked artifact? justify getting more supplies? idk its a bit of a stretch. and to completely contradict their entire belief system for the dumbest intrigue made me just hate them so much.

The only tribe I didnt find annoying was Angereb because they dont trust you at first. (understandably) They do intrigue thats at least plausible and they dont call you to wipe their ass for them or smth. Also it actually looks like a working town. Like its worth the effort to integrate them.

Is it just me or does the portrayal of the other two tribes feel incredibly condescending though? Like oh no the silly africans need their european colonizer to notice the most obvious shit and save their kingdom. I would love to have seen a more hostile environment where you actually need to earn their trust first and their problems arent completely trivial.

Like maybe I would have to mediate a dispute between two tribes and I can either choose one side or pay massively myself to placate both. Or maybe theyre struggling because of global market competition (like say coffee competition with the new world, would also fit the loose connection to Ethiopia) and then you bring over a crop from the new world that can grow in enbesa well and revitalize the economy. And thats just two ideas i came up with in a minute.

For a heavily story based dlc the story left me entirely disappointed. Oh well I like the zoo items and I guess I can supply my investors with tapestries.

Long story short, some time ago I started talking to an engaged coworker of mine, nothing serious. A few weeks in and we’ve ended up taking A LOT about literally everything, sharing some intimate details of our lives, meeting in secrecy just to have a coffee and talk. There was never any romantic thing going on whatsoever, but we both hid it from our partners, there’s no point in denying that, as well as admitting that I really like her and I suppose she likes me.

I love my girlfriend, I do care about her and I feel like an absolute di\*khead for doing that. I was thinking on why am I doing this and I feel like I just don’t feel understood in my relationship when it comes to… life? My girlfriend has always avoided many topics, especially deep ones as they make her sad, cry and she just hates talking about them. I on the other hand mainly talk about such things, love theoretizing about everything, I just enjoy talking about something more that what I’d like to eat or where I’d like to go. This sh\*t sounds cruel but I did come to this realization after a long time - my girlfriend literally can’t talk about anything other than what she would like to do, have or eat. Anything else is too hard for her and makes her cry or starts a mood swing.

I knew my girlfriend is like that, it’s not her fault nor have I ever expected her to change. There’s absolutely nothing wrong about her other than being very, very sensitive and emotional which makes her everyday life hard - this is also what keeps her from being able to talk about anything serious as she starts breaking into tears, as “life’s too hard for her”. I talked to her about this many times for over a year, she refused going into therapy. I suggested going together, her and me, but her approach is (“I know it’s hard for me and you, but therapy requires work and I don’t want to put all my energy into something that scares me”). I sort of gave up after hearing that.

I guess I’ve reached a breaking point where… well I’m not even sure what the \* am I doing with my life and how to proceed from here. I’m meeting an engaged woman for late night drives and talks while mine nor her partner have any clue what’s going on.

A round table that softens the space without trying too hard.

It feels pretty complicated to try and/or incorporate in a sex life (I know my bf into that, so was also curious to try and see how it goes).

But as a person with stubborn stomach (mostly because anxiety) getting worried that it can be problematic to plan, prepare and practice without too much mess or without overcomplicated preparation. Cuz according to what I have found, the easiest way of getting prepared for people is to time it after using bathroom, some general cleaning and it should be fine. But any insights from people with anxiety or common constipations on how you deal with it and stuff?

Please let aside comments about adding fiber to the dite, training and drinking enough water, cuz it’s something I don’t feel helping unless I drank ton shit of coffee (which also worries me to not have control over the liquid state of poo after)

  
How do you feel it works mood wise, cuz you need to plan how it and there is no place to be spontaneous? We don’t usually plan any sex activities and I found this way of ’going with the flow’ more enjoyable for me.



In addition, I’m also curious about how the holding on poop power changes with the anal frequency?

Like, if you practice it ones a moth - do you have any noticeable difference in your daily (bathroom)life? Does it affects ability to hold it up only right after the sex (or like a day after)?

And what with practicing more/less often?



I also would appreciate any personal input or tips, thanks

I don’t know if I can continue to date a man whose idea of wooing a woman involves being chaperoned by his parents/siblings. Is it a green flag his family is tight knit? Unfortunately he is MUCH nicer when his family is around.,"I’m 30F and I’ve known this guy 30M for over 20 years. When we were growing up, he was always the one asking me to hang out. His parents’ house is near my parents’.

I’d go to his parents’ house and spend time with him and his family, and back then I was very accommodating and didn’t question much. Looking back, I was kind of stupid about my own boundaries.

About 4 years ago, after I had really bad breakup, he pushed hard for us to start dating. He had never dated anyone before me. At the time it felt safe because of the history, but now I’m not so sure.

Now I cannot stand the idea of spending my days off at his parents’ house. He plays video games and I watch. Maybe it’s because now I have my own adult $ and can just fly to Europe tomorrow if I wanted to.

They renovated their home but that doesn’t change how I feel. I have zero interest in talking to his parents anymore. They come off fake to me, and his siblings are extremely social climby and only talk about how successful they are or want to be. This didn’t bother me when I was younger, but now it really does.

He is constantly pressuring me to go over to his parents’ house whenever he’s home (he lives in nyc now which is 1.5 hours away from our hometown) instead of just meeting up like normal adults. I’ll suggest grabbing coffee at Starbucks or sitting at a cafe, and he’ll push back and say we should go to his parents’ place instead because coffee out is overpriced. Instead of actually going on a date, he microwaves leftovers his dad made the previous night. It feels less like dating and more like being absorbed into a family I don’t even enjoy.

The last time I went over, about 6 months ago, his parents and siblings all tried to pressure me into moving in with him. He lives in NYC, where rent is extremely expensive. They kept saying he pays $3500 which is half his take home pay. I don’t make NYC pay, I would struggle to afford half (a 2 bed is like $5k minimum? My mortgage now is $2200 and I’m already struggling), and honestly wouldnt want to share a studio with ANYONE and they made it sound like the two of us could live in a studio together. The whole thing felt like being cornered, not a conversation.

What really bothers me is that he seems to enjoy being chaperoned by his family. This didnt bother me as much when we were kids. He’ll call me, we’ll talk for a minute, and then he’ll hand the phone to his sister. Or he’ll meet me somewhere and his parents will come with him!!

I’m 30 years old and I don’t want to date someone whose family are always in the middle of our relationship.

I know I’ve changed. I’m not as accommodating or agreeable as I used to be, and I’m realizing a lot of this relationship only worked because I didn’t push back. Now I just feel irritated and drained instead of excited to see him.",0,1766581968.0,Advice,7,0.5,False

I'd never fainted in my life, and I thought I was having a very sudden anxiety/panic attack, just felt nauseous and then panicked and dizzy out of nowhere. But after trying to stand and go to the toilet, I fainted. I recovered quickly and the doctors found nothing wrong with me. 

Then around 11 months later it happened again, at my desk at work. This time I was admittedly not well hydrated and had just had a coffee, and I was having some kind of indigestion or anxiety making my throat feel like it had a lump in it. I was reading about symptoms of acid reflux, and suddenly got that wave of nausea and panic again, and before I knew it I was on the floor. They sent me to a neurologist because I'd been convulsing a bit, but there was nothing wrong with my brain.

And just yesterday, 10 months on from that, it happened again, in a restaurant sitting down. Two people I was with were talking in depth about atrial fibrillation, and I started feeling a kind of sympathetic flutter in my chest, that turned into panic, turned into light headedness and by the time I was asking them if they could change the subject I was presyncope and fainted right after. 

All three times I was fine after a day of resting, and there was nothing physically wrong with me, and very few incidents of dizziness in between. What's especially confusing is I have a history of anxiety, specifically around feeling/being sick. So when I feel nauseous and anxious that's basically an anxiety attack for me, but it's also the symptom of an oncoming faint. I've been in much more stressful and anxiety inducing situations throughout the past 2 years than those three (times 1 and 3 were in fact very pleasant and peaceful nights out with friends and family).

 I have no idea what's caused these to happen, and worse what might cause them again in future - now it's happened 3 times it feels like it'll be a semi regular but unpredictable thing. Im going to see a cardiologist soon just to rule out a blood problem but I'm not hopeful about them being able to explain this or help me avoid it. My biggest worry is that I won't ever be safe to drive a car, if this could theoretically happen with no warning.

My only leads are the anxiety and possibly the medical symptoms discussion right before the faints. Does anyone have a similar experience or any advice?",3,1766581726.0,Syncope,1,1.0,False

1pumzgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pumzgu/take_a_walk_with_the_moon_man/,Take a walk with the Moon Man,"April struggled to keep herself awake, heavy rings around her eyes making them look sunken and empty. She pulled her knees to her chest, taking in a deep breath, before putting her forehead against the window. Each time her eyes fluttered shut, she would shake herself awake, taking in a sharp breath and sitting back up straight.

​

I did something I probably shouldn't have: I offered the eight-year-old a drink from my cup of coffee. She giggled as I pushed the cup towards her, taking the black liquid, and, thinking it was like water, took a big gulp. She stopped, her face scrunched up in a bitter ball, and placed the cup back onto the windowsill so she could cough into her elbows.

​

“April, I’ll keep watching, okay? Go get some sleep with your mom.” I whispered to her, nodding to the woman snoring lightly on the sofa behind us. They had matching tied-back brown-blonde hair and bags hanging from their brown-blonde eyes.

​

April shook her head no. “You have to watch for the Moon Man.” Then turned back to peer outside into the night.

​

The average person can go about thirty-six hours without sleep before their brain starts to bog down. Seventy-two brings on paranoia and hallucinations. The average person is passed out on the sofa, while her daughter and I sit at the windowsill and wait for her father to come home. Her father and the Moon Man. I’m afraid neither is going to show up tonight, or tomorrow, or ever.

​

April didn’t know, but a week ago today, her father was found in a construction ditch just twenty minutes away from home. He was on the way home from the bar, drinking maybe one or two too many, before falling down and never getting up again. I only prayed he died instantly, maybe hitting his head on a piece of concrete, instead of sitting there in the cold rain.

​

I’m his emergency contact.

​

Why would he do that?

​

Why would he make his best friend be the one to tell his wife that he died?

​

Jenna laughed when I knocked on her door, and I told her he had passed. She told me to tell him to get his shit together and to come home. It wasn’t the first time he needed to stay over at my place. When I didn’t say anything, when my face didn’t change, or when Evan didn’t jump out from behind the door to surprise her, she slapped me. I closed my eyes and let her slap me again. Then again. Then she fell into my arms and silently screamed into my chest. She couldn’t let April know.

​

We’d have to eventually.

​

Just not right now.

​

Time doesn’t feel the same when you lose someone. Your mind tries to hang itself in the past, tries to remember as much of them as you can, afraid that maybe one day you’d forget and they would be gone again. Jenna and I spent a lot of time sitting in that small kitchen apartment, staring at full plates of microwave dinners. We said nothing for hours at a time, making ourselves ready for when April came home. Then it would be only smiles, and jokes, tasty frozen pizzas, and soda for dinner, and Uncle Jerry would be reading her favorite bedtime story to her again.

​

A story about a small child who became lost in the big city, finding his way home with the help of a tall, friendly man, dressed in a three-piece suit, with a moon for his head. It ended with,

​

“When you can’t find your way at night, and the sky doesn’t shine as bright,

​

When you’re not sure if you could or can, take a walk with the Moon Man.”

​

The warm glow of the moon lifted straight off the pages and into April as she cuddled on my arm and fell asleep.

​​

Two days ago, Jenna was working night, and I was sleeping on the sofa. I felt a tug on my foot before someone shone an intense, bright light into my face, making me cover my eyes and shoot up, awake. When I opened them, April was sitting beside me, tugging on my arm. I asked her what was wrong, and she just disappointedly said that I didn’t wake fast enough, and then went back to bed all on her own. She hasn’t slept a single night since then, and she hasn’t let me sleep either.

​

We sat together each night, like tonight, at the window, and waited for the Moon Man.

​

I kept my eyes out the window, looking down onto the street from the two-story window. My ears strained themselves to focus on the only other noise in the apartment, the low hum of the fridge. It was three in the morning. Not a single car drove by, not a single person walked the street. Not even the moon was out; the streets beneath us were only lit up by hazy yellow lamps. Suddenly, I heard something else. In sync with her mother, April lightly started to snore. Her head was pressed against the window, her nose fogging up the glass with each breath.

​

Gently, I leaned her into my shoulder, wrapping a blanket around her small, tired frame. My eyes began to drift too, my chest squeezing with exhaustion. At that moment, I thought I had fallen asleep, the sunrise already trying to pry my eyes back open. When it succeeded, my eyes opened again to the dark city streets.

​

It looked like, somehow, a circle of reality was cut out of the middle of the street. A bright emptiness sat on the dotted yellow lines, turning slightly, beaming an intense bright light across the ground as it did. No shadows, no sense of shape, just a blank, deafening white.

​

Then it started to stand up.

​

Long limbs drawn together like scribbles of crayon, lifting its head higher and higher into the sky until it stood level with the buildings. Its legs sank into the dark of the ground, its arms hung loosely at its side, and its fingers scratched against the pavement. It began to walk away from me before turning back, shining one more time in my direction.

​

I wanted to shake April awake, to show her that he was there, that he was real. But she knew that he was real. She knew he was there, and that he had to go. His bright void looked at me, not her.  I nodded slightly to him, holding April tighter in my arms. He nodded back, then walked off into the night.

Hello. I have a dilemma, whether to officially report the following offences to the police for them to consider prosecution, and wondered if anyone could help with possible scenarios if I do contact the police, I'm scared/worried. (I know this varies case by case - I want to work out that I have a genuine issue, that I'm not overreacting etc, and I'm scared of repercussions. The carer was investigated for gross misconduct but resigned before they put all the strong evidence against her. It would have led to dismissal due to gross misconduct. 
____________________

A person in position of trust, carer in the home looking after vulnerable client and the following events occurred. 
(brief overview, happy to give more clarity if needed).

1) sees videos on clients mobile phone; carer saw, copied, forwarded to herself (WhatsApp) and shared with other SCD classification videos (Special Category Data, Risk) without consent from or knowledge of the client. Verifiable evidence. 

2) Financial abuse: client was unaware of this until investigation by company commenced. Verifiable evidence uncovered by company. 

3) Fraud by misrepresentation: falsifying record logs saying she had carried out tasks she had not done, thereby claiming wages for work not done. Verifiable evidence. 

4) Failing safeguarding duties (said checked client in bed, checked blood sugars, brought meds, water, coffee to sleeping client - didn't happen) she didn't acknowledge she was in the house for over 1 hour before checking on ill client (verifiable evidence) so also misrepresentation, claiming financial reward for work not done and falsification of records. 

Any advice or suggestions would be gratefully received. This has had a terrible backlash in my mental health, can't sleep properly, fearing 'retaliation', don't feel safe at home (spent £100s on security cameras etc), don't want ANY carers due to loss of trust and confidence but sadly I do need them.

This is about the legal aspects, not about employment aspects. Something is being added to her DBS, unsure what it's called, sorry. ",2,1766581505.0,LegalAdviceUK,1,1.0,False

I woke up early, looked out the window, saw that it was bright and sunny outside and decided it was the best weather to close the curtains again and dig into my backlog and ignore the christmas spirit as best as i can.

Made a cup of coffee, booted up my pc and set down in my Chair. Looking at my steam library i decided to play a bit of Hogwarts Legacy which i bought during the christmas sale. 

So I hit play and the game boots up and.... black screen, monitor light is turning orange. strange!? Hit ctrl, alt, delete. nothing happens. 

Okay, freak crash no biggie. Reset PC. Boots up fine, get into desktop, start steam, select Hogwarts Legacy and hit play. 
The game boots and get to the title screen, hit start and am greeted with character creation. I move the mouse an inch and... black screen again, monitor light is orange again. Shit! Is the game broken? Reset PC again, boot into desktop and start steam. This time i decide to start Cyberpunk, it ran fine a couple of days ago. Boot the game and it crashes at the second splash screen. 

Now i get worried and shut down my PC, open the side panel and try to pull off the power cable from my gpu. Its kind of hard to pull off. Maybe its sits in the slot really tight? I pull harder and it finally comes off, i look at it and am greeted with this [sight](https://imgur.com/zUdaJTb). This is how the [connector on the card](https://imgur.com/Lub8BJm) looks like Feels bad man.
The 5090 i bought in late July decided to commit sepukku and fried its power connector. 2.600€ and not even half a year later this shit happens. The funny thing is, I undervolted the card from the start. Monitored the power draw while gaming with RTSS and MSI afterburner and gamed at 1440p despite having a 4K OLED just to keep the card at around 250 - 300W power draw until my wireview arrives. 

I guess it could have been worse from what i have seen on the internet but now i most likely have to wait until new year until i can file a RMA claim and hope that MSI does not try to put the fault on my or the PSU manufacturer. This sucks!! 
Right now I am debating if i should just switch cables and still use the card because the cards connector doesnt look that bad but i am afraid that will further damage the card and void my chances of getting it repaired under warranty.
Sorry for the long post, i just needed to vent my frustration and say Fuck Nvidia for not aknowledging that this connector is absolute hot garbage and fuck the card manufactures for not including per pin monitoriing on their cards just to save a couple of bucks on an absolutely premium prized product!!!

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

1pumvhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1pumvhp/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_sister_regain/,AITA for refusing to help my sister regain custody after she told my kids I molested her out of jealousy and CPS determined she's a risk to children?,"My sister told my kids I sexually abused her when we were children and now CPS has banned her from seeing her own daughters.

She showed up at my house three weeks ago while I was at work. My daughter Emma (16) and son Jake (14) were home alone. She sat them down at our kitchen table and told them their mother molested her repeatedly from ages 8-12. Said she kept quiet all these years to ""protect the family"" but they ""deserved to know the truth about who raised them.""

Emma called me hysterical. I could barely understand her through the sobbing. ""Mom, Aunt Sarah said you hurt her. She said you touched her. She said she has proof.""

I left work immediately. Drove home doing 80 in a 55. When I got there my sister was still in my kitchen drinking my coffee like she hadn't just detonated my entire life. My kids were upstairs, doors locked, wouldn't come out.

""What the fuck did you tell them?"" I stood in the doorway, keys still in my hand.

She looked at me with this calm expression. ""The truth. They're old enough to know what kind of person their mother really is.""

""I never touched you. Not once. You know that's a lie.""

""Do I?"" She set down the mug. ""Funny how you remember it differently than I do.""

I called the police right there. Told them someone was in my home making false allegations and refusing to leave. My sister laughed, actually laughed, and said ""Go ahead, call them. Let's see who they believe.""

The cop who showed up knew us both from high school. He asked her to leave. She went, but not before yelling loud enough for my kids to hear, ""I have therapy records. I have journals. They'll believe me.""

My kids wouldn't talk to me for four days. They stayed at my mom's house. Emma blocked my number. Jake would only communicate through my mom. He asked her if the allegations were true. My own son asked if I was a child molester.

I hired a lawyer immediately. Cost me $5,000 just for the retainer. He advised me to request a psychological evaluation for the whole family and to document everything. I also insisted my sister submit to a polygraph and provide these ""therapy records"" she claimed to have.

Turns out there were no records. No journals. No proof of any kind. When pressed by her own lawyer, she admitted she'd never told any therapist about abuse. Never filed a police report. Never mentioned it to anyone until three weeks ago.

The family therapist we all had to see together was the one who broke it. Dr. Morrison, an older woman who specialized in family trauma. She met with my sister privately for two hours, then with me, then with both of us together.

In that joint session Dr. Morrison asked my sister to describe specific incidents. Times, places, what I allegedly did. My sister started talking and within five minutes she'd contradicted herself three times. Said I abused her in our shared bedroom when we never shared a bedroom. Said it happened when our parents were at work when our mom was a stay-at-home parent until we were in high school. Said I threatened her if she told anyone when I was barely older than her and spent most of my childhood reading in my room.

Dr. Morrison stopped her. ""Sarah, these details don't align with the timeline you provided earlier. Can you clarify?""

My sister broke down. Started crying, saying she was confused, saying maybe she had the years wrong. Dr. Morrison pushed gently and my sister finally admitted that nothing happened. She made it up. All of it.

""Why?"" I asked. My voice sounded hollow even to myself.

She wouldn't look at me. ""Because you have everything. Perfect kids, perfect job, perfect life. Mom likes you better. She always has. I wanted them to see you're not so perfect.""

She wanted to ruin me out of jealousy. That's it. No abuse, no trauma, no repressed memories. Just jealousy and spite.

Here's where it gets worse. My sister has two daughters of her own, ages 6 and 9. Her ex-husband found out about the false allegations through the family grapevine. He immediately filed for emergency custody and contacted CPS.

CPS investigated. They determined that someone willing to fabricate child sexual abuse allegations poses a risk to children. They didn't take her daughters away completely but she's now only allowed supervised visitation. She has to meet with them at a state facility with a social worker present. Her ex has primary custody and she's banned from their school, their extracurriculars, everything.

She called me sobbing last week. ""You have to tell them it was a misunderstanding. Tell them I was confused. Please, they won't let me see my babies alone.""

I hung up on her.

My kids are back home now. Emma's in therapy. Jake barely speaks. They both look at me differently, like they're not quite sure what they believe even though Dr. Morrison explained everything. That doubt she planted is still there.

My mom thinks I should help my sister get her custody rights back. ""She made a mistake,"" my mom said. ""She's your sister. Family helps family.""

But she didn't make a mistake. She deliberately told my children I was a child molester. She sat in my kitchen and tried to destroy my relationship with my kids for no reason except jealousy. Now she's facing consequences and wants me to save her.

I told my mom I'm never speaking to my sister again. I'm not helping her. I'm not testifying on her behalf. She made her choice and now she gets to live with it.

My mom called me cruel. Said I'm punishing my nieces by refusing to help. But I didn't do this. My sister did this to herself.

Now I'm wondering if I'm being too harsh. AITAH?

1pums1n,https://i.redd.it/k7q9kqj8g59g1.jpeg,Do you ever experience a sense of déjà vu?,"Good morning!  Do you ever experience a sense of déjà vu? When I was hired at a boatyard many decades ago, the very moment I was shown the break area I was struck by the unmistakable feeling I'd been there before. That, of course, was impossible. Prior to that day, I had never set foot in the place.

The room was far too conspicuous to ever be forgotten. The boatyard itself was very old—it's gone now, but it was hundreds of years old at that time —and the break area was tucked into one of the many added-on shops that seemed to telescope outward from the main building. A large woodstove stood off to one side, encircled by a mismatched collection of dilapidated chairs, every one of them rescued from the town dump. Against one wall sat a small counter that served as the “coffee station,” where we made ourselves hot drinks as we thawed out beside the stove during our brief respites from work.

I most often labored alone, so I especially enjoyed these gatherings around the woodstove. We drank our coffee or ate our lunches while the heat crackled and popped from the stove. The conversation was always interesting, often humorous. I listened with rapt attention as the old-timers told stories of their childhoods and early adult lives on Cape Cod—of bootleggers, the Great Depression, and both World Wars. It was like sitting inside a living archive, the past warming the room as surely as the fire did.

Then one day, something clicked. In the middle of a conversation, I suddenly thought, I know what they’re going to say next. And I did. The exchange unfolded exactly as I somehow knew it would. It was then that I realized I had dreamed this very scene years earlier.

I never told anyone. I was afraid people would think I'd gone around the bend. The experience was genuinely bizarre, and I have no explanation for it beyond coincidence—albeit a striking one. Despite having written a book series called The Dreamer, centered on the adventures of a Neanderthal character who questions the meaning of his own dreams, I don’t believe my dreams are in any way special. Still, I’ve had a few that give me pause.

They’re never grand or prophetic. I once dreamed of walking down a flight of concrete steps, which were flanked on both sides by rows of rather anemic-looking plants, to enter a building. Not long afterward, I visited a new dentist for the first time—and walked down those very stairs. It wasn’t the sort of thing that made one stop short and proclaim ah! It was subtler than that. Quieter. Easy to dismiss, yet hard to forget.

There have been other dreams, some more meaningful on a personal level. And one or two I've mentioned here before. And still others— perhaps I’ll write about them another time. In all, it's a mere total of 5 dreams over a period of over six decades that seemed to push beyond the normal realm of night-visions. 

For now, I’m content to file these moments away with the many small, inexplicable mysteries that life occasionally offers—brief flickers of recognition that remind us how little we truly understand, even as we go about our ordinary days.

I hope all is well in your corner of the world! 🌞 ",1,1766581001.0,u_Read_an_ice_age_saga,0,1.0,False

And yet we never saw our audience. We called at house after house; we sang in courtyards and porches, outside windows, or in the damp gloom of hallways; we heard voices from hidden rooms; we smelt rich clothes and strange hot food; we saw maids bearing in dishes or carrying away coffee cups; we received nuts, cakes, figs, preserved ginger, dates, cough-drops and money; but we never once saw our patrons.

Eventually we approached our last house high up on the hill, the place of Joseph the farmer. For him we had chosen a special carol, which was about the other Joseph, so that we always felt that singing it added a spicy cheek to the night.

We grouped ourselves round the farmhouse porch. The sky cleared and broad streams of stars ran down over the valley and away to Wales. On Slad's white slopes, seen through the black sticks of its woods, some red lamps burned in the windows.

Everything was quiet: everywhere there was the faint crackling silence of the winter night. We started singing, and we were all moved by the words and the sudden trueness of our voices. Pure, very clear, and breathless we sang:

'As Joseph was a walking

He heard an angel sing;

'This night shall be the birth-time

Of Christ the Heavenly King.

He neither shall be borned

In Housen nor in hall

Not in a place of paradise

But in an ox's stall .....

And two thousand Christmases became real to us then; The houses, the halls, the places of paradise had all been visited; The stars were bright to guide the Kings through the snow; and across the farmyard we could hear the beasts in their stalls. We were given roast apples and hot mince pies, in our nostrils were spices like myrrh, and in our wooden box, as we headed back for the village, there were golden gifts for all.”

You walk down Mission Street or cut through Golden Gate Park and it feels like smoking is legal pretty much everywhere in the city. But for those of us who actually want to follow the rules, or just want to avoid a ticket, the laws are surprisingly restrictive compared to the culture.

With the new regulations that kicked in recently allowing dispensaries to serve hot food and non-alcoholic drinks, I have been thinking a lot about where we can actually go to consume.

The biggest trap that trips up tourists and even long-time locals is the federal land issue. I think people forget that spots like the Presidio, Ocean Beach, Baker Beach, and Fort Funston are not city parks. They are federal property. Since cannabis is still federally illegal, the park rangers there can write you a real ticket. It is not like a city citation. If you are lighting up at a bonfire on Ocean Beach, you are technically rolling the dice with federal law enforcement.

Then you have the city streets and parks like Dolores. Under California law, public consumption is illegal, basically the same as the open container laws for alcohol. The reality we all see is that SF PD generally has bigger fish to fry. I find that as long as you aren't blowing smoke in people's faces, near a school, or right in front of a building entrance, you are usually fine. It really comes down to just being a respectful neighbor.

This is why I am actually pretty grateful for the lounge scene here. SF is one of the few cities that has legitimate consumption lounges, and they are finally getting better with the new laws that allow for food and drink service. It moves us closer to that Amsterdam style coffee shop vibe. Places like Moe Greens on Market or Barbary Coast in SoMa are great because you can just sit inside, have some table service, and relax without looking over your shoulder.

It feels especially important because so many landlords ban smoking in leases, so a lot of renters don't actually have a legal ""private property"" spot to go to.

I am curious what your habits are. Do you guys actually use the lounges now that they are evolving, or do you just stick to the ""walk and talk"" method on the sidewalk? And for the beach goers, do you worry about the federal rangers or just risk it?",0,1766580627.0,bayarea,10,0.4,False

I take 100 mg prevailing to sleep better every evening. I am drinking 1 cup of coffee a day. I am drinking regularly (weekend, probably 1-2 bottles of wine). I eat tons of mint and peppermint fishermens friend for years because I quit smoking and I still need it (replaced these with 1 MG nicotine drops I took before, around 20 per day, so I think that's hetter). I don't move too much.

I tried tetra band as my left side is somehow ""shorter"" with bands (can't really stretch my left leg, probably sat too many years playing games). after the use of terraband, my twitching on the left became crazy, but calmed down since then to the symptoms below.

  
edit end.

Guys, many of you experience BFS and I probably have it as well. I went to 3 different experts, they excluded anything severe.

While I feel less worried, I still have issues and I don't understand why.

I read that if you jave twitching from time to time it's nothing to worry about. But I have them almost all the time, but only on my left side (mostly leg and arm).

In my hand, it is the muscle next to my small finger pulsing slowly, sometimes the one between thumb and index.

In mu feet, it feels different.

It's there all the time, way faster rate, on my sole.

It might help when I move the feet, but only for like 10 seconds, then there's still that feeling of tension and twitching.

I also have it in my arm, next to my elbow, very often.

As.i mentioned, I dont worry too much, but I can feel it all the time and the fact thay it does never fo away... makes me feel uncomfortable.

Anyone experiencing this for longer than me and still not sick?",2,1766580464.0,BFS,3,1.0,False
1pumln4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pumln4/i_just_need_to_vent/,I just need to vent.,"Morning everyone. I've been married for 32 yrs. We have 2 wonderful kids & a grandchild. They are my life. So my venting starts. I've noticed over many, many years my husband and kids really don't think of me when it comes to my birthday, mother's day or Christmas. I've sat silent on my husband's birthday, fathers day or Christmas time. I've watch our kids really go over board for gifts for him, football jerseys, football tickets, sending time (hours) with him. I've made sure to get everyone together for him for birthday dinners, surprise parties for him. Really thinking about what he would like for Christmas. 
But when it comes for me, I've been handed a 2lt of pop, given cupcakes for mother's Day but then asked later if they could have them back. They will come over and within 15 mins they are going home. Never taken me out for a special dinner. No, surprise parties. 1 year our youngest child needed to borrow my vacuum cleaner, I never got it back. So after a month I decided to go get a new 1. Yes it was right before Christmas. My husband decided that was my gift from him. And I didn't receive anything. Our oldest gave my a coffee cup from the dollar store 1 year. 1 year my husband stopped at bed bath & body beyond on Christmas Eve on our way to a family gathering to pick up a gift. We got home late, I was told it was for his mom. Ok so I even wrapped it. To find it under the tree for me. It was something I never asked for or even use it. 
But my husband & kids can't understand why I don't want to celebrate my birthday, mother's Day or Christmas. I've explained this to my husband in the years. Every year I just feel like I'm being walked all over. 
Thank you for letting me vent. 
Everyone have a great Christmas and wonderful holiday. ",13,1766580390.0,AITAH,17,0.93,False

I had to stop working 11/4/24 to have 3 surgeries. 11/7/24 bi-lateraal carpal tunnel- of which b/c I put surgery off due to finance's I now have nerve damage. 12/10/24 Achille's debredment of the Haglund's deformity takes 1 yr to heal, and then 6/17/2025 Total left knee replacement (5/3/2023 had right total knee, no issue's) that has complication's, everything left of the scar on my knee, is numb, texture of leather, rubbery and also  feel's very heavy. Despite having therapy from 8/5/25-11/10/25, there has been any progression of healing, it's actually worse now the heaviness has me walking with a limp and I just found out that my entire left leg has atrophy, and see a Neurologist, who found that I have cervical (neck) degenerative stenosis with radiculopathy and mild meylopathy, basically nerve root compression and mild spinal cord compression. On Dec 26, 2025 I am having a MRI of my Lumbar they suspect the same is going on in my lower back from a compressed nerve root/ spinal cord compression that is why I am having atrophy in my leg. Dec 31, 2025 I have a Appt with them to make a plan of care and discuss finding's. It's been very tough being off work, my job although grueling, it actually fullfilled me. I had some childhood trauma from the age of 4 by a baby sitter's older son's, saw my Dad abuse my Mother and even though we lived in the same home , I wouldn't speak to him for year's b/c of this. At 12 I would spend my entire summer in the bed and back then they called me the Black sheep, not knowing it would be one of a lifetime of where I go to retreat when that Dark cloud of Depression/ Anxiety and PTSD comes lurking in my life. I swore I would never allow myself to be treated like my Mother, and I met the Love of my Life, the 1st few year's were perfect, then came the psychological abuse, cheating,spitting in my face etc.. the children came we had 2 girl's, he wasn't there for neither, I mean he came around peeping through the window's, pushing the air conditioner in through the window, waiting for me to come home breaking in while I am at work. My parent's helped me and the girl's. I even asked his Mother 1 time if she could get him to help, ""If you had a Better job, you wouldn't care if he worked or not""!!  I said to myself, I would never ever ask her for anything again, and I didn't.  12 yrs ago he came over, the girl's were in High school and when he's drunk he want's to have a family meeting! But it's basically a meeting to tell us everything that we are doing wrong! We were all sitting around the couch, I had a big thick square wooden coffee table, he began to rage as usual and I quietly asked him to leave us alone, he flipped the coffee table so hard that the side of it slammed right into both of my knee cap's, and from that moment on they would give out. That's why my knee's were injured along with working on paper 12hrs but in actuality I was working 14, 16 hr shift's as a nursing assistant, I could barely walk to clock out, let alone get out my car and walk up a flight of stair's to get into my Apt.  I started only living in apartment's that had a upstair's to not make it easy for her to stalk, even though he'd ring the buzzer, he couldn't get in the building or break in.  I worked really until I couldn't work anymore. from 2017- until today I have seen Dr's about foot pain, knee, back, hand's- finger's, neck pain. I put thing's off that they wanted to do surgically I mean I had bill's, I helped put a daughter through college, my other her and her husband were just starting, my Parent's had retired so I couldn't lean on anyone. So I became a workaholic, and I am paying for it now with my body. I have also been in mental trauma therapy for 3 year's now, never dated after Ex, Yuck, it's the last thing on my mind, althoughI get lonesome, I am angry and think that what he did to my knee's I should get a check for the rest of my life. My lease was up 12/31/2024 and I couldn't resign, I had a cast on from the achille's surgery I had on the 10th of Dec My family did come together and help me with a storage locker, and I stayed with my Sister until Public Housing called me 2 day's before my 6/17/2025 Left knee replacement surgery. I was blessed and appreciate my little apartment, was glad not to be homeless.  When I was working on my birthday 9/3 born in 70, I would gift myself usually 3-4 new bra's and 6-8 new underwear. I wear a size 38DDDD or 38 G, and those are ample so it took good bra's to make them sit up nice. I started buying them off Amazon b/c I found they were cheaper. Bali, Wacoal, Lilyette and Vanity Fair control underwear, all I wear was nude colored.  But since I have been off an not working I had to apply for SSDI in Feb 2025 and awaiting a decision, I haven't been able to buy new bra's or underwear.  That's why I am asking if anyone out there has used, mildly damaged bra's sized 38 DDDD or 38 G if they can spare to please donate to me. I am so very embarrassed to ask people for help with such a personal matter. I can provide incomeverification's if needed. Public Housing, SNAP, Medicaid a letter from my therapist.  I have alway's been a giver and often got people, family and friend's to donate to my patient's at the Nursing home I was working at especially my last year of being a aid. The 5 year's before I actually had 3 job's, I worked in a ED at a major hospital, a nursing home and a nursing agency.  I seen alot of home's that were shocked me how patient's were living but instead of me being grossed out, it made me wanna help them and besides I was isolated and withdrawn and my patient's made me feel safe and as if I could be myself and not be judged and that meant the world to me and vice versa, I treated them all how I'd want me or My Mother to be treated.  That's why it's so painful to not be in a position now to help other's and need help myself. Bra's are exspensive and I always bought them b/c growing up I only had like 1, 2 a year and they looked horrible so I said when I get older, I'm not gonna have just 1, I actually had too many, but different bra's look different in different clothing same size just made different. I am sorry to just go on and on with my story about Bra's I am sure that you all have better thing's to do.  I often go to thrift stroes and they never have my size either too big or too small.  So I am askiing if you have any one's that you don't wear to help me out. I love nude but at this point it doesnt even really matter.  I hope that you all do and I promise when I get on my feet to go back to doing the same, helping other's. Ideally I want to get my health in order, it sound's as if I am gonna have surgery on neck/ back and injection's therapy. But if I get my SSDI that I am waiting for a decision, after a year or 2 I want to return to school and get my LPN, to work back with the geriatric community. They need good people out there who actually look out for them and care, and I alway's took pride in that. Again, if you can help it would be forever appreciated. I hope you all have a Happy Holiday season with You and Your Loved One's and Praying for Love, Peace and happiness and uniting Our Country for 2026. Thank you for your time.  Yvonne Simmons.

1pumhu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMec/comments/1pumhu1/besoin_de_conseils_honnête_je_suis_désespérée/,"Besoin de conseils honnête, je suis désespérée","Salut à vous, 

Je suis en quête de conseils de la part d'hommes, surtout pas d'être caresser dans le sens du poil (c'est pourquoi je ne vais demander sur askmeuf). Je ne vais certainement pas être sympathique dans mon approche, et  ça va peut être en froisser certains.

39F ici, j'approche dangereusement de l'âge ""critique"" (pas vraiment ce que je pense mais ca reste un palier psychologique) et je suis célibataire. Je bosse dans le spectacle, intermittent, ce qui fait que mes soirées, week end, sont souvent les moments où je travaille. Ajoutez à ca que j'ai mon appart à Paris mais je vis aussi chez mes parents en province parce que je travaille dans les 2 villes et que je n'ai pas vraiment d'autres choix pour le moment, je dois faire mes heures, et je doit aussi en faire le plus possible pour avoir un taux journalier correct. Et quand je dit correct, ça ne veux pas dire roulez sur l'or et gagner 3-4000€/mois, j'en suis très très très loin. Et non, malheureusement, je ne trouve pour l'instant pas ailleurs, ce qui pourrait me faire lâcher la province (et en plus j'aime bien bosser dans le théâtre où je suis en province, c'est celui où j'ai le plus de responsabilité, où on me fait le plus confiance et aussi où j'aime la programmation). En dehors de mon taf je fait du sport, entre 8 à 10h par semaine de muscu/fitness. Je suis donc assez fit, pas Schwarzie mais fit quand même, je vous voit venir, mais non, je ne fait 8h/semaine de routine bas du corp, déjà parce que j'aime pas et que c'est ma faiblesse, je suis plus haut du corp. Et c'est aussi ce que je cherche à plus renforcé, dû à mon taf qui me demande de porter des trucs lourds parfois dans des positions improbable. Hormis ça j'ai plus des masses de hobbies, a part la photo, voyager et me poser dans des coffee shop hors de prix pour lire (c'est mon côté bobo). Et je fais plus jeune que mon age (en générale on me met 10 ans de moins voir plus) merci la génétique et la skincare coréenne.   
  
Mon problème maintenant, je n'arrive pas à rencontrer ""l'homme"" pour me ""caser"". Et quand je dit ça, c'est que je galère a ne serait ce qu'avoir 1 date avec des hommes. J'ai essayé les appli, c'est un echec cuisant. Et le seul date que j'ai réussi à avoir, on c'est vu 2 fois et depuis le gars me garde accroché dans un coin et met 2 j à répondre au moindre message (il me lache un vu et après ciao pour 2j). Quand je vivais à l'étranger (en Corée je précise), je n'ai jamais galéré, car même si les dates ne menaient à rien, j'avais au moins le date. J'avoue aussi que je sortais plus, je n'avais pas d'appréhension à aller dans un bar seule ou même avec des gens et c'était assez facile de parler avec les gens autour. Je n'ai même pas des tonnes de like ou de messages comme beaucoup le pense au sujet des femmes sur les applis. Alors oui, je ne swipe pas à droite tous le monde. Dans la tranche d'âge que je cherche, les hommes ce sont pour beaucoup énormément laisser aller, ou se ressemble tous, ou on est sur des stéréotypes Lacoste-TN, maitre gims eco+, type de tv réalité. Une fois enlever tous les ""rien de sérieux"" (mention spéciale à ceux qui marque je ne suis pas objet on ne me possède pas), ""non-monogamie éthique"" (jolie nom pour dire polygamie), ""couple qui cherche une troisième personne pour s'amuser"", il reste bien moins de monde. Et quand je match, je tente de parler, d'engager la conversation, soit ça part en un match, soit ça répond pas. J'ai tenté les classiques, les remarque sur le profil, les phrase drôle, les gifs, ... rien ne marche. J'admets que je ne suis pas un stéréotype, je me maquille peu, n'a pas de photos en legging (team bon vieux jogging à la salle, le legging ça colle et ca ne me va pas), ni 100 photos filtrés. A la salle, j'admet que je suis dans ma bulle, et globalement, personne ne m'aborde. Comme dit avant, j'y vais pas en tenue fitgirl influenceuse, j'ai le combo jogging débardeur, je suis là pour transpirer, soulever des trucs, je vais faire des grimaces de l'espace en faisant les exos, donc rien de sexy. a mon boulot, malheureusement c'est le spectacle, c'est soit le stéréotypes des techniciens, soit des gens qui ont le double de mon âge, soit la moitié de mon âge, soit des gays et la minorité qui pourraient me convenir sont soit des gros gros chaud, soit ne me voit que comme la technicienne/régisseur et rien d'autre. 

J'admet que je ne suis pas la plus souriante, je suis assez taciturne. Souvent perdue dans mes pensées. J'ai peur de me faire jeter donc à mon boulot, si un homme me plait, je ne vais pas y aller car j'ai plus aucun de mes moyens. Et je me dit que s'il me jette, je vais devoir encore bosser avec lui pendant x mois en ayant ça sur la conscience et en sachant que les ragots vont aller bon train. Si c'est dans un bar j'ai moins de problème car au fond, je ne reverrais jamais la personne. Mais je vais rarement dans les bars car je n'ai quasi plus d'amis et que bien que j'ai rencontré des gens grace à reddit, je suis plutôt coincé par mon boulot pour les sorties (les gens sortent le soir, et moi je travaille quand les gens s'amusent). Dans mon patelin de province, c'est encore plus mort, ville dortoir, mix de famille et de cassos, le dernier avec qui je parlais sur insta était un vrai cas, j'en m'étendrais pas plus sur le sujet là au grand vent. 

J'ai bien demandé des conseils au quelques amis que j'ai, et poncé reddit mais c'est toujours les mêmes trucs qui reviennent, donc svp épargnez les moi. Le ""t'as qu'a t'inscrire à la salsa/bachata, on y rencontre des gens"", de un je ne roule pas sur l'or et s'inscrire dans un club dans lequel je ne pourrais pas aller les 3/4 du temps, c'est non et de 2, j'en ai absolument rien à carrer de la salsa ou de la bachata. L'escalade va dans la même catégorie, pas le temps sur la longueur, et je vais déjà à la salle, y a un moment où mon corp va me dire stop. Les club d'art ou de photo, j'ai un peu du mal avec les gens qui les fréquentes, j'y suis ""en demat"" mais irl, c'est beaucoup de vieux. Et je n'en peux plus d'entendre les phrases idiotes de ""ca viendras quand tu t'y attendras le moins"", ""il faut que tu ai l'air ouverte"" (ca veut dire quoi avoir l'air ouverte ? Je suis posé dans un coffeeshop avec un ice latte et ma kindle, je suis au max de l'ouverture), ""y a plein de femmes tres heureuse  de leur célibat"" (y a plein de mytho parce que ça fait féministe, et être ok ne veux pas dire ne pas espérer une relation), ""tant que tu t'aimera pas toi même ça ne marcheras pas"" ( plus je me prends des vents, moins j'arrive à m'aimer moi même), ""lower your standard"" (non). 

Ce que je cherche : je marche au feeling. Alors oui, un homme beau. Mais en soit ça veux juste dire que moi je dois le trouver beau. Le dernier de qui j'étais follement amoureuse n'était objectivement pas beau, mais moi encore aujourd'hui je le trouve beau.  Un type qui prennent un peu soin de lui. Qu'on puisse avoir de quoi parler de truc, intellectuel comme bête. Quelqu'un avec qui je puisse m'ennuyer (comme le disait Louis XIII ""ennuyons nous ensemble""). Quelqu'un avec qui m'amuser et surtout me sentir bien. Je m'en fout de son boulot, de son salaire (je suis assez grande pour me payer des trucs), de sa voiture.... Mais quand même plutôt mourrir que de juste prendre le premier venu qui ne me plait pas, juste par désespoir. Je ne veux pas me lever tous les matin et me retrouver nu devant lui en me disant ""quelle horreur, il va me toucher, je suis dégoutée"". 

Bref, je peux faire quoi à part me resigner et me dire que c'est mort, que je vais juste finir ma vie seule parce que je ne suis pas aimable. Qu'est ce que je peux faire ?

1pumhpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buildingmyfutureself/comments/1pumhpo/the_psychology_of_why_too_busy_is_destroying_your/,"The Psychology of Why ""Too Busy"" Is Destroying Your Health: Science-Based Fitness That Actually Works","I've spent the past year diving deep into fitness psychology, reading everything from Andrew Huberman's neuroscience research to James Clear's behavioral studies, listening to podcasts from Peter Attia and Mark Rippetoe, watching countless YouTube breakdowns. The thing that struck me most? The fitness industry has completely screwed us over. They've convinced everyone that results require 2 hour gym sessions, meal prep Sundays, and some quasi-religious devotion to ""the grind."" Complete BS.



Here's what actually happens. You skip workouts because you genuinely are busy. Your biology fights you because cortisol from chronic stress literally blocks muscle growth and fat loss. Society glorifies hustle culture while your body deteriorates. Then you feel like shit, which makes everything harder, which makes you skip more workouts. It's a brutal cycle, but it's manageable once you understand what's actually happening under the hood.



The 20 minute rule destroys every excuse. Research from Martin Gibala at McMaster University proved that high intensity interval training for just 10-20 minutes produces nearly identical cardiovascular benefits to 50 minutes of moderate cardio. Your body doesn't care about duration, it cares about stimulus. Three 20 minute sessions per week will literally transform your health markers. Blood pressure drops, insulin sensitivity improves, testosterone increases, inflammation decreases. But nobody sells that because there's no money in ""you only need 60 minutes a week."" 



Start stupidly small. Like embarrassingly small. Five pushups before your morning coffee. That's it. Your brain needs proof that you can follow through before it trusts bigger commitments. This concept comes from BJ Fogg's behavioral research at Stanford, detailed in his book Tiny Habits. He's worked with thousands of people and found that massive motivation is unreliable, but tiny consistent actions rewire your identity. You're not trying to become a gym bro, you're collecting evidence that you're someone who moves their body. 



Sleep is the actual cheat code everyone ignores. Matthew Walker's book Why We Sleep is legitimately one of the most important health books ever written. The guy runs the Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab at UC Berkeley and his research shows that even one night of bad sleep (less than 6 hours) reduces testosterone by 10-15% and increases cortisol significantly. You can't out-train bad sleep. You'll spin your wheels in the gym, feel like garbage, probably get injured. Fix your sleep before you even think about complicated workout programs. Download an app like Rise that tracks your sleep debt and circadian rhythm. Game changer for understanding when you actually have energy versus when you're running on fumes.



The biggest trap is thinking you need to ""feel motivated"" first. Motivation is a myth sold by Instagram fitness influencers who monetize your insecurity. Action creates motivation, not the other way around. This is basic behavioral psychology. You do the thing, you feel slightly better, that feeling makes the next rep easier. Cal Newport talks about this extensively in his work on deep habits, the idea that your brain follows behavior, not the reverse.



Progressive overload is the only principle that matters. Everything else is noise. You need to gradually increase the demand on your body. That could mean one extra rep, five more pounds, 30 seconds less rest. Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength lays this out perfectly for beginners. The book is dense but it's basically the bible of ""stop overthinking and just add weight to the bar each session."" You don't need 47 different exercises or some revolutionary Bulgarian split squat variation. You need to consistently do slightly more than last time. That's literally it.



Track your workouts in an app like Strong or Hevy. Sounds basic but seeing your numbers climb week over week creates a psychological hook. You're not just ""going to the gym,"" you're watching concrete proof of improvement. Numbers don't lie. When motivation tanks, which it will, you'll have data showing you're objectively stronger than you were last month. That's powerful.



Here's the part nobody wants to hear. Your diet matters way more than your workout program. Not in some restrictive ""eat chicken and broccoli"" way, but you cannot out-exercise a trash diet. Dr. Layne Norton, who has a PhD in nutritional sciences, constantly emphasizes that energy balance is king. If you're eating 3500 calories of ""healthy"" food but only burning 2500, you will gain fat. Period. Physics doesn't care about your organic quinoa. Use an app like MacroFactor for a few weeks just to understand what you're actually consuming. Most people are shockingly off in their estimates. You don't need to track forever, but the education is invaluable.



BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from high-quality sources like research papers, books, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans based on your specific goals. Built by Columbia University alumni and AI experts from Google, it transforms knowledge into custom podcasts you can actually use. 



Want to understand nutrition science or build better habits? Type what you want to learn, and it generates episodes tailored to your depth preference, from quick 10-minute overviews to detailed 40-minute deep dives with examples. The adaptive learning plan evolves as you interact with it, so the content stays relevant to where you actually are in your journey.



The voice options are legitimately addictive. You can pick anything from a smooth, conversational tone to something more energetic when you need motivation during a workout. It's designed for people learning during commutes or at the gym, so the audio quality and pacing actually work for real life, not just sitting at a desk.



The real secret? Fitness isn't actually about fitness. It's about building a version of yourself who keeps promises to yourself. Every workout you complete is proof that you can be trusted. That confidence bleeds into every other area. You start keeping other commitments. You negotiate better at work because you genuinely feel more capable. Your relationships improve because you're not constantly self-loathing. This compounds faster than you'd believe.

My girlfriend’s hair is really short and curly because she is African-American. About a week ago she got caught messaging other men, and I told her I wanted to end our relationship. During this time she was pulling her hair out and tried to put it in my mouth and put it all over me while I was sleeping. Well, she thought I was sleeping. I was not that’s how I know she was putting hair on me so I got up and went to the couch. Fast-forward a week I’m drinking coffee now mind you I made a cup of coffee from my Keurig machine, I finished the cup and was going to make another. I looked at my coffee mug no issues. As I was getting up my gf asked if she could get me some coffee, she took the coffee cup off the table and refilled it and left for work. Once refilled, I finished the second cup of coffee and noticed two clumps of hair were in the coffee mug. 

I texted and asked why she put hair in my coffee. She stated she did not but when we were fighting, she had placed hair in the ice tray when she was making ice therefore, we have multiple ice cubes with her hair in it. 

I told her that I don’t trust her and that I was extremely nauseated, disappointed, and outraged all at the same time that she would do this to me.  So am I overreacting?",181,1766579962.0,AmIOverreacting,431,0.68,False

since posting i found out that my bm, lottie, was actually fired, probably because of past hr issues (i heard this secondhand off of another coworker). since she left, natalie has been so much easier to work with. i think her and my bm had a bit of a power struggle: natalie because she was sm (duh) against lottie because lottie kinda saw the store as hers to run because natalie is sm of two stores and calls the other store ""her baby"". i was pretty upset lottie was gone because i loved working with her and we became friends but honestly, the more i hear about her from her past working with other people, it's crazy they kept her employed for as long as they did. i won't write all of what she did but she was particularly mean to people she saw as a threat like natalie, and two other coworkers of mine, ""chris"" and ""mack"". mack quit because of lottie before i joined and was just asked to come back by natalie and is so pleasant to work with. chris stayed because she needed the job but was reported to be by lottie soooo many times over the last year that she was wondering if it was worth it. basically, lottie seemed like the issue all along.

yesterday i went into work and had the best shift ive had ever i think. it was me, natalie and mack at first and then natalie was taken over by chris and then another coworker ""lacey"" showed up. me, mack, chris, and lacey had a blast. had so much banter and fun, all while having great interactions with the customers and maintaining great teamwork and a clean store. things just felt so smooth and like we entered flow state. i was actually upset to leave when me and chris' shifts were over. we talked outside and she agreed with me that it was the best shift we've had in a long time, and it's probably because lottie is gone. we both said that lottie is a nice person, just bad as a coworker, which is a shame. i still like lottie, but i don't think i'd want to work with her again, which wouldn't happen because she left the entire company. 

i don't want to jinx it, but i think im going into the new year with a great work environment and a team that's behind each other all the way. only issue we have is a new shift runner who has no idea what she's doing and doesn't want to try and learn 😵‍💫 but that's a future us problem. we're all just so happy we've got a great team overall.

1pumd8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1pumd8d/confused_about_sil/,Confused about SIL,"Hi all! Sorry for the very long post but I literally feel so crazy now. 

(32 F) Been married 4 years. Lived abroad the first 2.5 years, no kids yet. 
I live with my in laws, customary where I’m from, and everyone got along really well especially in the beginning but things have taken a turn, especially with BIL’s wife. 

I could write an entire post about her, but the gist is: double standards, sees boundaries as an attack, constant unsolicited advice and snarky comments, victim-mentality, etc. 
A month ago she yelled at me from the top of her lungs just because she crossed MY boundary (ie moving my stuff without permission) for the THIRD time, and claimed it was by mistake (she told someone to take my stuff to another place), and victimized herself. 
Anyway, she still hasn’t apologized and we don’t talk. Honestly I’m more at peace now bc I don’t have to interact with her anymore. 

However, I do have concerns about my SIL, who is her friend and is close to her I’d say. 
We used to be close-ish; we’d grab coffee together, have dinners outside, etc. though slowly but surely I’ve noticed a change in her attitude towards me and now I feel like her personal doormat and a last thought. 
I think maybe the trigger was when my BIL made a really inappropriate comment about me not being pregnant. I told him it’s none of his business and he said it is, which caused me to literally have a meltdown in front of BIL & SIL (NOTE; my husband was not home in both these instances) 
SIL told my husband I know the other one is crazy but I didn’t expect your wife to be the same too, that was after I apologized to her by text for my meltdown and said it wasn’t like me at all (I never had a meltdown after that). That was a year ago. 
Since then I feel like she barely makes conversation with me. One time I sat with her & BIL and was like “I heard vitamin k was good for the baby’s teeth in utero” and she scoffed and looked her brother and said “then you take vitamin k,”, and it was so condescending the way she said it. 
Then there ws an expo I was in charge of designing a booth for, and I talked about how exhausted, excited but nervous I was and she was like “you’re making us sick with how much you’re talking about it, enough” in a joking way but I was shocked. Her parents didn’t tell her off. I laughed it off but it hurt. She didn’t even come to the expo, but did apologize for not attending despite it being 5 days long, 12 hours each day. 
Then I don’t know why the conversation was about “lavender marriages” lol and she was like “oh like you and my brother?” and she laughed. I laughed and nudged her but didn’t yhink much of it. I was brushing so much under the rug at this point.
This year there’s a noticeable change. I came back from a trip, she didn’t ask me how it was. Barely any conversation and it felt like a one-sided relationship. I texted asking if she wanted to grab dinner which she ignored (she later claimed she didn’t see it bc she was so busy).
She asked my husband over a month ago if I was upset with her (I barely ran into her since we both were out of the house at different times)
Later I asked her if she was upset with me and she said no. She thought I was and I said no and to let me know if I did anything to bother her and I’m really easy to talk to. She said you too.
A few weeks ago I sent an invite to the expo to our group, and I got no replies; no good lucks, no reactions, nothing. 
She didn’t show up, she didn’t ask me about it even when I came home from it. 
It was disappointing. We’re supposed to be like sisters and I receive more support from friends. 
I even mentioned getting into a car accident in front of her and she didn’t say anything. 
Yesterday it was me, her, my husband, and her parents in the living room. She exclaimed to my husband “ugh i want to spring clean your closet and buy you clothes from my own money” 
I didn’t say anything. 
My husband was like “why?”
And she literally said “your clothes suck”.
She knows I shop for my husband and help him with his clothing; I got pissed and left the room. I told my husband it’s disrespectful of her to say that while I’m there. 
Now she traveled and didn’t bother telling me or my husband. 
I can’t help but wonder if BIL’s wife influenced her view on me in any way, because again, I was nothing but nice if not TOO nice with her. There are other instances but I won’t bother mentioning them. 
So, Reddit, if anyone read this anyway, how do I approach her? What’s the verdict?

Option 1: Big 4 Audit

	•	~20k higher total compensation in year 1
	•	Pay remains higher after rotation, though the gap narrows
	•	Long-term goal would be to move into a front-office or more finance-focused role

From coffee chats and what I’ve seen, transferring from audit to consulting seems relatively common, while moving from a bank CPA rotation to front office feels much more competitive and uncertain.

Compensation matters a lot to me, but I ultimately want to work closer to finance in the long run. Big 4 audit feels like better structured training, but the pay difference is hard to ignore.",1,1766579258.0,Accounting,2,0.67,False

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

Three parties in the space of a few days is a lot to prepare for, as well as a house full of guests staying for indefinite periods is enough to give anyone the vapours.  All just before Christmas Day too!

Of course, the people shooing her to bed, probably with the exception of aunt Chantelle doing her motherly bit, are all the workers who know that they get on and achieve far more without the mistress faffing about around the place, and pushing the camera into every action.  They know that she will appear, all apologies and amazement, but at least for shorter periods and the float away again back to her bed.   
Back to her bed... that is until it's time to get up, bathe, buff up the face, puff up the hair, and dress in something slinky with matching high heels, and become lady bountiful again.

Philip meanwhile, wearing a Christmas jumper that either belonged to his grandmother or he picked up at a charity shop...oops  it may well have been knitted and gifted by a loving supporter... is running around doing looking busy changing batteries and doing things that should have been done days before when preparing for guests.  

Marie and Maria, again 'neither fowl nor chicken'  prepping food to feed the hoards and yet are supposed to magically appear dressed up to the nines as guests too.  It's good that those two work well together.  Maria's honesty about the reality and influence of Instagram posts was refreshing and amusing.  As for what Marie did to the Christmas cake...hmm the jury is out on this one.  I don't think I have ever seen a rich fruit cake given the butter cream treatment!

As for the motley crew of guests, I wonder how many of them are there for Christmas.    
Vivienne is there with Isabella, so will Simon be joining them, or will they go back to Chateau Love for Christmas?    
Steve (who I thought was in Canada) and Sara (please someone take her aside and give her some tips on how to dress better), relishing in being part of the 'in crowd' for the night.    
The American 'girls' who I thought from recent reading somewhere had an issue with Stephanie because of problems with their chateau.  
Michael Petherick, never one to pass up a party invitation, there with his latest 'chauffer' Andrew. I can't make up my mind if they are a 'thing' at the moment, or if MP is just using Andrew for all his worth.  
Dana. who as she ages the hemline goes up higher.  She seems to be taking dressing tips from Philip.  It amused me that she proudly presented her 'home cured' salmon, having already seen that Marie had prepared salmon for the feast.  
Michael Potts, always dependable for baking a few loaves of bread, it must give him a sense of purpose whilst at LaLande.  Is he still with Ruth the author? I know she always wanted to be invisible, but she is never mentioned these days.  
Chris, the recipient of a last minute invite - which was kind - but not told the dress code - which was thoughtless.  
All the other full time and temporary inmates of Lalande - family and friends gathered - most happy for their screen time.  
I'm surprised they had enough beds for everyone!  
  
As for the Aussies - they came without explanation, and left without explanation too. Maybe they were only there for Pavlina's birthday bash.

To be fair to Stephanie, she does always compliment her guests.  It can be cringeworthy for us as viewers, but most of the recipients relish having something about them praised.   I think we all bloom if we are complimented about something, but unfortunately when Stephanie is complimenting everyone every time they bump into each other, it does sound somewhat insincere.

Soap - Captain Nemo Tambaku.   
Brush - Rubab men.  
Blade - Wilkinson Sword.  
ASL -  Captain Nemo Pirate Potion. 

Used coconut oil as pre shave. Ditched the spoon and used a dedicated guitar pick to scoop the soap. -2 functionality but +10 coolness. Shave went very well. I finally found my favorite blade and that is wilkinson. 2 nd 3rd use are the sweetspot for me. 

Now coming to the important topic. This is my first sotd after buying this captain nemo products. To be honest I was so dissapointed on my first use, smell was not strong and I don't even like the smell. And the ASL consitency was oily. 
But but after my 3rd Or 4th use, I came to understand and appreciate them both. It's like black coffee and beer. We need to use it more than a couple of time to truely understand it. 

The subtle tobacco fragrance is the best part of the soap and the ASL is not that oily after giving it a good shake before using, it's actually moisturizing. Both gives a good masculine vibe. I am kind of addicted to the ASL and using it daily even on my non shaving days. 

This is my first time buying bayrum product. In some previous post our brothers who used pirate potion said it is not 100% bayrum frag. But I like this frag very much. 

Both the soap and ASL are satisfactory. Thank you abir bhai. Also kindly give ur suggestion on soaps and ASL for my next purchase (based on fragrance of the products) ",6,1766578667.0,Wetshavers_India,8,0.88,False
