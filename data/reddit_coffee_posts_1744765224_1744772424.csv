1k0acij,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyLedWeaning/comments/1k0acij/how_to_counter_snacks_and_smoothie_pouch/,How to counter snacks and smoothie pouch preference?,"**TL;DR:**  
11-month-old won’t eat much during meals but is still clearly hungry. He’ll only eat until full if offered a smoothie pouch or snack at the end. Not sure how to reset his eating habits without letting him go hungry.

-

My almost-one-year-old has been sick or teething for months. Solids, and even milk some days, can be a struggle. 

Letting him self-feed off the coffee table worked much better than the highchair on the days he was having an especially bad time, but then getting him to eat in the highchair became a battle. So now we’re trying to stick to meals in the highchair again to get in a better habit there.

When sick, he became obsessed with smoothie pouches and refuses other food if he sees one. He hoovers them up directly from the pouch. So we try limit them to the last meal if he has not eaten much the rest of the day. 

He barely eats veggies, only wants milk at bed / nap time, loves fruit, and has a sweet tooth. He loves crunchy snacks too, especially these little cheese crackers I make, but since hes not eating at meals I try limit to the stroller. Meal times, I have a whole variety of textures, new and favorite foods..but he often ends meals still hungry and refusing anything but blueberries, puffs, crackers or a fruit smoothie pouch. 

Not sure how to reset without him going hungry or waking up at night from hunger. Open to advice.",1,1744772249.0,BabyLedWeaning,0,1.0,False
1k0abv4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0abv4,4 days in NYC,"Reposting as the photos didn't load properly - hopefully they work this time.

A HUGE thank you to this sub for helping me pick out food stops on my recent trip (arguably the most important part of the itinerary). We ate at 30 places over 4 days, but barely scratched the surface of everything NYC has to offer. 

Just wanted to share some of my favourites:  
1. Nightingale latte at Bird + Branch (Hell's Kitchen): 10/10 earl grey flavour and lovely neighbourhood coffeeshop feel. We stayed just a block away, but I would've never known to come here otherwise.  
2. Mushroom croissant and earl grey morning bun at Radio Bakery (Greenpoint): I would fly back solely for that mushroom croissant, it was incredible. We went on Friday morning and the line actually moved pretty quickly.  
3. Carrot cake at Hani's Bakery (East Village): Winner for my favourite sweet item of the trip. I'll have to go back for the malted cinnamon bun.   
4. Burrata and tartufo slices at L'industrie (West Village): Deserves all the hype and then some; phenomenal pizza. Honourable mention to nearby Mama's Too for their great square vodka slice.  
5. Everything bagel with cream cheese at Apollo Bagels (East Village): I know this isn't traditional but I loved the crunch and airiness of the sourdough. It was my favourite of all the bagels we tried, although definitely on the pricier side.   
6. Malaysian style Milo french toast at Kopitiam (LES): So nostalgic, flavours were on point! We were doing a Chinatown food crawl so didn't have room to order much else here, but I'd love to go back and try some of their mains.  
7. Happy hour at Sake no Hana (LES): One of the prettiest spaces I've been to, and the food held its own. Drinks were great (the popping boba was fun), and all the small bites were perfectly seasoned. For $20 I honestly thought this was a steal.   
8. Jiucai pancake and chocolate bolo bao at Win Son Bakery (East Village): Again, the hype didn't disappoint. This was also surprisingly filling; I shared it with my friend and it was enough for both of us.  
9. Lattes and pastries at Remi43 Flowers & Coffee (Midtown East): Beautiful space, love the concept. My lavender latte and matcha pound cake were top-tier. This was our last breakfast in NYC and I think we ended on a high note.

The only miss for us was Misi (Williamsburg): ordered the occhi and tortelli; both felt quite one-note. We sat at the kitchen counter and it was fun to watch the chefs at work, but I wasn't blown away by the food or the service. I'd likely try Torrisi or Don Angie next time for that \~fancy Italian restaurant in NYC\~ experience, but would love to hear any other suggestions. 

Overall, fell in love with the East Village and would happily spend a month eating my way around there. I'll definitely be back for more, hopefully soon. Thank you once again r/FoodNYC!",4,1744772191.0,FoodNYC,0,1.0,False

Just sharing what I've been doing and finding success with for those also getting started. 

1. Track your ""caloric budget"" and macros. I use My fitness Pal, but I know many here like Carb Manager

2. Walk. A lot. Track your steps too. If you're able to - lift weights too. I lift for 30 - 40 minutes 3 - 4x/week and strive for at least 10k Steps per day. 

3. Hydrate often - especially in the beginning.  And get your electrolytes. I user Keto Vitals from Amazon. 

4. Do what works for you,  but is still keto. I found success eating the same thing for Breakfast, lunch, and snacks during the work week.

For breakfast: 

1 carb balance tortilla
2 tbsp shredded cheese
2 pork sausage links
Sriracha
Coffee

For lunch I do shake that tastes like a Mickey D shamrock shake:
1 scoop isopure vanilla whey protein
1 scoop Keto Chow mint chocolate flavor (keto chow is awesome, but expensive)
1 tsp potassium citrate
1/4 cup heavy cream
1 cup unsweetened vanilla flavored almond milk
1 cup water
Shake & refrigerate over night. 

Snacks:
Flavored almonds
Macadamia nuts (in moderation)
Chomp beef sticks
Cheese sticks
Avocado cups

5. Don't be disheartened when the scale goes up. It'll happen at some point, just stick with it. 

6. Don't forget to continue trimming down your calories as you lose weight. 

7. If you're like me and have a partner who is NOT doing keto - find meals that have a fairly low carb and lower fat core typically made up of vegetables (sheet pan veggies, skillet dishes, salad, etc) and then each cook and add your own protein, sauces, and garnishes (for me beef & cheese; for her chickpeas and herbs) 

8. Stay accountable, even on the weekends. Even when imbibing. If you drink, stick to liquors and zero calorie mixers, but do this in moderation as well. Just because whiskey doesn't have carbs doesn't mean it doesn't have calories. 

9. Don't forget fiber & vitamins. Verrrrrryyyy important. Everybody poops, but pooping better is always better. Psyllium husk powder is a great option. Beyonder fiber I take a multivitamin tablet & krill oil tablet to help with heart health while investing so much fat, sodium, and cholesterol. 

10. Lastly, don't cheat (this applies to more than just keto). All it takes is a just a few too many net carbs to bring back all the water weight, the cravings, and the headaches. Stick with it. Hold yourself accountable for your own health and happiness. You got this. ",1,1744772068.0,ketobeginners,1,1.0,False

## What is Canada Crypto Fund?

**Canada Crypto Fund** is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users—especially beginners—trade cryptocurrencies with minimal manual effort. It uses AI-driven algorithms to monitor crypto markets in real-time, execute trades based on market conditions, and (hopefully) generate profits for users.

It’s similar to platforms like **Bitcoin Code**, **Immediate Edge**, or **Bitcoin Era**, but this one is tailored more specifically for Canadian traders, although it works globally. You don’t need to be a tech genius or a Wall Street pro to use it. The platform does most of the heavy lifting.

Whether you're brand new to crypto or already dabbling in trading, Canada Crypto Fund offers a streamlined way to get involved without having to read charts 24/7 or understand candlestick patterns.

## Who Created Canada Crypto Fund?

The creators of **Canada Crypto Fund** remain pretty low-key, which is kinda typical for platforms in this space. It’s likely developed by a group of fintech developers and crypto enthusiasts who’ve worked on similar automated trading systems before. While it’s not backed by a big-name company or celebrity (despite some sketchy ads that might say otherwise), it does partner with **regulated brokers**, which adds a layer of legitimacy.

I did a bit of digging, and the setup looks nearly identical to other platforms like **Bitcoin Era**—so it’s probably part of a white-label software suite used across different markets. That’s not a bad thing; it just means the tech has been tested before in other regions.

## How Does Canada Crypto Fund Work?

Canada Crypto Fund uses a combination of **machine learning algorithms**, **real-time market scanning**, and **automated trade execution**. Basically, it tries to buy low and sell high—over and over again—based on data it pulls from the crypto market.

Here’s how it works in plain terms:

- You create an account and deposit funds (minimum of $250).
- The platform’s algorithm starts analyzing market trends.
- When it finds what it believes is a profitable opportunity, it places a trade.
- Trades are executed automatically through a broker.
- You can either let it run on autopilot or tweak settings for more control.

This setup is great for those who don’t want to be glued to their screens all day but still want to dip their toes into crypto trading.

## Canada Crypto Fund Pros and Cons

Like any tool, **Canada Crypto Fund** has its highs and lows. Here's my honest take:

**Pros:**

**Cons:**

- **Minimum deposit of $250** – Not huge, but still a barrier for some.
- **Risk of loss** – Like with all trading, profits aren’t guaranteed.

If you're cautious and only invest what you can afford to lose, the pros definitely outweigh the cons.

1k0a99p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k0a99p/update_aita_for_refusing_to_repay_my_ex_husband/,Update: AITA for refusing to repay my ex husband for the college tuition he paid years ago?,"So first I want to clarify some things. Yes it was OUR marital home, we bought it after getting married. I didn’t fight so hard for it in the divorce for a few reasons, mostly that she was borderline harassing me about how they needed the house for their “growing family”. I also didn’t want to deal with a longer and more drawn out divorce and it would’ve been if I fought for the house. Yes he bought me out of the house however it really wasn’t much as it was late 2007. Most of it went towards credit card debt anyway. Another thing, when he was paying for my schooling we were still legally married. The divorce didn’t finalize until after i graduated. There was no child support until after I graduated. There was never any alimony. I did live in the house while I was in school and they lived in an apartment. He paid all those bills including hers after she got pregnant. So his finances were tight at the time. The “family” that called weren’t MY relatives. They were my ex’s and his wives relatives. I thought they were family, they’ve since been blocked. 

Onto the update. I got off work yesterday to find a few missed calls from my son. When I called him back he tells me that his stepmom has now asked for the money from the check since it was “almost the same amount” they they spent on my college. She said it was obvious Id never “pay my debts” and that i would “just give him (my son) more money anyways” I’m stunned. I’m pissed. I don’t know what has possessed her to think to ask my son for money intended for his family. I tell my son to ignore her and i’ll handle it. 

So next I call my ex. It goes straight to voicemail. I try again a few minutes later and it’s the same thing. So I reluctantly call my ex’s wife and she answers immediately. I tell her the three of us (my ex, her, and me) need to meet first thing in the morning to discuss the “debt”. Im thinking this needs to happen in person with all three of us so there’s no confusion. She agrees. 

This morning we met at a coffee shop near my ex’s work. As soon as they sit down I say, “So [ex’s wife] want to tell me why you think it’s appropriate to ask my son for money?” My ex looks at her and says, “You asked [our son] for money?”

She starts, on about how she was only asking for the money they’re “owed” and she didn’t ask for more than was on the check. Then she says “For years we struggled due to paying for your school. For years we couldn’t afford a new car, a new house, or a nanny. My kids had to share a room.” She goes on about her “struggles” I started to tune her out because I keep thinking there’s no way she’s this deluded. 

It may have been inappropriate but I laughed. I literally took out thousands in credit card debt to keep me and my son afloat while my at the time husband was shacking up with her and PAYING HER BILLS. My ex looks at her and says “What the hell Sarah.”

I added “It’s laughable you think you’re owed anything from while you were a mistress. We were MARRIED when he paid for my schooling, it’s quite literally none of your business how he chose to spend money. You had zero entitlement to his money until you said ‘I do’ and from what I recall that wasn’t until years after the divorce was even finalized. Do not contact me or my son about this money again. You will NEVER see a dime from me.”

She rolls her eyes and gets up to leave. My ex tells her he’s going to stay for a minute. After she’s gone he asks why I didn’t just call him and tell him about what was going on, said he would’ve handled it and that it didn’t have to go this far. I say I did call him, twice actually and this is how we figured out she blocked my number from his phone. So those of you who said she’s just very insecure, you were absolutely correct. 

I tell him that she involved his sister, cousin, and his sister in law. That I got several calls and texts from them telling me I should just pay back my “debt” finally. I tell him that she involved the family and then asked our son for money intended for his baby. She’s crossed too many lines. He apologizes and says he’ll make sure she doesn’t bother me about it again. We both leave after that. 

My son told me he blocked her number and doesn’t want her at his house until she apologizes. That’s pretty much it for now. ",4,1744771960.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

1k0a85w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0a85w,Varia VS6 Review - the Pietro dethroned,"About 3 weeks ago, in a Pietro thread someone on here mentioned they didn’t use their Pietro anymore, as they found they were getting much clearer, better tasting pour overs with their Varia VS6 with Supernova Gold Titanium burrs. I’d never even heard of Varia, let alone the VS6, and was pretty surprised to see it also had 58mm blind burrs. I was more surprised/impressed to see the burrs were on carriers and perfectly level/calibrated so you didn’t have to go through an unpleasant shimming exercise - and you could even swap to conical burrs, in what was claimed to be under 2 minutes. 

I did a little research into Varia, and it seemed like their VS3 was a turd, which wasn’t inspiring. I was going to pass until I stumbled on an outstanding review of the VS6 from Tom’s Grinder Lab - where he mentioned it would show adorably against any ~$5k espresso OR pour over grinder, so I took the plunge and ordered the VS6 along with the Supernova Gold Titanium burrs.  

The grinder showed up last week, and I went to town with the stock burrs (the gold were shipped separately) brewing espresso and pour overs. The stock burrs are great for espresso and pour overs - and while I thought the stock burrs were noticing better than say an Ode 2 and about as good as a Timemore 078 - it certainly wasn’t as good as the Pietro. 

This weekend the Supernova Gold Titanium burrs showed up, and I immediately installed them (it truly took under 2 min) and put 10lbs of Prodigal seasoning beans through it. The seasoning beans were VERY hard and under-roasted (I can see why these were unsalable) but even loading the thing up to the gills with beans and running it at the lowest RPM (500) it never once stalled. Things were looking good.  

After I ran the 10lbs through it, I pulled the burrs to clean them before running expensive coffee through it, and I was shocked to find little to no residue/retention (see photo 6). 

The last four days I’ve been drinking a lot of coffee, and comparing the cups with the Pietro. While this is certainly not scientific, I did dial in both grinders to the best tasting cups for four different beans each - and used my R2 to ensure both were generating similar extraction and TDS percentages so it was as like for like as possible. The adjustment granularity for stepless VS6 gave it a clear advantage - but we all know the Pietro makes legendary cups. 

So before I go any further, let me just say I was a Barista and professional coffee roaster in the 90’s, and I’ve had professional equipment in my home for nearly 20 years (EK43, Double boiler espresso machines, Compak K10 WBC, LM GS3, etc). I have also been roasting coffee at home for over two decades, as I was always a light roast drinker, and back then - you really couldn’t buy it, you had to roast it yourself and you had to buy commercial equipment like the EK43 - as things like the ZP6, Pietro, or SSP burrs didn’t exist. This is all a wind up to say, while I don’t have a Q grader certification (it didn’t exist when I was a professional) - I do know how to roast, brew and taste coffee, so while I am just one opinion, I do have considerable experience and am not just a new hobbyist. 

Ok, with that ego flex out of the way - here are my initial thoughts. The Varia VS6 handily whips the Pietro in every way. There’s simply no variable where the Pietro outperforms the Varia. What’s more, there is a HUGE RPM (500 - 1600) range to play with, which substantially change your cup - the higher the RPM, the more fines and in turn the greater the body of the brew in your cup. At 500 RPM you get an incredibly uniform grind with a lightning bolt of balanced clarity. The electric acidity is present, but balanced with a sugarcube of sweetness. I could take beans like the PERC Deluga Gesha (in the photos) which I wasn’t a fan of the red grape flavor, as it was overpowering with the Pietro, toss them in the VS6 - coarsen up the grind, increase the RPM, and dial up the body and highlight the “fig newton” flavor more and crank up mouthfeel - while still maintaining clarity. This would result in a juicier cup than an 078, but with as much clarity as much or more clarity and flavor separation my Pietro. 

With some Prodigal COE Honduras #19 I could tighten up the grind a bit, reduce RPM to 500 and have the best clarity and flavor separation I’ve experienced. Cups have loads of acidity (which I LOVE) - but what sets these burrs apart is their ability to balance the acidity with a surprising amount of sweetness and a silky mouthfeel. My wife generally hates the ultra light roasted coffees I drink, and has never liked one - but I made her a cup of Yesica Moreno Chiroso from Sey this morning (TDS screenshot) and she thought it was “good.” While this doesn’t sound like a ringing endorsement on its own, she went from “gross” drinking that same coffee from my xBloom Studio (from an x-pod with a recipe card), to “take it back” from a popped pod ground on my Pietro and brewed on a Hario Switch - to “good” with a popped pod using the VS6. 

The three things that makes these burrs and the platform special are:
1. The gold titanium burrs are incredibly balanced AND provide extremes (sweetness, clarity, acidity) at the same time and their sweet spot seems to be the entire grind range. I’ve done espresso all the way up to cold brew - and it’s all been outstanding. 
2. The RPM range is incredibly wide and makes a big difference in cup which allow you to do a lot of flavor tuning, even on the same grind setting. 500 vs 1600 yields a big difference in cup at the grind settings I’m playing with. 
3. I find the workflow pleasant. Between the bellows and the knocker - if you RDT, it is among the cleanest grinder I’ve ever used and whatever weight of beans I put in it, I get back out every time, even if I take the burrs out and completely clean it, the first grind will give me my full weight in the grind cup. You don’t have to RDT with it at low RPM, but I tend to do it just to be consistent, as at higher RPM you generally want to. 

Now, like all things in life nothing is perfect (except for my wife if she’s reading this). My nits so far are:

1. The bellows that comes with the grinder sucks. It is comically large/tall, the material it is made out of is harder than it needs to be, and they made it so the metal cap for the grinder fits on top of it (which you can use without the bellows), which is a good idea in theory, but it makes the bellows more cumbersome, harder to use and it makes the grinder look goofy. I bought a $9 all rubber bellows on amazon designed for the Niche which fits perfectly, is much smaller and looks nicer - and best of all, it’s easier to use and works better. It’s the bellows you see in the first and last photo. 
2. The fines knocker feels goofy. It’s made out of aluminum, but still manages to feel cheap, and the process of pulling it down while sort of pinching it free from your grip makes me feel like I’m milking a robot. You can’t just pull it down and let go, as the spring isn’t that strong and the texture of the chute sort of sticks to your hand, so if you just let go it catches onto your fingers as your grip loosens and then doesn’t really “knock” if that makes sense. Once you get the hang of it, it does function well though.
3. On coarser settings, when you push down on the bellows (which puts pressure on the top carrier) with the grinder on, you hear the burrs going up and down, and you feel the springs that hold the top burr compress and the spinning burrs make a whirring sound. This doesn’t seem to be an issue per se, but I do wonder if over time those springs will need to be replaced, and as they degrade if that will cause setting drift, especially when hitting the bellows. The grinder, and all of its components feel very well made and it’s extremely heavy - so it is generally confidence inspiring, but if I took a video of the aforementioned you’d immediately go “ahh I get it.” In an otherwise premium feeling product - it is something that feels out of place. 

My prediction is that if the Varia VS6’s don’t fall apart after a year or two, these will become the new yardstick by which other grinders are measured against. This is the pour over sub, so I didn’t go into detail on spro, but it’s just as good for spro and these pour over specific burrs can be used for spro, and make surprisingly excellent espresso. I took a gamble buying this grinder - and with mixed experiences about their product quality - I’d still caution anyone buying one to know what you’re getting into. That said - if you’re a flavor chasing pour over junkie, I couldn’t imagine the Varia VS6 with seasoned gold titanium burrs not impressing you, regardless of whatever grinder you’re currently using. This is one opinion - but for me, it lives up to the hype. 

I can’t post pics and links in the same post - but do check out Tom’s Grinder Lab review of the Varia VS6 on YouTube. He goes into quite a bit of detail and his experience certainly matches mine. ",1,1744771863.0,pourover,0,0.67,False

I wanted to chill with my mother though. So we were drinking. Soon, we started fighting, over what, I don't know. It's always something. 

She started telling me to leave but my school ipad was in her room. I wanted to go get it. I went to go get it and she blocked me in the room, with her goons by her side. 

She stood there and started roasting me. She said I had a crush on her goons son, which I did, but okay. I was quiet and crying, as younger me would do. She locked me in her room. 

I wanted to get out. I was banging on the door and soon, I decided to break her window because it wouldn't open and I crawled out. I cut my stomach. 

I happened to run into a foster child from my foster place on the way down my mom's road. I told her what happened and she called the cops and our foster parents place. 

I wasn't thinking clearly. I was mad. I was humiliated. I went back and my mom was acting posh and asked me if I was ready to be calm, because she has witnesses here. She stood up and I started kicking her into her coffee table, a few times. She broke it after falling into it 4 times. Her goon pushed me back. 

We got into a fight and she bit the back of my arm. I left. The cops seen me, with a bloodied shirt and I'm not sure how I got to the hospital. 

I got in and my foster mom, God Bless her, seen me. She seemed sad. I got a shot for the bite and they stitched my tummy. 

When I went to see my mom a few weeks after, she told me I was crazy, that I never broke the window. That I we never fought. I started to piece together that my mom wasn't sound of mind. It's hard to explain.. I was almost lost like my mom.

 https://www.vernabanana.com/recipes/chocolate-mochi-brownies

I halved it to only make 6 large single serve brownies in a muffin pan. I halved the amount of sugar (yes, again), and creamed it into the butter before adding it to the dry ingredients. Then added the milk. And then dark chocolate chips, not included in the recipe. 

Took about 38 minutes in the oven at about 350, but my oven is wonky, and I'm unsure of the actual temperature. Will one day purchase a thermometer, but today isn't that day.

The ice cream is the bettergoods stuff from Walmart, which is pretty ok in my opinion. I used both a small scoop of the strawberry and blueberry varieties.

This is the 3rd time I've made these brownies, as I found them to be absolutely amazing in texture the first time. Chewy, and they have the crispy crunchy top I adore on a brownie. But it's vegan. The catch is you have to use mochi flour (glutinous rice flour), which can be found at Asian grocery stores or online.

I keep them in the fridge and pop one out and onto a cookie sheet to heat up in the oven for a few minutes while I make a cup of coffee or something to go with it. Delicious. Highly recommend.

The next one I eat will be plain, so I can properly appreciate the crunch. This was something I couldn't stop myself doing fresh out of the oven, tho. The warm brownie was begging for some fresh berries and ice cream.",4,1744771675.0,highvegans,0,1.0,False

Beans: Intelligentsia Black Cat Sapsucker. This is a light roast, a blend from Ethiopia and Guatemala. I ground 24 grams of beans and loaded the coffee reservoir, without tamping. Remarkably the reservoir wasn't quite full. To fill it would probably take 25 -- 26 grams. That's not a typo -- these beans are quite dense!

Grinder: 1Zpresso J-Ultra, at grind setting 3.00 

I started with cold (room temperature) water. I did not use an Aeropress filter*

Low heat -- 2/3 of the way  to Medium on my KitchenAid electric cooktop. Removed the pot from heat as soon as it started to splutter, and poured immediately into cups.

Result: Extracted nearly 180 ml of espresso from the initial 200 ml of water, for a 90% extraction rate. The small amount of water remaining in the boiler was absolutely clear.

Taste:  the fresh raw espresso included rich and mellow flavor notes that I don't yet know how to describe. But for the first time ever, I experienced the taste of ""sweetness"" in an espresso brew. And I detected no bitterness or sourness. 

Preparation: After the tasting, I mixed 90 ml of espresso with 1 cup of oat milk. Fantastic! 

I am at the end of a 12 oz bag, and I think I am finally close to ""dialing in"" for these beans! The good news is that I have another whole bag left to enjoy.

==========
*From previous experiments using filter papers, I am starting to think that the Aeropress filter compromises the gasket seal. With Aeropress filter I get only 50% to 60% extraction rate.

The machine's temperature management requirements are a common criticism, with many users suggesting that a machine at this price point should include a PID controller. The external control panel (or ""sidecar"") is also polarizing, with some users finding it unattractive.

Overall, Reddit users seem to agree that [the R58 Cinquantotto](https://go.shopmy.us/p-16254296) is a capable, well-built machine that will produce excellent espresso for years with proper maintenance, but they also suggest carefully considering alternatives and prioritizing [a quality grinder](https://go.shopmy.us/p-16255463) before investing in such an expensive machine.

## Switch Hiprex – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

Switch Hiprex stands out with its **real-time price tracking and market insights**. The system constantly monitors price movements and volatility, helping you react quickly to changes. This is especially helpful in crypto, where prices can swing dramatically in minutes.

The analysis tools aren't just for show either—they actually help you **fine-tune your trading strategies**. You can spot patterns and trends without needing a PhD in data science.

### User-Friendly Interface

Let’s be honest: most trading platforms look like they were designed by a NASA engineer in 1998. Not Switch Hiprex. The UI is **clean, intuitive, and easy on the eyes**.

The dashboard is laid out in a way that makes sense. You’ve got your balance, your active trades, analytics, and asset options all within reach. No endless clicking or confusing menus.

### Mobile Accessibility

As mentioned earlier, Switch Hiprex doesn’t yet have a standalone app, but the **mobile site is optimized well enough** that you can check your trades, make changes, and get alerts on the go.

Whether you're commuting, grabbing coffee, or chilling on the couch, you’ll still have full access to your trading tools.

### Customizable Alerts

One of the more underrated features, in my opinion. You can set **custom notifications for price changes, trade signals, or account activity**. If you don’t want to stare at charts all day but still want to stay in the loop, this is clutch.

The alerts are delivered in real-time and can be routed through email or in-browser popups.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Crypto? Check. Forex? Yup. Stocks and commodities? Also yes.

Switch Hiprex isn’t just a one-trick pony. You can diversify your portfolio and **trade various asset types from one central dashboard**. This makes it way easier to manage your investments without jumping between platforms.

## Is Switch Hiprex a Scam?

This is everyone’s first question—and for good reason. There are a ton of sketchy platforms out there.

From what I’ve seen and tested, **Switch Hiprex does not appear to be a scam**. It works with **regulated brokers**, has **transparent practices**, and offers a **demo account** so you can try it risk-free. That’s not the behavior of a platform trying to ghost you after a deposit.

Still, always use common sense: only trade what you can afford to lose and **do your own research**.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Switch Hiprex?

Switch Hiprex requires a **minimum deposit of $250** to activate your live trading account. This isn’t unusual—in fact, it’s pretty standard across platforms like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge.

The deposit is used as **your initial trading capital**, not a fee. You’ll be able to use it to place trades right away, and you can withdraw it anytime (assuming you haven’t lost it in the market, of course).

### Switch Hiprex Customer Support

Customer support is actually solid. You can reach them via:

- **Live chat** (usually gets a response in under 10 mins)
- **Email support**
- **Phone support** (only in select countries)

They’re available **24/7**, which is awesome for those of us who don’t trade on a 9-to-5 schedule. I fired off a few test questions and got helpful, human answers—not boilerplate copy-paste junk.

## How do you start trading on Switch Hiprex?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official Switch Hiprex site and fill out the quick sign-up form. They’ll ask for your name, email, and a phone number. It takes less than 2 minutes.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once you’re in, you’ll be connected to a **partner broker**. This is where you’ll need to **verify your identity** (standard KYC stuff) and make your **initial deposit of $250**.

### Step 3: Start Trading

After funding your account, you can either start **manual trading** or let the **auto-trading bot** do its thing. I recommend starting with the **demo mode** to test the waters before going live.

## How to Delete a Switch Hiprex Account?

If you decide Switch Hiprex isn’t for you, just reach out to customer support and request **account deletion**. They’ll walk you through the steps. Make sure to **withdraw all funds** before closing the account.

**Switch Hiprex is a solid choice** for beginner and intermediate traders looking for an easy-to-use, multi-asset trading platform. It’s not overly complicated, it doesn’t require hours of setup, and it gives you enough tools to actually feel in control of your trades.

Sure, it has room to grow—like adding a mobile app and more transparency about the team—but overall, it delivers on what it promises.

If you're tired of bloated platforms or just want something that works without the headache, **Switch Hiprex is worth a shot**.

ACT I: THE REQUIEM

EXT. MOUNT WUNDAGORE - NIGHT

A storm churns violently overhead. Crimson lightning arcs across the clouds. The mountain groans—loud, alive, almost in pain.

INT. MOUNT WUNDAGORE - THRESHOLD CHAMBER - NIGHT

CLOSE ON - STONE WALLS

Hairline fractures snake across the glyph-covered walls. The ancient rock groans, crumbles.

SFX: A low, growing RUMBLE builds into a metallic wail.

Chunks of stone begin to FALL.

CUT TO - WANDA MAXIMOFF

She stands alone at the center, dust in her hair, eyes red-rimmed—not from power, from fear.

Her breath is shallow. Rapid.

She looks up—

CRACK—another slab crashes down behind her.

CLOSE ON - HER HANDS

They lift, instinctively. Not casting. Not summoning.

Just shielding. 

A human reflex.

WIDE SHOT - THE CHAMBER

The ceiling gives. Stone crashes downward.

Wanda—no longer glowing, no longer godlike—curls inward.

She doesn’t run.

She doesn’t fight.

She just braces.

CUT TO - EXT. MOUNT WUNDAGORE - NIGHT

From the outside, the mountain’s peak implodes inward—a violent collapse. Dust clouds mushroom outward.

SILENCE.

Then—

A SCREAM.

SFX: A high-pitched, wraith-like SHRIEK—layered with a very real, very human scream.

It doesn’t come from Wanda’s mouth. 

It comes from the impact point.

WIDE - THE MOUNTAIN’S FACE

RED AND BLACK MAGIC blasts out in opposite directions—violent, unnatural, like energy being rejected by the earth.

The sound is unbearable. It shreds the silence, echoes through the valley.

Then—

STILLNESS.

Only dust now.

Only ruin.

CLOSE ON - THE COLLAPSE SITE

A single tendril of smoke-red energy flickers briefly from beneath the rubble.

It quivers.

Then slithers back under.

BLACK SCREEN.

FAINT SFX:

A breath. Small. Sharp. Not Wanda’s.

New.

FADE OUT.

TEXT ON SCREEN: “Six Months Later.”

SFX: Faint echoes—newscasters overlapping, distorted.

“Where is she?”

“…the mountain collapse…”

“…no sign of the body…”

“…no official Avengers roster since—”

FADE IN:

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM – DAY

A civics teacher stands in front of a flickering screen. The slide reads:

""THE SOKOVIA ACCORDS: REPEALED OR REWRITTEN?""

Students barely pay attention. One slouches with earbuds in. Another scrolls her phone.

STUDENT

So... like... what happens if someone with laser eyes

blows up a building now?

TEACHER

The Global Repatriation Council is working on updated legislation.

A pause.

STUDENT #2

What happened to the Avengers?

The teacher falters.

The screen shifts to a faded image of the original team. Static ripples across their faces.

FLASHBACK - AVENGERS COMPOUND

INT. VISION’S ROOM – NIGHT

The room is quiet. Too quiet.

Only the soft pacing of Vision—gliding across the floor in deliberate steps.

Hands clasped behind his back. Posture perfect.

But his shoulders are tight. His jaw clenched.

The synthetic jewel in his forehead flickers—nervous energy.

A single screen floats beside him.

Equations shift and reconfigure: quantum loop theories, entropy paradoxes.

He stares, but his eyes are somewhere else.

VISION

“If particle spin could destabilize probability long enough to recalibrate phase transitions, perhaps—”

He stops.

Mid-thought.

Her face flashes behind his eyes.

⸻

FLASH – WANDA LAUGHING

Bathed in golden kitchen light.

Hair falling across her eyes—she brushes it back.

An oversized sweater slips off her shoulder.

Vision swallows.

⸻

He turns away sharply, like he can physically outrun the memory.

The screen reshapes—layering on another theory.

More complexity. More noise.

But the thoughts keep coming.

Wanda, leaning over the sink.

Her sleeves rolled up.

The sound of her voice saying his name in that unguarded, low tone.

The thought of—

kissing her.

⸻

He closes his eyes.

Inhales.

VISION

“It is illogical. It is… intrusive. It is—”

He stops again.

His hand drifts to his chest.

Where a heartbeat should live.

He doesn’t understand it. Not fully.

But when he thinks of her…

There’s a pull.

A heat.

A yearning.

Something beyond data.

Beyond circuitry.

Something human.

⸻

He sits on the edge of his bed.

Still. Silent.

The glow of unsolved equations flickers beside him.

But all he can see is the way Wanda looked at him earlier—

Not like Jarvis.

Not like a weapon.

Not like a machine.

But like a man.

Like he was seen.

⸻

VISION

“I wish to comfort her.

To understand her pain.

But I also…

I wish to hold her.”

He opens his eyes—soft, wide, almost afraid.

VISION

“I wish… to be held in return.”

The screen fades to black.

He lets it.

Because tonight, no equation will soothe the ache in his chest.

Only she could do that.

And maybe tomorrow—

He’ll try.

He’ll make her chicken paprikash.

But tonight—

He sits in the quiet.

Longing for a girl with chaos in her bones,

and kindness in her smile.

⸻

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND – COMMON ROOM – NIGHT

Soft light flickers from the screen—blues and grays washing over the room.

WANDA is curled up on the couch. Blanket cocoon. Eyes glassy—not from the movie.

The Notebook plays softly. Rain. Kissing. Heartbreak.

Background noise to the storm she’s holding in.

A gentle knock on the doorframe.

She looks up.

VISION stands there.

Arms at his sides. Slightly awkward. Almost… shy.

VISION

“Forgive the interruption. I… found Euler’s conjecture unexpectedly complex tonight. I wondered if you—”

(beat)

“—might like some company.”

Wanda blinks.

Euler’s conjecture?

Her heart does something it shouldn’t.

She pats the cushion beside her.

WANDA

“Sure. Unless you’re worried Ryan Gosling’s emotional arc will prove equally… complex.”

A soft hum escapes Vision. Not quite a laugh.

More like relieved amusement.

He enters.

Pauses.

Looks at her.

Looks at the couch.

Then—sits.

Tentative. Upright. Respectful.

Like she’s royalty.

Wanda shifts. Tries to refocus on the movie.

Fails.

Her pulse is loud.

⸻

A beat later—

NATASHA walks past the open door. Stops.

She glances at the two of them—too close to be casual, too stiff to be comfortable.

Raises an eyebrow.

NATASHA

(dry)

“Huh.”

She smirks. Walks away.

Wanda stifles a laugh.

Vision stares forward like the screen might swallow him.

⸻

Time passes.

Scene after scene—they drift.

Inch by inch.

Shoulders almost touch. Then—

They do.

Wanda leans in, barely.

She feels him. Warm.

Too warm for synthetic parts.

WANDA

“You must be freezing.”

(beat)

“Come on… share the blanket.”

Vision looks at the blanket like it’s radioactive.

VISION

“I… am not certain I can feel cold in the traditional sense, but—”

WANDA

(teasing)

“But?”

He looks at her.

Really looks.

Her smile.

Her eyes.

The way her voice softens when she’s teasing him.

He swallows.

(Why? He doesn’t need to. But something in his design mimics the human response to overwhelming emotion.)

VISION

(softly)

“Perhaps… I could benefit from a degree of warmth.”

He pulls the blanket over them.

Their shoulders touch.

Then thighs.

Then—

nothing else exists.

⸻

He catches the scent of her hair.

She glances at his lips.

Both aching.

Neither ready.

But closer now.

Always closer.

⸻The movie hits that scene.

Rain. Desperation. The lovers collide—devouring each other.

Suddenly—

Wanda and Vision aren’t watching the movie.

The movie is watching them.

⸻

She leans against him now.

Head on his shoulder. Body relaxed.

But her breathing?

Shallow.

Fast.

Rising.

Her neckline shifts under the blanket.

Her skin, pink and glowing in the light.

Vision doesn’t turn his head.

But he knows.

He shifts in his seat.

Reaches for a nearby pillow.

Quick. Strategic.

But not quick enough.

Wanda notices.

⸻

She says nothing.

Just keeps breathing.

Soft. Heavy.

Vision feels each breath like it’s his own.

Sees her collarbone rise and fall.

The flutter in her throat.

The pulse that jumps when his arm brushes hers.

He’s aching.

And for the first time—he doesn’t want it to stop.

⸻

Her fingers graze his knee beneath the blanket.

On-screen—sounds of ecstasy, gasps, skin meeting skin.

In the silence between them—

only tension.

⸻

Vision stares at the screen like a lifeline.

But his processors are failing him.

They stay like that.

No words.

Because the spell might break.

And neither is ready for that.

The movie ends.

Credits roll in soft piano and rain.

The room is silver and shadow.

Still. Electric.

His arm—now behind her on the couch.

Not touching.

But near.

⸻

Wanda blinks slowly.

She’s not watching the screen.

She’s listening—

To the hum in his chest.

To the stillness.

She turns slightly.

Looks up.

He’s already looking at her.

⸻

Their eyes meet.

This time—

Neither looks away.

⸻

WANDA

(soft)

“You stayed.”

VISION

(barely audible)

“I didn’t want to go.”

A beat.

The air, thick. Charged.

Like a wire pulled tight.

⸻

WANDA

(gentle, small smile)

“You never said if the conjecture got any easier.”

VISION

(soft, honest)

“It did not.”

Their eyes lock.WANDA

(smirking)

I sense your mind analyzing me. Go on then. Analyze me.

VISION

(polite, curious)

In what sense?

WANDA

Emotionally. Psychologically. Whatever your circuits do.

(beat)

I can take it.

VISION

Very well.

(beat, straight-faced)

Your breathing is shallow — approximately seventeen breaths per minute.

Heart rate elevated — 112 bpm. Likely due to proximity.

Pupils dilated. Indicating either low light or… heightened— 

WANDA Ok, ok. I think we get it.She laughs playfully. Then suddenly–

Her gaze drops.

To his lips.

His jaw.

Back to his eyes.

She swallows.

He blinks once. Then again.

⸻

VISION

(softly)

“Wanda…”

Her name leaves him like a prayer.

And in that moment—

He doesn’t move.

But something shatters in his expression.

So full of longing.

Fear.

Reverence.

Wanda forgets how to breathe.

⸻

She shifts closer. Slowly.

With purpose.

Her fingers trail down his arm.

Find his hand.

Lace with his.

He looks down.

Like he can’t believe it’s real.

⸻

WANDA

(quiet)

“I don’t know what this is yet.”

VISION

(bare breath)

“Nor do I.”

She leans against him again.

This time—

He leans into her.

Lets his head rest against hers.

Lets his fingers tighten slightly around hers.

And in that hush—

that heartbeat neither of them should have—

they sit.

Not as witch and android.

Not as weapon and machine.

But as two souls choosing the ache.

Choosing the stillness.

Choosing each other.

⸻

EXT. BARTON FAMILY FARM – EARLY MORNING

The world is quiet.

The Barton home glows warm—filled with the smell of breakfast, the sound of laughter.

LILA and COOPER argue playfully at the kitchen table.

LAURA kisses CLINT on the cheek, smiling.

CLINT watches them, coffee in hand.

But… he’s not really there.

FLASH – MEMORY

RONIN stands over a corpse, chest heaving. Blood streaks across his blade.

BACK TO PRESENT

Clint blinks. Hard.

Shakes it off.

LAURA sees it. She knows that look.

LAURA

(gently, knowing)

Hey. Where’d you go?

Clint forces a small smile.

But then—ANOTHER FLASH.

⸻

FLASHBACK – VORMIR

The wind howls.

A violet sky, vast and empty.

NATASHA clings to the cliff’s edge—her hand locked in Clint’s.

Her face is calm. Her voice, firm.

NATASHA

(softly, unwavering)

Let me go.

Clint grips tighter.

A beat. He shakes his head, barely breathing.

CLINT

(a whisper, broken)

I can’t.

Natasha smiles—just a little.

And then… her legs kick off the cliff wall, creating enough force to shake his grip loose.

⸻

BACK TO PRESENT

Clint’s coffee cup trembles in his hand.

He sets it down.

Eyes locked on nothing.

The sound of laughter fades behind him.

Clint stands.

Walks away from the table.

Laura watches him go.

She says nothing.

CUT TO BLACK.

⸻

EXT. FOREST CLEARING – EARLY MORNING

Mist clings to the trees. The earth is still. Somewhere in the woods, a figure stirs.

WANDA lies in the dirt—disoriented, trembling, alive.

Her fingers are blackened, her body weak.

She blinks up at the sky—confused. Empty.

She doesn’t remember who she is.

She doesn’t remember her magic.

She only knows: something inside her is broken.

She pushes herself up.

Staggers to her feet.

Nearby, a shallow river.

She catches her reflection in the water—

But doesn’t recognize it.

Her fingers instinctively twitch.

A faint flicker of red—then nothing.

FLASHES – QUICK CUTS

— A bomb explodes in Sokovia.

— VISION’S lifeless body.

— Screams echo through Kamar-Taj.

— Chaos. Fire. Loss.

BACK TO SCENE

Wanda clutches her head.

She drops to her knees — gasping.She doesn’t understand what’s happening.

She can’t tell her dreams from reality anymore.

SHE’S ALSO NOT ALONE.

I wanted to share a bit of what I’ve been going through lately, in case anyone can relate or has any advice.

For the past year or so, my workload has increased significantly. I work from home, Monday to Friday, for at least 11 hours a day in front of a screen (I'm a graphic designer). This change has brought a lot of stress into my life. I *function* — I can work, socialize, and meet deadlines — but deep down I know I’m not okay.

Over time, I started developing what I believe are symptoms of GERD (acid reflux). At first, I thought it was due to irritants like coffee or spicy food, but after paying closer attention, I noticed the symptoms **always** show up after something triggers my anxiety. Certain eating habits definitely make it worse, but the real trigger seems to be emotional.

For me, anxiety manifests as intense reflux and persistent nausea — which makes me feel really miserable. The weird (or maybe not so weird) part is that I’ve experienced this since I was a kid. It’s like my body has always processed anxiety this way, but now it's way worse.

I've been trying to make some changes:

* I go for a short walk in the park after work, even if it’s just for 30 minutes, to disconnect and be around nature.
* I work out three times a week.
* Try to work less, or at least, to distribute my workload smarter.
* I’ve had therapy before and I do have some tools that help me manage things better.

Still, I feel kind of alone in this experience. It’s frustrating to be in moments where I should be enjoying myself or simply being *present*, but my body shifts into discomfort and unease. Then the guilt kicks in, the self-blame… and it becomes a tough cycle to break.

If anyone has gone through something similar or has any tips — whether it’s techniques for managing anxiety or even just a tea or supplement that helps — I’d really appreciate hearing about it. I don’t feel like my anxiety is severe enough to need full-on medication, but it’s definitely affecting my quality of life.

Thank you so much. ",1,1744770846.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

When I first moved to Lakeland a decade ago, I couldn't have predicted how our city would evolve into a thriving digital ecosystem. Today, Lakeland isn't just known for its beautiful lakes and historic downtown—it's becoming recognized as a hub for top-tier web development talent, particularly in the WordPress space.

As someone who's been developing WordPress websites here for the past eight years, I've witnessed firsthand how our local development community has matured. What sets Lakeland apart isn't just technical skill—it's our developers' innate understanding of the local business landscape, from the unique challenges facing Swan City's retail sector to the specific needs of our growing professional services firms.

Whether you're a small business owner looking to establish your first online presence or an established company seeking a website overhaul, Lakeland's WordPress development agencies offer the perfect blend of technical expertise and local business acumen that national firms simply can't match.

# Top [WordPress Development Agencies](https://coderlift.com/) in Lakeland

Having collaborated with (and occasionally competed against) most of Lakeland's web development agencies, I can attest to the exceptional talent we have in our community. Each agency brings its own unique strengths and specializations to the table:

# Ritchey Creative

Walking into Ritchey Creative's office downtown, you immediately sense their commitment to craftsmanship. This team doesn't just build websites—they create digital experiences that perfectly align with their clients' brands.

Their specialty in premium WordPress design and development has made them the go-to choice for Lakeland businesses that refuse to compromise on quality. What truly distinguishes Ritchey Creative, though, is their almost fanatical dedication to customer service. I've heard numerous business owners remark that working with them feels more like a partnership than a vendor relationship.

One project that particularly impressed me was their work for a local boutique hotel—the attention to detail in capturing the property's unique character while ensuring seamless booking functionality demonstrated their ability to balance aesthetics with functionality.

# Thrive Internet Marketing Agency

If you're looking for an all-in-one digital solution, Thrive offers perhaps the most comprehensive service package in Lakeland. Their team excels at seeing the bigger picture—how your WordPress website fits into your overall marketing strategy.

What I appreciate about Thrive is their integrated approach. Rather than treating design, development, and marketing as separate silos, they construct WordPress websites specifically engineered to drive your marketing goals. This holistic perspective means their sites aren't just visually appealing; they're conversion machines built from the ground up.

Their work with several Lakeland restaurants has been particularly notable, creating sites that not only showcase menus beautifully but also drive reservations and online orders through strategically designed user journeys.

# DigiSquid

Few agencies in Lakeland can match DigiSquid's technical expertise when it comes to custom WordPress theme development. While many shops rely heavily on pre-built themes, DigiSquid excels at creating truly bespoke solutions.

Their team serves both Lakeland proper and the broader Polk County area, bringing specialized WordPress knowledge to businesses that need more than a cookie-cutter solution. I've been particularly impressed with their ability to translate complex functionality requirements into elegant, user-friendly interfaces.

A standout example was their work for a local real estate firm, where they built a custom property search function that dramatically outperformed the standard solutions in terms of both performance and user experience.

# Web Lakeland

Sometimes you meet a company whose reputation precedes them, and Web Lakeland is definitely one of those agencies. In conversations with local business owners, I consistently hear praise for their attentive service and responsiveness.

Their deep understanding of the Lakeland market gives them an edge when it comes to creating websites that resonate with local consumers. Having lived and worked in Lakeland for years, their team innately understands the community's preferences and expectations.

Their portfolio of small business websites demonstrates their ability to deliver professional results without unnecessary complexity—perfect for local businesses that need quality without excessive bells and whistles.

# Why Choose a Local Lakeland WordPress Developer

""Can't I just hire any WordPress developer? Why does it matter if they're based in Lakeland?""

I hear this question frequently, and while there are certainly talented WordPress developers worldwide, there are compelling advantages to choosing a local Lakeland agency:

# Local Business Understanding

When you work with a developer who regularly shops at Publix on Lake Miriam, cheers at Lakeland Flying Tigers games, and attends First Friday events downtown, you're getting someone who inherently understands your customer base.

I've seen countless examples where this local knowledge translated into more effective websites. A national developer might create a beautiful site, but a local developer creates a site that speaks directly to Lakeland consumers. They understand the competitive landscape—whether you're competing with businesses on Kentucky Avenue or across Polk County.

# Face-to-Face Collaboration

In our increasingly remote world, there's still immense value in sitting across a table from your developer. Those in-person meetings at Mitchell's Coffee House or Fresco's often yield insights that would never emerge from a Zoom call.

The ability to meet in person streamlines the development process, reduces miscommunication, and creates stronger working relationships. I've found that clients who meet regularly with their developers report higher satisfaction with both the process and the final product.

# Community Connections

Local WordPress developers bring an entire network of connections that can benefit your business. Need professional photography for your website? They likely know the best photographers in Lakeland. Looking for content writers familiar with your industry? Their local network probably includes several options.

These established relationships with other Lakeland businesses create an ecosystem of support that extends far beyond website development.

# Supporting Local Economy

Every dollar spent with a local WordPress developer circulates through our community multiple times. When you choose a Lakeland developer, you're not just getting a website—you're investing in our city's growing tech sector and overall economic health.

As someone deeply invested in Lakeland's continued growth, I can confidently say that our technology community flourishes when local businesses choose to work with local developers.

# Common WordPress Services Offered by Lakeland Developers

The WordPress ecosystem has evolved dramatically since its inception, and Lakeland's developers have evolved with it. Today, local agencies offer a comprehensive suite of WordPress-related services:

# Custom WordPress Website Design

The days of cookie-cutter WordPress templates are long behind us. Lakeland's top agencies create completely custom designs that reflect your brand's unique identity while adhering to modern design principles.

What separates professional custom design from DIY approaches is the strategic thinking behind every element. When I work with clients, we're not just making aesthetic choices—we're designing conversion pathways, strategically placing calls-to-action, and creating visual hierarchies that guide users toward desired actions.

The result is a website that not only looks distinctively yours but also functions as an effective business tool rather than just a digital brochure.

# E-commerce Solutions

The pandemic accelerated e-commerce adoption across Lakeland, and local WordPress developers responded by deepening their WooCommerce expertise. Today, Lakeland agencies can build sophisticated online stores that rival major e-commerce platforms.

These solutions include secure payment processing integration with providers like Stripe and PayPal, inventory management systems, shipping calculation tools, and mobile-optimized shopping experiences. Whether you're selling handcrafted goods from your Dixieland workshop or managing a large retail operation, local developers can create a WordPress e-commerce solution scaled to your needs.

# WordPress Maintenance and Support

A website is never truly ""finished""—it requires ongoing care to remain secure, functional, and up-to-date. Recognizing this reality, most Lakeland WordPress agencies offer comprehensive maintenance packages.

These typically include regular core updates, plugin maintenance, security monitoring, malware scanning, performance optimization, and regular backups. Many also provide emergency support for those inevitable moments when something goes wrong at the worst possible time.

For Lakeland business owners, these maintenance packages provide peace of mind and allow them to focus on running their business rather than worrying about website security or functionality issues.

# Website Migrations and Redesigns

Many Lakeland businesses find themselves trapped on outdated platforms or struggling with WordPress sites built by inexperienced developers. Local agencies specialize in seamless migrations—whether from platforms like Wix and Squarespace to WordPress or from poorly implemented WordPress sites to properly structured ones.

These migration projects require significant technical expertise to ensure no content is lost, SEO rankings are preserved, and the new site launches without disruption to your business. Lakeland developers have refined these processes through years of experience, creating methodical approaches that minimize risk during these transitions.

# WordPress Optimization for Lakeland Local SEO

Having your beautiful new WordPress site is only half the battle—you need potential customers to find it. This is where localized SEO strategies become crucial:

# Lakeland-Focused SEO Strategies

Local WordPress developers implement highly targeted SEO approaches focused specifically on Lakeland and Polk County searches. This includes:

* **Strategic keyword targeting**: Optimizing for terms like ""Lakeland florist"" rather than just ""florist""
* **Local content development**: Creating neighborhood guides, local event coverage, and community-focused resources that establish local relevance
* **Technical SEO implementation**: Ensuring your WordPress site's technical foundation supports strong local search visibility

I've seen businesses transform their customer acquisition after implementing these locally-focused SEO strategies. One Lakeland restaurant client saw a 43% increase in reservations after we optimized their WordPress site for local search terms and implemented proper schema markup.

# Local Business Integration

Beyond on-site optimization, Lakeland WordPress developers can integrate your site with critical local business platforms:

* **Google Business Profile optimization**: Ensuring your WordPress site and Google Business Profile work in harmony with consistent information and cross-linking
* **Local directory integration**: Connecting your site with the Lakeland Chamber of Commerce directory, Lakeland Downtown Development Authority listings, and other local business resources
* **Schema markup implementation**: Adding specialized code that helps search engines understand your local business information, including location, hours, and services

These integrations create a web of local relevance that significantly improves your visibility in Lakeland-specific searches.

# The WordPress Development Process

Understanding how Lakeland agencies approach WordPress development helps set realistic expectations and ensures a smoother project experience:

# Initial Consultation and Discovery

Every successful project begins with thorough discovery. Local developers typically start with comprehensive discussions about your business goals, target audience, competitors, and specific functionality requirements.

During this phase, experienced developers analyze your current online presence (if applicable), identify strengths and weaknesses, and begin formulating strategic recommendations. This discovery often includes competitor analysis specifically within the Lakeland market to identify opportunities for differentiation.

The outcome of this phase should be a clearly defined project scope, preliminary timeline, and budget parameters.

# Design and Planning

With project parameters established, Lakeland WordPress developers move into the design phase:

* **Wireframing**: Creating structural blueprints that outline the website's information architecture and user flows
* **UX planning**: Mapping user journeys based on the specific needs of your Lakeland customer base
* **Responsive design planning**: Ensuring optimal experiences across devices, particularly important as mobile usage continues to grow among Lakeland consumers

The design phase typically involves collaborative review sessions where you provide feedback on visual direction before development begins.

# Development Phase

Once designs are approved, developers bring your WordPress site to life:

* **Theme development**: Either custom-coding a theme specifically for your business or customizing a premium framework
* **Plugin integration**: Carefully selecting and configuring the optimal plugins for your specific needs
* **Custom functionality development**: Programming any specialized features unique to your business requirements
* **Content implementation**: Populating the site with your content, optimized for both users and search engines

Throughout development, Lakeland agencies typically provide access to a staging environment where you can preview progress.

# Testing and Launch

Before your site goes live, comprehensive testing ensures everything functions flawlessly:

* **Cross-browser testing**: Verifying compatibility across Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge
* **Device testing**: Confirming optimal performance on various screen sizes
* **Performance optimization**: Fine-tuning loading speeds to meet Google's Core Web Vitals standards
* **Security verification**: Implementing and testing security measures

When everything meets quality standards, the launch is carefully orchestrated to minimize any potential disruption to your business operations.

# Training and Handoff

The final phase involves transferring knowledge to your team:

* **WordPress dashboard training**: Personalized instruction on content management
* **Documentation provision**: Custom guides for your specific site configuration
* **Post-launch support**: Defined processes for addressing any issues that arise after launch

Lakeland developers typically offer more hands-on training options than remote agencies, including in-person sessions at your office or their studio.

#  <<< Expert WordPress Developers Ready → [Book Your Project in 60 Seconds](https://coderlift.com/services/wordpress-development/) >>>

# WordPress Technology and Tools

The technical foundation of your WordPress site significantly impacts its performance, security, and long-term viability. Here's what Lakeland's top developers typically employ:

# Premium WordPress Themes and Frameworks

While some clients assume all WordPress sites use off-the-shelf themes, professional Lakeland developers typically use either:

* **Premium frameworks** like GeneratePress, Astra, or Kadence as starting points for custom development
* **Page builders** like Elementor Pro, Beaver Builder, or Divi for more complex layouts
* **Fully custom themes** built from scratch for clients with specific requirements

The approach varies based on project requirements and budget considerations, but the focus remains on creating unique designs rather than cookie-cutter templates.

# Essential WordPress Plugins

Experienced developers are highly selective about plugins, choosing only well-maintained, secure options that add genuine value:

* **Performance tools**: WP Rocket, Imagify, or similar caching and optimization solutions
* **Security enhancements**: Wordfence, Sucuri, or comparable security suites
* **SEO implementation**: Rank Math, Yoast SEO, or similar platforms for search optimization
* **Form management**: Gravity Forms, WPForms, or Formidable Forms for lead capture

Lakeland developers typically avoid overlapping plugin functionalities and regularly audit plugins to remove unnecessary ones that might slow your site.

# Hosting and Technical Infrastructure

Your hosting environment dramatically affects site performance and security. Local WordPress developers generally recommend:

* **Managed WordPress hosting** from providers like WP Engine, Kinsta, or Flywheel for optimal performance
* **Server configurations** specifically optimized for WordPress sites
* **Content delivery networks** (CDNs) to ensure fast loading times for visitors regardless of location

Many Lakeland agencies offer hosting packages that include regular maintenance, and creating a complete care plan for your WordPress site.

# Choosing the Right Lakeland WordPress Developer

With several quality options available in Lakeland, how do you select the right partner for your project?

# Questions to Ask Potential Developers

When evaluating Lakeland WordPress agencies, consider asking:

* **Can I see examples of WordPress sites you've built for businesses similar to mine?** Look for experience in your specific industry or with similar functionality requirements.
* **What is your typical development timeline for a project like mine?** Beware of unrealistically short timeframes that might indicate corner-cutting.
* **How do you handle project management and communication?** Ensure their process aligns with your communication preferences.
* **What happens after my site launches?** Understand their approach to support, maintenance, and ongoing optimization.
* **Who will own the website and all associated accounts?** Confirm you'll have full ownership of all assets and accounts.

The answers to these questions often reveal more about an agency's approach than their marketing materials.

# Red Flags to Watch For

In my years working in Lakeland's WordPress community, I've identified several warning signs that should give you pause:

* **Unusually low pricing**: Quality WordPress development requires significant time and expertise. If a quote seems too good to be true, it probably is.
* **Vague deliverables**: Be wary of proposals that don't clearly outline exactly what you'll receive.
* **Limited or hidden portfolio**: Reputable developers proudly showcase their work. If they can't or won't show examples, there's usually a reason.
* **No maintenance plan**: Any developer who suggests a WordPress site doesn't need ongoing maintenance doesn't understand the platform.
* **Poor communication during the sales process**: If they're difficult to reach before you're a client, imagine how they'll be afterward.

Trust your instincts—if something feels off during initial discussions, it's usually better to explore other options.

# Budget Considerations

WordPress development investments in Lakeland vary widely based on project complexity, but understanding the value equation helps set realistic expectations:

* **Value vs. cost**: The cheapest option rarely delivers the best long-term value. Consider the potential revenue impact of a high-performing site versus a mediocre one.
* **Total cost of ownership**: Factor in ongoing maintenance, updates, and eventual redesign needs when budgeting.
* **ROI timeframe**: Discuss with potential developers how quickly you might recoup your investment through new business or improved efficiency.

Most Lakeland developers are willing to work with you to phase implementation if budget constraints require it, prioritizing the most critical elements first.

# WordPress Website Pricing in Lakeland

While every project is unique, here are the general price ranges you can expect from professional WordPress developers in Lakeland:

# Typical Project Ranges

* **Basic WordPress websites** ($1,500-$5,000): Brochure-style sites with standard functionality, suitable for service businesses or professional practices.
* **Mid-range business websites** ($5,000-$15,000): More complex sites with custom functionality, content management systems, and advanced design elements.
* **E-commerce websites** ($7,500-$20,

# Conclusion

After a decade immersed in Lakeland's web development community, I've witnessed firsthand how our local WordPress ecosystem has matured into something truly special. What sets our city's WordPress developers apart isn't just technical skill—though there's certainly plenty of that—it's the unique combination of expertise and community connection that creates exceptional value for local businesses.

When you partner with a Lakeland-based WordPress developer, you're getting more than lines of code and design elements.

Some excel at premium design, others at marketing integration, and still others at technical implementation. What they share is a commitment to serving Lakeland businesses with integrity and skill.

As our city continues to grow and evolve, having a strong online presence isn't just advantageous—it's essential. Your WordPress website often serves as the first impression for potential customers, and that first impression needs to be compelling, professional, and aligned with your business goals.

Whether you're launching a new venture, refreshing an outdated site, or expanding your e-commerce capabilities, Lakeland's WordPress development community stands ready to help transform your digital vision into reality.

I encourage you to reach out to several of the agencies mentioned here, discuss your specific needs, and find the development partner that feels right for your business. After all, the relationship between a business and its web developer often extends far beyond the initial project, becoming a long-term partnership in digital success.

The mall covers a gross leasable area of 30 million square feet (2,800,000 m^(2)), making it the largest shopping mall in the world, surpassing the Iran Mall in Tehran, Iran, and the largest mall in the United States, surpassing the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota and American Dream Miami in Miami, Florida. The Delmarva Mall is being owned and managed by the Simon Property Group in 80% and Triple Five Group in 50%, in which the two owners will share the mall together. When approved and completed, this mall is expected to attract over 1 trillion people annually in and out of the United States in a 6,000-mile (10,000 km) radius, making the shopping mall the most visited place on Earth. This kind of large shopping mall is being classified as a megamall, now defined universally by the International Council of Shopping Centers – shopping mall with over 3,000,000 square feet (280,000 m^(2)) of gross leasable area and contain four anchor atores and an entertainment complex.

The mall is completely 10 stories tall, with five upper floors and five basements. The total amount of stores and services is estimated to be over 3,000. Anchor stores will include Macy's, Nordstrom, JCPenny, and Bloomingdale's, while other retailers include H&M, ZARA, Uniqlo, Old Navy, Forever 21, Gap, and the Lego store. In addition, there is the VinFast car dealer (Vietnamese multinational automative company founded by Vingroup) on basement 5, food court on the fourth floor, AMC movie theater on the fifth floor, and the indoor ice skating rink on basement 5. Many escalators and elevators are scattered around the mall to encourage shoppers to move up and downwards between ten floors. The directory boards will show both the Simon Property Group and Triple Five Group interface, e.g. the code of conduct and the directory map. Moreover, the Delmarva Mall will be the tallest shopping mall in the United States and the world, by floor count and the interior of the mall height.

# Further Information and Layout

The Delmava Mall will include 5 six-story parking garages (with five basement levels) and 3 large parking lots for all vehicles, plus eight five-story underground parkings for cars, vans, motorcycles, and bicycles. Entrances leading into atriums are labeled in the numerical order, with the first mall entrance near Macy's. By drive, the mall is accessible via U.S. Route 50 (Ocean Gateway), U.S. Route 113, Maryland Route 90 (Ocean City Expressway), and Maryland Route 589 from Ocean City and Salisbury, which takes around 9–30 minutes to arrive. Also, the transit bus includes a stop at the northwest parking lot of the Delmarva Mall, and the proposal Salisbury Metro—a rapid transit system serving the Salisbury metropolitan area—will include a station near Parking Garage B of the Delmarva Mall too, connected to the mall's basement 1 floor via a long corridor. The layout of the Delmarva Mall is designed with a tall central atrium running east to west from Macy's to Tropical World, of which the two side atriums leads south to north from Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's to JCPenny and Nickeledeon Universe.

The mall houses a proposed four-star, 20-story hotel named Holiday Inn & Suites Ocean City, which is owned under the brand of IHG Hotels & Resorts. In addition, there is a proposed 3,600,000-square-foot (330,000 m^(2); 80-acre) indoor amusement park on basement 5 called Nickeledeon Universe, which is themed to Nickeledeon's popular franchises, and it's the largest indoor amusement park in the United States. A large proposed 4,200,000-square-foot (390,000 m^(2); 100-acre) indoor tropical-themed water park at the first floor dubbed Tropical World, also called Universal Volcano Bay 2, is designed with a tropical-like paradise and atmospheric experience for guests, similar to the Universal Volcano Bay in Orlando, Florida. Also, three resort hotels with indoor water parks are planned outside but near the Delmarva Mall, including Great Wolf Lodge, Kalahari Resorts & Convention Center, and Camelbeach Resort, each two are connected to the mall via automated people movers (APMs).

[Layout of the Delmarva Mall highlighted mostly in gray and sliver](https://preview.redd.it/tvk59vsei1ve1.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=14f44075c5915937c120b5dce1e256da80da105c)

# Project Approval and Status

The Delmarva Mall is a large shopping mall and entertainment complex related to other projects including Interstate 97 (Ocean City Expressway), Interstate 1, Interstate 497 (Salisbury–Ocean City Freeway), and Salisbury–Ocean City metropolitan area. This project is considered a hypothesis and was yet not approved by official sources. Until workers and authorities are able to improve the standards of budget cost, moving houses to new communities, and facing several challenges, the project can be approved at anytime and the mall will start construction in the future. Roads and streets that are in the Delmarva Mall project will be demolished or moved to avoid obstruction.

# Holiday Inn & Suites Delmarva Mall

The Holiday Inn & Suites is a **proposed four-star, 20-story-tall hotel located within the Delmarva Mall in Berlin, Worcester County, Maryland.** The hotel is being owned under the brand of IHG Hotels & Resorts, and has an area of about 3,000,000 square feet (280,000 m^(2)). To get there, guests must enter the Delmarva Mall at Basement 5 (if guests were on the first floor, they should travel down), and come through its main entrance to the lobby where the reception desks are located. The hotel features an upper lobby level for breakfast restaurant, offices, and a cafe, while amenities are located on the sixth floor which is the mall's first floor. In addition, there are 200+ rooms mixed with suites on each 14 floors, and an outdoor garden on the sixth floor as well.

Amenities on the sixth floor (mall's first floor) include a gymnasium, ballroom, a spa, an indoor swimming pool with jacuzzi, and saunas. Additionally, the Holiday Inn & Suites offers free Wi-Fi for guests with a strong signal. This hotel will be the top choosable option to stay at the Delmarva Mall in Ocean City, along with Holiday Inn & Suites Ocean City, attracting more than 300 guests per year even after the summer. The hotel is also connected to the first floor of the Delmarva Mall via another entrance to the third lobby level, which allow guests to travel down by elevators to the main lobby more easily and faster.

# Great Wolf Lodge Water Park | Ocean City

Great Wolf Lodge is a **proposed five-star, five-story resort hotel and indoor water park located near the Delmarva Mall in Berlin, Worcester County, Maryland.** Just 4 miles (6 km) southeast of Ocean City, the hotel has a total area of 930,000 square feet (86,000 m^(2)), and is accessible via the Gum Point Road from Maryland Route 589, which will expand into a two-lane road. It is owned and operated under the brand of Great Wolf Lodge, of which another location is in Perryville. This hotel will be the most choosable option to stay in Ocean City when approved and completed, alongside Kalahari Resorts & Convention Center and Camelbeach Resort. Additionally, it attracts 600+ guests every year even after the summer. Besides the indoor water park, the Great Wolf Lodge includes an outdoor water park with similar attractions and games. There are over 300 rooms on each floors of the hotel.

Amenities include a gymnasium, grand ballroom, arcade room, bowling hall, a breakfast restaurant, a cafe, a spa, saunas, indoor golf course, and a resort with an outdoor swimming pool. The hotel is also connected to the Delmarva Mall's northeast parking lot via an automated people mover (APM) from the northwest wing, allowing travelers to transfer between the mall and the hotel faster than driving and parking there. What's more, there are day passes for unregistered guests to visit Great Wolf Lodge water parks and stay within a day for a limited time. This serves as an alternative to Tropical World at the Delmarva Mall, if that indoor water park was to close temporarily due to several factors.

[Great Wolf Lodge logo used in Ocean City, Maryland](https://preview.redd.it/1a0f73z0a2ve1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=13952401bbe49dc2e4ceac017c5c0401f3cfee30)

# Kalahari Resorts & Convention Center - Ocean City

The Kalahari Resorts & Convention Center is a **proposed five-star, six-story indoor water park resort located in Berlin, Worcester County, Maryland,** near the Delmarva Mall. The hotel is being owned under the brand of Kahahari Resorts and Todd Nelson. Just about 8 miles (13 km) east-southeast of Ocean City, the total area covers 1,100,000 square feet (100,000 m^(2)) and consist of over 450 rooms mixed with suites. This will be the second most visited hotel to stay in Ocean City, after the Great Wolf Lodge and followed by Camelbeach Resort. Besides the indoor water park, amenities include saunas, a spa, a breakfast restaurant, a cafe, gymnasium, ballroom, an outdoor garden, and a resort with an outdoor swimming pool. The hotel will be accessible via the U.S. Route 50 (Ocean Gateway) interchange. Moreover, it attracts over 700 guests every year even after the summer.

There is a convention center located on the northwest wing of the hotel for promoting and sharing common interests. The Kalahari Resort is also connected to the Delmarva Mall's Tropical World indoor water park via an automated people mover (APM) across U.S. Route 113, allowing travelers to transfer between Tropical World and Kalahari Resort water parks. Furthermore, like the Great Wolf Lodge, the Kalahari Resort offer day passes for unregistered guests to visit the indoor water park, and stay there within a day for a limited time. This also makes Kalahari indoor water park an alternative to Tropical World in case that water park temporarily closes due to several factors.

[Kalahari Resort logo used in Ocean City, Maryland](https://preview.redd.it/yky6ozm0j2ve1.png?width=163&format=png&auto=webp&s=962243fd59cd412712f2884f060510a07dddf4b5)

# Camelbeach Resort

The Camelbeach Resort, located about 8 miles (13 km) southeast of Ocean City, is a **proposed five-star, five-story resort hotel and indoor water park in Berlin, Worcester County, Maryland.** The hotel covers a total area of 1,200,000 square feet (110,000 m^(2)), and it's owned under the brand of Camelbeach Resorts. This hotel is also located near the Delmarva Mall, although it doesn't include an automated people mover (APM) to connect with the mall. When approved and completed, the Camelbeach Resort is the third most choosable option to stay in Ocean City, after Kalahari Resorts & Convention Center and Great Wolf Lodge, attracting 600+ guests in the hotel per year. The hotel is only accessible from U.S. Route 113 and Maryland Route 589 through a bridge across the Church Branch.

Amenities are similar to the Great Wolf Lodge besides the indoor water park: a gymnasium, ballroom, a breakfast restaurant, a cafe, a bowling hall, saunas, a spa, an arcade room, and a resort with an outdoor swimming pool. From the Delmarva Mall, guests must drive to the Camelbeach Resort parking lots, as again the hotel is only accessible from U.S. Route 113 and Maryland Route 589, no automated people mover directly from the mall to the hotel. Just like the Kalahari Resorts and Great Wolf Lodge, this hotel can be purchased on day passes for unregistered guests to visit the water park. If the Tropical World at the Delmarva Mall temporarily closes due to several factors, the Camelbeach Resort remains as an alternative water park for tourists to opt.

# Nickeledeon Universe

Nickeledeon Universe is a **proposed indoor amusement park within the Delmarva Mall in Berlin, Worcester County, Maryland.** It is owned and operated by the Triple Five Group, which owns the Delmarva Mall too and other locations. The park has a total area covering 3,600,000 square feet (330,000 m^(2); 80 acres), and is considered the largest indoor amusement park in the United States. Nickeledeon Universe is also connected to the Holiday Inn & Suites via the back entrance to the third lobby level on the sixth floor (mall's first floor). The layout of the amusement park is designed with a tall atrium and a steel-supported ceiling above. Guidelines for Nickeledeon Universe can vary on each attractions to ensure safety for guests.

The Nickeledeon Universe consist of 10 mezzanine floors for restaurants, cafes, and shops. With this enormous height, it is also considered the world's tallest indoor amuesment park. Attractions and games are themed to the Nickeledeon's popular franchises, and is designed to be very similar to the one in the Mall of America (Bloomington, Minnesota). When approved and completed, the amusement park will attract approximately 6,000 people including tourists annually in and out of Maryland, even though after the summer. The Nickeledeon Universe is located about 6 miles (10 km) east of downtown Ocean City, and 20 miles west of Salisbury.

[The layout of the Nickeledeon Universe in the Delmarva Mall, designed to be similar to the Mall of America](https://preview.redd.it/8gfpv87pu2ve1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eeb291cc4099a1bbeaf37dc503000295b2e7d35e)

# Tropical World

Tropical World, also called Universal Volcano Bay 2, is a dub term for a **large 4,200,000-square-foot (390,000 m****^(2)****; 100-acre) indoor tropical-themed water park planned to be built within the Delmarva Mall in Berlin, Worcester County, Maryland.** It is located 7 miles (11 km) east of downtown Ocean City, and 20 miles west of Salisbury. When approved and completed, Tropical World will become the largest indoor water park in the United States and North America, surpassing the DreamWorks Water Park in American Dream Meadowlands. The water park is expected to attract approximately 1 million people including tourists annually.

However, if Tropical World – the American's largest indoor water park – was to close temporarily due to maintenance, technical issues, accidents, or other reasonable factors, then tourists will opt for three alternative water parks in resort hotels including Great Wolf Lodge, Kalahari Resorts & Convention Center, and Camelbeach Resort, by purchasing day passes.

Have you ever woken up and felt the gentle embrace of a day unfolding with grace? It's a magical feeling, isn't it? The idea of enjoying the day and letting it flow with grace is more than just a pleasant notion—it's a philosophy, a way of approaching life that can transform how we experience each moment.

Imagine this: you wake up in the morning, not rushed or anxious about what's ahead, but simply present. Maybe the sun is peeking through your curtains, casting a warm glow on your room. You take a deep breath, inhaling the freshness of a new day, and you feel a sense of peace settling within you. This is where it begins—this acceptance of the day as it comes, without resistance or expectation.

For me, learning to let the day flow with grace has been a journey of mindfulness and appreciation. It's about finding beauty in the smallest of things: the laughter of children playing outside my kindergarten classroom, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, or the soothing rhythm of rain tapping against my window. These moments, when savored and embraced, become anchors of peace in a busy world.

But embracing the day doesn't mean avoiding challenges or setbacks. Life is a blend of sunny mornings and stormy afternoons. It's in these moments of challenge that the philosophy of grace truly shines. It's about navigating difficulties with resilience and compassion, understanding that every experience—pleasant or challenging—is an opportunity for growth and learning.

Think about how you approach your daily interactions and tasks. When we approach them with grace—being kind to ourselves and others, maintaining patience even when things don't go as planned—we create a ripple effect of positivity. It's like dropping a pebble into a pond; the effects of our gracefulness spread outward, touching lives in ways we may never fully realize.

Moreover, enjoying the day and letting it flow with grace isn't just a personal philosophy; it can also be a communal practice. When we cultivate an atmosphere of grace in our relationships and communities, we foster understanding and harmony. We become agents of peace, contributing to a collective sense of well-being and connection.

In essence, embracing each day with grace is about mindfulness, resilience, and cultivating a positive outlook. It's about finding joy in the present moment and appreciating the richness of life's experiences. So, the next time you wake up to a new day, remember: embrace it, enjoy it, and let it flow with grace.

## What is Tradenex Maven?

Tradenex Maven is an **automated trading platform** designed to make trading accessible for people who don’t want to spend hours analyzing markets. Think of it as a smart assistant that does the heavy lifting — it scans the market, finds potential trades, and executes them based on pre-set algorithms.

The platform is geared towards **cryptocurrency** and **forex trading**, but it also supports other popular markets like stocks and commodities. It uses automation to help users take advantage of market opportunities in real-time, even if they’re asleep or busy with day jobs.

In short, it's a tool that combines **AI-driven tech** with a clean user interface to help you trade smarter, not harder.

## Who Created Tradenex Maven?

Tradenex Maven doesn’t make a big fuss about who’s behind it, which is kind of annoying, but also common with platforms like this. It’s likely developed by a group of fintech professionals or trading enthusiasts who’ve worked on similar platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**.

While the lack of transparency on the founders might raise an eyebrow, it's not necessarily a red flag. Many trading platforms choose to focus on the product rather than the personalities behind it. That said, I’d love to see more public-facing info in the future to build more trust.

## How Does Tradenex Maven Work?

At its core, Tradenex Maven works using **automated trading algorithms**. These algorithms constantly scan the market to identify potential buy or sell opportunities based on real-time data.

Here’s a basic breakdown of how it works:

- You sign up and fund your account.
- The system gives you access to a dashboard where you can customize settings.
- Tradenex Maven then begins analyzing market trends and executing trades on your behalf.
- You can either let it run fully automated or choose to intervene manually.

It’s designed to minimize emotional trading and take advantage of market volatility — which is perfect for crypto markets that move 24/7.

## Tradenex Maven Pros and Cons

Like any platform, there’s a mix of good and not-so-good. Here’s a quick breakdown:

Tradenex Maven is web-based, which means you can access it on pretty much any device with a browser. I tested it on:

- **Desktop browsers** (Chrome and Firefox) – smooth performance.
- **Smartphones** – works well on Safari and Chrome mobile.
- **Tablets** – no issues there either.

While there’s no dedicated mobile app yet, the **responsive design** makes it easy to trade on the go. Just bookmark the site and you’re good.

## Tradenex Maven – Supported Countries

Tradenex Maven is available in most regions, including:

- United States
- Canada
- Australia
- United Kingdom
- Most of Europe
- South Africa
- Southeast Asia

However, it’s **not available** in a few **restricted countries** like North Korea and some parts of the Middle East due to regulatory reasons. If you’re unsure, just try signing up — it’ll tell you if your country is supported.

## Tradenex Maven – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where Tradenex Maven shines. The platform uses **AI-driven algorithms** to process massive amounts of market data in real-time. That means it can **spot trading opportunities way faster** than the average human.

The data is refreshed constantly, and the bot adapts its strategy based on current market movements — which is crucial in fast-moving markets like crypto.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and **not overloaded with charts or jargon**. Whether you're a complete beginner or someone who’s used other trading tools, you’ll find your way around quickly.

I appreciated the simple layout — no unnecessary tabs, just straightforward buttons and sliders to tweak your strategy.

### Mobile Accessibility

Even though there’s no official app, Tradenex Maven is fully optimized for mobile. I tested it on both Android and iPhone, and it worked fine. You can **check your stats, update settings, or pause trading** while waiting for your coffee.

It feels like having a pocket-sized trading assistant.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **alerts for price changes, trade actions, or account performance**. If you don’t want the bot to go full-auto, you can use it as a signal tool and act manually when you get notified.

Great for control freaks (like me) who still want a bit of automation.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Tradenex Maven isn’t just for crypto. You can trade **forex, commodities, and even stocks**, depending on your preferences. That’s a big plus if you want to diversify or try out different markets without switching platforms.

## Is Tradenex Maven a Scam?

The key green flags:

- SSL secure website
- Verified brokers

Just remember to **start small**, use the demo account, and don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.

That $250 goes straight into your trading account — it’s not a fee. You can use it to test the waters with the bot or explore manual trading if that’s more your style.

### Tradenex Maven Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7** through email and live chat. I tested the live chat at around 11 PM my time and got a response within 5 minutes, which was a nice surprise.

They also provide a **help center** with FAQs and basic guides. While it’s not the most detailed knowledge hub, it’s enough to get you started.

## How do you start trading on Tradenex Maven?

***Talia, domestic human***

*December 3rd, Earth year 2103*

Sprinting away from animal control for as long as my tired legs would allow, I continued in the direction indicated by my benefactor’s device. My left wrist throbbed with intense pain only dampened by the cocktail of adrenaline and sheer willpower coursing through my veins. I had awoken less than an hour before, and already I felt like collapsing once again. 

My whole body trembled with exertion as I turned yet another corner, praying to gods I didn’t believe in that nobody was waiting for me up ahead. With one wrist dislocated, I had to make an agonizing decision to pocket the gun so that I could access my ally’s directions at the cost of going unarmed. Sweat dripping down my brow threatened to blind me as for a moment I collapsed against the comfortingly-cold metal body of a dumpster, momentarily setting down the device to nurse my injured hand. 

Suddenly, the screen displaying my destination lit up with a message. *“Don’t stop now!”* It demanded. *“You’re just three blocks away. I won’t be able to disrupt the satellite system for much longer.”*

Searching within myself for just a few more droplets of strength, I struggled to my feet and all-but-limped the final few blocks. Out in the open streets, xeno citizens were going about their lives, blissfully free of the pain and fear that dominated my mind.

The warehouse marked as my destination looked on the outside like it hadn’t been used in years. Its corrugated walls, streaked with rust, presented a mosaic of decay and abandonment. Once-vibrant paint peeled away in long, curling strips that partially obscured the alien glyphs marking its loading bay. Weeds pushed through cracks in the surrounding pavement in quiet defiance of the industrial relic. To me, however, it may as well have been a palace made of gold.

Hope renewed a sliver of my strength as I dashed forth and wrapped the fingers of my still-functional hand around the rusty back door’s handle, beaming with joy as it gave way with a light yank. Stepping into the warehouse’s almost pitch-darkness, I sighed with pleasure as the cold air inside kissed my sweat-slicked skin, distracting me for a few blissful moments from the last day’s nightmarish occurrences. With the door closed behind me, I saw a thin strip of bluish light reaching out to me from a cracked door.

Hesitance tempered my every step as I crept toward the light and peered into the sizable room illuminated by it. Judging by its dust-caked desks and long out of date computers, this was a reception area of some sort. A television screen hooked up to the wall fizzled with silent static as it overlooked a low-set coffee table bearing five vials of a silvery liquid.

*“Congratulations, Talia!”* The television beamed, startling me as I dropped my device and fumbled desperately for Prochur’s gun. *“There’s no need for that…”* it continued as the static cleared to reveal a geometric pattern that moved as it spoke. *“I’m the one who’s been guiding you this whole time.”*

Picking up the device I’d dropped onto the ground, I took a moment to confirm this. *“R U talking 2 me thru TV rite now?”*

In response, a single word popped up on screen. *“Yes.”*

Relief flooded my mind as I took a moment to recollect myself before looking up at the television and speaking up. “Why aren’t you here in person?” I asked, refusing to let my guard down just yet. 

*“That is complicated,”* replied the television, its response not exactly as comforting as I had hoped. *“For now, we need to get your tracker disabled.”*

“And how exactly are we going to do that? I don’t see doctors or surgery bays around here.”

Behind me, one of the old computer screens lit up with a notification, partially illuminating an old filing cabinet. *“The key to the cabinet is under that computer’s keyboard. Use it to unlock the second cabinet drawer from the top.”* Instructed my benefactor, remaining deliberately enigmatic.

With no choice but to obey, I carefully crept over to the computer and lifted its keyboard to reveal a simple, unassuming key. Then, with only slight hesitation, I slotted it into the second cabinet from the top and opened it up to look inside. “Is this…” I picked up the strange chrome device shaped almost like a staple gun. It reminded me of something my vet would use. “Is this an auto-syringe?”

*“Correct,”* replied the television as the geometric icon was replaced by a simple diagram on how to insert a vial into this device. *“Now: you see those vials on the coffee table? Grab one and load it into the syringe, then inject it into your neck.”*

“In my neck?” I repeated incredulously, eyeing the screen with newfound suspicion. “Why would I do that?”

*“It is the most efficient path to your subcutaneous implant. You have approximately thirty minutes until the satellite link is restored and this location is compromised.”* Continued my benefactor, their tone a curious mix of casual and robotic.

Picking up the auto-syringe with my good hand, I cautiously approached the table and set it down there before picking up one of the vials and surveying it. “I'm sorry, but I can’t inject this stuff unless you tell me what it is!”

For the first time since I’d come into contact with my benefactor, they actually took a moment to respond. *“The vial you are holding contains a population of programmable medical nanites. Once you inject them, they will rapidly bypass the blood-brain barrier and I will be able to use them to disable your tracker.”*

Eyeing the small glass vessel of silvery liquid, I felt a lump forming in my throat. Horrific as the procedure Prochur would force me to undergo was, at least I knew what its result would be. This vial, however, presented an unknown quantity. My escape up to this point had been painful and terrifying, but at least then I wielded some sliver of self-determination. Even if these really were nanites, what they would do to me was entirely up to the one controlling them. Now, once again, I was placing my fate in the hands of another.

*Is this how I die?* I wondered, awkwardly loading the auto-syringe and holding it to the side of my neck. If this was a sedative, I’d be at the mercy of my ‘benefactor’. If it was poison, I’d be dead in minutes. My finger quivered as I began to tighten it around the trigger, fighting my self-preservation instincts for every millimeter of movement.

I didn’t feel the needle go in. There was a puff of air, and after a few seconds of nothing else, I took the syringe off of my neck and felt a droplet of blood trickling down from where I had held it. “There…” I sighed, slapping the instrument down onto the coffee table before looking back up at the television screen. “I injected it… What now?”

*“Take a seat and try to relax,”* answered the television in a command I was more than happy to follow, collapsing onto a nearby chair with a sigh of mild relief. *“We are still waiting on someone.”*

Hearing this, I felt a lump of anxiety forming in my throat, momentarily rendering me as speechless as Prochur’s implant had. “Who else is coming?” I asked, trying and failing to conceal my mounting concern. 

*“You are not the only runaway I sought to enlist,”* replied my enigmatic ally, pulling up a series of images on the television screen depicting my face alongside those of four other humans, each one accompanied by basic information regarding them. *“Each vile on that table was intended for one of these runaways…”* Following this explanation, three of the profiles faded away, leaving behind only mine and one other. *“Unfortunately, three of my selections have already been recaptured. That leaves just you and Enzo—who is currently two blocks away from our position.”*

The profile beside my own was of a young man roughly my own age. Judging by the sterile white background that matched mine, his picture had also come from a veterinary clinic. Behind locks of wavy blonde hair, Enzo’s eyes like pools of chocolate pierced through the screen as though he was staring right at me. 

Shaking off the bizarre sensation crawling up my spine, I held my damaged wrist in my hand and momentarily attempted to correct it, stopping almost immediately as agonizing pain lanced up my arm in reply. *“Do not attempt that,”* the screen crackled. *“You will not be able to reset your wrist without assistance from another sapient. Once Enzo arrives, he will assist you in correcting the injury.”*

“You never told me your name…” I interrupted, looking upon the geometric pattern with something between curiosity and suspicion. “Now would be a good time.”

*“My name is… Difficult for most sapients to pronounce,”* continued my benefactor, their geometric avatar shifting and pulsating as though lost in thought. *“You may call me ‘Dovetail’.”*

Given the secretive nature of my benefactor up to this point, a nickname seemed like the closest thing to an actual answer I was going to get, so I decided not to push the issue. Reaching into my froggy-face backpack, I retrieved my water bottle and a handful of jerky, eating just enough so that my stomach would stop growling at me.

In the next room over, I heard the same rusty door I had come in through opening once more. “Hello?” A voice called out in English, the sound of their footsteps echoing across the floor towards me.

“In here,” I practically whispered, just barely loud enough for the fellow runaway to hear. For a moment, the footsteps ceased; then, they sped up.

Watching as Enzo walked in, I felt a sudden surge of self-consciousness wash over me. I didn’t get to interact with other humans often, and peering into the dark television screen at my reflection, the girl staring back at me seemed like she’d make a poor first impression. Her hair mussed by recent sleep combined with clothes that assuredly smelled of sweat created an aesthetic less of ‘badass rebel’ and more ‘scraggly goblin’.

*“Welcome, Enzo!”* Chimed Dovetail, their robotic tone tinted with satisfaction. Though not as pristine as he appeared on his profile, Enzo’s escape had clearly gone much smoother than mine judging by his relatively clean clothes and lack of visible injuries. *“Congratulations on making it here! You are one of two to have successfully reached this place.”*

“I, uh… I see that,” Enzo panted, regarding me with a bizarre mixture of pity and suspicion. “What’s your name?” He asked, keeping an arm’s length away from me as he circled the coffee table and took a seat on its other side.

Raising the water bottle to my lips and taking a long swig, I noticed a flicker of longing appear in the other stray’s eyes. The vessel I’d been drinking from only had a few gulps left, and I had planned to savor them. Empathy, however, prevailed as I held out the bottle to Enzo. “My name’s Talia,” I smiled, trying not to let him see how much it hurt me to give up the rest of my supply. “Looks like we’re the only two who made it.”

*“Enzo: on the table in front of you are four vials of nanites. Please use the auto-syringe to inject one of said vials,”* commanded Dovetail just as the other stray finished draining what was left of our water. For a moment, he seemed hesitant, but a reminder from our benefactor of the tracking device broadcasting our location was sufficient motivation. 

Loading the nanite vial with clinical precision, Enzo held it to his neck and without further delay pressed down on the trigger, eliciting another puff of air from the syringe as it pumped the liquid into him. With that done, the human turned his gaze toward me. “Holy shit: your wrist!” He half-gasped, reaching out for my arm only to stop short of grabbing it. “What happened?”

“I… Might have tried to fire a Jakuvian-grade pistol one-handed,” I sighed, deciding it best to simplify my explanation. “Dovetail says you can help me reset it.”

“Oh, that’s easy,” replied the stray, gently wrapping his hand around my limp wrist. “You’ll wanna bite down on something: this is gonna hurt like a bitch.” 

Taking his advice, I placed one of the straps of my backpack between my teeth and clamped down hard onto it. “On the count of three, okay Talia? One… Two—” he didn’t wait for ‘three’ before yanking the bone back into its original position with a sickening *crrrack* accompanied by a roaring agony worse than what I’d felt incurring the injury. I wanted to cry out, to scream, to swear, but we couldn’t risk anyone outside hearing it. Instead, I remained silent as the pain slowly but surely faded to a manageable level. 

*“Excellent!”* Dovetail chimed in, their voice partially muddled by the pain I was in. *“Your nanites will take care of the rest.”*

“So your name is Dovetail?” Enzo asked, looking at our benefactor with a curious expression. “Not to sound ungrateful, but I have some questions regarding whatever the hell is happening here. For one thing, what’s the plan? I’m guessing you wanna try and sway the Council. The vote for Human independence was decently close—maybe we can get them to reconvene on it?”

*“Unfortunately, I do not believe that is an option…”* Answered Dovetail with an enigmatic lilt. *“You see, the Council’s vote was not merely on whether they should deem Humanity sapient—it was a vote to change the definition of sapience itself so that Humans could be included under it.”*

Oddly pedantic as it was, Dovetail’s explanation gave no clear reason as to why a recount was out of the question. “Even still…” I replied, picking up where Enzo left off. “The vote *was* close. If we can get them to recount, maybe things might go different.”

*“The vote they showed the public was close…”* our benefactor replied, their geometric avatar onscreen replaced by a pie chart representing the Council’s votes. *“Sixty in favor, seventy-nine opposed, and three abstaining. However, when I accessed the voting database with ‘borrowed’ Council privileges, the vote looked something like this—”* Immediately, the chart began to shift as the red ‘opposed’ section seemed to swallow up the blue ‘in favor’ one. *“Eight in favor, seven abstaining, one hundred and twenty seven opposed.”*",20,1744770369.0,HFY,8,1.0,False

1k09pkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1k09pkw/im_ready_to_finish_it/,I'm ready to finish it,"I started watching twin peaks in 2016 and I instantly fell in love. This is a story unlike any other. I love how it is so over-the-top silly, surreal in it's symbolism, cozy in a small town kind of way, and a dichotomy of tenderness and brutality. I quickly went through the first and second season while I was with my college girlfriend. We watched the movie together and it just blew my mind. Shortly after, they announced the release of season 3. I couldn't believe it. I counted the days for the release and when the time finally came, I didn't watch it. I couldn't watch it. I was scared. I thought to myself, ""If I finish this show, it will actually be the end."" 

I watched the show again in 2021 and I finished the movie. Once again, I couldn't bring myself to watch the 3rd season. Ive done this in different ways throughout my life. One of my all time favorite shows is  Parts Unknown with Anthony Bourdain. I had watched all the episodes. But when I landed on the last season, I couldn't bring myself to do it. Bourdain and Lynch are no longer on this plane and this would truly be the end. I find comfort in knowing that there are still episodes both for Twin Peaks and Parts Unknown that are still untouched, waiting for a random Tuesday night for me to gently take in an episode I have yet to see.

At times I feel silly thinking this way over tv shows. But truthfully I dont get like this for other shows. I can finish them just fine. I think the difference is that people like Lynch and Bourdain are people that I respected so much on their own regarding their life philosophy outside of tv. 

I don't have a traumatic history with grief,  just a complicated relationship to it. I felt this in past relationships where I have struggled to let go. The idea of the end is unsettling and a part of me can't comprehend it. I know I'll be fine, I know that part of it is just a matter of getting through it. Still, I struggle. 

But I don't want to keep feeling like this. Part of getting better with this is to recognize that I'll get better at it by simply doing it. I recently finished season 1, 2 and FWWM and I've decided that I want to invite my friend over to watch the last season together. He loves the show so much so it would feel appropriate to finish it with him. I may even swing by Bob's Big Boy and get a slice of cherry pie and black coffee. It feels more right this time and I'd feel happy to finally be in the same level of confusion as everyone else after I've watched season 3 lol.

1k09oz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitCrewNicotine/comments/1k09oz6/the_most_common_quitting_mistakes/,The most common quitting mistakes,"Quitting nicotine is one of the hardest things you can do, and most people make it even harder on themselves without realizing it. If you've tried to quit and slipped up, or if you're planning to quit and want to be prepared, this is for you.

These are the mistakes I see over and over. Avoiding them won’t make quitting easy, but it will make it possible.

**1. Telling yourself “just one won’t hurt”**  
This is the biggest trap. That one turns into a full relapse faster than you think. If you're quitting, you have to go all in. No exceptions, no gray areas.

**2. Not having a real plan**  
Deciding to quit is great, but if you don't have a strategy, you're relying on willpower alone. And willpower runs out. Know your quit date, know what your triggers are, and have a plan for what to do when cravings hit.

**3. Thinking motivation will carry you**  
Motivation comes and goes. Some days you'll feel fired up, but other days you'll want to cave. That's normal. Quitting requires structure, not just good intentions. Routine, accountability, and backup strategies are what keep you going when the motivation disappears.

**4. Keeping your routine exactly the same**  
If you always smoked or vaped during certain parts of your day, like your morning coffee, after meals, or when driving, those triggers will hit hard. If you don’t change your routine, you’ll keep walking right into cravings. Even small changes help. Switch your drink, take a different route, change your schedule slightly.

**5. Not preparing for withdrawal**  
If you're surprised by how bad withdrawal feels, you're more likely to relapse just to make it stop. It's not a sign that you're weak. It's literally your brain and body adjusting to life without nicotine. Expect the headaches, brain fog, irritability. Know that it passes. You’re not broken, you’re healing.

**6. Trying to do it alone**  
Some people think they can white knuckle it by themselves. It usually doesn’t work. You need people around you who understand what you’re going through. Having others in your corner makes a huge difference.

**7. Thinking a relapse means you failed**  
People mess up. It happens. But a relapse doesn't have to mean you're back at square one. The real mistake is giving up completely after a slip. The faster you get back on track, the more likely you are to stay quit for good. Learn from it and move forward.

1k09ncr,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k09ncr/the_hierarchy_of_employment_and_how_ai_affects/,The hierarchy of employment and how AI affects your job,"**tldr;** my 2¢ on how to think about AI with respect to job security - own projects, not tasks

**Background:** I'm a senior software engineer with 7 years of experience, including fintech, big tech, and early-stage startups. I'm currently bootstrapping a lifestyle-sized small software product for SMBs. 

**Point of this post:** I'm giving my two cents about how to think of your career in software and whether it is at risk from AI.

**Part 1: the hierarchy of employment**

I think of all jobs, including in software, as falling into three categories:

1. Task-oriented: your day-to-day revolves around completing tasks assigned to you. If you're working at a cafe, that might mean ""clean the tables"" or ""make coffee."" If you're a SWE, that might mean ""change the button color palette from blues to purples according to the design system."" Being good at this means you're known for clearing Jira queues quickly and nobody has to clean up after you or redo work you said you did.
2. Project-oriented: you're given projects to complete but the details and methods are up to you. If you're working at a cafe, it could be ""make sure the pastries are refreshed every two hours."" If you're a software engineer, it could be ""implement the new design system."" Being good at this means you can be trusted to deliver a feature that may have multiple ways of completing it while balancing trade-offs, on time. This often requires delegation. I'm at this level right now.
3. Outcome-oriented: you own an outcome. That's often quantified in terms of money or a money-adjacent metric. If you're at a cafe, it can be increasing the number of baked goods sold with coffee orders. If you're in software (you may not be actively coding at this level), it may be ""increase conversions from large enterprise clients on the landing page."" Being good at this means being known as someone who can make products grow revenue and/or profit. I'm upgrading to this level by bootstrapping a business - even if I fail, I will have owned an outcome.

In both coffee and software examples, notice that these are different roles on the same project. Notice also that I focus on ""being known as,"" which is the most important thing in career stability and progression.

Almost everyone typically starts on level 1. It's unusual and incredibly risky to stay at level 1, and you have to be constantly adapting and learning new technologies to pull it off. You want to graduate to level 2 as soon as possible**,** ideally within 2 years. Few people make it to level 3, it's normally OK to stay at level 2. Level 2 makes more than level 1 within the same company/skillset (of course a PM at Walmart might make less than an AI engineer at OpenAI). Level 3 has unbounded pay. 

**How to move levels**

I am by no means a great authority on getting promoted, I tend to get distracted and chase my own goals. But from talking to people who are good at it, there are two things you need to do:

1. Be really good at your current job band: if you're level 1, your manager knows that when they give you a task, it will be done when you say it will be done, it will be done to the highest reasonable standards, and nobody is going to have to clean up after you.
2. Know your manager's goals and align your work to them. Find ways to make them look better and achieve their goals. Show you care.

Of course, there are more cynical factors, like being liked and having a good attitude. Finally, your self-conception is important. If you think of yourself as ""a guy who makes Spring Boot apps"" you'll be stuck in level 1 longer than if you think of yourself as ""a guy who delivers backend services."" PG has a great essay about keeping your self-characterization loose but I can't find it right now.

  
**Part 2: What AI means for you**

AI is decently good at doing a lot of level 1 work. If you counted on being the gatekeeper of button colors as the reason for why you can't be fired, that's not going to work anymore. In fact, if you counted on being the gatekeeper of anything, that's unlikely to keep working. 

That being said, level 1 is always risky. If you were a really good JQuery developer who could complete any task in that language, the rise of frameworks like React threatened your job. Not right away as your company might need you for their existing code, but the reduced demand for JQuery devs would lessen your bargaining power and the increased support and flood of React developers would make switching stacks increasingly attractive to your employer. Any major technology shift is a threat to level 1 operators.

The difference with AI, however, is that it's happening across all technologies at once. The goal is what's being automated, not just the method. AI can write basic software in any language. You can't switch from owning button colors in JQuery to owning button colors in React or whatever the next tech is, you have to upgrade what you can deliver.

There are tasks that AI can't do because it's not smart enough. If you're a staff engineer working on very complex problems you might be fine, but if you're part of the 90% that do various versions of the same thing that everyone else does, your job is at risk once the Devins of the world nail their product and user experience.

The good news is that it's also a resource that you can use:

1. If you're currently task-oriented, use AI to be really good at completing tasks fast and well. Do this by focusing on the ""well."" AI is already really fast compared to you, so don't try to go faster. Plan first, think what kind of testing you need, both automated and manual, and what the deployment story will look like
2. Now that you know the hierarchy of employment, focus on graduating to the next band by understanding the context in which you're given tasks, talking to your lead, and making their project happen faster and better

**Why AI is not a threat to bands 2 and 3**

Owning a project requires taste. AI doesn't have taste yet, and I doubt it will develop it. The main difference between owning tasks and owning a project is thinking through tradeoffs, understanding how this project fits and what its goals are, and making a plan that aligns the tradeoffs with the goals. AI can be very helpful as an assistant in doing this, but it requires the person doing it to already know what the options are and what the goals are. This is not the case for basic feature development.

Level 3 is safe first because it's the decision makers who aren't going to fire themselves, and second because it requires even more intuition and experience than AI has access to. More importantly, it requires accountability, which is one of the main barriers to using AI.",4,1744770030.0,cscareerquestions,1,0.75,False

ACT I: THE REQUIEM

EXT. MOUNT WUNDAGORE - NIGHT

A storm churns violently overhead. Crimson lightning arcs across the clouds. The mountain groans—loud, alive, almost in pain.

INT. MOUNT WUNDAGORE - THRESHOLD CHAMBER - NIGHT

CLOSE ON - STONE WALLS

Hairline fractures snake across the glyph-covered walls. The ancient rock groans, crumbles.

SFX: A low, growing RUMBLE builds into a metallic wail.

Chunks of stone begin to FALL.

CUT TO - WANDA MAXIMOFF

She stands alone at the center, dust in her hair, eyes red-rimmed—not from power, from fear.

Her breath is shallow. Rapid.

She looks up—

CRACK—another slab crashes down behind her.

CLOSE ON - HER HANDS

They lift, instinctively. Not casting. Not summoning.

Just shielding. 

A human reflex.

WIDE SHOT - THE CHAMBER

The ceiling gives. Stone crashes downward.

Wanda—no longer glowing, no longer godlike—curls inward.

She doesn’t run.

She doesn’t fight.

She just braces.

CUT TO - EXT. MOUNT WUNDAGORE - NIGHT

From the outside, the mountain’s peak implodes inward—a violent collapse. Dust clouds mushroom outward.

SILENCE.

Then—

A SCREAM.

SFX: A high-pitched, wraith-like SHRIEK—layered with a very real, very human scream.

It doesn’t come from Wanda’s mouth. 

It comes from the impact point.

WIDE - THE MOUNTAIN’S FACE

RED AND BLACK MAGIC blasts out in opposite directions—violent, unnatural, like energy being rejected by the earth.

The sound is unbearable. It shreds the silence, echoes through the valley.

Then—

STILLNESS.

Only dust now.

Only ruin.

CLOSE ON - THE COLLAPSE SITE

A single tendril of smoke-red energy flickers briefly from beneath the rubble.

It quivers.

Then slithers back under.

BLACK SCREEN.

FAINT SFX:

A breath. Small. Sharp. Not Wanda’s.

New.

FADE OUT.

TEXT ON SCREEN: “Six Months Later.”

SFX: Faint echoes—newscasters overlapping, distorted.

“Where is she?”

“…the mountain collapse…”

“…no sign of the body…”

“…no official Avengers roster since—”

FADE IN:

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM – DAY

A civics teacher stands in front of a flickering screen. The slide reads:

""THE SOKOVIA ACCORDS: REPEALED OR REWRITTEN?""

Students barely pay attention. One slouches with earbuds in. Another scrolls her phone.

STUDENT

So... like... what happens if someone with laser eyes

blows up a building now?

TEACHER

The Global Repatriation Council is working on updated legislation.

A pause.

STUDENT #2

What happened to the Avengers?

The teacher falters.

The screen shifts to a faded image of the original team. Static ripples across their faces.

FLASHBACK - AVENGERS COMPOUND

INT. VISION’S ROOM – NIGHT

The room is quiet. Too quiet.

Only the soft pacing of Vision—gliding across the floor in deliberate steps.

Hands clasped behind his back. Posture perfect.

But his shoulders are tight. His jaw clenched.

The synthetic jewel in his forehead flickers—nervous energy.

A single screen floats beside him.

Equations shift and reconfigure: quantum loop theories, entropy paradoxes.

He stares, but his eyes are somewhere else.

VISION

“If particle spin could destabilize probability long enough to recalibrate phase transitions, perhaps—”

He stops.

Mid-thought.

Her face flashes behind his eyes.

⸻

FLASH – WANDA LAUGHING

Bathed in golden kitchen light.

Hair falling across her eyes—she brushes it back.

An oversized sweater slips off her shoulder.

Vision swallows.

⸻

He turns away sharply, like he can physically outrun the memory.

The screen reshapes—layering on another theory.

More complexity. More noise.

But the thoughts keep coming.

Wanda, leaning over the sink.

Her sleeves rolled up.

The sound of her voice saying his name in that unguarded, low tone.

The thought of—

kissing her.

⸻

He closes his eyes.

Inhales.

VISION

“It is illogical. It is… intrusive. It is—”

He stops again.

His hand drifts to his chest.

Where a heartbeat should live.

He doesn’t understand it. Not fully.

But when he thinks of her…

There’s a pull.

A heat.

A yearning.

Something beyond data.

Beyond circuitry.

Something human.

⸻

He sits on the edge of his bed.

Still. Silent.

The glow of unsolved equations flickers beside him.

But all he can see is the way Wanda looked at him earlier—

Not like Jarvis.

Not like a weapon.

Not like a machine.

But like a man.

Like he was seen.

⸻

VISION

“I wish to comfort her.

To understand her pain.

But I also…

I wish to hold her.”

He opens his eyes—soft, wide, almost afraid.

VISION

“I wish… to be held in return.”

The screen fades to black.

He lets it.

Because tonight, no equation will soothe the ache in his chest.

Only she could do that.

And maybe tomorrow—

He’ll try.

He’ll make her chicken paprikash.

But tonight—

He sits in the quiet.

Longing for a girl with chaos in her bones,

and kindness in her smile.

⸻

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND – COMMON ROOM – NIGHT

Soft light flickers from the screen—blues and grays washing over the room.

WANDA is curled up on the couch. Blanket cocoon. Eyes glassy—not from the movie.

The Notebook plays softly. Rain. Kissing. Heartbreak.

Background noise to the storm she’s holding in.

A gentle knock on the doorframe.

She looks up.

VISION stands there.

Arms at his sides. Slightly awkward. Almost… shy.

VISION

“Forgive the interruption. I… found Euler’s conjecture unexpectedly complex tonight. I wondered if you—”

(beat)

“—might like some company.”

Wanda blinks.

Euler’s conjecture?

Her heart does something it shouldn’t.

She pats the cushion beside her.

WANDA

“Sure. Unless you’re worried Ryan Gosling’s emotional arc will prove equally… complex.”

A soft hum escapes Vision. Not quite a laugh.

More like relieved amusement.

He enters.

Pauses.

Looks at her.

Looks at the couch.

Then—sits.

Tentative. Upright. Respectful.

Like she’s royalty.

Wanda shifts. Tries to refocus on the movie.

Fails.

Her pulse is loud.

⸻

A beat later—

NATASHA walks past the open door. Stops.

She glances at the two of them—too close to be casual, too stiff to be comfortable.

Raises an eyebrow.

NATASHA

(dry)

“Huh.”

She smirks. Walks away.

Wanda stifles a laugh.

Vision stares forward like the screen might swallow him.

⸻

Time passes.

Scene after scene—they drift.

Inch by inch.

Shoulders almost touch. Then—

They do.

Wanda leans in, barely.

She feels him. Warm.

Too warm for synthetic parts.

WANDA

“You must be freezing.”

(beat)

“Come on… share the blanket.”

Vision looks at the blanket like it’s radioactive.

VISION

“I… am not certain I can feel cold in the traditional sense, but—”

WANDA

(teasing)

“But?”

He looks at her.

Really looks.

Her smile.

Her eyes.

The way her voice softens when she’s teasing him.

He swallows.

(Why? He doesn’t need to. But something in his design mimics the human response to overwhelming emotion.)

VISION

(softly)

“Perhaps… I could benefit from a degree of warmth.”

He pulls the blanket over them.

Their shoulders touch.

Then thighs.

Then—

nothing else exists.

⸻

He catches the scent of her hair.

She glances at his lips.

Both aching.

Neither ready.

But closer now.

Always closer.

⸻The movie hits that scene.

Rain. Desperation. The lovers collide—devouring each other.

Suddenly—

Wanda and Vision aren’t watching the movie.

The movie is watching them.

⸻

She leans against him now.

Head on his shoulder. Body relaxed.

But her breathing?

Shallow.

Fast.

Rising.

Her neckline shifts under the blanket.

Her skin, pink and glowing in the light.

Vision doesn’t turn his head.

But he knows.

He shifts in his seat.

Reaches for a nearby pillow.

Quick. Strategic.

But not quick enough.

Wanda notices.

⸻

She says nothing.

Just keeps breathing.

Soft. Heavy.

Vision feels each breath like it’s his own.

Sees her collarbone rise and fall.

The flutter in her throat.

The pulse that jumps when his arm brushes hers.

He’s aching.

And for the first time—he doesn’t want it to stop.

⸻

Her fingers graze his knee beneath the blanket.

On-screen—sounds of ecstasy, gasps, skin meeting skin.

In the silence between them—

only tension.

⸻

Vision stares at the screen like a lifeline.

But his processors are failing him.

They stay like that.

No words.

Because the spell might break.

And neither is ready for that.

The movie ends.

Credits roll in soft piano and rain.

The room is silver and shadow.

Still. Electric.

His arm—now behind her on the couch.

Not touching.

But near.

⸻

Wanda blinks slowly.

She’s not watching the screen.

She’s listening—

To the hum in his chest.

To the stillness.

She turns slightly.

Looks up.

He’s already looking at her.

⸻

Their eyes meet.

This time—

Neither looks away.

⸻

WANDA

(soft)

“You stayed.”

VISION

(barely audible)

“I didn’t want to go.”

A beat.

The air, thick. Charged.

Like a wire pulled tight.

⸻

WANDA

(gentle, small smile)

“You never said if the conjecture got any easier.”

VISION

(soft, honest)

“It did not.”

Their eyes lock.WANDA

(smirking)

I sense your mind analyzing me. Go on then. Analyze me.

VISION

(polite, curious)

In what sense?

WANDA

Emotionally. Psychologically. Whatever your circuits do.

(beat)

I can take it.

VISION

Very well.

(beat, straight-faced)

Your breathing is shallow — approximately seventeen breaths per minute.

Heart rate elevated — 112 bpm. Likely due to proximity.

Pupils dilated. Indicating either low light or… heightened— 

WANDA Ok, ok. I think we get it.She laughs playfully. Then suddenly–

Her gaze drops.

To his lips.

His jaw.

Back to his eyes.

She swallows.

He blinks once. Then again.

⸻

VISION

(softly)

“Wanda…”

Her name leaves him like a prayer.

And in that moment—

He doesn’t move.

But something shatters in his expression.

So full of longing.

Fear.

Reverence.

Wanda forgets how to breathe.

⸻

She shifts closer. Slowly.

With purpose.

Her fingers trail down his arm.

Find his hand.

Lace with his.

He looks down.

Like he can’t believe it’s real.

⸻

WANDA

(quiet)

“I don’t know what this is yet.”

VISION

(bare breath)

“Nor do I.”

She leans against him again.

This time—

He leans into her.

Lets his head rest against hers.

Lets his fingers tighten slightly around hers.

And in that hush—

that heartbeat neither of them should have—

they sit.

Not as witch and android.

Not as weapon and machine.

But as two souls choosing the ache.

Choosing the stillness.

Choosing each other.

⸻

EXT. BARTON FAMILY FARM – EARLY MORNING

The world is quiet.

The Barton home glows warm—filled with the smell of breakfast, the sound of laughter.

LILA and COOPER argue playfully at the kitchen table.

LAURA kisses CLINT on the cheek, smiling.

CLINT watches them, coffee in hand.

But… he’s not really there.

FLASH – MEMORY

RONIN stands over a corpse, chest heaving. Blood streaks across his blade.

BACK TO PRESENT

Clint blinks. Hard.

Shakes it off.

LAURA sees it. She knows that look.

LAURA

(gently, knowing)

Hey. Where’d you go?

Clint forces a small smile.

But then—ANOTHER FLASH.

⸻

FLASHBACK – VORMIR

The wind howls.

A violet sky, vast and empty.

NATASHA clings to the cliff’s edge—her hand locked in Clint’s.

Her face is calm. Her voice, firm.

NATASHA

(softly, unwavering)

Let me go.

Clint grips tighter.

A beat. He shakes his head, barely breathing.

CLINT

(a whisper, broken)

I can’t.

Natasha smiles—just a little.

And then… her legs kick off the cliff wall, creating enough force to shake his grip loose.

⸻

BACK TO PRESENT

Clint’s coffee cup trembles in his hand.

He sets it down.

Eyes locked on nothing.

The sound of laughter fades behind him.

Clint stands.

Walks away from the table.

Laura watches him go.

She says nothing.

CUT TO BLACK.

⸻

EXT. FOREST CLEARING – EARLY MORNING

Mist clings to the trees. The earth is still. Somewhere in the woods, a figure stirs.

WANDA lies in the dirt—disoriented, trembling, alive.

Her fingers are blackened, her body weak.

She blinks up at the sky—confused. Empty.

She doesn’t remember who she is.

She doesn’t remember her magic.

She only knows: something inside her is broken.

She pushes herself up.

Staggers to her feet.

Nearby, a shallow river.

She catches her reflection in the water—

But doesn’t recognize it.

Her fingers instinctively twitch.

A faint flicker of red—then nothing.

FLASHES – QUICK CUTS

— A bomb explodes in Sokovia.

— VISION’S lifeless body.

— Screams echo through Kamar-Taj.

— Chaos. Fire. Loss.

BACK TO SCENE

Wanda clutches her head.

She drops to her knees — gasping.She doesn’t understand what’s happening.

She can’t tell her dreams from reality anymore.

SHE’S ALSO NOT ALONE.

## What is Ethereum 2.0 ProAir?

Ethereum 2.0 ProAir is an automated trading platform designed to help everyday users take advantage of crypto market volatility. It uses **advanced algorithms and AI-driven tools** to analyze market conditions, make predictions, and execute trades — all without needing you to be glued to the screen 24/7.

If you're familiar with platforms like Immediate Edge or Bitcoin Era, this is in the same ballpark, but with a sleeker interface and more customization options. The goal is simple: make crypto trading more accessible, less risky (well, relatively), and more efficient for newbies and semi-pros alike.

## Who Created Ethereum 2.0 ProAir?

This is where things get a little murky. Like many crypto trading platforms, **Ethereum 2.0 ProAir doesn’t have a clear founder listed** on its website. It claims to be developed by a team of financial analysts, software engineers, and crypto experts. Classic, right?

That said, this isn’t necessarily a red flag. Many reputable platforms use teams rather than individuals as figureheads. From what I could tell during testing, the software is stable, the customer service is responsive, and the tech under the hood feels professional — not something slapped together overnight.

## How Does Ethereum 2.0 ProAir Work?

In a nutshell, Ethereum 2.0 ProAir uses **AI and machine learning** to scan the market, identify trends, and place trades based on pre-set parameters. You can choose to let the software run in full-auto mode, or you can tweak the settings to match your style — think of it like cruise control vs. manual driving.

Here’s what happens behind the scenes:

- The algorithm analyzes **real-time market data**.
- It predicts potential opportunities based on trends and historical data.
- If the conditions match your chosen strategy, it executes the trade.
- You can monitor everything from your dashboard or app.

It’s kind of like having a robo-trader doing the heavy lifting while you sit back and enjoy your coffee.

## Ethereum 2.0 ProAir Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real — no platform is perfect. But here’s the breakdown of what I liked and what could be better:

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Super beginner-friendly** — no need to be a trading ninja.
- ✅ **Fast trade execution**.
- ✅ **Demo account** for learning the ropes.
- ✅ **Real-time insights** with AI support.
- ✅ **Low initial deposit** ($250 is manageable for most users).
- ✅ **Supports multiple assets** beyond crypto.

**Cons:**

- ❌ **No mobile app** (yet) — only mobile browser access.
- ❌ **No clear info on founders** — would be nice to have transparency.
- ❌ **High volatility still applies** — automation helps, but doesn’t guarantee profits.

- **Live chat** (available 24/7)
- **Email support** (response time: ~12 hrs)
- **Phone call support** (for verified users only)

In my experience, they were friendly and helpful. Not bots, actual humans. Which is sadly rare these days.

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official Ethereum 2.0 ProAir site and hit the register button. Fill in your name, email, and phone number. Takes about 2 minutes.

I came to terms with it, then she said she “realized” she missed me in her life and it was rough to hear 

had a really nice talk with a friend who got super busy with life and so did I and we both became distant. It started as her being chronically busy and bailing all the time on plans that I made with her bc she never made plans first. At first I was hurt but I came to terms with it bc shit happens and life happens; no one owes time or explanations. She sent me a cryptic text on my bday after low contact for MONTHS on end and zero effort for a year (hadn’t seen her in over a year even though we live in the same city!). She basically said she “realized” that she misses me in her life ….That didnt sit well with me. I told her thanks for the kind wishes, I hope we can connect soon, however I acknowledged that we had drifted/ it was also on me for not speaking up and stopping reaching out. I mentioned that initally when she was always bailing and busy, i didn’t want to be a bother and be the only one reaching out/responding bc she literally had not texted me in months and months. I was happy to reconnect moving forward if we both could work on better communication and showing up. And I offered to match my time with hers since shes super busy all the time (haha then she said she was never annoyed about it but “realized” again now now nice it was to have someone stay in touch … also kinda not sitting right with me but i want to try to move forward) 

Im thankful she received the conversation and I feel better after it. When moving forward with a friend in a new direction (I need new boundaries, she will probably more a more distant friend now which is fine to me). What should i do and ensure healthy communication and boundaries moving forward? Making sure she also offers plans so it’s not one sided? Meeting for a quick coffee first to feel the waters and schedule something routinely (like lunch once a month) and seeing how it goes? 

Has anyone had a difficult convo with a friend like this and moved forward just fine?

1k09i35,https://i.redd.it/rxnal2lnv3ve1.jpeg,"Sourdough, art print I made, Recipe Included [Humor]","# Ingredients for a ""Sourdough Bread Art Print""

* 1 cup of digital creativity (freshly harvested)
* 2 tablespoons of patience (aged at least 24 hours)
* 1/3 cup of artistic vision (wild-caught, not store-bought)
* 4 cups of digital ink (preferably in warm, toasty browns)
* 1 starter image of sourdough bread (must be at least 80% hydration...of pixels)
* 1 sturdy cardboard backing (rescued from an Amazon package)
* 1 picture frame (preferably wooden for that artisanal feel)
* A pinch of humor
* 3 tablespoons of coffee (for the artist, not the art)
* 1/2 teaspoon of pretentiousness (optional, but recommended for authentic art experience)

# Process

1. Begin by feeding your creativity with 2-3 Pinterest boards. Allow to expand for several hours.
2. In a large digital workspace, combine your starter image with digital ink. Knead vigorously with mouse clicks until it develops a good texture. Do not overwork or your art will become dense and unappetizing.
3. Let your design proof on your screen for 30 minutes while you contemplate the deep philosophical connection between bread and art.
4. During this time, prepare your coffee. This step is crucial - undercaffeinated artists produce flat, lifeless bread art.
5. After proofing, stretch and fold your design by adding more contrast and perhaps a witty bread pun caption. Look for good bubble formation in your design (these are called ""artistic elements"").
6. Pour design onto printer. If it sticks to the printer, you've done something terribly wrong.
7. Score the top of your print with a signature (this is purely decorative but makes you feel professional).
8. Bake at 0 degrees for 0 minutes (remember, this is art, not actual bread).
9. Allow print to rest until your significant other stops asking ""are you still working on that bread picture?""
10. Mount on cardboard, frame, and hang in kitchen. Stand back and admire while explaining to guests that it's ""a commentary on society's consumption of both art and carbohydrates.""
11. For best results, mist your guests with water while they view the art to simulate the perfect crusty bread environment.

1k09hzw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k09hzw,8 Days in Iceland: My Story,"# Preface
***
I briefly reported on my two days in Snæfellsnes Peninsula while I was there [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1jiczic/two_days_in_snæfellsnes_peninsula_a_report/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

This is the rest of my 6 day journey going through the south up to Höfn and back.
Part ""guide"" and part ""field report"". The first quarter is just information on how I planned the trip and the gear I brought which may be beneficial for first time visitors who are in their research phase. The Adventure section is about my journey.

# Planning
***
First, I don't regret a single dime I spent in Iceland or how I planned my itinerary. I *knew* going into this fairly early it will be expensive so I started saving literally up to the month of departure; 6 months. So, $6,000 USD. And I spent all of it. Majority was about my comfort and not counting money, and other expenses were more or less ""surprises"". So basically, *everything else*. Cost of eating, gas, and my blunder hastily booking a Dacia Duster (I don't drive manual) and spending extra to upgrade to AWD Automatic + insurance (definitely worth it getting insurance. The weather will be a very key factor if you're traveling in winter months and you want to be covered.)

I started planning in October after finally deciding I'm going. My reasoning for choosing when I went was primarily to catch the northern lights *but obviously you shouldn't plan your trips around that solely*. So due to the weather (which I heard about on and on through this sub until I got to experience it firsthand) I sort of just gave up halfway in and went on with my itinerary. I did catch them on my very last night while staying in Eyrarbakki on March 29, around midnight. More on that later.

I could've booked a tour and be done with it, but I enjoy traveling solo and have the freedom to explore how I want to. So I went to a coffee shop and spent a whole full day early in October just doing a total immersion of research through this sub and jotting down everything of interest and informational value in a Word document which was roughly organized; East, West, North, South.

A week or so later I decided to focus this trip mainly on Snaefellsnes to Höfn through the south and leave the Westfjords to Eastfjords through the north on later trip. And throughout the next 6 months all the information I collected in my Word doc was a combination of reading this sub and reading [Fodor's Essential Iceland](https://www.amazon.com/Fodors-Essential-Iceland-Full-color-Travel/dp/1640975632/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=79IW3HQDUAOG&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fGykfKyRQM_w5EKU16LixoSKGP0FDYM-4Aw9dK6lM8cBwi6ocXeuL2CBadhqGmR6up8TSYyTG4TusmvGHJhjustvPbiKU4s3rQUdCioN9MXCKb_F92IKzMdAk4JKbMEQpz0-sBkxeAS37TDeKiT3LOpXktP6MrDM3YYy8SASqCRiAWSKjFXJGOHsHv89TAslpOBMKDIwxrwpx70-vx4EKWv7CrhBTWZHWotKVlxaTgs.O-lBu8pxI13qcdGEzhcUmrU5HzBxvldU8Wx70MBzceU&dib_tag=se&keywords=travel+guide+iceland&qid=1743976656&sprefix=travel+guide+iceland%2Caps%2C113&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1) just to fill some gaps (but it's not necessary). I would sort this info into proper areas of interest such as; Snæfellsnes, Reykjanes, Golden Circle, Vik, Höfn and overtime have a ""mental map"" of sorts of where everything is before I got to Iceland. 

Around early February I purchased [Photographing Iceland](https://photographingiceland.is/photographing-iceland-a-photo-guide-to-100-locations/) as it was recommended to me by u/BionicGeek when I posted asking for suggestions as a photographer; also a good resource if you're a photographer.

So a lot of my itinerary was sourced from here and other material to prepare. If you're traveling solo, I would recommend you plan as if your life depended on it. Because of the hours spent I was prepared entirely for the weather conditions and everything in between. A quick note on driving in windy/snowy weather; if you are already a solid driver you will be ok if you remain self-aware and sensical on the road. If it's too much, find the first pull-off area and just wait it out but I'd recommend that only for a whiteout if it happens. I saw plenty of people who slowed down and there were anywhere from 4-5 cars behind them. Personally, I trusted in my ability so whenever I found a good stretch of a straight road with good visibility I would pass these cars one, two at a time if I was in a hurry. I saw others do the same safely. But better be safe than sorry if you don't want to ruin your trip and get into a ditch then don't do it and drive slow, homie.

I began booking everything within the first week of February. Seeing as my trip was third week of March and technically ""off season"" I could still find good places for stays (although Vik was the most sold out by that point) and some sales for the tours I took. I did Katla Ice Cave and Skaftafell Glacier Walk both with Arctic Adventures which had a 10% discount.

#### Clothing & Gear

I'm going to list basically everything I wore which kept me warm at all times. I'm not sponsored, I'm just sharing the exact brands of clothing I wore that did the job for me.

1. [The North Face Chakal Insulated Jacket](https://www.thenorthface.com/en-us/p/mens/mens-jackets-and-vests/mens-ski-and-snowboarding-jackets-299293/mens-chakal-insulated-jacket-NF0A87Y6?color=5IF) (overall this kept me extremely warm in all sorts of conditions and was perfect for walking up close to Skogafoss. No need for goofy Frogg Toggs that I saw some people wear. It was my overall *key* *uniform* for everything.
2. [686 Standard Shell Pants](https://www.686.com/products/686-mens-standard-pant) (only wore it *once* for the glacier walk)
3. [Ski Mask](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086Z2WR6Y?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) (only wore it for glacier walk)
4. [Winter Bomber Hat](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZZ427CS?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) (My favorite. Wore it everyday. Offers extra wind protection since you can button it up and cover your ears and can be worn on top of any other hat you got on; I wore a baseball cap). I saw quite a few people wearing bomber hats too which was a good conversation starter.
5. [Merrell Waterproof Hiking Boots](https://www.rei.com/product/237596/merrell-moab-3-mid-waterproof-hiking-boots-mens) (A godsend of gear I recommend to anyone, whatever brand, but choose waterproof). These boots combined with Merino Wool ""Darn Tough"" socks I wore got my ass saved on *three different occasions*. The first of which was when I wanted to get close to Skogafoss and had to hop through some small rocks submerged in water that lead into the center area and close to the waterfall. This is when I first got to ""field test"" them as I literally stepped into water and I was fine, I felt very slight wetness if I was really walking in water (submerged to the ankles). But most of it got absorbed by the boots or the socks and kept it off from soaking my feet. Second time was literally getting submerged at the Diamond Beach (I mean I was walking in water for a bit...accidentally) and third time was on my last night while at the beach photographing an Aurora in Eyrarbakki. Get waterproof boots if you plan to do wild hiking or crazy stuff like I did.
6. I brought some [686 GoreTex Gloves](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B99625RK?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) but I honestly didn't wear them since I was either capturing things on my phone or photographing all the time. But holy crap did my hands freeze quick near Gulfoss one day. Instead what I did was I bought a [10-pack of Hand Warmers](https://www.rei.com/product/198659/ignik-hand-warmers-multipack) from REI and just wore them inside my pockets every day which worked out perfectly.
7. [Nitecore Headlamp](https://nitecorestore.com/products/nitecore-nu53-rechargeable-industrial-headlamp?currency=USD&variant=46605928530162&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Google%20Shopping&stkn=7c837d14c0cf&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw782_BhDjARIsABTv_JBLiBFKlC7nRqkVVTN6xqqoHA5-eY4w4zWLAAtNTYe-oklred_L54kaAvL9EALw_wcB) \- incredibly useful at night. I took it knowing I'd be taking photos of the northern lights.
8. [Vortex Triumph HD 10x42 Binoculars](https://www.amazon.com/Vortex-Optics-Triumph-10x42-Binoculars/dp/B0C6N72X5Y/ref=sr_1_3?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kk3I_nmeQp_jlz6y0VNI_1Yvsdm_kXEAXZPc8r6oBbyg0mcK1poro6bgcJXC4PI6UglGgVwk9M7QYfFn4unScAkQ_Bfk-87WjdtJZQFoU4EyiQmBbkfj7t1y4Z-Z0ZjhzhB05xSyeq2IAk3H3itclFGVLdK9EkRUTlWpSHRkM5g_TTT6bEstv5Uw5d-6lBItTA5VOwGRmcXPRav_vS1K4YIVAj7cARSMkCnm2vppoNk.Ba8fW4Peg5OMc4KC85XHeQGLV-mz_N13am7YwwB0Hq8&dib_tag=se&hvadid=694586903693&hvdev=c&hvexpln=67&hvlocphy=9008161&hvnetw=g&hvocijid=5950831999507810645--&hvqmt=b&hvrand=5950831999507810645&hvtargid=kwd-297749364667&hydadcr=18474_13462186&keywords=vortex+binoculars+10x42&mcid=9179887f0f4f373fab580b1fb46a7acc&qid=1743979958&sr=8-3) \- If you're a nature lover like myself, this is a must. To get the most out of your adventure, get yourself a set of decent introductory binos and don't leave home without it. My visual experience of Iceland was amplified by putting these on in front of my eyes wherever I went. You can see whales/orcas in the distance shooting off water, all sorts of birdlife up close, seals, and every cool detail anywhere you look. I saw only a handful of people with binos on my trip so that was cool. Unless you have a good telephoto lens on your DSLR, you're not seeing a lot of that cool wildlife or nature up close. It's a different ballgame.
9. All my photography gear was packed inside a [PeakDesign Everyday 30L backpack ](https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Design-Everyday-Backpack-BEDB-30-BK-3/dp/B0DKLWFRKV/ref=sr_1_4?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.lpF5DFSij_zqaPAGXhvG644ZTiVsnCQK0pbMWX3PDX2MTHdwcqg8oHcloRm87ffzMxgpBG7tey2ZeJwaLD_0fRn9sW2uxUewZ0KyVKBhraqBrZHCOiNJ5S-qrDVIFzItlgb9zO-IZY1Np3R4I8MQsDTgW0cu8ZKmDv5gZ3a_hkjG7uDOUbe3gp6FNPd0zLOqHoKjylX8jVV8yGYB_W1lhyn6pprCOkJLk0EEv2lkcoQ.hL-7aZOOyowVUuSamu6_HFteNu-FpyOGyGe_icsMqIA&dib_tag=se&hvadid=694623531355&hvdev=c&hvexpln=67&hvlocphy=9008161&hvnetw=g&hvocijid=5222336833380298557--&hvqmt=e&hvrand=5222336833380298557&hvtargid=kwd-424206558862&hydadcr=2835_13623712&keywords=peakdesign+30l&mcid=7b95492714b336f0a4123a2d85a63377&qid=1743981122&sr=8-4)which has a shell all over it and is waterproof resistant which I also took with me up on the glacier walk and was able to switch lenses while I was up there.

Everything else I wore as normal. I wore a t-shirt, and a basic sweater underneath my insulated jacket daily. No base layers. Same for pants. I wore the [Under Armour leggings](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LNYJDD9?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2&th=1&psc=1) like two times under my jeans and that was it. Overall it wasn't that terribly cold when I was there to wear base layers, but wear them if you like. I alternated between jeans and chinos, the key for cold weather was the jacket and just a sweater underneath, a good hat, maybe a skimask and some hand warmers in pockets and I was set. I would put on the boots only when I was hiking somewhere. Even at the seals beach in SP I think I wore my regular Gola sneakers.

Now on to the experience...

# The Adventure Begins
***

I'll split it into areas I covered sans Snæfellsnes which again, you can see pictures of and read about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1jiczic/two_days_in_snæfellsnes_peninsula_a_report/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

#### Reykjavík to Hvolsvöllur

After my two days in SP I headed to Hvolsvöllur which was just a stopover before I really get into the south for the remainder of my trip. But on the way there I spent half a day just exploring Reykjavík and spending about an hour at Þingvellir (which was low on my priority so I decided to get it out early and quickly). While in Reykjavík I went to the rooftop of the church which provided me with a nice panoramic view of the city in all directions, got Brauð & co. and the famous hot dog at the Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur stand. That was my first introduction to the hot dog I would be eating every chance I could when I stopped at N1 gas stations. It was so good I had to buy the second one. I liked what I saw the time I was there and met some people that I talked to and exchanged socials with. Overall if I wanted to experience the city life I would for sure stay there for more to immerse myself but it wasn't my focus. It was also overcast and raining a bit but I did an accelerated stopover since I had Reykjavík in the plans for the end of the trip and knew I was going to come back again.

I drove to Hvolsvöllur during the dark so I saw the geothermal steam rising from the Reykjadalur Valley that was illuminated by the lights, but I didn't see much while driving to my destination at night. I stayed in a tiny cabin in Hamar.

#### Vik, The waterfalls and the Black Sand beaches...


The next morning was when I began to see some of that wonderful scenery everyone talks about that begins from about Hella.

The first stop was Seljalandsfoss and my first experience seeing a waterfall of this magnitude in Iceland. It was raining that day and tourists began to gather. This was when I first began to experience a lot of the same people literally dressed up for instagram selfies. Majority of them were Asian girls dressed in all white like they were straight out of an anime. No rain gear no nothing, just a quick photo and back to the car. It was amusing cause I'd see those same type of people in Skógafoss and the black sand beaches near Vik.

Skógafoss was for sure a more impressive waterfall in my view. You could feel the immense power of that water and this is where a lot of the rain gear was vital especially if you wanted to get very, very close to it. I even hiked up to the top of it with my backpack and felt the murderous nature of that hike. But it was worth it for the photographs and the seagulls I saw nesting in the cliffs which I got a closer look at with my binoculars.

Next up was Dyrhólaey which by the time I arrived close to 1pm the sun was beginning to break through which I was thankful for after all the rain and clouds that covered most of the scenery. I didn't explore it as much as I wanted to because I wanted to hit Reynisfjara Beach before my first guided tour which was Katla Ice Cave. However it was undoubtedly an impressive panorama of imagery.

By the time I got to Reynisfjara there were hordes of tourists near and on top of the basalt columns on the side of the cliff. I kind of had to walk further away and frame my shots in the way that avoided them. There was one man that had on rubber ""galoshes"" that dangerously close to water. I hope he knew what he was doing cause those rogue waves are real. Thankfully I was aware of the warnings through this sub to watch out for them so I constantly kept my eye on the waves and could kind of foresee far in the distance when a rogue wave was about to hit. They would come every few other waves. I got my photos in, simmered in the sights, looked through my binos and went to the meetup spot near Krónan in Vik.

While waiting for the super jeep I talked to one of the Arctic Adventure drivers for another tour — Rebekka, who showed me what a real ""whiteout"" looks like on her phone. And I thought *my* drive from SP to Reykjavík was bad...

#### Katla Ice Cave

No doubt the first ""off-road"" experience in Iceland and totally worth it. Our guide was Jón. A true, down-to-the-bone Icelander with a dry sense of humor and smell of cigarette smoke all over him. Had I not stopped smoking I would've burned one with him after the tour — a cool cat. We spent a good 3 hours with him and I got to sit at the front seat making conversation all throughout the ride, the tour, and back. This is definitely a type of guy I'd love to have drank and talk life with. Sadly my one and only prolonged interaction with an Icelander but a memorable one.

The tour itself was cool. We stopped at a scenic overlook — all covered in snow, as if a scene from **The Thing (1982)** \— and got to take some photos for about 15 minutes before taking a steep drop down the hill in the jeep to which Jón took his hands off the wheel in good humor as if replicating a rollercoaster ride. It got a laugh out of all. I mean this guy does this 7 days on (and 7 days off) so I trusted him with that bit of humor... lol

We took a walk up the glacier and were accompanied by a ""krummi"" all throughout — a raven that followed us through from beginning of our walk to the end; which Jon was prepared for with some bread he would throw the bird all throughout the walk. As we talked about ravens he told me ""*These birds definitely know more than we do.*"" It was a magical type of experience indeed.

I saw the Ice caves covered in black ash and got some good information out of Jón. He had everyone chop some ice with an axe and later on had us all participate in a traditional ""vikivaki"" folk dance as I photographed the raven that was posing for me against the Hafursey mountain but I turned around just in time to capture the dance on video.

As we packed up and set on our ride back I recognized the scenery that I saw in the opening sequence of **Star Wars: Rogue One (2016)**. A desolate landscape but magical nevertheless in winter time. I felt like I *was* in **The Thing**. A truly memorable for me moment as a huge cinephile.

Once we returned, I took my only selfie with a local and we said our goodbyes. After that point I checked into my hotel and went to get some awesome local beer and food at Smiðjan Brugghús as I began to curate my instagram stories.

#### Journey Towards the Glacier

I have to say the breakfast that is served in hotels are something to write home about. Delicious and filling. After that, I set on my journey to Skaftafell. It was overcast, cloudy and somewhat rainy. My first stop was the Yoda cave, and my first time trying the AWD SUV in an ""off-road"" scenario, since the road leading up to the cave wasn't paved. But I took it slow and it fared well. I thought it was worth a short stop just to see the natural wonder that the cave was. A case of ""life imitates art"" or vice versa? Can't tell if George Lucas saw the cave in the 70's before creating Yoda...

I didn't spend much time there so I set out to drive towards Skaftafell to make my 3pm tour. Fairly early on I mumbled to myself, as I was driving something along the lines of ""*Came to see Iceland...*"" while driving through rain and low visibility. So the ""disappointment"" of the weather after SP was kind of setting in. It was like that all until I got to the glacier and I was even thinking they'd cancel the tour. I was happy it wasn't, yet somewhat lukewarm to the idea of walking it in such poor visibility and rain which thankfully cleared up by the time we got to the glacier.

Our guide was Tomasz, a bearded Polish man. At this point I was curious why I was encountering so many Polish or Eastern Europeans in all my hotels or gas stations I stopped at, until I asked and learned they're the biggest minority in Iceland. Being a Ukrainian, and a Polish neighbor, when the time came to  split into groups I decided to go with him. He later told me I'm the first Ukrainian he had met doing the glacier walk with him. I am sure there have been others before me though.

Suffice it to say this was my first ever such experience, so the information gleaned plus the actual experience of walking in crampons and on ice *and* taking in the sights (that I could see that wasn't covered by cloud layers hanging over the glacier) it was *really* hitting me that I'm doing something of a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" type of experience. Tomasz was a good guy and overall an informative guide who explained the inner workings of how glaciers are formed, what  a ""moulin"" is, how wind creates 'wavy' textures in the crevasses, etc.

We then made our walk to the small ""blue"" ice cave, got to drink some glacial water, took some final photos and made our way back to the AA hut back at the camp. I headed back to Vik and by this point the skies cleared enough and sun was breaking through that I got to see the beautiful landscape driving back. It's where it made sense to me the expression ""If you don't like the weather, wait 5 minutes"". In this case however it's more like a few hours or ""wait until you pass the curve around this mountain or area"". It really does never stay static and I understood the charm of it all. I've never experienced anything like it.

As I drove back to Vik, I stopped at a few places where I *could* without endangering traffic to take photos of the beautiful mountains and ""fire-y"" light breaking through the clouds as well as a longer exposure photo during the blue hour of the Reynisdrangar basalt sea stacks in the distance as I pulled off into the access road for Uxafótafoss. While in my sweater alone and fighting freezing cold wind I set my camera on a tripod and gripped to stabilize it (the wind was intense) when I pressed on the timed shutter (only photographers will understand hehe). I got someone honking as they passed me which I only choose to acknowledge as a ""Rock on, dude"" moment. By this point in time I was truly living up my Iceland moment...

Dropped off my stuff at the hotel and went to get some Black Crust Pizza to take back to the hotel as I curated my Insta stories for the day and prepared for my drive to Höfn in the morning.

#### Icebergs, The Town of the Four Glaciers and The Desolation of Vestrahorn

In the morning I set the course for Höfn, a town and a drive that would undoubtedly become my favorite in this adventure.

Once I passed around the curve of Vatnajökull near Fagurhólsmýri is when the scenery became very different. Especially after Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon. It was also the first morning where I got to catch a lot of clear skies almost to the moment I arrived in Höfn. It did get a bit overcast near the Glacier Lagoon (and very cold) but the combination of visibility and the scenery *really* made me *feel* something different.

I spent a good 1.5 hours in the Lagoon, mainly because I was just exploring different parts of it and trying to photograph it and I even wanted to come back to it to photograph it during sunrise the next day but ultimately did not. It was quite a sight to see all the ice in the lagoon but I definitely got there when there were a lot of tourists so I kind of spent more time there than I would've mainly because of trying to shoot around the tourists at the Diamond beach and my hands got so freezing cold there that I really didn't get to capture the type of photographs I wanted to. I even saw a huge piece of ice float out of the lagoon into the ocean. So if anything that I would've done slightly differently about this portion is get there way earlier during sunrise had I stayed closer to it overnight. Mainly to beat the crowds and perhaps get much more interesting photographs of the beach and the lagoon. I saw some seals popping their heads out of the lagoon, the binoculars which I brought were of good use here to see them slightly closer.

But honestly it was everything post Lagoon that I enjoyed immensely. There is a solid reason Vatnajökull is registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is beautiful. And that drive along the coastline is something else. All the glacier tongues that you pass and the beautiful snowy capped peaks of various mountains, the way that road curves around Kalfafellsstadur all the way to Höfn. Just spectacular. Obviously an adventure is a journey of discovery so I didn't want to do too much ""pre-visualizing"" the places I'm going to go to, but Höfn is a town I would've easily dedicated two full days in instead of one. I don't regret my trip itinerary because everything to me was an experience to have lived. However, knowing what I know now, for the future, I will for sure spend more time in that area. I will take a beautiful stretch of mountains over waterfalls anyday as my preference and that area did it for me.

I stayed at the Milk Factory and when I checked in I still had a good couple of hours of light left so I drove to the overlook in the town and the first wonder for me was seeing the four glacier tongues in the distance. There is a viewpoint on top of a hill that provides an awesome panoramic view of the coastline of all the glaciers and the rest of the town; all the way to the tip of Vestrahorn. So you get a great look of the town *and all the mountain range behind it*.

After taking some photos from that viewpoint, I went straight to Vestrahorn and I have to say that was definitely another huge highlight for me personally. After walking into the cafe, grabbing a coffee and a buying a pass while talking to the barista there (I forgot his name, but it was a young spaniard guy) who also gave me just an awesome suggestion and I thank him for it (you'll see it in the picture accompanied with the post) I set out to the Stokksnes parking lot that's near the Höfn AFB. By this point the wind was so intensely strong and cold (just like the wind I encountered in Snæfellsjökull View Point my second day in SP) that I felt like I was in a sci-fi film set on a different planet. Mind you, the scenery of Stokksnes, with the open wide black sand beach and Vestrahorn as a backdrop, would surely transport you into such a scenario.

I started walking along that beach with my course set to the edge of Vestrahorn where the barista suggested I go and it was quite a walk. I started tracking on my AllTrails about halfway into the beach walk and by the time I got to my car I spent 53 minutes so all in all I may have spent a good hour and a half there and back plus time spent observing the ""sight"". I was the only one there, most people I saw that went to the Stokksnes only walked up just to the edge but I was the only one who went down on the beach. Memorable. The wind was so strong it blew the black sand in the direction the wind went (from the ocean).

All in all it was worth it, just the landscape of it, the wind, the texture and things seen. It was a definite highlight and I highly recommend Stokksnes.

After that, I checked out the Viking Village but I didn't spend a lot of time there, although I did run into three Italian girls I was on a glacier walk with the day before and set them on course to see what I saw. I think the Viking Village was cool but something I just ""checked off the list"". Knowing it's a film set didn't make it all too special but nevertheless as a film fan I appreciated the production value and how these things are built to aid in visual stories.

I ended my day in Höfn with a nice solo dinner at Pakkhus. This was the first time I tried the lobster soup and lamb which I subsequently had more of in Eyrarbakki and Kaffavagnin in the last two days of my adventure. Totally worth it.

#### The Long Journey Back: Sjónarnípa and The Great View

This day, I knew was going to be the longest day of driving since I had a *whopping* 5 hour drive to go through between Höfn and Eyrarbakki and initially I wasn't going to stop anywhere because I had this idea that I would spend the last two days checking out the Golden Circle, Reykjanes and Reykjavík. So I tried to maximize my time knowing full well I'd be somewhat tired driving. However, as of waking up in the morning I decided to switch it up.

I made the decision to stop at the Skaftafell glacier again and do the Sjónarnípa hike up to the viewpoint to see the glacier in all its glory. I said to myself ""*You'll be kicking yourself that you were this close to seeing this view and didn't do it*."" So once I got there, I went for it. From the two days before while talking to the person at the visitor center, I knew that Sjónarnípa was the more arduous trail to take and there was an *easier* option. I was considering the easy option but just as I got to the fork, I decided I'm going for the Sjónarnípa. In short, it was worth it. No question it's difficult. I had a backpack with my photography gear plus my jacket which I took off 40 minutes into the hike because *it is* steep and you *will get tired* and hot as you sweat. I'm in an OK shape and I don't recommend it if you have heart conditions. But what you get from taking that hike is that you gradually get higher and higher and still see the glacier within sight as opposed to the easier hike closer to the Svartifoss waterfall, which I ended up taking on the way back (and skipping Svartifoss, cause to be honest I'm just not a waterfall guy. I picked and chose which ones were worth it for me).

You spend a good 40 minutes of really difficult hiking up the edge of the hill/mountain but it levels off after that and the next 20 minutes are much easier. But once you get up to the view point — it is just spectacular. And this is where my binos came in handy. I got to immerse myself in more detail from the viewpoint looking on to the glacier up close utilizing them and seeing all the cool details of the glacier. I spent about 30-40 minutes up there photographing as well as just taking a quiet moment to look at the view all around it and I'll never forget it. I highly recommend it to anyone who's up for the challenge and who is fit enough to do it. If you're not, you can take the easier hike and still see the glacier from the top. It's spectacular.

Once I got down ground level, I pretty much gunned it all the way to Eyrarbakki with a short stop at Vik to take some more photos of the beach — which on that day had particularly active and strong waves — and fill up my car. Always fill up your car even if you are half a tank full. I caught the waves breaking into the beach and completely covering the view of the Reynisdrangar basalt sea stacks. Quite a moment to take in. Then resumed the drive to Eyrarbakki just in time for the sunset, a walk along the edge of the village and a nice meal at Rauða Húsið. The only restaurant in the village which was quite warm and inviting. An American woman who's been living in Iceland for 12 years manages it and I had a nice conversation with her about the experience living in Iceland, what I've seen, and ask her some questions I had. I was amused as she was the first American I've ever met that had an accent while speaking English, understandably. This was also the place where I had my first shot of Brennivín. Slightly tipsy I took my second stroll through the streets of a local village, the first being in Hellisandur.

#### The Hike to Geothermal River, Golden Circle and the Northern Lights

I dedicated the last of my full day to check out the sights that were lower in my priority. Because I did a brief stop at Þingvellir on my way back from SP, I left Geysir and Gulfoss until the end since they're so close together. But prior to that I stopped to see the Reykjadalur Hot Spring while on my way to Reykjavík to get the wool sweater from Handknitted.

It was a bit spontaneous and I never planned the hike. However, in the end it was worth it. It took about two hours in total; there and back and I just started following people. Once I passed the very first curve after the viewpoint I turned back since I didn't know where it all leads until asking someone walking up where everyone was going. After convincing me there is a river up there I decided to trek it. It was indeed the second hardest hike I've done after Sjónarnípa but in the end it was worth it just to see it. I didn't take a dip there because I wasn't planning it and left my swimming shorts at the hotel. But I will say that it's worth the hike especially earlier in the day if you want the spring somewhat less populated. I hiked around 10am and by the time I got there at 11am there were few people there than when I was coming back. It *is* remote and it takes effort to get there. I made the note for the future to take a dip, took some photos and videos and went back. I was in my car by 12pm. Early in the hike you do see some cool geothermal activity like bubbling muddy earth, and steam mixed with gases that smells like rotten eggs.

It was a particularly clear day and I got to spend a few hours in Reykjavík seeing it in a completely different light; literally. Got my sweater and asked the lady that worked at Handknitted about *one* recommendation to get some food at and she suggested Kaffavagnin. The food was fresh and excellent and the view from the harbor was decent. You will see mostly locals there but there were some tourists there as well.

I then set out to drive to see Geysir and Gulfoss. By the time I got to Geysir it was overcast, freezing cold and snowing. One note about Geysir, I have heard people say it did not impress them as they compare it to what they've seen at Yellowstone or other places but for someone like me who has never seen one up close I thought it was worth the trip. I spent about an hour there overall and it was more than enough. I've seen it shoot up close to 7-8 times within I'd say 30 minutes? It's sporadic. You may wait 5 minutes and get a weak shot and then wait another 5. Or you may get 3 in a row. It varies. Nevertheless it was memorable.

It only took me about 5-6 minutes to get to Gulfoss after that and by that point it was so cold (and I forgot my handwarmers) that I didn't spend much time there; just enough to take a cool shot of the waterfall on a tripod with an ND filter under cool blueish tone light. I simmered in the sight, looked through binoculars and drove back to Eyrarbakki.

I should mention that as I drove back to home base, the combination of music I was listening to; Hans Zimmer's ""Journey to the Line"", the blue hour, weather and scenery made me emotional and get slightly teary eyed. All of the senses and the sights experienced really caught up with me. I allowed this moment of catharsis to happen in total presence.

As I got to Eyrarbakki, ate and re-packed my case the forecast for the skies was particularly clear around the area and the KP index was a 3; I used [this](https://en.vedur.is/weather/forecasts/aurora/). It was forecasting that around 11pm you will begin seeing the activity. I took my tripod, my headlamp and set out to the area about a mile up which was recommended to me by the American woman that managers the Rauða Húsið restaurant. It was pitch black dark because the light pollution in that area is minimal. This is where the headlamp was incredibly useful. I saw something in the skies in a curly shape that was moving and until I set my tripod up and took a long exposure photo it wasn't clear if it was the aurora or just illuminated clouds. Indeed, it was the aurora. Because of the KP3 index rating it was a weaker aurora but nevertheless it showed quite well in the shots I took and you could see it with a naked eye a bit, changing shape. I shot it with the recommended settings in the [Photographing Iceland](https://photographingiceland.is/photographing-iceland-a-photo-guide-to-100-locations/) book but made my own adjustments accordingly. I spent about an hour there trying different angles as it hovered in the clear sky above me getting weaker and weaker. I decided it was enough and off I went back to the hotel, satisfied that the Norse gods smiled upon me and granted me my wish to see them once again after almost 25 years of seeing it for the first time on my last day before moving from Minnesota to a different state.

#### The Last Day

I packed up, said my goodbyes to the receptionist and passed a Thank You note to the woman at the restaurant and went clockwise around Reykjanes to the airport to make my 4pm flight. My only stop was a detour to see the Selvogsviti Lighthouse which is where the AWD car was handy for. About a 15 minute off-road drive where I got close enough to the lighthouse before deciding it was a safe spot to park the car without risking going further and getting stuck as the roads got progressively worse. I explored the lighthouse for a bit and touched it with my hands before heading back. The weather was getting cold, windy and grey.

I was curious to see the town of Grindavík, which I passed through and did a few slow drives in the streets. It was a complete ghost town as it got evacuated two years prior. But little did I know that I was there about a day and a half before the next eruption. So I could now say I've been there *this* close to the eruption. It was enough for me as an experience and a story to tell.

I made it to the airport, bought some souvenirs and it was time to go home.

#### Final Thoughts

In summary, Iceland solidified my desire for solo travel. Not only that, but for the desire to explore it further. As many who have visited this landscape, you know that it stays with you and you feel like coming back over and over again. I see why. From afar, even looking at pictures before coming here I was already impressed by the scenery. But upon setting foot on the land, it's a totally different experience altogether. The ever changing, non-static weather and landscape that shifts and morphs before your very eyes as you curve around a mountain somewhere; it's awe-inspiring.

No doubt it is an expensive adventure. I know you can try and do it for cheaper even traveling solo but I didn't want my first Icelandic adventure to be about counting money. I budgeted for it. If you can save up, it's worth it to splurge especially if you treat it as a proper vacation that *you* deserve. Travel, to me, is an investment into an experience.

I did it my way. There was a lot of driving, some of it is back and forth. You can certainly see more if you just set the course and keep going but I wanted to immerse myself; hence splitting the trip into two halves and exploring a particular area for much longer. This meant I could experience the landscape in different types of weather or go back to a place that stuck with me again. But it's all a personal choice in the end, and an experience to be had regardless.

Travel can shift your paradigm, introducing you to new sights, tastes, sounds, and people — and that's exactly what Iceland did for me.

I hope those who read my story enjoyed it, or vicariously lived it through me.

Thanks for reading about my experience to this unforgettable landscape.

It started as her being chronically busy and bailing all the time on plans that I made with her bc she never made plans first. At first I was hurt but I came to terms with it bc shit happens and life happens; no one owes time or explanations. She sent me a cryptic text on my bday after low contact for MONTHS on end and zero effort for a year (hadn’t seen her in over a year even though we live in the same city!). She basically said she “realized” that she misses me in her life ….That didnt sit well with me. I told her thanks for the kind wishes, I hope we can connect soon, however I acknowledged that we had drifted/ it was also on me for not speaking up and stopping reaching out. I mentioned that initally when she was always bailing and busy, i didn’t want to be a bother and be the only one reaching out/responding bc she literally had not texted me in months and months. I was happy to reconnect moving forward if we both could work on better communication and showing up. And I offered to match my time with hers since shes super busy all the time (haha then she said she was never annoyed about it but “realized” again now now nice it was to have someone stay in touch … also kinda not sitting right with me but i want to try to move forward) 

Im thankful she received the conversation and I feel better after it. When moving forward with a friend in a new direction (I need new boundaries, she will probably more a more distant friend now which is fine to me). What should i do and ensure healthy communication and boundaries moving forward? Making sure she also offers plans so it’s not one sided? Meeting for a quick coffee first to feel the waters and schedule something routinely (like lunch once a month) and seeing how it goes? 

Has anyone had a difficult convo with a friend like this and moved forward just fine? ",1,1744769534.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

This is a long story and I am dyslexic so there’s going to be a few spelling mistakes (sorry in advice)
I 25f always had a troubling and sometimes horrifying experience with dating. Like sometimes a comedic dark romance movie wouldn’t give this stuff justice. I had 3 separate marriage “proposals” on the first date or soon after, found out on 2 separate first dates that they were married (they were wearing their wedding rings and I ran), 2 romantic partners died tragically and 1 person that made a bet with their friends on who could “un flower” me if you will. (Note no one from that idiotic bet won but I started dating the person who made it unknowingly)
But this story is the one that I’m comfortable with sharing. Important context: I am disabled and I have been in a wheelchair since I was little. I dated both non disabled and disabled people (I don’t really care as long as we have a connection and they are not a donkey wipe).
I was 23 just got out of my longest relationship of 2 years, and I was in my “I don’t give a f” era when I got a dm from a guy 28m “loony tunes” that I knew barely from the local disability community. Our families met 10 years before at a local community event and because of our age differences we were not in the same social circles.

The dm basically said that he would like to go out with me and gave me his number. I had heard through the grapevine that he had girls just go out with him to steal from him (remember this for later) so I thought I would give him a chance (WHICH IS THE WORST DECISION) so we messaged back and forth and decided to meet up at the mall. Now the physical date was one of the best first date I had ever had at the time, we raced down the hallways in our wheelchairs , he bought me a Tim’s ice Capp , we did stuff in the bathroom (pg13 ) and at the end of the night he gave me a necklace with my initials on it. But this is where things went down hill really fast. Immediately after I got home I got a text from looney that he loves me and he wants to be my boyfriend. I was blind because of how good the date was and message him back saying that I had a great time with him but I wasn’t ready for a serious relationship because of my ex. But we can see each other if he doesn’t push for more because I liked him. He agreed so I thought. But when I woke up I got a million messages and missed Facebook calls from him. I messaged him back and told him that I just woke up and I didn’t like the name calling saying that I was a b* and then immediately love booming me saying he just wanted to be me because I was beautiful (obviously I am) and I was done with him. He obviously started to back track and started calling me but I was done but I stupidly didn’t block him.

A few weeks ago by and I went on a couple unsuccessful dates and I felt creepy about myself so when loony texted me apologizing for his actions saying that his mental health wasn’t good. I gave him a second chance and we began dating through messages (because wheelchairs and snow don’t mix and I was lonely) I knew that it was toxic when he started sending me very detailed messages on what he wanted to do with me (think of 50 shades mixed with what true crime is about) every time I try to break up with him he would say that he would harm himself and spam me with calls and messages. I eventually blocked him however he would always find the one social media that I had forgotten to block him on.

This cycle of him reaching out and apologizing, me forgiving, him crossing my boundaries and me blocking him again went on one more time. Until we were “in a relationship” but then he told me that he had a girlfriend from his church and he was only using me for his weird f up fantasies. I immediately blocked him on every social media…

Fast forward to 9 months later I’m with my current partner the sweetest and the hottest person ever. I was scrolling on facebook and I noticed that I had a message from a guy that I knew when I was 13 from the community disabled day. It was one of loonies friends message me saying loony asked him to ask me to unblock him and hear him out, and he mentioned loony has been telling everyone that I “used him” because he paid for our date and got me a gift. I apologized to his friend and explained our situation in short terms and mentioned to my partner that I was going to unblock looney to rip him a new one (because my current partner and I have healthy communication)
And boy sure I did. I basically wrote a paragraph detailing how he was wrong for involving our mutual contact to contact me and lying to him about me “using him” because he bought me a necklace and a coffee,  in my petty moment I mentioned that I was in the healthiest relationship with my partner who actually supports me and isn’t jealous of me being going to university because my partner knows that he owns me in bed but not anywhere else. And I ended it by saying I would be nice in person if we cross paths but we can’t be friends. He messaged me right away saying “can’t we even try to be friends? I love you”
I blocked him as soon as I saw his reply and I never heard from him ever since…. Thanks for listening.",0,1744769347.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,0.33,False

## What is CoinTrade 1000?

CoinTrade 1000 is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users buy, sell, and trade digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even non-crypto assets like stocks or forex. It uses real-time data and AI-driven tools to assist users in making smarter trades without needing to be glued to a screen all day.

The platform was created with both beginners and intermediate traders in mind. It offers tools that are powerful but not overwhelming. You don’t need to be a tech wizard or a Wall Street pro. That’s part of its charm — **it simplifies trading without dumbing it down.**

Overall, it feels like a tool made for people who want to actually understand what they’re doing, not just press buttons and pray.

## Who Created CoinTrade 1000?

The team behind CoinTrade 1000 prefers to stay in the background, which is pretty common with platforms like this. While there isn’t a public face like Elon Musk or Vitalik Buterin attached to it, the development team reportedly consists of **financial analysts, software engineers, and crypto enthusiasts** with experience in fintech and blockchain.

While I wish there was more transparency here, this is pretty standard for platforms in this space (looking at you, Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge). The platform itself seems well-built and maintained, which suggests a competent team is running the show, even if they’re not putting their names front and center.

# What Is ""Only 1 Deal Away"" All About?

Let’s be real—real estate wholesaling is hyped *everywhere*, but most courses feel more like a sales pitch than real game. Enter **""Only 1 Deal Away - Max Maxwell & Nasar El-Arabi""**—a no-fluff, real-talk training that actually shows you how to do wholesale deals without the smoke and mirrors. It’s not just a crash course, it’s a breakdown of what *actually works* on the streets right now.

# Who Are These Guys and Why Should You Listen?

If you’ve been circling real estate YouTube, you’ve probably stumbled across **Max Maxwell**—the guy who turned sleepless nights at “YouTube University” into a 7-figure wholesaling biz. He’s got receipts. Then there’s **Nasar El-Arabi**, aka “The Real Doru” (because he *does* deals, not just talk about them). Both of these guys are still in the trenches, making real estate deals happen—not just flexing rented Lambos and cash stacks.

These aren’t “gurus”—they’re actual practitioners sharing the steps that got them to where they are.

# When Does This All Apply?

Whether you’re just getting started or already closing a few deals here and there, the strategies inside **""Only 1 Deal Away - Max Maxwell & Nasar El-Arabi""** are timeless. Max got his first deal in just 3 weeks, while Nasar took 8 months. The point is—*it’s not about how long it takes, it’s about staying consistent*. This course gives you tools that work *now*, not just some outdated techniques from five years ago.

# Where Can You Learn It?

It’s an online training, so you can go through it anywhere—on your laptop, your phone, wherever you binge your content. Chill at a coffee shop, study during lunch breaks, or grind late at night. It’s accessible, just like wholesaling should be.

# Why Is This Course Worth Checking Out?

Because it doesn’t sugarcoat a thing. You’ll learn the actual foundations of wholesaling—from **what it really is** to **how to solve sellers’ problems** without needing some mythical “perfect list.” One huge takeaway? You don’t need a magic database of leads. You need a problem to solve—like tax liens or probate—and a willingness to be *really good* at that one area.

And if you’re trapped in a 9-5, this course hits even harder. They talk about how wholesaling can help break those “golden handcuffs” and buy back your time. Imagine trading that corporate grind for time freedom and scalable income.

# How Does It Work, Though?

Simple: Learn the basics. Choose a niche (like probate, liens, etc.). Find motivated sellers. Solve their problem. Get the contract. Assign it. Collect your check. That’s wholesaling in a nutshell—and **""Only 1 Deal Away""** walks you through each of those steps, the exact way Max and Nasar did it themselves.

The best part? You don’t need startup capital, fancy tools, or even a real estate license. Just hustle, strategy, and consistency.

**Final Thoughts?** If you’ve ever wondered whether you could actually make money in real estate without owning property, **""Only 1 Deal Away - Max Maxwell & Nasar El-Arabi""** is the proof that you can. It’s honest, actionable, and hella motivating.",1,1744769261.0,SberStudying,1,1.0,False

1k09as4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Tight_Extreme9776/comments/1k09as4/hoi_an_vietnam/,"Hoi An, Vietnam","Myself, partner, and mother-in-law recently enjoyed a trip to Hoi An, Vietnam, and wanted to share some tips and experiences!

Why Hoi An?

	1.	To find suits for our wedding

	2.	Vietnam is affordable

	3.	The food is amazing

We went in April, and the weather was around 20°C (68°F), which was really comfortable—not too hot or sticky for walking around the streets.

Accommodation

We stayed at an apartment called Hannah’s House (booked via Booking.com). It was very affordable and in a great location—just far enough from the chaos of the main streets to avoid the noise and crowds. Since Hoi An can be quite touristy and busy, this quiet spot was a real plus for us.

  
What to Expect in Town

Hoi An is rather busy, and there are lots of street vendors trying to get you to buy something. You should expect this to happen daily, and after a long day of exploring, it can get a bit consuming and somewhat irritating. It’s definitely manageable, but it’s good to be prepared for the hustle and bustle.

Tailors

There are over 400 tailors in Hoi An, so it can be overwhelming. We did our research beforehand because the experience in-store can be intense, with staff eager to help but sometimes pressuring you to decide quickly.

Tips:

	•	Don’t feel pressured when you first walk in. The tailors will ask what you want and show you tons of fabric options, which can be overwhelming.

	•	Always check the fabric quality and hold it against your body to see if you like it.

	•	It’s okay to say no and take your time to consider your options. We visited several stores before deciding.

A friend and online reviews recommended Kimmy’s Tailor, and they were by far the best experience. The staff were friendly, patient, and walked us through the process without pressure. They even encouraged us to think it over and come back later, which was refreshing compared to other places.

The turnaround time for our suits was impressive, and the quality was excellent. Kimmy’s is a bit pricier than some other tailors but still very affordable, and they use nicer fabrics. I’d highly recommend checking them out!

Food & Drink Recommendations

Breakfast:

	•	Phở Mười – Best pho in town!

	•	K Coffee – A cool, hidden-away coffee spot by the water, away from the main tourist area. It’s very basic and only serves coffee (no food), but the peaceful location made it a favorite for us.

Lunch:

	•	Phở Xưa – We really enjoyed this place and definitely recommend trying the bun cha here.

	•	Vy’s Market Restaurant – Great spot for banh mi and other local dishes, highly recommended.

Dinner:

	•	Pause and Enjoy Restaurant – A fantastic place for dinner with great atmosphere and food.

	•	Bếp Nhà – Another excellent dinner option worth checking out.

Great for Drinks:

	•	7 Bridges Hoi An Craft Beer Taproom – Perfect spot to relax and enjoy some local craft beers.

There are many places to eat and drink but these are a few of our favourites. 

Day Trips & Beach

If you fancy a day out of Hoi An, you must visit An Nhàn - Exquisite Cultural Gallery & Coffee. The owner is lovely, and the coffee is great. He sources lots of local items from across Vietnam and brings them back to his café. It’s almost like a museum, supporting small villages and ethnic minorities across the country. Honestly, it’s a worthy experience and a peaceful escape from the busy town.

If you’re up for a beach day, we went to The DeckHouse An Bang Beach. It was pleasant, affordable, and the food was tasty. There are several places along the beachfront catering to different tastes, but we really enjoyed this spot.

These are just a few of our experiences and hope you may enjoy the same.",1,1744768931.0,u_Tight_Extreme9776,0,1.0,False
1k09aeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteWFHJobs/comments/1k09aeb/plumbing_career_a_day_in_the_life_of_a_pro_plumber/,Plumbing Career? A Day in the Life of a Pro Plumber,"Thinking about starting a plumbing career?

According to Search Lab, plumbers can make up to $93,000/year. It's a career that's safe from fluctuations in the economy and it's a job that AI will not be taking over.

If you've ever had a leaky faucet, a clogged drain, or a burst pipe (yikes), you've probably called in a plumber. But have you ever wondered what a plumber *actually* does all day? Spoiler: it's way more than just fixing toilets.

Whether you're considering a plumbing career or you're just curious about what goes on behind the scenes, this blog post will give you an inside look at a day in the life of a professional plumber — from early morning service calls to those unexpected, emergency fixes that come with the job.

Here's a day in the life as a plumber:

# Day in the Life in a Plumbing Career

Let's go...

# ☀️ 6:30 AM – Early Start, Coffee in Hand

Most plumbers start their day early. Depending on the company they work for or if they’re self-employed, they might begin reviewing service calls over coffee around 6:30 or 7 AM. Jobs are often scheduled the day before, but things can shift quickly if an emergency comes in (think: basement flood, broken water heater, or a busted pipe in the middle of winter).

# 🛠️ 8:00 AM – First Service Call of the Day

The first stop might be a residential home with a clogged kitchen sink or a slow-draining shower. Plumbers assess the situation, diagnose the issue, and get to work. Sometimes, it’s a quick fix — other times, it turns into a more complex job involving pipe replacement or even cutting into walls or flooring.

Pro Tip: Plumbers have to be part detective and part problem-solver. No two calls are ever quite the same.

# 📞 11:00 AM – Commercial Job or Follow-Up Visit

Next up could be a visit to a commercial property like a restaurant or apartment complex. These jobs often involve larger systems, like grease traps or main sewer lines.

Follow-up appointments are also common — such as rechecking work from a previous visit or installing new parts that were on order.

# 🧰 1:00 PM – Equipment Check & Quick Lunch

Lunch is usually on-the-go or squeezed in between appointments. Plumbers often take time to check and restock tools, fittings, and parts. A well-organized truck is like a mobile workshop — it’s essential to staying efficient.

# 💦 2:30 PM – Emergency Call: Burst Pipe!

Not every day includes an emergency, but when it does, it’s all hands on deck. Burst pipes, sewer backups, and failed water heaters don’t care what time it is — they just need fixing *now*. These jobs require fast thinking, technical skill, and sometimes a fair bit of physical strength.

# 📋 4:30 PM – Paperwork, Invoices, and Client Communication

After a long day in the field, there’s still work to do. Plumbers often handle:

* Job notes and documentation
* Invoicing clients
* Ordering supplies
* Scheduling future visits

If they own their business, they may also need to respond to customer reviews, marketing tasks, or employee coordination.

# 🧼 6:00 PM – Clean Up and Clock Out

After removing muddy boots and washing off the day, it’s time to relax — until the next early start or late-night emergency call.

# 🔧 So... What Does a Plumber Really Do?

Here’s the short version:

* **Install and repair pipes, fixtures, and water systems**
* **Diagnose and solve plumbing issues**
* **Work in homes, commercial buildings, and construction sites**
* **Adapt quickly to emergencies and unexpected challenges**
* **Balance hands-on work with technical knowledge**

Plumbers are problem-solvers, essential workers, and yes — everyday heroes with a wrench.

# 💬 Thinking About a Plumbing Career?

If you're considering joining the trade, know this: plumbing is a hands-on, rewarding career with solid earning potential and job security. You don’t need a traditional college degree, but you *do* need strong work ethic, training, and a willingness to keep learning.

And no two days are ever the same — which keeps things interesting.

1k09847,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k09847/aitah_for_missing_my_exs_mums_final_dinner_in_nz/,AITAH for missing my ex’s mum’s final dinner in NZ because of work and finances?,"I (29F) work freelance in the film industry. My now ex boyfriend (33M) owns his own company and employs three of his uni friends, his younger sister (23F), and one junior New Zealand staff member (context to his level of freedom)

Over Christmas, his mum flew over from the UK to stay with us. Before she arrived, I had a conversation with both my partner and his sister letting them know I wouldn’t be able to join in on every activity due to my finances. I hadn’t had any income between July and October due to the lack of work in my area, and was working with a very tight budget. I also didn’t want to burden my partner financially, and was supporting myself 100%. I never missed any rent payments and always contributed my share of the food bills (despite these being more than I would typically spend if I was just feeding myself) We used Splitwise. My partner would pay 50% of the food, and his sister and I would pay the remaining amount - 25% each.

They both reassured me and said, “Don’t worry, Mum will pay for everything.” For context, their mum runs her own successful business and flew business class from the UK. We’re in very different financial positions.

When she arrived, she generously paid for a dinner out and bought a lot of groceries. In response, I started paying for rounds of drinks, expensive pizzas, coffees, etc. obviously, not to the same level, but it was still a lot for me given my financial situation.

Then, a few days later, my partner’s sister added all of the big grocery shops into Splitwise, and their mum also wanted to be reimbursed for the dinners.

So now, on top of the smaller things I’d already covered, I was being asked to pay for expensive groceries and meals I wouldn’t have agreed to if I’d known I’d be billed for them later. We still had two more dinners booked. I pulled out of one because I simply couldn’t afford it. That dinner ended up being cancelled, but the pressure was building. On top of that, I was feeling increasingly guilty — I never would have asked his mum to pay for me, and still wouldn’t, however because my partner and his sister had assured me she would cover things, I had budgeted accordingly.

Fast forward to the night before their mum was flying out. We had another dinner planned. I had just started a new contract in a more senior role I’d never done before. It came with more responsibility and higher pay. This was a massive opportunity for me. On top of that, I was in desperate need of the income this contract provided, so I was doing everything I could to make a good impression. In the film industry, there’s a common saying that you’re only as good as your last job, and I didn’t want to risk my reputation by showing anything less than full commitment.

I was working remotely and our contracted hours were 10.75 hours/day, but I’d been doing 12-hour days to keep up (until around 7/8pm ish) That morning, my boss told me she’d be in a budget meeting until 12pm and uncontactable. I decided I’d wait until after her meeting to ask if I could log off a bit early for the dinner.

I had messaged my boss at 3:30pm about a separate issue and was planning to ask about finishing a little earlier then, but I didn’t get a response. At 5pm, I followed up and asked if I could leave at 5:50pm for the dinner - just ten minutes earlier than contracted hours. Again, no response.

At 5:45pm, my partner’s mum said I was ""A Silly Girl"" for not asking earlier. I explained the situation and suggested they go ahead without me, and then I’d join them around 6:15pm. We’d been to this restaurant before, it’s a 5-minute drive away, and we typically spent the first 30–45 minutes just having drinks and canapés before dinner.

But she said I couldn’t join later, so I told them to go without me. I didn’t want to hold them up, and I was being pressured. They left without me. My partner was mad for days afterward, and later said that this situation was one of the reasons he broke up with me.

I totally understand that he was gutted I wasn’t there on his mum’s last night, and I can see that he wished I’d asked for time off sooner. But I also felt like there was absolutely zero understanding or flexibility from their side about the position I was in, both financially and professionally.

I’d tried to set the boundary about my finances a month (or so) before. I’d contributed way more than I could afford, including booking the restaurant ($12) and budgeting for my dinner ($95 + drink). And still, it wasn’t enough.

1k096ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k096ty/whats_wrong_with_my_tracking_recently/,What's wrong with my tracking recently?,"To preface, I (5'10/M/24) have lost about 95 lbs in the last four years. I started at 252 in early 2021, dropped to 200 by the end of that year, then for the next three years I slowly climbed down to about 185, and then in October last year I decided to really push to finish those last pounds, and now I'm hovering around 154-158. My goal weight for a while has been 152 just so I can say I lost 100 pounds because that's nicer than 95.

In that spurt since October, I have tracked my calories in and out to make sure I'm in a big enough deficit to reach my goal. My tracking obviously isn't perfect but I try to be reasonably close. 

Let's look at my numbers. All weights are weekly rolling averages of daily measurements, which themselves are averages of two morning and nighttime measurements. Calories in comes from my own daily tracking, averaged and rounded to the nearest 10. Calories out comes from my Fitbit, again averaged and rounded. Expected change is how many pounds I would expect to lose that month if my tracking was 100% accurate. And the difference is just the difference between that expected value and how much my weight actually changed, along with what percentage of the expected change that difference was—basically, how off my tracking was.

##October '24

I started tracking on October 7, so this month only includes 25 days of data.

Start | End | Change | Cals In | Cals Out | Deficit | Exp. Change | Diff
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
185.9 | 176.4 | -9.5 | 1380 | 2890 | -1510 | -10.8 | -1.5 (14%)

So, if my tracking was completely accurate, I'd expect to have lost 10.8 pounds but I only lost 9.5. But my tracking obviously isn't completely accurate, so some difference makes sense. No issues here; I was very happy with my progress this month.

##November '24


Start | End | Change | Cals In | Cals Out | Deficit | Exp. Change | Diff
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
176.4 | 169.9 | -6.5 | 1360 | 2740 | -1380 | -11.8 | -5.3 (45%)

This month, I still dropped in weight, but now I was pretty sure there was some systematic issue in my tracking causing my actual loss to lag significantly behind the expected, as my expected loss was near double the actual.

##December '24

Start | End | Change | Cals In | Cals Out | Deficit | Exp. Change | Diff
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
169.9 | 162.6 | -7.3 | 1560 | 2800 | -1240 | -11.0 | -3.7 (34%)

Higher average intake this month but kept my loss steady, and the expected loss was closer to the actual too.

##January '25

Start | End | Change | Cals In | Cals Out | Deficit | Exp. Change | Diff
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
162.6 | 158.9 | -3.7 | 1350 | 2290 | -940 | -8.3 | -4.6 (55%)

My loss slowed this month, which was no surprise to me as I was much less physically active. From October to December, I consistently biked about 3 hours a week (usually 1.5 hours each weekend day), but by late December it was too cold to bike and then in January, my gym closed for renovations. I kept my intake low to compensate (very low in fact, for a couple of weeks I kept it around 1000-1200 which was miserable and I soon raised it to 1400-1500). Here, I realized something was seriously wrong with my tracking as my actual loss was less than half the expected, even though I'd say I was arguably stricter at counting this month than before.

##February '25 

Start | End | Change | Cals In | Cals Out | Deficit | Exp. Change | Diff
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
158.9 | 157.1 | -1.8 | 1510 | 2290 | -740 | -5.9 | -4.1 (69%)

Didn't go outside often this month since much of it was miserably cold, so like January, I exercised very little. I kept my deficit steady but was very disappointed in my actual loss still lagging far behind the expected, especially since I was so close to my goal weight. Around mid to late February, I switched to generally having one large meal a day making up ~80% of my calories as doing so kept me significantly less hungry throughout the day than if I ate several smaller meals.

##March '25

Start | End | Change | Cals In | Cals Out | Deficit | Exp. Change | Diff

157.1 | 155.7 | -1.4 | 1400 | 2300 | -900 | -7.9 | -6.5 (82%)

My weekly average seesawed between 155 and 158 throughout the month, which was surprising as before, it pretty much was a straight downward trend since October and I was still in (what should have been) a good-sized deficit. I generally kept with my one large meal a day program from February.

##April '25 

So far, of course.

155.7 | 156.2 | 0.5 | 1430 | 2480 | -1050 | -4.2 | -4.7 (112%)

I've gained so far this month, but I've also changed the most from previous months. First, I've started going to the gym again, though for lifting, not cardio. I was aiming to start building muscle and improving my physique once I reached my goal weight, but with that taking longer than I expected, I went ahead with it now to not have it be too long without doing much physical activity. I've remained in my deficit, hoping that the extra calories I burn from going to the gym will finally push me toward 152, and again I've generally been having one large meal a day. The difference is that now I am making sure to hit about 120-130 g of protein. I wasn't counting protein before this month but I'd guess before April, I wasn't averaging more than 60-70. But I am still in a deficit that should have me losing weight week over week. I'm guessing my stagnation here is something about the body's response to the activity/diet changes? But that isn't the point of the post.

#Tracking 

What *is* the point is, across these months, my ""deficit"" as tracked is 1100 calories per day. Across 190 days, I should be down around 60.2 pounds (which would make me massively underweight). But I have lost just 29.7 pounds. My tracking is off by about 0.16 pounds a day, which is a whole 560 calories. That's like if I was drinking an extra milkshake each day for the last six months without ever logging it. I am completely fine with my tracking being a little off as there's no way for it to be perfect. But that much for that long? I really don't know at this point.

For calories in, I was a little looser to start with but was still making sure anything I ate was accounted for. I eat out pretty frequently and try to avoid places that don't post their calorie counts, and if I do eat at one, I try to use an upper-end calorie estimate. And recently, if I'm able to bring something home, I started weighing the portion and comparing it to the official"" portion size to get a more accurate count. And when I cook at home (which I started doing more in January), I weigh all my ingredients if I'm not using something packaged that clearly states the amount. I do frequently use zero calorie sweeteners, but since they aren't really zero, just below 5 so they can legally be reported as zero, I recently started counting things like Splenda packets or squirts from Mio bottles as 5 each just to be safe. I recently started counting black/instant coffee and diet soda as 5 or 10 each as well. I count little things like multivitamins, sauces, etc. to the best of my ability. 

And for calories out, I use my Fitbit. I'm sure the Fitbit isn't perfect but it's better than nothing. I've also been adjusting my weight on it so it factors a lower BMR into however it calculates burn. We could assume a certain portion of my calories burned above my BMR are systematically inflated by its tracking. For such purposes, let's take just March and April since my weight change has been small in these months. According to my recorded deficit, I should've lost 12.1 pounds since March 1, but I have only lost 0.9, so in this month and a half, my tracking is somehow off by 870 calories a day. My BMR at 155 lbs is about 1700 (I've hovered around 154-158 in this span and the BMR difference is negligible) and my calories burned in this span is 2350. So if I was in a coma since March 1 while somehow ""recording"" the same amount of calories out and receiving the same amount of calories in, I (well, my doctors) would still have to be overcounting those calories in by 220 each day to account for the discrepancy. I haven't been in a coma. I did some searches on metabolism to see if I could just have a slow metabolism but saw the general consensus among commenters was that metabolism is generally just a buzzword people use to explain not losing as much weight as they should and CICO is all that matters. So I dunno. Can BMR vary significantly between people of the same height/weight/sex/age? (i.e. is it possible my BMR might be much less than 1700?)

I know I'm already at a good weight, but like I said, I just want to drop those last 2-3 pounds to get to that sweet 100 lbs lost—which I should've reached months ago if my tracking wasn't so wrong. Being so close and doing the right things while having my progress significantly slow down recently has been very frustrating. I'm patient and very willing to stay the course. But I still want to figure out how my tracking could be so off for so long, especially if I'm going to start focusing on building muscle and getting into bulk/cut cycles.",1,1744768589.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

There is someone local to me selling their 2.5 year old used Delonghi Dinamica (ECAM35075SI) for $500 on FB marketplace. I know this model is several years old, but it originally appears to have sold for about $1100 new.

The seller is offering to descale for me prior to pick up and is also including 4 filters. I get the impression that these people likely took care of the machine.

I offer tenderness without shame.  
And I will no longer accept  
the role of your guilt’s companion.

Next steps?,"My husband and I celebrated our second wedding anniversary a few weeks ago. For celebrations we usually exchange cards or gifts depending on the celebration. This year, we bought a rental property that we’re currently flipping.

Well, anniversary morning comes and I leave his card on his nightstand before we have our morning coffee together. He freezes and says he feels awful because he didn’t get me a card. He explained he’s been busy with work and renovating the rental property. Which is fair but I also work and help with renovating. I didn’t really say much because I was shocked and felt very lonely at the moment. I said something like, “Well I don’t need to tell you how much this sucks because I’m sure you know already.” We both agreed I wouldn’t bring it up later on and we’d move past it. I said yes in the moment but now I’m regretting my choice. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt by giving him space to still get me a card at a later date or write me a note. Nothing. From the moment we started dating I made it very clear I don’t care about presents and I’d be very happy with a card.

This has been eating away at me for weeks. I’ve been trying to focus on myself more through healthy eating, working out more, listening to podcasts but I can’t help but feel like a fool. Any advice?",0,1744767619.0,RedPillWomen,5,0.33,False

Would you help me to understand how good is a job opportunity to back into the UAE?

It has been almost 4 years I left Abu Dhabi and I have been missing the lifestyle for several years, now that I have the chance to move back again to the UAE I am hesitating it since I am considering it won't be similar to the past in AD.
In order to explain better why I hesitate to move in Dubai, let me sumarize the next:

Current opportunity:
36k AED month + flight allowance
Job place near airport area

In the past:
25k AED m + flight allowance
Job place turist club area
Living in Reem Island by 5500AED/m rent

In the past I was able to commute to work in 15 mins.
I enjoyed a neibourhood where you can walk and enjoy the public areas and take coffee or drinks out with a chill life style.
At the same time, I was saving 12k living with flat mates, car/driving was not needed.

Currently, I am thinking on move on with my wife because we need to save for a future home in Europe but at the same time we are planing to have a decent life without penalties due the savings needs.
Moving together will rise the overall cost in the UAE but at the same time I realise the cost of rent has been rised a lot in the UAE since I left.
At the same time, the neighbourhood near to the workplace don't looks like ofering us a similar lifestyle (the walk/marina looks ideal but it's far away and next to airport I only know the Deira/gold souk area next to it)

Where should I look for apartment with a reasonable lifestyle and commuting time within taxi or metro?
It's realistic to consider savings of an amount between 18/20k based on an european leisure lifestyle with no kids?
I understand it's a lot of money but currently I already have a good role in Europe so if the difference is not significant this movement has no sense.

We both know Dubai is like Disneyland for adults and how easy the expending can be spiked up by leisure weekends. But we use to balance it, not every weekend is a party or great brunch but a regular dine out with friends.

Any help or tip is very welcome!!

Everyone in the flat has another address they go to sometimes except me. I also struggle with an eating disorder and sometimes completely freeze up if someone comes in the kitchen when I'm there, I've managed to improve with that recently and can usually either take a lot of deep breaths or just leave the room.

Anyway, I got an email recently saying multiple complaints had been made about me including ""threatening behaviour, being generally unclean, improper food waste disposal allowing pests into the flat and tampering with others' food and cutlery"". I spoke with one of the other people in my flat and she told me that the other two people were offended by the times I wasn't able to move in the kitchen, and that one of them had said I'd made some sort of passive comment when he was nearby and he decided to send a really long ""scathing, petty email where he really had a go at me"" (apparently those were pretty much his exact words) essentially blowing everything out of proportion, claiming I was using his cutlery and tea towels without any sort of proof, she said the ""improper food waste disposal"" was because I spilled some coffee (keep in mind there are no pests in the flat, I've only seen one or two flies in the past month or so and they probably just came in through the front door).

I'm not sure where to even start with the second person, since he moved in he's just seemed to have it out for me? For example, the first time I ever really saw him I was standing in front of his cupboard (didn't know it was his cupboard at the time), instead of asking me to move he just shoved me into a wall. There was another time I was near the fridge and he just walked in, said nothing about wanting into the fridge and just opened the door so wide he hit my head with it. As well as this he's started incoherently yelling at me so many times when I've been in the kitchen, which usually ends up with me crying due to the combined stress of his shouting and having to have a meal, then he just starts calling me a baby. He's also chased me into my room when I've been trying to carefully carry something downstairs. I never reported him just because I don't like the concept of being an adult and filing petty complaints against people. Then on Friday I came back from uni and he immediately started shouting claiming I ""put sauce on his wraps"" then just showed me some wraps with sauce on them. We're not actually sure what that was about but we suspect he just did it himself to try and blame me for some reason? Or he could've just knocked the sauce over accidentally, not noticed and assumed it was me. Anyway he started threatening to call the police on me saying they would ""find my fingerprints on his wraps"" and I'm guessing he went and complained too and that's what the ""tampering with food"" part was about. 

The entire flat received an email about all of the issues mentioned above with threats to fine us, involve our universities or terminate our contracts if there are any more issues, which I find absolutely insane considering two of the people aren't even around that often. I received a separate email saying the complaints made had been about me and that my uni has been notified.

Honestly this whole thing is just scaring me, I'm going to be staying in another flat next year but it won't be free until the end of June so I've been looking to see if there's anywhere I can go until then, I've also contacted my uni's student support team to see if they can offer any advice but I really don't know what to do, this is my only address and it feels like if I do anything that even slightly irks one of those two they can just get me kicked out, I've also been given some good opportunities at uni recently and don't want to lose them. Yes the person I was speaking to can vouch for me and say the person who sent the email told her it was all lies/exaggerations but that's still only two of us against two of them and the others aren't in often enough to be involved at all, not that I'd want them to be as they haven't done anything wrong.

For context: I (21F) go to university about 20 hours from my hometown. My boyfriend (21M) lives 5 hours away from my hometown, so we are long-distance no matter where we are.

Basically, this past holiday season, I went home for a month for winter break. My boyfriend and I had made plans for him to come visit me the week before Christmas since we hadn't seen each other in 2 months. My friend, ""Stacy"" (22F), and I hung out a lot while I was home, and I had told her how excited I was to see my boyfriend on multiple occasions. 

  
The day that my boyfriend came to my city, Stacy texted me asking to hang out. I told her I couldn't, because my boyfriend was there. She said okay, and we moved on. A few hours later, a mutual friend, ""Alice"" (21F), texted a groupchat with Stacy and me, asking if we wanted to go out for dinner. I replied to the text and declined, explaining that my boyfriend was with me. Alice said he was free to join us if he wanted to, but I said no because I didn't want to impose, plus I just wanted some 1-on-1 time with him. 

  
Stacy called me immediately after I sent that text and asked me why I wasn't going to dinner with them. I restated all my reasons, and I told her that I would love to go the next weekend if they wanted to. She got upset with me, saying that I was choosing my boyfriend over my friends. 

  
Now, this is the part where I may be the AH: I told her that it wasn't fair of her to say that when she consistently bails on all of us at the last minute to go on various dates. I also said that I would rather spend time with my boyfriend, who I haven't seen in 2 months, than go out with them and get drunk for the 4th night in a row.

  
She hung up on me after I said that, and that was that. After my boyfriend left a few days later, I texted our groupchat and asked them if they wanted to get dinner that weekend since I was free. Nobody responded to me. I sent another (unrelated) text a few hours later, and they responded to that one. Then, I resent my question about the dinner plans because I figured they had just been busy earlier and hadn't seen it. Again, nobody responded. I realised that they may have been upset with me, so I texted Alice privately asking if everything was okay. She said that she was fine, but Stacy had been complaining in a separate groupchat, calling me an AH and saying that I didn't care about my friends.

  
I hadn't spoken to Stacy since then, but this past weekend, I went home to visit my family, and I figured I would reach out. I invited her out to grab coffee and talk, but she didn't respond.

My wife and I are heading to Maui for our honeymoon — we’ll be staying at the Grand Wailea for 6 nights.

A couple of things about us:
	•	I love snorkeling. Looking for great recommendations and tours 
	•	My wife loves acai bowls and great vegetarian-friendly food.
	•	We’re both coffee lovers.
	•	Her birthday falls during the trip (April 19), so I’d love suggestions for something special — maybe a memorable dinner or experience? I have already booked a sunset cruise and dinner at hotel wailea. anything else?

Any recommendations for:
	•	Romantic beaches and scenic spots.
	•	Snorkeling tours (beginner-friendly and ethical).
	•	Vegetarian/vegan restaurants, acai bowls, and coffee shops.
	•	Unique birthday experiences in Maui.

We've hung out four times. Each for hours on end. I've flirted with her a little by calling her beautiful and said she looks good and she was wanting to hangout more and longer after that. She complimented me multiple times in person very specifically about my personality and asked if I wanted to get lunch with her and reached out to professors on my behalf unwarranted making sure there's spaces in classes related to my culture. And playfully teased me in person.

We got coffee and I texted her (I'm still beating myself up over this) ""We still on for that coffee date today?"" (I didn't frame it as a date when i asked her for coffee in person. She said ""coffee yes. Date no."" And so we got coffee and it wasn't awkward at all. We were talking a lot and she wanted me to sit next to her, not across. She asked if I have eaten I said no and I asked if she wanted to get lunch and we extended the hangout by getting lunch. 

On the way back before she went to class I said ""I didn't mean to make things awkward between us by calling this a date"" and she said ""no you didn't make it awkward at all!"" then I said 

""I just wanted to be honest about my intentions and feelings. I like you."" And I looked over at her and it seems like she was blushing and said ""Thank you"" and before she went to class we just looked at each other smiling for a bit not saying anything then wished each other a good day. 

  
I'm really confused about everything and feeling lost. I don't know if there's romantic interest or not. I don't know if I should follow up over text asking for clarity.",5,1744766040.0,dating,7,0.86,False

26M, originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and I’ve just started my life as a truck driver here in Texas. Everything’s so new the wide open roads, the BBQ joints, even the way people say “y’all.” Sometimes I feel like I’ve landed on another planet, and I could really use some friendly faces to help me feel at home.

A little about me:
	•	On the road: I spend most days behind the wheel, so I’m always chasing sunsets across state lines. But when I’m parked for a few days, I’m all about good company.
	•	Music junkie: My playlist jumps from Congolese soukous and Afrobeats to classic country and modern hip‑hop. If you’ve got song recs, I’m all ears!
	•	Easygoing vibes: I love cracking jokes, sharing stories, and just kicking back—whether that’s over coffee, a cold beer, or a road‑trip snack fest.
	•	Cultural explorer: I’m fascinated by Texas traditions y’all have the best fairs, rodeos, and hidden‑hole‑in‑the‑wall spots. Teach me your favorite local hangouts!

I’m hoping to meet new friends who don’t mind a guy with a thick accent and a million “first‑time-in‑Texas” questions. Ladies, if you’re up for showing a curious Congolese guy around or just swapping stories about life’s little surprises, let’s chat.

We had an incredible 3+ days getting to know your city via its food and people, and we can’t wait to be back! 

Hope it’s ok to leave our review of where we went and what we had, with a five year old in tow, we were wondering if any of the places we picked would be unsuitable for kids but soon found out that wasn’t the case in most places!

1. Homeslice: Clam Pizza, sausage pizza, cheese pizza (our 5+ year old loved this), and the cannoli (everyone loved this!) 

Edit: I knew I forgot something: Italian Sub (my husband inhaled this!) 

Shoutout to our server Hayley, she was incredible! Homeslice also has great activity pages and a free doughball for littles to get into while waiting on food!  

2. Uchibā: Hiratsuki Ceviche Special with granita, smoked mackerel, Tasmanian trout, engawa and kinki sushi, and our favorite dish of the entire trip - the Fried Milk dessert - we loved this so much we went twice in three days to get our fix. 

Kid friendly menu: we loved that the kids menu was so well thought out - our daughter loved the pork belly bao, pumpkin tempura and avocado maki.

Service here was fantastic - we had Tristan and then Breezy on our second visit and both times they took such good care of us! 

3. Odd Duck: Thai Sweet Potato & Pork Belly salad, chicken hearts mole (incredible), cast iron cornbread and the Wagyu burger (we shared this and our daughter had the kids version with a full fledged 8oz Wagyu patty of her own. 

Service was also top notch here, JP was our main server but everyone who helped bring out the dishes was just so lovely, friendly and kind. 

4. Ramen Tatsuya on Lamar: 
Loved this as a simple last-day lunch, super easy to get to and a nice way to end our stay after days of eating our way through our trip! 

Our picks: Tsukemen, Pork Belly bowl, Munchie Katsu

5. Merit Coffee: Fantastic matcha latte, croissants and donuts (all recommended by the baristas) for our flight home 

======••=======

Suerte: I hesitate to include Suerte here but I will since it came recommended and the glowing reviews here hard to ignore! Hopefully my review here will spare another family who isn’t that sure about whether to include Suerte on their list. We spent ordered a lot of what was recommended, (the ceviche, the tjaluda, the tres leches) but only felt the Suadero Tacos were worth mentioning. Other items we tried were heavy handed with some sort of vinegary aftertaste (the guac, papas were quite sour), oddly-paired incompatible seasoning (duck flautas mole), and sadly, the service here was the worst we had all trip. 

We were unable to flag anyone down or find our server during the second half of our meal which was when our meal started to go downhill. At no point were we ever asked how the food was, how everything was and it was quite disappointing but perhaps we went on an off day. 

======..======

That said, overall we really enjoyed Austin from the first day, and look forward to coming back again! Thank you again for the many solid recommendations on this sub!! ",34,1744765337.0,austinfood,10,0.9,False

It’s got a built-in grinder, decent pressure, and seems beginner-friendly without feeling too basic.

But this model has been around for a while — is it **still worth buying in 2025**? Or is it outdated at this point?

A few things I’m wondering:

* Does the steam wand make good enough microfoam for lattes?
* How reliable is it long-term — does it last a few years with regular use?
* Would you recommend it for someone who wants to learn but also get consistently good espresso?",1,1744765320.0,Appliances,1,1.0,False
