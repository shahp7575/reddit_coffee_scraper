Lets dive in.



I have a 2020 mazda 6, removing the windows control panel is relatively easy but you will need some plastic prying tool.



Insert the tool at the bottom of the plastic trim and pull up, it will be a bit difficult so don't be afraid to give it a go (of course don't break the dam thing).



Once the bottom is out, use the tool to shimmy from the sides and gently pull up and towards the back of the car.



Once out, put the control vertically for cable removal as there is not much slack.



Next, remove the control assembly, just pull the clipping part of the pin outwards, it should come off easily.



If you have a heat gun, use it on low setting to get the curved edges right.



I am still figuring out how to do the bends and curves that are under the buttons.

**Why This Pick?**

The Diamondbacks starting Eduardo Rodriguez (6.06 ERA) should provide plenty of opportunity for the Phillies to score some early runs. Rodriguez‚Äôs last 5 starts have seen his opponents put at least 4 runs on the board; 3 of those 5 starts saw his opponents bag 7 runs or more. While I do think this will be a high-scoring affair, the Phillies should do most of the heavy lifting (especially with All-Star Ranger Su√°rez making his season debut). Take Philly to put at least 5 runs on the board in this encounter.

I will be travelling to Europe in August solo for the first 3 weeks and then meeting up with family and travelling together for the next 3 weeks. I will be visiting Lisbon, Porto, Seville, Madrid and Florence alone. 

I had gastric sleeve surgery around 5 years ago. As a result, i cannot drink any liquid 20 mins before or after eating and can eat around  1 cup of food (e.g 4 pieces of sushi or half a small burger or 1 apple or 1 entree) in one go. If i eat too much, or drink close to eating, i feel so sick.

I wanted advice about eating out for lunch and dinners in the aforementioned places. I eat out regularly where i am from and just get leftovers each time. I like to try different things so normally order 2 dishes and eat a little of each. 

My questions are:

If I don't finish my food, will that be taken okay? I have had staff worry in the past that I didn't enjoy the meal, when in reality im just full.

Will I generally be able to take any leftovers? 

I don‚Äôt usually drink anything (like coffee, wine, or water) when I go out to eat, as it makes me too full. I'd prefer then to not pay for water since I won‚Äôt drink it. Will that be an issue?

Do you think it will go down well if i ask for a main and entree to come out at the same time? That way i get to eat a bit of both before getting full.

1kecmy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kecmy6/lever_or_flow_control_espresso_machine/,Lever or Flow Control Espresso Machine Recommendations [$3000],"I am looking to upgrade my espresso experience at home! I currently have a Flair 58 and it has been wonderful over the last 3-4 years I have been using it. Before that, I had a Barista Express, which started start my espresso journey 7 years back. My grinder is a DF64 v2 with SSP Espresso burrs. Barista Express taught me the basics and then the Flair 58 helped me learn even more while experimenting with different techniques.

Even though it has been awesome, I'd love to make my morning routine easier while still having a hands on, fun experience. I also want good milk steaming capabilities so I can make some milk drinks for my partner. I'd prefer this to be my end-game machine that I do not have to upgrade for a very long time, so longevity is also a factor.

**Drink Type:** I generally make straight espresso, cubanos or americanos while my partner drinks iced lattes (mostly because I do not have a consistent milk steaming method, or else she would have lattes or cappuccinos). If I could do milk drinks, I would throw in a cortado every once in awhile.

**Frequency:** I make 4 double shots every day, quad shot for my partner and I make 2 double shots I enjoy throughout the morning. Then I love making coffee for friends and family when they visit. 

I do not have space limitations. I would consider myself an average experience level. I feel very comfortable in my routine but I am definitely not a pro. Just a guy that loves coffee and trying to get better.

**Few Machine Considerations (Open to Other Recs as well):**

*Lelit Bianca:* It has flow controls that will be much easier to control than the Flair 58, it looks awesome, and it seems to have decent steaming capabilities.

*Profitec 700 with Flow Control:* I like this one because it is a highly rated machine that had flow control added onto it.

*Profitec Pro 800:* I have been looking into lever machines because it is similar to the Flair 58 but it makes it much easier to use. I love that I do not have to fill the chamber will water each pull and I still get the hands on feel. Currently my top contender.

*Bezzer Strega:* Seems similar to the Profitec although I have not done as much research.

I love making coffee and want to get a setup that makes me love it even more! Thank you in advance for your thoughts.",1,1746337407.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

We matched on Bumble, which is a miracle in itself because I live in a tier 3 city where dating apps are pretty much a desert. I moved back here three months ago, and honestly? Dating has been terrible. The men here barely know how to hold a conversation. I‚Äôd almost given up.

But then *he* happened.

We matched and hit it off instantly. Within the first hour of chatting, he asked me out for coffee. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much, but I said yes.

And damn! Best first date I‚Äôve had here. We talked for hours. Laughed, shared traumas, bitched about people‚Ä¶ everything just *clicked*. There was this spark I hadn't felt in ages.

The second date? He took me out on a bike ride. He‚Äôs such a bike lover, and that joy just radiates off of him when he talks about it. That day felt like a scene from a movie wind in my hair, smiles all around, and that feeling you get when you realize, ‚ÄúOh wow, I‚Äôm *really* enjoying this.‚Äù

Then came the third date. He randomly called and told me to get ready he‚Äôs coming to pick me up. My heart leapt. I got ready faster than ever, ran downstairs, and off we went on another ride. The weather? Perfect. The kind of perfect that feels unreal. And yes‚Ä¶ we made out. And oh boy, probably the best make-out session I‚Äôve had in a *long* time.

But like all good things, it had to end. He lives in London and was just here visiting family. He‚Äôs leaving in two days. I might never see him again.

And you know what? That‚Äôs okay.

I‚Äôm not writing this as a rant or a vent this is just me, sharing a beautiful memory. It was the kind of weekend that makes you believe in little miracles. The kind that restores a bit of faith in people.

Oh and he‚Äôs active on Reddit. He knows about this account.

*Hi K!* If you‚Äôre reading this, thank you. I hope you get everything you‚Äôre working toward. I‚Äôll always remember you and these three days with a full heart.

Thank you for giving me a story worth remembering.

I have a father, but after I turned ten, maybe eleven, it's never been the same. I find myself trying to fill the void by looking into careers that he'd be impressed or proud of, looking into music he plays, I even started drinking coffee in the morning because we get ready at the same time and it's a moment where we are together, even if we dont talk.

Ive been unknowingly trying to fit myself into a box that I thought he'd like, and still nothing works. I just want to feel seen and I don't know what to do with myself because such a large part of my identity now is influenced by what I thought he'd want me to be, to the point that eventually it turned into something subconscious. My studies, my career path, my attitude, my music taste, interests, it makes me feel stressed even thinking about it. 

But then instead, I find myself getting attached to people who do somewhat resemble father figures. And it's the same story all over again, I get all invested about getting their approval, and when they leave, whether permanently or not, it feels like a major hit to my mental, and I start getting anxious and jittery about what I did wrong.  

I don't know, I just want a fucking hug or something for a change. ",2,1746337044.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

Throughout the week we texted a lot, asked questions about each other, and seemed to have a lot in common. In general he responded pretty quickly even if at work. Yesterday morning we finally went on a coffee date and it went well. Later in the day he got off work early and asked if I wanted to go to dinner. We went out to dinner, it also went well, we talked for like 3 hours until the restaurant closed. We then went across the street and got ice cream. We sat outside but it slowly got a little awkward and quiet. We kind of ran out of things to talk about and it was super cold, dark, and windy. We then agreed to leave since it was late. We hugged and departed ways. About 40 minutes later when I got home I sent a text saying I had a great time, and apologized if it was awkward I was just a bit tired/had brain mush after a long day, but if he wanted to go out again we could do a fun activity like bowling. He read the text, but didn't respond. I figured it was just late. Earlier this afternoon, still no response, so I sent him a meme about a tv show we both liked. Also left on read. I thought maybe he was at work and mentioned he had family in town this weekend. Fast forward to now at 10:30pm and I'm writing this Reddit post lol. I am a bit thrown off because he mentioned many many times a red flag he finds in a person is lack of communication and how important communication is for him. Am I being ghosted? I thought he was genuinely nice and I finally met someone who was mature enough not to just ghost :( I understand not being interested, but being left on read while ghosting is insane work.

Problem - grind sizes vary a lot between different roasters and i have observed that the finer the grind the stronger and more flavourful the coffee. For eg - savor works's boss wife.  Its a lot coarser than most other moka pot grinds and the resultant Coffee in a moka pot is very weak and underextracted. So i put the one dose of ground coffee in a normal mixer jar and ground it up finer. I made coffee with thia finer grind and the coffee now tastes very nice. The problem is that the grind is too fine for the moka pot and the moka pot sputters even with 2 aeropress filter papers(one in basket, one in the top filter). 

Some finer ground coffees like panduranga trio blend come out very nice and tasty. But that's  a blend and that has chicory, so cant really compare.  Same issue with blue tokkai pre ground for moka pot. Too coarse and weaker brew. 


Question- will getting a grinder like the timemore c2s and grinding my own coffee fix this issue? Will the timemore be able to dial in grind size to get proper extraction or will it still be coarse and weak? The grind size that got me tasty coffee was power like, So im assuming that its anyway too fine for a moka pot, so even if timemore can grind that fine, the moka pot wont be able to brew it without sputtering. Should i just take the leap and buy both a grinder and an espresso machine? Or should i try timemore first? Please help. So confused and lost.  ",1,1746336893.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

1kecg4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/vidanta/comments/1kecg4d/vidanda_riviera_maya/,Vidanda Riviera Maya,"Hello all,

Some friends of ours bought a voucher for a week at one of the following resorts... They do not want to use it and we can buy it from them for $500. 

The options are:
Hacienda Encantada Los Cabos 
The Grand Mayan Nuevo Vallarta 
The Grand Mayan Riviera Maya

Judging by the photos and reviews, the Grand Mayan Riviera Maya seems the best.

$500 for a week there sounds like a steal.  

However, I started reading this reddit sub and now I'm second-guessing it. 

So we're starting with $500.. plus we'll have to upgrade to a bigger room because we're a family of 4. The rep I spoke to didn't give me availability or actual pricing because the voucher is not under my name yet... But they suggested that it would probably cost $899 for the week, to upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite, if available. 

So now we're at $1399. Then I'm hearing that there are resort fees of a couple of hundred. So $1599. 

I'm reading that they charge for water or coffee... Among other things. That the rooms are old. That the resort is huge and if you're on the wrong building then you're far away from everything.. that if you don't do the pushy timeshare presentation then you won't have access to some of the pools or facilities... 

And I can't help but think... Is this better than booking a regular hotel of our choosing for maybe $2000? 

I'm trying to think of this purely from a value for money perspective.. but one thing that makes it even worse is that I can't help but think that our friends paid a lot more than $500 for this voucher and I'd feel oblidged if we take it from them at a discount.. I would do it in a heartbeat.. but it sounds like it's not such a great deal anyway in this case. 

Am I wrong? Could it be that the resort is as great as it actually looks and people are being a little picky because they hadn't read about all these extras and were not prepared?",1,1746336622.0,vidanta,1,1.0,False

The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock
By T. S. Eliot

S‚Äôio credesse che mia risposta fosse
A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,
Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.
Ma percioche giammai di questo fondo
Non torno vivo alcun, s‚Äôi‚Äôodo il vero,
Senza tema d‚Äôinfamia ti rispondo.

Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming question ...

Oh, do not ask, ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù
Let us go and make our visit.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
And seeing that it was a soft October night,
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

And indeed there will be time
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
There will be time, there will be time
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
There will be time to murder and create,
And time for all the works and days of hands
That lift and drop a question on your plate;
Time for you and time for me,
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
Before the taking of a toast and tea.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

And indeed there will be time
To wonder, ‚ÄúDo I dare?‚Äù and, ‚ÄúDo I dare?‚Äù
Time to turn back and descend the stair,
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair ‚Äî
(They will say: ‚ÄúHow his hair is growing thin!‚Äù)
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin ‚Äî
(They will say: ‚ÄúBut how his arms and legs are thin!‚Äù)
Do I dare
Disturb the universe?
In a minute there is time
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.

For I have known them all already, known them all:
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
I know the voices dying with a dying fall
Beneath the music from a farther room.
               So how should I presume?

And I have known the eyes already, known them all‚Äî
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
               And how should I presume?

And I have known the arms already, known them all‚Äî
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)
Is it perfume from a dress
That makes me so digress?
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
               And should I then presume?
               And how should I begin?

Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...

I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!
Smoothed by long fingers,
Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet ‚Äî and here‚Äôs no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.

And would it have been worth it, after all,
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
Would it have been worth while,
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
To have squeezed the universe into a ball
To roll it towards some overwhelming question,
To say: ‚ÄúI am Lazarus, come from the dead,
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all‚Äù‚Äî
If one, settling a pillow by her head
               Should say: ‚ÄúThat is not what I meant at all;
               That is not it, at all.‚Äù

And would it have been worth it, after all,
Would it have been worth while,
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor‚Äî
And this, and so much more?‚Äî
It is impossible to say just what I mean!
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
Would it have been worth while
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
And turning toward the window, should say:
               ‚ÄúThat is not it at all,
               That is not what I meant, at all.‚Äù

No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
Am an attendant lord, one that will do
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,
Deferential, glad to be of use,
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous‚Äî
Almost, at times, the Fool.

I grow old ... I grow old ...
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.

Shall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.

I do not think that they will sing to me.

I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
When the wind blows the water white and black.
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.

1kecdwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoCodeCommunity/comments/1kecdwo/how_does_printify_work/,How Does Printify Work?,"Have you ever dreamed of running your own online store without the hassle of managing inventory, dealing with shipping logistics, or investing thousands upfront? If so, you've probably heard whispers about this magical thing called ""print-on-demand"" and maybe even the name ""Printify."" Well, you're in luck because today we're diving headfirst into the world of Printify and breaking down exactly how it works.

I still remember the day I stumbled across print-on-demand while browsing online for side hustle ideas. The concept seemed too good to be true‚Äîdesign products, sell them online, and have someone else handle all the production and shipping? Sign me up! After trying several platforms, Printify quickly became my go-to for its ease of use and versatility. Whether you're a seasoned entrepreneur or just getting started, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how Printify works.

# What is Printify and How Does Print-on-Demand Work?

Printify is a print-on-demand platform that connects merchants (that's you!) with a global network of print providers. But what exactly does ""print-on-demand"" mean? Unlike traditional retail models where you need to purchase and store inventory upfront, print-on-demand means products are only created **after** a customer places an order.

Print on demand (POD) is a business model where products like t-shirts and books are created only after a customer orders them, saving you from managing inventory. It's a low-risk way to start a business or test new products, with services like Printful and Printify handling production and shipping.

Here's the beauty of it: you don't pay a penny until someone buys your product. No more gathering dust in your garage or worrying about unsold inventory. Printify handles order fulfillment so merchants can focus on growing their brand. When a sale happens, Printify handles everything from quality control to reprints and refunds without you needing to do a thing.

This business model has exploded in popularity for good reason. It offers an incredibly low barrier to entry for aspiring entrepreneurs, artists, content creators, and anyone looking to monetize their creativity. The print-on-demand market is projected to reach a whopping $48.4 billion by 2032, making now the perfect time to jump in!

# Getting Started with Printify: Step-by-Step Process

Getting your Printify business off the ground is surprsingly straightforward. Let me walk you through the exact steps to go from zero to having your first product ready to sell:

# 1. Create Your Printify Account

First things first‚Äîhead over to Printify .com and sign up for a free account. You'll need to provide some basic information to get started, but don't worry, there's no credit card required for the free plan. I was pleasantly surprised by how quick this process was‚Äîtook me less than 2 minutes!

# 2. Explore the Dashboard

Once you're in, take some time to familiarize yourself with the Printify dashboard. It's intuitive and user-friendly, with clear navigation to all the essential features. The main sections you'll be using are:

* **My Products**: Where all your created products live
* **Catalog**: The full range of blank products available to customize
* **Orders**: Track and manage customer orders
* **My Stores**: Connect and manage your sales channels

# 3. Choose Your Products

Printify offers over 1,300 top-quality products, including apparel, kitchenware, home decor, pet products, and more. Browse through the catalog and select items that align with your brand or niche. The variety is seriously impressive‚Äîeverything from the expected t-shirts and hoodies to more unique items like custom shoes, jewelry, and even pet beds!

When I first started, I made the rookie mistake of trying to offer too many different products. Trust me on this one: start with 2-3 products you're excited about and expand from there.

# 4. Connect to Sales Channels

Before or after creating products, you'll want to connect Printify to your preferred sales channel. Printify is integrated with multiple platforms that not only simplify printing on demand but also offer marketing and online services to facilitate your online business. You can choose from Shopify, WooCommerce, Etsy, eBay, Wix, PrestaShop, or BigCommerce and more.

Each platform has its own advantages:

* **Shopify**: Great for building a branded store experience
* **Etsy**: Perfect for reaching customers already looking for unique, custom products
* **eBay**: Enormous existing customer base
* **TikTok**: Newer integration perfect for social selling

The integration process is typically just a few clicks through each platform's app store or through Printify's ""My Stores"" section.

# Designing Your Products: The Creative Process

This is where the fun really begins! With your products selected and store connected, it's time to bring your creative vision to life.

# Using the Product Creator

Printify provides a free Product Creator, full of beginner-friendly tools, to design the products of your dreams. The interface is drag-and-drop, making it accessible even if you have zero design experience.

I vividly remember sitting at my kitchen table, sipping coffee, and spending hours playing around with different designs on my first batch of products. There's something incredibly satisfying about seeing your ideas come to life on a physical product‚Äîeven if it's just a digital mockup at this stage!

# Design Resources and Tools

Printify offers several ways to create designs:

Printify's Product Creator offers free use graphics for quick and easy product customization. We also provide an AI Image Generator and Shutterstock integration to take you from designing to selling in a few clicks.

Don't feel limited to Printify's built-in tools, though. Many successful merchants use external design software like Canva, Adobe Photoshop, or even free alternatives like GIMP to create their designs before uploading them to Printify.

# Design Tips Based on Real Data

Wondering what types of designs actually sell? Data reveals that consumers appreciate clean designs on print-on-demand products, avoiding clusters of artwork on their items. Products with a single design element dominate 56% of all eligible sales, closely followed by products with two design elements at 24%.

Keep it simple! The most successful designs typically have:

* 1-2 design elements (not cluttered)
* 1-5 color options (black and white designs are consistently popular)
* Clear, legible text if used
* Image elements rather than just text or patterns

# Understanding Printify's Pricing and Profit Margins

One of the most attractive aspects of Printify is its pricing structure‚Äîor rather, the lack of mandatory fees just to use the platform.

# Free vs. Premium Plans

Using the Printify platform is free of charge. You can integrate your sales channel and publish as many designs in your store as you want. There is also a Premium plan available that gives you a 20% discount on all products, which can significantly boost your profit margins as you scale.

When I first started, I used the free plan to test the waters. Once I was consistently making sales, upgrading to Premium was a no-brainer‚Äîthe discount more than paid for the monthly fee.

# How Production Costs Work

Product and shipping costs are billed only when a sale is made in your store. Each product has a base production cost, which includes:

* The blank product itself
* Printing of your design
* Basic packaging

Shipping costs are additional and vary based on:

* Product type and weight
* Destination country
* Selected print provider
* Shipping method

# Calculating Your Profit

Your profit is simply the difference between your selling price and the combined production and shipping costs. The average profit margin is 40-50%, but there are more opportunities for specific products.

For example:

* Production cost for a t-shirt: $8
* Shipping to customer: $4
* Total cost to you: $12
* You sell for: $25
* Your profit: $13 (52% margin)

Pro tip: Don't underprice your products! Many beginners make this mistake, thinking lower prices will lead to more sales. In reality, higher prices often convey higher perceived value‚Äîjust make sure your product quality backs it up.

# The Print Provider Network: The Backbone of Printify

Unlike some other print-on-demand services, Printify doesn't actually print anything themselves. Instead, they've built a network of printing partners worldwide.

Printify doesn't own the production process, nor does it print on the products. Instead, the company acts as a middleman between you and various printing companies. All Printify products are outsourced to print providers of your choice, each with its own print quality and shipping costs. The print providers have different ratings, leaving it up to you to decide which ones will work for your online store.

# Selecting the Right Print Provider

When creating a product on Printify, you'll be able to choose from multiple print providers based on:

* Location (important for reducing shipping times and costs)
* Production techniques offered
* Product variations available
* Price points
* Quality ratings from other merchants

I learned this lesson the hard way‚Äîafter initially choosing providers solely based on the lowest price, I had a few quality issues that led to customer complaints. Now I always balance cost with quality ratings and location.

# Print Provider Locations

Printify's network includes providers across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. By selecting providers closer to your target customers, you can:

* Reduce shipping costs
* Decrease delivery times
* Minimize international shipping complications

This global network is one of Printify's biggest advantages, allowing you to sell worldwide without worrying about international fulfillment logistics.

# Order Fulfillment and Shipping Process

The magic of print-on-demand truly shines when it comes to order fulfillment. Here's exactly what happens when a customer buys one of your products:

1. Your customer places an order through your connected store (Etsy, Shopify, etc.)
2. The order details are automatically sent to Printify
3. Printify routes the order to your selected print provider
4. The provider prints your design on the product
5. The finished product is packaged and shipped directly to your customer
6. Both you and your customer receive tracking information

All of this happens without you lifting a finger! Once you make a sale, Printify's Print Providers take care of order fulfillment while you focus on marketing, designing, and making money.

# Production and Shipping Timelines

Typical production times range from 2-7 business days, depending on the product and provider. Shipping times vary based on destination and shipping method, but generally:

* Domestic (same country): 3-8 business days
* International: 1-3 weeks

Some print providers offer express production and shipping options at additional cost, which can be worth it for time-sensitive orders or during holiday seasons.

# Real-Life Example: My First Printify Sale

I'll never forget the excitement of my first Printify sale. It was a simple black t-shirt with a minimalist design I'd created for dog lovers‚Äîjust a line drawing of a dog with the text ""Dog Hair: The Original Glitter"" underneath. Nothing groundbreaking, but it resonated with my target audience.

The notification pinged on my phone while I was having dinner with friends. I excitedly showed everyone at the table, probably boring them to tears with my enthusiasm over selling a single t-shirt! But that moment was magical‚Äîproof that this business model actually worked.

The entire process, from order to delivery, was completely hands-off. Three days later, I received an email that the shirt had been delivered to my customer in California (I'm based in New York). A week later, they left a 5-star review with a photo of them wearing the shirt. Talk about a dopamine rush!

# Pros and Cons of Using Printify

Like any platform, Printify has its strengths and limitations. Let's be honest about both:

# Pros of Printify

* **No upfront investment**: Start selling without purchasing inventory
* **Extensive product catalog**: Over 1,300 customizable products
* **Multiple print providers**: Choose based on location, price, and quality
* **Integrations with major platforms**: Sell wherever your customers are
* **Free basic plan**: Test the waters without financial commitment
* **AI design tools**: Create professional designs even without design skills
* **24/7 merchant support**: Help when you need it

# Potential Challenges

* **Quality variations between providers**: Need to test providers to find the best
* **Limited control over shipping**: Dependent on provider shipping speeds
* **Customer service reliance**: Must rely on Printify's support for order issues
* **Print area limitations**: Can't always print on entire product surface
* **Learning curve**: Takes time to master all features and options

Some merchants report challenges with customer support, noting there's no direct customer service line, only ""activities"" that you open for online chat help. However, many others report positive experiences with the support team.

# Success Tips for Printify Entrepreneurs

After working with Printify for years and speaking with numerous other successful merchants, I've gathered these key tips for maximizing your success:

# 1. Start with Focused Product Offerings

Even if your first sales flop, stick with the checklist, adapt your efforts, and watch your online store take off. Publish frequently and a lot‚Äîat least ten new products each week. Simplicity is key: stick to 1-2 design elements and 1-5 color options.

# 2. Order Samples

Always order samples of your products before selling them to customers. This allows you to:

* Verify print quality
* Check sizing accuracy
* Take authentic product photos
* Identify any potential issues

The small investment in samples can save you headaches and negative reviews down the road.

# 3. Use High-Quality Mockups

Printify provides mockup generators, but consider creating lifestyle mockups that show your products in real-world settings. These convert much better than basic product images on white backgrounds.

# 4. Price for Profit, Not Volume

Don't fall into the trap of underpricing your products. Calculate your costs carefully and price for healthy profit margins. Remember, you're selling unique designs, not competing on price with mass-produced retail items.

# 5. Build Your Brand

The most successful Printify merchants don't just sell random products‚Äîthey build cohesive brands with consistent design aesthetics, targeted marketing, and engaged communities.

# Conclusion: Is Printify Right for You?

Printify offers an incredible opportunity to start an online business with minimal risk and investment. The platform handles all the complex logistics of product creation and fulfillment, allowing you to focus on design, marketing, and growing your brand.

Is it perfect? No platform is. But for aspiring entrepreneurs, artists looking to monetize their work, content creators seeking merch options, or established businesses wanting to expand their product lines without inventory headaches, Printify provides a powerful solution.

The best part? You can start for free, test the waters, and scale as you grow. So what are you waiting for? Your print-on-demand journey awaits!

I've been seeing this guy for a few months and we've spent the night together several times. One night while I was there and we went to bed, he kept rubbing his feet together. For several minutes his was just rubbing them together until he fell asleep, I guess. The next morning I asked him about it and he said that he has some type of restless leg syndrome, and that it's also kind of a self soothing, unconscious thing that he does.

I didn't think too much of it and it's happened a few more times when we've been together but I didn't really pay it much attention. Last night I was at his place and we were in the living room watching a movie on the couch. We were sitting upright with our legs on the coffee table and as the movie progressed he started rubbing his feet together, but I didn't really notice. That was until he moved his feet to the floor and sat up slightly away from me, then threw up all over his feet/the floor. I didn't know what to do or if he had an upset stomach or anything, but when I asked if he was okay he said he was fine. At this point he was still rubbing his feet together. 

I was in shock - but he just went back to watching the movie like nothing happened. I sat there for another few minutes and then again, he threw up directly onto his feet and started rubbing them together again. 

I was so put off that I got up to leave and he asked me what was wrong and I didn't know what to say so just told him I was going to go back to my place. 

He's texted me a few times today but I haven't responded because I have no idea what to do/say. In my brain I feel like this can't be even remotely normal or apart of some unconscious habit?

I love doing this in coffee shops during the day, but given most close around 8pm in the centre, I wish there were similar places that were open late into the night. 

Restaurants are an option, though feel more high-stake and less relaxed, plus factoring in having to purchase a full meal over just a coffee or cake. That, and I feel like having a laptop out in a restaurant isn't socially acceptable.

I imagine Wetherspoons is a realistic option, but ideally I'd love to hear any other ideas.

I never left her side, sat there in dirty closes and eating nothing but vending machine coffee for days.

My wife was diagnosed with stage 4 renal carcinoma about six years ago which she has been fighing hard to keep at bay. Last night we found out she has large tumor behind her left eye and a few leisions in her brain (the cancer is in every organ and her bones too now.)  She has developed aphasia because one of the tumours is just touching the speech center in her brain. The spot is so small they find it hard to believe it could be affecting her speech but she didn't decide to get aphasia for fun, it hits her more so when she's tired and its hard for her to get the words out. They are in her brain they just won't come out right from her mouth.

After six years of fighting this she has been given 3 to 6 months. I don't even why I am writing this out. I guess I just feel lost. She is my life, everything I have done over the past 17 years of us being together was to make her happy. I am 47 (she is 51) and my brain can't process the thought of not having her around. She got very sick about three weeks ago (first case of aphasia and lost 80% of her strength over night) but before that other than her weak leg and having to use a cane you wouldnt know she was sick.

I told my boss I have to leave and stay by her side until the end. He understood and told me there is a place waiting for me when I'm I want to come back. Not that I wouldn't  bankrupt myself to get one more hour with her. Money is going to be tight but I only need enough to get her though this and then I no longer need to worry. I don't even think i will survive her passing. My heart is already weak and to be honest I wouldn't mind at all if I passed away at the exact same time she did. That way I can go looking for her in whatever comes next.

What is getting me is all I can think about is wanting to switch places with her. I can't get the thought out of my mind. She is the most amazing woman in the universe and she doesnt deserve this. I want it to be me..I would give anything for it to be me.

Anyways I just needed to get this out. I love her so much and those people that keep telling me to just put her in a hospice center and keep going with my life are pissing me off. She made me promise years that I wouldn't take her to a hospital to die. She wanted to pass at home when the time comes and not only will I keep that promise I will stop anyone that tries to take her away from her home.

At the hospital the doctors kept saying I could go home and they would call me as they found out more. I hated going down the hallway to go to bathroom and leave her alone for two minutes.

Again I am sorry for making this so long or even typing it out to begin with but I need to do something..I have slept maybe 30 hours total in the last three weeks and my brain won't relax..So it probably doesnt even make sense.

Thank you for being here to let me vent my soul. For anyone else out there going through this I am with you and for cancer patients out there never stop fighting. My wife was told five years max, we are halfway through year six and she is still here. So never stop fighting, after watching my wife fight this and taking to other cancer patients I have to say that people with cancer seem to have a strength I wish I had even a tiny bit of.

So, as many people probably say - I don't feel like I am or was an alcoholic, though I drank a lot more than I should. I wasn't a drinker who drank himself into a stupor or blackouts, but if I had a beer there was a good chance I was gonna have another... and most likely another. 

That would happen multiple days per week... sometimes weeks at a time. 

Before continuing, I will say I did have moments where I felt like ""I needed a drink"" after a stressful day, or when life threw me lemons, but I also drank because I enjoyed it. I like to have drinks with friends, at concerts, at social outings, and while unwinding. To not drink in those situations was foreign to me.

I probably tasted booze for the first time when I was very young. My dad was a drinker and there were those crazy times in the early 80s where I'd say, ""Dad, can I hold your beer?"" He'd say ok and I'd sneak a sip or two. Then there were the high school years where my friends and I would always find a way to get alcohol for parties etc. I would say that I drank semi-regularly from the time I was 15 or 16 through May 2, 2024. 

I will say that I had stretches of time where I didn't drink over the years. Times where I'd give it up for Lent or take a few weeks to dry out etc, but I would always fall back into it. I'd say my longest stretch without a drink was during the Covid shutdowns...while many hit the bottle hard, I stopped drinking on February 13, 2020 and didn't have another drink until August of that year. 

That's when I got a little out of hand. I hit some kind of doldrum...maybe it was lockdown, maybe it was life, maybe it was just the gravitational pull of the bottle. I'm not sure, but I started drinking a lot more often. I'd sit on my back patio and put away multiple beverages. Didn't matter if it was a Monday or a Saturday. 

If it ended in ""Y"" it would play. I'd listen to songs, go through the emotional swings that come with those moments and then do it again the next day. I gained weight, I felt like crap a lot of the time, wasn't sleeping well and just felt down. 

You tell yourself that you're drinking because of your mood, but the mood is truly being effected by the drinking. Sure, you feel a bit better once the buzz rolls in, but you end up feeling worse - most of the time before you're even through with the last beverage of the evening. 

I have had a bad stomach - one of the only things my dad seemed to give me - and that featured acid reflux, Gerd and digestive issues in general. I have used prescription medications - Nexium etc - and over the counter stuff to help the cause. I would alway pop tums and other antacids following my fun. 

That takes me to May 2, 2024. My partner was out of town for business so I did a few chores around the house following work and went down the street to a local place for dinner and a few drinks. I didn't drink much, probably three beers. I had a sandwich and some wings. After that I came home and sat down for some patio time. I lit the fire pit, had a few more drinks and turned in for the night. 

I felt buzzed but wouldn't say I was drunk. 

I woke up that night with terrible acid and took some tums etc. That subdued the issue for the time being. I woke up the next morning at 4:30AM for work, started making my coffee and felt the acid. I took some Prilosec and immediately didn't feel well. I felt my mouth watering and made a move for the bathroom because something wasn't right. I ended up throwing up what looked like some blood. I am still not sure that is what it was, but it scared me. 

I decided I needed to take a break. A long one. I don't think I intended to stop drinking forever, but the calendar started rolling along. I made it through concerts, parties, holidays, fantasy football drafts and even a trip Vegas. The pre-May 2 me would have been throwing back multiple drinks on all of those occasions - but especially on vacation. But I didn't... 

It wasn't easy. I conditioned myself to think you pretty much had to drink when you did all those things. It enhanced the time, it somehow made those events better. It was even harder because adults bring the peer pressure more so than any teenager I ever dealt with. ""You're not drinking? What?! Come on, just have one shot, we're all doing one!"" and on and on. 

Then again, I was probably the jerk who was harassing my friends about having a drink in the past.

That made me feel a bit guilty but that's something I'll deal with later. 

That said - here we are. I made it a year. I can't honestly say that I went a year without a drink in probably 35 years? That's insane. 

That all brings me to today. I went 365 without having a drink. I will admit that I have probably had 10 NA beers as I experimented with finding something to stir in while hanging with friends or when I missed simply having a drink, but I really don't like them, so it's a rarity. (I know there are small amounts of alcohol in those, which is OK since I didn't decide to go total straight edge - however I am probably close). 

I would be lying if I said that I don't miss some of my favorite drinks, but I am moving on without them. I don't feel light years better, but I feel a lot better. I didn't lose a ton of weight, but I have lost some and am continuing to work on getting back to better shape. And I am damn proud of myself for making it to this point. 

I am sorry to blow into this sub with a long read, but I have been stealth following it for several years and I knew this group would be one of the few places that would understand. 

Thanks for reading... and keep on swinging! If I can do it, so can you... here's to 365 more days. ",3,1746335621.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

**All of my scrunchies started going missing when I met my boyfriend**



About a month ago I became official with a guy named Tim. Tim is great, really responsible, honest, has a good career, etc. So far our relationship has been great aside from the fact that since I met him, my scrunchies started going missing.

It sounds stupid, I know, but I always stash scrunchies throughout my apartment. I use them every day and like them to be easily assessable. I have some in my bathroom, both of my bedrooms, my living room, my car, etc. I probably had 20+ scrunchies randomly disbursed throughout. I‚Äôm down to 6, three of which were in my car. At first I thought maybe I just lost one or two, but before long I noticed that entire stashes were missing. It‚Äôs gotten annoying because anytime I go to reach for one, it‚Äôs just gone. For example, I have a drawer under my sink where I had kept around 5 scrunchies (sounds crazy, but I tend to take them, tie my hair back, do something else, and take it out in a different room. This assured me I will always have one on hand in the room I usually need them most. I return 5 to this stash on Sundays when I clean if they got moved). The drawer now has none.

The only factor in my life that has changed is my boyfriend. My dog doesn‚Äôt bother them, but even if she had somehow gotten into drawers and taken to eating them, we‚Äôd probably be in the pet ER right now because 14 scrunchies is quite a lot. I don‚Äôt think anyone is breaking in to steal my scrunchies. I KNOW I haven‚Äôt lost this many.

Is my boyfriend secretly a ferret? What could he possibly be doing with all of these scrunchies? My friends are joking that he has a shrine of me in his closet. One friend thinks that he‚Äôs stealing them to test if I notice when things go missing and has plans to steal more which has me sort of sketched out. He‚Äôs never in my apartment alone, but he‚Äôs somehow finding enough time to be alone to do this and for me not to notice. Does anyone have any ideas? I was going to confront him, but I don‚Äôt want to accuse him of something so silly. But I also just don‚Äôt get it. Help!!

Edit:

Some of y‚Äôall just aren‚Äôt any fun. OBVIOUSLY no one but him knows. I just wanted to preemptively prepare myself for reasonings as to why he could be doing this. Also, it‚Äôs just kind of funny so I wanted to share. I thought the way this was written would kind of show that, but some people are taking it wayyy too seriously.

He‚Äôs planning on coming over tonight, so it‚Äôs definitely on the agenda to inconspicuously ask him where they‚Äôve gone. At this point if he says he doesn‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm just going to set up a camera because A) he‚Äôs lying and needs called out or B) SOMEONE unwelcomed is in my apartment stealing my stuff. Someone asked if it could be my dog, but I‚Äôve pulled my couch out since this has started happening and honestly my dog doesn‚Äôt really steal things, so I‚Äôm 99.9% positive it‚Äôs not her. She‚Äôs an old gal and just sleeps mostly. Unless there‚Äôs some other creature sneaking in and stealing, it‚Äôs definitely a persons doing. A lot of people have said he might be tidying them up, but this is honestly impossible because they‚Äôre NOWHERE to be found. I have a fairly large apartment, but unless he‚Äôs storing them in a vent or something, they‚Äôre just straight up missing. Either way, I should have some update tonight!

*I'd very casually say ""Have you seen my pink scrunchie? I swear I left it right here."" If he says no, say something about being concerned about your landlord and thinking about putting a security camera inside.*

**heftybetsie**

*Next, gaslight even further. Start stealing and throwing away his underwear so he thinks the landlord is after HIM.*

**Update - 1 day later**



Y‚Äôallllll. He just left and I have to write this now while it‚Äôs fresh in my mind.

So, as many of you came at me for not doing immediately, I had a talk with him tonight. I had planned on it, but when I discovered the last batch of missing scrunchies this morning, I snapped and just wanted to get some ideas of what he could be doing with them. I didn‚Äôt want to approach it via text or while either of us were working, so I figured I‚Äôd just wait till this evening to approach him. A lot of people told me that I should be able to talk to him, but it‚Äôs still so new I just didn‚Äôt want to approach it at first.

Most of you were wrong, but a few of you beautiful, twisted people got it right. Without further ado, allow me to provide my best recollection of the conversation:

Me: I keep losing my scrunchies and it‚Äôs driving me nuts, have you see any of them around? Him: Not really, don‚Äôt you have one on your night stand? Me: yeah, but I used to have A LOT more and now they‚Äôre missing. It‚Äôs so weird.

At this point his demeanor kind of changed. To be fair I was staring him down and he knew I knew. He just shrugged at me. The demeanor switch gave me enough of a spidey sense that I just flat out asked them why he was taking them. He initially tried to say that he didn‚Äôt, then he tried to say he was accidentally taking them and said he would put them on his wrist and forget to take them off. I pressed him saying I never saw them on his wrist and I always kiss him good bye so I would notice. He looked like he was about to start crying and kept saying he didn‚Äôt know, which didn‚Äôt make sense because he clearly did. I got frustrated and raised my voice and demanded to know, at which point he admitted he was masturbating with them. I just kinda stared at him and for a second I was glad that I made the post because the initial shock wasn‚Äôt as bad since it was brought to my attention that this is‚Ä¶. Common? I had him explain and he said that one night early on he was at my place and we had made out but I told him I didn‚Äôt want to have sex. He shimmied away to the bathroom and had looked around for something to use as lube. I only had scented lotions around and he was worried I‚Äôd notice that he smelt like them, so he chose the next best thing which I guess was my ultra plush towel scrunchie. After he defiled my poor scrunchie, he apparently panicked and rinsed it out and put it in his pocket. I guess this experience ignited something within him, because he started taking them to masturbate with. When I asked why he didn‚Äôt just keep up with the same one and wash it or buy his own pack, he said that it felt better because it was mine. Cute‚Ä¶ I guess?

He told me he would never take another one and apologized profusely for being weird. He even offered to buy me new ones. While he wasn‚Äôt as manipulative or scary as some people thought, I still don‚Äôt love that trust has been broken so early on and that he stole from me, regardless of reason. I asked for space and he left. So yeah, I don‚Äôt really know what I plan to do from here, but now we all know! Apparently scrunchies of your loved one feel REALLY good if anyone wants to give it a shot‚Ä¶ with permission of course ;)

*Wait what we need all the tea on the others with these nicknames*

>OOP: Okay okay, here‚Äôs the rundown:   
  
‚ÄúBodies in the river‚Äù   
  
My first boyfriend, broke up when I was 18. Guy was really weird and gave off serial killer vibes, but never towards me so I was naive and let it go. Right before we broke up he talked about killing his dad and co workers. Said he was a sociopath and never even loved me, was just used to me. I gingerly ended things and called the police. (He also hit me around this time which was a no-go for me.) One specific thing that happened was us going to walk around a river in our city and he said something to the effect of ‚ÄúI wonder how many bodies are in there‚Ä¶ bet a lot of people went missing and ended up in there and were never found.‚Äù NOPEEEE.  


>‚ÄúLaxatives in your pasta guy‚Äù  


>Dated this guy a year after. Started off weird because he pressured me into dating him by walking girls around my work (I worked at a coffee shop) and telling me how in demand he was and how valuable his time is. I again, was naive and dated him. He started cooking for me a few months in, which I thought was cute, but I was constantly sick and he would gaslight me and tell me I wasn‚Äôt actually sick, just being dramatic. Ended up going to a doctor that evaluated me for an eating disorder and accused me of taking laxatives all of the time based on symptoms I had shown. I told him I never did that and he started evaluating me for domestic abuse. Turns out the guy was putting laxatives in my food to make me sick. Don‚Äôt know why, but I recently met his other ex girlfriends who had the same symptoms, so he‚Äôs still going strong. He also bought me a vape and encouraged me to start vaping telling me it was 0 nicotine juice. I found the bottle and it was actually salt nicotine and was SUPER high, I can‚Äôt remember the ‚Äúdosage‚Äù, but definitely not 0. He just liked getting people to ingest things I guess? This guy still trash talks me to all of our home town, which people are happy to tell me about in modern day.

Squirrel guy:  


>I have a deeper recount of this on my page since it was sort of recent, this is also ‚Äúleft me behind in a mass shooting‚Äù guy. Just to touch on both of those, I helped an injured squirrel and this guy sat me down with his father who degraded me and called me names because of it. We were also at a place where a mass shooting took place and he took off and pushed me away from him when I tried to catch him.

Blockchain. The word itself carries a significant weight, often immediately conjuring images of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and volatile markets. While its role in powering digital currencies is undeniable, focusing solely on crypto vastly undersells the revolutionary potential simmering beneath the surface. You might be wondering: beyond the hype and the headlines, what *truly* transformative applications does this technology hold? What is the **most exciting potential use of blockchain technology** waiting to reshape our world?

That's the core question we're diving into today. We'll move past the common cryptocurrency associations to explore several groundbreaking areas where blockchain could make a profound impact. This post will explore leading contenders for the title of ""most exciting use,"" examining how blockchain could revolutionize everything from the products you buy to the way you prove your identity. Get ready to discover the future, unchained.

# Why Look Beyond Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin demonstrated blockchain's power for secure, decentralized peer-to-peer transactions. It proved that we could establish trust and transfer value without a traditional intermediary like a bank. This was, and still is, revolutionary.

However, the underlying technology ‚Äì the distributed, immutable ledger ‚Äì has capabilities far exceeding just digital cash. Its core strengths include:

* **Transparency:** Transactions can be viewed by participants on the network (to varying degrees depending on the blockchain type).
* **Immutability:** Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it's extremely difficult (practically impossible) to alter or delete.
* **Security:** Cryptographic hashing and decentralized distribution make the system resistant to tampering and single points of failure.
* **Efficiency:** By removing intermediaries, processes can often be streamlined and automated using smart contracts.

These characteristics make blockchain a powerful tool for solving problems related to trust, transparency, and security across countless industries. Focusing only on crypto is like looking at the internet and only seeing email ‚Äì useful, but just the tip of the iceberg.

# Contender 1: Revolutionizing Supply Chains

Think about the journey of a product you bought recently ‚Äì perhaps coffee, electronics, or medication. Can you trace its *entire* path from origin to your hands with certainty? Likely not. Traditional supply chains are often fragmented, opaque, and susceptible to errors, fraud, and inefficiencies.

**This is where blockchain offers transformative potential.**

Imagine a global supply chain where every step ‚Äì from farmer harvesting beans, to the shipper transporting them, to the roaster preparing them, to the retailer stocking them ‚Äì is recorded on a shared, immutable blockchain ledger.

* **Enhanced Transparency:** Consumers and businesses could scan a QR code and see the product's verified journey, combating counterfeiting and ensuring ethical sourcing.
* **Increased Efficiency:** Paperwork is reduced, approvals can be automated via smart contracts, and tracking becomes near real-time.
* **Improved Accountability:** If a problem arises (like contamination), pinpointing the source becomes much faster and easier.
* **Reduced Fraud:** Counterfeit goods, a multi-billion dollar problem, become significantly harder to introduce into the legitimate supply chain.

For its ability to bring unprecedented trust and visibility to the complex web of global trade, **supply chain management** is a strong contender for blockchain's most exciting use.

# Contender 2: Securing Digital Identity (Decentralized ID)

How many times have you had to prove who you are online? You rely on usernames, passwords, and providing sensitive personal data to countless companies, creating centralized honeypots vulnerable to breaches. Your digital identity is fragmented and largely controlled by third parties.

**Blockchain enables a paradigm shift towards Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI).**

With decentralized identity systems built on blockchain:

* **You Control Your Data:** Your identity credentials (like driver's license details, educational degrees, professional certifications) are stored securely in a digital wallet *you* control, not on a company's server.
* **Verifiable Credentials:** You can share *only* the specific piece of information needed for verification (e.g., proving you are over 18 without revealing your birthdate) through cryptographically secure, verifiable credentials.
* **Reduced Risk of Breach:** Since data isn't stored centrally, large-scale identity theft breaches become less likely.
* **Enhanced Privacy:** You decide who sees your data and when.

Imagine logging into websites, applying for loans, or verifying qualifications without cumbersome processes or sharing excessive personal info. **Decentralized identity** puts control back in the hands of the individual, making it a profoundly exciting and empowering blockchain application.

# Contender 3: Transforming Voting and Governance

Trust is the bedrock of democracy. Yet, election integrity and transparent governance remain persistent challenges globally. Concerns about vote tampering, accessibility, and opaque decision-making processes erode public confidence.

**Blockchain offers potential solutions for more secure and transparent democratic processes.**

* **Tamper-Proof Voting:** Recording votes as transactions on a blockchain could make them immutable and publicly verifiable (while maintaining voter anonymity through cryptographic methods), drastically reducing the potential for fraud or manipulation.
* **Increased Accessibility:** Secure digital voting could potentially make participation easier for remote or disabled citizens.
* **Transparent Governance:** Blockchain could be used to record government decisions, budget allocations, or public consultations in a verifiable and transparent manner, increasing accountability.

While significant hurdles (scalability, regulation, digital divide) exist, the potential for blockchain to fundamentally enhance trust and participation in **voting and governance** makes it a deeply compelling use case with far-reaching societal implications.

# Contender 4: Innovating Healthcare Records

Your medical history is often scattered across different doctors, hospitals, and clinics, leading to inefficiencies, potential errors, and difficulty accessing your own complete health picture. Sharing this sensitive data securely is also a major challenge.

**Blockchain could enable secure, patient-centric healthcare record management.**

* **Unified, Secure Access:** A patient's medical records could be cryptographically secured on a blockchain, with access controlled via private keys held by the patient and authorized providers.
* **Improved Data Integrity:** Immutability ensures that records cannot be tampered with easily.
* **Enhanced Interoperability:** Authorized doctors could access a more complete patient history (with patient permission), leading to better diagnoses and treatments. *(Potential external link opportunity: Cite a health informatics organization on data interoperability standards)*.
* **Patient Empowerment:** Patients gain more control over who sees their health information and when.

Facilitating secure, efficient, and patient-controlled **healthcare data management** is another incredibly exciting potential application, promising better health outcomes and increased privacy.

# Other Promising Blockchain Applications

The potential doesn't stop there. Other exciting areas include:

* **Intellectual Property (IP) Management:** Creating immutable records of ownership and usage rights for creative works or inventions.
* **Real Estate:** Streamlining property transactions, title transfers, and record-keeping.
* **Tokenization of Assets:** Representing real-world assets (like art, stocks, or commodities) as digital tokens on a blockchain, enabling fractional ownership and easier trading.
* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** While related to crypto, DeFi aims to rebuild traditional financial services (lending, borrowing, trading) in a decentralized manner, removing intermediaries. *(Potential internal link opportunity: Anchor text ""Learn more about Decentralized Finance"")*.

# Challenges and the Road Ahead

Despite the immense potential, it's crucial to acknowledge the challenges:

* **Scalability:** Some blockchains still struggle to process high volumes of transactions quickly.
* **Regulation:** The legal and regulatory landscape for blockchain applications is still evolving.
* **Energy Consumption:** Proof-of-Work blockchains (like Bitcoin's) consume significant energy, though newer consensus mechanisms are more efficient.
* **Complexity & Adoption:** Understanding and implementing blockchain solutions can be complex, hindering widespread adoption. *(Potential internal link opportunity: Anchor text ""understanding blockchain fundamentals"")*.

Addressing these hurdles is key to unlocking blockchain's full potential.

# Conclusion: So, What's the Most Exciting Use?

Determining the single ""most"" exciting potential use of blockchain technology is subjective and depends heavily on individual priorities.

* Is it the potential for **global supply chain transparency**, combating fraud and ensuring ethical practices?
* Is it the promise of **self-sovereign identity**, giving individuals unprecedented control over their personal data?
* Is it the possibility of **transforming democracy** through secure and verifiable voting?
* Or is it the innovation in **healthcare**, leading to better patient outcomes and data security?

Each of these applications, and others we've touched upon, holds the power to fundamentally reshape industries and aspects of our daily lives. Perhaps the *most* exciting thing isn't a single application, but the sheer breadth and depth of blockchain's **transformative potential** itself ‚Äì its ability to build new systems based on trust, transparency, and decentralization. The future of blockchain is still being written, but its potential reach extends far beyond its cryptocurrency origins.

I am really hoping I can get some advice in here, but the catch is that we have a LOT of restrictions.

Okay, now for what I like and would love to find ways to incorporate‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm trying to be a bit more minimalist. The visual clutter (a lot of which wasn‚Äôt fully captured in the pics) overwhelms me. However, a lot of it is also displayed lego sets my boyfriend and I built, that ideally would still be out post-makeover, although I may be able to convince him to pick a few favorites and cut down a little. Yes, paradoxical.
Right now, I LOVE plants, green + moody colors, and natural wood grain. Antique or interesting ovens make my heart ache I want one so badly. My boyfriend is a huge lego lover (yes, I have almost every plant themed set, not put together yet) and we also both love star wars, so I‚Äôm open to tasteful ways to incorporate those!

Ideas:
I currently have a lot of seedlings lining my windowsill, but once I have them planted in a garden, I‚Äôm considering getting more lush plants in their place to bring life in. The coffee station in the back isn‚Äôt a part of the apartment, and it‚Äôs unsealed wood so I‚Äôm considering painting it a nice sage or olive color. I‚Äôm torn on replacing the Christmas lights with fake ivy, fairy lights, or just taking them down in general. We are wanting to get one more throw pillow for the couch, so open to suggestions there (can replace the gray one for matching, but the sunflower stays‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs my favorite)- maybe curtains? Although those might be more trouble than they‚Äôre worth, and I don‚Äôt want to block my access to my plants. Lighting looks terrible in pics, but actually is generally really good, although some sort of string light in the living room has helped.

Filter ne literal chamatkar kiya tha. Pics aur asli zindagi ka koi connection hi nahi.



Fir bhi manners dikhaye maine. Popcorn liya, movie dekhi, chalo sab theek.

Lekin movie ke baad bolti hai:

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to your flat.‚Äù



Mann mein socha ‚Äì Flat? Behen mai ek to aakle rhata hu aur area k aunty log CCTV! ü§£

Bola: ‚ÄúFlat nahi yaar, chalo hotel chalte hain‚Ä¶ yahan log dekh lenge.‚Äù

Thoda confuse bhi ho gaya bhai, itni fast?



Uske baad bolti hai:

‚ÄúMujhe shopping kara do, kapde lene hain.‚Äù

Maine bola: ‚ÄúArey, online order kar deta hoon, tu khud choose kar lena, mall me bhid hoti hai.‚Äù

Kehti: ‚ÄúChhodo, fir chalte hain.‚Äù



Phir ACHA SUNO wali line ayi ‚Äì

‚ÄúAgar shopping nahi kara rahe ho toh GPay hi kar do.‚Äù



Maine poocha: ‚ÄúKitna?‚Äù

Boli: ‚ÄúWaise 5‚Äì6 hazaar ka hota hai mera shopping.‚Äù

Aur pehne thi bolna nhi chaunga bhai. ü§£

Andar hi andar mai hass bhi raha tha, lekin samajh gaya scam chal raha hai.



Phir maine clearly bola:

‚ÄúLook, I don‚Äôt pay for sex. I came because we were talking for weeks, and I don‚Äôt meet people casually. This feels wrong.‚Äù

Seedha nikal liya wahan se bol kar ek kaam karo kuch kha lete hai food court me and fir aapne aapne ghar jate hai and she said no so i said its ok then Bye. üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è



Thoda emotional blackmail bhi try kiya usne, lekin mai firm raha.

Bhai, BACH GAYA.

Later realize kiya ‚Äì pura setup scam tha, emotional + financial lootne ka plan tha. Now Blocked and never go again.



Moral of the story:

Breakup ke baad vulnerable mat ho bhai



3‚Äì4 weeks baat karne ka matlab kuch bhi nahi hota



Pehli date sirf PUBLIC place



‚ÄúShopping kara do‚Äù ya ‚ÄúGPay kar do‚Äù = SCAM ALERT üö®

So I have struggled with same sex attraction since I was a teenager and while I have mostly not acted on it in a romantic sense, I have spent a lot of my teenage years and early 20s participating in queer culture (watching queer movies and tv shows, reading queer books and comics, listening to queer music, going out to gay clubs, pride, and other queer events, and even hosting them). I thought all of this was harmless because I wasn‚Äôt necessarily engaging directly in homosexual acts. But I was still supporting it and basically saying it was okay with my actions. 

It has taken a while but I have now realized how I was rooting my identity in being queer instead of rooting it in being a child of God. Over the years I have gone back and forth about leaving behind all my LGBTQ+ hobbies and activities that usually draw me into other sexual sins and generally pull me away from God. However, I recently got the chance to travel for a few months and being away from everything allowed God to show me how I don‚Äôt need these things in my life. The problem now is that I‚Äôve come back from traveling and I still have people in my life who (for lack of better phrasing) knew the old me and have a relationship with me where I support queer lifestyles and culture. 

I don‚Äôt want to get sucked into queer culture again but I also don‚Äôt want to randomly drop my friends without any explanation. One friend in particular is lesbian, dating a woman and very active in the queer community and my conversations with her usually bring up things related to being queer. I‚Äôm thinking of getting coffee with her and telling her that I‚Äôve changed my position on queer culture. What is the most charitable way for me to go about this? I also have a friendly coworker who is also a lesbian in a relationship, also very active in the queer community. We‚Äôre not as close but friendly at work and she often brings up things related to queer life. How can I also bring up that I no longer want to talk about these things busy still care about her as a person and coworker? 

I know I‚Äôm going to have to have a lot of hard conversations, but my main question here is: Is there any way to have these conversations without the whiplash and without causing hurt and making people feel like I‚Äôm betraying them out of nowhere?

SO reddit it is.

Hey, F, idk if you'll ever read this, and if you do, hopefully you won't know it's me, and if you actually do know, then I'm glad you are finally getting to know this, because I've been wanting to TELL you this for as long as I can remember but never actually had the courage to.

I met you when I was 12, back in 2017, I was obviously young and knew nothing about love other than Disney movies and daydreaming about one day getting married and getting to reach the point of the so called ""happily ever after"". You were 14 at the time we met, we went to the same english school together though we were in separate classes, I have absolutely no memories on how we actually became friends, but I know that right after that, you showed me the love I always dreamed of, and there are moments I genuinely will never ever forget about us that you probably has already forgotten since for you it probably didn't even matter.

It is stupid silly, but you were the very first boy to ever show me a romantic affection even though we never actually even dated. You were my very first long warm comforting romantic hug I felt, and I would give everything to feel the way I felt in your arms again, and I would never ever let it go this time, and oh I so much regret when you were going to hug me like that (not knowing it would be for the last time) and I somewhat refused because I was stuck in my own stupid world in my mind thinking you didnt like me when it was so obvious that you did like, and really, really liked me. I would give everything to go back to that moment and just jump into your arms.

I remember silly moments of us listening to music together, even though it was cringe 2017 anime and Rick and Morty songs. I also remember when I had terrible period cramps for the very first time in my life and I sat in a corner thinking you weren't going to see me or even care to look for me but you actually did care, and you paid very close attention to every small spot in the room even though it was full of people, and when you saw me you made a silly pose like you always did, resting your arms on your waist and slightly bending your knees while turning your head sideways with such a goofy smile. You came walking towards me and immediately gave me a hug and I knew what home felt like when it wasn't a house.

I remember when it was my 13th birthday, my mom took me to one of the best restaurants of the country, it was in our city and happened to be very close to the english course we used to go, and I couldn't stop thinking about how I was going to be late for """"""class"""""", all because I wanted to see you, my mom was so mad because I kept insisting I wanted to go to """"class"""" while she wanted me to just skip since my grades were good and enjoy my day with the family, but all I wanted to do was see you. And when I got to the school, we bumped into each other like a super cliche movie moment and I almost melted when I was speaking with my friend about it, especially because she saw it happening and she too adored it.

I remember when every single time, my friend would make sure to say out loud how cute we were together and how much she shipped us and adored us, and how you would smile and somewhat blush, and for whatever reason, I still thought you didnt like me.

I remember when you held my hand for the very first time in the car while my mom gave you a ride back to your place, it was warm, and soft, and I was so happy you did that. I kept insisting to give you more rides so we could do that more often, but you were always busy afterwards so it never happened. And once I finally managed to, you didn't hold my hand, and I felt my heart hurting a little bit and wondering what I had done wrong.

I remember when you kissed me for the very first time, we were texting about kissing each other for weeks and weeks but we never did it, I was too scared since it was my first kiss. When I had the chance to initiate it, I immediately gave up, but then you went ahead and leaned over to kiss me, it was quick, not even a second long, but it meant the whole world to me and I'm so happy you were my first kiss.

I remember when my cat died, and how all I could think about was how much I wanted to see you even though I did not go to the same english school as you anymore, but even so, I still went there, just so I could get some comfort from my favorite boy, and I was so right to go there, because you managed to make me smile when I was slowly diving into a bit of a depression in my life.

I remember, when you went to my place for the first time and how awkward it was because of how terrible my family is regarding boys, we had to stay downstairs in the living room where we had absolutely nothing to do, it was weird, but we still managed to just talk and use our phones to show each other memes and songs. You even showed me a love song actually- and yet, I still thought you didn't like me.

I even remember your ""love you too"" texts- yet, still the same thought, of course you didn't like me.

Then, not long later, 2018, I moved away.

We slowly stopped talking

You were never good at texting

And I thought you never cared.

We both lived our lives individually, but never actually stopped thinking about one another.

There are so many memories that I keep in my heart, and I still don't understand how I thought you never liked me. I only found out you did when YOU told me that you used to like me, on my 16th birthday, when you and I already had our own partners at the time, and I broke down crying because of how stupid and dense I was. How did I not realize that? HOW? I'm 20 now, and sometimes I still cry because of this thought. The thought of ""what we could have been"" haunts me.

Sigh.

So many things happened after that. I messed up And it would take me thousands and thousands of paragraphs to explain, so I won't do that.

But, there we were, 3 years later, I went back to the city, like I do every year, and I saw you again, we went to a cafe together to catch up on our lives. You looked different, and you sounded different, and yet you were somehow still the same, and gosh I was so happy to see you again after so long, all I wanted to do was jump into your arms, but I knew that if I did, you wouldn't have caught me. We were not close friends anymore, to be honest, not even truly friends, we were just two strangers who used to know one another, and yet you still gave me a chance to meet again for a sip of coffee (even though neither of us drink coffee but the phrase sounds nice)

We talked, and we laughed, and I listened to stuff about your career even though I still don't really get it, but gosh you looked absolutely beautiful talking about what you love and know. It was enchanting. You were enchanting.

After that day, I got desperate.

I kept thinking about you 24/7, I was not going to stay in the city forever, only 2 months, I was desperate to see you again.

I kept trying to talk to you and invite you to do things and to go to places so many times, but you would be either busy, or tired, or sometimes you just forgot, and gosh that hurt.

Then, I did it. We went to the movies together. I was so nervous. I wore the outfit I bought and I looked so cute for you, I did my nails even though one of them was hurting at the time. I also was trying my so very best not to actually throw up because of my anxiety, and I was just praying that I was going to be able to at least hug you again, to feel that warm comforting hug for maybe the very last time, and feel like home the way I kept in my heart and mind for years. Well... I... did hug you, but it wasn't the same. We hugged, but you were not my F anymore, you were really just someone that used to like me in the past, but you moved on, and I didn't, I stayed in the past. At least you did let me hold your arm throughout the whole movie, and even rested your head on mine while I was resting mine on your shoulder.

When it was time to go, I gave you a goodbye kiss, thanking you for the night we had, but praying deep down that we would see each other again even though I only had 2 days left in the city.

And we did! You went to my place the very next day, and we played on the switch the whole day with my cousins, and then we watched flooded away together. You had things to do at a certain time, but you still stayed with me for longer than you could, and when it was time for you to leave, I was trying my very best to not cry, hoping you wouldn't notice, but you did. Your uber came, I opened the door for you, and you, after 7 long years, leaned over to kiss me again. A goodbye kiss.

After that, I left my heart with you, in that city, and came back to where I now live. heartbroken but so grateful to have had the chance to see you again after so long, I was afraid it would be for the very last time. So, I was forced to make myself another heart, one that hadn't you all over it.

I cried for months after that though, I was grieving so much, grieving for a person who was still alive, and it was terrible. And I guess I am still somewhat grieving a bit, but now, everything is different.

We became friends again, close friends! We now send tiktoks to each other every single day, we usually go on calls on discord together with the group, you sometimes send me songs you like and playlists you make too, and you even wondered when I'll be going back to the city again, which makes me so happy, I'm so thankful you actually do think about me now throughout your day.

No, we never dated.

No, we will never date. And to be honest? I'm kinda happy we did not, because we wouldn't have lasted due to life circumstances, but we would have been a one heck of a couple if I hadnt moved again, and if you had actually TOLD ME you liked me and asked me to be your girlfriend. Maybe it was not entirely my fault afteral.

Yes, I love you, F, I'll forever love you.

And when I tell you that I love you, I now truly don't mean it romantically anymore.

I love you as a person, and I couldn't be more proud of who you became.

I love you for how much you changed my life, because if it wasn't because of you, I wouldn't be on the discord call with this specific group of people right as I write this.

I love you for the wonderful memories we made together, because you were the person that made me realize that the love I always dreamed of was not a fairytale thing, it could actually happen irl. And after 20 long years, it happened! Not with you, but with an adorable ""knight"" I have met that now is the one I see myself with in the future and couldn't be more excited to actually see how life will turn out with him.

I love you, F, I'm not yours, and I'll never be. But I hope you know that the 12 year old me was. She loved and will forever love you, I hope you won't forget about her. And I especially hope that the 14 year old you won't forget about her, because the 14 year old you is the boy she actually loves.

I love you, I'm sorry I was too dense.

I love you, I'm sorry I messed up in the past.

I love you, I'm sorry I won't ever have the courage to tell you all of this irl.

I love you, thank you for actually giving me another chance in our friendship and actually accepting me to a point we are close friends again.

He was really taken by how much the park had changed. And how he grew up here. He would stop every so often to share a few pecks. Lol. Then we kinda got lost. And got back on track. And talked about living Vancouver and Surrey. Our childhood kinda, about the states, reading, being dual citizenship.  Bro he doesn't drink coffee or tea. The on thing im happy about is that we didn't talk about our exes. We kinda joking with each other. He is the kind of person who need to complete something.  He suggested we finish going around the park. I could careless so I followed his lead. In the end im very proud of myself for showing up.  And expressing myself.  I didn't know what to expect today.

Each time, she‚Äôs seemed more relaxed and herself. I feel like we have a good vibe in person, but over text, it‚Äôs a different story‚Äîshe‚Äôs slower to reply, and the chemistry just isn‚Äôt as strong. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs just her texting style, or a sign she sees this more casually.

I invited her to a work party, and while her initial response felt a bit lukewarm, she did say she‚Äôd come if I waited until after her final. So she‚Äôs willing to go, which is great, but I keep second guessing whether she‚Äôs into me or just being polite.

For context‚Äîmy only real experience with dating was my high school girlfriend, and we even dated into part of college. So this is my first time navigating dating outside of that environment, and I‚Äôm still figuring out how to read things.

I‚Äôve been thinking about saying something like:

‚ÄúHey, I know we met through your sister‚Äôs dating profile, and I‚Äôve really liked spending time with you‚Äîjust wanted to ask if you‚Äôd want to go on an actual date sometime.‚Äù

I‚Äôm wondering:
	‚Ä¢	Is it too soon to bring that up?
	‚Ä¢	Should I wait until after the party to feel things out more?
	‚Ä¢	And is there anything I can do to build more chemistry over text without coming on too strong?

Any advice would help‚Äîthanks!


TL;DR:
Met a girl through her sister‚Äôs dating app profile, we‚Äôve hung out several times (coffee, baseball game, dinner, and she invited me to her apartment). She seems cool in person but dry/slow over text. I want to ask her out officially, but I‚Äôm not sure if she sees this as dating or just friendly. First time dating outside of high school‚Äîtrying not to come on too strong. Should I wait until after our next hangout to bring it up, or go for it?",0,1746334589.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

I finally pulled the trigger and got some more Wall Control shelves and new flat pannel Led drop ceiling lights. The LED lights will keep the box art from fading away, and I can properly store my consoles and perepherials. Though I still need to get display cabinets for the M2 Aracades (Battle Tryst, Total Vice, and Polystars). However, that will have to be next year. I will also be replacing the light switches with a digital wall control tablet to control the climate, fans, and lights. That will be next week.   
  
It feels good to finally get most of my collection out of storage boxes and put up on proper shelves. Although I still need to get a bit more shelving and some more pegboard to put the TV and consoles up on the wall as I plan to get rid of the TV stand to free up more space. This will allow me to put in a coffee table and a couch sometime next year. This has been quite a fun project so far, and may expand into PS2 collecting if you can spot my first additions in these pictures ;)

Some highligts of what's on the new shelves:

\- The consoles on display left to right:- NIB Testing Station (Extremely rare) - NIB US release FZ-1- NIB JP FZ-1 w/ 240p switch- CIB JP FZ-1

\- ""Most"" of the Perepherials are Sealed / NIB

\- All my play copies of games are on the top shelf.

\- The game wall are all sealed preservation copies until you get down to ""3DO Action Pak"". From there it is all CIB and some Korean titles.

1 - The endless Facebook updates(up to 5 a day), with every minute detail from what they have eaten, some hotel clerks that went above and beyond and then gloating how they didn‚Äôt bother to tip them, to the other random boomers they run into and flaunting how they are spending their kid‚Äôs inheritance. 

And then getting annoyed that I don‚Äôt like and reply to all their posts. They claim that I don‚Äôt care about them anymore and that they shouldn‚Äôt even post to keep us updated. I wish they wouldn‚Äôt. They can‚Äôt even understand some of the sarcasm from other family members who point out how frequently they are overseas and their lack of care factor when they miss important family events. Truth be known I‚Äôd like to put them on quiet mode so I don‚Äôt even see the posts. 

2 - Said Facebook updates feeling like all they are doing is putting some keywords into chatgtp , and posting what ever chatgtp spits out. I really wish my nephews had never shown my mum how it works, it‚Äôs like reading a  Nigerian scammer trying to sell you shares in a cruise company or buy coffee from some obscure place you‚Äôll never visit. I don‚Äôt think she is even bothering to grammar check the post before putting it up of FB. 

Seems like they get lots of likes from other Boomers who are jealous they are on holidays again, especially if it‚Äôs some random Bali local or booze hound they have met on a cruise. 

And don‚Äôt take this as me being jealous of said holidays, they worked hard and deserve to do what they want with their money. I just wish they were a little more humble and didn‚Äôt offend most of my cousins and other aunts and uncles who aren‚Äôt quite as fortunate.

SO reddit it is.

Hey, F, idk if you'll ever read this, and if you do, hopefully you won't know it's me, and if you actually do know, then I'm glad you are finally getting to know this, because I've been wanting to TELL you this for as long as I can remember but never actually had the courage to.

I met you when I was 12, back in 2017, I was obviously young and knew nothing about love other than Disney movies and daydreaming about one day getting married and getting to reach the point of the so called ""happily ever after"". You were 14 at the time we met, we went to the same english school together though we were in separate classes, I have absolutely no memories on how we actually became friends, but I know that right after that, you showed me the love I always dreamed of, and there are moments I genuinely will never ever forget about us that you probably has already forgotten since for you it probably didn't even matter.

It is stupid silly, but you were the very first boy to ever show me a romantic affection even though we never actually even dated. You were my very first long warm comforting romantic hug I felt, and I would give everything to feel the way I felt in your arms again, and I would never ever let it go this time, and oh I so much regret when you were going to hug me like that (not knowing it would be for the last time) and I somewhat refused because I was stuck in my own stupid world in my mind thinking you didnt like me when it was so obvious that you did like, and really, really liked me. I would give everything to go back to that moment and just jump into your arms.

I remember silly moments of us listening to music together, even though it was cringe 2017 anime and Rick and Morty songs. I also remember when I had terrible period cramps for the very first time in my life and I sat in a corner thinking you weren't going to see me or even care to look for me but you actually did care, and you paid very close attention to every small spot in the room even though it was full of people, and when you saw me you made a silly pose like you always did, resting your arms on your waist and slightly bending your knees while turning your head sideways with such a goofy smile. You came walking towards me and immediately gave me a hug and I knew what home felt like when it wasn't a house.

I remember when it was my 13th birthday, my mom took me to one of the best restaurants of the country, it was in our city and happened to be very close to the english course we used to go, and I couldn't stop thinking about how I was going to be late for """"""class"""""", all because I wanted to see you, my mom was so mad because I kept insisting I wanted to go to """"class"""" while she wanted me to just skip since my grades were good and enjoy my day with the family, but all I wanted to do was see you. And when I got to the school, we bumped into each other like a super cliche movie moment and I almost melted when I was speaking with my friend about it, especially because she saw it happening and she too adored it.

I remember when every single time, my friend would make sure to say out loud how cute we were together and how much she shipped us and adored us, and how you would smile and somewhat blush, and for whatever reason, I still thought you didnt like me.

I remember when you held my hand for the very first time in the car while my mom gave you a ride back to your place, it was warm, and soft, and I was so happy you did that. I kept insisting to give you more rides so we could do that more often, but you were always busy afterwards so it never happened. And once I finally managed to, you didn't hold my hand, and I felt my heart hurting a little bit and wondering what I had done wrong.

I remember when you kissed me for the very first time, we were texting about kissing each other for weeks and weeks but we never did it, I was too scared since it was my first kiss. When I had the chance to initiate it, I immediately gave up, but then you went ahead and leaned over to kiss me, it was quick, not even a second long, but it meant the whole world to me and I'm so happy you were my first kiss.

I remember when my cat died, and how all I could think about was how much I wanted to see you even though I did not go to the same english school as you anymore, but even so, I still went there, just so I could get some comfort from my favorite boy, and I was so right to go there, because you managed to make me smile when I was slowly diving into a bit of a depression in my life.

I remember, when you went to my place for the first time and how awkward it was because of how terrible my family is regarding boys, we had to stay downstairs in the living room where we had absolutely nothing to do, it was weird, but we still managed to just talk and use our phones to show each other memes and songs. You even showed me a love song actually- and yet, I still thought you didn't like me.

I even remember your ""love you too"" texts- yet, still the same thought, of course you didn't like me.

Then, not long later, 2018, I moved away.

We slowly stopped talking

You were never good at texting

And I thought you never cared.

We both lived our lives individually, but never actually stopped thinking about one another.

There are so many memories that I keep in my heart, and I still don't understand how I thought you never liked me. I only found out you did when YOU told me that you used to like me, on my 16th birthday, when you and I already had our own partners at the time, and I broke down crying because of how stupid and dense I was. How did I not realize that? HOW? I'm 20 now, and sometimes I still cry because of this thought. The thought of ""what we could have been"" haunts me.

Sigh.

So many things happened after that. I messed up And it would take me thousands and thousands of paragraphs to explain, so I won't do that.

But, there we were, 3 years later, I went back to the city, like I do every year, and I saw you again, we went to a cafe together to catch up on our lives. You looked different, and you sounded different, and yet you were somehow still the same, and gosh I was so happy to see you again after so long, all I wanted to do was jump into your arms, but I knew that if I did, you wouldn't have caught me. We were not close friends anymore, to be honest, not even truly friends, we were just two strangers who used to know one another, and yet you still gave me a chance to meet again for a sip of coffee (even though neither of us drink coffee but the phrase sounds nice)

We talked, and we laughed, and I listened to stuff about your career even though I still don't really get it, but gosh you looked absolutely beautiful talking about what you love and know. It was enchanting. You were enchanting.

After that day, I got desperate.

I kept thinking about you 24/7, I was not going to stay in the city forever, only 2 months, I was desperate to see you again.

I kept trying to talk to you and invite you to do things and to go to places so many times, but you would be either busy, or tired, or sometimes you just forgot, and gosh that hurt.

Then, I did it. We went to the movies together. I was so nervous. I wore the outfit I bought and I looked so cute for you, I did my nails even though one of them was hurting at the time. I also was trying my so very best not to actually throw up because of my anxiety, and I was just praying that I was going to be able to at least hug you again, to feel that warm comforting hug for maybe the very last time, and feel like home the way I kept in my heart and mind for years. Well... I... did hug you, but it wasn't the same. We hugged, but you were not my F anymore, you were really just someone that used to like me in the past, but you moved on, and I didn't, I stayed in the past. At least you did let me hold your arm throughout the whole movie, and even rested your head on mine while I was resting mine on your shoulder.

When it was time to go, I gave you a goodbye kiss, thanking you for the night we had, but praying deep down that we would see each other again even though I only had 2 days left in the city.

And we did! You went to my place the very next day, and we played on the switch the whole day with my cousins, and then we watched flooded away together. You had things to do at a certain time, but you still stayed with me for longer than you could, and when it was time for you to leave, I was trying my very best to not cry, hoping you wouldn't notice, but you did. Your uber came, I opened the door for you, and you, after 7 long years, leaned over to kiss me again. A goodbye kiss.

After that, I left my heart with you, in that city, and came back to where I now live. heartbroken but so grateful to have had the chance to see you again after so long, I was afraid it would be for the very last time. So, I was forced to make myself another heart, one that hadn't you all over it.

I cried for months after that though, I was grieving so much, grieving for a person who was still alive, and it was terrible. And I guess I am still somewhat grieving a bit, but now, everything is different.

We became friends again, close friends! We now send tiktoks to each other every single day, we usually go on calls on discord together with the group, you sometimes send me songs you like and playlists you make too, and you even wondered when I'll be going back to the city again, which makes me so happy, I'm so thankful you actually do think about me now throughout your day.

No, we never dated.

No, we will never date. And to be honest? I'm kinda happy we did not, because we wouldn't have lasted due to life circumstances, but we would have been a one heck of a couple if I hadnt moved again, and if you had actually TOLD ME you liked me and asked me to be your girlfriend. Maybe it was not entirely my fault afteral.

Yes, I love you, F, I'll forever love you.

And when I tell you that I love you, I now truly don't mean it romantically anymore.

I love you as a person, and I couldn't be more proud of who you became.

I love you for how much you changed my life, because if it wasn't because of you, I wouldn't be on the discord call with this specific group of people right as I write this.

I love you for the wonderful memories we made together, because you were the person that made me realize that the love I always dreamed of was not a fairytale thing, it could actually happen irl. And after 20 long years, it happened! Not with you, but with an adorable ""knight"" I have met that now is the one I see myself with in the future and couldn't be more excited to actually see how life will turn out with him.

I love you, F, I'm not yours, and I'll never be. But I hope you know that the 12 year old me was. She loved and will forever love you, I hope you won't forget about her. And I especially hope that the 14 year old you won't forget about her, because the 14 year old you is the boy she actually loves.

I love you, I'm sorry I was too dense.

I love you, I'm sorry I messed up in the past.

I love you, I'm sorry I won't ever have the courage to tell you all of this irl.

I love you, thank you for actually giving me another chance in our friendship and actually accepting me to a point we are close friends again.

I love you, Friend, and I hope that you also wonder what we could have been.",1,1746332700.0,Letters_Unsent,5,1.0,False

1kebei0,https://youtu.be/18yUmAvZ4nw,3 Very Scary TRUE Solo Camping Survival Horror Stories,"**‚ÄúThe Whistle Beyond the Firelight‚Äù:**

Work stress, a bad breakup‚Äîeverything was piling up. The city felt like it was closing in on me, every traffic jam, every meaningless meeting, every memory of what I‚Äôd lost grinding against my nerves like sandpaper. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I couldn‚Äôt focus. Even food tasted like cardboard. Something inside me was unraveling. So, I threw everything I thought I‚Äôd need into the back of my black Ford F-150‚Äîtent, camp stove, hatchet, fishing gear, a cooler full of beer and prepped meals‚Äîand just started driving north. Moose Creek, tucked deep into the wild north of Big Sky, Montana, had come up on a forum post months ago. Remote. Quiet. Unmarked trails. Exactly what I needed.

It was late October 2024. The air was crisp, the kind that bites just enough to remind you you're alive. The drive itself felt like a shedding of layers‚Äîthe further I got from the city, the lighter I felt. Asphalt gave way to gravel, and eventually to dirt. Pines thickened on either side of the road like ancient sentries, and soon cell service dropped off entirely. I welcomed the silence. When I finally rolled up to the trailhead, a two-track path barely wide enough for my truck, the sun was already low in the sky. I parked at a wide bend near the creek, where the trees opened just enough to reveal a perfect clearing blanketed with soft pine needles.

I stepped out and just stood there for a moment, listening. The only sounds were the distant gurgle of the brook and the wind sifting through the trees. No voices. No horns. Just the clean breath of the mountains. I unloaded my gear, stretching my arms after the long drive, and started setting up the old canvas wall tent I‚Äôd used on elk hunts years ago.

As dusk rolled in, I got a small fire going with deadfall and kindling. I leaned back against a log, the fire warming my legs, beer in hand, and just watched the sky go orange and violet and finally black, studded with stars. That first night felt like a kind of rebirth. I cooked a trout I caught in the brook, its skin crisping over the fire. When I crawled into my sleeping bag, the tent smelling faintly of pine and canvas, I slept like I hadn‚Äôt in months.

The next morning, frost had kissed the ground and my breath came out in clouds. I got the stove going and brewed coffee, the bitter steam mixing with the cold mountain air. I didn‚Äôt have a plan‚Äîjust wander, maybe fish again, maybe sit and do nothing. It was bliss. But the peace didn‚Äôt last.

I was packing a small day bag. A man appeared‚Äîtall, mid-forties maybe, with a thick beard and sun-weathered face. He wore a faded Carhartt jacket, the kind that looks like it‚Äôs been lived in for years, and a small backpack slung over one shoulder that didn‚Äôt seem to hold much. His boots were dusty, well-worn.

‚ÄúHey there,‚Äù he said, waving one hand casually. His voice was light, almost friendly.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I replied, trying to sound casual. ‚ÄúYou camping out here too?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, just passing through,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúName‚Äôs Steve. Mind if I sit for a bit?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt want company. But I didn‚Äôt want trouble either. So I forced a nod. ‚ÄúSure. I‚Äôm Tom. Grab a log.‚Äù

He lowered his pack and sat with too much familiarity, glancing over my setup like he was inventorying it. My cooler. My rod. My truck keys. Everything I had, his eyes grazed over like a scavenger‚Äôs.

‚ÄúNice spot,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúQuiet. You out here alone?‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúMy buddy‚Äôs meeting me tomorrow,‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúJust got here early.‚Äù

He nodded, smiling with his mouth. ‚ÄúSmart. Always good to have backup. No one around for miles. No one to hear you if something goes wrong.‚Äù

I chuckled weakly, though it felt like a gut punch. ‚ÄúYeah. Guess that‚Äôs the idea.‚Äù

He accepted a beer when I offered one. We talked for a bit‚Äîfishing, weather, gear. But it wasn‚Äôt normal small talk. He asked questions that dug too deep. ‚ÄúYou drive up here alone?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow long you staying?‚Äù ‚ÄúYour buddy know exactly where your camp is?‚Äù Casual tone, but each word felt like a probe, testing for weakness.

By noon, I was restless. He still hadn‚Äôt left. At one point, he wandered off behind my tent and stayed out of sight for several minutes. When he came back, he was quiet, and I noticed my axe had shifted position. It was lying on the woodpile, but the handle faced differently now. I didn‚Äôt say anything.

‚ÄúHey, man,‚Äù I said eventually, trying to sound light. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm gonna hike a bit before it gets dark.‚Äù

He stood up too quickly. ‚ÄúMind if I tag along?‚Äù

I forced a smile, shouldering my pack. ‚ÄúActually, I was planning to go solo today. Just clear my head, y‚Äôknow? Rain check.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt respond for a second, then nodded slowly. ‚ÄúSure, Tom. Catch you later.‚Äù

I left without looking back. I hiked hard and long, looping wide around ridge lines, pretending I had a destination. I didn‚Äôt. I just needed to burn time. When I finally returned near dusk, the clearing was empty. No sign of Steve. I let out a breath I didn‚Äôt realize I‚Äôd been holding.

That night, I barely ate. I kept the fire going longer than usual, ears straining at every sound. Just as I was about to retreat into the tent, I heard it‚Äîa low whistle. Slow. Purposeful. Like someone mimicking a bird, but not quite right. It came from just beyond the ring of firelight.

I stood still, blood turning cold. ‚ÄúSteve?‚Äù I called out, voice tight.

Silence. Then the whistle again, closer. I grabbed my flashlight and scanned the trees. Nothing. Just black shapes and moving shadows. Then a voice, low and amused: ‚ÄúJust messin‚Äô with ya, Tom.‚Äù

He stepped into the glow. His hands were at his sides, but then I saw it‚Äîmy axe, dangling from one of them, like it belonged to him now.

‚ÄúWhat the hell, man?‚Äù I said, stepping back. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt funny.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sure about that?‚Äù he replied, voice calm, almost gentle. ‚ÄúDangerous out here. Anything could happen.‚Äù

I held the flashlight up, not as a light, but as a weapon. My hands shook. ‚ÄúYou need to leave. Right now.‚Äù

But he didn‚Äôt move. Just stared at me, head tilted. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk inside,‚Äù he said, nodding toward my tent.

‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù I said, backing further. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call for help.‚Äù

His grin widened. ‚ÄúYou think anyone‚Äôs coming?‚Äù

I turned to run. That‚Äôs when I heard his boots thundering behind me. Then pain‚Äîwhite-hot and blooming across my shoulder like fire. I screamed, crashing into the ground, my body rolling against sharp rocks and sticks. I looked up, dazed, and saw him standing over me. He raised the axe again, eyes wide and wild. And I knew I had to fight, or I wouldn‚Äôt see another sunrise.

I kicked out blindly, my boot connecting with his shin. He grunted, staggered a step, and in that moment, I scrambled backward like an animal, blood warm down my arm from where the axe had grazed me. My flashlight was gone‚Äîsomewhere in the dirt‚Äîand I clawed for anything I could use. My hand closed around a thick branch, more club than stick, and I swung it up just as he lunged again.

The branch cracked against his ribs. He snarled and swung the axe down in a wild arc. It buried halfway into the ground beside me, sparks flying as it glanced off a rock. That gave me just enough time to get to my feet and run.

The forest was pitch black beyond the firelight, branches clawing at my face and arms as I barreled into the trees. My shoulder throbbed, every heartbeat a jolt of searing pain. Behind me, I could hear him crashing through the underbrush, cursing low and fast, not yelling‚Äîhe was hunting now.

I ran until my lungs were on fire. I knew these woods only in vague sketches from the day before, but I remembered a rock outcrop a half mile upstream from camp. If I could get there, I could climb it‚Äîget a vantage, maybe even a place to defend.

I slipped twice in the dark, slamming my knee into a root, my hand skimming across frozen moss. My breath came in ragged sobs.

The rock face loomed ahead, pale in the dark. I scrambled up, using roots and handholds slick with frost. I pulled myself into a shallow crevice halfway up and flattened against the stone, trying to quiet my breathing. Below, in the trees, I heard him.

His footsteps slowed. He was methodical now, stalking like a predator. I saw his silhouette moving along the trail, axe glinting faintly as he turned, scanning. He called out softly, sing-song: ‚ÄúTooom‚Ä¶ you out there, buddy?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt breathe.

He passed below me and disappeared into the trees.

I stayed there until dawn.

The cold was savage, but I didn‚Äôt dare climb down. My shoulder throbbed, likely dislocated, maybe worse. I pressed my jacket against the wound, teeth gritted. Hours passed. At one point, I saw movement again‚Äîfar off this time, across the brook. Him? Maybe. Maybe not.

When the sun finally bled into the sky, I crawled down and limped back to camp, every step torture. My tent had been slashed open. The cooler was gone. My rod broken. The axe still stuck in the dirt where it had landed, blood drying on the blade.

I didn‚Äôt stop. I went straight to my truck, keys still in my jacket pocket. Thank God. The tires were slashed‚Äîbut only two. I had a patch kit and a small air compressor. I worked fast, hands shaking the whole time, eyes scanning the treeline. Every sound felt like death approaching.

I don‚Äôt know how I did it. But by early afternoon, I had the tires patched and the truck rolling, slow but moving. I didn‚Äôt stop until I hit the first sign of pavement. I didn‚Äôt stop until my phone buzzed back to life with cell signal and I called 911.

The sheriff‚Äôs department sent a unit up that night, but they found nothing. No man. No signs, other than the damage to my camp. They said it was likely a transient. A recluse. ‚ÄúThat country draws all kinds,‚Äù one deputy told me, like it was supposed to be comforting.

But I know what I saw. I know he wasn‚Äôt just passing through. He‚Äôd been waiting. Watching.

I still think about it. Still hear that not-quite-right whistle in dreams. Still wake up some nights reaching for a branch that isn‚Äôt there.







**""The Night the Canyon Turned Cold"":**

It was a Friday in late September when I packed up my little hatchback with a borrowed tent, my sleeping bag, a small camp stove, a few cans of soup, some trail mix, and my sketchbook. The drive out was beautiful. The leaves were beginning to shift into their autumn colors‚Äîdeep reds, warm golds‚Äîand the road curved gently through dense pines and oaks. Willow Creek wasn‚Äôt too far from town, but it felt like a different world entirely. The moment I passed the weathered wooden sign at the park entrance, I felt a sense of peace settle over me, like the woods had opened up just to welcome me in.

At the ranger station, a small wooden building with a slanted roof and a screen door that creaked as I pushed it open, I met Ranger Tom. He had a gray beard, a baseball cap, and a relaxed, steady kind of friendliness that immediately made me feel a little less on edge.

‚ÄúWelcome to Willow Creek!‚Äù he said, flipping through a logbook. ‚ÄúFirst time camping solo?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I admitted, trying to sound like I did this sort of thing all the time. ‚ÄúJust need some time to unplug.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you picked a good spot for that,‚Äù he said with a smile, handing me a folded map. ‚ÄúStick to the marked trails, and if you need anything, there‚Äôs an emergency phone by the main lot. Cell signal‚Äôs garbage out here, so don‚Äôt count on that.‚Äù

I thanked him and left, driving the gravel road until I found campsite 23. It was a quiet spot, tucked just off the loop, with a clearing ringed by tall pines and thick underbrush. No other tents were visible, but I knew a few were nearby‚Äîclose enough for comfort, not close enough to intrude on my solitude. I parked, took a deep breath of the fresh, pine-scented air, and started unpacking.

Setting up the tent took longer than I expected. I struggled with the poles and fumbled with the stakes, my hands clumsy, but eventually, it stood tall and secure, a little crooked but solid. I laid out my sleeping bag and arranged my gear neatly inside. There was a satisfying quiet all around‚Äîjust the occasional rustle of branches in the wind and the distant call of birds. I sat on the small picnic bench beside the fire ring, sketchbook in my lap, and started doodling the trees, their tall trunks disappearing into the canopy overhead.

That evening, I hiked a short trail down to the lake. The water was still, glassy, reflecting the pastel colors of the sunset. I sat by the edge for a long time, just watching the sky change. When I got back to my site, I built a small fire, the crackle and pop of it somehow louder in the quiet. I roasted marshmallows‚Äîburned most of them‚Äîbut the sugary, sticky mess still tasted amazing. The stars slowly emerged as night deepened, and I lay back on the bench, staring up at them, feeling small in the best kind of way.

By ten o‚Äôclock, the fire had burned down to glowing embers, and the chill had crept in. I zipped myself into my sleeping bag, the nylon of the tent rustling softly as I shifted to get comfortable. Crickets chirped all around, and I felt calm, almost weightless, like I‚Äôd finally found the stillness I was craving.

I don‚Äôt know what woke me. Maybe it was a sound, maybe just that eerie instinct that something‚Äôs not right. One second I was asleep, the next I was wide awake, my heart already thudding in my chest. I stayed perfectly still, listening. At first, all I heard was the usual nighttime sounds‚Äîthe wind moving through the trees, a distant owl. But then I heard it. A footstep. Slow. Heavy. The crunch of dry leaves under boots, just outside the tent.

I froze, every muscle in my body locking up. My breath went shallow, my ears straining. Another step. Then another. Not rushed. Not panicked. Deliberate.

I turned my head slowly toward the side window of the tent. It was mesh, just a thin barrier between me and whatever was out there. At first, I couldn‚Äôt see anything. Then a shape moved‚Äîa tall, human silhouette against the dim outline of the trees. My mouth went dry. I reached for my flashlight with trembling fingers and flicked it on.

The beam cut through the dark and landed on a face. A man. Inches from the mesh. His skin looked pale, almost bluish in the light, and his eyes were wide, locked onto mine. He didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt blink. Just stared, his breath fogging the mesh slightly. He had stubble on his chin, a dark hoodie pulled tight over his head, and something about him made every instinct in my body scream that something was terribly wrong.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I asked, my voice hoarse and shaky. ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù

No response. His eyes didn‚Äôt move. His expression didn‚Äôt change. He just stood there, like he was waiting for something.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling the rangers!‚Äù I shouted. ‚ÄúYou need to leave right now!‚Äù

He took a single step closer. I heard a twig snap under his foot. That was enough. I yanked my backpack closer, grabbed my keys, and with one desperate motion, unzipped the tent door. The sound of the zipper was deafening in the silence. I bolted out into the night, barefoot, the cold dampness of the forest floor soaking into my skin instantly. Rocks and pine needles jabbed at my feet, but I didn‚Äôt stop.

Behind me, I heard movement‚Äîthose steady, deliberate footsteps. Not running. Just following.

My car came into view like a lifeline. I fumbled with the keys, dropped them, cursed under my breath. I snatched them off the ground, hands shaking uncontrollably, and finally got the door open. I dove inside, slammed it shut, locked the doors, and twisted the key in the ignition. The engine roared to life. I turned on the headlights.

Nothing. The woods were empty. But I wasn‚Äôt waiting for him to show again. I threw the car into gear and sped down the gravel road, dust rising behind me. When I reached the main lot, I screeched to a stop next to the emergency phone, jumped out, and called the ranger station.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a man at my campsite!‚Äù I said, the words tumbling out of me. ‚ÄúHe was watching me, right outside my tent!‚Äù

The voice on the other end was calm, professional. ‚ÄúOkay, take a deep breath. What‚Äôs your name and your campsite number?‚Äù

‚ÄúSarah. Number 23. Please, I‚Äôm alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got someone on the way right now. Stay in your car, doors locked.‚Äù

I sat in the car, staring into the woods, every shadow a possible threat. I could still see his face, burned into my memory. Those eyes. That blank stare. I gripped the steering wheel so tightly my hands went numb.

Fifteen minutes later, a ranger truck pulled into the lot. It was Tom. His demeanor was different now‚Äîmore serious, all business. I rolled down my window, barely able to speak.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù he asked, crouching slightly to see into the car.

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúHe was just‚Ä¶ staring. He didn‚Äôt say anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe found him,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúGuy from a group site not far from yours. Drunk out of his mind. Said he got turned around looking for the bathroom.‚Äù

‚ÄúDrunk?‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ he didn‚Äôt seem drunk.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre escorting him out and banning him from the park. You did the right thing. Want us to wait while you pack up?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt even hesitate. ‚ÄúYes. I want to leave now.‚Äù

Back at the site, with the ranger truck‚Äôs headlights casting long beams into the trees, I hurriedly grabbed my things. I didn‚Äôt even bother folding the tent, just ripped the stakes out and shoved everything into the trunk. The woods didn‚Äôt feel peaceful anymore. They felt close. Watching.

I drove home as the first light of dawn crept over the horizon. The sky was pale blue, birds just starting to chirp. But I felt none of the comfort I had the day before. My hands still trembled on the steering wheel.

When I finally stepped into my apartment, I locked the door behind me and sat down on the couch, my heart still pounding. I kept seeing his face. I kept wondering‚Äîwhat if I hadn‚Äôt woken up? What if I‚Äôd just lain there and let him unzip the tent? What if he hadn‚Äôt been drunk?

I haven‚Äôt gone camping since. I miss it‚Äîthe quiet, the stars, the sense of being far away from everything. But I can‚Äôt forget that night. I bought a satellite phone. Pepper spray. Read everything I could about solo camping safety. Maybe someday I‚Äôll go again. But not alone. Not without a way to call for help.









**""The Man Outside My Tent"":**

I needed a break, some quiet to clear my head. My days had started to blur together‚Äîtoo much noise, too many people, deadlines, the constant ping of notifications. I craved something different, something still. So, I decided to go solo camping at Willow Creek State Park, a place I‚Äôd heard was peaceful, with good trails and a wide, calm lake. I'd never camped alone before, but the idea of disconnecting from everything and just being surrounded by trees and silence sounded perfect. I was excited, maybe a little too confident, thinking a night or two alone would be just what I needed to reset.

It was a Friday in late September when I packed up my little hatchback with a borrowed tent, my sleeping bag, a small camp stove, a few cans of soup, some trail mix, and my sketchbook. The drive out was beautiful. The leaves were beginning to shift into their autumn colors‚Äîdeep reds, warm golds‚Äîand the road curved gently through dense pines and oaks.

Because the truth is, the woods can be beautiful, healing even‚Äîbut they‚Äôre also isolated, and isolation can be dangerous.
