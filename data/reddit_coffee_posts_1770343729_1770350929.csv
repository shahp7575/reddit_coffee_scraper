1qx7f2p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qx7f2p,Surprise Twin Peaks birthday evening from my wife,"I turned 39 today. All week my wife has been giddy with excitement over some hitherto unhinted at surprise. Cut to today and we have a lovely diner breakfast with our son, take a drive out to a snowy hilltop to take some pictures, come home and she disappears into the kitchen for like an hour. We head downstairs for dinner and she’s transformed the living room into a little Twin Peaks shrine and loaded up the current episode of season 2 we’re on. Dinner is a custom Twin Peaks menu, and dessert is cherry pie and black coffee.

Anyways, I’m insanely lucky and wanted to share the experience with you lovely people. We’re catching her up on season 2 as we have tickets to watch ep 1, 2 and 3 of season 3 at the Alamo later this month. I love it when this show shows back up in my life, lol.

Also: creamed corn. Much better than I remembered?",2,1770350739.0,twinpeaks,2,1.0,False

I’m a 26 year old guy living in DTLA. I work full-time and stay busy, but I’m intentionally making dating a priority because building a real connection matters to me. I’m not big on the party/nightlife scene. I’d rather spend time on things that actually add value to life.

I’m big into fitness and personal growth, and I’m currently studying to become a certified personal trainer, so health and nutrition are low-key nerdy hobbies of mine. I genuinely enjoy learning this stuff and applying it in real life. A lot of my free time goes toward training, being outdoors, and hanging with my dog.. he’s a big part of my life and definitely a bonus. He’s Goofy, loving and protective (just like his dad)

Personality-wise, I’m genuine, present, grounded, and very easy to talk to. I like good conversation, playful humor, and people who take care of themselves mentally and physically. I don’t really drink, but I’m fine having one once in a while in the right setting. I cook a lot , mostly healthy (and actually tasty) meals, smoothies, and once I’m comfortable with someone, I can make a solid margarita too.

I can be a total health nerd, but I also have a confident, masculine side and a pretty dark sense of humor once you get to know me.

I pray daily as a way to practice gratitude and stay humble. I’m open-minded about beliefs, but it does matter to me that someone I date believes in a higher power in some form: spiritual, Christian, Muslim, etc. Happy to talk about that naturally.

I’m down for coffee, walks, trying new food spots, cooking together, or doing something active around the city.

If you’re in LA, single, and think we might get along, send a DM. We can chat a bit and swap pics there.

Stay blessed and take care of yourself! :)",1,1770350655.0,LADating,0,1.0,False

Her vibe is
loud in a way that makes people turn their heads—
not because she tries,
but because survival taught her how to glow.
She keeps you guessing,
keeps you leaning in,
because chaos once lived in her house
and now she makes her own thrill.

Her vibe is
intuition sharpened by pain,
nurturing shaped by what she never got.
She gives without needing a spotlight,
holds things together with tired hands
and a heart that still shows up.
Not for credit.
Not for validation.
Just because love is the only language
she refused to unlearn.

Her vibe is
quiet when it matters,
watching everything,
ready for anything—
because fear already had its turn with her
and lost.

Her vibe is
a woman who still sees beauty
after being taught to flinch—
after voices broke her down,
after hands crossed lines,
after trust came with bruises.
She finds light in stupid small things:
coffee steam,
music in the car,
a stranger’s smile.
And somehow…
she is still kind.
Still gentle with people
who never had to be.

Her vibe is
boundaries carved from experience,
not attitude.
She wears her trauma out in the open
like a crown she forged herself
and slams doors without guilt
when peace is threatened.

Her vibe is not broken.
It is rebuilt with scars in the walls,
truth in the bones,
and a foundation so solid
it doesn’t shake when memories knock.

She didn’t come out soft.
She came out real
And that’s why she’s dangerous.

1qx7dbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1qx7dbo/quick_jump_in_tsh_iodine_overload_maybe/,Quick jump in TSH - iodine overload? Maybe?,"Just wondering if anyone has ever pinpointed a fast jump in TSH due to slight overdoing iodine. 

Dec 2025 my TSH was 2.8 very normal, then Mid Jan jumped to 19. My Dr retested after a fortnight and it was 23. (On that latest test my T4 was 8.9 and T3 was 3.1. Antibodies was 280). This was last week. 

I had started drinking large milk iced coffees around Dec and doubled a multivitamin that had iodine in, so am wondering if that was the trigger? If so I don’t want to medicate before seeing if it will settle once the iodine clears, but don’t want to wait if my body is struggling and it’s unrelated. 

History of mostly stable TSH, one postpartum spike to TSH 69 after my son was born 5 years ago, did not medicate but rechecked every 2 weeks and it returned to normal levels in about 4 months, with as best I could lifestyle diet and exercise improvements etc. Otherwise has always stayed within normal ranges despite the presence of hashimotos or antibodies.

Hello 👋🏼 

I’m looking for a partner, someone that’s my best friend and that I can connect with.

I like baking, reading, watching Netflix, painting, video podcasts and staying active. This year I’ve promised myself to get into more of a healthier lifestyle, meet more people and really pursue passions outside of work. 

Hot take for the evening - because nothing is better than a little controversy - winter should be a month max. We don’t need half the year in a frigid ice box. 

Looking for someone successful in their career (white collar professionals or entrepreneurs are what I gravitate towards) kind, respectful, funny, emotionally available and with good EQ. Also age-appropriate ( late thirties upwards) and EST would be great. 

Also if you’re from somewhere other than near Toronto, please be OK with the distance, like really OK :) I understand a LDR isn’t for everyone and hopefully you’re self-aware enough to know if you can handle one or not. 

If you feel we would gel, write back with a bit about yourself (I don’t respond to low-effort ‘hey’ messages) and the word ‘coffee’ so I know you have read this far :) 

Thanks 💕

1qx7b6t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qx7b6t,"You Would Not Know Me, and Nor Did I","*Burning Hills* by Michael Ondaatje. This was me. The poem, me. My voice. And he, the poet who spoke to me so intimately. 

I glanced at it just now and I can’t read it for how cold it is. Meticulous. Alien. It was me. My God. I’d quite forgotten his was my poet’s voice. I was stunned when I read it. I recall where I was in New York when I flopped the thick, well-worn anthology onto the narrow table in the pizza place across from the Arts and Science Building at NYU, a greasy slice dripping from its tip, with reticence, onto a cheap paper plate, which I had to request. Most simply stood and swallowed, nearly whole, the hot slice they’d just ordered, and waited in line again to order another. It was afternoon. The anthology, a badly used volume from the NYU bookstore, had been identified as a textbook for the creative writing class I’d signed up for surreptitiously. 

I don’t even know her now. The girl of 18 perhaps, maybe 19, who stood aside the narrow white table, which had the odd dirty paper plate or napkin left upon it. I looked out the tinted window to the street, deep in shadow since the sun had moved to the other side of the enormous university building, which took up an entire block. There was considerable foot traffic in its comings and goings from within and across the street, from the small eateries, a coffee-bagel-type shop and the pizza place on the corner, next to it. 

When I read this moments ago, I realized I’d completely forgotten who I used to be. I ***have*** completely forgotten. I suppose it’s easy enough to do. She’s been gone just six weeks more than 31 years. Perhaps I should be glad she perished on that dark highway, wet in the cold rain. 

For the first time in all these years since, I like who I am and even felt an internal squeeze like a hug, as if to say, *“Oh thank God you’re still here! I felt that old thing again!* ***And it frightened me!****”*

I believe this moment calls for some quotes. Ones that I’d put aside for the right moment. Now, is as good as any. I’ll also throw in some Robert Frost poems above. And the last thing I wrote concerning him in relation to my life, just below. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The man who wrote this masterpiece was Robert Frost. I’d perhaps be able to call him a contemporary, but I was a small child and had only just begun to write. His was the first real poem, other than my own, I’d been introduced to. Upon reading my first poem, my father was moved to read to me this one by Frost.

I found \[The Road Not Taken\] on a blog. The blogger explained, among other matters, how the poem was reflected in her own life. Then she asked for comments, an invitation to her readership to share their own stories. I didn’t quite share mine, but I’ll show you what I wrote. Should anyone run across this and wish to comment on their own experiences, please feel free to do so. Here it begins…

*I know this poem intimately, though perhaps, not as Frost intended. I see now, it has woven its fine and distinct threads into the varied tapestry that has been my life these 55 years. I am where I began some 50 years ago. How I came to be at the headwaters of my life once again, the capricious nature of time, my wanders, and the miraculous, which is everywhere and full of signs, is a tale much too long to share here. I have begun, and yet hope to put the full account to paper, and publish a book or three, though my life could fill volumes between the long nights where the light has withdrawn itself, so I must fumble my way forward, only to see who I am, vanish into the bend of the road ahead, and those moments where a clarity, better than any light at my feet, has shone in my mind so that I sight the road ahead, though not with my eyes. Indeed, my life has begun again, less bewildered even less bedeviled, though I am a bit weary of my long journey. The road I must take, is more clear than it ever has been.*

I don't want to just write him without understanding anything so I'm looking for some help. if any of you could help me understand the different languages in India (like how to determine which one I want to be his families native language). How Indian-American family dynamics are (i do want his family to be accepting in the sense of he is Bi and owns a coffee shop, but thats just an idea for now). Finally what religion do most Indian-Americans resonate with and practice. (I know that a lot of Indians practice Hinduism, I want to know if thats the same for those whose family been in America for a long time.

  Although the book is about finding love, I think that the way someone grew up plays a factor to who they envision themselves with and how they are in a relationship. I also might write more about his character in the future and want everything to be cohesive.

i read online previously you shouldn’t eat too many due to GI upset, but i didn’t realize it’s also not recommended for people who take diabetic medication, and now i’m a bit freaked out which probably explains the light pain in my chest (i tend to get anxiety pain like that and it does not feel as overt as the GI upset) and i have headache because im a little bit freaked out (i tend to get super worried about this kind of thing, nevermind the fact that i am emetophobic and at one point i did feel a bit nauseous)

It sits lower so that my 5 year old can go to town on it (pun intended). He loves trains. So this is most importantly a vessel for some train chugging. 

But it’s not easy expanding further in this space. Some ideas I had were to (1) get rid of the couch, (2) buy some corrugated black cardboard and expand the width by a baseplate, (3) add a second level and tunnel and to reclaim some lost space in the middle, (4) all of the above, ha ha .. 😆 or (5) leave it alone!

* **World class pour over, both in great beans offered for brew; and**
* **Excellent technique and brews, will brews dialed in for specific beans**.

In my experience, it's hard to find great pour over. And even when I do, at great places who really care, they often have a standard approach across beans. Often 1/15 ratio, medium course grind . . . something that will deliver solid cups for most beans, but not necessarily get the best out of them. 

**A few more deets:**

* **I'll be in Manhattan, so preferably there. Not sure I'll make it to Brooklyn.**
* **Have way too many beans as is so not looking to buy beans retail.**  
* **I will also happily take any amazing batch brew recommendations -** if/when I can't find elite pour over, that always seems like the better route than decent to solid pour over.
* **Happy to take general rec's beyond this of people's favorite places, but only if relatively new (past 5 years-ish). I used to live there -- pre- pour-over rabbit hole -- so am pretty familiar with the city otherwise.** 



**Kindly please don't reply directing me to other posts unless they address my specific q's above**. I've reviewed all posts I could find. The places that have gotten love on those posts generally are those below. But I couldn't find specific detail about their pour over, approach, etc (other than that Suited uses the Filter3).

Great products, bad customer service","I love Samsung products but their customer service has never been helpful. Idk why Samsung has regional warranty claims instead of global. I got a phone from the UK to Asia, it didn't have any issues but I asked Samsung customer service about one problem I was facing. They told me they can't look at products under warranty in a different region. They can charge me money to fix something but not under warranty. If I want to claim warranty I must take it to the same region I purchased it from. 

Never heard Apple say that. Don't like apple products but their customer service is exceptional. Been there a couple of times, they even offer spare phones that you can use while yours is being repaired and offer you coffee and water while you wait at their centre. 

I never had a Samsung phone break within warranty before, but it would be nice to know that if something did go wrong I'd be covered globally. 

Apple technicians make you feel cared for while Samsung makes you feel like you're the problem. Really wish that wasn't the case",2,1770349662.0,oneui,0,1.0,False

I’m not into the performative formal date vibe, the roster nonsense, or anything that feels like a game. I just want something slow, simple, and real.

I’m not really a big going-out person. I connect best with real conversation, consistent effort, and actually building something over time.

My ideal relationship is being each other’s person. Calling, texting, sharing every small detail we find interesting, sending random stuff throughout the day, and actually feeling close. Then spending time together watching movies and shows, playing video games, cooking something simple, coffee(I don’t even really like coffee lol) and walks, chill nights in, lowkey weekends. The simple stuff that makes feelings build naturally.

I’m drawn to the quieter homebody type: kind, loyal, low-drama, supportive, relationship-minded. If you want one person and you actually mean it, that’s exactly what I’m looking for too.

Some things about me:

I’m a pilot (private pilot, going for my instrument rating), future airline pilot

I absolutely love cars and I will go on for hours about random niche topics

FC Barcelona fan and yes I have opinions

Computer science at UMD

I’m really ambiverted quiet at first, then I’ll yap about literally anything

In a relationship I value honesty, commitment, and loyalty. If you’re looking for something real and you want to build, we’ll probably click.

Looking for 18-22 only, from the US, Canada or the UK.

1qx6x4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1qx6x4r/restaurant/,Restaurant,"Eliza is an assistant chef at a restaurant. She face-plants on her way in. Then, she greets everyone very loudly. Eliza almost forgets to wash her hands before starting. She stumbles over to a sink. She turned on the water, but someone just used the sink to wash dishes so the water was very hot. In fact, it was so hot that Eliza lifted the whole thing and threw it out the window. The pipe continued to spray water everywhere like a sprinkler. Eliza finds a banana peel and tries to shove it into the pipe to stop the water flow but the banana peel is shot out of the pipe and it flies across the room as the water keeps running. Eliza caught the flying banana peel and threw it out the window. Then, Eliza runs towards the head chef, slips and falls, gets back up, and keeps running. She shoved another random chef out of the way. She takes a turkey that the chef is marinating. The chef was not happy about this. He yarbled at Eliza. But Eliza dealt with him the same way she has dealt with everything else today. She picked up the chef and threw him out the window then closed the curtains because the glass was gone. The other chefs in the kitchen just stared at her. She squawked at them until they turned back to work. Eliza decides to go look at the menu to see what people have ordered. She sees that someone ordered dessert. Carrot cake (her favorite, except for the carrots). She looks around for a cake but doesn’t find one so she will check the fridge. She accidentally breaks the door but manages to fix it before she enters. She trashes the whole place and takes down all the shelves and stubs her toe in the process but she does not find a cake. She leaves the fridge but forgets to close the door. She goes to the storage room next. She knocks down everything in search of a cake then grabs a wheeled cart and rides it out, forgetting to close the door. The cart falls apart. Eliza looks in the freezer but accidentally locks herself in. She screamed so loud that the freezer’s walls fell apart. But then she proceeded to cook anyway. She goes back to the storage room and gets flour and sugar. Then she goes to the baking room and puts those two things along with some eggs from the fridge into a blender and mixes it all together until there is dough in the bowl. She drops one of the eggs on the floor and tells one of the chefs to clean it up for her or else she will throw him out the window. He tells Eliza that he will clean up the eggs in just a moment, but before he can, Eliza slips and falls on the eggs that SHOULD HAVE been cleaned up. So it's obviously the chef's fault. So, Eliza throws him out the window. Eliza is punished for committing this crime and has to do the dishes. She cannot stay on her feet. She keeps slipping and falling, and grabbing shelves to try to regain her balance. But she only ends up taking the shelves down with her. She cannot decide which of the plates go in what containers, so she just fills up a crate with spoons and blenders and turkey and shoves it into the dishwasher. Eliza doesn't realize just how terribly of a job she is doing: The dishwasher makes noises that it should not be making, the turkey comes out as nothing but bone, and, it is unknown whether Eliza MEANT to do the following, but, a dead chef came out of the dishwasher, , strapped down to the crate with seat belts and nails, their body burning hot, -and dead as well. Eliza put the corpse onto the cart and wheeled it out the window. The cart fell and fell, then finally splattered on top of the three corpses that were ALREADY piled in the street below, the one on the bottom had landed in the sink. The banana peel was lying on the ground a couple of feet away. Eliza shrugged her shoulders, and then farted, very loudly and greatly disturbed everyone in the room, including the people that were waiting for their food. But they didn't hear anything very clearly. They just heard a distant, loud rumble. Eliza returns to the dishwasher. She slips again. 20 minutes later, when she finally stood up without slipping, she took a step towards the dishwasher, fell down again, got back up an hour later, and then proceeded with the washing of the dishes. She forgets to put the stuff on the carts and put it back where it belongs so the stuff is overflowing on the counter and onto the floor getting dirty again. Eliza is missing the point of dishwashing. It appears she doesn’t fully understand that the dishwasher is cleaning the dishes. Why else would she be letting them get dirty on the floor? She finally realizes that there’s a pile of turkey, blenders and spoons, forks, ranch dressing, and cake, the corpses and cutting boards that go all the way to the ceiling. She puts all this stuff onto one little cart but the wheels give out and Eliza just drags a cart with people on it along with spoons and turkey and cake and french fries and popcorn and plates and a lot of other stuff. She stacks all 600 plates, but they all fall over and shatter on the ground. She tries to hold all the forks at once by putting some of them in her pockets, some of them in her shirt, some of them in her pants, some of them in her shoes, some of them in her hair, some of them in her bra, some of them in her sleeve and she looks like a stuffed animal stuffed with metal forks. She even has some in her mouth. Eliza burps and rattles the floor. One of the waiters comes in, just to see what the fuck is going on. Eliza demands the waiter doesn’t say anything or else she will throw the waiter out the window the waiter just trembles, their legs shaking. They whimper and then slip on a banana peel. Then, Eliza walks out back to the dishwasher. She puts a paper cup in one of the trays, and next to it, she places a single french fry. Next to the french fry, she placed a blade from the meat slicer that was attached to a straw and they were glued together with icing. Eliza needs to gain a better understanding of how to do the dishes, but she threw all of her teachers out the window. She yodeled for assistance, but none of the chefs dared to assist her. She blabbersquatted back into the kitchen. One of the chefs is doing very well making french fries. Eliza wishes to assist so she dunks her hand in the 3000° oil. There’s a loud hissing sound and then there is oil everywhere. The chef is burned to death. Eliza lifts her, places her on the cart, and then shoves her out the window. Eliza realizes that the trash can is overflowing with banana peels and coffee cups and pots and pans and carrots, so she takes the trash can, walks over to the window, and dumps it out the window. She realizes that there are still dishes to be done but she also has 600,000 forks on her. She wiggles until all the forks come out and then she goes back to the dishwasher. There’s a pile of forks that is filling an entire closet. At the dishwasher, Eliza is having some fun. The rest of the world is not. There are somehow 3 inches of water on the floor. There is smoke coming out of the dishwasher and it is shaking as if it could explode at any second. The dishwasher struggles to push out what appears to be an octopus on a plate. There’s a small bowl of ketchup next to it. Half the ketchup was water though because it was just in the dishwasher. The octopus is twitching and has burns all over it. It is dripping wet with steaming, hot water, and blood. There’s also steam coming from it. It makes a low grumble sound. Eliza picks up the octopus and throws it out the window. It lands on the pile of trash, consisting of pots and pans and meat slicers and french fries and shelves and spoons and cutting boards and knives and people and more people and more people and oil and water and juice boxes, and pieces of plates and banana peels and more people. Eliza checks on the dough in the fridge, but there is someone in the fridge already. She lifts them, then takes them over to the mixer. The giant mixer. Eliza places them in and activates the mixer on the highest setting until the chef is nothing but skin and bones. Then, Eliza takes the bowl of skin and bones and dumps it out the window, where it lands on the octopus and pots and pans and french fries and meat slicers. Eliza is going to try to make french fries again. She goes into the refrigerator and tries to get potatoes. She takes all 600 potatoes and fills her shirt up with them. On behalf of the tremendous amount of potatoes that Eliza is attempting to contain all at once for a single trip to the French frying machine, Eliza looks like she could potentially be the heaviest human to ever walk the Earth. She releases the potatoes onto the floor and picks up one to place it on the table. She then hovers over the cutting board, holding her Unbreaking III Netherite Chainsaw over her head. But after a moment, she realizes that she really doesn't need to wield a motor-powered tree-cutting gas-guzzling, disturbing the entire restaurant with noise and a minor earthquake just for this measly potato to be cut in two. despite her passion, it just wasn't environmentally friendly. She puts the chainsaw through the dishwasher and then throws it out the window. She’s about to need a new dishwasher. She looks around for something that isn’t a chainsaw and finds a knife. There you go buddy! Eliza charges back over to the potatoes, but slips on the potatoes on the floor and lands on all 600 potatoes all at once. They break her fall, but there are no more potatoes. There will be no french fries. Not many. There is simply what has to be at least 600 pounds of mashed potatoes on the floor. Eliza gets the janitor’s ride-on-the-floor scrubber and also a vacuum and also a broom and a windshield wiper and a toothbrush and an aroomba and a water vacuum and a pump and a spoon and a fork and a knife and an ice cream scoop and a magnet and a plow attached to a huge pickup truck attached to a dump truck with a trailer hooked in the middle. Surely one of these pieces of equipment will help clean up the 600 pounds of mashed potatoes on the floor. One of them better work because Eliza went through a lot of work to get a dump truck into a kitchen located on the 3rd floor of a building. She couldn’t get all the equipment through the elevator so she had to use a crane and break an entire wall to get a dump truck into the kitchen. She starts off using the ride-on floor scrubber, but it isn’t very effective at cleaning up mashed potatoes that are smeared all over the floor so she moves on to the next tool which is a vacuum. The vacuum simply makes noises like it never did before sounding like a dog with a very upset stomach but Eliza threw the vacuum out the window. Eliza tries to eat the mashed potatoes off the floor, but they are completely and utterly disgusting. She spits the mashed potatoes out the window where they land on the vacuum which is on top of a pile of skin and bones, which is by a chainsaw which is on top of an octopus. Eliza goes into the elevator and grabs the next one. The broom. The broom is not at all helpful in cleaning up mashed potatoes on the floor. Eliza snapped the broom half, put it through the dishwasher, put it through the meat slicer put it through the blender. Finally, she puts it in the oven, goes to the dishwasher, slips, gets up 10 minutes later, goes back over to the oven, takes out the broom, and then throws it out the window where it lands on- a pile of things. Eliza goes back to the elevator to find that the next tool is a windshield wiper attached to a car. Eliza flipped the windshield wipers out, flipped the car over by 270°, got in the car upside down, and then turned on the windshield wipers. The windshield wipers are not making contact with the floor, so they are not very helpful. Eliza gets out of the car (which is flipped over by 90 more degrees to get it to a full 360) eats half of it, puts the other half in the dishwasher, takes it out, puts it in the oven, goes back to the dishwasher, sleeps on the floor for a couple of hours, puts the car into the meat slicer, takes another bite of it, puts the rest of it in the pizza oven for an hour while she slides around the dishwashing station, and then finally throws the remains of the automobile out the window. She then regurgitates 3/4 of what she ate and projectiles it out the window as well. She goes back over the elevator to see what else might clean the mashed potatoes off the floor. She finds a toothbrush. But she accidentally flings it over to the sink. The sink is overflowing and Eliza now realizes that she has been in waist-deep water for the past eight days. Oops. The room with the mashed potatoes, however, does not have room for that much water, so the water just stays out of that room. The toothbrush didn’t work at all. Eliza put it in the dishwasher but it drops to the bottom and is shredded. She was glad to find a single piece of it. She puts it in the pizza oven for 10 days, takes it out, burps it up, eats it again, poops it out, and then throws it out the window. Eliza surfs over to the elevator. She notices that the next tool is a giant roomba. The roomba emits white smoke as soon as she places it down on top of the 3-inch deep, mashed potatoes at 6,000,000,000 pounds smeared across a 10-mile surface. Eliza puts the Roomba in the dishwasher. But the dishwasher refuses to work before the arumba is fully processed, and a moment later, it explodes. No one was harmed though. She puts the rumba into the meat slicer for many years and laughs, harder and harder as the electricity bill goes up and up, and she sits behind the computer reloading the page every five minutes. She does a slippery Dupee by the dishwasher, an old place, and then simply takes a pile of dust out of the meat slicer and puts it in the pizza oven and then throws it out the window after six months. Eliza gets the water, vacuum and pump and spoon and fork and knife and ice cream scoop out of the elevator while tying them to a random old lady's back and tying a rope around her neck and dragging her out of the elevator. She was quite slippery on the floor, so I made it as an easy transportation for Eliza. Eliza immediately throws the water vacuum and pump out the window. Then slides around by the old dishwasher for 16 years. Then, with the electricity bill higher than ever, and the water filling the entire room in some places, she does the worm over the mashed potatoes. She eats the spoon, the fork, and the knife. She didn’t poop some out put some in the oven for 80 centuries and then goes over to the mashed potatoes that have gathered a few maggots by now. Eliza has all the time in the world. She gets the ice cream scoop and starts flinging the mashed potatoes out the window. This works for a little while, but Eliza eventually gets bored of it. She then eats the mashed potato scooper, poops it out, eats it, burps it out, dances around by the dishwasher for 18 more Shift times that each lasted 106 billion decades, let out of fart that lasted a millennia and wiped out all of human civilization,  the remaining 8 chefs out the window, regurgitated the potato scooper 17 quadrillion more times (each time taking 2 hours) and finally threw it out the window. One of the chefs told her to hurry up so she got into the plow, plowed up all the mess of mashed potatoes out the window and got back to work after putting the plow through the broken dishwasher. She goes over to the ice container, scoops a cup of ice, and dumps it on the floor. She then farted so loud that all the ice cubes melted immediately. She then returned to the one potato, cut it up into the shape of french fries, but I accidentally dropped an icing to the 3000° oil so she decided to put her hand in the oil along with her whole body. She cannonballs into the giant bucket of 3,000,000° oil and then screams like never before she gets out with her french fries, places them in a bowl dumps 6000 tons of salt onto them, puts it on the giant plate, puts the plate on an even bigger cart, and wheels the cart, of her 300 quadrillion century old french fries, out the window, while sobbing. She grabbed a knife, some vegetables, a cutting board and goes over to the next part of the kitchen to cut up some vegetables. She drops off both of her hands and feet and legs and arms. She manages to put herself back together with icing and a lot of tape. and then some more tape and a lot of icing but she managed it. Somehow. But now, It’s time to make the soup! Alize gets a lot of water and puts it into a bowl. She then gets a lot of tomatoes and puts them into a bowl as well. She squeezes the juice out of the tomatoes and then puts the remains of tomatoes into the dishwasher for cleaning. When they come out, Eliza then eats them, regurgitates them and throws them out the window. She returns to her giant bowl of water-and-tomato-juice and puts it in the pizza oven for 80 years while she slips and slides around the dishwasher, goes swimming in the bakery, scuba diving in the food prep area and then goes belly flopping in the elevator. She hears the cable snap in the elevator go all the way down the shaft. There’s a very loud crash, Eliza has to go up the stairs. She does not appreciate this at all. It takes her 16 days to do this. 16 days to go up 2 flights of stairs to get from floor 1 to floor 3. When Eliza finally arrives in the kitchen, a random chef reminds her that time is ticking! Eliza hastily puts the soup in the pot, and then puts the pot on the cart, and then wheels the cart out to the eating people as fast as she can. She breaks through the door, and is not being mindful of her surroundings. She smashes into another chef who is snapped in half by the impact and the soup. The 3000 ton pot goes everywhere. There’s nothing in the kitchen of the heating people except for a 6,000,000,000 gallon fish tank of tomato soup. Elizer returns to the kitchen as fast as possible. It’s too bad that she broke the pump or else maybe she could’ve pumped out the billions of gallons of tomato soup from the building. Or she could’ve plowed out the remaining soup, but both of those items were not available anymore. Eliza gives herself a massage with a meat slicer then takes a nap in the pizza maker for 16 centuries. She wakes up, eats a couple cookies and then gets another reminder from ANOTHER chef that she is on a schedule. She eats the chef, regurgitates them and throws it out the window and then proceeds to serve the cake that that chef made. She prepares herself. She cleans the dried blood off of her outfit. Then, she runs as fast as she can towards the dining room. She sleeps on the way and breaks through the floor. She must climb up the stairs again, even though it’s halfway, it will take her 100 days this time. She finally arrives at the eating place and realizes that everyone there is dead. They expected their carrot cake trillions of trillions of years ago… The next day, Eliza is the waiter. She hands out menus to the first booth. It is a family of four. A wife, a husband, a son and a grandma. Eliza attempts to communicate like a human to ask if the family is ready to order drinks. The family looked at her as if she was wearing earrings that were bigger than her head. Eliza repeated herself. This time with an attempt for a better diction. Barry requested root beer. Patrick requested chocolate milk, Meredith requested wine and Ms. Joden requested chocolate milk. Eliza ran away so fast that she didn’t realize there was someone right next to her carrying a giant cake. She knocked them over and the cake landed on his head. More like her entire body. Patrick started laughing. Eliza got up but slipped on the cake as Patrick kept laughing. Eliza stood up and started charging towards Patrick with tight fists but slipped and fell down again. Patrick continued laughing wildly as Eliza tried to get up again, slipped again, got up again as Patrick kept dying, and finally got back to the table Patrick was at, panting. She picked up Patrick, threw him out a window and then proceeded to walk away. When she returned, she drank the chocolate milk as she was giving everyone else their things. Ms. Joden requests mac & cheese, but Liza farts so loud that she doesn’t hear missed you the first time Meredith requests, shrimp dairy requests nachos, and the infant gets baby food. Eliza runs into the kitchen and when she does, the only thing that Meredith and Barry and Ms. Joden hear is a very loud crash and they could only imagine what’s going on. Eliza will attempt to make mac & cheese. She asks the head chef where the pasta is but the head chef is busy making french fries. Eliza slowly walks over and brings attention to the chef by dunking her head in the 3000° oil trying to eat the french fries like a dog eating out of a food bowl, then she starts drinking the 3000° oil like a dog drinking out of his water bowl. The chef recommends that Eliza doesn’t do this again but now Eliza has the chef's attention. Eliza asks as loudly as possible. Where is the macaroni but the chef goes deaf and cannot hear Eliza. His next words he explains to Eliza that the macaroni is in the pantry. Then he walks away with his hands over his bleeding hairs. He falls down after a couple steps. Eliza laughs, kicks him, steps on his ass, and then lifts him up, bites his arm off, swallows his arm, and throws the remaining of him out the window, while farting excessively and laughing maniacally. She then grabs a horse and drops the horse on top of him. She trips over every single cart in the crowded walk-in pantry. She knocks over every shelf and breaks every box and every rack is pulled off the wall. There is so much noise. The chefs outside don’t enter to investigate because they’re completely and utterly petrified by the sound alone. The continuous sound was just so loud. Eliza exits the pantry, holding a couple boxes of macaroni above her head, waving them around while dancing and screaming, like she won the lottery. Her giant earrings bounced up and down on her shoulders. The chefs try to continue their work while they hope and pray that Eliza doesn’t request anything from them. They just hope that Eliza leaves them alone. Eliza must find the cheese. She goes up to one of the chefs and screams at them in the face, where the cheese is all farting and burping. The chef just shakes her head and falls to the floor. Eliza goes to the next chef who is an old man. She starts to scream at him, but he has a heart attack and dies. She goes to the next chef, which is a young lady and she screams and points at the cheese Before Eliza completes her process of finding the cheese. Eliza goes back into the pantry and starts moving shelves and racks and boxes and stuff out of the way. It’s almost as messy as her room at home. Eliza gets mad and starts thrashing around lifting every shelving box she can think of and throwing it out a wall. She pulls the remaining shelves off the wall and the remaining racks off the wall. She pulls the lights out of the ceiling as well she screams of anger and chucks things that other things. What was an organized pantry that looks like the cave of treasures from Aladdin. Eliza opens the door. A few boxes tumble out into the hallway. Eliza holds the boxes of cheese above her head, waiting them around, jumping up and down while dancing and screaming like she just won the lottery again! The cheese box opens, and the powder goes everywhere, including in all the other chefs' food that they were making. Some of it is sprinkled all over someone’s cucumbers that they were cutting And covers a bunch of peppers that were just sliced. At least 7 gallons landed in the oil fryer and there was more powder than oil. Eliza growls, but then looks in the kennel and sees that there’s still some left. She runs over to the baking room as fast as she possibly can, and then dump the remaining amount of cheese in the bowl, and then puts the spaghetti in as well. But then she thinks: now what?. She just had a bunch of cheese and dry macaroni in a bowl. She seems that this is done. She walks towards the exit of the kitchen to where the people are, but someone notices her plate of cheese and dry macaroni. Asks her if she is certain that her meal is complete. She replies that she is not sure. She did not follow a recipe. She did not put a certain amount of ingredients in. She did not even know what she was making. She was told at hot water so she does so. She goes to the dishwasher and turns it on by putting the bowl of macaroni and cheese through the dishwasher but she did not know that she turned the soap on as well so that person got a bowl of dry macaroni, powdered cheese, steaming, hot water, And dishwashing soap. Apparently it was the Elyza special this week. Jordan is so old that she didn’t know what it was. But Barry notices something is off and that there should be no blue substance in mac & cheese. He asks Eliza what she put in the mac & cheese, and Eliza says that it was a little extra something out of the goodness of her heart. She then proceeds to throw Barry out the window for arguing with her. Meredith is so scared but Eliza comforter by rubbing her back and then reassuring her that her food will be coming soon even though her son and husband were both just thrown out the window. Miss Jordan just sits there and eat her mac & cheese happily. Eliza rampages back into the kitchen like a rhino And runs over someone in the process. Eliza comes back five seconds later with a giant carrot cake. She places it on the table and Miss Jody doesn’t even notice. She then goes back into the kitchen to try to make sushi. She had never heard of sushi before, so she asked someone how to make sushi. But then she gets bored after a couple of seconds and gets a shark, chops it up, wraps it in pita bread, puts it in the microwave, puts it into the dishwasher, puts it on a plate, and then eats it. She then remembers that the sushi was not for her but for someone else. Eliza looks at some pictures of sushi to try and figure out what might be in it. She sees rice. She knows how to make that! She gets some rice and puts it in a bowl. Then she goes back to the picture to see what’s next. She sees that the rice is wrapped in what looks like avocado skin, so she grabs some avocados, bites them, swallows the pit hole, and then spits the skin back out and grabs some scissors to cut it into strips. She then puts the strips in the circles and includes them closed with icing. She puts the rings of avocado skin onto a plate and then fills them with some rice. She says that there’s something orange and green in the middle. like a pepper so she took a pepper, cut a piece of it, and shoved it in the middle of the rice. The green thing in the middle ALSO looks like an avocado. She goes back to the avocados, cuts a small piece of it, and puts it in the middle. She then picked up her plate of avocado skin, avocado, bone-dry/raw and uncooked rice, and red pepper and brought it into the restaurant. On the way, someone noticed that the rice was uncooked and told her that she needed to boil it in water first. So, she goes back, puts the rest of the dishwasher, and then returns to the restaurant. She gives Meredith the sushi. She then says that she will return with Barry’s nachos. His tummy grumbles. Eliza runs into the kitchen and asks where the chips are. A new member of the deaf community informs Eliza that there are chips in the pantry. I think it’s the chips from the pantry, but still on a plate, and she wonders if there’s anything else to add. She can’t think of anything off the top of her head so she starts to walk back into the restaurant but then before she does, she realizes that these chips were probably a bit dry and probably needed to be put in soaking hot water just like the macaroni and rice. so she lets the chips soak in boiling hot water for 10 minutes. Then, she takes them out, puts the pile of mush on a plate, and brings it out to bury. Barry is majorly dissatisfied with his meal and writes a Yelp review on how poor the restaurant is. He threatens to take a star away if the music is terrible next time. Eliza doesn’t apologize. She just farts loudly and burps louder while screaming even louder while dancing around and waving her arms, jumping up and down and screaming like she won the lottery with her giant earrings, larger than her head bouncing up and down upon her shoulders. Barry, grandma Joden, Meredith, and Patrick exit the restaurant. Meredith rolls her eyes as Jordan patches her tummy and says: delicious! It’s time for Eliza to order her own food. She enters the restaurant and insists on having a booth by the window. However, such doesn’t exist. Eliza is majorly dissatisfied, so she lifts up a booth and places it by the window. The waiter comes by and asks Eliza if she’s ready to order a drink. Eliza responds with a bunch of squeamish gibberish. Everyone looks up when they hear this. Eliza takes a deep breath, then calmly repeats herself with better diction, and explains that she would like to get Sprite with olives in it and in a bowl with a fork. The waiter is very concerned and very confused, but Eliza threatens to murder her if she does not obey Eliza‘s request so, she proceeds to get Eliza Sprite with olives in it in a bowl with a fork in it but she is embarrassed as she walks out of the kitchen as all the other chefs stare at her, but she continues anyway. Eliza claps happily and jumps up and down in the seat while making squeamish garbled nonsense noises. Then she faceplants her entire head into the bowl of olives and Sprite and then spits it out like a fountain. She then picks up the bowl, rests it on her head, and then bashes the window with it, shattering the window and cracking the bowl. Eliza then throws the bowl through the empty window frame and then squawks at the waiter to get her food. The waiter asks Eliza what type of food she would like. Eliza replies that she would like ALL of the food, meaning everything on the entire menu. She also threatened to murder the waitress if she didn’t allow Eliza to help make every single thing and if all of it was done in over an hour. The waiter proceeds to let Eliza in the kitchen, but also has another chef call the police. Eliza comes back to the restaurant the next day to continue cooking. She puts on her apron, washes her hands, and gets to work. This is the farthest she’s gotten without destroying anything! She’s going to make rice today so she gets a pot of proper size, puts it on the stove, and gets a measuring cup to put the proper amount of water into the pot. Then she turns on the stove to let the water start to boil. While the water is heating up, Eliza goes into the food storage to get the rice. The chef ran into the food storage compartment as fast as he possibly could when he heard Eliza go in but didn’t hear any crashing afterward. He thought Eliza had had a heart attack and got very scared. But then, when he saw that Eliza came out of the food storage without causing any damage, he was so shocked that he had a heart attack himself! Eliza nudges him out of the way and carefully brings the rice over to the pot as a couple of nurses go over to see if the head chef is ok. Eliza looks over the head chef as he sits up. A few nurses helped him to his feet.  Eliza knew he would be fine or else she would’ve helped him when he fell down. Anyway, the water starts to boil so Eliza turns down the flame on the stove and pours the rice into the pot of hot water. However, Eliza did not put the right amount of rice into the pot. The pot she had was approximately 10 cups filled with about 8 cups of boiling water. But the amount of rice that Eliza had was 80 cups. She poured all of it on top of the pot all at once. 10 cups did make it in, but 6 cups of water spilled onto the floor as did 70 cups of rice. Most of it went into the stove. The rice put the flames out. Eliza has a problem! There are 70 cups of rice on the floor. This is unacceptable and VERY unsanitary. Eliza starts eating the rice off the floor but then forgets that it’s not boiled yet, so she spits it back out. Some of that goes so far across the kitchen that it lands on top of someone’s nearly frosted cupcakes. They were about to put sprinkles on it, but they got rice on instead. They looked over their shoulder to see Eliza doing snow angels in 70 cups of rice on the floor at her– station. They sigh and then get back to work. But the other chefs ran over to try and clean it up. One with a broom, another with a mop, and they try to clean up the rice which is EVERYWHERE. But Eliza is in the way because she is still doing rice angels where they are trying to clean up! She laughs loudly while she flails her arms and legs. All the chefs quit their jobs that day, and the restaurant lost all its stars and its reputation and closed its business after a couple of days. Eliza walked away without a care in the world.",0,1770349286.0,FictionWriting,0,0.5,False

You’re not blocked and I’m still open to a conversation. I did show up at coffee to try to talk things out with you last time, however you did not.

Don’t act stupid, you know you did and it was pathetic and petty.

Every time I’ve been willing to chat, you either want me to come over which I’m not comfortable doing, or you want me to send you a massive text depicting my life and decisions. I do not trust you’d respect my confidentiality at this time and you’re around people who have been terrible to me but do not even know me, while simultaneously acting like subject matter experts on my life, career, and existence. I find that very upsetting. So no, we cannot text because I do not trust those would not be shared with people I cannot stand.

Eliza realizes that she is 2 hours late to an interview that she has now missed. At a rescheduled interview, the interviewer cannot believe the horrid behavior being displayed before her. Eliza is sitting improperly, her legs are shaking and she keeps intentionally kicking the interviewer’s feet under the table. Eliza keeps shaking the table and flailing her arms about. Eliza is very nervous, unable to keep her composure, and the interviewer has a number of other interpretations about Eliza that aren’t most favorable. She is deliberately slouching as if she has a deformed spine and is self assured that she doesn’t want this job. Why else would she keep screaming swear words at the poor interviewer or dress in nothing but a bra and underwear. Why else would she have shown up a half hour late to an interview that had to be rescheduled 16 times all on her behalf? Eliza returns for a 17th time and this time, she was wearing a red dress. However, she may or may not have remembered to put on underwear or leggings or anything beneath the dress. She definitely forgot her diaper because on her way in, she peed all over the floor and all over her legs. One woman escorted her to the bathroom. Eliza was in tears and collapsed to the floor in embarrassment. However, she was still peeing! The woman told Eliza that she would leave the bathroom and let Eiza do her thing. After a couple of minutes, water started trickling from beneath the door. The woman waiting outside the bathroom, noticed this she open the door to see if everything was OK, but the entire room was flooded all the way to the ceiling, and when she opens the door, water came pouring out, and the woman went on a little water ride through the halls, the woman has no idea how Eliza managed this an hour later, in another building, Eliza is told that it’s her turn. She gets her soaking wet purse and shredded briefcase and walks into the room. She pees herself again, but doesn’t do anything about it this time. She doesn’t react. Everyone else in the room does, but she does not. There was a trail of liquid everywhere she walked all the way from the door to her chair. The entire table is shaking because of Eliza. Her legs are shaking, and her legs are making contact with the table, legs, shaking the whole table. Eliza is vibrating like a car motor that is about to explode. It’s the one the next room over a field sleep vibration in the ground and she was low rumble. The interviewer in Eliza’s room remains calm. He asks Eliza what qualifications she has for the job. Eliza likes filing. He tells her that filing can be overwhelming sometimes. Eliza says that she is aware, and farts so hard that she launches herself 3 feet up in the air, and lands in her chair but all the chair legs break, and Eliza collapses to the floor sitting on a pile of wood scraps. The interviewer stands up quickly and walks over to Eliza. But Eliza insists that she stands up on her own. She grabs the table to pull herself up, but flips the whole table towards her, and all the paper and stuff slides in her direction and hits her in the head before knocking to the floor and the interviewer is standing nearby and tries to take control of the table before it slams on the ground but ends up with one of the table legs squashing his foot. Luckily, he was wearing work boots so he was fine and didn’t get hurt at all. He goes over to Eliza and asks her if she needs help. She says she’s OK. She stands up on her own without a table and then sits in a different chair. There’s wooden scraps and papers and pencils and binders and glass and water and pens and staples and bookmarks and erasers and pee and more pee and even more pee and just a bit more pee and more pee and oh so much more pure juicy pee everywhere. There’s even coffee on the walls and ceiling and coffee cups shreds everywhere on the floor. There’s a tea bag stuck to the wall because it was wet. Eliza’s dress is soaked and dripping wet. The interviewer asks if she is certain that she is good at sorting files. Eliza reconfirmed this. The interviewer tells Eliza that she has a job. Eliza does a dance. Her dress is bouncing up and down but since it’s wet, it sticks to itself so when Eliza jumped up really hard at the dress, flung up over her head and got stuck and completely exposed her lower half since she wasn’t wearing any underwear or anything. Eliza was completely exposed from the belly button below the interviewer relieves Eliza of any potential job. She then calls the police casually. And then runs away. Eliza walks into the next room and barged in on a meeting by breaking the door down, and throwing it across the room, where it landed in the middle of a table, bounced off the table, and then the corner was impaled into a TV screen on the far side of the room, and then pull the TV screen out of the ball sting, impaled into it, and fell to the floor. The people sitting at the table, all slowly turn their head towards Eliza Eliza shrugged, farted, and walked away, one of the people in the room, stood up and walked out into the hall. A couple people whispered for him not to get up, and one of them even tried to pull them back, but he refused. He had to figure out who this person was. She walks after her in the hall. Otherwise it looks back and see that he’s following her. She turns around and charges towards him. He runs back the other way and goes into a room and locks at Eliza immediately bursts the door down and towers over him. He starts shaking, sobbing, and hyperventilating, rolling on the floor. Eliza laughs and then locks him in the room. The rest of the people in that interviewing room were still in place. Eliza came in and sat down in the person's chair that ran away, and then asked them what they were doing. They had no idea what she said. She repeats herself, and one of the people tells her that they were going over The schedule for next week. They said it was a very complicated schedule. Eliza demands that they explain it to her. They start a few sentences otherwise it gets bored and crumbles with disappointment and boredom. The interviewers in that room told her to behave, and be quiet if they wanted them to read her the schedule. She refuses, and then bangs the table so hard that it flips over. She then walks out of the room and back kicks her chair into a wall. It shredded to pieces and fell to the floor into a pile of wood chips. Eliza slammed the door behind her so hard that it went through the hinges of the wall, and then flat like a pancake. The remaining survivors in the room could hear a distant fart, followed by a loud crash, following a loud scream.",0,1770349102.0,FictionWriting,0,0.25,False

Hi all it's my first time asking things like this online, so please let me know if there are better places to ask!

I have been in a long-term relationship (more than 10 years), but at this moment I am doing long distance with my partner. We have been long-distance for a long time so it's not a big deal between us, and our plan is to end the distance by the end of the year if things go smoothly.

Around last year when I moved to a new country, I met this guy as we're both from the same country (expats here) through mutual friends. At first, he's definitely not my type and I asked him out for dinner just as a friend, and we immediately hit off (as friends, of course). From the very beginning, I disclosed the fact that I have a partner, and my partner knows about his existence too.

My question is I sometimes wonder if he is interested in me, but I also wonder if I'm thinking too much, and this is making me a bit unsure of how to interact with him. A few examples: I am always the person who asks him if he wants to meet up (for some work stuff usually), he was never active (although he sometimes actively messages me). But he often shows some signs making me wondering stuffs, the most recent one was that we both attended a public event and when we gathered together (with other friends) afterwards he said sth like ""oh yeah I saw you rolling your eyes on that comment."" Or once he attended an event I said I'll go but it had nothing to do with his profession because he wants a book signed by someone in that event. I didn't think too much about this but a guy friend told me that it definitely means something? But also, I've asked him if he wants to go to an exhibition together and he said he'll find some other time to go himself, which definitely makes me wonder again if I am thinking too much. I'm so confused!

I don't deny that I enjoy being with this person and if I am single things might turn out differently, but at this point I do want to stay in my current relationship. I have many guy friends and there were never problems for me, like I can have dinner/go to coffee with them fine without feeling guilty. I guess I am just clueless whether I should maintain a distance with this guy or that based on what I described I am definitely overthinking?",1,1770348621.0,relationship_advice,12,1.0,False

1qx6izg,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1qx6izg/eliza_goes_to_the_airport/,Eliza goes to the Airport,"Eliza goes to the airport. The King Fahd International Airport, to be specific. The largest airport in the world. She’s ready to park her vehicle. There is just one enormous, 500-ton problem; Eliza’s vehicle is a war tank that takes up two lanes and can’t POSSIBLY fit in a standard parking garage. She decides to enter the airport's standard parking garage anyway, but it doesn’t work out. Eliza expected such a big airport to have slightly bigger garages. She causes MAJOR damage to the garage and tons and tons of people start screaming at her to stop. She was ANNIHILATING the poor ceiling. She looks like she’s trying to MOVE the building rather than enter it! She stops, backs out, and drives away to find a better spot to park her EXTREMELY UNAUTHORIZED vehicle. Eliza had hired a private company to build her tank and it had a fake license plate so no one could figure out who the owner was via technology or records or anything. Anyway, Eliza realized  she couldn’t just park in the middle of nowhere like she did at her grocery store back home. This was a new place. A new environment. A much more elaborate strict environment of order and sophistication. She couldn't just do whatever she wanted without consequence here. Eliza realizes they probably have specific places dedicated to parking. She just doesn’t know where. She sees some cars sitting in rows by a wall so she parks there. But then, some people behind her vehicle started honking. Eliza was blocking the way for cars to get through! She moves her vehicle and keeps driving. She comes across a sign that says long-term parking this way... short-term parking that way.... (both sounded like too much work). But then she saw a sign indicating the glorious existence of VALET parking services! Eliza liked the sound of that! She follows the signs to the valet parking services and finds someone to move her car. Then, she goes inside with all her luggage, including a caged lion right next to her. Eliza is ready to check in at the airport. There is a huge hallway with long rows of check-in desks. There are also rows of kiosks up against the walls. Eliza sees that the check-in counters have longer lines so she goes over to the kiosks and uses one of them. At first, things went surprisingly smoothly. It asked for what language. She chooses English. It asks if she is flying internationally. She confirms internationally. But then, it requires Eliza to identify herself. It gives her 2 choices. Eliza is prompted to either scan her passport or enter her passport information manually. And Eliza disapproves of BOTH of these choices! She looks for the “maybe later” or “skip this step” option but it is nowhere to be found. And the machine won’t let Eliza proceed until she verifies her identity and travel document details. So she takes a 3-foot sledgehammer out of her purse and smashes the kiosk to none more than bits and pieces while angrily screaming at the top of her lungs. But no one notices. She goes over to the check-in counters but will have to wait in line. Meanwhile, the valet is having some trouble moving Eliza’s vehicle. He can’t figure out how to start it because the interior of this vehicle is unlike anything he’s ever seen! He just cannot figure out how to use it. There isn’t even a steering wheel! The radio was blasting so unimaginably loud, sounding so strange, like complicated static combined with what sounded like every animal screaming all at once and communications from another planet just chanting gibbering, but rhythmically.

Back inside, Eliza positively gets into one of the check-in lines. After a moment, she frustratedly moves to a different line, feeling dreadfully chained down by the slow pacing of society that she was just certain would be the reason that the world would come to an end. Then she notices that the line she was previously in was shorter so she moves back over. Less than a minute later, she saw a different line that was even shorter so she went over to that one. After a minute, people join in her line, piling up behind her. Eliza keeps looking around for a shorter line and stands on her bags to get a better view to see the status of the other lines. But then a security guard kindly asked her to step off of her suitcase as it was clear that she had a DANGEROUS lack of balancing ability, an extremely ample girth, and there were people crowded nearby. But then, something catches the security guard's eye. A kiosk has been vandalized with a sledgehammer, smashed down to none but bits and pieces! The sledgehammer (which seemed to be about a meter long) was halfway through the machine like an arrow in a target. The security guard goes over to investigate, shocked that someone would do such a thing. Eliza is distracted by rebalancing herself and doesn’t realize that there is only one person left in front of her! Someone tells her to move forward and she does, surprised at how quickly the line moved. This check-in was going to be quick! She gets excited that it’s almost her turn and she starts to do the macarena, singing the song as loud as she can, not certain of the words so she is just shouting garbled nonsense, but she is confident of the rhythm! She is blabbersquatting gibberish, wobbling around, and having such fun! But after a while, she gets bored and the person is still not done, so Eliza moves to the line she was previously in. Then sees an old lady in the next line over who is about to have her turn but she drops her glasses. And when she bent over to pick them up, Eliza snuck ahead of her when she thought the old lady wasn’t looking. There was nothing in her way now! And if anything caused her to have to wait a second later, she would have a fit. Sure enough, the old lady tapped Eliza on the shoulder and cleared her throat gently. Eliza didn’t even turn around. Her face turned reddish-purple and green and black steam came out of her ears and elbows. The old lady said: “Never mind.” Eliza then proceeded with the already-traumatized woman at the check-in desk. It was Eliza’s turn! It was her moment to shine! For some reason, Eliza thought that just because she was talking with a human instead of a machine, she would be excused from having to present a relevant passport with valid information! The woman still asks for Eliza’s passport. Crazy. Eliza grumbles, but she says she will look for it now. The woman suggests an alternative but that would probably be too complicated (according to Eliza's intricate calculations), so Eliza completely blocks out the woman and starts going through her luggage. She takes out her first bag of clothes. She feels around to try to find it. But she doesn’t succeed so she sits down on the floor and takes her clothes out one by one and shakes them out, trying to find whatever it was she was looking for. She would remember once she found it, probably. Or she would just find it and put it aside and keep looking through her bags. Once her first bag was empty and her clothes were strewn all over the floor, she took her next bag and opened it, sitting on the floor, surrounded by clothes that were nearly stepped on by the people waiting in line, patiently. She takes out the items in the second bag. She takes out her toothbrush and throws it off into the distance. The woman behind the desk exclaims and tries to get Eliza’s attention but Eliza is having none of it and keeps going through her stuff. She takes her toothpaste and drops it next to her. She finds her backpack and starts emptying it, throwing water bottles, protein bars, socks, bras, hats, flashlights, first aid equipment, her glasses, her high heels, her bikini, and everything else that was in her backpack, all over the floor. After 3 hours of unpacking her stuff, and still more bags to go, Eliza began to think that it might be gone for good!  So she starts packing her stuff back up. She uses a ginormous vacuum that sucks it all up. 3 MORE hours later, her last bag was packed so she stood up to tell the woman that she didn’t have her identification. The woman said she could look up Eliza’s name on the computer as Eliza gently pulled her passport out of her pocket and placed it down on the table. She did it! Even though she had already missed her flight and her schedule was going to be a bit delayed now. But luckily, she hadn’t even bought tickets yet, which is what the woman asked next. Eliza says: What do I need to do? The employee tells Eliza that she has to check in for her flight, and then asks Eliza for her flight information. Eliza still doesn’t know what the employee is asking. The employee specifies and says that she needs Eliza’s destination, flight number, and departure date. Eliza already forgot the first one. “Whaaht??!” Eliza mumbled. The employee sighs and says “Where are you going?” Eliza replies “I’m going to the bathroom now.” The valet, still locked inside of the jungle-gym-of-a front seat, sits down in the bouncy colorful driver seat, water up to their knees, butterflies, loud noise, and they just don’t know what to do! They press a random button and the turbo engines roar to life with flames shooting out from behind and 12 monster tires come out of the sides of the vehicle and plant themselves down on the pavement, propping the entire vehicle up off its tank tracks and suspending it in the air. They press another random button with random symbols on it. After this, the hood turns into a red screen with a red exclamation mark in the center of a red triangle, flashing. The walls start moving in and out, making waves in the water. Propellers like that of a dishwasher rise from beneath the water until they’re just below the surface. The propellers turn on and make the water from the ground spray everywhere, water was already spraying from pipes from the walls and ceiling too, and that started spraying stronger, the fog all turned red and shot crazily. All the lights turn red, lighting up the water as well. The reflections of red light on the water go crazy because of the walls pushing the water, turning the entire place into a whirlpool and a wave pool at the same time. The butterflies seem to become angered and start flapping their wings, furiously and swarming around the entire place. They start biting the poor valet and whacking him with their giant wings. The radio chaos seems to die down to only a single voice that seems to be chanting gibberish like it was before. But now, it’s shouting the foreign incomprehensible, hopeless incoherencies, much louder, more intensely, and more deliberately. It starts speaking faster and faster, and louder and louder until it doesn’t even sound like gibberish any more, but machines whirring and machinery clanking and cranking and crackling and klonking! The clouds start bursting and the air pressure becomes so unbearably high that the valet felt like his head and entire body would explode! There’s also extreme wind and red rain and red air! The intensity of everything just keeps rising until finally, at the pace of airbags, the top of the tank recklessly rips itself open on hinges and the valet is launched out through the top and shoots upwards with so much force that he flies through earth’s atmosphere and goes into orbit. Then, the tank closes its roof perfectly, unharmed, with no damage, and it looks like an ordinary war tank in an airport parking lot once again (from the outside). But on the inside, things also calmed down. The walls stopped moving, the pressure and air pressure decreased, the radio stopped screaming and went back to its static, cacophony of animal cries and elaborate static, the butterflies calmed down, the hood turned back to normal, banishing the red screen and exclaiming yellow triangle. Most of the red went away and the rainbow colors (of the tank's insane interior) quickly became orderly and balanced, once again. Meanwhile, inside, Eliza has been gone for quite some time now. So the employee says they can take whoever is next. They ask for their passport but Eliza (who is in the bathroom) farts so hard that the whole building shakes. The people in line decide to run away. But the employee stays. Eliza comes back from her bathroom excursion and asks the employee where they left off. The employee says that Eliza needs to tell her where she is flying to. Eliza says she is going to Seattle. “What’s your flight number?” the employee asked. “It’s 69!” Eliza said, laughing. The employee repeated herself and then Eliza said she hadn’t bought tickets yet. The employee gave a plane ticket and Eliza opened up a new credit card to do so. Eliza required that her seat be in 1st class. Then, after the longest session ever, the employee gave Eliza her boarding pass, sent her on her merry way, and then quit her job. Eliza goes to the baggage drop-off. But she just has SO. MUCH. BAGGAGE. She doesn’t even know which counter to go to. She looks at her boarding pass to see what airline she has and matches the airline with one of the counters and goes to the one that matches. She has to get in line again but there are even multiple lines for different flights and passenger categories such as economy class, business class and MORE stuff that Eliza was clueless about. She gets in a line that says ""1st class"". The line didn’t move for a couple of minutes and Eliza was about to sue the airline. On second thought, she was about to sue ALL the airlines. She tapped her foot impatiently, sweating from head to toe, exhausted from having to be still, quiet, and inactive. She felt like she would explode. She had to do something soon. Finally, after thirty minutes of the world not revolving around her, it was Eliza’s turn. She is required to present her boarding pass. Luckily she knows where it is this time. She presents her boarding pass. The lady reads it and then tells Eliza that she’s in the wrong line, and points her over to the right one. A more crowded one, with a line that was so long that the end was out of sight, where she’ll have to wait, again. Eliza sleeps on her wheeled bed and tells the person behind her to move her up with the line and be sure to wake her up when it's her turn. Eliza fell asleep, then woke up, and magically, it was her turn! She presented her boarding pass to the person. They approved it. Then they ask for Eliza’s identification documents along with her passport and license. Eliza takes quite some time to find them but she does and gives them to the person behind the counter. The person approves and now it's time for Eliza to weigh her baggage. She has over 50 bags, ranging from 1 gram to 1 ton. One of them was a cage for her dearly beloved pet lion, which was in a giant 15x15-foot cage. Most of the other 50 items were over 200 pounds and more than 3 feet wide. This is too much for what’s allowed but Eliza pays extra to have other people's luggage terminated so hers can fit. She also had to pay thousands of dollars because the total weight of all her luggage GREATLY exceeded the maximum capacity. And it took a while to put tags on all her bags but they did it! She informs the staff that she has fragile items and is certain to have them specially labeled. She then gets a receipt that lists all her baggage. It's a rather lengthy receipt. The outstanding tank in the parking lot caught the eye of an employee in the airport’s radio watchtower just before the valet shot out of it. They were uncertain if what they saw was real, they didn’t even know WHAT they just saw shoot out of the tank. They just hoped it wasn't a person or anything. One of the millions of things they were particularly confused about was the fact that: although they saw the thing (whatever it was) shoot straight up out of the tank, it never came back down! If it shot at an angle, then it could have landed somewhere out of sight but no. It shot straight up. So it should have come back down. This is how they realized it must’ve gone into orbit. They checked the parking lot’s security and paused it and were shocked to see the shape of a person flailing when they paused it at just the right moment. Eliza enters security. She presents her ID and boarding pass, again. She has dozens of purses for carry on and she uses so many bins that she has to borrow some from other queues! Every single one set off the alarm because she had so much jewelry, knives, guns (for a shooting range or course), and magnets. She also has so many meds (that are in unlabeled bags) that she looks like she’s smuggling enough drugs to supply a whole village! She has hundreds of drugs, vapes, cigarettes, cigars, syringes, medicine cups, and a disturbing amount of 1-gallon medicine bottles. All the drugs and weapons and illegal objects in her baggage would’ve added up to a jail time longer than that of Yoda’s life span. But she explains each thing and tells a portion of her life story and all the context, including years of chains of events and reasons and memories with dozens of characters and somehow gets away with every drug, every gun, every vape, every cigarette, every knife and every item that she puts back in her purses and goes on her merry way. When it was time for ELIZA to walk through the metal detector, at first, she couldn’t fit through the metal detectors because her earrings were twice the size of her head! She turns and sideways steps through. But then the metal detector goes off because her earrings are made of titanium. So she takes off her earrings and goes through again. It alerts again. It's her steel buttons for her blouse. The next time it was the iron frame in her hoop skirt and she was required to take it off. Then the v-neck she had underneath had steel buttons also, so she removed that too. Eliza’s boots were made of pure aluminum and her pants had steel wire to let them maintain their shape. She is just told to remove those too. She is now in only a bra and underwear. Eliza is already getting tired. But she’s required to go through secondary screening before continuing with the long process of going through security. Almost an hour of inspections, excuses and stories later, she is finally released to the departure lounge. She went over with her 50 purses and sat down. The valet services MANAGER doesn’t know why the mystery tank hasn’t been moved yet. Nor does he know where the valet is so he sends out another valet to move the tank. The second valet went out and was both surprised and excited to see that he was allowed to move a war tank! He goes inside and experiences the same craziness that the previous valet did. Except unlike the previous valet, this one wasn’t dyslexic, so he COULD read that one of the buttons said “ejector seats”. He looks around at the sight to behold and tries to figure out how to start up the vehicle to drive it away. He sees that one of the buttons says ON. It’s a giant green circular button that’s two feet in diameter! The valet tries to press it but it doesn’t budge. He tries again. He stands up and uses two hands, leaning into the button and applying full force with his entire body. He looks like he’s trying to move a sleeping elephant blocking the road. And, like an elephant would, the button doesn’t move. The valet feels the button. It has the texture of brass like metal, or like a pan or a cymbal or something. He looks around and then sees a huge gong hammer displayed on the side of the wall. It rested inside a glass case surrounded by exciting LED lights flashing and glimmering with a variety of unique colors. They open the case to take the mallet. He carries the mallet (which is the weight of a sledgehammer) over to the start button and bangs it. The button rattled loudly like a gong and shook the whole room, and the entire vehicle roared to life. The valet couldn’t believe his eyes or ears or anything! Amidst all the excitement, he also just beat the world record for the most unique and strangest way to start a vehicle! The valet grabs the control yoke and is ready to move the car with proper control. But they just forget about the “moving” part. They have no idea where the gas pedal is. They can’t see anything around that area because there is colorful water up to their knees. They use their feet to feel around and they feel a pedal. They gently press the pedal when suddenly, everything in the vehicle buckles down and tightens, he sees reinforced walls pop up around the anterior part of the tank and it blasts forwards, so fast that the valet is forced backward into the seat as its cushion swallows him whole. It takes him a second, but he regains consciousness and realizes that all he has to do is take his foot off the pedal. He does so and the whole vehicle comes to a complete stop in less than half a second! The tires shot out metal stakes that impaled themselves into the ground, completely tearing up the pavement, but successfully stopping the car promptly. Then, the stakes went back into the vehicle’s tires and disappeared. The valet had had enough. Which was a good thing because the entire tank was about to be run over by a Boeing 747. It was on the runway! The valet opened the door, leaped out and ran away as fast as possible. But just then, an ENORMOUS woman came out of the window of the plane, climbed into the tank and drove it off the runway, just before it was run over by the aircraft. Eliza screams with anger, realizing that after so much trouble and drama, she just missed her flight to Seattle, and all her luggage was on that flight as well. No. There was still hope. The plane approached at barbling speeds. Eliza stands on the side then just at the right time, runs towards it after it starts to lift off. She leaps up and grabs on to the front wheels of the plane. But you know what… This time… THE PLANE WAS HAVING NONE OF IT! OHHHHHH! OHHH!!! WOAAH!!! SHIITS CRAZY MAN!!!!! SHIT’S INSANE BRUHHH SUUUU SHIIIIIIII SHOTS FIRED! The plane leans forwards until the nose of the plane scrapes against the runway and the whole plane explodes from front to back, but no one was hurt. She storms around the building, barging through all the “employees only” signs and goes in through the main entrance, and starts everything over again. But at least she has more luggage to take on this flight. She barges through the front door and shoves everyone out of line for the check-in desks. She has had enough. Security then came and started to pull her back for her violent behavior, but Eliza was having none of it. She farted so hard that the whole building shook and the security guards both fainted. She decided to SKIP the kiosks this time and charged towards one of the desks that had no one actively standing in line, but the lady behind the desk ran away. This gets Eliza VERY annoyed and she goes over to the kiosks to get her ticket. But it doesn’t cooperate and starts asking for what language so she immediately smashes it with another 3-foot sledgehammer that she pulls out of her purse and gets it stuck in a new gaping hole in the next kiosk, right next to the previous one she used, which was taped off and had an “out of order” sign on it, even though it was clear the kiosk wasn’t functional, considering there was no screen left, it had scratches all over it, all the buttons are broken, there is a giant 3-inch crack splitting the whole thing in two, and above all this, the entire thing was completely black and was burned to a crisp. Eliza pulled the sledgehammer out of the first one, then the second one, holding one sledgehammer in each hand, and smashed the 3rd and 4th one with both sledgehammers at the same time and squeamishly grunted on impact, Then she moved over to kiosk 5 and 6 and grunts as she smashes them in one hit, with both sledgehammers, one in each hand, before moving along to the next two, then the two after that, like she was a factory machine component, processing products on a conveyor belt — only instead, she was an unstable woman having a psychotic break over a kiosk and vandalizing an airport! She got bored so she left the sledgehammers stuck in kiosks 67 and 68 and walked back to the check-in desks when suddenly, she spotted an old friend. The woman who helped her earlier that day! The one who was quitting her job- at the end of her shift. Eliza is still more outraged than ever and she charges towards the check-in desk that she was at that morning. Everyone in line moved out of the way because Eliza couldn’t stop herself in time. She smashed into the desk and completely demolished it, sending rubble and ruins flying backward through the building. Eliza says “Oops!” and then goes to the next one. And stomps so hard that the desk, even though it was attached to the ground, breaks apart from the ground and jumps a foot in the air, then landing again and breaking, crumbling into a pile of rubble. Eliza gets so mad that steam comes out of her ears, her head gets 3 times as large as it usually is, and she begins howling, running as fast as she can in different directions, breaking something if it’s in front of her, and stomping as hard as she can, but also slipping and stumbling and tripping and rolling and face planting and tumbling all at the same time. After she is all tired out, her head deflates to a normal size, and her temperature is back down to a (not appropriate, but) tolerable level, she goes to a desk at the far end of the room. The last desk, by the stairs to the balcony and 2nd floor. The lady was hiding behind the desk and Eliza could not see her. But then the woman popped up from behind the desk and as soon as she did, Eliza shrieked “AAAAH”, as she stumbled backwards and landed on an old lady behind her, turning her into a lifeless pancake. But then, the woman saw it. It was a spider. A huge tarantula, sitting on the desk. Eliza eats it. The woman asks for Eliza’s passport, Eliza still has it in her pocket so she takes it out and gives it to the woman. The woman whimpers, then tells Eliza that she has to check in for her flight again, and then asks Eliza for her flight information. “Remember?” she asked Eliza. Eliza looked at the woman blankly, then said “Remember what?” “Remember how you gave me information and flight document details?” Then Eliza asked “What’s a document?” “Never mind.” the employee said. “Just give me your destination, flight number, and departure date.” Eliza says she just needs a first-class ticket to Seattle. But then the employee tells Eliza that the next flight’s 1st class seats are all reserved. But Eliza is having none of it. She tells them to get rid of someone in first class. The employee says she’s not permitted to do that. But Eliza threatened to eat herself and said “JUST GET ME A SEAT!” The employee does so. Eliza pays in cash, pennies to be specific. She gives the employee a plastic bag of exactly 2,254,147 pennies, having proudly counted every one of them! The poor employee sends Eliza on her merry way, hoping and praying she will never have to see her again. Eliza goes to security. Again. She now has to retrieve the baggage she left behind and will bring that on this flight. She breaks into a closet nearby and magically, her stuff is all there! All the 57 remaining bags! She goes through the same process as last time (just with less patience) then she gets on her flight but falls off the gates. So then she climbs up the plane like a monkey and breaks through the roof of the gates, falls through the ceiling, and lands on an old lady. Eliza gets on the plane with her loads and loads of bags. She takes up all the overhead compartments and throws the rest of her stuff in all directions, some of it landing on people's laps. The pilot goes over the safety briefing. Eliza farts 26 times throughout, each one louder and longer than the last. And ALL of them were VERY loud. Even the deaf old lady in the back of the plane heard it loud and clear. They were SO loud in fact, that it felt like the plane was experiencing turbulence in the air (even though it had gone nowhere). The seat belt sign was on now. Eliza stood up, pulled her table tray down, turned around, and sat on it. But she weighs so much that it IMMEDIATELY breaks. So she turned back around and tried to put the table back up. Then she sat down. She turned on the screen but it only showed safety briefings. This was unacceptable. Eliza was in first class and she wanted her television NOW. She started screaming slurs until someone came to her seat. Then she explained to them that her television experience wasn't satisfactory. They tried explaining to her that she just had to wait 30 minutes until they were up in the air. But Eliza couldn’t wait that long. She smashed the screen. Not sure what this accomplished. The seat belt and no smoking signs came on. (Eliza has been vaping and snorting cocaine this entire time by the way. Every second since she got out of bed that morning. Well, now it was yesterday. She’d been at that airport for well over 24 hours now.) Anyway, she whips out a 72-inch Plasma Flat Screen TV from her purse and then glues it (Elmer’s) to the seat in front of her but it’s too close to her so she kicks the wall with both feet as hard as she can and moves herself farther away from the wall. She just stretched out the entire plane. She then duct tapes the TV to the wall (the Elmer’s glue didn’t do jack shit) and plugs it in. Then she set up surround-sound speakers all around herself and set their volumes so high that there was a bit of static. She reclines her seat all the way backwards and crushes the poor old lady in the seat behind her. Then she starts watching Breaking Bad, despite the 7 and 12-year-old kids behind her. She dances around, kicking her feet so aggressively that if there was someone in the seat in front of her, they’d have a permanently broken back. A flight attendant comes by and tells Eliza that her TV is not allowed on the plane. Eliza tells him to suck her cock, then throws him out the window, still vaping excessively and snorting cocaine. The plane started to take off. Eliza’s seatbelt was buckled but she needed to go to the bathroom. She tried to take her seat belt off but it was no use. But she was about to shit herself so she started pulling as hard as she could, trying to break the seat belt open by thrusting her pelvis violently, while smoking and snorting, and screaming like she was giving birth to 5 babies at the same time. Her magnitude struggle was making the entire plane do barrel rolls. She finally stood up and freed herself. Well, sort of. She was still buckled into her seat, but her seat was detached from the floor and was on her back like she was a ghostbuster. She waddled down the aisle, snorting cocaine through her mouth and screaming with a huge chair stuck to her butt, bouncing up and down. (The plane was still at a 45-degree angle by the way.) She gets to the back of the 3rd aisle and destroys the doorway as she did with the other 2. But now she must get into the bathroom and she ate so much pie yesterday that she’ll be lucky if her HEAD can even get through that damn dwarf door. Also, her hair was 500 miles long and it was hanging out of the plane door, and was still connected to the toilet back at home, where she accidentally flushed it down. She stepped out of the chair strap like she was unchanging from her pants (although she couldn’t be taking her pants off because she’s been in only a bra and underwear since the first round of security yesterday) and she tried to open the door to the bathroom. It won’t open though so she breaks it down and throws it out the window then plows her big ass through the tiny doors, turns around, and sits down. But then she stands back up and turns around, finally realizing that there was an old lady in here the entire time and that she just sat on her lap. (No wonder the door wouldn’t open.) She picked up the old lady with one hand -not one arm, one hand- and placed her in the aisle. Then Eliza finally used the bathroom even though there wasn’t even a door anymore and someone was right in front of her. She got up and flushed an entire roll of toilet paper down the toilet, breaking it. Then she returned to her seat. But her entire chair was missing so she just sat in the row behind since that woman was away in the bathroom. But the man next to the open seat gently said, “Excuse me ma’am but someone is already sitting here.” Eliza looked to see if she was sitting on top of anyone again but she wasn’t so she blasted her speakers, stopped vaping and snorting cocaine, and went to sleep, snoring like an XP26 High Quality Dr. Power Lawn Mower. She woke up when they came around for snacks and drinks. She started vaping and snorting cocaine again, and then leapt 3 rows back in a single bound, and taking the whole seat with her again, stuck to her butt and strapped around her waist and back because she didn’t unbuckle herself from the damn chair, and ran down the rest of the aisle, but this time the chair was connected to the chair that was next to it, so Eliza was running down the aisle with a chair, stuck to her butt, and the man in a chair next to that one wobbling down the aisle connected to the one that was still strapped onto Eliza as she galloped. The poor man felt like he was riding a bull on steroids and wasn’t going to last long. Eliza charges for the cart of snacks and drinks like a rhinoceros charging at full speed. The lady pushing it just ran away, leaving the cart to die and saving herself. Eliza picked up the whole cart and tipped it upside down, spilling everything onto the floor from simple sealed bags of lays chips that just gently landed on the floor, to coffee makers that shattered on the walls, creating sparks and fires and splatter effects that Eliza hadn’t seen ever since she played 3AM paintball in her late great Aunt JuJu’s and Paw-Paw-Mimi’s living room! Everyone was burned with scalding hot coffee and bombarded with shards of glass and paper cups and napkins and cookies. Eliza really knows how to share the wealth! She takes all the food on the floor and brings it back to her seat then turns around and sits down with the two chairs stuck to her butt, still. She presses the button repeatedly then bangs pots and pans together screaming like a 5-year-old while still snorting cocaine, burping and farting excessively, and screaming slurs until the flight attendants come to her beck and fart and call. Eliza asks how much longer she will be in this “testing chamber”. The flight attendant says they still have 15 hours to go. Eliza loses it. She stands her huge double-ass chair up with a corpse attached to it, and starts rampaging like a rabid gorilla. She ripped up all the chairs while snorting cocaine through her ears, then she farted so loud that all the windows broke. Decompressing the cabin very quickly and causing immediate fatal failure in the entire plane. Then she sits down and waits for the plane to “land”. She gets out, stuck to the two chairs, kicks the door open, and jumps down 50 feet. Then she squirms out of the chair and walks away, forgetting all her luggage, wearing nothing but a bra and underwear, and having arrived nowhere remotely close to Seattle, or any civilization for that matter. She was in the bum fuck middle of nowhere. That was OK though she didn’t care. She kept snorting cocaine as she walked for eight years until she saw a building in the distance. Eight years. Doodle Jump finally updated! Ooooo!!! As Eliza got closer to the building in the distance, she realized that it was a cactus and then she just crossed the border into the Sahara desert. She kept walking for years until another plane flew overhead at about 60,000 feet. Eliza screamed so loud that the pilots just straight-up heard her, and landed, letting her onboard (but just a bit confused as to why her hair was streaming off into the distance). The pilot returned to his cabin as Eliza went to a seat, still with a double chair stuck to her butt and a 78-foot Saguaro Cactus stuck to her endless hair. She sits in a pair of seats, completely crushing them, forcing them through the floor, and replacing them with her two chairs with a corpse. Grandma Babra, who was sitting nearby, was traumatized. Due to an insufficient lack of fuel, the plane would have to land in the middle of the ocean and the cell data wasn’t great there so they couldn’t call for help. The plane sank and all 122 people were stranded in the middle of the North Atlantic with nothing but floaties. But there was a serious problem. Eliza’s hair was stuck to the plane and had finally almost run out of slack. And it weaved through the plane which was sinking! Although she was just floating for now, she was running out of slack and Eliza was about to be pulled to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean! She tried to communicate this to other passengers floating nearby but they just thought she was flailing in the water for the same reason a cactus was stuck to her hair. She finally explained it after 5 minutes and barely had any time left, but other passengers tried to find something sharp for her to cut her hair with. Someone had a pocket knife and started to swim over but they were out of time. The tension started to catch up. The plane sank at an angle away from them and Eliza started getting pulled away from the group. They all tried to swim after her but she was flying across the surface of the water at at least 40 miles per hour. She was starting to go down too. The man threw the pocket knife but it was thrown too far and it sank way ahead of Eliza, but then she was suddenly yanked under by her hair. And away from the floaties. She could barely see anything but bubbles. She looked around and barely saw the pocket knife sinking, but she was zooming right for it. She managed to grab it and tried to open one of the settings, it was a bottle opener. She opened another and it was a saw. She tried to use that but it didn’t work. She was pretty good at holding her breath for long periods. She usually started to struggle around 2 minutes. But the water pressure was unlike anything she’d ever felt since she sunk to the bottom of the Indian Ocean on her Australian cruise. She finally managed to cut her hair off and she wasn’t being pulled anymore. But she was still in her double chair and it didn’t float very well. Her floatie did though. She cut the strap of the chair and floated to the surface as a submarine went by, confused out of their mind as to what was going on. A plane just went by pulling a woman in an airplane chair by the head who looked like she was having a muscle spasm while trying to decapitate herself with a pocket knife while also doing some kind of underwater skiing. Eliza swam to the surface and over to her floatie, which was with everyone else but had been 5 miles away. Everyone was shocked to see she was alive and relieved. But there was a problem. There were 122 people huddled in floaties in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, and no one knew where they were because there wasn’t any cellular data! No one, passengers or crew, had any idea what to do. They all gathered closely and connected their floaties so that no one would float away. Night fell. Eliza started singing out into the night. She sang the songs of her people. She is just making whale noises. She calls out to her family and they come and rescue them. All 155 passengers and crew ride a pod of whales towards land. It takes forever, but they slowly make their way towards North America, hugging the gulf stream traveling north until the US Coast Guard finds them. However, Eliza prefers the Canadian Coast Guard so they keep going north until they arrive in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where the Canadian Coast Guard finds them and rescues them on a few different boats, providing medical attention, before they could get to shore.

Within minutes, the phenomenon hit the news! And Eliza was IMMEDIATELY put in jail as investigations went about to confirm her awaited imprisonment.",1,1770348149.0,FictionWriting,0,0.99,False
1qx6iwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1qx6iwo/just_survived_my_first_solo_trip_to_a_major_city/,Just survived my first solo trip to a major city: (Learned to navigate rush hour public transport and found the best free walking tours) 🚶‍♀️,"My first solo trip to a major city? Let's just say my grand entrance felt more like a frantic game of ""Where's the Metro?"" during peak rush hour than a serene wanderlust moment. I'd pictured myself confidently gliding through the streets; the reality was more like a sweaty, slightly panicked shuffle between various confusing maps and a sea of fast-moving locals. It wasn't about finding myself, it was about finding the right train platform.

Honestly, navigating that sprawling public transport system was my biggest pre-trip anxiety. How do you even *begin* to figure out a network you've never seen, let alone during the morning commute? Here's how I eventually got the hang of it, and how I leveraged that newfound freedom to find some genuinely good experiences without breaking the bank.

### Conquering the Public Transport Maze

*   **Pre-Trip Recon:** Before I even left, I downloaded the city's official transport app and a third-party one like Citymapper. I spent a little time looking at the main lines and how they connected to my accommodation. It helped a little, but nothing beats real-world immersion.
*   **The First Day Dive:** My immediate priority after dropping my bag was buying a multi-day pass. I opted for a 3-day unlimited pass, which cost me roughly **$35 USD equivalent**. This meant less fussing with individual tickets, and the freedom to get on and off without worrying about the cost adding up.
*   **Rush Hour Reality:** Learned fast that 8 AM and 5 PM are not for the faint of heart. It's elbow-to-elbow, surprisingly quiet (everyone's in their own world), and incredibly efficient. My tactic: find an open space, cling to a pole, and try to look like I know what I'm doing (even when I definitely didn't). Eventually, I found a strange comfort in the rhythm of the city's pulse.
*   **Asking for Help:** Realized people are surprisingly helpful if you look genuinely lost and ask politely. A simple ""Excuse me, does this train go to X?"" with a hopeful expression usually got me a quick, clear answer. Don't be afraid to point at your map.

### Unearthing the Best ""Free"" Walking Tours

Once I felt somewhat confident on the trains, I pivoted to finding affordable ways to see the city. That's where the **free walking tours** came in.

*   **Discovery Method:** A quick Google search for ""[City Name] free walking tour"" and checking out reviews on Tripadvisor or GetYourGuide usually yields several options. Hostels often have their own recommended tours or flyers too. I signed up for two different ones through a company I found online.
*   **What to Expect (and the ""Free"" part):** These tours operate on a tip-based system. They're technically free to join, but the guides work hard, are often locals, and genuinely appreciate tips. I usually tipped **around $10-15 USD equivalent** for a good 2.5-3 hour tour. Factor that into your daily budget.
*   **The Vibe:** They're a fantastic way to get an overview of a specific neighborhood or historical period, hear some quirky local stories you won't find in guidebooks, and get recommendations for food, coffee, or other less touristy spots. It was also a low-pressure way to meet other travelers for a few hours.
*   **My Favorite Moment:** On one tour, our guide led us down a tiny, unassuming alleyway and pointed out a local artist's studio tucked away. He gave us a brief history of the area's creative community – a detail I never would have discovered on my own. It felt like uncovering a little secret.

### Real Talk: It Wasn't All Smooth Sailing

It wasn't all triumphs and hidden alleyways, though. There were definitely moments of ""what have I done?""

*   **The Overwhelm:** Sensory overload is real. The constant noise, the sheer number of people, the bright lights – it can be exhausting. I learned to schedule ""decompression time,"" whether it was an hour with a book in a quiet park or just chilling in my room for a bit.
*   **Eating Solo:** The first few meals alone felt... awkward. I kept feeling like everyone was looking at me. Then I realized no one actually cared. I brought a book, people-watched, or just enjoyed the quiet. It became a peaceful part of the day, actually.
*   **The Unexpected Detour:** Got delightfully lost wandering off a walking tour path and found a beautiful, quiet square with street musicians that I would have otherwise missed. Sometimes the unplanned detours are genuinely the best parts of the trip.

My big takeaway? Being solo doesn't mean being alone. It means you're open to experiencing things on your own terms, and often, that opens doors to connecting with strangers (or just enjoying your own company) in ways you wouldn't otherwise. Oh, and comfortable shoes are non-negotiable. Seriously.

1qx6g1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1qx6g1v/this_is_an_emergency_broadcast_this_is_an/,“This is an emergency broadcast! This is an emergency broadcast! The monster is moving towards the Ginza district! Evacuate the area immediately! Evacuate the area immediately!”,"Katsuki Bakugo was never a happy man.

When he had to deal with the extras at school, his helicopter hag and dad, the smooth brains that called themselves teachers, and a certain useless Deku every damned day of his life; you can bet that he was almost always angry.

However; ever since he had been able to enter UA, he wasn’t as angry anymore.

He was depressed.

He remembered the day he heard that Deku had gone missing, that his mother had checked every inch of their apartment and couldn’t find him. At first he was relieved, maybe the maggot had taken his advice to heart and did the world a favor. But then as the days went by; he found himself growing anxious, they still hadn’t found Izu- Deku yet, and people were wondering if foul play was involved. Sometimes the anxiety got so bad that Katsuki found himself unable to sleep! HIM! The future number one hero, was losing sleep over a useless pebble.

Then Katsuki started to think, why was he so anxious to see the Deku again? To know that he was alright? The answer evaded him for many months before the entrance exa until finally, one night, it hit him like a brick.

It was because Izuku was the only person who saw him as an actual friend instead of a God. When everyone else was talking about how powerful his quirk was, Izuku was asking if he had any time to visit him. When everyone was talking about how he’d get into UA without struggle, Izuku was thinking about how much he wanted to be a hero along side him.

Izuku wanted to be his friend, and he pushed him away in the worst way possible.

All because he couldn’t fathom the idea of being friends with a quirkless person.

His depression worsened to the point where even when he passed the exam, he couldn’t even save a dummy without thinking it was Izuku. And that greatly hampered his abilities in the field; to the point where when the HPSC president had to make a speech to the press about the rising crime rates, he was demoted to watch duty.

He grimaced as the downpour continued without end. It had been raining for well over a week now and it wasn’t letting up, which only worsened his already shitty day. He didn’t think it could get any worse even if God struck him down right here, right now!

But through the presidents speech, the flashing cameras, the aside conversations, and the constant sound of the falling precipitation. He heard a sound, like someone banging a drum through an air tunnel.

**THOOM! THOOM! THOOM!**

At first he thought it was some traditional Japanese marching band, they usually played around these parts at this time of day. But as the sound got closer and louder, he felt the ground vibrate beneath his feet. He saw small objects like coffee cups and discarded press cards vibrating with the noise. Soon the reporters and cops and pro hero’s began to feel it to; and suddenly, the whole street shook!

Cars were leaping at least a foot into the air, people lost their balance and grabbed onto one another, objects in store front windows crashed and clattered to the ground in a growing cacophony.

And then, another sound pierced through the air, shattering windows and blowing out street lamps.

**SKREEEEEEEEEEEEEONK!**

The world around him trembled and shook, and the skyscraper down the street came crashing to the ground, churning up smoke and debris as a huge dust cloud came roaring down the street. Katsuki barely had anytime to duck down behind a news van before the entire street was covered in dust.

He could still hear the thooming sound combined with panicked screams and the sound of cars being crushed or tossed about. Out of either curiosity or stupidity he peaked out from around his cover and peered up at the massive silhouette that loomed over the street. The figure reared up, took in a massive gulp of air, and let out another thunderous, eardrum blowing roar.

Thats when he got a good look at it.

It was well over 200ft tall, with a large lower body and a small upper body. It stood upright like a man, but resembled some unholy cross between a dinosaur and a dragon. It‘s hands were webbed and had four fingers on each one, all of them ending in massive black claws. Its legs were thick and muscular, ending in four clawed toes, which were also webbed. Its face looked like a combination of those outdated depictions of dinosaur faces and a dragons muzzle, with pointed ears and sharp teeth and fangs. It sported a long, whip like tail, and had 3 prominent rows of protruding dorsal spikes, each resembling a spikier version of stegosaurus plates.

But for Katsuki, the most unnerving aspect about the creature was its eyes. Two deep pools of jade and ember that bore deep into his soul. But there was something so familiar about its eyes, like he had seen them somewhere before. Then after a few seconds it hit him.

**Those were Izuku’s eyes.**

There was not a doubt in his mind, those eyes were the same ones that Izuku had all his life. Then he thought back to Izuku’s last known location, the docks near Tokyo Bay. Then Katsuki thought “Is that the nerd!?”.

He watched as the creature continued down the street, unimpeded by the structures and cars and people screaming in terror. And as Katsuki lay sitting in the dust and paper and debris, he could hear the radio beside him sounding off.

”This is an emergency broadcast! This is an emergency broadcast! The monster, which had appeared in Tokyo Bay at 2:30 pm, is making its way towards the Ginza district. Please evacuate the area immediately! Please evacuate the area immediately! This is an emergency…”

It is not so much that I entered the café as I was suddenly just there.  Had always been here and would always be here.  The space materialized around me like a memory trying to become real—walls shifting between crystalline mathematics and flowing probability streams, floors that were sometimes solid marble, sometimes rippling quantum foam, sometimes wood, sometimes nothing at all. It flickered between configurations like a deck of cards being shuffled too fast to see: intimate two-person arrangement, sprawling Parisian bistro, cramped coffee shop, vast concert hall. One moment it stood empty and silent, the next it teemed with phantom patrons whose conversations created a cacophony of overlapping voices in languages that had never been spoken, accompanied by music that shifted from jazz to classical to something that sounded like mathematics made audible.

 

Only one thing remained constant: a sign above the counter, solid and unchanging, reading ""Schrödinger's Café"" in elegant script that seemed to mock the chaos beneath it.

 

The counter itself refused permanence. It stretched and contracted, became polished mahogany then stainless steel then pure light then something that hurt to look at directly. Behind it, pastries existed in superposition—croissants that were simultaneously fresh and stale and nonexistent, éclairs that flickered between chocolate and vanilla and flavors that had no names, cookies that multiplied and vanished in the same heartbeat. Display cases appeared and disappeared, sometimes full of impossible confections, sometimes empty, sometimes the concept of emptiness itself made manifest.",4,1770347838.0,writers,2,1.0,False

We chatted for a bit and he asked me out on a coffee date. I agreed, and since he’s new to the city and doesn’t know many places, I suggested the café and we set a time in the afternoon.

When I arrived, he was already there and had ordered a coffee and a cake for himself. I commented, “Oh, you already got something,” and he explained that he does intermittent fasting and got hungry.

He then told me I could go to the counter and order whatever I wanted. He didn’t offer to order for me or to pay. I ordered my coffee myself and paid.

When my coffee was ready, my back was facing the counter so I didn’t notice. He pointed and said something like, “It’s ready, you can go get it,” but didn’t get up or offer to help. That moment really turned me off.

The coffee was around $8, and he’s a civil engineer with a stable job, so this wasn’t about affordability. It was more about the lack of gesture or effort, especially since he was the one who asked me out.

We talked normally for about 10 minutes about his job and travels, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it didn’t feel like a date - it felt more like two acquaintances meeting up.

I eventually told him that if he was looking for friends, that was fine, but this didn’t feel like a romantic date to me. I explained that when someone asks a woman out, offering to pay - or at least offering to get the drink - sets a certain tone, and because of that, I didn’t see him as a potential boyfriend.

He responded by saying that some women are okay with splitting and that this wasn’t his first date. I replied that many women might not say anything directly, but would likely lose interest or ghost afterward. I then took my drink and left.

Now I’m wondering if I was too harsh or if my expectations were unreasonable.

**AITA?**

  
Edit 1: We planned to meet at 12.30PM and I reached there at 12.28. So no, I was not late. Also, I would have turned him down if he wanted to pay, but the fact that he did not even offer was my problem.

**Title:** Anyone Else Trying to “Do the Brain Right”? A Weird Song Made Me Think Differently About Work.

So—this is going to sound strange—but I stumbled on this track called *“Do the Brain Right.”* I clicked out of curiosity and ended up replaying it a few times because it hit me harder than I expected. It’s not just another motivational tune; it’s more like a reminder that our *thinking patterns themselves* affect the way we hustle, focus, and even rest.  

Lately, I’ve noticed my head gets cluttered flipping between gig apps, freelance projects, and RSI‑inducing spreadsheets. That song was the first time in a while I paused and asked, “Am I feeding my brain the right input every day, or just running on autopilot for the next paycheck?”

What I like most is the message: *productivity starts in your head before it shows up in your wallet.* After listening, I actually took a weekend to clear my space, journal my goals, and even schedule tech‑free blocks—it set off a small ripple that shaped my side income in ways I didn’t expect.  

Not going to lie, I’m still figuring it all out, but if you’ve ever felt mentally overloaded by online work, you might appreciate it too.

And if you do, come back here and tell me if it sparked anything for you. I’m genuinely curious if this resonates with anyone else trying to balance realistic hustle and mental clarity.

1qx69yw,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1qx69yw/eliza_works_at_brooksby_village/,Eliza Works at Brooksby Village,"Eliza gets to work and walks into the breakroom. There was one guy smoking in the darkest corner of the room, loudly having a conversation. He sat next to a motorcycle helmet which matched the sketchiness of pants and sweatshirt. He had one headphone in but his call was on speaker phone.

Eliza goes over to the vending machine. She swipes her card and reads the screen. It says to enter the item to purchase. She tries to enter B8 for the big fat cookie in the upper left corner. The machine does nothing. She starts rapidly pressing the buttons so hard that her hand starts to cramp up. The cookie doesn’t move tho. She looks at the little calculator screen and sees that it says tap insert or swipe. She growls. But swipes her card again. Then it starts vending the vends from the machine. The big fat cookie drops to the ground with a thud. Eliza cheers!! Then she gets her arm stuck trying to pull out the cookie. The vending machine wobbles violently. Then tips over. The sound was so loud that even the guy on the phone looked up. The vending machine’s frame and glass was in shambles, as was the floor. Also an alarm was going off. It was time to clock in. She clicks the clock in button and swipes her card. Easy.

Although one could not see it from the comfort of a rocking chair by the fireplace, the sky up above, darkened in fear, and everyone could feel it. The air grew cold. Every fireplace in the entire facility grew dim for a moment as a supernatural draft of cold air went through every room. Eliza’s shift had started.

Just outside Harvest Dining was The Den. It was a warmly lit, big open space where the residents, people, could come and meet for a coffee. It was like a big open living room, and it had a grand piano. A couple months ago, the piano's legs broke and it crashed to the ground. A massive panic erupted and a lot of damage was filed to the facility. But it was repaired, things settled and life moved on.

Today (and every day) the Den was bustling with residents. Some old men were slumped over a table, conversing about how they survived the Spanish American War. After every other time one of them spoke, there was a prolonged pause. It was like the conversation was being run by a confused traffic light.

A group of sweet old ladies sat elegantly at a spacious table, composed like first class passengers on a luxury cruise ship in the early 1900s. A partially complete puzzle of Boston was in progress in the middle of the table. Around it, the table was decorated with teacups, saucers, napkins and a vase of flowers. Ester Jane seemed to be the leader of the group. “Getting older was never something that people treated very positively, and I went into places where facilities were in terrible shape. Where there was abuse, where the elders were terrified of living where they were. Some of the facilities on the verge of being closed down and-” her voice trailed off into a mumble towards the end of the sentence, her tone dying as silence fell in a moment of sadness. They were a group standing up for the oppression of elders. Esther's tea sat still on the table. Ester Jane continued. “The elderly are not these people that are just- put off somewhere. Another member of the group nodded in agreement. Sitting across the table from Ester Jane was Mildred. She sat relaxed in her chair, swaddled in a large knitted sweater. She smiled warmly and adjusted her thick glasses, shifting her white frizzy hair. A lighthearted sense of hope invited itself back into the conversation. Mildred tapped in. “There are some positive things that are to be had in aging, if you are aware of them.” The group looked back to Ester Jane as she said “I am a hundred and sixty five fucking years old and I play tennis each week, I'm on a council of aging, I have my family, my life, my memories, my grandchildren! I have 165 years of experience! Don’t you treat me like I was born yesterday. Y’all wanna know what I was doing when Hitler was invading Poland?!? I was signin’ the papers to move into my damn apartment, right down that hallway! And you wanna know what I was up to when Titanic was sinking?!? I WAS GOING THROUGH MENOPAUSE! After this, Gertrude jumped in. Her animated head shook as her hands gestured to her every word. “I would not have believed that at 77, I could feel this alive!” “Yeah!” Mildred encouraged her. Gertrude continued to preach her enthusiasm. She stood up and pumped her fist in the air, people at neighboring tables looked up as she raised her voice. “It’s not time to give up!” “No!” Ester Jane cried with hapiness, cheering on her lifelong friend. “There’s still so much here!” “Yes! My goodness” she laughed with joy. Then they applauded her. “Ladies, our reservations await us in about 15 minutes.”

Eliza wobbled out of the breakroom barely squeezing through the door, with her uniform stretched to its absolute limits. The facility was bustling with residents going about their day, and a line of them lined up at the host stand, waiting to be seated. Some were waiting patiently, others looked like they’d been waiting since The Great Depression. Eliza will be seating the residents. She had no idea what that meant. She was stationed at the host stand. The host, Gabby, was a short and stubby woman who seemed like she hadn’t felt a single emotion since she was born. She side eyed Eliza. Eliza gulped, then she looked at the list of reservations and thought nothing of it. “Ok!” she thought. Gabby called out a woman’s name. “Barbra?” no response. A couple came up to the host stand. Gabby greeted them. “Hello, is it just two today?” “Yes.” replied one of the ladies. Then Gabby sent them off with a server standing nearby as she said, “Okay honey, enjoy your evening.” Gabby called Barbra again, but at the exact same time, Eliza stepped forward, and then… “BAAAAABRAA!!” she bellowed in a heavy New York accent for no reason. That wasn’t even how she talked. Why did she do that? She didn’t know, but she did it again. Butchering and blaring this poor woman’s name. “BAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHBRAAAAAAAA!!” In the dead silence, a frail old woman in a lavender shawl winced and slowly raised her hand. “TABLE TWELVE, BAAABRAAAA!!” Eliza hollered. The old woman slowly stood up and waltzed up to the host stand with her walker. “Take her to table twelve. “Okay!” Eliza shrieked. Then she leapt in the air to try and skip across the floor. Suddenly, there was a huge thunderous crash that sounded like an explosion, just outside the dining room. Ester Jane screamed, “OH NO! THE GRAND PIANO! NOT AGAIN! But the piano was just fine. Meanwhile Eliza stood over a crack in the floor with a sprained ankle, having tried to skip across the dining room. She continued off, walking, to find table twelve. “Eliza!” Gabby called. Eliza stopped in her tracks and turned around. Gabby held out a menu in her hand. Eliza had forgotten the menu! Eureka! She takes it gently, but with a dangerously excited and crazed look in her eyes. “You got it?” Gabby offered doubtfully. “YEP TABLE TWELVE!” Eliza said. She farted loudly, then turned away to find table 37, and waltzed off towards the back half of the dining room. Table 12 was the first table to the right. Gabby sighed. Eliza eventually makes it back to the nearside of the dining room and for some reason, she confidently puts the menu down on table 21, pulls out a chair, and stands behind it, gently resting her hands on the corners as she smiles warmly, looking at Barbra, expecting her to come over. Barbra cowered in fear on the opposite side of the dining room. “That’s not table 12,” a waiter stated. “SIGMA SIGMA ON THE WALL…” Eliza sang, walking away, leaving Baabraa stranded in the aisle to figure out the restaurant's seating system on her own. Eliza got back to the host stand. Gabby was busy greeting another party. Eliza looked at the tablet and scanned the chart. For a long moment, she just squinted at it like it was written in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. “Hrmphmshmbvrnmm…” she mumbled to herself, then called out a name from the list. “HAWORLD!” Gabby looked up. “No Eliza!” she said. “Not yet! I’ll call the names.” But Eliza didn’t listen. She started calling out all the names she could read. “ESTHAH! MAHHDRID! BARTHAALAMEO! SUSAAN WALLAFLAWHAA!” “NO!!” Gabby rebelled. she took the tablet away. Now the den was in an uproaring clamor of confusion and alarm. Some elders were standing up. Others looked to their neighbors with questioned glances. A group of veterans stood up like they were ready to fight. Gabby had to abandon her post to go and calm them down, and she took the tablet with her. But Eliza didn’t stop, and now she was screaming random names, “Alegrah!! Sonia! Chamberlain II!!” Now she was trailing off. Gabby pleaded from across the room, while breaking up a fight of two old men who were fighting like sloths. Eliza looked over at her and what she saw shocked her. To Eliza’s surprise, Gabby’s monotone expression and unstoppable side eye were overcome by a look of pure terror and distress, Eliza just stared at the disheveled blubbering mess of a woman which stood before her. Eliza shrugged it off and inquired about what her next task would be. Gabby recollected herself and called out “Harold” then Eliza screamed right afterwards, shaking the chandelier. “BAAABRAHHH” she hollered. Gabby ignored the screaming this time and just said “His name is Harold.” “OOPS!” Eliza shrieked briefly. “HAWROOLDD!!” Eliza shrieked extensively. A shaky hand went up. Harold approached with his quiet walker. It had tennis balls on the bottom of its legs. “Right this way Haworld” Eliza blubbered. Harold complied and followed Eliza, who departed to another random table in an aggressive power walk, shaking any tables that she strutted past. Harold’s rickety walker rattled like a crappy shopping cart as he tried to keep up with Eliza, stumbling over his own feet like a clumsy comical cartoon character being dragged by a jetski. ""YOUNG LADY, SLOW DOWN!"" Harold gasped. But Eliza be zippin’ n’ zaggin’ through tables like it MATTERED. The tennis balls on Harold’s walker popped off from sheer velocity. Eliza put the menu down on an occupied table, dunking it in a woman’s mac and cheese. The woman clutched her pearls. Eliza galloped back to the host stand with the grace of a stampeding moose. ""NEXT!!"" she hollered. Gabby scanned the Den. The residents looked terrified. Gabby said to Eliza “Ok so you’re gonna valet for a while.” “Okay!” Eliza said. Gabby nodded and put some laminated cards into Eliza’s ginormous apron. They fell so far down into the pocket that Gabby feared they may never be seen again, but this was the least of her concerns. She just hoped this next task was more fit for the human bowling ball on steroids who tranced off into the wild of the dining room. Gabby gulped.

Eliza surveys the dining room, hands on her hips like she be OWNIN’ this kingdom! There was a countless variety of walkers, canes, and mobility scooters of all shapes and sizes, cluttering up the aisles and blocking the way! Eliza screamed at the top of her lungs. Then ran as fast as she could, reaching desperately for a walker that was resting nearby. She stands before it, lifts it over her head, and hurls it across the room. A gentleman with a sleek red TurboRider 3000 Deluxe Scooter (complete with rearview mirrors and a horn that played “La Cucaracha”) flagged her down, unaware that he was making an enormous mistake. ""Can you take this please, young lady?"" he asked. ""FUCK YEAH"". Eliza said as she jumped onto the scooter like a Harley. The engine roared. She didn’t know how to drive it. Before she could even blink, the scooter shot forward at full speed. ""WAAAAAAAHHHHHH! Eliza tore through the cluttered aisle, mowing down three walkers and sending a cane flying like a javelin into a hedge. “SHE’S OUT OF CONTROL!” a woman screamed. Eliza’s hand cramped up again and got stuck on the accelerator. She tried to adjust her balance but instead wobbled dangerously and frantically regripped the scooter, hitting the horn. So now, the entire ride was accompanied by ""LA CUCARACHA"" at full blast. She swerved left and right. Then crashed, and returned to the host stand like nothing happened. She does a dance and starts exercising in place. Gabby tells her to just fucking stand still at the post and wait until she is instructed on what to do. A party of 3 comes up to the host stand and Gabby hesitantly tells Eliza to take them to Table 21. Eliza says “Ok” then takes the menus and walks off. Look how good she’s doing! The old lady behind her screams “WAIT! I can’t go that fast.” so Eliza slowed down a bit. She slowed down a lot actually. She felt like she was walking down a wedding aisle. She walked down the aisle and went around the corner. Then walked some more. Then into the other half of the restaurant. Then she remembered the tables had numbers. She walked back around. By now, 10 minutes had gone by and it looked like Eliza was a tour guide for the restaurant. The old lady followed behind to the best of her ability. Eliza made it back around to the first corner and went around again, finally seeing the card for table 21. She sat them down. The old lady was sweating. Eliza turned to go back to the host stand but an old lady behind her said “excuse me, can you take my scooter?” Eliza gets on the scooter and grips its handles. She revved the engine (which did nothing, as it was electric) and goes full throttle but it goes so slow that she barely feels it moving. She cranks the speed setting knob (which is pointed at a turtle icon) all the way to the right and points it at a rabbit icon. Then she goes full throttle but goes backwards into a table. She switches gears and looks at the old lady with a crazed look in her eye, then finally peels out of the peeled out of the host area at a blistering 4 miles per hour. The old lady just watched in horror, clutching her pearls. Her prized TurboGlide 4000 was in the hands of a lunatic, just like our government. Eliza zoomed across the dining hall, racing stunts over and under obstacles on her batmobile – that’s what it felt like, but she was on a wide-ass scooter driving abominably slow, weaving between tables like a confused Roomba, then finally crashing into a collection of walkers and scooters up against a wall. “MY SCOOTER!” shrieked the old lady. Eliza clambered out of the wreckage, holding someone’s lost tennis-ball-covered walker leg like a trophy. “Uh… oops.” Alisha, one of the managers, ran over, horrified. “Eliza! You were supposed to PARK the scooters, not demolish them!” Eliza nodded. “Ok. No scooters. Got it. I’ll just do the walkers!” She picked up a walker and held it over her head like a dumbbell. “WHERE DO I PUT THIS?!” she hollered. “In the designated walker parking area!” the manager snapped. Eliza turned her head like a confused dog. “Where?” The manager pointed to a clearly labeled section ten feet away. “Oh.” Eliza hurled the walker across the room like a medieval catapult. It bounced once, then landed perfectly upright in the walker parking section. The room was silent. “Well,” Eliza huffed, hands on her hips. “That’s one way to do it.”

Eliza returns to the host stand. Gabby asks Eliza “can you make 81 a 7-top?” The words rattled around in her brain like a couple of loose marbles. She was still perched on a scooter like a Walmart cowboy, hearing Gabby’s request loud and clear. Eliza had no idea what the host meant. But she wasn’t about to admit it. “YUP!” she shouted confidently. She jumped up and spun around with absolute purpose, which was impressive considering she was big enough to influence the tides of the Atlantic Ocean. “Make 81 a 7-top.” She racked her brain and almost had a stroke. 81… 7-top… Was it a math problem? Oh no. No one told her there would be math or thinking in this job. 81. Table 81? Eliza searched for table 81. She had already forgotten how table numbers worked, so she just started shouting ""EIGHTY-ONE!"" at random diners. “81?!” “NO, THIS IS 46!” ""81!?"" ""THAT'S THE SALAD BAR!"" She finally spotted Table 81 in the corner. It was a circular table with numerous chairs all around. Her initial assumption was that “7-top” meant to stack 7 tables on top of each other. She took 6 tables from nearby and stacked them on top of a circular base table, creating a completely horrific and inappropriate tower with dangerous structural instability in the dining room. Perfect. Almost. Maybe not. Something wasn’t right. She took the tables down and put them randomly behind her. Trying to solve the math equation of a statement Gabby had recited. 81 minus 7… No, that didn’t make sense. 81 divided by 7? No, you couldn’t just split a table—unless you literally split it, but that seemed excessive. Maybe the host meant for her to put 81 chairs in stacks of 7… Eliza stomped into the dining area with terrifying confidence. She eyeballed every chair in the room like a hawk eyeing its prey.

She ran across the room, hauling the chairs like a caveman dragging a mammoth’s femur. She held them all in a bundle with one hand. Residents were horrified, gripping their chairs like hurricane victims clinging to debris. One woman fought back, clutching her seat while Eliza yanked it with all her might. The woman was lifted off the ground for a second before the chair was slammed back down to the ground. Eliza let go. “Fine, you can keep it.” She continued taking chairs from all around the dining room, one by one, until they were in a huge pile. Then she screamed in frustration. She only had 45 chairs. She had collected every chair in the dining room (except the one with that stinky old lady cemented to it) she had fought battles, defied laws, and pushed limits and bounds beyond belief. The dining room looked like a fucking landfill. A waitress stared at the chaos in shock. “WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” Eliza, panting, threw her arms up. “I’M MAKING 81 A 7-TOP!” The waitress blinked. “That means add a chair. A single chair” Eliza froze. “Oh.” A long silence. Gabby, who had been watching this all like a slow-motion car crash, sighed. “You need seven chairs, Eliza.” Eliza blinked. She looked at the table buried in a goliath haystack of 45 chairs towering over her. That’s TOO MUCH. ""CLOSE ENOUGH!"" she announced. ""NO, IT’S NOT."" Gabby snapped. Eliza groaned dramatically, and slumped over to the pile, climbing up it and then started chucking chairs across the dining room with one arm. The host screamed. NO! NO!! ELIZA! STOP!!! Eliza stopped. Then spent 20 minutes putting the chairs back where they belonged and Alisha, Rae and Dana had to evacuate the residents, but they were able to let them back in now, and things resumed as normally as they could. Every soul in the facility was petrified but whatever. Eliza stood with pride for a job well done. A tiny voice called out. ""Excuse me, dear… could you please park my walker?"" Eliza turned to see an elderly woman barely holding herself up with a floral-print walker. ""I GOT IT, SWEETIE!"" Eliza bellowed at the volume of an air-raid siren. This old lady had just arrived, and had no idea what she had comin’. Eliza yeeted the walker through the air like she was pitching for Babe Ruth. On another Scooter, Eliza plowed through the valet section at a blistering 8 MPH, scattering walkers and rolling over canes like speed bumps. A turn was coming. She did not succeed. She yanked the handlebars, sending the scooter drifting sideways like she was in the final lap of Mario Kart, until she came to a complete stop, tuning the speed dial down, thinking it was the break, recomposed herself, and then took off at Mach Negative One Speed, because she forgot she turned the turtle setting back on. The host, the old lady, and an entire table of retired teachers just watched in silence as Eliza slugged away. It was nearing the end of the night. Alisha told Eliza she could go even though the shift didn’t end for 30 minutes. So Eliza screamed “SEE YOU TOMORROW BAAABRAA” “Sweet Jesus” Alisha muttered.",1,1770347443.0,FictionWriting,1,0.66,False

**“Motion before thought leads to chaos and imbalance”**

Old Drexari idiom, Vol Clade.

 

The brief Chen gave her was fleeting and nondescript.

 

“Investigate a derelict relay platform. No engagement is required. Nothing’s alive. Just check and leave.”

“That’s it?” was all Feebee asked.

“Yes. If you come across any hazards, mark them so they are known. Also, confirm the structural integrity of the platform so it can direct the determination of next steps. I’ll give you two marines. Support.” 



Feebee sat in the rest room, at a table she'd specifically reserved. They were in the middle of a shift change, it was packed. She'd just come from an hour in the gym, had showered. Was wearing plain camo fatigues; they bore no rank, name or branch insignia. The table was away from the entrance, serving areas and toilets. No doors or windows were behind where she sat, and she could see all comings and goings. It felt safe at a primal level.

Two marines arrived and stopped just inside the restroom. They were the two Chen had assigned to her.

The shorter, Alpha-2 was lean and wiry. Built for endurance. He carried a smile that didn’t quite reach the blue steely eyes. His brown hair was thinning and kept regulation-short. Clean shaven. A note in his service record had stood out, “*Exceptional situational awareness. Technically adept. Mentally resilient*.”

The other, Alpha-3, was solid, compact, the shape that comes from work rather than the gym. She noticed that he walked on the balls of his feet. Well balanced for his size which was a good six to eight inches taller than her. Black hair, greying at the temples. Stubble, two or three days old. His file said he was “*Reliable under fire. Aggressive when required. Trustworthy.*”

Alpha-2 was positioned slightly ahead of Alpha-3 who scanned the room. Classic recon, shield and spotter. His eyes rested on her without recognition or interest. Then moved on. They both looked worn, not worn out. Just worn.

They crossed to the coffee machines and poured themselves a mug each. Alpha-2 sorted through the small packs of biscuits and picked out two which he kept. Alpha-3 grabbed a couple of apples and a banana. He skinned the banana then deftly chopped it up, along with a couple of apples into a bowl, added some granola and milk from the dispensers.

 

The two sat a couple of tables away from her and were talking in whispers. They weren't to know she could still hear all they said.

""Nineteen! How can a full Captain only be nineteen? Not possible.""

""Well, her file mentioned cry exposure. Maybe that's it.""

Feebee felt it was time for her to introduce herself. Anymore and they may dig themselves into a hole too deep for her to ignore.

But first, 'How did they access my file? You said it was locked down.'

The QI responded, carefully, 'That's true. But access is always possible.'

Feebee thought she heard the QI laugh, almost girlishly, 'Did you just giggle?'

'Oh. Did you hear that? Sorry.'

'So, they either hacked it or were shown it. Chen?'

'Yes. That'd be my guess.'

 

""Mind if I join you?"" She asked in her most neutral of tones.

""Not at all."" It was Alpha-3 that responded first, looking her up and down, undressing her.

*Really,* she thought.

Alpha-2 saw her reaction and asked Feebee a question as she took a seat. Distraction. *He's good,* she thought.

""What is it you do on The Measured Response?"" He asked.

""Not much. Only just got here. About to go on an op.""

Alpha-2 put it together first. ""You're Captain Jones."" It came out as a statement rather than a question.

""Correct. Captain Feebee Jones. Alpha Team.""

The two of them nearly knocked the table over as they leapt up and saluted her, ""Alpha-2 reporting Ma'am.""

""Alpha-3 reporting Ma'am.""

She showed them a smile and gave them a small laugh to make light of the situation, ""Stand easy. Sit if you wish."" She pointed to their seats.

Both sat down. Ramrod straight. Neither said a word. Years of institutional training kicked in.

 

""You've been briefed on our mission. Thoughts?"" The leap caught them off guard, they looked at each other, *how did she know?* Chen had briefed them ""in confidence"".

They reappraised her. Cryo exposure or something else? Stuff always seemed to get weird around Chen.

She asked again, ""Thoughts?""

Alpha-2 spoke up, ""How come you got this assignment Ma'am?""

*Fair question*. *A good question if you’re putting your life in someone else’s hands.*

""I have a lot of relevant experience.""

""With relay platforms?"" He was dubious.

""Similar. Derelict spacecraft."" She let her words hang and watched as they processed them. Their reaction told her that Chen hadn't disclosed much outside the mission parameters. Good.

Alpha-3 spoke for the first time, ""We should plan for this to be more than expected.""

""How more?""  Not her best use of English but they got the intent.

""More intricate, more...."" He paused, searching for a better word, ""Complicated.""

Feebee smiled, ""Complicated. Nice. So we're on the same page, I'll share my mission brief."" She continued, ""Investigate a derelict relay platform. No engagement is required. Nothing’s alive. Just check and leave.”  She quoted Chen's words verbatim. ""If we come across any hazards, we are to mark them so they are known and to confirm the structural integrity of the platform. You two are to provide support.""

""Matches what we were told."" But then Alpha-2 continued, he found himself liking her. Felt he could work with her. She wasn't like a lot of the others. ""We were also asked to report back.""

She nodded, ""Of course. I'd expect nothing less. It's the first time I've worked in this unit. Makes sense.""

The two marines exchanged a glance. ""And you're OK with that?""

Feebee shrugged, ""Orders are orders. Would it matter?""

They laughed. ""I guess not.""

 

Feebee was issued with a small, long range craft, more a shuttle than a ship but it would get them there and back quickly, easily. The QM had checked and double checked her Qualifications and their Currency. All was in order, but he wasn't convinced. Must be a mistake. He'd never seen a pilot so young with such a range of current quals.

But when she sat in the seat, her hands flew instinctively, without looking, across the controls as she ran through the pre-flights. The QM watched; impressed.  She certainly knew what she was doing and was doing it well. He'd seen many experienced pilots 'bump' the ship on the way out. He hated that, the paperwork was a bitch. Cryo exposure was the only explanation he was given. Everyone else seemed to accept that so he just went with it.

 

As she took them to the jump point, Alpha-2 asked when she'd learnt to fly.

""Before... A while ago."" She wasn't dismissive or flippant but somehow, the way she answered shutdown the subject to further questioning.

""Strap in. We jump in thirty. On my count.""

""Alpha-2 good.""

""Alpha-3 good.""

She hadn't expected their response. It carried a degree of respect. ""Oh. Ok. Good.""

1qx60fm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1qx60fm/bad_morning_took_over_my_entire_day_and_i_wish_it/,'Bad' morning took over my entire day and I wish it could stop," Things have been turning in a new direction, I (23 nb) finally got a job I've been applying and working towards for 3 years, and I really like it so far. 

This is my first 9-5 job so I feel like a fish out of water for everything, and my parents (who've sheltered me for years) were just so overbearing. One of them nearly ruined my first day of work by yelling a swear word at me because he personally didn't like the way I organized my work bag. And yet I still had to go home and talk to them like normal and tell them what my first day of work is like. 

**For what happened this morning:**

Today was just too much, one of my parents have become a little too comfortable with just. . saying anything out of their mouth and just straight up being an asshole. I would ask this parent to repeat a question they asked me, and they'd make fun of me for having ADHD. Ok. I wanted to make a sweet coffee drink this morning, and this parent is in my ear all ""This is too much, stop it"" because they can just turn away, but no, they just have to talk. 

 This parent also picks fights and comments constantly on other parent, and the other parent. . . is so spineless. They don't know how to defend themselves, it's like a poodle fighting a bear. 

The asshole parent called my other parent a 'blue collar worker' in a derogatory way (they're classist) and of course, the other parent being spineless, is just like ""Honey. . don't :(."" I wish I shut my mouth at the time, but this time I told them to shut up. Because this is probably the 100th time this parent used that tone unprovoked. But guess what, the OTHER PARENT is mad at me. 

They're all ""How dare I use that kind of language, I was doing fine defending myself, you're just like \*that parent\* and I don't like the language."" and this parent was nearly trying to will into existence that ""I WILL turn into that parent just because I told them to shut up after constantly disrespecting the other parent.""

It's funny because the other parent only ever lets their anger out on me instead of the person that actually disrespects them. I've seen and heard this parent use the most horrifying words and throw tantrums towards me if I dared make a small mistake, if I made a comment that wasn't even on the same level as the asshole parent's verbiage. So now, this other parent is using all sorts of wonderful words towards me, they nearly lunged at me, and while asshole parent goes quiet and 'stays out of it' because they got what they wanted. Spineless parent yelled at me to just get out and go to work, and I did, as I muttered how they were overreacting. And as I started my car to go to work, spineless parent had the audacity to wave bye at me, as if they didn't say I'm the same as my abuser.

I even had a good day at work, but I was dreading going home because of how much my parents disrespect me, and it seems like there's nothing I can do about it. There's so much they hold over me, and I just want to cry",2,1770346709.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

I’ve been living in Scottsdale for about 8 months now and realized I haven’t done a great job meeting people outside of work. I’m trying to change that and figured I’d put this out there.

I’m currently building my own startup/app and spending a lot of time learning about the tech and AI space, especially where it overlaps with health, nutrition, and wellness. I’m early in the process, but genuinely interested in learning, connecting, and hearing how others here are navigating the startup world.

Outside of work, I’m also training for an Ironman later this year, so I spend a lot of time around gyms, trails, and endurance training. I’d love to meet more people who are building things, thinking long-term, or just enjoy grinding toward something.

I’d especially love to connect with:

* People working in tech, AI, health, or wellness
* Founders or early startup employees
* Anyone who’s been in Scottsdale longer and knows how to actually take advantage of what the city offers
* Potential mentors or just people open to sharing advice and perspective

Not looking to pitch anything. Just conversations, coffee, workouts, or learning how others here are building and connecting.

If this resonates, feel free to comment or DM. Appreciate it.",0,1770346688.0,Scottsdale,5,0.36,False

I've been bullied my whole life, even since kindergarten. I was abused by my mom my whole life until I moved away from her. I was sexually assaulted once in 5th grade, and again in 7th grade. I also got sexually harassed by the same person almost every day in 7th grade until I moved out of that class.

I don't know what it is that makes people hate me so much. I feel like some sort of non-human creature. Every time I walk into a room, I feel everyone judging me. 

My friends used to say that not everybody hates me, because they liked me. But they don't get it. One time I was at school, texting my friend when these two guys who I've never met before came up to me and started making fun of me. I wasn't doing anything wrong. I just wanted to talk to my friend and drink my coffee.

I always feel either too old or too young for the people around me. I'm in 9th grade, and when I'm in classes of people my age, I feel a lot younger than them. Sometimes I forget I'm 14 and I hesitate when someone asks me my age. I feel like a kindergartener surrounded by highschoolers.

Social interaction is hard for me, which I think is one of the reasons why people are so repulsed by me. I can't go to the bathroom at school because I'm worried about the germs and the people. I used to get harassed in bathrooms a lot, so I don't go in there anymore. I'm the type of person to pass out when they see blood, and I also have a habit of biting and picking at my fingers, which causes me to bleed a lot. I'm too nervous to ask the teacher for a bandaid or to go to the restroom to clean it, so I just squeeze my finger until it stops bleeding.

I don't ever talk to anyone at school. I just want to learn and leave. I still get picked on by students and teachers. I'm never involved in drama or anything. I'm really awkward and usually just take it when someone makes fun of me. I'm not strong enough to say anything back. I deserve the rudeness anyway, I'm a parasite.

I've been begging my dad to let me do online school since October, but my school's online program isn't taking any more students. He's trying to convince them to let me go online. I skip over three days a month each month. Getting out of bed just to repeat the same thing over and over again is so tiring and draining. 

I can't see myself as an adult. I don't know how a person (if I can even call myself that) could function in society like this. I can barely talk to people, I can't do group work, I can't do simple math, and I can barely even get out of bed for school. How am I supposed to be an important member of society like this?

My dad and brother probably think I'm weak and pathetic. I don't blame them. I hate being called weak but I know thats what I am. I'm nothing like the other guys at my school. I don't belong anywhere. My presence is really a burden.

Out of the box the grinder seemed to be very high quality and is nice and heavy. I ran a bag of great value beans through it for seasoning, and used the last bit for some test shots. Out of the box this grinder could not grind fine enough to choke the machine. And as close to the zero point as possible without audible chirping it could only get fine enough for a 20 second very sour shot (1:2 with 20 grams in the basket). I took it apart and realized the top burr needed to be shimmed. I did this and got it close to perfectly aligned. Ran some more test shots and no problem choking the machine. I switched to some locally roasted beans and pulled this shot after 2 feeler shots, about 3 numbers away from the grinders zero point. Very delicious. Exited to do some fine tuning and try out some new coffee styles. This blows the neretva grinder I’ve been using out of the water. Cheers. ",9,1770346639.0,espresso,1,0.91,False

It may seem kind of selfish and/or wrong at first, it just shows that you care deeply for our hurting community and country. One small change a day can lead to you feeling even slightly better about everything going on.

With that being said, what's a normal thing you've done today? 

For me, I finally started up a new game of Skyrim. One of my all time favorite games. Skyrim has gotten me through so much in my life and starting a new game felt like coming home after a long trip away. 

I'm hoping that this question can inspire more people than just me. We have to remind ourselves that it's okay to do something for yourself. It's okay to go get a coffee like you used to, or take the long way home from work because you like the drive better. It's okay for you to engage in your habits and hobbies.

So I built something to get it removed, or get paid when they ignore the request","So a while back I went down a rabbit hole and started searching my name on data broker sites. Bad idea. Or maybe the best idea I’ve had.

My home address, phone number, email, estimated income, family members’ names, all just sitting there on sites I’ve never even heard of. Being sold to whoever wants it. Marketers, scammers, doesn’t matter. Anyone with a credit card.

The thing that really got me was learning I already have the legal right to make them stop. GDPR, CCPA these laws exist. You can demand companies delete your data, show you what they have, or stop selling it. But nobody actually does it because it’s a pain in the ass and most people don’t even know where their data is.

So I built ReclaimMe (reclaimme.dev). It basically does three things:

1. **Finds where you’re exposed**. You put in the names, emails, phone numbers you want to protect. I’m using Firecrawl under the hood to crawl thousands of data broker and people-search sites and find where your info shows up.
2. **Sends deletion requests for you**. One click and it generates legally-compliant GDPR/CCPA deletion requests. I’ve got Resend handling the email delivery so they actually land in the right inbox. You can also download a copy of your data before you delete anything — your data, your call.

Basically: either they delete your data, or they owe you money. Either way you win.

Where things are at:

∙	It’s live. 3 free scans a month, no credit card needed.

∙	Firecrawl doing the heavy lifting on scanning

∙	Resend powering the deletion emails

∙	Just me building this. No team, no funding, lots of coffee.

Stuff I’ve learned along the way:

∙	The average person is on 50+ broker sites. When I tell people this they don’t believe me until they see their own results.

∙	Most companies completely ignore deletion requests. Which sounds bad but is actually the whole opportunity. Every ignored request is a potential legal violation.

∙	Barely anyone knows they have these rights. That’s the biggest gap I’m trying to close.

I don’t have everything figured out. The business model is still evolving and I’m learning something new basically every week. But privacy laws are only getting stricter and people are starting to actually care about this stuff, so the timing feels right.

Genuine question, what would actually get you to care enough to do something about your data? Is it the privacy side of things, or does knowing you could get compensated when companies ignore you change the equation?

Would love any feedback. Tell me what sucks, what’s missing, whatever.

Lorelai and Chris observe Rory feeling confident in her role when they first walk into the newsroom in this episode, but it's her leadership after the war protest that I think is a great addition. She and Logan helped save the paper in S6, and now in S7 we get to see Rory lead a less intensive but still important moment for the paper. 

Rory knows which stories are most significant to tell, has a quick plan for adapting the paper, and has a good enough relationship with the other staffers for them to trust her judgement on getting moving immediately even when they're not in the mood to - that last strength being the opposite of Paris' staff relationships as an editor. Rory leading the newsroom here feels more organic than leading community service in S6 to me because she has small encouraging moments with staffers in other episodes before this like telling Joni not to tell lab guys intimidate her while working on a story and trying to give Bill a chance to relax over Valentine's Day instead of writing (both in A Vineyard Valentine). 

I would've liked to see more of the action. Still, since the episode is mostly about Lorelai and Chris' perspective at Parents' Day, I like that it ends with them bringing Rory the classic Gilmore fuel of coffee and donuts to make up for accidentally getting the crew drunk.",6,1770346378.0,GilmoreGirls,1,0.88,False

We've been dating for six months almost and it's also our senior year. We have band and a two hour long shop class together, and then we eat lunch together, but I really don't get to see him at all. During these class periods he only wants to talk to his buddies, which like obviously I'm gonna let him talk to his friends, and like we walk together between classes and get lunch to ourselves. However, I like don't get to see him at all outside of school because his parents keep cancelling all of our plans, so right now school is really all we have and like he can only call on his way home from practice because his parents are taking his phone until he finishes a class.

Here's the thing though, is that when we're in our shop class our teacher will sometimes put us two together, but even then he'll leave to go tell his buddies something. He gets annoyed when I tell him we're not done and need to finish something. Here's the thing, is that the buddies in this class aren't even really nice to him and it kinda hurts my feelings that he gives more attention to people who are kinda mean to him over me. These last few weeks though he's been like extra bad about it, and like it feels like he's pulling away from affection and would rather spend time with his buddies than me. He seems kinda upset sometimes when he has to work with me and I ask if he's okay and he just says he's tired, but the second he's near his buddies he's all energetic. 

This week though, I've kinda been on him about it. I asked him yesterday if he was ignoring me and pointed out how he's not super affectionate anymore and how I feel ignored and like I did something wrong. He said he's not upset at me and he's not ignoring me, but I still feel like it. Today I asked him on our call if he could just maybe put in a little more effort, like seeing if we could find a time to hang out or something, and I asked if he even wanted to hang out because I'm the only one ever asking to hang out if feels like. He got quiet and when I asked if he was okay he complained about his parents and then got mad when I asked what was wrong.

I don't tell him this stuff to be mean or to make him feel bad, I just hate feeling left out and ignored, especially by my own boyfriend and I just want to feel like he cares. I get he needs his time with his buddies, and he complains to me all the time that he doesn't even get to see his friends, but I told him all I wanted was just to be prioritized a little bit. I told him I know it's mainly his parents' fault, but he still seemed upset. I don't know if I was too harsh on him or if I'm being too needy. I apologized and said I just really miss him and he said he missed me too, but I still feel like I'm not being a good girlfriend. I try so hard to support him and make him feel loved though, I buy us coffee every day and I bring him food from my work, and I compliment him and I try to show that I want to be around him and I love him, and all I want is just some of that returned sometimes. 

Was I being too harsh and needy? Is there something I should do to make it up to him?

1qx5tic,https://v.redd.it/nx7cdd03gshg1,"Are we actually living in a giant sandbox? Let’s talk about the ""Glitches""","I was up way too late last night spiraling down a rabbit hole about the **Simulation Hypothesis**, and I’ve gotta be honest—it’s messing with my head. I spend most of my time writing about the Metaverse we’re *building*, but lately, I’ve been looking at the world around me and wondering if we’re already inside one.

Think about it for a second. In my day job, I see how fast game engines are evolving. We’re getting to a point where digital water and light look indistinguishable from the real thing. If we can do that in 50 years of computing, what does a civilization a million years ahead of us look like? They wouldn't just be playing games; they’d be running entire universes.

**A few things that feel like ""System Requirements"" to me:**

* **The Speed of Light:** Why is there a speed limit? It feels like a hardcoded hardware bottleneck. The ""processor"" of our universe can't compute anything faster than $c$.
* **The Planck Length:** If you zoom in far enough on a screen, you see pixels. If you zoom in far enough on reality, you hit the Planck scale where physics just... stops rendering.
* **The Observer Effect:** The fact that subatomic particles change behavior just because they’re being watched? That’s literally just **frustum culling**. Why waste processing power on things the player isn't looking at?

I don't think we’re just mindless NPCs, but man, some of those ""glitches"" people talk about (the Mandela Effect, weird Deja Vu, objects disappearing) make me wonder if the server is just lagging.

I personally struggle with the idea that my morning coffee is just code, but the math is getting harder to ignore. If we're in a sim, I just hope the ""Devs"" don't decide to hit the reset button anytime soon.

**I’m curious what you guys think:** Have any of you ever had a ""glitch in the matrix"" moment that you absolutely couldn’t explain away with logic? Or do you think this is all just us overcomplicating a very physical reality?

1qx5rv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Empowish/comments/1qx5rv7/failed_at_habit_tracking_4_times_until_i_finally/,"Failed at habit tracking 4 times until I finally embraced the ""minimum viable habit"" approach (stuck with it for 60 days) 💪","If you've ever tried to build a new habit, enthusiastically downloaded a fancy tracker app, and then found yourself staring at a growing chain of red X's just a week later – *I see you*. I’ve been there. Four times, to be exact, I set out with grand plans to meditate daily, write every morning, or stretch consistently, only to completely fall off the wagon, feeling like a total failure each time.

My last attempt was particularly disheartening. I'd set up an elaborate Notion dashboard, complete with daily journaling prompts, a detailed workout plan, and a list of books to read. It looked *perfect* on paper, but the sheer cognitive load of just *tracking* it all, let alone *doing* it, became overwhelming. I realized that my problem wasn't a lack of desire or even discipline; it was a fundamental flaw in my *approach*. I was aiming for 100% perfection from day one, and any deviation felt like a complete collapse. *The 'aha!' moment hit me*: What if I stopped chasing perfect and started chasing *possible*?

That's when I stumbled upon the concept of the **Minimum Viable Habit (MVH)**, inspired by various productivity gurus and my own desperation. It's about stripping a habit down to its absolute, non-negotiable, ridiculously small core, so small you *can't* fail. Here’s how I finally made it stick:

1.  **Identify Your Core 'Why'**: Before anything else, understand *why* you want this habit. For me, meditation wasn't just 'good for me'; it was about reducing anxiety and improving focus. *Knowing this kept me going when 1 minute felt pointless.*
2.  **Strip It Down to Bare Bones**: This is the MVH in action.
    *   Instead of 'meditate for 30 minutes,' I committed to **'meditate for 1 minute.'**
    *   Instead of 'write 500 words,' it became **'write 1 sentence.'**
    *   Instead of 'do a full workout,' it was **'do 5 push-ups'** (or even 1, if 5 felt too much).
    *   *The key is to make it so easy you'd feel silly NOT doing it.*
3.  **Stack with an Existing Trigger**: Don't rely on willpower. Link your MVH to something you *already* do without fail.
    *   My 1-minute meditation became 'after I turn off my alarm, I will sit for 1 minute.'
    *   My 1 sentence of writing was 'after I pour my coffee, I will open my journal for 60 seconds.'
4.  **Track *Only* Consistency**: Forget duration, quality, or perfection initially. My tracker (a simple tick mark on a calendar or a basic app like Streaks) only cared: *Did I do the MVH today? Yes/No.* A single checkmark was a win.
5.  **Gradually Increase (Only When Solid)**: After about 3-4 weeks of *consistent* 1-minute meditations, I might naturally feel like doing 2 minutes, then 3. But I never *forced* it. The goal was consistency first, intensity second. If a busy day hit, I reverted to my MVH without guilt.

This isn't a magic fix, and I had my share of stumbles. There were days I *almost* skipped my 1-minute meditation, especially when I was stressed or running late. *I remember one particularly crazy Tuesday where I literally sat down, closed my eyes for 30 seconds, and then jumped up for my meeting, but it still counted as a win.* The biggest mistake I made initially was trying to increase too soon. I'd get a few good weeks in, feel confident, and then jump to a 10-minute meditation, only to fall off again. *It taught me the hard way: slow and steady truly wins the race here.* This approach might not be for you if you need to hit intense performance metrics from day one, but if your goal is sustainable, long-term habit formation, it's gold. Give it at least 30-60 days before you expect to see substantial shifts in automaticity.

After 60 days of religiously sticking to my MVHs, the shift was incredible. I now consistently meditate for 5-10 minutes most days, write a full page in my journal without conscious effort, and do a quick 10-minute stretch routine every morning. It’s not about the individual habits anymore; it's about the *momentum* and the *proof* to myself that I *can* build habits. My internal monologue has shifted from 'I always fail' to 'I am capable of showing up.' I feel less overwhelmed, more in control, and genuinely excited to tackle bigger goals because I trust my process now.

1qx5poa,https://www.reddit.com/r/B2BEventMarketing/comments/1qx5poa/what_actually_moves_attendees_from_curiosity_to/,What actually moves attendees from curiosity to booked meetings at B2B events?,"Curiosity at an event is common. People wander booths, join sessions, grab a coffee and say yes to a demo in theory. Turning that curiosity into a committed, scheduled meeting is where most programs fail. I’ve seen the same pattern at small roundtables and 2,000-person conferences: lots of initial interest, few confirmed meetings, and even fewer meaningful conversations.

🧭 What’s actually happening beneath the surface
Attendees juggle competing priorities, skepticism, and a fear of wasting time. Curiosity is low-effort. Booking a meeting signals commitment and risk. So the real job of event marketing is to lower perceived risk and raise perceived value at the exact moment someone is deciding whether to commit. That’s more psychology and timing than clever swag or aggressive follow-up.

🔧 Practical principles that move people from curious to committed
Make the benefit concrete and immediate. Vague promises do not convert. Instead of “learn about our solution,” lead with the specific outcome of a 20-minute meeting: what decision it helps them make, what data you’ll review, or what benchmark you’ll share. People sign up for outcomes, not demos.

Create micro-commitments before the event. Short pre-event interactions like a 5-minute pre-call, a tailored agenda email, or a quick qualifier survey turn passive interest into active investment. Each small yes increases the likelihood of a follow-through yes.

Reduce the mental and scheduling friction. Offer clear time windows, an easy calendar add, and a short agenda. If a meeting requires negotiation or a long form, people will deprioritize it. Keep the ask specific and the calendar logistics trivial.

Signal credibility in context. At events people are wary of vendor pitches. Use peer proof, relevant case snippets, or a named outcome that shows you know their industry. When the meeting feels like a peer conversation about a real problem, it becomes attractive rather than salesy.

Treat the meeting like a handoff, not a product demo. Prepare both sides. Send a one-page primer to the attendee and a tailored briefing to the host. That lowers the risk of a wasted meeting and increases confidence to commit.

🔁 A different way to see events
Stop treating events as single moments and start treating them as systems that prime, convert, and reinforce. Measure the quality of booked meetings, show-up rates, and the trust you earn over time. Attendance numbers are easy to chase. Signal-to-noise, calendar conversions, and repeat interactions are where real pipeline comes from.

This is how MyWebGlory approaches event marketing: thinking in outcomes, reducing friction, and building trust across the event lifecycle. For a concise overview of that mindset, see https://mywebglory.com/event-marketing

I changed my sheets and washed my comforter.

I lit my scented candles.

I watered my plants.

I cleaned the kitchen and the bathroom.

I did the groceries and bought only what I needed: coffee grounds and enough chicken breast for the week.

I picked up freshly baked bread from our local bakery.

I ate hot, fresh meals for lunch every day, no takeout because I am saving money.

I have been walking outside to get fresh air and reach my 5,000 steps.

I completed two interviews, one part time and one full time, both work from home.

I met up with friends last Monday and Tuesday.

I am realizing that living simply feels better and healthier. My savings can sustain me for about two months, yet I am not as worried as I expected to be. I always thought I would panic if this ever happened. I have been working for nine years, and this is the first time I do not have a job, but instead of fear, I feel light as a feather. No corporate pressure, no unnecessary stress, just learning to live in the moment.

Maybe after this season of my life, I will be able to look back and remember that small steps can go a long way. Living simply, without chasing so many material things, is still truly living.

A homeowner just went ballistic on me after I set a boundary before a sit was even confirmed.  She asked me questions about my personal life which is fine but it was in a very interrogating way.  Why are you traveling here, what places do you go, why do you go to those places, what types of relationships do you have (sexuality), when was my last boyfriend? What type of mail will you get, details about my education, etc… 

She then asked me to come to her house.  I politely mentioned that I’m happy to get on a video call or meet somewhere mutual to see if it is the right fit.

I mentioned that I had questions as well before moving to the call phase but that I’m glad that I was able to answer her questions but also wanted to clarify a few things to see if it were a mutual fit.

I just wanted to warn others to not be afraid to set boundaries.  THS is a mutual exchange.  I respected her boundaries but she did not respect mine or give me an opportunity to ask questions to see if it were a good fit for me as well.

1qx5eau,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1qx5eau/they_said_it_was_a_cougar_im_not_so_sure/,They said it was a cougar. I'm not so sure.,"I remember the flashing lights. The distant sound of chatter over a radio. The familiar sound of water rocking against old wooden docks.



I stood there holding a backpack by my fingertips, stuck in the moment. I took in the big sunroom that had been converted into a dining area feeding into a kitchen. The lawn had been replaced with an asphalt parking lot.



The house I used to visit as a kid—the one with the old man who’d let me play on his dock—had been replaced by a little lakeside steak joint. I’d wanted to visit it just to see how things had changed. I’d even expected to grab a bite.



I didn’t expect to see a game warden questioning a sobbing, middle-aged blonde waitress who had been unlucky enough to find the body.



I didn’t expect to see the stretcher loading a black bag into the back of a white medical van. I wouldn’t call it traumatic, but something like that…



It sticks with you.



I’d left town ten years ago. It had been maybe five years before that when the whole “cougar” incident happened. Back then nobody believed me but my parents.



Nowadays it’s an accepted fact that there are mountain lions in this state. Not in this specific area, but it’s not unheard of for somebody to find remains—just a few scraps of deer or some other unlucky creature—deeper in the woods.



But they don’t come this close to civilization. Not really. The one or two that have wandered anywhere near this area usually get shot under the excuse of “protecting livestock.” I don’t really agree with it, but most of the hunters around here would jump at the chance to get a pelt like that for their wall.



It was quite the shock to the little community to find out that somebody had seemingly been mauled by one. The guy was apparently working late to prep some steaks for an event later in the week and had failed to notice something creeping up behind him when he went out back to have a smoke.



The cameras didn’t catch most of it. The guy was just standing there enjoying a cowboy-killer when something caught his attention. It shows him leaning forward to look at something, cigarette still in hand, taking a couple steps out of frame—and then he just never showed back up again. She found him just a few feet away. Neck twisted and mangled. A chunk taken out of his arm.



I really could’ve done without those details. The mental image wasn’t pretty.



The warden was a cousin of mine, and he definitely liked to talk—maybe a little too enthusiastically considering what it was about. I guess it got boring dealing with the usual reports of people trying to take a buck out of season or the odd fisherman who “forgot” his license.



His best idea so far was that a local cougar might’ve gotten wounded and was just trying to get one of the pets when the poor guy happened to come across it mid-hunt. Apparently, you starve something enough and it starts to ignore instinct.



Still, after my own run-in, I’d gotten a little fixated on cougars, and one detail stuck with me. They’d found the body so close to what seemed to be the kill site. Cougars don’t really operate like that. They drag kills into cover—somewhere they can eat without worrying about other predators.



If they can drag a deer, why not a guy?



And another thing—there are definitely easier options. There are chicken coops all over the place and even a few people who raise goats a ways out of town. I could’ve just been reading into things too much, but it still nagged at me.



Somewhere in the background I heard some kid bugging his mom about breakfast. I guess the place was pretty popular around here, as cars kept driving by. Might’ve just been rubberneckers.



I had plenty of time to think the whole thing over as I sat down on the old dock. I still remember swimming in those green waters as a kid. I popped in an earbud, leaned back against a post, and took a deep breath of faintly fish-scented air.



The original plan was for me to meet my cousin here, have a bite, and have him drop me off with my folks. But considering what was going on, he’d be too tied up to taxi me around, and my uncle was already miles away driving to a job site. We planned to be down there a week or two, then after the job was done he’d drive us back home.



It didn’t feel like a long wait, but it was still a relief seeing my dad’s faded red pickup easing down the road.



I pulled my earbud out and held out my arms.



It was still awkward hugging him, but it had become a habit after Grandpa passed. You never know when you’re going to see family again. He gave me a firm pat on the back before pulling away and letting me toss my bag into the cab of his truck.



I caught sight of somebody hanging a sign up on the diner’s door—big bold letters reading CLOSED.



The ride home was quiet. I loved him, but we didn’t have much in common. He loved football. I liked video games. We only really got talking when it came to work—building a fence, planning a garden, or doing minor repairs for the local vet.



Mom, on the other hand, couldn’t wait to fill me in on all the local gossip. I played along to keep her happy. She was a good mother, and it was the least I could do.



Then, of course, the topic turned to the incident down by the lake.



Dad brought it up without looking at me, working his way through a forkful of pot roast.



“What was all that about at the diner?”



“Oh—uh. Some guy got attacked, I guess.”



Mom looked up from her phone.



“What?”



Not panicked. Almost excited.



I ran them through what I knew. When I mentioned my cousin, Mom pushed back from the table, chair legs scraping as she brought her phone up to her ear. She’d always been into true crime. This probably felt like one of her stories.



Around another mouthful of roast, Dad asked, “You ready for this weekend?”



I paused, fork halfway to my mouth.



“We’re still doing that?”



He bunched up a napkin and wiped his mouth.



“What, just ’cause there’s a cougar you think we’re gonna skip the pig hunt?”



I wanted to say something back—maybe suggest we put it off—but that wasn’t really an option. I was leaving in two weeks, and one attack didn’t necessarily mean the woods were suddenly any more dangerous than they always were.



See, hogs were getting bad around there. Honestly, an angry hog is probably worse than a cougar. They don’t need a reason like hunger to want you dead—they just have to be in the right mood.



You didn’t need a license to clear them out. They were considered pests. Most folks didn’t even eat them—too many parasites—but some still did.



Dad was one of them. He made a really good roast, and as long as you cooked them thoroughly there really wasn’t much risk.



He went out when work died down, a chance to nab a few of the local sows and fill up the freezer he kept in the carport. After a few years away from home, he’d finally managed to convince me to join him for a hunt.



I wasn’t much of an outdoorsman anymore. I’d had enough of that as a kid. But we hadn’t really done anything together, and it didn’t get much more “father-son bonding time” than hunting.



The rest of the week went by pretty peacefully. Mom had me help her make and jar some homemade pickles. Dad brought me out to a small repair job on a neighbor’s deck for some pocket change.



I even got to see a few of my cousins. It was a bit awkward, but it still felt good to see what used to be a gap-toothed brat married and making an honest living.



Poor Aunt Sarah’s pit bull had apparently wandered off. We made sure to bring her some pickles. She’d had that dog since it was a pup. It had disappeared once or twice before, but never for more than a day. This time it had been gone for nearly a week. I still remember the pictures Mom used to send from family get-togethers—Aunt Sarah always holding that big brown pup’s paw up to wave at the camera.



On a normal hunt, you’d get up really early. Not with hogs. Feral hogs aren’t like your normal barnyard pig—they’re nocturnal.



The best way to hunt them is to bait a place for a few weeks and then set up a tree stand to take them out. Dad had picked a spot deep in the woods, not too far from some wallows.



We went out Friday to toss another bucket of scraps. It gave me a chance to get a good look at the setup. I didn’t really like heights, and it was a solid fifteen feet of climbing a ladder up to what essentially amounted to a camo chair strapped to a tree.



Still, it felt good knowing we were going to be doing something together—especially since that something involved a good excuse not to talk.



I guess he saw how nervous I was staring up at the tree, because he gave the stand a firm shake.



“Still solid.”



On the trek back home, something caught my eye. Off in the distance I saw a bit of a black blur. I don’t remember exactly, but I’m pretty confident it was a hog’s head poking out from behind some brush.



It didn’t seem to be paying me any special attention. It definitely saw us, but it just wasn’t reacting. Hogs are usually nocturnal, but sightings during the day aren’t exactly unheard of.



Still, it felt weird.



Normally a wild hog will either run or, if you’re unlucky, get aggressive. This one just flicked its ears when Dad stepped on something in the brush that let out a decent crack.



It shifted its head in my direction, and for a moment I think it really looked at me. I paused mid-step as I stared back at the thing. For a good second or two, the only real sound was my dad’s footsteps crunching through the leaf litter.



Just as I opened my mouth to mention it to Dad—who had already gotten a good few feet ahead of me—the pig finally moved, slowly turning away from us and back into the brush.



I took it as a sign that they’d just been getting used to people. Not a great sign, but not unheard of either.



We made some half-hearted attempts at small talk. Dad pointed out a few signs to keep an eye out for—wallows where the pigs rooted up dirt, low marks on trees where they rubbed against them.



I tried to explain a little about a sports game I thought he might like, but I doubt he was really listening.



I was thankful when my old backyard finally came into view. The spot under the big tree still had a few large rocks marking where our old dog had been buried.



I spent the rest of that night doing a little research. I’d never had much reason to look into pigs, but I figured I might as well.



Turns out they’re smart. Like, scary smart. They can learn patterns, figure out how to open latches, and some studies say they might even remember faces.



It made me wonder what the last one I saw had been thinking. Made me wonder if it remembered Dad, and that’s why it didn’t really focus on him—just eyed me.



That felt a little off.



I didn’t love the idea of something I was possibly about to take potshots at remembering my face.



I went to bed that night with my phone plugged in and charging, and I dreamed of old, musty shacks and hog wallows.



The next morning Mom fed us a classic southern breakfast—eggs, bacon, and coffee. Dad still liked his black, but I never took him seriously when he poked fun at me for adding milk to mine.



We spent the day mostly relaxing. Dad watched sports reruns while Mom idly chatted about some woman who’d murdered her husband over something petty.



It went by quick.



I still remember the chirp of Dad’s watch announcing it was finally time to make the trek back into the woods.



It was a solid thirty-minute walk, and we had maybe an hour or so before sundown. When I asked my dad how we were going to haul the meat back, he mentioned leaving a couple of game carts hidden nearby.



It made sense the way he described it, figuring we’d both take a sow each and drag them back on the carts after he field-gutted them.



Once we got about halfway to the feed site, the conversation died down. Dad explained that while the hogs probably wouldn’t hear us this far out, it wasn’t worth risking it.



It was getting dark by the time the bait pile was visible.



Dad didn’t like what he saw.



Coyotes.



Not a lot of them, but enough to make it clear the little bastards had been eating the food left out to draw in the hogs. It turned from a hog hunt to a coyote clearing real fast.



Dad had a temper—not against me or Mom—but he’d definitely thrown something once or twice when angry. Right now, “throwing something” meant chambering a round and drawing a bead on the first coyote he could.



His finger hovered over the trigger. I could visibly see the shake in the gun as he held some quiet debate about shooting or not.



Finally, he lowered the barrel and let out an angry call.



“GIT! GIT! YOU DAMN MUTTS!”



He charged forward, causing the pack to scatter.



I’d say I was worried for him, but coyotes generally aren’t that aggressive toward people, and honestly, seeing any around here is rare. A few towns over they’re a real pest, but for whatever reason they never got this close to our neck of the woods.



Still, every once in a blue moon one would show up.



Our bad luck—it happened to be where we were hunting.



Dad took a few steps and kicked at some half-eaten scraps covered in white-blue mold.



“Little bastards. Hopefully the smell will still draw the hogs.”



He climbed up to his stand, grumbling something about the piss scaring them off. His voice faded slightly amid the light metal \*tunk\* of him working his way up.



I took another glance at the treeline where the coyotes had scattered. I figured that would probably be the worst thing we’d run into all night—just some wild dogs looking for an easy meal.



I’d prove myself wrong.



Dark moved in faster than I thought it would. It felt like I’d just gotten up into the stand when the last bit of visible light faded out and the crickets started chirping so loud I could barely hear the rustle of leaves in the wind.



Dad had given me a high-powered flashlight and said, “When you hear them, wait for me to turn on mine and then start firing.” I figured the light would blind a few.



It felt weird just sitting there. I could barely make out the area around me when the moon peeked out from behind some clouds and threw pale light across a few spots.



I don’t know how long it was exactly, but at some point I got bored and pulled out my phone. I figured if I kept the screen dim and popped in an earbud on low, Dad wouldn’t notice.



I was wrong.



A minute into the first song in my playlist, something small hit my dangling leg from roughly Dad’s direction. I figured he’d seen the phone’s glow, so I turned the screen off.



A minute later, another pebble hit me—harder this time.



I don’t know how he knew. Maybe his hearing was better than I’d given him credit for. I stopped the music and quietly tucked my earbud away.



And the night just went on.



A solid few hours with my legs dangling above what looked like black nothingness.



I never did well with not having something solid beneath me. It always felt like there’d be something there. It’s the same reason I never liked swimming in deep water—that sensation that I don’t really know what’s below me made my skin crawl.



Then we heard it.



The first snort.



The sound of shuffling and huffing as something moved beneath us toward the remains of the bait pile.



I barely heard the leaves rustle. They moved quieter than I could’ve imagined. But everything’s got to breathe, and these things were really taking it in.



The light nearly blinded me as much as it did the hog. I clicked my flashlight on and let my eyes adjust as I tried to get a bead on the first moving blur of black.



It was just two of them.



I couldn’t tell you if they were male or female, or one of each, but it wasn’t the pack Dad had expected—just a pair.



I flinched and pulled the trigger when the first crack of a gunshot made me jolt.



One dropped.



The other squealed—almost screamed—and took off into the night.



I gritted my teeth and let out a low hiss as my mistake hit me.



I’d hit it somewhere in the torso, that I was sure of, but there was no guarantee I’d hit anything vital. The fact I could hear it crashing through the woods made me doubt it.



The guilt crept in fast and hard as I realized I’d probably just sentenced it to a slow bleed-out.



I heard Dad clambering down, the clunk of him climbing the ladder almost obnoxiously loud in the silence.



“C’mon! We gotta go finish her off!”



He sounded excited—moving quicker than I’d seen him in a long time as he passed by his own hog.



I’d barely gotten my feet on the ground when his silhouette started to disappear into the darkness.



“Hurry up!” he called back, his footsteps heavy in the dark, the only real clue to where he’d gone.



I turned my flashlight toward the ground and noticed a splash of red trailing off into the night.



I moved, but the sounds got farther away.



I wasn’t used to navigating through brush like this. More than once my foot caught on something and made me stumble.



Soon I wasn’t listening for the crash of leaves anymore—just following the spatters of red.



I slowed to a walk, taking deep breaths of cool night air as I tried to get my bearings.



I adjusted the strap of my rifle, which had been slipping down my shoulder the entire jog, and tried to make sense of my surroundings.



I was moving toward a thick patch of brambles and trees, and I still couldn’t hear anything other than the obnoxious chirp of crickets.



I wasn’t worried so much about getting lost as I was about Dad wandering out here alone.



A loud crack somewhere off to my right jolted me hard enough that the flashlight slipped out of my sweat-soaked hand.



I held my breath as it hit the forest floor, waiting for the light to cut out and leave me blind.



I only exhaled after realizing it was still shining.



I dropped to a knee and scooped it up.



It took a second, but I spotted the blood trail again. It looked like it led toward the sound, and I hoped it was Dad finishing off the wounded animal.



I broke back into a light jog, struggling to keep the beam on the blood spatters until they led me to a thick wall of trees.



The red pointed toward a break in the treeline where tall saplings filled the gap.



Another sound brought me to a sudden stop, momentum carrying me one step farther.



Crunch.



It came from right ahead—and slightly up.



I let my flashlight trail from the blood on the ground to a particularly tall sapling, just above head height.



The hog’s head poking out from behind it was standing taller still.



Something was held above its mouth, pinched between two fingers.



A paw.



I saw its pupil shrink in the light—quick and reflexive.



I held my beam there for what felt like forever as it slowly slid out of view.



My mouth went dry. My chest tightened.



I took a step back.



A gentle rustle made me snap the light downward.



A snout stuck out from behind the tree, a foot or two off the ground, twitching as it sniffed the air with soft snorts.



I stepped back again and watched it move less fluidly—head bobbing slightly, like a normal pig walking out of the treeline.



It moved just far enough for me to see its eyes.



A shout came from my left—Dad calling my name.



It made me look away for just a second.



When I turned back, the head was gone.



The only sign it had been there was a slight shake of the tree and the distant sound of rustling moving away.



I moved faster then, awkwardly jogging while keeping my head and light fixed on that spot until I’d put some distance between us.



Then I broke into a sprint.



I never looked back. I don’t know if it followed me, but the thought that it might have was enough.



When I saw a break in the dark ahead—Dad shining a beam of white light down on a collapsed hog—I finally found enough sense to yell.



“GO! Go, go, go!”



I half-stumbled into the light. Dad’s face went from a toothy grin to confusion.



I didn’t explain. I just grabbed a fistful of his coat and shoved him along.



To his credit, he listened.



On the way back, he managed to slow me down enough to get me talking, but all it did was convince him I’d found a cougar’s kill up in a tree.



By the time we got home, Mom was already asleep, and Dad decided we’d go back for the kills in the morning.



I didn’t get any sleep.



We went back at sunrise.



We tracked our way to where I’d been. There were two blood trails. One led to my hog.



The other led to the tree.



There was still half a coyote behind it.



Dad took that as more proof of a cougar.



Another person got mauled yesterday—the Vietnamese guy who ran the local chicken house.



Mauled inside his own coop.



None of the chickens were touched.



Something got to him inside the coop.



But it left all the chickens.

1qx5e8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qx5e8d/they_said_it_was_a_cougar_im_not_so_sure/,They said it was a cougar. I'm not so sure.,"I remember the flashing lights. The distant sound of chatter over a radio. The familiar sound of water rocking against old wooden docks.



I stood there holding a backpack by my fingertips, stuck in the moment. I took in the big sunroom that had been converted into a dining area feeding into a kitchen. The lawn had been replaced with an asphalt parking lot.



The house I used to visit as a kid—the one with the old man who’d let me play on his dock—had been replaced by a little lakeside steak joint. I’d wanted to visit it just to see how things had changed. I’d even expected to grab a bite.



I didn’t expect to see a game warden questioning a sobbing, middle-aged blonde waitress who had been unlucky enough to find the body.



I didn’t expect to see the stretcher loading a black bag into the back of a white medical van. I wouldn’t call it traumatic, but something like that…



It sticks with you.



I’d left town ten years ago. It had been maybe five years before that when the whole “cougar” incident happened. Back then nobody believed me but my parents.



Nowadays it’s an accepted fact that there are mountain lions in this state. Not in this specific area, but it’s not unheard of for somebody to find remains—just a few scraps of deer or some other unlucky creature—deeper in the woods.



But they don’t come this close to civilization. Not really. The one or two that have wandered anywhere near this area usually get shot under the excuse of “protecting livestock.” I don’t really agree with it, but most of the hunters around here would jump at the chance to get a pelt like that for their wall.



It was quite the shock to the little community to find out that somebody had seemingly been mauled by one. The guy was apparently working late to prep some steaks for an event later in the week and had failed to notice something creeping up behind him when he went out back to have a smoke.



The cameras didn’t catch most of it. The guy was just standing there enjoying a cowboy-killer when something caught his attention. It shows him leaning forward to look at something, cigarette still in hand, taking a couple steps out of frame—and then he just never showed back up again. She found him just a few feet away. Neck twisted and mangled. A chunk taken out of his arm.



I really could’ve done without those details. The mental image wasn’t pretty.



The warden was a cousin of mine, and he definitely liked to talk—maybe a little too enthusiastically considering what it was about. I guess it got boring dealing with the usual reports of people trying to take a buck out of season or the odd fisherman who “forgot” his license.



His best idea so far was that a local cougar might’ve gotten wounded and was just trying to get one of the pets when the poor guy happened to come across it mid-hunt. Apparently, you starve something enough and it starts to ignore instinct.



Still, after my own run-in, I’d gotten a little fixated on cougars, and one detail stuck with me. They’d found the body so close to what seemed to be the kill site. Cougars don’t really operate like that. They drag kills into cover—somewhere they can eat without worrying about other predators.



If they can drag a deer, why not a guy?



And another thing—there are definitely easier options. There are chicken coops all over the place and even a few people who raise goats a ways out of town. I could’ve just been reading into things too much, but it still nagged at me.



Somewhere in the background I heard some kid bugging his mom about breakfast. I guess the place was pretty popular around here, as cars kept driving by. Might’ve just been rubberneckers.



I had plenty of time to think the whole thing over as I sat down on the old dock. I still remember swimming in those green waters as a kid. I popped in an earbud, leaned back against a post, and took a deep breath of faintly fish-scented air.



The original plan was for me to meet my cousin here, have a bite, and have him drop me off with my folks. But considering what was going on, he’d be too tied up to taxi me around, and my uncle was already miles away driving to a job site. We planned to be down there a week or two, then after the job was done he’d drive us back home.



It didn’t feel like a long wait, but it was still a relief seeing my dad’s faded red pickup easing down the road.



I pulled my earbud out and held out my arms.



It was still awkward hugging him, but it had become a habit after Grandpa passed. You never know when you’re going to see family again. He gave me a firm pat on the back before pulling away and letting me toss my bag into the cab of his truck.



I caught sight of somebody hanging a sign up on the diner’s door—big bold letters reading CLOSED.



The ride home was quiet. I loved him, but we didn’t have much in common. He loved football. I liked video games. We only really got talking when it came to work—building a fence, planning a garden, or doing minor repairs for the local vet.



Mom, on the other hand, couldn’t wait to fill me in on all the local gossip. I played along to keep her happy. She was a good mother, and it was the least I could do.



Then, of course, the topic turned to the incident down by the lake.



Dad brought it up without looking at me, working his way through a forkful of pot roast.



“What was all that about at the diner?”



“Oh—uh. Some guy got attacked, I guess.”



Mom looked up from her phone.



“What?”



Not panicked. Almost excited.



I ran them through what I knew. When I mentioned my cousin, Mom pushed back from the table, chair legs scraping as she brought her phone up to her ear. She’d always been into true crime. This probably felt like one of her stories.



Around another mouthful of roast, Dad asked, “You ready for this weekend?”



I paused, fork halfway to my mouth.



“We’re still doing that?”



He bunched up a napkin and wiped his mouth.



“What, just ’cause there’s a cougar you think we’re gonna skip the pig hunt?”



I wanted to say something back—maybe suggest we put it off—but that wasn’t really an option. I was leaving in two weeks, and one attack didn’t necessarily mean the woods were suddenly any more dangerous than they always were.



See, hogs were getting bad around there. Honestly, an angry hog is probably worse than a cougar. They don’t need a reason like hunger to want you dead—they just have to be in the right mood.



You didn’t need a license to clear them out. They were considered pests. Most folks didn’t even eat them—too many parasites—but some still did.



Dad was one of them. He made a really good roast, and as long as you cooked them thoroughly there really wasn’t much risk.



He went out when work died down, a chance to nab a few of the local sows and fill up the freezer he kept in the carport. After a few years away from home, he’d finally managed to convince me to join him for a hunt.



I wasn’t much of an outdoorsman anymore. I’d had enough of that as a kid. But we hadn’t really done anything together, and it didn’t get much more “father-son bonding time” than hunting.



The rest of the week went by pretty peacefully. Mom had me help her make and jar some homemade pickles. Dad brought me out to a small repair job on a neighbor’s deck for some pocket change.



I even got to see a few of my cousins. It was a bit awkward, but it still felt good to see what used to be a gap-toothed brat married and making an honest living.



Poor Aunt Sarah’s pit bull had apparently wandered off. We made sure to bring her some pickles. She’d had that dog since it was a pup. It had disappeared once or twice before, but never for more than a day. This time it had been gone for nearly a week. I still remember the pictures Mom used to send from family get-togethers—Aunt Sarah always holding that big brown pup’s paw up to wave at the camera.



On a normal hunt, you’d get up really early. Not with hogs. Feral hogs aren’t like your normal barnyard pig—they’re nocturnal.



The best way to hunt them is to bait a place for a few weeks and then set up a tree stand to take them out. Dad had picked a spot deep in the woods, not too far from some wallows.



We went out Friday to toss another bucket of scraps. It gave me a chance to get a good look at the setup. I didn’t really like heights, and it was a solid fifteen feet of climbing a ladder up to what essentially amounted to a camo chair strapped to a tree.



Still, it felt good knowing we were going to be doing something together—especially since that something involved a good excuse not to talk.



I guess he saw how nervous I was staring up at the tree, because he gave the stand a firm shake.



“Still solid.”



On the trek back home, something caught my eye. Off in the distance I saw a bit of a black blur. I don’t remember exactly, but I’m pretty confident it was a hog’s head poking out from behind some brush.



It didn’t seem to be paying me any special attention. It definitely saw us, but it just wasn’t reacting. Hogs are usually nocturnal, but sightings during the day aren’t exactly unheard of.

On the way back, he managed to slow me down enough to get me talking, but all it did was convince him I’d found a cougar’s kill up in a tree.



By the time we got home, Mom was already asleep, and Dad decided we’d go back for the kills in the morning.



I didn’t get any sleep.



We went back at sunrise.



We tracked our way to where I’d been. There were two blood trails. One led to my hog.



The other led to the tree.



There was still half a coyote behind it.



Dad took that as more proof of a cougar.



Another person got mauled yesterday—the Vietnamese guy who ran the local chicken house.



Mauled inside his own coop. None of the chickens were touched.



Something got to him inside the coop.



But left the chickens.

It didn't take long before life without Ratty seemed like a strange and distant memory to the newly-christened Mole.

Everything kept to a wonderful sort of schedule; when the sun rose, they woke up in a warm, secure little bundle, in whatever sleeping place they had found the evening before. More often than not, that meant some doorway in a coffee shop or bookstore that could keep any rain off them. Once the sun was higher, it was off to find something to eat to start the morning. If there was anything edible to be found, it would be shared.

""There we are, handsome. Got some nums,"" Ratty would say, and Mole would yip in response.

By the time the sun reached its apex, they'd likely done some exploring, passing through the green (his most favorite of places), or what Ratty called 'shopping' (grabbing old cloths from a bin before anyone could see them), or riding about on 'the bus' (if Ratty had managed to collect the magic metal bits that made it work). By the time the sun was heading down again, it was time to find another place to sleep.

It was hard to imagine how life could be better. Mole hoped it would never end. 

Mole was young, and had yet to learn how true it was that all things had to end. 

\*\*\* 

The sun was low and tiredness had crept up on Mole without his realization. He trotted along next to Ratty, secretly hoping she would think to lift him up and let him ride in the cart. To his mild disappointment, she did not offer. 

""Bad day, Mole. Wasn't it?"" 

Mole had loved every minute of the day, in fact, but if Ratty said it was a bad day, he was certain that had to be correct. 

""Used to love crashing at the park before they put in those new benches."" 

Mole nodded sagely. The benches! Of course. 

""I'd love to try the coffee place but we can't keep pestering Cam like that. 'd never say it, but we scare off the customers."" 

That was good, Mole thought. Wasn't it? Being scary meant other people would leave you be. Still, if Ratty didn't like it, it had to be wrong. 

""Guess it'll just be the alley for us tonight, boy. It'll be plenty cozy if we lay down some blankets. How's that sound?"" 

It sounded perfect. 

In the space between two brick walls, just opposite an old, faded Rainier Special advertisement, the two spread out a nest of cloths, nestled in close together and drifted off to sleep, stars almost peeking through the light-polluted gloom. For a moment, all was perfect. 

And within a moment, it was not. Mole awoke to realize they were not alone. Two other bigs had entered the alleyway, reeking of sweat and something else- burning wood? They were talking to one another, voices low, veined with emotions that made Mole uncomfortable. One was ashamed, the other choking down ugly laughter.  

^(""You see that? Whoosh! Place went up like a candle!"") 

^(""Shit. Shit. We shouldn't have. What if someone saw?"") 

^(""Nobody saw. Just relax."") 

^(""Could have been someone inside-"") 

^(""There wasn't. And if there was, who cares now?"") 

Mole, uncertain of what to do, drew his head back, arching up his shoulders. Perhaps they would leave. Best to just not be seen. Just don't be seen and they'll leave. 

Fate intervened. Ratty, still restless from the hard ground, roused by the intruders' whispers, stirred, and woke. And spoke. It happened slowly. Mole was aware of every second. 

""You two."" Groggy. Not fully awake. 

The two bigs froze. Mole smelled fear on them, a bitter note like the taste of metal on your tongue.  

^(""Shit. Shit. She can see us-"") 

^(""Just shut up! It's just some junkie-"")

""You move along,"" Ratty grumbled, still barely conscious. ""This here's our space."" 

The angrier and more afraid of the strange bigs snarled at Ratty, a word Mole was not familiar with. He was moving closer now. Mole let out a low warning growl. The stranger had to go away. He had to. 

""You best leave us alone-"" 

Suddenly it was a fight. Bigs fought with their paws, not usually with their teeth. Aside from that it was the same as a normal, terrifying and savage. The strange big grabbed Ratty, started to pound his hands against her; the other big whimpered and begged his friend to stop. Mole panicked. Ratty was being hurt. His Ratty. 

Without thinking, he sank his teeth into the attacker's exposed ankle, tasting shreds of skin and hearing shrieks of pain. The other big, the whimpering one, grabbed Mole by his back legs, tried to throw him off, and Mole thrashed and tried to bite whatever his mouth would reach. 

It was happening so fast, but it passed in front of his senses so slowly. 

The strange big shoved. Ratty stumbled. Her head struck something on the way down, and Mole's heart sank to hear the noise it made. He was bellowing now, barking louder than he thought he was able, and the two bigs were running, more scared than anyone Mole had met. He stood at the mouth of the alley, snarling and daring them to return. They didn't. 

Then Mole went to where his friend was lying, terribly, terribly still. 

Mole nudged Ratty's face and kissed her. She didn't budge. He squeezed in next to her. She didn't budge. 

The sun came up, as it always did; it was time to wake. Ratty never did. He nudged her again and it did no good. 

The sun got higher. It was time to find food. He nudged her again. *Wake up. Please.* 

The sun was at its top. Time to go shopping. He nudged her again. 

Ratty didn't get up. ",1,1770344640.0,StoriesPlentiful,1,1.0,False
1qx57ec,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1qx57ec/modesty_and_some_limited_nudity_thoughts/,Modesty and some limited nudity - thoughts?,"Hello. New around these parts. I'm considering a matter that I'm interested in perspectives on. Here are my thoughts:

In my (34M) family of two young boys and my wife we are generally fully dressed around each other, and we're all ok with that. We value modesty. However, around a shower or so at least with the males of the home it isn't uncommon to shower with the door open and walk through the hall naked before getting dressed. Nobody seems to mind this. My wife tends to be more modest around the kids and only changes clothes or showers with the door shut and gets dressed before leaving the bathroom. This is all fine.

Keeping in mind we value modesty, I'm considering the boundaries of this kind of nudity. For example, if the kids aren't around I'd commonly enough hang around nude a bit after a shower to fully dry out and, also, it's comfortable. I don't tend to do that when the kids are around to model modesty.

I also know that for some folks sleeping in the nude is their norm. I don't tend to do that (usually I at least wear underwear) but after a certain point in the evening when everyone is settled in for the night we would be lounging about, watching TV, reading books, etc. in pajamas or loungewear. This is where I'm considering possibly being more ""open"" to more nudity:

If it is that some of us sleep in just underwear or even nude, for this same period of time of the evening through the early morning when we'd get up for breakfast and such, I wonder if we can accept more open nudity like we would accept wearing pajamas around the house. This is assuming nobody else is home and it is just us family settled in for the night at home before going to bed. Perhaps limiting it to the upstairs where the bedrooms and bathroom are, maybe also the living room. I have a thought that this might be alright while otherwise maintaining and practicing modesty generally otherwise (e.g. in broad daylight around the house, for meals, etc. we'd be in clothes).

I really want to keep and uphold modesty, but also recognize the practical aspect to some nudity at home and role of home where we can be a bit more lax and comfortable and not expect the same amount of coverage in certain contexts, perhaps, compared to what we would in public, with guests around, or even in the full ""activity mode"" of the day. And this is, also, assuming everyone would be comfortable with it. Respect is also a high value such that more open nudity wouldn't be accepted if someone wasn't ok with it.

I'm not talking about sitting around having breakfast in the nude openly or anything like that. I'm thinking any meals would require clothing as a matter of modesty (as well as cleanliness, manners, etc.)  
What I'm talking about is more along the lines of taking a shower before bed, staying naked, getting a glass of water from the kitchen, sleeping nude, using bathroom in the morning, start a pot of coffee in the morning, all before getting dressed. And doing it all nude as long as nobody else is uncomfortable with it. And that goes for anyone in the home.  
Maybe allow sitting down to watch TV nude late at night? But that might be pushing it. Like I was saying, modesty is a value.

  
TL;DR Considering allowing more open nudity among just family members at home for a period at night and early in the morning but I don't want it to contradict a general family value and practice of modesty.

To be clear, too, exclusively non-sexual contexts as far as when any kids are around.

   1. Stay on beach and relax by water / learn to surf
2. Take Shuttle from ST > Tamarindo (staying for 3 nights)

   1. Volcano Hike, Waterfalls, Hot Springs, Coffee Farms
4. Take Shuttle from La Fortuna > Monteverde (staying for 2 nights)
   1. Cloud forrest, Birdwatching, relaxation before departure
5. Take Shuttle from Monteverde > San Jose and fly home following 2 weeks of travel

My questions are:

* Does my itinerary look realistic?
* Do shuttles make sense for this itinerary? I'm thinking at most I would rent a car to get from Tamarindo > La Fortuna and get around there but it seems like LF and MV are both very touristy and have shuttles for the various activities I want to do
   * Someone in another post mentioned using [https://www.bookaway.com/](https://www.bookaway.com/) where shuttles seem to be often enough and relatively affordable (\~$50-80) compared to a car rental between Tama and LF costing \~$650 at least. All in all this trip would cost \~$250 in shuttles vs. the 650+ some shuttling around on the peninsula.

Also side-note I'm very sociable and like meeting people / traveling around with them when abroad!

1qx53t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UndeadPoetSociety/comments/1qx53t4/the_delusional_bitch_chapters/,The delusional bitch chapters,"**note: this is an excerpt from “Delusional Bitch Chapters”**

He was just a delusional bitch. He didn’t know any better. He thought any human with a third leg who merely glanced at him was interested. And he was eating up the attention like it was medicine, like it was proof, like it was oxygen.

Not because he was irresistible. No.  
Because he was… available.

Hot enough to pity flirt with. Not hot enough to entertain anything more than a one skeet n yeet, if the mood was right and the standards were temporarily offline. The kind of face you compliment when you’re bored, then immediately regret because now you’ve bought a ticket to a conversation you never wanted to attend.

But he didn’t know that. He couldn’t know that.  
His brain was built like a haunted house and every hallway led to the same jump scare:

**THEY WANT ME.**

A cashier said “Have a nice day.”  
He heard, “Come ruin my life gently.”

A bartender said, “What can I get you?”  
He heard, “Your number. Your time. Your secrets.”

A stranger’s eyes passed over him for half a second, the normal amount a human checks if another human is about to walk directly into them. He took it like a marriage proposal delivered by laser beam.

His whole personality was a misunderstanding with a haircut.

He called it confidence. It was actually an allergy to reality.

# The Glance Economy

In his world, glances were currency. A look was a deposit. A smile was a mortgage. A laugh was a down payment on a fantasy condo with a view of “us” and “forever” and “you just get me.”

He walked around collecting micro-signals like they were trophies.  
A blink.  
A nod.  
A “my bad.”  
A “you go ahead.”

He stuffed them in his pocket like coins and later, alone, he’d count them out on the bed.

One. Two. Three.  
Proof. Evidence. A case file titled: **Everybody Wants Me, Actually.**

Meanwhile, the rest of humanity was just trying to buy drugs and survive the week.

# The Third Leg Think Tank

And yes, the third leg had opinions.  
The third leg was loud.  
The third leg held meetings without inviting the brain.

The third leg was convinced the world was one big flirtation waiting to happen, and every interaction was a trailer for a movie called *Finally, Somebody Recognizes My Greatness.*

His reality based cognition was on vacation. No forwarding address. No return date.

So he did what delusional bitches do best.  
He performed.

He leaned on counters like a man in a cologne commercial.  
He laughed at jokes that weren’t jokes.  
He “accidentally” brushed hands like he was starring in a romance, not making a transaction that should’ve stayed anonymous.

And when someone gave him the smallest sliver of attention, the kind you could hand out in a sample cup at Costco, he built a whole life out of it.

One compliment became an invitation.  
One invitation became a plan.  
One plan became a storyline.  
And the storyline became his entire religion.

He didn’t flirt, exactly.  
He *assumed.* With cardio.

# The Gym Incident

The gym was his favorite stage because everyone was already sweating, which meant the delusion had plausible deniability.

A guy adjusted the cable machine near him and said, “You using this?”  
He heard, “I’m using you, spiritually.”

A trainer nodded and said, “Good form.”  
He heard, “Good lord, marry me.”

He started doing this thing where he’d catch his reflection mid set and smirk, like the mirror was a crowd and the crowd was begging for an encore. He’d post a blurry thirst trap with a caption like “no caption needed.” Except, baby, it did need a caption. It needed a warning label and a court appointed guardian.

Three likes came in.  
One from his cousin.  
One from a bot.  
One from a woman who was nice to everybody because she was raised correctly.

He screenshotted it anyway.  
“See,” he whispered. “They’re obsessed.”

# Customer Service Confusion Disorder

Then there was the coffee shop.

Barista: “What’s your name?”  
Him, internally: *My husband.*

Barista: “Oat or almond?”  
Him: “Whatever you think suits me.”  
Barista, dead inside: “Oat.”

She drew a little smiley face on the cup because she draws smiley faces on every cup. It is not a secret code. It is not an omen. It is not a prophecy. It is literally ink.

But he stared at it like it was scripture.

He sat down and wrote a whole narrative in his head.  
She wants him.  
She’s shy.  
She’s probably been hurt before.  
He can tell.  
He is a healer.  
He is a lesson.  
He is a chapter in her life called “Finally.”

He went back the next day and ordered the same drink like it was a loyalty test.

She said, “Next.”  
He said, “It’s me.”  
She said, “Okay.”  
He said, “You remember?”  
She said, “Sure.”

She meant the drink.  
He meant destiny.

# The Group Chat Roast

His friends tried to help. Kind of.  
They weren’t saints. They were spectators.

They’d watch him spiral in real time and send each other updates.

“Bro thinks the nurse wants him because she said ‘take a deep breath.’”  
“Not the deep breath rizz.”  
“Not the medical flirtation.”  
“He’s really out here hallucinating consent.”

They weren’t even being mean on purpose. They were just… exhausted. Because it’s hard to love someone who turns basic human courtesy into foreplay in his imagination.

# The Moment of Almost Clarity

One day, he caught himself. Just for a second.

He was mid delusion, mid fantasy, mid private lecture about how “energy doesn’t lie,” when he saw the other person’s face.

Not smiling.  
Not lingering.  
Not interested.  
Just polite. Just moving through their day.

And for a microbeat, a tiny crack opened in the delusion.

Maybe they weren’t flirting.  
Maybe they were just being normal.  
Maybe he wasn’t the main character.  
Maybe the universe wasn’t sending signs.  
Maybe the universe was just… existing.

He blinked. He almost landed back on Earth.

Then his third leg cleared its throat, called an emergency meeting, and shut the whole thing down.

“Respectfully,” it said, “we are not processing feedback at this time.”

And he floated right back up into the clouds, where every glance was an invitation, every smile was a promise, and every “excuse me” was basically a love confession in disguise.

These are the fictional Delusional Bitch Chapters.

Where will this stupid man’s thirst for attention and lack of reality based cognition take him next.

Probably the grocery store.  
Where the cashier will say, “Do you want a bag?”  
And he will hear, “Do you want a future.”",3,1770344225.0,UndeadPoetSociety,3,1.0,False
1qx53gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltBeautyHub/comments/1qx53gz/finally_mastered_that_90s_alt_vibe_ive_been/,"Finally mastered that '90s alt vibe I’ve been dreaming of: a soft, smudged lip and dewy skin that doesn’t look *too* done 🦇 (My secret weapon was a sheer drugstore lipstick layered with balm).","Okay, confession time: I’ve spent way too long staring at dusty romantic portraits and thinking, ""How can I make that look less like I’m auditioning for a Victorian ghost opera and more like I just *read* a Victorian ghost opera before going to grab coffee?"" The literary gothic aesthetic is incredibly captivating, but let's be real, translating those dramatic, often somber vibes into something you can wear without getting weird looks at the grocery store is a whole different beast. My latest experiment involved trying to capture that melancholic elegance, focusing on depth and subtle drama without veering into full-on costume territory.

Here's how I tried to bring a touch of the crypt into my daily routine:

*   **The Goal:** A softened, daytime-friendly literary gothic eye with a hint of muted drama. Think less 'vampire's ball' and more 'brooding poet's library.'
*   **Key Products Used:**
    *   **Eyeshadow Palette:** *ColourPop 'That's Taupe'* palette (around $14). I primarily used the matte cool browns and greys.
    *   **Eyeliner:** *NYX Epic Ink Liner* in black ($10) – but for a tightline only.
    *   **Mascara:** *L'Oréal Voluminous Lash Paradise* in black ($11).
    *   **Brow Pencil:** *e.l.f. Instant Lift Brow Pencil* in 'Deep Brown' ($3).
*   **Application Breakdown:**
    *   **Base:** A light wash of the palest taupe matte shade from the ColourPop palette all over the lid.
    *   **Depth:** A deeper, cool-toned brown was buffed into the crease with a fluffy brush, focusing on building a soft gradient rather than a sharp line. I blended outward slightly for a 'shadowy' effect.
    *   **Subtle Smoke:** A tiny amount of the darkest grey-brown was pressed along the upper lash line with a flat brush, then softly smudged out with a clean blending brush.
    *   **Liner:** Only a very fine tightline with the *NYX Epic Ink Liner* to define the lash roots – absolutely no wing.
    *   **Mascara:** Two coats on top lashes, one light coat on bottom lashes.
    *   **Brows:** Filled in sparingly, keeping the natural shape but adding a bit more definition to frame the eye.
*   **Time Investment:** Roughly 15 minutes for the eyes.
*   **Aesthetic Nod:** Leaned into the *literary gothic* vibe through muted, cool tones and a slightly downward-sloping shadow shape for a contemplative feel, but tempered it with *functionalist* principles by keeping it soft, blended, and wearable.

Now, this wasn't an instant success, obviously. My first attempt looked less 'hauntingly beautiful' and more 'sleep-deprived raccoon.' I initially went in with too much of the darkest shade too high in the crease, which gave me more of a '90s grunge hangover' than the delicate gothic mood I was aiming for. I also tried a tiny wing initially, and it just killed the vibe, making it too sharp and less ethereal. The biggest lesson was truly *less is more* when trying to soften a dramatic aesthetic. Building up sheer layers of cool-toned browns and greys made all the difference, creating that depth without heaviness. And opting for a tightline instead of a wing preserved the delicate, slightly melancholic feel without looking 'done.' It's still a work in progress, but I’m pretty happy with this version for a regular Tuesday.

1qx52vn,https://i.redd.it/c1kel5o3ashg1.jpeg,My 20f Warbonnet UQ Arrived!,"Picked up a Gen2 XLC last year and have fallen in love with it.  Ordered the winter top-cover a while back and a custom 20f quilt w/3oz overstuff.  Woke up to this morning being colder than I expected, but even with a 25+ y/o 30f bag as my quilt, skivvies-only I was ridiculously warm.

Only issue was sticking my bare back to the ice-covered walls of my tarp while I was getting my hoodie on, but that just made the coffee tastier.

Now I AM a warm sleeper so don’t take this as advice, please.  

I am SUPREMELY happy with this quilt, the way it attaches is great and yeah, no adjustment.  I hung it, got in, zipped up and done.  No air gaps, no cold spots (I move around a bit during sleep) and no issues.  Been out most of the week in drizzling rain and wind around these temps, this was the lowest I think (or that I thought to check).

Pondering my TQ options now, I was leaning towards EE but after doing some light research in here I’m thinking Katabatic?  Haven’t even really started narrowing it down, keeping my eyes on r/geartrade too.

Am not new to camping/hiking nor winters conditions while doing so, but this is next level.  I feel like I finally ‘get it’.

Hi! I’m 22, and currently studying Biology + Industrial Engineering (focused on ecology & nutritional science). I live a structured, disciplined life, but I’m also trying to open myself to new experiences and perspectives. I’m a slim nerd, masc, Arabs–Chinese, 5'8"", and based in Indonesia.

I’m looking for a partner for long-term relationship from anywhere, I also don't mind having LDR too! as long as we get along, it’s all good. I’m into lifelong learning and real talks, so I’d love to meet people who love talking about life, ideas, and random interesting things.

For fun, I listen to pop, alternative, rock, country, orchestra, and folk. I read sci-fi, draw imaginary maps, and I’m a beginner at traveling. Biology fieldwork also gets me outdoors a lot, so I love exploring Indonesia’s nature. I’m also into culinary adventures and healthy living (not vegetarian), and lately I’ve been doing a lot of cardio. I had retinal detachment before so I can't do any activities that can make my eyes strained.

I also like memes, cats, PC games (Stardew Valley, Fall Guys, TheHunter, Terraria, Minecraft, Cities Skylines, Theotown), horror movies, and a bit of anime (Chainsaw Man, Azumanga Daioh, Demon Slayer, Haikyuu!!, Gachiakuta, Dr. Stone, Naruto, Pokémon (I wanna rewatch this), and Doraemon!). Oh, and I love drinkinh coffee + matcha at the same time!

I value mutual respect and balanced energy. I’m a bit old-fashioned about communication and boundaries, and I’m not into adult things easily. I’m also not into hookups. I’m into phone detox and productivity too! mindful tech use, deep work/focus time, and being present offline, so it’s a plus if you relate!!

I’ve also been living with a very disciplined routine. I’m an early bird and I keep my own daily schedule and to-do list. I really try to respect my time each day because I believe life is precious, so I want to use it as wisely and meaningfully as possible.

For compatibility, when it's about dating, I’m looking for an old-fashioned relationship with someone who feels more mature and dominant (or at least switch-a bit dominant) in personality than me. I’d describe myself as a switch in personality, and more of a sub / power-sub in terms of intimacy. I don’t have an age preference (18+ ofc), and I don’t mind if we have totally different interests, as long as there’s mutual understanding and respect, everything will be fine. 

Most importantly, I want someone (no matter as friends or as a partner) who can genuinely respect, understand, accept, and appreciate each other as we are. I’m the kind of person who's ISTP and likes to grow and move forward together, and I’m also big on planning and organizing, so I hope you can understand and be comfortable with that. If you’re more extroverted, I might be a little shy at first, and if you’re more introverted, that’s totally fine too! As long as we communicate and understand each other.

If you’ve read this far and think we might vibe, please don’t just say “Hi.” Tell me a bit about yourself or ask a question 🙂 ",2,1770344042.0,gayfriendship,0,1.0,False

**It's that zero idea tayo where our money actually goes every day.**

Yung ₱50 dito, ₱120 doon - akala maliit lang. Pero pag chineck mo after a month, ₱4,000 na pala yung nawala na di mo napansin.

**How to Actually Start:**

**Step 1: Track lahat for 1 month**

Hindi pa savings to. Just knowing where your money goes lang muna.

I made an expense tracker app kasi frustrated din ako sa spreadsheets dati. Ang hassle kasi magtrack.

You just type naturally - ""lunch 180, grab 95, groceries 850"" - then auto categorized na.

**Step 2: Check after weekly, bi-weekly, and monthlly**

Makikita mo kung saan talaga napupunta pera mo.

Real examples from users:

* ""Akala ko ₱2k lang food delivery ko - ₱5,800 pala monthly!""
* ""₱3,200 sa random online shopping na di ko maalala""
* ""₱1,500 sa coffee shops - 3 days sahod ko na pala to""

**Step 3: Adjust one category lang muna**

Hindi lahat. Just pick one na kaya mong bawasan.

Food delivery ₱5,800? Try mo next month ₱3,500 lang. That's ₱2,300 na na-save mo.

**Real Results:**

After tracking:

* ""First time ko naka-ipon ng ₱3k just by seeing kung saan napupunta""
* ""Di pala kailangan malaking sweldo, kailangan lang maintindihan yung flow ng pera""

Open for feedback din if may thoughts kayo or suggestions! Sharing this hoping makatulong. Free naman siya for a month to try.

Here’s what I remember about a very specific scene:

⸻

	•	A calm, quiet older woman is holding a young woman captive.

	•	The young woman is tied to a bed upstairs, with arms and legs spread and tied individually.

	•	The house is an old two-story wooden house, likely in a rural or small-town setting.

	•	A heavily built, uniformed cop shows up unexpectedly. He is wearing a tan shirt, dark pants, and carries a revolver and a P24 baton on his belt.

	•	The old woman tries to keep the girl quiet, and may even offer the cop coffee.

	•	When the cop discovers the girl, a struggle ensues: the old woman disarms him using a steel pipe or fireplace tool.

	•	She then grabs his revolver and fires. The shots are shown passing through his back, with blood appearing at each hole. After 4–5 shots, he falls, and we see the woman sitting on the floor holding the gun.

	•	The cop is not a main character; this scene is brief but very memorable.

	•	The movie is in color and feels more like a suspenseful thriller than a scary horror film.

I’ve checked obvious candidates like Mother’s Day (1980) and The Silent Scream (1979), but the scene doesn’t appear in those films.

I move my head from the car window and wipe the condensation off to get a better look at the frozen landscape outside. Passing by are tall street lights, faintly illuminating the ground beneath them. The morning sun peeking over the horizon, however, gives us the most light. Beyond the lights are walls of dark green on either side of us; we’ve only seen trees for a few miles now.

Even though I’m not the biggest fan of snow or dreary weather, I’m pretty excited for this trip. With all the responsibilities that come with work and the kids, it’ll be good for the guys and me to have some time away from society. I’d say we’re lucky to even be going. I’m not familiar with the land itself, but I’m well aware of the stories about the Hoia-Baciu Forest. It always used to creep me out as a kid, hearing about the disappearances and all—but hey, maybe it’ll add some excitement. It isn’t my choice for a fun vacation spot, but once Darius sets his mind on something, it’s hard for David and me to convince him otherwise.

We make the mistake of taking David’s car because, of course, he forgets to top off the gas before we leave. But what else can you say about him? He’s the lovable idiot of the group. We don’t have much farther to go anyway. Traffic has been slow, probably because the winter solstice is coming up and people are traveling to see their loved ones. I’m glad we brought the right gear because, even though we’re in the car, the air is getting cold. I’ve already put on my wool mittens.

“Justin, come help me with this,” Darius says as he waves me over to the trunk. David follows suit.

We brought a whole assortment of stuff—tents, food, lamps, and other typical camping items.

“Why did we have to pack so much?” David says. “We’re only spending a few nights here, and I don’t want to stay longer than I have to. It’s already giving me the creeps.”

“Just try to enjoy yourself, okay?” Darius responds.

“It’s not often we get to have a guys’ trip, so let’s make this one count,” I say, trying to look on the bright side.

It only takes a few minutes to grab our bags and equipment from the car, and we head toward the forest’s entrance.

Just a few minutes past the tree line, I notice a light fog rushing over the frozen ground. If it were nighttime, it’d be a different story, but with the morning light shining down and reflecting off the snow, it looks straight out of a fairy tale—almost mesmerizing.

“See, David? Nothing to worry about,” Darius says in an almost antagonizing way.

The forest feels alive: wind grazing the tops of the trees, birds singing to one another, and curious foxes peeking out of the brush to say hello, only to dart away shortly after, leaving paw prints in the snow. The forest feels surreal, and I’m glad we get to be a part of it.

“Let’s go off trail. Don’t you think it’ll be fun? I can see some activity just past those bushes over there. I can just imagine what we might find,” Darius says with an almost giddy attitude.

I don’t think it’s the greatest idea, but I begrudgingly go along, having to convince David to walk with us every step of the way.

The space between the trees grows smaller, and the fog thicker, making it harder to walk in a straight line or remember where we left the trail. Still, it’s nothing we haven’t dealt with on previous camping trips, even though those are few and far between. The deeper we walk, the more active the wildlife becomes. I guess the little critters aren’t expecting visitors in this part of the forest.

After walking for a while—going up small hills and jumping across creeks—we come across a clearing in the fog. Trees surround a patch of snow, almost forming a perfect circle, like the forest itself has created the ideal spot for us to set up camp.

We go around the area, picking up sticks and shoveling snow, making a few spots to pitch our tents. After a granola bar break, I get my tent up and help David with his.

A bit later, we decide to start a fire pit.

“All this wet wood is no good—did you happen to bring some dry logs with you, since you’re such an expert at this, Darius?” David asks.

“Why yes I did, fair maiden in need of rescuing!” He pulls a few dry logs from a separate bag, smiling at David.

“You know, part of me wishes you hadn’t,” David remarks under his breath.

“Don’t say stuff like that—we all have our responsibilities on the trip, and he’s doing his,” I say, trying not to cause any more dissonance in the group.

Once everything is assembled, it’s relatively easy to get a fire going, though we probably should have waited until dark. The heat radiating from the flames is warm and cozy, helping me thaw my fingers and nose. I’ve always loved the sound of fire crackling over wood—it’s comforting, and it always has been since my first camping trips with Mom and Dad.

“Here, take a look at all of these,” David says as he starts pulling wrapped items from his bag. “Snacks!”

Granola bars, trail mix, dried meat, and various fresh fruits he’s kept safe in his personal cooler.

“Wow, you really have outdone yourself, Dave,” I say.

“I know, right? The meat took me the longest to prepare, but I’d say these are my favorite,” he says as he hands out some fruit from the cooler.

They’re little berries I feel like I’ve seen somewhere before, but one thing I can say for sure is that they’re really tasty—almost like blueberries. David has already grabbed several handfuls for himself.

“Hey, slow down there, man. Don’t expect us to go rummaging for other berries in this forest. I don’t plan on taking a trip to the hospital,” I tell him.

“Yeah, you’re probably right,” he said  closing the cooler.

After finishing setting up camp, we all head to our tents. Luckily, I’m well prepared for my beauty sleep. I brought a large blanket, a sleeping bag, a big fluffy pillow, and—last but not least—my trusty personal heater.

“It’s starting to get dark,” I mutter under my breath, rubbing my hands together in front of the heater to stay warm. I can already see my breath clearly. The shadows of the trees have grown long, casting themselves over the snow. I’m pretty tired from all the walking and ready for bed.

**Part 2: Strange Happenings**

A few hours pass, and I still haven’t fallen asleep. I know it’s a bad habit I need to break, but I can’t help it when my mind starts to race. Still, that isn’t what keeps me up—I feel uneasy.

The wind howls through the trees, loud enough that I can’t hear anything else. It’s strange, though. The wind sounds different here, more… vocal. Normally I wouldn’t think much of it, but I’m not familiar with this land, and I keep wondering what kind of animals might be out there in the dark—ones I can’t hear—waiting for me to shut my eyes.

Just thinking about it puts me in a cold sweat, and makes my hands start to shake badly. I need to sleep. Maybe the wind will die down soon.

In the morning, after a few hours of not-so-pleasant sleep, the wind has stopped, but it has caused snow to pile up around our tents, making it difficult to step out without snow falling in. Fog has also settled into the clearing—I must not have noticed it come in during the night.

I’m the first one up. I haven’t been able to sleep much anyway. So much for the first night going well.

“Morning, sunshine,” I hear a voice from my right. It’s Darius, stepping out of his tent.

“Were you able to get some rest?” I ask as I start getting the fire going again.

“I did—slept like a baby,” he let out an annoyingly audible yawn while stretching.

“So… the wind didn’t keep you up last night?”

“What do you mean?”

“The wind that piled the snow up around our tents,” I say.

“No, I don’t remember hearing any wind. Actually, it was a pretty quiet night, if I remember right.”

That can’t be right. It was so loud.

“Huh… that’s strange. But what about the sno—”

“Here, let me help you with that,” he says, interrupting me as he steps over to stoke the fire. He must have had a hard sleep, I think to myself.

A little while later, after David wakes up, we decide to push deeper into the heart of the forest. The sky is cloudy, and the fog hangs thick in the air, casting a gray, dreary haze over everything.

“This fog is making everything wet and cold,” David remarks. “Dang it—that’s what I forgot to bring. A nice pot of hot coffee to warm us up,” he adds, finishing the thought out loud.

We keep moving forward, trying to stay close together, and after a bit we stop.

“I’ve got an idea,” Darius says. He walks up to a tall tree, pulls out a knife, and etches a triangle into the bark.

“Hey, that’s a smart one,” I say. He grins, proud of himself—like a kid admiring their own Play-Doh masterpiece.

After that, every fifty feet or so, we carve a triangle into the biggest tree we can find to help guide us back—a breadcrumb trail through the forest, like Hansel and Gretel—though I don’t plan on finding a witch out here.

We’ve traveled a good distance from our site and found a small creek to follow, with rocks of all sizes and shades of gray. Every now and then, I find an interesting one to add to my collection. I find a really cool green one along the water. This fog, on the other hand, troubles me—I can’t see more than a few feet ahead of us. The fog feels different here; one moment we have a clear line of sight, the next it’s impossible to see our feet. But we’re still together, and that’s what matters.

“Maybe we should start marking trees closer together,” I tell Darius up ahead, looking down at the creek.

“Yeah, you’re probably right.” He walks over and etches a triangle into the nearest tree. He lifts his head to look around, trying to find the last one he marked, then turns to me with a worried look.

“Justin, where’s David?”

Confused, I turn around. “What do you mean? He’s just right here behind—”

Gone. Nowhere to be seen.

My heart starts to beat heavy in my chest. “I just heard him walking a few seconds ago. Where could he have gone?” I say.

“David—”

We start yelling. “DAVID! David, buddy, where are you?!”

Nothing. No response. Not even a faint noise.

“Maybe he headed back to camp?” I say nervously.

“Yeah… yeah, he probably did. Let’s go back.”

The walk back is unpleasant so far. Every now and then we call out for him, only for the trees to echo our voices back at us. I can tell the temperature has dropped; my lungs are starting to hurt.

“Hey, Darius,” I say. “Have you noticed anything strange since David disappeared?”

“What do you mean?” he responds.

“Look around—the animals. I haven’t seen or heard any of them for a while now.”

Darius looks around, then pauses, noticing that what I say is true. “Huh… yeah. I haven’t either. Strange.”

“Maybe all of our yelling scared them away?” I ask, trying to find an explanation.

“That’s probably it. I just wish they’d come back, though,” he says. “I could use the company.”

We continue calling out, and again, nothing. The markings on the trees have been helpful, because of them we are starting to recognize the surrounding area.

“We need to pick up our pace if we want to get that fire going. Maybe David will see it and find his way back,” I say, and we quicken our steps. The ground has frozen over and crunches under our feet with every step.

“Do you smell that?” Darius asks as he turns to me.

“Yeah, I do. Must be a dead animal,” I say.

Darius’ face turns worried. “You don’t think—”

“No, it’s not him,” I say, trying to calm him down. “Try not to think about that. He’s fine and he’ll make his way back, I promise you.”

That seems to comfort him. We continue our walk with Darius leading. The light is starting to wane, and the shadows of the forest are growing longer.

Crunch. Crunch. Crunch. Squish.

Darius jumps back. “Gross! What was that?” He gasps and looks down to examine his shoe.

My eyes turn to the ground, just barely lit by the dimming sky, to see what it is.

“It… it looks like a rabbit, but—what happened to it? The poor thing’s all twisted up.”

Its body is like that of a wrung-out towel and it has a gaping hole in one side that exits the other. But, most gruesomely of all, it’s half rotted.

“It must’ve been here for ages to be looking like that,” I say.

“But what caused the hole? A… predator maybe?” asks Darius, trying to make sense of it all.

“I’m not sure, but… that has to be it. Yeah, just a predator. Let’s keep moving, I can hardly see my hands anymore.”

I lift my head back up to continue walking but before I take a step—plop.

Something hits my shoulder with a loud thud.

“Ouch!” I wince as a grab my shoulder. “What was—”

I look down once more. A fox, or at least what looks like one. Twisted and bloody, with the same gaping hole.

“Where did it come from?” Darius says, looking at me with a confused look.

Both of our eyes look up into the tops of the trees.

“What in the—”

Birds, bunnies, frogs, foxes, and every other animal local to the land are skewered onto the branches of the tree, twisting and intertwining with itself through the rotting meat. Almost as if the tree itself grew through them.

My stomach drops, and my heart starts to drum in my ears.

“Darius—” I say as I look over to him. “We need to get out of this forest.”

His gaze doesn’t falter from the blood-covered limbs, and he is unable to move, like the forest floor has taken hold of his legs and does not wish to let go.

“Darius,” I whisper. “DARIUS!”

He snaps out of the trance. “Wa— a… yeah, yeah, let’s go.”

We start running through the brush, stumbling as we go and scraping the sides of our legs and arms. We are just barely able to see the triangles on the trees, but then I start to notice something horrifying.

“They’re everywhere…” I say under my voice.

Every other tree, another horrible sight. More animals, more blood, more rot. I start to get sick to my stomach, trying not to gag at the smell. My feet are starting to get weak from the running.

“Not much farther,” I say while panting. “I can just about see the clearing!” I yell back to Darius, who has a grim look on his face.

Crunch, crunch, squish, crunch, squish, crunch, crunch. We keep stepping on them. They are all falling off the branches, as if trying to hit us.

Before we know it, we make it back to camp and are trying to catch our breath. I vomit in the nearest bush.

After a moment of silence, Darius and I get the fire started again, this time with more wood, in hopes David will find his way back.

“He can’t be safe out there, with… with whatever is doing all of THAT out there, dude!” Darius says with a shaky voice.

“I know, I know,” I respond, trying to make sense of it all. “I know we can’t leave him here…”

My eyes meet Darius’. We both silently nod in agreement, already knowing what to do.

We keep calling his name. Over and over, we call to him, but there’s no response—nothing at all. I’m beginning to lose hope; maybe I’m just a bad friend.

Darius and I finally decide to sleep after calling for David all night long. I’m losing my voice, and my throat hurts whenever I speak, but I won’t stop looking for him. I can’t. He’s out there somewhere, all alone.

We make our way to the tents, barely able to keep our heads up—either from exhaustion or desperation. Maybe both.

Another restless night. Of course it is. Why wouldn’t it be with David missing?

“Why is this happening…?” I ask myself as I pull my sleeping bag over me. “We shouldn’t have come here. I knew it was a stupid idea. Those stories…” I shudder.

“No—don’t think about it. Sleep. That’s what I need right now.”

I close my eyes and wait to fade into sleep, with nothing but the stillness in the air to soothe me.

“Justin…”

My heart skips a beat.

“Justin… please.”

It’s faint and hoarse, calling from the dark.

I jump out of my tent, my gaze frantically darting toward the tree line. I don’t see anything at all—but he’s calling to me. I hear his voice as clear as day. My eyes jump back and forth, from one shadow to another, searching for anything that resembles him.

“Please… help me”

It’s distant, but not too far—maybe a few hundred yards away. Worse than that, he sounds like he’s in pain.

“Please…”, The voice says again.

I rush over to Darius’ tent and try to wake him. “Come on, why won’t you get up? I hear him, I hear David!” I say, pushing him, with an almost exited tone. But, he’s dead asleep.

“To heck with it,” I mutter, frustrated.

I can’t believe what I’m about to do, but I’m going out to find him alone—even though it’s incredibly stupid. I can’t just sit here while he’s screaming my name.

I pack some supplies into my backpack: some food, a knife, and my heater to keep me warm on the way there—and David warm on the way back. I can hardly see anything at this hour, and snow is starting to fall. Even though it’s just a heater, I hold it out in front of me, its weak glow pushing back the frozen dark, even with it’s irregular flickering.

The snow on the ground has gotten thicker around the camp, making it hard to walk without kicking it up into the air, but nevertheless, I push through.

“David!” I call out to him.

“Where can he be? This… this doesn’t make any sense,” I mutter to myself.

The crunching under my feet is loud, but my yelling is louder.

“David!” I yell again.

No response.

My pace quickens. “David! Where are you?!”

“Justin… over here.”

My breath escapes me. Not far. Not far at all—just a few paces in front of me.

I break into a sprint, or at least try to, before falling into the snow and scrambling back up again.

“HELP ME!” the voice yells with a newfound strength.

It echoes through the forest, louder than I could ever be.

I stop running. I pause.

My mind starts to race.

“How is he able to scream like that…?”

But that isn’t what’s horrifying.

The scream came from behind me.

I freeze in place, not wanting to move an inch. The hair on the back of my neck stiffens as I imagine what’s behind me. But I dare not turn around. I know it’s not him.

“JUSTIN!” the voice bellows loudly, causing me to stumble to the ground.

“Why…?” I ask, my voice shaking. “What are you…?”

No response. All I can hear is the beating of my heart.

I prop myself up on one knee, and that thing shifts its weight in response. Then, a pause—a moment of stillness.

“Just… JUST GET AWAY FROM ME!” I yell as I stand up and break into a sprint.

It’s fast—faster than me, I can tell—and its hulking legs thud against the ground as it chases after me.

“Keep going, keep going,” I tell myself over and over again.

“PLEASE!” it calls from behind, its voice forcing the trees themselves to sway as it speaks.

“No… not like this, please,” I beg.

It doesn’t listen. It quickens its pace—budadoom, budadoom, budadoom—like a horse of monstrous size, ripping through the snow-covered ground.

My legs are starting to give out. I can’t keep this up much longer, but—

“Justin…”

I hear it in front of me. This time it’s weaker. This time it’s human.

David. The real David. Pleading for me once again.

But before I can fully realize it—

crack.

I run headfirst into the base of a tree, a chunk of bark forcing itself into my forehead.

**Part 3: Horrible Masterwork**

The next thing I know, there’s ringing—and a bright flash. Was I knocked unconscious? I don’t know. But I can tell something’s different. What is it? I ask myself, and then I realize—the thudding has stopped. It finally stopped.

I try to open my blood-dripping eyes and see… absolutely nothing. Just darkness. Dazed, I scan the area for whatever that thing is, lurking somewhere in the dark.

“Where did it…,” I mumble as I try to stand on aching legs. But I notice something else too—there are no tracks in the snow.

I reach up and touch my forehead. “Ow,” I wince at the cut. It’s deep, but thankfully not too deep.

“I hate this forest. I hate that thing. And I hate this stupid fog. I hate it all,” I say to myself. I don’t know if I can take this anymore. No—I can’t. And I don’t want to.

I can’t find David, I don’t want to anymore, I want to leave. “What am I thinking?”, I say to myself. “What kind of a friend am I?”.

I start to walk but I stumble. I need to find my way back to camp and I need to wake Darius. We have to leave this awful place.

What is this forest?

Why does it hate me?

I’m able to walk—slowly but surely—and the blood dripping from my head stains the snow behind me.

“I can’t see anything,” I say to myself, peering through the dark. Then I realize I had my heater, but—where did it go? I must have dropped it when that thing was chasing me.

“Whatever,” I mutter. It’s the least of my worries now.

I keep moving. One step. Two steps. I fall. Three steps.

“I’m going to make it out of here,” I tell myself, trying to be brave.

But what’s brave about abandoning your friend?

I take a few more steps and then—

“Eugh… what’s that smell?” I pinch my nose.

I look around, but I don’t see anything.

Then I make the mistake of looking up.

“David… no.”

His shoulders and legs are bent behind him, wrapped around the tree, like he was violently forced up there. His shoulders and hips protrude unnaturally from his skin. And just like the animals, roots are growing through him.

And worst of all—the rot.

“Wha… I… I’m so sorry, David,” I whimper, staring at him, not even having the energy to cry.

I can’t be here anymore.

I’m going back to camp.

I’m going back to the car.

I’m going back home.

I never wanted this.

I never did.

Never.

I take a step back, looking at his lifeless body once more, then turn and head back toward camp.

I don’t have the energy to run. One foot in front of the other—that’s all I can think about right now. All I want to do.

I see the camp way off in the distance. The fire is still going. “Did Darius finally wake up?” I ask myself, barley being able to stay awake. “After everything that happened, why does he do it now? I’m going to… to tell him everything. He—he deserves to kno—“

Thud.

I pass out before I can reach the campsite, face-first into the snow. I’m finally able to get some rest.

**Part 4: The Witness**

I wake up warm, morning sunlight peeking through the treetops above. Darius is sitting by the fire, watching the flames dance across the logs. When he notices me stir, he smiles.

“Hey, buddy. How’d you sleep? You’re lucky I found you when I did—you were just about frozen solid,” he says with a hearty laugh.

“Huh? What happ—ahh,” I wince, grabbing my forehead. There’s a cloth wrapped around it.

“That’s a pretty nasty cut you’ve got there. I did some work on it, though—shouldn’t get infected.”

I yawn and try to sit up. “What time is it?” I ask, nearly shielding my eyes from the light.

“About ten in the morning. You’re a hard sleeper, you know.”

Then it hits me.

“David!” I yell. “I—I found him in the forest. H-he—” I can’t finish through the tears.

“Hey, calm down,” he says. “What are you talking about?”

“Why didn’t you wake up last night?!” I sob. “I tried and tried, but you wouldn’t move!”

“Justin…” Darius pauses.

“Who’s David?”

“What?”, I say as my stomach drops. “How… Darius what do mean?”

“Well, you were mumbling that name during your sleep, who is this David you keep mentioning?”

“Stop playing, I mean it. I went out last night and I found him Darius, he’s dead, dead do you hear me!?” I yell pushing him away from me.

He stumbles back, confused, but then walks forward again, closer.

“Justin, we’re the only ones here. There’s no David.”

Why is he saying these awful things? How could he joke about something this serious? He can’t—

“What?” I say to myself, looking around.

There are only two tents.

“You hit your head bad, okay? You’re just imagining things. Here, take this,” he says as he hands me a cup. “It’s coffee. It’ll make you feel better.”

I take a sip. It’s good. Very good.

“But I thought David didn’t—”

Darius looks at me with a blank expression.

“I… never mind,” I say.

I finish my coffee, relishing every last drop, while Darius paces back and forth between the tents.

“Justin,” he says, looking at me. “Let’s take a walk. It’s a beautiful day, and there’s something I want to show you.”

Confused, I agree and start walking with him.

The forest feels… alright, actually. The sun is out, and it’s a bit warmer today. Darius seems unusually happy—but he doesn’t remember. He doesn’t remember him. He doesn’t remember David. Why? Why is he choosing to joke about this? Of all things, at all moments, now?

Has he lost his mind?

How could he?

David is gone, and I know we will be too if we don’t leave this dreaded place. But what feels different? Did something change here while I was gone?

There are still only two tents.

“You’ve been busy, huh?” I ask Darius as I notice the triangle markings on the trees. There are more of them now. A whole lot more.

“Oh yeah. I got bored while you were out of it, so…” he says with a small giggle, “…I decided to spend my time with those.”

We keep walking in silence for a bit. I kind of prefer it that way—I need to clear my thoughts.

“It’s just such a beautiful shape, isn’t it?” Darius asks suddenly.

Confused, I hesitate before answering.

“What are you talking about?” I ask.

“The markings on the trees. The triangle. Her shape.”

I don’t know what to say. Or what to think about that statement.

Her shape?

I’m too tired for this.

“Darius, who’s sha—”

“Good news!” he cuts me off. “We’re almost there.” He points ahead.

We come up to a clearing.

It’s strange—the trees are bunched tightly in the center, and then there’s nothing for at least fifty feet around them. These trees are different. Thicker. Taller. Older. Their bark is dark as chocolate and rough. They cast perfect shade, like their own canopy.

A sense of peace has come over me, I like it here.

But one thing is confusing.

Why are their leaves red?

“Come. We need to get closer. You’ll see—you’ll see her.”

Before I know it, he breaks into a run, straight for the looming bundle of trees.

“Darius, wait—” I try to get him to stay, to give me an explanation for all of this, but it’s to no avail. Once he steps between the trees, he vanishes into their shade.

Everything is quiet now. Everything except for a slight breeze.

I can’t see what’s past the trees. I’m too far away—but I don’t know if I want to find out. My eyes jump up to the leaves, but I can’t make out any clear image. All I know is that they’re a deep red, unlike any of the other trees surrounding them.

In my anxiousness, I start to pace back and forth. Waiting for him. Waiting for an answer.

“What’s taking him so long?” I ask myself.

Before long, I see him—off in the distance—walking out from those trees.

“So… what is it?” I yell to him, my hand covering my eyes from the sun.

“Come here…” I hear him say, and I take a few steps forward.

“Come to me…”

Something is off. I stop walking.

His image becomes clearer now. His face is… grim.

“Darius, what’s going on?” I ask as I see tears rolling down his face.

Then I realize—his mouth isn’t moving.

“COME,” says a deep, bellowing voice.

From its mighty wind, Darius is forced back against a tree, his limbs twisting, roots burrowing into him.

“No…” I whisper, my head spinning, my heart beating out of my chest.

“NO!” I scream in defiance toward whatever monstrosity is in there.

Without delay, I sprint away from those horrible trees—but before I can get far—

“OBEY.”

I fall to the ground, the breath ripped from my lungs.

“W-what is ha—happening to me…?” I strain to say as I collapse, forcing myself back up.

One step. Two steps.

Keep going.

“BOW,” it demands—this time with such violent force that the trees splinter at their bases, swaying back and forth as if worshiping it.

With no thought other than escape, I drag myself across the ground, trying to get as far away as possible.

“I’m almost there…” I tell myself as I near the outermost line of trees. If I can just get past them, I’ll be safe—even though I know that’s a lie.

“Come on!” I cry out, forcing myself back onto my feet to finally leave this Godforsaken forest until—

“Please.”

A whimper. A cry for help. Such a pitiful thing it was to hear.

I stop.

“Please… come to me,” it softly whispers, the gentle voice gracefully touching the back of my neck.

“I… need to get out of here”—but I don’t. Why leave?

“I want to stay,” I tell myself. “Maybe this is all a dream. Maybe she can wake me”, I mutter under my breath.

“Yes… I need to go back, She’s calling for me. She needs me. I… I need Her”

I need your advice,"(26M) recently single 4months (2nd GF). ended up bumping into my first GF (26F) over Christmas. Last time I dated this girl was back 8 years ago, our relationship lasted from 16-19. She broke up with me at the time as we were both under a lot of pressure with deciding on what university’s to go to etc. & we weren’t getting on the best and so we went on a break at that time. During the break she ended up getting with a guy I was friendly with. At the time I was very upset but I hindsight it should have mattered as we were basically broken up.

Anyways, years later, I meet this girl on a night out in my local area, she’s recently become single too. She was fairly drunk but said to me that she would like to talk & catch up. Weeks later we ended up going for a coffee date in which she ended up staying at my house for 2 days. (We slept together etc).

All my old emotions came up after I spent time with her. We’re both still very attracted to eachother, however my guard is still up even though it’s been years ago since I was in a relationship with her.

I am conscious that if this was to ever blossom into a relationship again down the line, I don’t know if I would be comfortable that she is still friends with the same guy she got with after our relationship. They are kind of in a shared friend group so I get that there’s sometimes no avoiding that. In 6 months, She is also moving to another country over to her sister and a few of her friends, that same guy moved over recently to the same friends so I know that they will be around eachother over there.

She did say to me that if things were to become serious between us that her friends would be afraid she wouldn’t move abroad.

\\\*\\\*Am I being insecure about the guy friend from years ago or does it make any sense to be skeptical about a relationship with this girl again?\\\*\\\*",1,1770343786.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

What happened was in my early morning exhaustion, I grabbed the wrong pod (wanted espresso and put a coffee pod in by mistake… still not sure how 🧟‍♀️)… there was enough water for the pod I intended but not for a coffee one… annnnnd I managed to run the machine dry. 

Video attached was an attempt to run a cleaning cycle… this was early on in my life saving attempts… sadly, I was unable to resuscitate.. 

Ive tried the following: 

\- popping the water tank off and on til pigs flew

\- blowing air (straw and air compressor) when it sounds like its attempting to take in water

\- warmer water in water tank

\- propping the machine 

I’ve watched YouTube, scour ed Reddit, spoke with Nespresso support and was offered a small discount an as this machine is discontinued (unable to find in 🇨🇦) id really really love to fix it …

Soo Reddit… any random fixes that have worked for you??? 

Praying for a miracle as this is my emotional support machine… 

Thanks in advance — and pls be kind.. the internet is worse than a children’s sand box.
