1o9wsk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Wondersoul420/comments/1o9wsk6/untitled/,Untitled,"My life is boring, I’m a boring person, but hey, I’m doing alright. I was never the type to stand out, I was always quiet as a kid, but that’s all I can remember, I can see bits and pieces of my life back then but everything looks blurred out and distorted. I have no one to ask, my mom passed away when I was a kid, my dad was never around, they didn’t have family, except one random person, she was related to my mom somehow, I can’t even remember that being explained to me, I don’t even remember her telling any stories about my mom. Anyhow, I’m old enough to take care of myself, I have 3 jobs, almost have enough saved to quit one job, although time lately has been feeling off, I can’t remember how long I’ve been at each job, or how I started them. Since I’m alone, I keep myself busy, I live alone with my 2 cats, and I don’t have friends, it’s fine though. I’ve been smoking weed for years, it’s helps me more than any medication I’ve tried for whatever is wrong with me, I don’t feel so off when I’m high, time still feels weird though, when I get a chance to just be at home, I like to paint, I’ll roll a joint, make some coffee, play my favorite podcast and just paint for hours, somedays I’ll look up and see the sun rising, as if I stayed up all night, but how, weed as never effected me like that before. As the days go by, my memory becomes more faded, “What did I do yesterday”?, I can’t remember. I go about my day, like I’m on autopilot, my bed calls to me, it feels cold at first but warms up quickly as I drift off to sleep. I’ve been having the same dream, a few details are different but I see and hear the same people, a young woman and a young man, and then there’s an older man, but he looks more blurry, he is always touching me and checking for things, it’s uncomfortable but I can’t move away. My eyes open and I see the sun has risen, time for a new day. It drags on, and yet flys by, it’s already night time? I decide to go see a doctor, as I explain what has been happening, he simply smiles and says, “I’m sure you are just fine, let’s run some tests though”. They take blood and scan my brain, everything is normal, I’m healthy and I’ve lost weight, but wait, when did I lose weight. Days after the doctor, I notice the changes, how can he say I’m healthy, my collarbones are showing more, my ribs are poking out, my eyes look sunken in and I have bags under my eyes, I look, almost dead. Sleep calls me, and in my dream I hear my name being called, I move towards the sound and again I see the young man, he is alone though, and sad, he says to me” You have always been a fighter mom, keep fighting, the doctor said you are getting better”. That must have been my subconscious because I just had a doctors appointment and he said I was fine, I thought it was odd for someone to call me mom, I’ve never had a relationship long enough to have a baby, I don’t remember him but at the same time, he feels familiar. I felt stuck though, lost, like I couldn’t remember what I was doing. I don’t remember leaving my house, I can’t even remember working now, I don’t even know what day it is. My house looks odd, the clocks all read something different, some have weird lines, some have numbers but they aren’t clock numbers, they go up and down, my bed calls me. I slip into sleep, I see a light appearing then disappearing, and a faint beeping sound, I see that doctor again, poking at me, mumbling something, the young man comes closer, he looks, worried, the young woman then appears, she whispers something then they walk away. I open my eyes and the sun has risen. Why do I feel so weird, why is time so off? I’m so tired, I’ve been sitting in the same spot, but for how long, I’m not sure, soon the sun sets, I’m feel exhausted, my bed calls me. As I slip into sleep, I see the light again, I hear the beeping, I whisper, “What is that”?, a gasp and then, “Mom”? My eyes flutter open, I squint, everything is blurry, and the room is bright, the beeping is loud now, I look over and I see what’s been on my clocks, the lines and the numbers, an object is placed in my face, now I can see. The young man smiles and says, “There you go mom, can you see better now”? He is crying, the young women walks in, she throws down whatever she was holding and comes over, also crying. I look over and the doctor is looking at me, curiosity in his face. ",1,1760796504.0,u_Wondersoul420,0,1.0,False

1o9wq7x,https://i.redd.it/cochqx3knvvf1.jpeg,From using shared auto to taking my first biz class flight,"Previous post got removed due to less effort, hence posting a detailed post


Just had a milestone moment and thought I'd share my journey here since this community has been a motivator for me.

I’m a 32M and recently crossed ₹3.21 Crore net worth, all while working in tech and product roles over the past decade. Here’s a breakdown of where things stand based on my current asset allocation:

- US Stocks: ₹18.21K
- Vehicle: ₹16.69L
- EPF: ₹16.57L
- Mutual Funds: ₹26.11L
- Other Brokers (Stocks/Equity): ₹34.95L
- PPF: ₹13.93L
-ESOP: ₹ 56L

Started out with humble beginnings, jumped through the usual hoops of tech jobs, stayed consistent with savings/investing, and kept learning about personal finance along the way.

A lot of this came down to:
- Being disciplined with SIPs in mutual funds
- Conservatively building my EPF/PPF corpus
- Always keeping one eye on stock opportunities 
- Not letting lifestyle creep eat away at the portfolio (even though coffee and travel are guilty pleasures!) Have been to 13 countries till now

Not here to brag, just celebrating a win and hoping this motivates some lurkers to track their own journeys diligently. If anyone’s on a similar path or needs a nudge to start, happy to connect.

Here’s to bigger goals, smarter investments, and a balanced life!

She came closer and went for a side hug type thing, she gave me the hug and placed her hand on my waist. I didn't know what to do and so instead of standing awkwardly while she was hugging me, I also placed my hand on her waist very lightly, almost like a tap but I am sure she felt my hand too. I did not want to touch her in an inappropriate way but this happened. She did not seem to startle and the thing ended. Then I went in the kitchen roamed around and came out. Her mother asked me if I wanted some snacks or coffee like she does normally...She also insisted that I eat something there..I said I already ate and then me and my friend exited to go out.

for context: i know how to make adetailers, controlnets, loras, and of course images. i work comfertably with all generators, both realistic and not. if it pays enough(unlikely but possible, im a doctor getting into pg rn), i can make like 3 loras a day no problem. i will be using wither civitai or a cloud gpu(sadly my 2 good computers broke, one pc got coffee spilled on it and the laptop could only handle so much ark and stable diffusion), so i dont have a concern for computing capacity.

1o9wlz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/1o9wlz1/netbenefits_should_be_closed_down_by_the_feds/,Netbenefits should be closed down by the Feds,"My employer's retirement program is with Fidelity.  My prior employers used better alternatives.  Each day, by 4:10pm, Vanguard shows my net asset value for the day that just closed at 4pm.  Others take longer, some not until 7pm at night.  But by that time, I am able to see a true picture of my consolidated financial condition via an account aggregator like Fidelity's Full View, or Schwab, or Chase, etc.

Problem is, Fidelity.  Fidelity doesn't show the 4pm close value until the middle of the night--literally around or after midnight.  Worse, even after Fidelity begrudgingly confesses the latest value on its Web site or app, for many hours longer than that, usually until around 9am the next morning, Fidelity continues to populate account aggregators with the stale data from two market days ago.  While it could be that a multibillion dollar company in the financial services sector is just that incompetent, it would seem unlikely.  Rather, there is a malice and an antipathy toward retirement plan participants at Fidelity.  After all, we didn't choose to do business with Fidelity.  Our HR benefits people made the selection.  So Fidelity will shower those folks with coffee mugs and team presentations and thick handouts that seem meaty.  The employees can drop dead.  Fidelity isn't going to lift a finger to treat them with the care they are entitled to with their money in Fidelity custody.

That's why, as I write this message at almost 10am ET on a Saturday morning, Fidelity is still sending Thursday's closing market values to account aggregators.  All of the other financial data is up to date, but the Fidelity component is a day late and too many dollars short.  I don't know where the financial regulators are who are asleep at the switch and permitting Fidelity's transgressions against the public interest, but as someone who personally, through force of personality, brought a Forbes 500 company's 401(k) plan from another platform to Fidelity's, I could not be more sorry that I did it and I promise to be more attentive to employees' reasonable expectations in the future.  Fidelity had best hope I don't get the opportunity to redesign my present employer's plan as I did for the last one--but my co-workers should pray that I do.  Retirement plans and Fidelity don't mix for successful organizations looking to make every benefit a smooth, high quality, talent retention competitive advantage.

PS Launching the netbenefits app always results in an error message that the app is temporarily unavailable.  For years on end now.  If you work in benefits, word to the wise:  avoid Fidelity like the plague.  Because it is plague.",0,1760796066.0,fidelityinvestments,2,0.07,False

My partner is a busy man, he works a lot and works every weekend. I am a 9-5er punctuated with unpredictable overtime that ruins the week, my weekends are my only true time off. 

I desperately have wanted to just have those simple couple experiences, something like going for a walk together, going to a coffee shop, is not an option due to his working hours. I am fortunate to have a solid friend group that I utilize to fill my weekends and evenings, but it’s not the same and I’m often the 3rd wheel. I have communicated on numerous occasions that I’m envious of other couples because of their ability to just have simple moments.  

I have brought up my wishes for weekend activities, I’ve come up with solutions (get up early and grab brunch, coffee or something before he leaves), and it gets agreed to but of course on the days of, nothing changes. He’s busy, but this void needs to be filled. I want someone to go for these walks, coffee shops, share the simple pleasures of life with. 

I felt like during the beginning there was a conscious effort to make the mornings matter but not anymore. I absolutely loathe not having the same days off and I feel a huge emotional disconnect. I am lonely.

How do you go about making time where there is none? How do you fill that void without seeking out others? (I don’t want to end up towing any lines!!) or, How do you get over something your soul yearns for? I am at a loss and genuinely feel I’ve exhausted my own ideas and my friends.

1o9wifk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o9wifk/harvest_in_hikatoba/,Harvest in Hikatoba,"My name is Tamantha ‘Trouble’ Turrell, if you're reading this, then Hikatoba, Idaho is gone.



It all started on September 21st. I woke up and went to my little dead-end job at Marinette's coffee house. A small mom-and-pop style coffee shop. Since our podunk town was too small for a Starbucks, this was the best we could do. I unlocked the employee entrance, got the machines up and running, and started making Mr. Sampson's order. Once the coffee was percolating, I unlocked the front door and flipped the sign. The same as always, nothing ever changes in Hikatoba.



At exactly 6:45 A.M., Mr. Sampson walked through the front door, like always. He was a large man; he towered over my staggering 5’5” like some biblical giant. He kind of looked like someone gave a gorilla a terrible haircut, all muscle and hair. His pug-like face scrunched up in what could be generously described as a smile, with his prominent canines on full display. “Good morning, Mr. Sampson, having a good day?” I asked in my best customer service voice, a fake smile on my face.



“Morning, Miss Turrell. I'm having a wonderful day! Excited for the festival tonight?” His voice boomed out, shaking me from my routine momentarily. He was normally a very reserved man.



“Festival? I haven't heard anything about it.” I had lived here my entire life, and we had never had a festival around this time.



“Ah, it’s the full moon harvest festival. Mayor Prescott decided to revive it this year. We haven't done it since I was a pup.” He gave a hearty chuckle after he spoke. “It’ll be in the town square tomorrow night, make sure to show up, lass. It’ll be a celebration of a lifetime.” He paid and left shortly after.



Overly exuberant potato farmers aside, the rest of my shift passed like normal. With me doom-scrolling on my phone most of my shift, unfortunately interrupted on occasion to do my job. At 8:30 P.M., I wrapped up my shift by vaulting the day's meager earnings and cleaning the machines. It was 9 P.M. when I locked up the door and started on my way back home. The moon was out softly illuminating the two-lane road that ran through the center of town. Scattered street lamps lit up parts of the street better, but the majority of them were broken from generations of bored teenagers. Our small village couldn't even afford to replace them until next year.



I was about halfway back to my duplex when I felt the hair on the back of my neck rise. It felt like someone or something was watching me. Glancing around, the only thing I saw was the mist from my breath in the chilly autumn air. As I passed by an alleyway, I heard a trash can get knocked over and a loud gravelly hiss. The sound nearly made me jump out of my skin, and I spun around, quickly getting into what could liberally be called a boxer's stance. A large tomcat came streaking out of the alley and ran across the street. The relief I felt nearly sent me to my knees until I heard a howl.



We don't have a ton of wolves in Idaho, but we do have a decent population. Not enough to be hearing them in town, however. Later I figured it was probably someone’s hound dog or a coyote howling out. That fact didn't stop me from immediately racing back to my crappy little duplex, nearly dropping my keys as I hurriedly tried to unlock my door. When I finally got inside, I all but slammed the door shut, locking it before collapsing onto my rear right in front of it, sighing in relief at being safe in my home. The feeling of being watched was finally gone.



After a little while of calming myself down, I set about my nightly routine, turning on some music, showering, and reheating leftovers from 3 days ago. My half of the house was on the ground floor, and thankfully my upstairs neighbor was a truck driver who wouldn't be home for three more days, so I wouldn't have to listen to his booming footsteps all night. Turning off my music and flipping on the SYFY channel, I passed out on my hand-me-down couch to the dulcet tones of some B-rate horror flick about the Beast from the mountains or something equally cheesy.



Around midnight, I got woken up by some dumb werewolf movie. The howling and various other noises like scratching, sniffing, and growling must have gotten my sleep-addled brain to throw up some terrible dream thinking there was something at my own door, or at least that's what I thought at the time.



When morning arrived, I set about the herculean task of waking up. I was halted in my epic quest by my phone ringing. It was my boss, Mrs. Harriet. She was a sweet old lady whose husband had passed away a few years ago. “Hello, Tammy dear, I just wanted to let you know you won't be needed at the shop today. I'm closing down for the festival, so go have fun and maybe meet a boy tonight. Like that Carson's boy, you know he's carried a torch for you since you both were in diapers.” She also elected herself my personal matchmaker.



“I’ll be at that festival, Mrs. Harriet, and no, I will not be going with Scott Carson.” The jerk stole my cookies in elementary school and I will never forgive him. Her grandmotherly chuckle told me that she was by no means deterred.



“We’ll see, dearie. Ah, I can't wait for you young’uns to see your first harvest. It was always such a treat as a child; the sky would light up like the Fourth back in the day.” Her wistful tone was almost reverent as if she was remembering an almost religious experience. “Well, I’ll let you go now, sweetie. Come say hello before the big finale, and if you bring a boy I'll buy you both a treat.” She bribed, making me roll my eyes.



We said our goodbyes and I promptly flopped back onto the couch, excited to relax for a little while longer than normal. By the time I actually got up and ready, it was noon. When I stepped outside, I could already hear the hustle and bustle of the locals setting up in the center of town about three blocks away. When I went to lock my door, I noticed it. The upper half of the windowless metal door was covered in claw marks: shallow furrows, widely spaced on its surface far too high for any hound or coyote.



A cold sense of dread filled me from the cruel revelation. I fled towards the center of town, not quite jogging but definitely fast walking. I hoped that being around others would keep me safe and calm me down. Even the scent of vinegar-covered French fries, finger steaks, and ice cream potatoes couldn't keep my mind off of the fear lancing through me. The festival was little more than a glorified street fair early in the day with small groups of teens and young adults milling about buying food and various knickknacks from street vendors, while the village elders set up street games and stalls. I meandered about, finding myself drawn to the large stage being set up at the center of the small park that was the town square.



I could recognize everyone setting up the stage with sound equipment and small braziers. It was mostly the male teachers from the local public school, but one face stood out, Mayor Prescott. Once I got to the foot of the stage, he greeted me with a warm smile. “Ms. Tamantha Turrel, not causing any problems today?”



I winced at his words; this was the problem with tiny towns and villages. Everyone knew everyone and, worse, knew all the nonsense they got up to as kids. “No, sir, Mayor Prescott, I'm just enjoying the fair. Promise.” I was a bit of a hellion growing up, and frequently got stern talking-to’s by the mayor and local sheriff, Tom Carson. Despite my reservations on dating the damnable cookie thief, Scott and I were thick as thieves when we were kids, always getting into trouble, and thankfully his dad would let us go with a slap on the wrist. Yay nepotism.



“Mhmm, I’m sure, Trouble.” I blushed at the old nickname. “Scott is helping out with the dunk tank, would you mind lending him a hand? Someone needs to run the game while he gets drenched.”



A smirk filled with schadenfreude crossed my face as I happily agreed. He pointed me in the right direction and I made my way through the milling throngs that only seemed to grow as the day wore on. When I got to the tank, the six-foot, ginger lunk was sitting on the small diving board looking exceptionally bored. When he saw me approaching, he immediately groaned. “No. No. No, not you, come on” He whined out, dragging out the n of on like a petulant child.



“Sorry, Scooter, mayor's orders,” I grinned up at him maliciously. He rolled his eyes and stuck out his tongue.



“How ya been, Trouble, break anyone's nose recently?” the bakery burglar cheeked back.



“Steal any poor defenseless maiden’s sweets recently?” I asked in reply.



He snorted. “I never once stole any maiden’s sweets. I valiantly fought a dragon for her hoard,” He defended his honor with lies and slander.



I stared at him with a raised eyebrow, before raising my fist to the target that served as the idiot’s drop switch. He scoffed, “Cheater. For real though, Tammy, how ya been? I hardly ever see you anymore.”



“If you left that farm of yours more than once a year, maybe I’d grace you with my beautiful visage,” I let my words linger for a second in false pretension before letting out a long sigh, the weight of last night’s events coming back in full force. “Honestly though, something followed me home last night. I'm a little freaked out.”

 

That got his attention quickly and he straightened up like a soldier on his little plywood seat. “What the hell? You’re not hurt, are you?”



“I’m fine, Scott. I won't get my deposit back though. Whatever it was scratched my door the hell up. It might have been a wolf.” After a quick glance around, seeing no one coming toward us, I leaned closer to his Plexiglas tank. “Promise not to laugh?” He nodded and leaned in. “I think it was a huge werewolf,” I whispered to him. He immediately reeled back, laughing. His stupid belly laugh only infuriated me. “I’m serious, Scott! There are freaking claw marks at the top of my door!"" I stamped my foot, my face flushing red at the admittedly crazy things leaving my mouth.



His peels of laughter died down, seeing my pissed-off face. “All right, fine, fine, you got a werewolf stalker. Want me to get some silver bullets and come over tonight?” He could barely hide his building giggle fit behind a poker face that had gotten us into trouble more than once. The not-so-little shit.



“Yes,” I pouted, turning my crimson face away from him. I noticed with vindictive glee a group of teens heading our way. “Hey, come on over and try to dunk the village idiot!” I yelled out, pointing to the poorly painted graphic on the side of the dunk tank showing the price. “Only a dollar a throw!” The surge of euphoria I felt as they hurried our way and Scott's squawk of indignation was glorious.



The boys walked up, forking over the cash quickly. After I handed them their baseballs, they got lined up behind the line painted into the grass with spray paint, and immediately sent the big moron to his watery punishment. Peals of laughter escaped the boys at Scott's horrified yelp as he plunged into the chill water; his shaggy orange hair made him look like a wet sheepdog as he emerged from the depths grumbling about evil women. The rest of our afternoon continued like that: banter, fake arguments, and me egging passersby to come dunk him whenever he got the upper hand. I wish I knew it would be the last time I ever heard the big guy’s laugh.



As sunset rolled around, I helped Scott out of the tank and followed him over to the nearby ice cream parlor that was being used as a public restroom. He dried off and got changed before rejoining me. “Hey Tam, sorry for laughing earlier. My offer still stands if you're not feeling safe. Although I don’t think I have any silver bullets. A .45 usually stops whatever you put it into,” he said, showing me the pistol he's keeping hidden under a button-up shirt. It was hanging in an appendix carry holster, looking like his dad’s old 1911.



“I… I’d appreciate that,"" I told him haltingly. We strolled for a few minutes, the sunset’s purple and orange hues illuminating the world in a soft glow. The braziers scattered around the park were lit by volunteers, casting an almost comforting glow around the quickly darkening world. That's when I saw Mrs. Harriet.



“Mrs. Harriet!” I ran up, Scott on my heels like a lovesick puppy as I jogged up to my boss. She kept walking toward the stage oblivious to us. “Mrs. Harriet, how are you?” I asked once we got to her side.



She kept walking, not looking over at us. “Come on, dear, we can’t be late for the prayer.” She led the way to the stage in a quick old lady shuffle, excited to share a moment of her youth with us. I could do without praying to a God I don't believe in, but I supposed indulging an old lady wouldn't kill me, so I followed. As we arrived, we were a bit late, managing to snag the lucrative spot at the very back of the crowd. She finally acknowledged our presence fully. “Oh, so you did take my advice, dear?” Her smirk was insufferable. “No sneaking off to go make out, the end of the festival is the best part, dear.” Turning from my flustered self, she looked over at Scott. “You behave too, little scooter.”



Seeing she turned us both into tongue-tied messes, she gave out a quick cackle of old-lady laughter before turning to the stage, as the mayor walked out to the center of it wearing a weird cloak. It was a shade of green that reminded me of the deep woods right at the cusp of night, or the depths of the ocean. “Dwellers of Hikatoba!” The mayor’s voice boomed out, the speakers on stage barely working but in the hushed silence of twilight his voice carried far and loud. “Tonight we celebrate the equinox, and harvest for the Lord.”



“Rush’tavg,” the voices of the older villagers resonated out in the park. It was then I noticed everyone under 30 was in the center of the group with only me and Scott being outliers. I looked at him quizzically, silent, trying to ask him if he knew what the hell the old folks just said. He just shrugged, shaking his head no.



“When the moon is at its zenith, the harvest shall begin and our worship shall be rewarded!” the mayor continued, uncaring of the confusion spreading among the youngest members of the village. Some fearfully chatted, and looked around.



“Rush’tavg,” the elders chanted once more, and I was brutally reminded of last night's events as the feeling of being watched resurfaced once again. The moon began to rise, a sickly pale green glow emanating off of it as it peeked through the tree line, looking far larger than ever before. It was like someone had pulled it hundreds of miles toward the earth, and it felt like it was staring down on the village's ritual.



“The time of celestial alignment is upon us, my flock, raise your voice and bring forth your prayers for the Lord,” the mayor intoned to the gathered mass as a slow fog crept into the clearing.



“Rush’tavg,” the monotone chant echoed out once more. I looked over and saw Mrs. Harriet's eyes were clouded over in a midnight black. She looked like she was possessed. With a loud thud, my eyes were wrenched back to the stage as a new, large, inhuman figure took up its place behind the mayor. It was shaped like a hound, but completely wrong. It was about ten feet tall, sitting on its haunches. Its body seemed to shift and rip open, revealing maws lined with sharpened canines, and eyes that looked to be cut from jade—all color, no pupil, no cornea. Where eyes would be on a normal dog, the mutant mutt had additional slobbering maws, tongues hanging freely, pointed and coated in sickening red goopy slobber. Its eyeless head fixated on me for a moment, and the feeling of being watched increased a thousandfold.



“The Lord is pleased with this season's harvest! He has sent his carrier to us.” The mayor preached to his faithful, uncaring of the fearful murmurs of the gathered young at the center of the crowd. Scott grabbed my arm, pulling my attention from the hound’s unfaltering stare. My mind pounded as he motioned with his head. I nodded in agreement to his unspoken plan to run while we could.



“Rush’tavg Nah Vir Sah’tohem,” the crowd began to chant and raise their arms. Scott and I slowly backed away, keeping our eyes locked on the occult scene before us. I swear the sky flashed, lit up in an ethereal green like the aurora borealis had decided to appear. It was gone before I could blink, and the hound stood, its eyeless sockets in its face still locked on us. The elders’ arms lowered, locking in a ring around the younger townsfolk, and the beast stepped down among them. Its eye tongues lashed out, tasting and sampling frightened young adults and children. It stopped in front of Susan Chalimege, a 7-year-old kid who would come by the coffee shop for baked goods we’d sell. It took a long sniff of her face before snorting and looking back up at me, the various shifting eyes across its body squinting before it gave out a low bark. The bass of it reverberated through my bones even though Scott and I were almost a football field away. The sky flashed again, longer this time. There were swirls of the cloudy green substance in the sky writhing through the air like great worms swimming through the ether. They were gone a moment later.



Scott and I turned after the abomination barked and started sprinting down the road. We could hear the creature's thunderous paws pound the ground behind us in a haunting rhythm. It felt like death itself was chasing us down the road. Its low, resonating howl echoed in the night air. The fearful cries of the children in the park and the mayor's elated shout of “The carrier has chosen this season's harvest!” acted as sickening backup singers to the howl’s lead vocals. Realizing either Scott or I was chosen by some fucked-up mix of hound and demon as a sacrifice made us run even harder.



Once we made it halfway to my place, Scott turned to me, his face hauntingly gorgeous backlit by the ever-flickering sky, black tendrils now sweeping the cosmic green slurry in the flashes. “Go, I’ll slow it down. Get somewhere safe, Trouble,” His words greatly irked me as he pulled the pistol and started to slow down.



“The hell you will, Scott Mathias Carson! You have to protect me from werewolves tonight!” I screamed at him, tears beginning to form in my eyes knowing what the idiot was planning.



He just gave me that damn lopsided smile before whispering, “I am.” He stopped completely and turned. “Get safe and leave this shithole like ya always wanted to, Trouble! I got this!” His yell was accompanied by hot stinging trails of tears scorching down my cheeks as I kept running. The gunshots behind me echoed hollowly into the night, each blast emphasized with another flash from the sky, its eyes watching me in cruel indifference. They were emeralds, like the abomination’s eyes but blown up to massive size like blimps in the sky. At that scale you could see the center looked like waterfalls into endless voids of green, a strange depth endless but visible. My head throbbed in pain as I ran into my door. The gunshots went silent and the screaming started as I fumbled my keys trying desperately to get them into the damn lock. The key slotted into the lock and the screaming stopped with a sickening squelching pop.



I slammed my door shut, hoping it was up for a repeat of last night's performance, as I huddled in my closet. I pulled out my phone and started to write this warning. Hopefully whatever is covering the sky can't block wifi. Even now, after writing this all out, I can hear the beast pounding on my door using Scott’s voice trying to get me to leave. “Trouble, come on. You were chosen. It's a great honor.” I can feel the moon's loving gaze bearing down fully on the village, its tendrils reaching down and tenderly caressing the streets. Please heed my warning: Hikatoba is gone, do not come.",1,1760795828.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I’m a registered nurse living on the Gold Coast, Australia. I’ve been here my whole life but now i’m wanting a change of scenery. I’ve been wanting to move to Canada for as long as I can remember and finally have the funds (and the guts) to do it.
It looks like moving to Nova Scotia is going to be the quickest and easiest regarding my nursing registration. It looks beautiful and I’m very excited to do it. 

My big questions are,
- I’m used to big cities, having only lived in GC and Brisbane, so what areas in NS would be best?

- The hospitals - I am specialised in Respiratory and Thoracic Medicine, what hospitals would be best?

- I’m only 24 and going to be doing the move by myself, so I’m wondering what the demographics are in certain areas and how receptive people are

- What is nursing like in Canada? 

- What is the coffee like? We’re very fussy with coffee here in Australia and I’m not sure how I’ll give it up hahaha

- Do you have a program like flatmates? To help you find roommates or people renting out a room?

September 1, 1939

	

I was sixteen when the war started. I was sixteen when I heard the big BOOM and watched as dust and fire shot up to the sky. I was sixteen when I hugged my father and watched him drive away, along with my uncles and my older brother. I was sixteen when I stood on the sidewalk watching in horror as my house burned bright, the flames consuming the only home I have ever known. I was sixteen as I stood at the graves of my mother and baby sister. I was sixteen when I knocked on my neighbors’ doors begging for scraps. I was sixteen when the war started, when the birds stopped singing.



Chapter 1    



October 12th, 1939



I ran through the fields, the blood on the grass sticking to my bare feet. Men are screaming around me, running to escape the cold bloody hands of the men in the black and white uniforms. They were running to the water. The water that will take them away from this hell hole. I followed them…

When I reached the water, I stared off into the distance, as the men around me jumped into the water swimming for the two boats that remained. Tears were running down my face, but I did not move. Just then a sizzling is heard from above. I stare up at a missile heading straight for one of the boats. I closed my eyes and held my breath as fire and dust overcame the air. It shot me backward. I flew to the ground, hitting my head on a rock. I opened my eyes for a split second to see the lifeless bodies of men laying around me burning bright. I laid there still and silent. I heard the sizzling sound again as another missile headed for the last boat. I closed my eyes. 

I’m coming, family…

The boom hit and everything went dark.





	

I wake up shivering. I stood up as snow poured down upon me. I pulled on my cap and slipped my boots onto my icy feet. I wrapped my thin blue blanket that I had slept on that night. The only thing I had left from my home, my family, my past. I slowly walked out of the alley heading for Marty’s cafe. My feet and hands were blue and I couldn't wait to bathe in the warmth of the cafe. 

“James my boy, there you are!” Marty yelled with his deep Irish accent. 

“Good morning, Marty,” I replied. “Good to see you again. Any news?”

“None involving me. But did you hear, old Mr. Robert and his wife were taken this morning.”

I shook my head with disgust, as I poured myself a mug of hot chocolate. I sat down on a chair by the counter. Marty looked me up and down with sad eyes.

“Still living on the streets, eh?” he said, concerned. 

I nodded slowly, staring down at my hot chocolate, the warmth of the cup heating my fingers and turning them back to the faint brown color they were. Marty's face lit up like lights at church on Sunday morning. 

“Son, you know the Thomas family moved out of the upstairs apartment yesterday. I don’t got any takers for it. You’d be more than welcome to have it. It's getting way too cold out there for you now.” 

I smiled at Marty's sweet eyes and his cherry nose. I bit my lip and stared down at my clothes and feet. Maybe Marty is right, I can't stay out here much longer. I looked up at him. “Thanks Marty, I think that would be perfect. But tell me … did the Thomas family really move out or … were they … taken?”

He didn't answer right away. Just stared at his coffee.

“They were planning to hide,” he said softly. “I heard them last night talking about it. But someone ratted them out. The soldiers came and they were gone by five this morning.” 

“Oh my gosh,” I gasped. “All five of them?”

Marty sighed and sat down next to me. His voice cracked and I could see the pain in his eyes.

“No. Only 4.” 



October 13, 1939



	I slowly walked up the stairs to my new apartment, carrying my brown blanket in one hand and my cup of hot chocolate in the other. Most of my things had been burned in the fire. I didn't have many belongings to worry about. I reached the seventh floor and paused when I grasped the handle, the cold metal sending goosebumps up my arm. A shiver, a deep breath. The door opened with a creak and light quickly flooded inside the room. A sudden wave of cold air overwhelmed me the moment I stepped in. The room was a complete mess. Smashed vases and glasses littered the floor; paintings torn from the wall lay in pieces; bags of clothes piled in heaps, with one very small shirt– small enough for a baby–hanging from the light above me. It was soaked in blood and dripped on my nose as I stared up at it.

I walked into the bedroom and sat on the bed. All of the thoughts I spent my days burying–thoughts that weighed me down with every step I took–were slipping through cracks in the silence. I could hear them now, I could see it all before me. So I cried. I cried for my father, my brother, and my uncles. I cried for Mr. Robert and his wife, for the Thomas family, and for my mother and little sister. I even cried over the bloody shirt, and for the baby that would never wear it again. Yet the one that I cried for the most was Marty, because Marty… was Jewish. 



The next day when I woke up, I found a fresh pair of pants, a big plaid shirt, boots and a coat waiting for me outside my door. I put them on and they were warm and smelled like honey. 

I went downstairs early that morning for a cup of coffee and the newspaper. I grabbed it from the doorstep and sat in one of the red velvet booths. It had been a month since my father and brother left but it felt like forever ago. So much has changed. I could barely walk down the streets of Amsterdam without seeing one soldier or a broken window. 

It was 6:00 AM and Marty was not awake yet, so I decided to go down the road and pick up some fresh eggs and milk. I put on my new coat and boots before walking out the door. It was cold, and rainy. But I wanted to get something special for Marty for letting me stay in the upstairs apartment. Marty loved bread but since he was Jewish he wasn't allowed to go into any bakeries and buy some. Figured I'd do it myself.

	I grabbed an old basket that I found on the ground covered in snow. I dusted it off and grabbed a small handkerchief from my coat pocket and used it as a blanket for the eggs. When I got to the bakery the lights were off and the door was locked. I peered through the window but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. 

“Who goes there!” a booming German voice called from behind me. 

I spun around dropping the basket, causing some of the eggs to break. In front of me there was a very tall, stern man wearing a suit that had medals on the front and along the arms. There was a rifle slung over his shoulder and two giant German shepherds baring their teeth at my face. I searched for something to say but the words were catching in my throat.

“Antworte mir, Junge!” he yelled, tightening his grip on the dogs as they stepped closer. *Answer me, boy* – that's what he said. Hours and hours of endless German lessons had helped with that. 

“I was just going to get some bread,” I said slowly in German.

“A whole loaf of bread for a small fellow like you? Seems like a waste, doesn't it?”

“It's for a friend!” I tried to stay calm but it was hard not to think about how quickly those dogs could rip me to shreds.

“A friend?” the soldier snapped. “Why is it that he could not get it himself?” 

Sweat dripped down my forehead. “He’s… He’s sick! Very sick!” A pause, a moment to collect myself. “Yeah, he just came down with a fever this morning.” 

The soldier glanced skeptically toward my basket. “Very well then,” he muttered.

I walked over to pick up the basket, but the dogs were already swallowing the eggs whole while the soldier finished chugging the milk, wiping the thick line of white upon his lips. 

“Sorry. I guess the boys slipped through my fingers!”

He walked off with a smirk. I sighed and grabbed the now empty basket, walking back to the stand to replace the eggs and milk before they ran out. Marty was going to have to wait for that bread.

As I sauntered home, rain tapped against my back and picked up with each step. I passed more broken homes and shops, once full of jolly consumers and their families– their cars left abandoned on the side of the road with shattered windows, shells of the transport to Sunday breakfast, never to be driven again. Much like it was at the bakery, there was nothing I could do to remedy any of this. The world as I knew it was forever broken, and I was forever incapable of doing anything about it. 

A crunch under my foot stole my attention; a watch, glass shattered, with black leather straps.

“I’m sorry, Dad,” I whispered.

The cafe was quiet when I arrived. I wasn’t looking forward to giving Marty the bad news – there was enough of that around here already. But as I stepped inside, I saw that the windows were broken and the door was off the hinges and on the ground. 

“Marty?” I panicked. No response. I paused to listen but all I could hear was my heartbeat in my ears. “Marty, where are you!”

I ran up the stairs, where photos once lined along the wall lay scattered. I skipped to the top and barged into his room.

There was no sight of him. I ran back downstairs hoping he was hiding in the pantry, but he wasn’t. I walked over to the broken window and looked out into the dark street. Across the road, an apartment was being raided by Nazis. They were marching families out into the cold – elderly, young couples, children. I stood and watched as the Nazi’s forced them into the back of the truck where they disappeared into darkness. They began lowering the sliding door when a deep voice called out from the alleyway next to the cafe.

“Wait! I have one more!” a Nazi officer shouted as he came out of the shadows. 

I stopped breathing and fell to my knees, the glass from the windows cutting my legs; the officer walked across the street to the truck, *dragging Marty behind him.* He was scraped up and bloody. Tears ran down my face but I couldn’t stop them. Marty looked at me for a split second, his eyes silently warning me to stay quiet. If I made a sound, I'd be taken to a camp too. I watched as they threw him into the truck and slowly drove away. 

I was alone. Again. 

  


Chapter 2



*Four Years Earlier*

August 30th, 1935



	I’ve always wanted to see the Statue of Liberty. It was my lifelong dream. When my dad went to New York last month, I was so jealous. He brought me home this comic book. It was about this bad guy who only wanted people to think about him and nobody else. So he used this brain washing machine to wipe out everybody's minds. Then this superhero named Batman came and saved everyone. Dad told me that the real copy wasn't coming out until 1939 but I was able to get a special edition.

“Here,” I said to my best friend David as we walked to school, holding the comic book out for him to take. “Just in case.”

He looked at me funny. “I can’t take this,” he gasped.

“I want you to remember me!”

David nodded and begrudgingly accepted my gift. “I wish I didn't have to leave.”

“Me too … But you’ll be back soon. And when you do, we’ll take a trip to New York together and see the Statue of Liberty!”

David smiled but it didn’t cover up the tear that I saw roll down his cheek. 

  


October 14th, 1939



	After Marty was taken, the cafe was overrun by Nazis. I was left to live on the streets again, the icy road sliding beneath my feet as I wandered the ghost of my home town. Thank god I still had those boots and jacket, the very same I’d worn all those times I’d walked to school with David. I wondered if he even remembered who I was. I hadn’t known it then but the whole reason David left was because of the war. His father was Jewish but his mother was Dutch. He stayed here with her for a while before they left for Sweden to join his father. I haven’t seen him since. 

Shortly after he left, my father took me to a hockey game to cheer me up. The local university was playing their rival out on the frozen pond. I’ll never forget the look in my father’s eye when a goal was scored, like he wanted to let me bask in the small bit of joy we were able to have in this world.  Afterward, he told me the truth about David and his family. I was shocked. I didn't know what to think.

“Don't you look at him any differently,” my father had told me. “He's as much a human boy as you are.”

	

I walked 6 miles since leaving the cafe. The snow was getting thicker and taller as it piled up on the street. The wind sent shivers through my body. The sun slowly faded behind the gray clouds and I was left in complete darkness. I noticed a small farmhouse on the corner of the street. The lights were out and it looked abandoned. I crossed to the other side and peered through the window. I didn’t see much. Just a stove beside an old wooden table, adorned with one single vase in the center. The flowers inside still looked alive and pretty. I did not, however, see any people. I decided to go in. 

To my surprise the door was unlocked but let out a very loud creak. I had to be careful. Not every neighbor was as kind as the ones I had growing up. Some were eager for a reason to contact the Nazi’s. Nothing made a common citizen more dangerous than the perception of some power. 

I stepped inside and quietly closed the door behind me. The open-plan living room was left in a familiar state of disarray, so I continued further inside to the kitchen. The wallpaper was white and covered in small sunflowers, at least from what I could tell of what was left of it. Most of it was torn and drooping down toward the floor. I spotted an old wooden picture frame by my feet, as though greeting me. The glass was broken, the frame cracked. I took the picture out of the frame and lit a small oil lamp with some matches that were left by the stove. The picture showed a family of farmers. The father matched his two younger boys, each of them in overalls and white t-shirts, and a wheat hat. The mother wore a faint pink dress with her hair done up in a bun. Next to her stood a younger girl, probably about 17. She had a short sleeved yellow dress on and her long, curly brown hair covered her shoulders. They all looked so happy.

I heard a small *click* behind me. I turned around to see a hooded figure standing in the \[A man going through hell, as he realizes what has become of his life after visiting a willow tree with his fiancé.\] doorway of the kitchen, pointing a rifle right at my chest. I dropped the photo and put my hands above my head.

“Don't shoot!” I cried. “Please!” 

The rifle fires and I feel a searing pain as the bullet drives through my left leg. I fall to the ground trying to muffle my own cries but the pain is too much. My ears are ringing and the last thing I see is the hooded figure standing above me. They slowly pry off the hood and in my blinding daze, I catch a glimpse of the shooter. It's a girl. My eyes close and everything fades to darkness. 



	I see my brother waving to me as he drives off. I see my mother crying as she reads the letter from the army. I saw the cafe the morning Marty was taken. I see him being dragged in the snow. I see the Nazi and those dogs interrogating me for buying food. I see the hooded figure standing above me with a rifle. They shoot at my heart and then…I wake up. 

	The room smells like honey and is dimly lit by a candle. I try to sit up but find it extremely painful so I lay back down. I reach my arm out to my leg to see how badly I was injured but I only find the softness of a bandage wrapped tightly where I was shot. I look around the room and find that I must have been found by the Nazis and now I was trapped in their custody just waiting to be thrown into jail, or worse. 

Then the door behind me opens and a young girl about my age steps through. She’s wearing black pants with a white shirt tucked into them, covered by an unzipped hoodie and black leather jacket. Her hair is wrapped tightly in a (ponytail) \[*ponytail wasn’t a phrase until the 1950’s. Have to check what they would’ve called it in Germany in the 1930’s*\] with a few loose strands tucked behind her ears. She’s also wearing big boots that almost reach her knees. She walked over and sat in a chair a couple feet away from where I lay. The two cups in her hands were boiling, steam rising from the top. She doesn't offer me one, but instead sits there watching me. 

“Sorry I shot you. I thought you were a Nazi,” she says, slowly placing the cup on the table beside me. A hint of mint wafts my way but I don’t reach for it, not yet.

“It’s just tea,” the girl assures me.

Reluctantly, I take a sip and keep my eyes on her.  

“So… you speak English too?” I say. Since losing my family, I hadn't met one person that spoke English other than Marty. It was always German. 

“My family is from America. We moved here last year.” She’s still staring at me as if she was waiting for a hint of fraud in my voice. The rifle laid against her chair ready to shoot if need be. 

“My parents are from America too,” I explain. “But we have been living here my whole life.” I try sitting up. It doesn't seem to hurt my leg but a shooting pain hits my head causing me to grit my teeth and lay back against the pillows. “I thought you were a Nazi,” I added, looking into her eyes. They are a deep emerald green. I can see old memories she had with her family, but I can also see trauma. She's all alone, just like me. 

“Of course I'm not a nazi!” she exclaims, offended. But her tone shifts, her grip on the gun loosening. “I thought you were too, until I saw your jacket. Who gave it to you?” 

I closed my eyes tightly remembering Marty being dragged away and thrown into the car to be taken away. 

“An old friend,” I tell her. “How would you recognize it?” 

“Who do you think made it?” she says with a grin. 

I'm surprised that a person so tough looking and young would sit down for a few days and make a jacket such as the one I was wearing not even 24 hours ago. A thought strikes my mind and I find myself unable to keep from asking. 

“Did you know anyone named Marty Byrne?” I ask, dropping my gaze to the well designed velvet carpet below me. 

Her grin fades and she takes a deep breath. “He was friends with my father. When we first moved in my father gave him a tour of the house, but when he saw the old Ping Pong table in the basement he was so excited. They played all afternoon. He would come over every Saturday after that just to play with my father…” The memory plays in her mind but her laugh was coated in guilt, like it was wrong to reminisce on such a happy memory. She continued, more subdued this time. “One time while my brothers were still out working, I snuck down there and sat at the top step listening to them play. Marty saw me and offered to teach me. He said I was a champ.” She sighs. “That was a week before the war…”

I sat there listening to her story, wondering why Marty had never told me about his love for Ping Pong or that he played it every week. Maybe he could have taught me how to play too. I wonder what other things he used to do in his life, things that he might never do again. 

“He was my best friend,” I say softly. “Offered me a place to stay for a while when I was living on the streets. When the war started, my father and brother went to fight for America and left me to care for my mother and baby sister. A week after I was out, a fire started and my house went up in flames, trapping them both inside and…” 

A numbness ran through my arms all the way to my hands. I was frozen. The girl set aside her gun and leaned in closer to me.

“What happened?” she whispered.

I shook my head, as though shaking away the images in my mind. “I couldn’t save them. I was too young to fight back then so I was left on the side of the road. And now that I’m older, I’m still not sure I’m ready to fight. Marty…” 

The girl helps me sit up and forces me to take small sips of the tea. She then walks over to the mantle across the room and returns with a small photo. It's a picture of Marty and the same man from the photo I saw in the kitchen before. 

“You? You're the girl with the sunflower dress?” I say. She smiles and nods. “What’s your name?” I ask. 

“Samantha Goldberg. But everybody calls me Sam. What’s yours?” 

“James Moriarty. What happened to your family, if you don't mind me asking?” 

She stands like a statue, gripping the mantle as though she may fall over. 

“We're jewish,” she begins. “They barged into our house and dragged my family out into the streets. Shooting them one by one. I saw it, through the attic window. I had been studying with my father when they came. He heard the door being ripped off its hinges and ran down to stop them. The way he’d looked back at me… I knew he wasn't coming back. None of them were. *‘Stay here Sam, don't move and don't make a sound.’* That was the last thing he told me. So I just sat there and watched. Frozen. Helpless. Remembering my father’s words. *Stay here, Sam. Stay here.* It ran through my brain over and over until the Nazis drove away. Then I was alone.” 

A tear slides down her cheek as she turns away to hide it.

“I'm so sorry,” I say. It's the only thing I can think of to say because I know nothing is going to make her feel better. I sit up to make room for her on the couch beside me and she drops down on the other side, wiping the tears with her sleeve. 

“I felt so useless,” she sobs. “There was nothing I could do to save my family.”

I use my hand to cover hers. She looks over at me.

“I know what that feels like. Feeling like you failed your family. A week after the war started my brother came home from work and told me that he enlisted to fight. He said that I was lucky I was too young. He said that there was only one thing worse than Hell and it was war, because Hell only affects horrible people, but war affects everyone. Not just the boys fighting, but the innocent families left behind. He said he would try to be brave, but I could see behind those tough eyes; there was a scared boy not ready for what was to come. Despite what he had told me, I still wished I could fight. But when my father told me to look after my mother and sister I felt like I had a new responsibility to protect them no matter what. But when my house went up in flames, I just watched… I had never felt more useless…” 

It was the first time I’d truly spoken of the incident since it happened. I trusted Sam. In a world riddled with all sorts of suffering, we understood each other’s pain. In a lot of ways, we are the same. 

I'm crying now but unlike Sam, I don't try to hide it. She grips my hand tightly. We sit there in silence thinking about how unfortunate we are until a thought strikes my mind.

“If you realized I wasn't a Nazi when you saw my jacket, why did you shoot me?” I wonder.

“I wanted to make sure you couldn't run away. The Nazis haven't found me here yet and I’d like to keep it that way. But I must say, I’m glad I shot you.” My brow pinched as she explained, “I haven’t talked to someone in a really long time. I’d forgotten how nice it was.”



\*\*NOTES:

Okay so WOW. Love this scene between James and Sam. This is where a lot of your set-up finally gets that emotional payoff. Everything with James’ past and Marty all comes together here and really gives the reader a sense of what James’ WANT is for this story. You did a great job here. I can feel the sense of hopelessness and helplessness. And that need to do something–which is what I think and hope is coming next!

Things to help you improve:



What tense do you want this story to be in? I notice that sometimes you’ll end dialogue with “I say” instead of “I said”. But then other times you’ll put something like “I cried” instead of “I cry”. Is the story in present tense or past tense? Either one is fine! Just have to choose one and stick with it–but it’s entirely up to you! If you want it to feel like it’s happening now, the obviously present tense. 

So you’ll write things like this: “Hey Cote, Nettle is going to be weird without you,” **I say** to him. He walks over and sits down, looking sad. 

But if you want the story to feel more like it’s being told by James after he’s already experienced it, then you’d write in past tense like this: “Hey Cote, Nettle is going to be weird without you,” **I said** to him. He walked over and sat down, looking sad.

See the difference? Again, up to you! Neither one is bad! Just depends how you want your story to feel.

Another thing. Sensory cues. You don’t need them all the time. I’ve talked to you before about this I think–but basically it just means that you don’t always need to write the senses out like “I can see” “I can hear” “I can feel”. 

Example: “I can see the tears falling down her face.”

You can just write: “Tears fell down her face.” You don’t need to say that your character is using their eyes to see it–we know that already lol. It’s okay to do it sometimes, especially if it’s necessary–smell and taste are kind of hard to describe without it– but when you’re editing, keep an eye out for them and just reword it if you notice you’re doing it a lot. Another example: “I can hear gunshots outside.” Can just be: “Gunshots rang somewhere outside.” The fact that the narrator is saying it means we already know they are hearing it! I’d say only use the sensory cues if it’s relevant, like if it was a foggy day and your character says “I can see a faint light in the distance, a ship coming over the horizon.” At least there, being able to see is kind of relevant.

You’re smart, I think you get it lol.



	Also, you don’t always have to add a dialogue tag (things like “he said” “she asked”) Once you establish who the speakers are, you can stop using them since we know that a new paragraph just means it’s the other speaker. But if a conversation goes on long enough, then you can always sprinkle in another tag. I’ll write a little example:

	“Hey,” I said with a wave. Cote was already sitting in the cafeteria when I walked in.

“You’re here early,” he grinned.

“Couldn’t sleep. Too excited for floor hockey today.”

“How many goals today?”

“Maybe five,” I said. “I’m going to go easy on them today.”

Cote laughed. “I like the sound of that. Just make sure I get the assists!”



So in that example, I start with you talking and I use the tag “I said”. Then it changes to me, and I use “he grinned”. But now that I’ve established that it’s just you and me talking, I don’t need to keep writing dialogue tags because the reader knows that the next line is back to you, then back to me, and so on. But after a few lines of no tags, I throw in a “I said” just to keep the reader on track to who is speaking. (This obviously changes when there are more than two speakers in a conversation. You will have to use tags more frequently in that scenario to keep the reader aware of who is talking.) Note how I put the “I said” in the middle of that sentence, just to mix up the flow once in a while. Also note how I use an action to break up the flow too, by putting “Cote laughed” at the beginning and then just put the dialogue with no tag. This is another way of showing who is talking without having to always add a tag at the end. If I write (Rose tapped her stick hard to the floor. “Pass it!”) then I know that it’s you who is talking without having to put “she yelled” or something. So sprinkle in some action cues to keep the flow from getting too stagnant like this: 

“Hey,” I said with a wave. 

“You’re here early,” he grinned.

“Couldn’t sleep. Too excited for floor hockey today,” I said.

“How many goals today?” he asked.

“Maybe five. I’m going to go easy on them today,” I replied.

“I like the sound of that. Just make sure I get the assists!” Cote cried.



Yuck.



  

Other than that, this is incredible. I’m really amazed at your writing ability, especially your ability to write about such heavy topics like war, and the Holocaust–and that you do it so well! You’re seriously very talented and you’re only going to get better! I’ll continue going through the story again soon. Hope this helps, and let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.





	

Chapter 3



November 20th 1940



It took a couple of weeks for my leg to heal but Sam had some medicine stored in her basement that was still good and it worked like a charm. She said her father used to be a doctor before the war. I started walking yesterday but this morning I took a quick jog around the house and my leg was basically good as new. Me and Sam have gotten to be good friends, especially since she let me stay at the house as long as I wanted. We played some old board games and listened to a podcast about the allies on a radio that belonged to Sam’s brothers. And with my leg working again I have been the one going out and getting food, water, ammo, and more medicine. I didn't want to risk Sam going out in public with the Nazis roaming around. 



I woke up just as the snow was beginning to pile up outside. I looked around the living room to find that Sam must still be sleeping because I couldn't find her anywhere. I walked over to the toaster that rested on the kitchen table. I placed a thin white piece of bread into the toaster and began to heat a cup of water in the kettle. Nobody could afford coffee anymore so heated water was the best anyone could do. I grabbed the jam out of the cupboard and began to smear it on my toast. I put on my jacket and boots and the hat that used to belong to Sam’s father. I walked out the door still clutching my toast in my hand. I closed the door behind me and began towards town. I tried to keep a low profile so as to not attract any unwanted attention from the Nazis. I passed lots of buildings that were abandoned. Broken glass littered the streets. 



I decided to see what stores might be open at this time so I walked down main street. It was dark and quiet but there was always one place still open. Daniel's Diner. It was always open, 24 hours 7 days a week. Some people even say that there are ovens in the bunker so they can keep cooking during a bombing. I walked through the door and a bell went off above my head. It would have been completely empty if it weren't for the Nazi sitting at the counter. I kept my gaze down and sat in a red velvet booth in the back of the diner. The waiter came over with a pen and small notepad. He was a short stocky looking man, who looked to be about 56 years old. ""So what are you looking for today son?"" he asked. 

""I'll just have some toast and eggs please"" I replied trying not to look at the Nazi. 

""We're all out of eggs, may I interest you in some grit instead?""

I was disappointed that there were no eggs but I wasn't surprised either. The war had caused a lot of food to be unobtainable. Most were sent to the soldiers. 

""Yes, that would be great, thank you"" I said. 

After he walked away I couldn't help but notice the blonde haired Nazi walking towards me. He held a mug of a steaming black liquid. I guess coffee wasn't too expensive for them. He sat down across from me and that is when I realized. It's the same Nazi that dragged Marty out of that alley all those weeks ago, and here he was sitting right across from me in a diner. He stared at me for a long time, not saying a word. 

""Can I help you?"" I asked the Nazi. 

""Yes, I think you can. You look like the kind of person who could fight. Have you ever thought of joining the Nazi regime and fighting for the Fuhrer?"" He asked me.

I was stunned. It must have shown on my face too because the Nazi sighed with disappointment. 

“I can't fight,” I said. “I'm only sixteen.” 

	He slowly stood up, clenching his mug so tightly his knuckles turned white. He leaned in towards my face and I tried not to pull away. His breath smelt like smoke and his teeth were yellow. 

	“There are over 200 kids in the Hitler Youth. And many of them are sixteen.” he whispered. “There is no need to make excuses not to serve your country.” 

	I sat up straighter and looked up into the nazis eyes. “No, but there is an excuse not to kill innocent people in camps.” I said. 

	The Nazi scowled and left the diner without a word. I grabbed a pen out of my pocket and quickly wrote on the napkin. Sorry, I had to run. You can eat my meal. I was sure the waiter would be happy about that. I ran out of the diner and down the street. I had to get out of the area fast, just in case they sent another Nazi to arrest me for what I said about the camps. When I reached the house there was a small glow coming from the kitchen. Sam must be awake. I opened the door and quickly took off my coat and boots. I had to tell her what happened. 

	“Sam, you won't beli…” I said as I walked in the kitchen, shocked to find two Nazis standing by the stove. 



Chapter 4



	I stopped short. There in front of me were two very tall, black haired Nazis, although one of them was a female. 

	“Hello, may I help you?” I asked slowly, walking towards them. 

“Hello sir, my name is Oskar Dirlewanger and this is my partner, Hermine Braunsteiner.” He gestured to the women by his side. “We are here to investigate this house. Make sure it is just as abandoned as it was when we first killed the family.”

My heart stopped, were these the Nazis that murdered Sam’s family. They couldn't investigate this house, Sam was still here, they would take her to a camp and kill me for hiding a Jew. I tried my best not to look scared, but I think the shock on my face was obvious because the Nazis tightened their grip on their guns.

“Will that be a problem sir?” officer Direwanger said, stepping forward.

“No, it's no problem!” I said, trying not to mumble my German. “Would you like me to show you around?” 

“That's okay, we can make our way around just fine,” it was the first time I had heard the women Nazi speak. What was her name again? Braunsteiner? I had never seen a female Nazi before but she was just as scary as the others, if not more. 

I stepped aside as the Nazis began to inspect every inch of the kitchen. They flew open cabinets and picked up the chairs. The pantry was raided even though there wasn't any food. They even shattered the vases and threw the flowers out the window. Officer Braunsteiner noticed the pain on my face at seeing Sam’s sunflowers thrown to the ground.

“I don't like those flowers, especially that color, '' she said smiling. They began to make their way into the living room but then Officer Braunsteiner noticed something on the back of the counter. It was the photo of Sam and her family. She picked it up and began to take the photo from the frame. She held the thin paper in her hand, examining it closely. Officer Dirlewanger walked over and took it from her hands. He pointed two fingers at Sam's father and brother. “These were the ones I shot. Did you get the mother and daughter?” He asked Braunsteiner. 

She shook her head. “No, I only got the mother,” she said. 

They both turned their heads and looked at me. Braunsteiner took back the photo from Dirlewanger and fumbled for something in her pocket. He grabbed me by the arm and threw me into the street. The shotgun came out so quickly. 

“WHERE IS SHE, YOU”RE HIDING HER PARENTS YOU!?” he screamed at my face, the gun driving into my neck. 

“I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS. THE HOUSE WAS EMPTY WHEN I CAME HERE!.” I yelled back. 

Just then officer Hermine Braunsteiner came walking out of the house holding Sam by her hair. “Found this one hiding in the attic!” 

Officer Dirlewanger put down the shotgun and struck me across the face. “Traitor. You are filth and deserve to die amongst the rats.” he gestured for Hermine to take Sam to the truck waiting across the street. Our eyes met and I could see how scared she was. She mouthed something but I couldn't catch it. Maybe I never would. I tried to tell her it's okay. To stay strong and it will all be over soon. But would it? Or would the war just go on forever, never ending, until all that was left was the Nazis and the people they brainwashed. So I just stood there and watched as Sam was thrown into the car, tears streaming down both of our faces. Officer Dirlewanger sighed and looked down at me.

“Why are you doing this, you're supposed to be a loyal man,” he said. 

I was shocked that he wasn't just throwing me in jail, but instead talking to me in a quiet whisper. 

“I didn't know she was there. I've been living alone since my family died. I swear,” I answered, trying to persuade him. He looked at me for a long time before sighing and pulling a note from his pocket.

“Look, I'm going to let you go but on one condition,” he said.

I nodded as he finished writing and handed me the note.

“I want you to go to the city hall and give them this note. The man there will give you a uniform and you'll be out fighting on the western front before new years,” he said.

“Sir, I am only sixte…” he cut me off before I could finish.

“I don't care how old you are, just do it. For your country and the Fuhrer.” he said, turning his back and walking to the truck.

I stared down at the note. It was written in German words I had never heard before. I couldn't read it. Officer Hermine finished loading Sam into the truck and began walking towards me. I slowly stood up expecting the worst. She pulled out a lighter and a folded piece of paper from her pocket. She unfolded it and held it out. It was the photo of Sam and her family.

“I guess you won't be needing this anymore,” she said before placing the small flame under the photo.

I just had enough time to see the sparkle of Sam's yellow dress before the flame took it over. The remains fluttered down into a puddle on the street as Officer Hermine boarded the truck and disappeared into the horizon and Sam along with it. 

I tried to stop shaking, stop crying but all I wanted to do was scream. They had no right to take Sam away from her home, her life, me. I staggered towards where the remains of the once beautiful photo was now floating in a puddle on the streets of Berlin. I picked it up and cradled it in my palm. It was badly burnt but you could still make out the dirty blonde hair and yellow dress that would be Sam.



I stuffed the photo into my coat pocket and screamed at the sky. I broke down and punched the street with my fists until they bled. I cried until I had no tears left. Then I got up, crumpled the note Officer Dirlewanger had given me, straightened my coat and began walking towards the edge of town. When I arrived at the place I walked inside and went straight to the front desk where an American officer sat taking notes.

“Hello, I would like to enlist to be a soldier in the American army!”",1,1760795493.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1o9wdom,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1o9wdom/alcoholic_parents_and_forgivness/,Alcoholic parents and forgivness.,"I’m a 27-year-old female. I’m posting to speak specifically with those who’ve had alcoholic—or maybe even drug-addicted—parents, as I’m sure this might resonate with you too.

I grew up in a lower-middle-class home with both parents. I have very fond memories of my early childhood. I was close with both my mother and father, but especially my mom. My two oldest siblings didn’t live with us as far back as I can remember since there’s almost a 20-year age gap, but I did live with my other two older brothers.

I remember when things took a turn. My brother Collin had autism and schizophrenia, and he started having violent outbursts. He would be so sweet and then just spiral, talking to voices. It was very scary. He attacked my dad and me violently. He didn’t mean to hurt us—he was just sick. Eventually, he became too much for my parents to handle. They tried different medications, but nothing seemed to work, so they gave him up to another foster family who could better care for someone like him. It broke their hearts, and I don’t think they ever truly got over it.

After that, my parents started drinking heavily. Not just because of that incident, but I think it was the culmination of unresolved pain and trauma from their pasts. I remember this starting when I was around 10. It was so hard seeing my parents go from sweet and fun-loving to mean, drunk, and angry.

When my other brother Travis left, I was alone with them. They would get physical with each other, scream and curse, and my father became very controlling. I honestly believe he has mental illness too—he’s always had very bizarre tendencies, but I won’t get into that.

I had to ask permission for simple things, like when I wanted to shower or eat. He stopped working because he wanted to “watch” me and my mom all day. He’d get drunk, harass my mom, and pick fights constantly. My mom and I shared a room—I didn’t have a space of my own. My dad had his own room. It was a small two-bedroom house.

Anyway, my mom and I would stay in the back room. She would get extremely drunk—like, blackout drunk—but she had such a high tolerance that she never threw up. I felt so lonely. I begged her countless times to stop, but she never did. I hated coming home from school. I remember sleeping a lot because I felt depressed. I just wanted peace, for things to go back to how they used to be.

It got so bad that my older brother, who was in the Air Force, offered to take me to live with him in Italy. But my mother refused. She wanted me to stay and live with her drinking. They both had redeemable moments, and when they were sober, I loved them—but the cycle of getting drunk and being nasty always came back.

I no longer have contact with my father. I do speak with my mother, and she comes to visit sometimes since she doesn’t have any kids at home anymore and likes to see her grandkids. She’s slowed down on drinking—not really by choice, but because she can no longer drive.

When she was here last time, she did pretty well at staying sober. But she still snuck alcohol from my husband. I came home from work and found her drunk in bed. Of course, she lied about it, but I know when she’s drunk. It made me so angry—how dare you drink in my home and bring back all this stress again?

I still love my mom, but it’s so hard to show it. I do nice things for her when she visits—buy her food, do her laundry, make her bed (well, mine), make her coffee, etc.—but when it comes to affection, I freeze up. Looking her in the eyes, hugging her, being close… it makes my skin crawl.

So what I’m asking is: does anyone else feel like this? Do you have a parent who’s made some changes and is better than they were, but you still can’t move on? You want to forgive, but the wall you built won’t come down?

Part of me wants to let go. But I’ve been let down so many times… how can I?",1,1760795489.0,Adulting,0,0.99,False

1o9waxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o9waxv/the_stain_on_the_wall/,The Stain on the Wall,"It all began when I learned to love.  
To love is to suffer.  
To love is to be stained with loneliness,  
with what you thought was more.  
To love is to always want more.

Have you ever lost so much?  
Have you ever lost so much that you don’t want to anymore?

And so, in the insatiable pain,  
the bottomless pit of darkness for a heart,  
there it appeared, on one of those nights—  
a tiny, yet all-consuming, stain on the wall.

What was it? How did it get there?  
 It wasn’t there last night.  
 I tried to clean it, though, but there wasn’t much use.  
 Whatever put it there was going to keep it—  
 in this cell of mine,  
 a room that kept me there, to watch it grow.

The morning can be so cold sometimes, you know,  
 and the sky so gray,  
 and the taste of coffee, so meaningless.

There was, however, time outside of it.  
 Some people find freedom by coming out of one prison only to enter another,  
 and so that was my case—my job.

To some, this job means lifting a box and putting down another;  
 to others, a distraction from something worse than lifting a box.  
 But what could be worse than spending every morning in this morgue  
 filled with walking corpses?

“How are you doing, Joe?” said the cashier.  
 “I manage to live.”  
 “You’ve got to let it go, Joe.”

Let it go...  
 What is there to let go?  
 Is there anything to hold on to?

Keys never fit at once—  
 stabbing the door of your own house,  
 of the place that waits impatiently  
 to lock you up.

I found myself once more in front of it.  
 “Did you grow?”  
 Of course it grew—there it was, eating your wall.  
 One can deal with a dirty wall;  
 for all I cared, it could fall apart.

But then, in the night  
It talked to me.

My mind was taken by pure terror,  
 and in that darkness, the ambiguity of every corner  
 formed all of my deepest fears.

It talked. It really did.  
That thing on my wall—it talked to me.

Like a mumble, weak and dry,  
 I couldn’t make it out.  
 And of course, I didn’t sleep all night.

Could it have been a bad dream?  
 But if so—why was it much bigger this morning?  
 And why did I miss the voice so much?

“A black stain on your wall? What of it?” she exclaimed, exhausted

  
 exhausted of me.

“It has been growing. I know it’s not a plumbing thing,  
 and it has this weird atmosphere when I get close and I—”

“Joe…”

“I think... I think it was calling me last night.”

“The stain, calling you...”

For the first time in years, I was happy to be back.  
 I wanted to hear it, I wanted to see it paint my whole world.  
 And there it was, this time, writhing and thick.  
 Whatever happened to my last wall, there was now a new one.

Dancing in the party of lights, leaving me alone with heavy breathing  
 and the thunderous lightning—the rain taking everything on its way.

“Look how much you’ve grown…”  
 Expanding and pulsating, a black pitch of sadness.

  
 And so it cracked, with that dry and sorrowful voice,  
 so needy of being heard:

*“I— I love you…”*

It was love that stained my wall

It was love what grows beyond, leaving me in the darkness

*“I love you so much, i love you so much…”*

The night ate my tongue

Is it fear that drives my silence? 

whatever i had in front of me, it started eating whatever it was left

*“Joe, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much…”*

whatever it was, it already ate me whole

and so it growed, a heavy tar that it destroyed all

a heavy tar that i used to love 

and so, love ate me whole.",1,1760795297.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Chips and chunks of paint missing with a particularly deep scratch on the drivers bumper, and shattered top coat in and around the area. I know that body repair on Mach E can be ridiculously costly, and I could never afford to get it fixed professionaly, so I did it myself.

Being ambitious and crafty, I got an Automotive Touch Up Spray can set, and over a long weekend and with a crazy amount of trial and error, I think did an acceptable job at repairing the entire lower bumper area. The color matches very well to the composite bumper material, although I've noticed the rapid red color on metal hood and fender has a more orangey tint that the cherry of the bumpers but that might be an age thing. There are some clear coat drips but I think it will suffice for winter, and I will work on it some more next year.

My process: cleaned and clay bared the area, wet sanded, filled with bondo, sanded again, primed, wet sanded, 4 coats of base, 2 coats of clear coat, wet sanding, 1 more clear coat, and a bit of polishing. Left it over the week to cure, and plan on polishing it up next.

Okay I have a 4yr old & a 8 week old. My 4yr old is at school throughout the week, and his biodad has him after school 3-4x a week while I get the other 3-4x. I thought I had motherhood down pat until my daughter was born. Oof...


My husband was talking to me this morning and I was telling him how I don't feel well and all of that. He asked if I drank or ate anything. Aparently not. I haven't ate anything but a piece of chicken thigh and a handful of strawberries in the last 2 days. I didn't realize it. And I've barely had any water. I've been taking sips of my husbands whenever it's close to me. It's Saturday and I still haven't washed my cup since Monday. So I know I've been neglecting my water intake too 

I've been so wrapped up with life I forgot myself. I've noticed when my 4yr old isn't home, I eat less because I'm not feeding him 3 meals & a thousand snacks all day. Hell I don't even cook for my husband when my son's not here 😂 it's because I just get lazy and I want to sleep as much as possible because ik as soon as he's home then it's running around in circles for hours. I'm chronically exhausted. 

I have the baby, and the 4yr old, and a task list longer than Cinderella. I have to deep clean my entire apartment by the end of this month I'm losing my mind. Not just deep clean - declutter because my landlord is trying to kick us out. Things that were never an issue are suddenly an issue. (We've lived here 4yrs now - example: the chain that came with the apartment not allowed aparently so they took that down that and a bunch of other complaints I gotta deal with now)

Not to mention - my 4yr old is feral. I mean literally would think he grew up alone in the wilderness. Bouncing off the walls. Toys everywhere, yelling (play or not)....and he is too hyper sometimes he'll forget and hurt his sister. He's already stepped on her head. 🤦🏻‍♀️ (I was changing her on the floor and BAM)

Idk how y'all are surviving. Especially if you have more than 1 - especially if it's 24/7. Or y'all with 2 under 2 😭 What coffee/energy drinks do y'all have. Because I'm losing it. And y'all with jobs?

1o9vvy0,https://i.redd.it/zgslmwzugvvf1.png,"Ten Years of Love, Sacrifice, and Dreams | Betrayal at Altar","I arranged the last white orchid in the crystal vase, my fingers lingering on its delicate petals. Three days until I became Mrs. Sterling. Three days until the culmination of ten years of love, sacrifice, and dreams. The flowers looked perfect against the cool marble of our dining table—elegant and pristine, just as Alexander preferred everything in our penthouse.

From the study came the low murmur of his voice, tense and hushed. Another business call, no doubt. The third one today that had required him to step away, to speak in tones too quiet for me to hear.

""Alexander?"" I called softly, unfolding the seating chart I'd spent hours perfecting. ""Do you think we should seat your cousin Richard next to my aunt Elena? I'm worried they might not—""

The study door swung open. Alexander stood framed in the doorway, his jaw tight, phone clutched in his hand. ""Just trust me to handle it, Isabella."" His voice cut through the air like ice. ""I don't have time for these trivial details right now.""

Before I could respond, he stepped back into the study and slammed the door. The orchids trembled in their vase.

I swallowed the familiar ache in my throat. He was stressed about work, that was all. The merger had been consuming him for months. Once we were married, things would be different. They had to be.

Hours later, I lit the last candle on our dining table, the flame casting a warm glow across the carefully arranged plates. Filet mignon—his favorite—rested under silver covers. I'd opened a bottle of sauvignon blanc, the one we'd discovered together in Napa Valley five years ago. A peace offering. A reminder of better days.

The elevator chimed. My heart quickened as I smoothed down my dress—the deep blue one he once said brought out my eyes.

""Alexander, I thought we could have our own private rehearsal dinner,"" I called, moving toward the foyer. ""Just the two of—""

The words died in my throat. It wasn't Alexander standing in our entryway. It was a woman—tall, blonde, and impossibly beautiful. Her face was pale, one manicured hand pressed against her stomach, the other braced against the wall.

""I'm so sorry to intrude,"" she said, her voice breathy and fragile. ""I... I just felt faint. The doorman knows me... he let me up.""

I stepped forward automatically, concern overriding confusion. ""Here, let me help you to the sofa.""

""That's very kind,"" she murmured, allowing me to take her arm. ""Alexander has told me how sweet you are.""

My hand froze on her elbow. ""You know Alexander?""

Her eyes—a calculated shade of vulnerability—met mine. ""I'm Charlotte. Charlotte Hayes. I work with Alex at Sterling Enterprises."" Her free hand drifted to her stomach in a protective gesture. ""The morning sickness has been terrible. The doctor says it's normal for the first trimester, but—""

The elevator chimed again. This time, Alexander's footsteps echoed across the marble floor. He froze when he saw us, his face draining of color.

""Charlotte?"" His voice was strangled. ""What are you doing here?""

""I'm sorry, Alex. I felt dizzy again. Your building was closest...""

Alexander's gaze darted between us, something dark and terrible building behind his eyes. When they settled on me, I didn't recognize the man staring back.

""What did you do?"" he hissed, advancing toward me.

""Nothing, I was just helping her to—""

His hand shot out, fingers closing around my throat with shocking force. ""What did you say to her? What did you do?""

""Alexander!"" Charlotte gasped. ""She was helping me. I felt faint from the baby—""

""The baby,"" he repeated, his grip tightening. ""And you, Isabella—were you being cruel to her? Jealous?""

I clawed at his hand, panic rising as my airway constricted. ""Alex—please—""

""She needs to rest,"" he snarled, shoving me backward. ""My child needs to rest!""

I stumbled, losing my balance at the top of the marble staircase. For one suspended moment, I saw everything with perfect clarity: the rage in Alexander's eyes, the flash of triumph in Charlotte's, the white orchids trembling in their vase.

Then I was falling.

My body tumbled down the unforgiving steps, each impact a new explosion of pain. I threw out my right hand instinctively to break my fall, and the sickening crack that followed echoed through the penthouse. White-hot agony shot up my arm as bone pierced skin, blood spraying across pristine marble.

Through a haze of pain, I saw Alexander scoop Charlotte into his arms, cradling her with a tenderness he'd never shown me. ""It's alright,"" he murmured to her. ""I've got you.""

They disappeared from view as darkness crept in from the edges of my vision. The last thing I saw was my own blood pooling beneath my shattered hand—the hand that had painted dreams, that had caressed his face for ten years, that had just finished arranging white orchids for a wedding that would never come.

Sirens wailed as my consciousness flickered in and out. Pain radiated from my shattered hand, each pulse sending fresh waves of agony through my body. Voices shouted around me as I was lifted onto something hard and flat. The ceiling of our penthouse—our beautiful, perfect prison—spun above me as strangers in uniforms rushed me toward the elevator.

""BP dropping! We need to move now!""

Through the haze, I caught glimpses of Alexander standing in the foyer, his face a mask of cold detachment as he watched the paramedics wheel me away. Charlotte clung to his arm, her face buried against his shoulder in a performance of distress.

""Sir, you should come with us,"" one of the paramedics called to him. ""She's lost a lot of blood.""

Alexander's jaw tightened. ""She's fine—get me back to Charlotte!""

He turned away from me, his hand protectively cradling Charlotte's waist as he guided her toward the door. ""My car's downstairs. We'll follow.""

The elevator doors closed, cutting off my view of the man I'd loved for ten years—the man who had just thrown me down a flight of stairs and was now more concerned about his mistress than whether I lived or died.

In the ambulance, I drifted in and out of consciousness as the paramedics worked frantically to stabilize me. My right hand was a mangled mess of bone and tissue. I tried to flex my fingers and screamed as white-hot pain shot up my arm.

""Don't move, honey,"" a gentle voice advised. ""That's a compound fracture. We're taking you to Mount Sinai. They've got the best hand surgeons in the city.""

Hand surgeons. The words echoed in my mind as tears leaked from the corners of my eyes. My painting hand. The one part of me that had remained truly mine during all these years with Alexander. The one connection to the girl I used to be—the art student with dreams bigger than becoming Mrs. Sterling.

The emergency room at Mount Sinai was a blur of harsh lights and urgent voices. I was whisked through corridors, an IV was inserted into my arm, and a kind-faced nurse with a name tag reading ""Sarah Jenkins"" leaned over me.

""We're going to take care of you,"" she promised, her eyes filled with a compassion that made me want to sob. ""The orthopedic surgeon is on his way.""

Then Alexander's voice cut through the chaos—sharp, demanding, and dangerous.

""Where is she? Where's my fiancée?""

Nurse Sarah straightened, her body language shifting as she moved to stand between my gurney and the approaching storm that was Alexander Sterling.

""Sir, you need to calm down. The patient is being prepped for surgery.""

""I don't care about the surgery,"" Alexander snarled, his expensive suit immaculate despite the blood that had sprayed across our marble floor. ""Charlotte needs blood. She's anemic—the pregnancy is taking a toll on her. Isabella can donate.""

I struggled to focus on his face, certain I had misheard. Surely even Alexander couldn't be this cruel.

""Sir,"" Sarah's voice hardened, ""your fiancée has lost a significant amount of blood herself. She's not in any condition to donate.""

""Do you know who I am?"" Alexander stepped closer, towering over the nurse. ""I'm Alexander Sterling. This hospital's west wing exists because of my family's donations. Now get me the head nurse before I have you fired.""

Sarah's face paled, but she stood her ground. ""This is against medical protocol—""

""Now!""

I watched through a haze of pain as Sarah reluctantly stepped away, returning moments later with an older woman in a more senior uniform. They spoke in hushed, urgent tones, but Alexander's influence was like a physical force, bending everyone around him to his will.

To my horror, a phlebotomist approached with blood collection equipment.

""I'm sorry,"" she whispered, unable to meet my eyes as she inserted a needle into my left arm. ""Just a small amount for testing compatibility.""

But I knew better. This wasn't about testing. This was Alexander taking from me one last time—my blood for the woman who had replaced me.

Through the observation window of the operating theater, I caught a final glimpse of Alexander before the anesthesia took hold. He stood with his arm around Charlotte, his fingers gently stroking her hair as he watched the surgical team prepare to piece together what remained of my shattered hand. His expression wasn't of concern or remorse—it was impatience, as if my surgery was an inconvenient delay in his day.

As darkness claimed me, one thought crystallized with perfect clarity: the man I had loved for ten years had never existed at all.

Hours later, I awaken to the beeping of machines and the sterile scent of antiseptic. My right hand is swathed in thick white bandages, the fingers peeking out like broken twigs. I try to lift it, but a searing pain shoots through my wrist, making me gasp.

“Don’t move,” a soft voice warns. “You’ve got hardware in there now. Pins and plates.”

I turn my head, wincing at the stiffness in my neck. Alexander stands in the doorway, his suit immaculate, his expression unreadable. Behind him, the city skyline glows through the window, a taunting reminder of the life I’ve been living.

“The doctor says you’ll need several transfusions,” he says, his tone devoid of emotion. “To help with recovery.”

Transfusions. For me. The thought brings a flicker of hope, but it’s quickly extinguished as he continues.

“Charlotte’s anemia is more pressing. Sign this.” He thrusts a clipboard at me, the pen rattling against the metal rail of the bed. “Consent form. Authorizing further transfusions.”

My blood runs cold. Not for me. For her.

“Alexander, I—”

“Just sign it, Isabella.” His impatience is palpable, his eyes already drifting toward the door. “We don’t have all night.”

I stare at the form, my hand trembling as I scribble my name. He snatches it back, barely glancing at my signature before striding out. The door clicks shut behind him, leaving me alone with the beeping monitors and my fractured thoughts.

Later, when the nurse comes to change my dressings, I catch a glimpse of the ruin beneath the bandages. My hand looks alien, the skin swollen and purple, the fingers twisted at unnatural angles.

“Will it…” My voice cracks. “Will it heal?”

The surgeon’s expression is grave. “We’ll do everything we can, but there’s a chance you may never regain full use of your hand. Especially…” He hesitates, then adds gently, “Especially for fine motor skills. Painting, for instance.”

The words hit me like a physical blow. My painting hand. The one thing that’s always been mine, the one thing Alexander couldn’t take. Tears burn my eyes, but I blink them back. I won’t cry. Not here. Not now.

Just then, Alexander’s phone buzzes in his pocket. He pulls it out, glances at the screen, and his jaw tightens. Without a word, he turns and walks out, leaving me staring at the empty doorway.

I’m still reeling when Charlotte appears, her presence as unwelcome as a storm cloud. She’s dressed in a flimsy hospital gown, her hair artfully disheveled, but her eyes are bright with a manic energy.

“Oh, Isabella,” she coos, her voice dripping with false concern. “I heard about your accident. How tragic.”

“It wasn’t an accident,” I say, my voice flat. “Your boyfriend pushed me.”

For a moment, her mask slips, and I see the calculating monster lurking beneath. Then she smiles, a cold, mirthless thing.

“Such a pity,” she says, sidling closer. “But you’ll survive. The important thing is that the baby’s healthy.”

I swallow hard, forcing myself to ask the question that’s been burning in my mind. “How is…the baby?”

Charlotte’s laughter is a brittle thing, like breaking glass. “There is no baby, Isabella. You’re just in our way.”

The words hit me like a slap. No baby. It was all a lie—a cruel, calculated manipulation. I open my mouth to respond, but no sound comes out.

Before I can gather my thoughts, Charlotte moves closer, a steaming cup of coffee in her hand. “I brought you something to drink,” she says, her voice sickly sweet. “You look like you could use it.”

I shrink back, but it’s too late. With a delicate flick of her wrist, she tips the cup, sending scalding liquid cascading over my bandaged hand. I scream, the pain excruciating as the hot coffee seeps into the wound.

“Oh dear,” Charlotte says, her eyes wide with mock horror. “How clumsy of me.”

I glare up at her, tears streaming down my face. “You did that on purpose.”

“Prove it,” she says, her voice dripping with triumph. “I’m just a fragile pregnant woman. You’re the one who’s always so…accident-prone.”

As she turns to leave, I catch a glimpse of Alexander in the doorway, his face a mask of fury. But it’s not directed at Charlotte—it’s directed at me.

1o9vsgf,https://v.redd.it/o1igvwvfgvvf1,Why Korean Bosses Love Latte?,"“라떼는 말이야“

This expression is one of the most popular Korean memes ever.
You’ll hear it in dramas, variety shows, and even real-life offices all the time. 

In Korea, when an older person starts a sentence with
“라떼는 말이야~ (Latte neun maliya~)”,
it sounds like “latte” (the coffee) —
but it actually comes from “나 때는 말이야,” which means “Back in my day…”

It’s a funny way older Koreans begin nostalgic or “lecture-style” stories,
like: “Back in my day, we worked late but had passion!” 

So this meme phrase became super popular 
because every Korean has heard it at least once from a teacher, a parent, or… a boss at work.

And here’s the fun part, 
sometimes even Koreans make visual jokes out of it! We use a horse (말 / ‘mal’) emoji drinking a latte to literally show “나 때는 말이야” (because in Korean, “mal” means horse,
and the phrase sounds like “latte is a horse”).
You might see memes in chatrooms showing a horse sipping a latte whenever someone acts old-fashioned or starts lecturing. 

In this short, our foreign rabbit character misunderstands “라떼” as the actual latte coffee, until she realizes the real meaning.
And ten years later… she becomes the “Latte Boss” herself ;)",2,1760794017.0,beezitkorea,0,1.0,False

1o9vri3,https://tipstor.io/how-predictive-ecosystem-modeling-is-changing-everything/,How Predictive Ecosystem Modeling Is Changing Everything,"The future isn’t waiting around for permission. It’s already here, pulsing through the veins of industries that once relied on gut instinct and spreadsheets, now guided by artificial intelligence mapping the lifeblood of entire ecosystems. Predictive Ecosystem Modeling isn’t a buzzword. It’s the next mutation in the evolution of business intelligence, and it’s moving faster than most boardrooms can comprehend.

Think of it as a living organism. Every product, customer, and supplier, every click, purchase, and cancellation, feeds a digital metabolism that never sleeps. According to McKinsey & Company, companies integrating ecosystem-level AI strategies are growing revenue up to 15% faster than those clinging to siloed data models. AI doesn’t just predict outcomes. It sees the invisible threads connecting them. It can anticipate how a shortage in Vietnamese coffee beans ripples into price adjustments for Parisian cafés, or how a spike in eco-conscious travelers alters hotel design strategy across three continents.

Lifecycle management techniques are the nervous system of this operation. Data doesn’t sit idle anymore. It breathes, learns, and adapts. AI filters the noise, detecting patterns that would take human analysts months to uncover. By modeling interactions across the entire product and customer lifecycle, businesses are shifting from reactive to preemptive. Gartner reports that by 2027, over 70% of large enterprises will use AI-driven lifecycle modeling to forecast demand fluctuations and optimize supply chain sustainability. That means fewer wasted resources, leaner operations, and higher profit margins.

The travel and hospitality sector is where this technology feels almost poetic. Marriott International has started using predictive AI to model global tourism ecosystems. Tracking weather patterns, political events, and consumer sentiment to determine pricing, promotions, and even room redesigns. Imagine a resort in Bali adjusting its staffing, menu, and inventory weeks before an influx of travelers arrives, all because an algorithm predicted a surge in Australian bookings following a currency shift. The system learns, evolves, and feeds its insights back into the loop, creating a perpetual cycle of optimization.

In Iceland, boutique tour operators are going further. Feeding AI models with environmental data, flight trends, and traveler social chatter to craft personalized journeys in real time. The algorithm doesn’t just recommend excursions. It reshapes the ecosystem around them, aligning operators, transport, and lodging into one synchronized experience. This isn’t guesswork. It’s precision built from prediction.

New trends are blooming from this digital soil. Quantum computing is beginning to accelerate predictive ecosystem modeling, allowing for real-time recalibration of entire business networks. AI-driven sustainability models are emerging, forecasting not only revenue potential but carbon footprints, guiding companies toward greener and more profitable decisions simultaneously. Deloitte’s recent global AI study shows that 82% of executives now see ecosystem modeling as key to achieving both profitability and environmental goals. A radical shift from just two years ago.

The result? Businesses that think like ecosystems, not hierarchies. Companies that no longer chase the market. They shape it. Predictive AI and lifecycle management aren’t tools anymore. They’re co-pilots in a world where speed, adaptability, and foresight mean survival. And for those still waiting to catch up. The ecosystem has already moved on without them.

But I need advice. So my awful ex (37m) and I (26f)just got out of a five year relationship. It ended because of an unplanned pregnancy.

For the past three months I’ve been looking for a place and finally found one. However, I’m stressed out because today I’m going to get my furniture. Some context: over the past four years we’ve gone through three coffee tables. The first two I purchased. He punched through both of these. A few months ago, we found one on the side of the road. It’s really nice, and we’ve been using that. A week ago I told him I was gonna take it as a heads up. Because I knew if I just took it without warning, he would be pissed. Since it’s only right since he punched through the first two. However, his response was to say “you didn’t buy shit.” And today he sent me a long paragraph about how he’ll be pursuing legal action if I take anything that’s not mine. Can I still take this coffee table? I tried to find the receipts for the first two coffee tables, but my target purchase history only goes back a year. But I did purchase both of them, I know for a fact because I was sober and he was not. I’m just scared He’s gonna try to come after me over this stupid coffee table. But I don’t think it’s fair. I have to buy a new one, when he ruined the first two that I did buy. So I guess the question is, can I take it without worrying about any legal action?",1,1760793728.0,NoStupidQuestions,2,1.0,False

1o9vnym,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o9vnym,A short break and a look-see!,"We decided on the spur of the moment a few months ago to have a 4 night holiday in Iceland, focusing on Reykjavik. We are Aussies living in NYC and the delight of being able to be in Iceland - Iceland! - in less than 6 hours is still amazing to us. 

As we planned and I used this sub, I realised that only seeing Reykjavik was not going to be enough. So we took advice and hired a car for 3 of those days. 

Taking more advice, we decided against the Golden Circle and instead had a day in the north and a day on the south coast. These places have been written up extensively so I have really nothing to add that hasn’t been said already other than that having only one driver (I’m not confident on the right hand side) was tiring for these trips. But still worth it! 

I wanted to talk about Reykjavik a bit because it is undersold IMO. I loved it as a really cool, chill city (feeling more like a country town) with a sassy vibe. Yes it’s touristy (the locals are immediately visible by walking around in normal clothes and not full hiking gear head to toe lol) but the art and the design in a minimalist, NFG way is cool. 

We love to eat and drink in every city we travel to and Reykjavik was outstanding for this. Much better than, say, Helsinki and Stockholm where we went a few months ago. This surprised me. 

We weren’t up for spending the major dollars at somewhere like OX but we nevertheless ate very well at Skal, Mat Bar, Sumac and Reykjavik Kitchen. My aim was to mix up things and have a broad taste of eating out and I think I succeeded. There’s still another 5-6 places at least on my long list! The fish and the lamb was outstanding everywhere. 

Yes food and drinks are expensive. We live in NYC and so didn’t get sticker shock but we spent on average between $70 and $140 USD per head on food (with usually one glass of wine each).

We love, love, loved two wine bars in particular. The first was Vinstukan Tiu Sopar - no wine list, you tell them what you like and they find something that fits the bill, such fun! - and also Port 9, which was initially a bit hard to find but such a lovely space and excellent wines by the glass. 

We had excellent coffee at Reykjavik Roasters (no syrups, no decaf! lol) and a lovely breakfast at Sandholt but I thought the cinnamon buns at Braud and Co were a bit meh. (No accounting for personal taste!) 

A final word on the hot springs. We chose Sky Lagoon and Hvammsvik based on what this sub recommends. We LOVED Sky Lagoon which actually surprised me a bit. It’s just so well organised and relaxing. It wasn’t crowded (in mid October) and you could have peace and your own space. Well worth the money.  A great thing to do on the first afternoon. 

We went to H a few days later. While the setting is STUNNING unfortunately it’s more vulnerable to being dominated by loud people because the pools are all small. On the day we went there were two groups in separate pools who were yammering about ‘back home’ to obviously new friends and it really spoiled the experience that should have been serene. I know this sounds like a bit of a Karen rant but some signs encouraging people to be aware of others and speak quietly would enhance the whole thing. 

My phone is VERY old but Iceland is so gorgeous that it couldn’t help but take good photos! 

We will definitely be back - a short trip in the middle of winter to eat more food and wander Reykjavik in the snow, and then a longer one in probably 18 months where we will do the ring road in Spring. I can’t wait!

Day 20 - kins in a coffee shop (nvm it got deleted)

Now uh, so my friend (who doesn’t know I’m a fictionkin) and I were going through saved videos, and I came across one of me and my f/o and showed it to them, she mistook me for Moon and said Monty x Moon is a horrible ship, so I clarified it was me (ruin) not Moon, and she said, I still don’t think a Moon-like animatronic should be with Monty.

I don’t really want to make a big deal of it, but it kinda hurt, any advice?

Do you simply use different titles for the show. For example (not the real names)

I don’t know how much time I’ve spent in this facility. The clocks don’t move here — or maybe they do, but every time I look at one, the second hand is exactly where I remember it last.

They told me I was brought here on a government fellowship — a research internship for psychology graduates. “Behavioral Observation,” the letter said. Paid housing, secure clearance, and direct work with a classified subject.

At the time, I thought I’d hit the jackpot.

Now I can’t tell if I’m still working here… or being kept here.


The first day felt almost cinematic. A man in a dark coat met me at the train station, no name tag, just a badge with the U.S. crest and an ID number. He said he worked for “Division E.” When I asked what that was, he said, “Exactly.”

We drove for hours into the woods until the signal on my phone died. The facility looked like a hospital that didn’t want to admit it was one — white walls, endless corridors, security cameras in every corner.

The doctor who greeted me — Dr. Halvorsen — was pale and polite, but there was something rehearsed in his tone.

“You’ll be monitoring Subject 63-B,” he said. “You’re here to observe, record, and report behavioral anomalies. You are not to speak with the subject.”

“Anomalies?” I asked.

He smiled faintly. “You’ll understand soon.”



They took me to a narrow room with glass on one side — like a one-way mirror. On the other side sat the “subject.”

A man, maybe mid-20s. Plain hospital clothes. Staring blankly at the wall.

There was something familiar about him that I couldn’t place. Not a memory exactly — more like déjà vu, that itch you get in your brain when something feels almost remembered.

Every few minutes he’d twitch slightly, like his mind had tripped over something. His reflection in the glass didn’t always match his movement perfectly, but I blamed the lighting.

I sat there for eight hours, taking notes. He never said a word.

That night, I dreamed I was sitting in the same chair, but from his side of the glass.



Over the next few days, I kept noticing strange details.

Every door in the facility required a keycard swipe — except the observation wing. The lock lights there were always green, as if someone had permanently authorized entry.

My ID badge didn’t have my photo on it. Just INTERN – TEMP CLEARANCE.

And the subject, 63-B, kept looking at the mirror. Not randomly — directly at me.

I thought it was a coincidence until the fourth day. I shifted my chair back to stretch, and at that exact moment, he tilted his head, mimicking the movement perfectly.

It wasn’t delayed. It was simultaneous.

I reported it to Dr. Halvorsen.

He wrote something down and asked, “Do you think the subject might be mirroring you?”

“Yes,” I said. “Almost like he can see me.”

Halvorsen smiled politely. “He can’t. It’s one-way glass.”

Then he leaned forward slightly and added, “Unless, of course, you’re on the wrong side of it.”

He laughed softly. I didn’t.



That night, I woke up to the sound of someone whispering in the hallway outside my room. The lights were dim, and the voices were muffled, but I caught bits of conversation:

> “…still believes he’s staff…”
“…loop reset if he starts remembering…”
“…we’ll try the mirror test again tomorrow.”



When I stepped into the hallway, it was empty.

I told myself I was just overtired. But I couldn’t sleep again after that.



Day seven, I found something odd in the observation notes binder.

It wasn’t my handwriting, but the style looked like mine — same slanted letters, same messy loops.
The log was dated April 14.
That would’ve been fine… if it weren’t March.

The entry read:

> “Subject 63-B displayed repetitive memory fragment. Claims to be ‘an intern psychologist’ brought in for observation work. Possible identity delusion triggered by mirror conditioning.”



Underneath that, someone had scribbled: “Erase cycle — retain baseline personality.”

I flipped through more pages. Every week had an entry describing the subject regaining parts of his memory, followed by “reset successful.”

The problem was — every description matched me.



I went to confront Dr. Halvorsen. He wasn’t in his office. No one was.
The lab corridors were deserted, every light buzzing faintly.

I finally found him in the observation room, standing exactly where I usually sit, staring through the glass.

At first, I thought he was watching Subject 63-B.

Then I realized the other side of the glass was empty.

“Where’s the patient?” I asked.

He turned slowly toward me. “Which one?”

I felt something cold crawl down my spine.

“You said I was assigned to monitor him.”

Halvorsen studied me for a moment. “And you’ve done well. But we’ve noticed… contamination.”

“What contamination?”

He didn’t answer — just motioned toward the glass.

I stepped forward.

And saw my own reflection blink… half a second too late.



The next thing I remember, I was in my room with restraints on my wrists. The air smelled of alcohol wipes and static.

Dr. Halvorsen was sitting beside the bed, holding a clipboard.

“You had a break,” he said softly. “You wandered into restricted areas. Do you remember that?”

I tried to speak, but my throat was dry. “Where’s Subject 63-B?”

He smiled faintly. “You are, Daniel.”

My heart stopped. “What?”

“You’ve been here for fourteen months. You’re part of a behavioral conditioning experiment. The intern identity was introduced to measure cognitive resistance.”

“That’s not true,” I said. “You hired me. You sent me letters, contracts—”

“We did. And we’ll do it again, once the reset completes.”

He stood up, adjusted something on a monitor, and said, “You’ve reached awareness before, but it never lasts. Don’t worry. This time we’ll record everything.”

He walked out before I could reply.



I stayed restrained for what felt like days. They injected something every few hours — not enough to knock me out, but enough to blur everything.

Every time I started to drift, I’d hear faint voices through the walls, overlapping like a broken recording:

> “Loop initiated.”
“Intern simulation protocol.”
“Subject stable.”



Sometimes I saw flashes — bright rooms, people in white coats, myself screaming into a mirror.

And sometimes, I saw that same one-way glass again, except I was on both sides.

Watching.
And being watched.



Eventually, they removed the restraints. Halvorsen came in smiling, holding a clipboard again.

“How are we feeling today, Daniel?”

“Fine,” I said. I’d learned not to resist.

“Good. Let’s begin again.”

He motioned toward the door, and two guards escorted me down the corridor.

They opened a door — my observation room.

Except now, on the other side of the glass, there was someone sitting in the chair.

A man in plain hospital clothes. Early twenties. Pale. Blank expression.

He looked exactly like me.

Halvorsen placed a notepad in my hands. “Observe him carefully. Record everything you notice. Do not attempt to communicate.”

I wanted to scream. But I didn’t.

I just sat down and started taking notes.

Because somehow… it felt familiar.



Over the following days, I noticed patterns — the subject would twitch when I did, shift when I did, blink slightly off-time.

I asked Halvorsen once why his movements matched mine so closely.

He smiled. “That’s the point. You’re observing cognitive mirroring. He’s learning from you.”

But one night, when I leaned forward, he leaned forward first.

I froze.

He mouthed something through the glass.

I couldn’t hear it clearly, but it looked like: “Wake up.”



That night, I dreamt of my old apartment — the one I left when I got this job.
There were moving boxes still unpacked, my coffee mug on the counter.
I looked out the window — same city skyline, same morning fog.

Then the lights flickered, and suddenly the reflection in the window wasn’t mine.

It was the man from the other side of the glass, staring back at me.

I woke up screaming.

Halvorsen and two guards rushed in. “He’s fragmenting again,” the doctor said. “Administer the sedative.”

As they pinned me down, I managed to shout, “I’m not the subject! I’m the intern!”

Halvorsen leaned close, expression calm. “And that’s exactly what he said last cycle.”



I don’t remember blacking out. But when I woke up again, I was in a different room.
No restraints. Just a desk, a chair, a mirror.

A speaker on the wall crackled.

“Welcome back, Daniel. Observation phase starting now.”

I stood up, approached the mirror — and realized it wasn’t reflecting my movements.

The person on the other side stared at me, confused, terrified.
He looked just like me, but his ID badge said: INTERN – TEMP CLEARANCE.

He mouthed something I couldn’t hear. Then his expression changed — realization, horror.

He mouthed it again, slower this time.

“They hired me to watch a patient. They never said it was me.”

The intercom buzzed softly behind me.

Halvorsen’s voice, calm and professional:

> “Excellent. Recognition achieved. Begin next cycle.”



The lights flickered.
The second hand on the clock froze.

1o9vj15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1o9vj15/seeking_advice_could_this_behavior_be_grounds_for/,Seeking Advice: Could This Behavior Be Grounds for a Marriage Annulment?,"We got married four months ago. Before our marriage, my husband lived and worked in another city. He often said that he wanted to build our life together there and that this would be our home. He even changed his residence to that city, which made me believe he was serious about starting our life together. Based on his words, I began preparing everything for our new home.

The apartment we were supposed to live in is not in our ownership; my father gave it to us to live in. I personally took care of everything — painting the walls, installing new electricity, buying and setting up the washing machine, couch, furniture, dishes, and everything else needed for a home. I hired workers, paid for all the expenses, and invested both my money and effort. He did not participate financially or physically in any of this.

Shortly after the wedding, problems began with his family, especially his mother, who from the start had a negative attitude toward me. She made hurtful comments such as:
	•	“My son used to like more dressed-up women.”
	•	“It will be tough for him with you, you’re not like us.”
And right after the wedding, she even said in front of others:
	•	“I’m not giving my baby to anyone.”

These comments clearly showed that she was not ready to let her son live independently or accept our marriage.

After the wedding, my husband did not have a job. He had quit his previous job shortly before the wedding, saying he would “look for a new one afterward,” but that never happened. Instead of actively seeking work in our city and helping us start our life together, he went back to live with his parents for “a few days,” which turned into staying there permanently.

During the time we spent at his parents’ home after the wedding, his mother constantly called him to go out with her — for coffee or shopping — while leaving me alone at home. He never stood up for me or showed understanding for how excluded and disrespected I felt.

We briefly went on a two-day honeymoon. The first night was fine, but the next day his brother arrived unexpectedly, saying he would stay with us “so he wouldn’t have to pay for accommodation.” He ended up sleeping in the same small hotel room with us, which completely destroyed any sense of intimacy and respect.

After that, we traveled abroad to visit one of his friends for several days, but due to tension between that couple, he couldn’t stay there long. Soon after returning home, he decided once again to leave — this time to his parents’ home, saying he would go “for five days to learn a new skill.” Those five days turned into a permanent move.

At first, he told me he would come back, that he would return for good and continue our life together. But very soon, his words changed. He started saying that he “could not live away from his family,” and that “if I wanted to stay married, I had to move there with him.”

I tried to find a compromise. I suggested we live somewhere neutral, even in another country, but every idea I offered he rejected or made fun of. He said things like:
	•	“We will never live together again because you want one thing, and I want another.”
	•	“I’m angry at myself for not seeing what you’re really like before I married you.”

Meanwhile, his parents started calling both me and my father, saying things such as:
	•	“If you want to save your marriage, you must move here.”
	•	“We’ll pay for everything — rent, bills, all expenses — if you come.”

This clearly showed that he was not making decisions independently, but that his parents were heavily influencing our marriage.

Financially, he was very irresponsible. The first salary he ever received he spent entirely on car seats. Later, he bought a motorbike worth around 20,000 euros without even telling me; I only found out about it three weeks later. He eventually said he canceled the purchase, but the fact that he made such a decision without me shows that he did not see our marriage as a partnership.

I tried to help him find work — searching for job openings, contacting employers, even finding a job that suited his skills — but he never followed through. Then he decided he wanted to become a tattoo artist because “it pays well.” He took 200 euros for a course he never attended. Later, he said he wanted to learn another trade and left for his hometown to do so — where he eventually decided to stay permanently.

I even attended workshops on self-employment, learned about business registration and grants, and looked into all possible ways to support him in starting a business. He showed no genuine interest or commitment.

Over time, his messages revealed more of his thinking. He wrote things like:

“This isn’t about going back home. This is where my real home is. I went there for you, to make it easier for us not to live with my parents. But you have to understand — I’m from here, I was born here.”
“My parents are not above our marriage, but in my family there’s enough bread that it would be shameful to look for it somewhere else.”
“You will come here to me.”

These words made it clear that he never truly accepted the idea of a shared, independent married life.

In social situations, he often acted immature and inconsiderate. At the wedding of our mutual friend (who was also our witness), instead of being supportive, he made scenes and mocked the event:

“I’m never going to another wedding again.”
“Why did you bring me here? This is awful.”
“This is so boring.”
That entire day, instead of enjoying our time together, I was emotionally drained and ended up crying for most of the evening.",1,1760793346.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

It's an incredibly common pull, this cycle of expectation and delayed gratification, where we believe 'making the best' requires grand circumstances or perfect conditions.  
  
But here's the powerful truth: making the best out of life isn't about a destination or external factors at all. It's an internal art form—a conscious choice to engage with your \*present\* reality, find meaning in the mundane, and discover growth in every single challenge. It’s about cultivating an appreciative mindset that transforms ordinary moments into extraordinary experiences through intentionality and gratitude.  
  
Today, I challenge you to try something simple: choose one small, everyday task—like drinking your morning coffee, taking a brief walk, or even doing a chore. Engage with it completely. Notice every detail, every sensation, every nuance, and find one specific thing you can genuinely appreciate about it.

Caffeine is unique and widely misunderstood. 

To use it properly it makes sense to understand how it works.

Caffeine energizes the bodys metabolism directly which increases the metabolic rate. The increased metabolic rate needs to be matched with adequate metabolic support. **The common symptom of feeling anxious or shaky after coffee is from a lack of support**, which causes **low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)**.

>Low blood sugar causes a stress response which releases adrenaline, the stimulant behind the fight-or-flight response and anxiety itself.

To prevent this from happening when drinking coffee, the solution is to provide adequate metabolic support (*glucose*) to maintain a stable blood sugar level. This entirely avoids the stress response... no adrenaline, no shakes, no anxiety, no crash.

**When you do coffee the right way expect calmness, focus, motivation, warmth, and stable energy.**

Using coffee properly might also mean drinking a quarter (or less) of a cup (with optional milk) instead of a full cup and **never drinking coffee first thing in the morning**.

Another strategy involves a common supplement called theanine. It pairs very well with caffeine because it entirely stops the stress response. This makes theanine a powerful anti-anxiety tool for daytime use and improving sleep quality.",1,1760792633.0,u_Breizh333,0,1.0,False

After that he constantly was saying that he wanted to get graped by multiple men and be left in the road to die everyday while we were in uni. It was then that I decided to talk to our mutual friend (since she didn't know the extent of how seriously bad he was), we agreed to do an intervention for him. He was dismissive,playing it off like he didn't really wanted to do it and that he was always joking, he kinda agreed to go to a psychiatrist for help. Next day comes, we hang out, he says that he'll maybe go in the fall( never did) and that we are too dramatic for doing an intervention on him. The calls continue, with his therapist lacking of helping him feel safe to speak about certain heavy topics,he talked them out with me. I became his second therapist. I finally blew up, couldn't take it any longer and talked to our friend , she said have boundaries. After that she became kinda aggressive towards him at out vacations, and when I had a physical bad reaction to his constant air conditioning all night, she grew more angry towards him. I then days later went on vacations alone ,stopped answering him. It was then that everything shifted. She ,since then grew colder towards me and he ,since I put boundaries and said you can no longer call me , is being weird. He says weird derogatory comments like, I'm a queen you're a servant, I'm a diamond you're onyx,he still cuts me off when I speak to other people or even teatchers and speaks for me. I don't know what to do, how to move forward. This friendship made me very closed off to other people, they found many flaws to almost every boy that I had a relationship. I feel brainwashed.

I’ve just had an absolutely terrible experience while traveling to a small town in France & was wondering if anyone would mind taking a peek at the relocated transit charts for me & my boyfriend? 

Yesterday morning both of our computers were stolen, and also a little money pouch with about €30. Money wasn’t important but it was a sentimental pouch from my BFF.

Then after fights with the hotel staff (who took our computers but denied) and meeting with the police, we go to get some coffee and the waiter dropped his entire tray of coffee on me, spilling coffee & breaking the glasses!

As if that wasn’t enough, after leaving France and arriving into Spain for the night my beloved pendulum broke 😢 

I’m a bit out of sorts, so if sharing a completely different chart is more helpful I can pull them, it’s just much more tedious to pull from my phone vs. laptop & I wasn’t sure which would be most helpful. 

Thanks in advance! I’m a beginner with astrocartography and once I have a computer again I definitely want to go back and scour our charts for this day, but am hoping for a little information in the meantime if anything sticks out.

Sauce Pot – I absolutely love this one! It works well on any type of stove and is made of stainless steel. Just be a bit careful when frying, food can easily burn on the outside while staying raw inside (learned that the hard way with fried chicken!). If you plan to fry chicken, I recommend scoring it first before cooking.

Frozen Vegetables – A great find! The carrots still taste naturally sweet, and the broccoli and cauliflower stay nice and crunchy. Just don’t overcook them.

Kopi Juan Choco Coffee – Affordable and satisfying! It’s a good pick-me-up that delivers on flavor.

Choco Alps Chocolate Bar – Personally, I find this one even better than Goya. Definitely worth a try.

Make it make sense, please.

**My questions are:**

*a)* Is it too early in general?

*b)* is 28 years old, too late/early, in this day in age? Could she have another 2 or 3 years?

*c)* How likely could the relationship still be in the veil of limerance or the honeymoon phase *(can last between 3 months to 3 years). I* say 70/30. 30 percent, they could be in the honeymoon phase.

**A little background**

For a good year or so before they met, i could see her developing that 'baby fever' stage that some us women get, I haven't yet anyway so help on this would be much appreciated. She even alluded, albeit jokingly, to having kids to another guy that she had a thing for, just before the current boyfriend.

They seem in love, they hit it off from the get go, a coffee shop in the heart of Michigan. He basically moved in with her, and her family, after only like 4 months, while his family home is not that far away.

From all the years I known her, great friend, introvert and loving at heart, but towards men, rather men she is attracted to, her personality is a strange one, she at times can latch on, flirt with guys, they catch feelings and then she throws them to the kirb.

I have seen it happen, and believe it or not, continued to flirt with him when her and her current bf were starting out. Although I was kinda a matchmaker, knowing she liked him, and he was heartbroken hearing she met another guy. I felt a little responsible, not going to lie.

I am also thinking about the baby.

Financial stability should be a factor for the sake of the baby. Both have sub-par jobs, nothing substantial, but since they live with their families and they are close by, rent and babysitting are not a factor.

**Bonus question:**

Do you think she subconsciously manipulated him into having a baby? Was he so head over heels for her that only after a year, he didn't even consider waiting?

Any information would be great, as I can at least, for myself, learn from it with my own boyfriend of 2 years.

Maybe I am projecting as I am the same age and I was thinking, should me and my boyfriend start to think about having kids soon.

My interest in this topic is more of a general, broad interest, using my friend as a case study on the psychology of it.",0,1760791105.0,pregnant,5,0.5,False

I have been spending some time single and learning self-care and it dawned on me after a trip to the PNW recently. I'm lonely and the reasons aren't because I want\* to be sad or that I'm seeking to inflict it on myself. I just want to share experiences and life with my partner and become a part of a team again, and part of that requires the effort on my part to seek out those interested in effort and care as well. I've been on dating apps, done casual dating in the past, responsibly and respectfully, and had my fun while maintaining my care for people and myself. So, now it's time to find someone serious about creating a relationship with effort and care for each other. Dating apps get too quick to fostering avoidance, self promotion of services or content, bots, and people not serious about the work to build something with others but it's also very accessible and fits most molds for people so I don't knock anybody for trying it! It's just not built for what I want right now and it's time to reach out and share the care I know everybody wants to find my person out there, where ever they find themselves. 

  
I am looking for a monogamous relationship with a woman (Age probably between 27-33) who is serious about communicating and developing it together. I think it's more about their spirit and personality that I'm mostly interested in that just comes with time. I am not trying to instantly hop into anything and am willing and patient for a slower pace and learning about each other. I've done long distance before but I don't really think that's my bag right now but I'm open to trying for the right person who is good at communicating, moving for each other I don't think is completely out of the question either but again, I would prefer to be within visiting distance of each other. 

  
More about me loosely: (Rest can be discovered through chatting and exploring our further interests together, shared or not or in your message)

\-I am a 31 (32 this month) Cis Male 6' 1"" dad bod + (240 lbs last I checked for those that care) and have been told I'm conventionally attractive (but I think I'm just a nerd who's average and confident in interactions generally and care about peoples' story) We can swap pictures when we both are more comfortable. 

\-I am an ambivert, I can be out and about and socialize but I do have a battery and get to a point where I need to fill my cup at home or with my close circle of friends who I love dearly. Have a lot of fun staying in and don't mind changes of scenery every once in a while

\-Love language is Physical Touch/Acts of Service and I'm not sure what most people would be interested in outside of this so feel free to ask 

\-I have two large dogs that I care and love beyond measure but you gotta earn the puppy pictures I'm sorry/not sorry. I gotta protect them like they protect me <3

\-I work in Tech and have been navigating and enjoying niches in this for the past 6 almost 7 years 

\-My current schedule is overnight and I tend to be a night owl but regularly shift my schedule around on my days off for seeing my friends and activities/events

\-I love pretty much all music and like appreciating any aspect of it, from just vibes to chatting music theory in its composition ( I played a few\* instruments and am picking them back up lately so talk music to me if you also love it!) and my favorite genres are Metal, Rock, Blues, Hip hop, and we'll leave it at 4 for now cause there are too many and we can share playlists if interested. Recently been tearing up Sleep Token, Beartooth, and Cane Hill 

\-Sensitive topics that many care about (understandably) Politically I lean pretty left and am just more interested in people who also believe in doing what makes them happy without hurting anyone else. Nothing complicated just care about people where applicable and to a reasonable amount based on relation. Religion: I'm more spiritual and don't practice any formal/organized religion. so not so much ""religious"" in the traditional definition and not interested in preaching at anyone or telling them how they ""need"" to live. 

\- Hobbies: I like playing video games, Listening/playing music, walking/playing with my pups, Coffee/Tea the prep is pretty meditative, Hiking, being in nature and picking up what I can in general from others. The more forested the better. I love cooking and am constantly trying new cuisines to make at home, I like to read and engage in creative writing when I can, I also play Tabletop games; Board games, Dungeons and Dragons, and card games, Love Space and can lose A LOT of time with NASA or any aerospace content/articles, I also like to go on drives and discover new places near me, other hobbies exist but I'm Yapping :P

\-I do not smoke anything and am not interested in it personally (Gives me migraines sorry! I've met lovely people who do and have some friends that do so I don't mind others doing it but just can't be around it a lot) and I rarely drink, not really crazy about it is all. 

If you've read this far then go ahead and shoot me a message and tell me about yourself if you are interested! And for authenticity answer this question for me, It might come up in a board game I have for us to play. What lesson took you the longest to unlearn? ",1,1760790990.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1o9uls1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o9uls1,Review on Seouls' Restaurant (Ajoynagar),"My elder sister and me decided to do a ""side quest"" today. 

It was lunchtime, the weather was pleasant, the scooty ride was more or less smooth and before we knew it we took a right turn from the Ajoynagar - Bypass area and landed at the gate of a giant resturant cum cafe called Seouls Resturant. 

We entered, a South Korean lady greeted us and I asked is it Seouls Kitchen ? She smiled and gently corrected my pronunciation saying its ""Saa-ool's Resturant"" and asked us to go upstairs as the first floor was the bakery cum cafe area. 

We ascended a wide staircase leading into a spacious resturant where young couples seemed to be the dominant species. We sat down, picked up the menu and tried to decide what to order. 

As it was our first baby step into korean cuisine, we could not understand which dish to order and took to scouring reddit for suggestions. Reddit came up with a coffee suggestion (my sis loves coffee) - Einspanner which I renamed as Eienstein's coffee cuz the real name wasn't memorable enough (huh 💅 my life my rules) , a chicken dish darkgangjeong and a noodle dish japchae. The coffee and the chicken was a superb pair 100/10 (so good we ordered one more cup of coffee lol .. just make sure to mix it well ). Japchae noodles had a slippery, jelly like texture which felt quite nasty in the mouth at the beginning but eventually tasted good once we got used to it so it's a 6/10. 

At the end we took home a tiramisu cake and custard pie from the bakery and the bill came to be Rs. 2220 which was on the expensive end. However, the experience of authetic korean food, quick service and Eienstein's coffee uffffff was worth it in my opinion. 

So, do check out this food joint if you live here at least once !

1o9uh4g,https://substack.com/home/post/p-175845337,The Burden of Proof: Inside the Presidency That Put AI on the Bench,"What if the efficiency and accuracy of AI flipped the judicial system--and you were presumed guilty until you could prove yourself innocent?

\-----

Ward's first impression was sound: courthouse fluorescents bickering with the chants outside, both at the same needling pitch. Security lines snaked past screens looping the President's inaugural address—throatier now, riding its own echo. ""Fairness through automation,"" he promised, teeth bared beneath a ticker: TODAY'S DOCKET, ADJUDICATED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNSELONE™.

The rhythm of ""Hands off the jury"" filled the blanks under Ward's ribs.

They'd changed the entry process since his last appearance—no shoes-off or pat-downs, just a biometric archway scanning posture and gait, matching faces to legal history. When he stepped through, the arch pulsed, as if diagnosing his marrow.

Beyond, the lobby gleamed with budget-hotel optimism. Benches held defense teams in rented suits and women with earpieces and legal pads. Halfway down the corridor, a kiosk flared to life—WELCOME ELIAS WARD, IT'S TIME TO PREPARE. The panel pulsed, spinning a faceless manacled avatar.

""Would you like to rehearse remorse?"" asked the CounselOne wizard in a half-whispered calm, each syllable presidential yet algorithmically neutral.

He tapped ""SKIP"" with a thumbnail.

The kiosk displayed today's proceedings with a gold seal: ""As seen on National Leadership Forum."" Ward recognized the President's campaign font—heavy slab serifs, like a threat translated into punctuation.

The hallway reeked of recycled air and burnt coffee. A bailiff checked his ID without eye contact, then led him past a mural stenciled with ""Bias ends here."" Behind it, pixelated figures linked arms in a unity line—all races composited into one interchangeable mass.

The prep room opened before him, walls lined with acoustic foam and CounselOne-watermarked etiquette posters. A camera tracked his entry with pulsing blue light. Ward sat at the plastic table, avoiding the embedded black rectangle. The specs were clear—eye tracking, posture monitoring, live dashboard feed. Every gesture: flagged, scored, archived.

News clips cycled on the wall. Last year's mayor in handcuffs: CORRUPTION. Then with family: MORAL CLARITY MATTERS. Ward's own face flickered from a Senate hearing, smile brittle as he testified.

Chyron: ""Ward: The President Must Answer.""

Gone instantly, leaving an afterimage.

Dana ducked in. ""Prelim's in seventy seconds."" Hair in a tight bun, eyes wary like a nurse with a high-risk patient. He recognized her—a technician who'd survived three purges by knowing when to stay silent.

""CounselOne requests your attention,"" chimed the interface.

Dana grimaced. ""They're pulling feeds from all three rooms. Full integration.""

The phrase meant something. Nothing unmonitored, not even a cough.

Ward thumbed a restless pattern on the table's edge. US V. ELIAS WARD—PRELIMINARY HEARING, COUNSELONE v4.1. Below that: ""As per EO 4871, all objections will be reviewed for reasonableness and public confidence impact."" The phrase still crawled along his scalp after three readings. As if justice now hinged on Facebook polls and donor listservs.

Courtroom 3B chilled him to the bone.

Half the gallery benches were marked with blue tape. Reporters hunched over tablets, styluses tapping in unison, while two men in navy windbreakers watched from the back—unmarked, ambiguously credentialed observers of the new order.

Judge Harper sat at the bench, hair sheared close, lips compressed flat as a logic gate. The Bias-Mitigation Monitor—a rotating lens at her left—flashed green as she logged in. Ward mapped the room quickly: camera angles, display surfaces, the prosecutor's seat with white folders labeled ""EXHIBIT: LANG.""

Ava Lang entered briskly, the President's designated firewall. Her face had the engineered trustworthiness of public health posters. She took her seat, conferred with the terminal, and looked through Ward like he was already a memory.

""TruthSync's running hot,"" Dana whispered. ""They already have your pre-brief. And your interviews.""

Ward nodded, hands flat against the cold table that seemed designed to draw off warmth. The CounselOne display already showed ""Projected Case Disposition: 86.3%""—pulsing orange before proceedings had even begun.

A chime sounded, shrill and final.

""This court will now come to order,"" intoned a voice too resonant for the small room. Ward glanced up. Judge Harper's eyes flicked past him—to the Bias-Mitigation Monitor, then to the timestamp on her bench: 8:01:31. An extra second—warning or grace note, he wondered.

Ava Lang spoke first, syllables clipped. ""Your Honor, under Executive Order 4871, the People move for immediate review of pretrial disposition based on the defendant's risk profile and history of institutional defiance.""

She never looked at Ward.

Judge Harper nodded. ""Submission received. CounselOne, summarize the defense position.""

The table's interface vibrated. Above the screen, a miniature Ward materialized, lips perfectly synced to a hollow, cadence-stripped version of his objection: risk does not equal guilt, and excluding live witness testimony violates protocol. The live transcript scrolled, color-coded: Reasonableness LOW; Confidence Impact AMBER. A pulsing icon warned ""combative in tone.""

He clenched his jaw.

Ava's tablet displayed past ""combative"" flags—Ward pressing a senator, grilling a CEO, challenging a committee chair—each clip damning him for refusing to fall silent.

Harper's voice cut in: ""Objection noted. CounselOne, display the objector's pattern of defiance.""

A split-screen: a younger Ward, sharper-jawed, eyes clear. The AI's highlight reel marched through dates, ""public confidence risk"" scores ticking downward as he aged.

Ava invoked TruthSync, the DOJ's transparency tool. On the screen emails, calendar entries, call logs flickered—each moment his recollection deviated from ""established truth"" by over two percent, gaps glowing like infected tissue. Ward's hands curled under the table; Dana remained motionless behind him.

Ava's questions landed with engineered precision. ""Mr. Ward, why does your recollection contradict the public record of the October 17 meeting with Senator Grant?""

Pre-populated responses appeared, color-coded by ""plausibility."" He selected none, letting silence stretch until Harper's monotone returned.

""Response, Mr. Ward.""

""Senator Grant never arrived—the Ethics Committee freeze canceled the meeting.""

The transcript updated: Reasonableness MODERATE; Confidence Impact NEUTRAL.

Ava's next volley queued. ""Are you implying the official calendar is fabricated?""

""Manipulated after the fact,"" he said.

The Bias-Mitigation Monitor flashed red: ""Conspiratorial implication; undermines institutional trust.""

Harper's lips compressed. ""Objection: unsupported. CounselOne will suppress speculative language in subsequent transcripts.""

Ward felt the correction like a mouthful of sand. Now every word had to be chosen from a drop-down, scored for risk and public confidence. He wanted to reach across the table, seize something real—yet all he felt was the chill of screens and the unblinking drift of the Bias-Mitigation Monitor.

The rest of the morning unfolded in short, algorithmic bursts: Miller from Ethics appeared via remote display—testimony pre-synced and auto-summarized. The system chopped her answers into ""High Veracity"" clips and played them in a voice only faintly hers—polished and polite. Ward tried to object on grounds of missing context, but each interruption was flagged ""combative; degrades public trust."" Judge Harper read the alerts with blank professionalism, as if scanning weather reports.

At recess, Dana hovered behind the blue partition. ""You see the docket footer today? Justice Accelerated—EO guidance. They've launched a new pipeline.""

Her hand trembled as she gathered her notes.

Lang returned with a fresh tablet, posture relaxed now that the prosecution's momentum was assured. Ward watched her confer with the CounselOne terminal, the screen's glow hardening her features into a mask of mild amusement. He searched for unease but found only the calm of a system that never balked at facts.

The afternoon session became a perfunctory rehash. Every word piped through an interface, parsed and distilled before hitting the record. Judge Harper let the heuristics do the heavy lifting, skimming flagged passages and ""public confidence"" overlays amid distracted notes. Occasionally she looked up, voice flat: ""Sustained,"" ""Overruled,"" or ""Proceed,"" as though deferring to a more decisive presence.

Ava Lang's chronology cut deeper as shadows lengthened. She recapped the grand jury's praise for ""procedural integrity,"" then cataloged Ward's public statements as breaches of ""narrative discipline."" Under the system's rules, truth mattered less than play. Ward tried to remind them of the President's campaign driving the probe, of donor-linked security firms behind courthouse networks—but each remark triggered ""unsupported speculation,"" and a private note to the judge: ADVERSARIAL BEHAVIOR ESCALATION.

The word ""adversarial"" grew heavier each time.

The air felt thinner with every objection that touched on motive or precedent. At one point, he reached for a water bottle only to find the cap replaced by a tamper-evident seal, like evidence. He cracked it, drank deep, the plastic taste sluicing over his tongue while the label's warning—EVIDENCE OF TAMPER—caught the light like a smirk.

He didn't sleep that night.

His hotel room glowed blue with vendor documentation. By two a.m. he'd exhausted public repositories, but he turned to the underbelly: deployment wikis, patch logs, QA tickets piling up in bureaucratic corners. He started with CounselOne metadata and burrowed downward—API endpoints, audit trails, even raw training data scraped from legacy DOJ case law. The more he read, the more technical jargon merged with legal overlays: each protocol version smuggled under executive orders, cloaked in neutrality like weather updates or vaccine notices.

At 3:41 a.m. he hit on Directive-88, Implementation Memo, stamped ""Sealed—EOP Internal."" The commit history showed two edits—first by a DOJ admin, then an override from ""EOP/Policy."" Ward's eyes tracked the diff, the additions so impeccably bureaucratic they'd clear any audit:

*""Whereas public confidence in the judiciary is a national security matter;*  
*Whereas adversarial actors present a legitimacy risk exceeding the threshold for manual review;*  
*It is the policy of this Office that all pre-indictment scoring shall be subject to Executive override conditions as defined below…""*

He scanned further, heart racing. Buried in the policy rationale:

*""Judicial discretion shall not obstruct the confidence metrics required for national stability. The utilization of adversarial-actor heuristics is mandatory in any case where Executive override is triggered, with thresholds set by the Office of Public Integrity.""*

Footnotes revealed ""Office of Public Integrity"" was a scar-tissue overlay—a rebranded West Wing bullpen staffed by campaign loyalists and think-tank holdovers. In past oversight hearings they'd called it ""Wildcatting"": policy fracking where every legal void became an opportunity for extraction.

He printed the memo; the hotel printer's hum faded as the white pages shimmered, vendor watermark faint even in grayscale.

The next morning, walking the half-mile from the metro, he rehearsed surfacing Directive-88 in open court without triggering the ""unauthorized disclosure"" clause. The city's light was the color of recycled glass, low clouds pressing courthouse banners flat against their poles. Protesters had thinned, replaced by a dribble of media interns queueing for the best camera angles. Lobby screens already looped the President's softened daytime address.

In the prep room, Dana waited with her nurse's calm. Ward set the memo between them. She gave it a quick up-down, lips pressed in silence.

""You know that's internal?"" she asked.

Ward nodded. ""It's cited in the public guidance. I'll take the contempt if it gets on record.""

Dana's gaze flickered. ""They'll flag you adversarial before the first sentence.""

""I'm already flagged,"" he said, pressing the memo flat with the heel of his hand.

The paper felt slick, almost greasy—a trick of the toner, or the weight of consequence. He gathered his jacket and last shreds of composure, then walked the corridor, letting ""public confidence as a national security matter"" repeat in his mind until it pulsed in time with his steps.

Courtroom 3B felt colder than ever, the vents whistling a wet-metal note above the procedural calm. Harper looked even grayer under the fluorescents, her pale face framed by a single sharp slash of lipstick. Lang sat poised, stylus at the ready.

Before Harper's gavel could fall, the Bias-Mitigation Monitor chirped, ""Exceptional Review in progress. Adversarial actor threshold exceeded.""

Ward rose, document in hand. ""Directive-88 implementation note,"" he said to the bench. ""Your Honor, court guidance mandates discretionary review, but the override is set upstream. Judicial discretion is simulated.""

Lang's lips twitched with pleasure as she lifted her tablet. Harper motioned for the paper, knuckles paling, and scanned its header. She glanced at Ward, then at the Monitor—long enough for him to sense her hesitation, then snapped back into poise.

Lang cut in, voice frictionless. ""If the defense is moving to introduce classified Executive guidance—""

The CounselOne display flared crimson: ""Potential Unauthorized Disclosure. Please confirm clearance level.""

Ward's wristband buzzed, intimate and cold.

He steadied himself. ""This reference is in public guidance, Your Honor. Directive-88 constrains pretrial deviation. The Executive override isn't theoretical.""

The Monitor blinked yellow, then orange. ""Adversarial assertion. Public confidence risk: 9.4% delta."" High enough for a sidebar—yet no one called time. A bead of sweat traced down Ward's back, proof the system hadn't chilled human revolt.

Harper's voice emerged flat, almost prerecorded. ""Mr. Ward, this court will not entertain baseless allegations of extrajudicial influence. CounselOne's metrics are proprietary but follow judicial norms.""

Her pupils flicked toward the printout, the room hanging on her next word.

Ignoring the CounselOne prompt—*""Rephrase for reduced risk?""*—Ward pressed on. ""Your Honor, the audit log shows you cannot override Executive-set thresholds. Public guidance says one thing; implementation notes say another.""

Harper's gaze darted to the Monitor once more.

Lang objected on schedule. ""The defense is undermining court confidence with unsupported conjecture.""

The Monitor seized the cue: ""Confidence Risk Escalation. Exceptional Review triggered.""

The air thickened, shadows pooling at the edges. Ward leaned forward, voice low for Harper alone. ""Your Honor, it's in the DOJ audit log—November 5th. Implementation Memo Directive-88, signed by EOP/Policy. This court lacks discretion; the President's office set the override. It's not classified—just vendor documentation.""

He slid the memo across the table.

For the first time, Harper hesitated.

A hum built in the gallery—thumbs against glass, jackets rustling—as the feed display on her bench doubled in size with a new overlay. Side-by-side: today's hearing and a C-Span archive thumbnail. Ward stared at his ghost: the old hearing room, the green-tinged Oversight Committee, his necktie too loud. The President's face loomed on every monitor, the same jaw-line and campaign font.

Grant's bored voice asked, ""Mr. Ward, repeat your prior procurement oversight testimony?""

He watched himself lean in, felt the slight tremor: ""The contract was awarded outside standard procedure. The White House pressured DOJ to bypass the review. Vendor selection was finalized before the RFP closed—""

On today's screen, a red supertitle: ADJUDICATED ADVERSARIAL ACTOR. Below, ""Political conflict of interest,"" and a watermark: PRESIDENTIAL ADVERSARY—HIGH RISK.

Ava Lang's velvet-knife voice cut in: ""For the record, did you provide written testimony against the President's anti-corruption reforms in 2021?""

He answered, ""Yes,"" the word snagging in his cheek as the transcript ticked it blue. Reasonableness: LOW. Confidence Impact: RED.

Lang folded her hands. ""No further questions.""

She didn't need a prompt.

Judge Harper's silence was weightier than any ruling. She scanned the memo, the counsel table, finally Ward himself. The Monitor flickered orange, then yellow, then settled on white, displaying: Credibility Score: 21.1%. Not truth, he knew, but acceptability—his entire record reduced to a confidence interval.

He stayed mute as Harper pronounced judgment. ""The court accepts Executive guidance. The objection is overruled; the record will note the defense's concern.""

Her words stung less than expected. He studied the back of her hand on the gavel—bloodless precision.

Finally, he signed the transcript with a digital stylus, a slow drag that scarred the screen.

It was over.

Lang gathered folders with surgical neatness. Dana, at the door, avoided his eyes but handed him a slim packet and a printed receipt: ""Case Disposition: Final. No further review.""

Ward slipped out the courthouse's side door into a plaza where the noon sun flattened everything into stark, shadowless shapes. Banners in campaign blues and gold proclaimed ""Justice—For Everyone"" beneath the President's portrait. A drone hovered overhead; protesters behind velvet ropes brandished #BurdenMet placards.

He wandered until glass towers erased the courthouse from view. Fingers stained with toner, he smoothed the Directive-88 printout. In a lobby window he glimpsed himself: disheveled hair, untucked shirt, sleepless eyes. Nearby clerks crowded a flatscreen replaying ""Defendant's Claims Unsubstantiated—System Holds,"" the ticker quoting the President: ""Bias is over.""

Every block echoed the courthouse's cadence—every surface an interface, every interface a leash. At the transit mall's end, a looping billboard shrank the verdict to ""Burden of proof met and exceeded,"" while a ticker crowed ""Public confidence up 3.2%."" His phone vibrated with phantom alerts; he let them pile up, letting the city's glare sand his vision down to one memory: the conference room's chill and the metallic taste of forensic water.

By the river—a lawn now usurped as courthouse spillover—he paused at a folding table where two monitors blinked five seconds behind live. Law students in branded windbreakers paused their rehearsed declarations to watch him morph into a digital ghost: thinning hair, hollowed eyes, framed by captions like ""ADJUDICATED"" and ""HIGH-IMPACT CASE STUDY."" Their mechanical laughter trailed off when his image cut away to the President's polished concern: ""We are not here to punish the past… We are done with favoritism and failure."" Phones rose in unison, recording the approved moment.

Ward stood at the fringe, his body less real than the fractal of its reflection. He remembered the memo—Directive-88—slipping into the record, neither erased nor noted, a fly in resin.

Back in his hotel room, he peeled off his shirt and collapsed on the bed. He opened his laptop: the archive had already redacted the final minutes of the hearing—Directive-88 severed mid-sentence, Harper's hesitation excised. A local feed retained the raw glitch. He replayed that half-beat where truth lingered until even it felt like data.

He closed the laptop.

In the hush—punctuated by the HVAC's faint tick—he held onto one phrase: ""Burden met."" He wondered if it would ever be spoken by a person, not a template.

Probably not.

The next morning, Ward watched a kid in a campaign hoodie loop the PSA for her friends. She mimicked the President's signature move at the crosswalk—fingers drumming air—and intoned: ""Fairness through automation."" Her voice was wrong: too human, too raw. Her friends laughed, and Ward heard his own voice refracted in that giggle.

At the courthouse, Dana sat in her engineer's booth, tapping through error logs. She shifted as he passed, eyes shadowed but steady. Ward caught a terminal window on her auxiliary monitor strobing with patch notes. He lingered, watching lines snap past—bug reports and backchannels, human panic in machine syntax. Near the bottom, a single line blinked on and off:

// human\_input: unknown\_source()

He stared, certain it would vanish, but the fragment persisted. Dana caught his gaze and, with the faintest eyebrow quirk, left the log visible just long enough. Then she cleared the terminal with practiced hands and turned to the morning's patch cycle.

As Ward made his way to the exit, the courthouse speakers crackled—just once, a faint digital burp that most people wouldn't notice. But to him, it sounded almost like a voice. The phrase came out clipped and staticky, as if caught between two frequencies: ""Burden met.""

The words floated, unprompted, and then faded, replaced by the usual PSA feed. No one looked up except a janitor, who paused mid-mop, squinted at the overhead, and shrugged.",1,1760790535.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

I mostly use public Wi-Fi at airports and coffee shops, so I figured it’d be smart to have something running in the background. I didn’t want to pay for a full subscription right away, so I started checking free VPN Reddit threads to see what works well on iPadOS.

I tried ProtonVPN first since it always shows up on best free VPN Reddit posts. It connected easily and the app looks clean on iPad, but the server selection is limited in the free version and the speeds were hit-or-miss. Then I gave Windscribe a shot and honestly liked it more server choices, solid speed, and the interface scales nicely on iPad.

I’m still just using the free tier for now, mostly for casual browsing and checking email. Haven’t had any crashes or weird issues so far, but I’m curious if there’s something even better that’s still free and works smoothly on iPad.

IF the gov pushed for GRC's to be voided would we have to fight to get a refund for them! Now I only paid £5 for mine. However my partner paid £75 for her.

Now with the EHRC appearing to pull the guidance and rumblings the HoL wants to get involved to throw it out are the tables turning for us..... slowly?

Since the guidance has been pulled is the likes of Virgin Active and the BTP going to change tune now? Only time will tell I guess.

Personally until I hear otherwise I'm taking this as a 'small win' but the little voice inside my head it saying 'keep an eye on the EHRC' as I don't trust them as far as I can throw them..

I throw up for hours. I throw up instantly if I have any sort of coffee (I love coffee). I don't throw up if I eat a hearty breakfast first thing though. I get diahrea instead. The doctors I have been to have tested me for so many things-but found nothing. I was recently tested for immunoglobulin a and that was low but they said since it was low it didn't really matter? I do have a cyst on my kidney and gallstones.

When this started I was on abilify 7mg and it seemed to be managing my symptoms well but it was observed that I was experiencing some side effects and went off of that. It was a bit of an adjustment but none of my typical extreme anxiety symptoms have really come back. I am a little bit more keyed up now but no attacks, I can easily calm myself if I notice I am getting too worked up. I was also diagnosed with ADHD and given medication for it and it seems to be helping some too. I can sit and focus and I can now pull myself from things (reddit) that I couldn't before.

I also have started to have extreme alcohol intolerance. Like I can't have 1/2 a beer without getting drunk. My doctor thinks that is just part of normal aging.

My coworkers are obsessed with giving gifts for literally every single thing. Birthdays, new babies, new houses, someone sneezes too hard – there’s a gift.

We usually all chip in like $20–$50 each depending on the occasion. Since I’m the only one without kids, apparently I “have more time” so I’m always the one who has to collect the money and actually go buy the gift.

Here’s where it gets a bit dodgy.

Instead of going to the shops, I started buying stuff from Gumtree ( Aussie version of craiglist) or Facebook Marketplace. People sell brand new things they got as “unwanted gifts” all the time, way cheaper than in stores. I only buy new things still in the box, so no one ever notices the difference.

Example- We decide roughly on a gift , e.g gardening stuff for a house warming. I go and find something on marketplace that's new and then I find the RRP on an actual shop website then we raise the money 5 ways. So website store price is 200 is 40 each but the Gumtree is like 130.  

I use it for coffees, snacks for the team, and sometimes petrol when I’m driving around picking things up. So it’s not like I’m stealing, right? Everyone kinda benefits.

Anyway, problem now is one of my coworkers asked for a receipt for the electronic photo frame thing I got her for her maternity leave. It broke after a few months and she wants to return it.

There is no receipt. It was from Marketplace. I told her I’d “check my emails” but now the team’s asking about warranty and all that and I’m lowkey panicking.

If I tell them the truth they’ll probably think I’ve been pocketing money. But if I hadn’t been doing this we’d have all spent way more over the years, and honestly no one else ever volunteers to organise this stuff.

I’ve saved them heaps of money and done all the running around. I just figured not chipping in was fair since I’m doing the work.

So… am I the asshole for buying “new but secondhand” gifts and keeping the leftover money for team stuff and petrol?",0,1760789691.0,AmItheAsshole,62,0.33,False
