Big read sorry, Turned into a vent towards the end.



AITAH

  
I'm 38 & wife is 34,

2 kids 13 & 6 y/o both boys

We both work 

  
I work between 6 am & 4:30 pm managing a company that supports people with disabilities  
  
Wife works different shifts, 12pm - 9:30 pm or 5pm until 10:30 pm. Depending on the roster her workdays are usually x2 12 pm - 9:30 pm shifts & x2 5pm until 10:30 pm shifts with 3 days off. 

Morning routine i will wake both the 13 & 6y/o up.  
get breakfast ready, make sure 13 y/o shower ect  
sometimes the 6y/o will try to sleep in or just lay in bed  
I will either make the 13 y/o lunch or have him make it ( i prefer he make it but if we wake up late, I will make it )

Put 1 load of random washing on

Between this I'm checking my work emails for short notice shift cancellations & trying to roster staff asap for shifts. 

13y/o will get ready and leave the house around 8am

I'll clean up the table and put dishes into the sink to be stacked into the dishwasher later.

Wife will wake up at 8 am & when she is up I leave and head to the office for the day.

She will finish getting the 6y/o ready for school and drop him off. Usually around 9 am he will get to school. This gripes me because school starts at 8:30. But it does not leave me resenting her. 

She will then return home and either go back to sleep, doom scroll social media or watch tv shows.  She will almost always go home after school drop off for the 6 y/o 

We all use an app called life360, On this app it lets us all see each other location, time at that location ect. This was initially used for us to help monitor our sons location as this year he wants his independence & without him having to report in every 10 minutes we can see where he is if needed. 

When viewing my wife's map location, 80% of the time she will return home & stay home until 11:45 am or 4:45pm when her shift is meant to start

If my wife has a 5pm shift she will pick the 6y/o up at 3pm and return home. 

I will leave work at 4:30 pm & pick the 6y/o up from afterschool supports on days my wife starts at 12pm. & for 5pm shifts I'll will meet her at work & pick the 6y/o up from there. 

13y/o will get the bus back home.

* When I get home this is mostly the routine   
* 13 & 6y/o empty their lunch box's
*  13 y/o put mobile phone on charge
*  have free time & play with the dog Vacuum while the boys are outside or pick toys & junk off from the floor
*  empty the dish washer Stack the dish washer with things that were used in the morning 
* Take out rubbish that the wife had overloaded while at work, Most times overflowing and general rubbish just sitting on the floor
* Clean dining table bench that wife has made dirty, leaving breadcrumbs all over it, butter & spreads left out, Knife left on bench. Coke can left on bench. takeaway wrappers I.E MacDonalds bags and empty drink cup, half eaten food on a plate or in a bowl ( 2 bins are directly under the Bench, 1 for general and 1 for recycling)
* Finish stacking the dish washer and turn it on
*  Re wash clothes not hung out from the morning (this consistently happens)
*  Watch some TV or YouTube 
* Read with 6y/o 
* Check if 13 y/o has homework
* Cook dinner 
* 13 y/o feeds both Dog & Cat before dinner 
* Kids have a shower after dinner Brush teeth Dirty clothes put in the washing machine Put 6y/o to bed usually around 8pm 
* 13 y/o has free time and will go to bed at 10:30 pm 
* hang out first load of washing & put another load on
* Clean mess from dinner
* Finish tidying the house now that the 6y/o wont mess it up again ( not a huge clean at all but fix couch cushions, Pick up towel from his shower, pack some toys away)
*  If needed sweep and mop the floor
* Dump first dry load of washing into the '' Doom'' Pile 

  
That's an overall summary of our Monday to Thursday.

Friday and Saturday the boys do what the like and just do important jobs

* Feed the animals 
* shower 
* help with toy pickup 
* Tidy the table for dinner

Saturday or Sunday i always check the 6y/o nails and cut them if needed  
I'll also book a barber if needed the following weekend if needed.

This routine might sound like a lot, but over the last 3 years i have tried so so many different things with the two boys and my wife. None worked except for pretty much me doing it. 

I do suspect that my wife had suffered with postnatal depression from our 6 y/o  
I supported her as much as i could physically & mentally could without destroying myself. 

When the 6y/o came home from hospital, I did all of the evening feeding with either formular or pre expressed milk. I did this with the 30 minute cluster feeding while my wife was snoring away & i did not wake her. I wanted her to rest as much as possible.

I would have no sleep for 24 hours and the worst was 36 hours. just so my wife could have a good sleep in the evening after watching a newborn and our other son.  My work was very accommodating and even allowed me to nap for an hour or two in the morning.   


I did the entire evening routine until he was 1 y/o and i mentally & physically couldn't do it anymore. 

  
From then onwards my wife really started to help out less and less. we spoke about it, Things would improve but eventually revert to me doing the cooking, cleaning, feeding, nappy changes, showering doctors' appointments & school drop off for out first son too.

Much like now, I would get how and i never expect a sparking clean house and everything tidy. Kids are mess and its always going to be '' Kid messy'' but i would retune home from work to like now, Food still on the table from breakfast, washing not down, rubbish piling up, floor sticky from seeming being spilled.

We spoke about this a few more times and my wife went to the Doctor for medication to help her mental health. 

This was in good intention to help the situation; however nothing improved over time.

I tried gifts, spa days with her best friend, holiday away with just us two. noting that i done helped improved this. 

During this time around 2 years into our 2nd baby, Financially we hit a wall. My wife's paid leave had ran out & she did not want to get another job in the ages care industry, I supported this decision and asked if she had looked into upskilling into nursing or something else. 

My wife procrastinated for another year while staying at home with no income. This is when firs started to be resentful and felt more of a financial cow / personal assistant than a father & husband.

I discussed this again and advised my wife of how damaging it is becoming financially and draining on my to continue doing all of the duties i do. 

I was never met with understanding but made to feel bad that I'm saying she is a bad mother and does almost nothing. 

  
I would pull back and stop doing things for months to see if my wife would pick up the slack for me.

* Not do washing 
* Not do dishes 
* Not check sons nails ( though i was checking) 
* Not booking medical appointments 
* Not cooking

Nothing improved when i pulled back. I spoke to her about it and again i was met with \* do you think i do nothing all day ?  ect \*

* I explained to my wife some of the below points
* that our new baby was now almost 4 years old and is going to day care.
* I picked up a 2nd morning job 6 am until 1pm ( I was previously working 2:30pm until 10:30 pm before my new current job )
* We are now living on gift cards and after pay because she wont work.

After doing this on and off for such a long time it had became obvious that it was not improving, She was not picking up the slack & the kids were suffering hygienically wise if i would not step in. 

I let her know that in 6 months if things arrent better ill be taking the boys and moving out. 

6 months come by and nothing is better, Infect she did not apply for one job during that time. 

I reached out to her father ( absolutely lovely man) and asked if we could stay there until i found a new rental.

He opened up and advized i could live there as long as me and the boys wanted, He has seen me do so so much for the kids and no help from my wife.  I was taken back by this as my impression was that being his child he would defend his daughter. 

We got a rental the two boys and i & the boys grandfather is around almost every 2nd day having a coffee and catch up. 

My wife would stay some nights and things really improved and it seemed that she had the wakeup call she needed. 

  
She moved it and initially things were well & fast forward until now, Its all back to how it previously was. 

However she now had a job

Credit where it is Due, She will now assist with booking doctors appointments for the two boys and organize their medications. 

However once again things are back to how they were before.   
I honestly do love her with everything i have but i can feel my resentment and frustration building up again. 

Additionally for more complexity and or me just jumping to conclusions it appears that she is either having inappropriate chats on her phone or cheating

In my line of work, We observe and work with people who have disabilities both verbal & non verbal. Because of this we are consistently reading and monitoring minor changes in behavior, body language, reactions & patterns to communicate & assist those people with disabilities effectively. 

I have no proof, However change in body language when i ask to use her phone,  No longer shares location on that life360 app & given the amount of free time she has before work is a horrible concoction of assumptions and snatiation that run through my head.  I hate snooping, however when i had gone to check her phone last night she was asleep laying on it, She is sleep protecting it now. On her apple watch it that i actually managed to chec, It seemed that so so much information had been deleted. The message section has 4 perople in total that had messaged her. Although i know she receives multiple of messages to her phone and watch while at work. 

I'm unsure if im actually worried something is happening or if im looking for something that will give me the ability to say \* so long don't come back\*

1qy6d5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1qy6d5f/struggling_with_galatians_519/,Struggling with Galatians 5:19,"So to preface, im a lifelong Christian. Baptized, raised in church. Etc. I know my bible and study (almost) daily. But there is one concept i have nore trouble with the more i try to learn about it. I dont understand the concept of ""living in sin"" i know people say its habitual unrepentant sin. But if watching too much TV is idolotry, if thinking sexually immoral thoughts falls under several sinful categories. Eating too much? Overweight? Even a little? Thats gluttony. Hoarding? Also gluttony. Need coffee to function properly? Now you have an addiction, that also falls under practicing witchcraft.(greek word being pharmakeia i believe). Got anger issues? Well, youve got another problem. Taking a few extra minutes on your break? Well now you're stealing time from your employer. Etc, Etc, Etc. 

To summarize when i read scripture such as Galatians 5:19. I see it reflected in the habits of even the most devout Christians i know. The only thing i can conclude is that the sins listed in this verse, and ""living in sin"" are being addressed in their most extreme forms. Such as premarital sex and extreme obesity. Drunkenness to the point of a life being totally bombed out all day. Anger, envy, reviling, all to the point of causing damage to relationships. 

I say all this because i am troubled by many things i see in my own life. Take meds to sleep, drink energy drinks to wake up. Trouble focusing or staying motivated at work. (Slothfulness). I try not to look at porn, yet regardless of abstinence, the lustful desires and fantasies always linger. Im easily frustrated and overwhelmed particularly with my coworkers. I could go on and on about all the little sinful habits i see in my own life and though i know the answer is complete surrender to Christ, but after years of struggling and agonizing and ""same ol, same ol"" im really just confused, lost and frustrated.

1qy6aeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1qy6aeg/the_psychology_of_attraction_sciencebased_habits/,The Psychology of Attraction: Science-Based Habits That Actually Make You Magnetic,"Look, I've spent way too much time diving into research papers, relationship podcasts, and books by actual psychologists trying to crack this code. Not because I'm some pickup artist wannabe, but because I was genuinely confused why some guys seemed to have it effortlessly while others (myself included, at one point) were completely invisible to women.

Here's what I found: attraction isn't about looks, money, or some mystery ""alpha"" bullshit. It's about specific, learnable habits that signal you're a high-value person. And no, I'm not talking about manipulative tricks. I'm talking about genuine behaviors rooted in psychology and human nature that make you magnetic.

Let's break it down.

\## Step 1: Stop Seeking Validation, Start Being Self-Contained

Women can smell neediness from a mile away. When you constantly seek approval, whether through excessive texting, trying too hard to impress, or changing yourself to fit what you think she wants, you're basically screaming ""I don't value myself.""

Research from attachment theory shows that securely attached people, those who are comfortable being independent while also connecting with others, are consistently rated as more attractive. Dr. Amir Levine's book \*[Attached](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)\* breaks this down perfectly. It's not about playing games or being distant. It's about having your own life, passions, and identity that doesn't revolve around getting female attention.

\*\*Practical move\*\*: Spend time on hobbies you genuinely love. Build something. Create art. Get obsessed with a skill. When you're genuinely invested in your own growth, you stop radiating desperation and start radiating purpose.

\## Step 2: Master the Art of Listening (Not Waiting to Talk)

Most guys think attraction is built through impressive stories or showing off accomplishments. Wrong. Psychologist John Gottman, who's studied relationships for over 40 years, found that emotional attunement, actually hearing and responding to someone, is one of the strongest predictors of connection.

When you listen to understand rather than respond, you make people feel seen. You ask follow-up questions. You remember details from previous conversations. You're present instead of scanning the room or checking your phone every five seconds.

\*\*[Try this](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)\*\*: Next conversation, focus entirely on what she's saying. Notice her energy shifts. Ask ""how did that make you feel?"" instead of jumping to solutions or your own stories. This isn't manipulation, it's basic human connection that most people are starving for.

\## Step 3: Physical Presence Beats Physical Appearance

Yeah, looks matter to some degree, but not nearly as much as you think. What matters way more is how you inhabit your body. Research published in \*Psychological Science\* found that expansive body language, taking up space confidently, is associated with increased attraction and perceived dominance.

Stand up straight. Move deliberately, not frantically. Make eye contact without staring like a creep. Get comfortable in your own skin through movement practices like martial arts, dancing, or even just regular gym sessions. The goal isn't to look like a model, it's to move like someone who's comfortable being alive.

Esther Perel talks about this in \*Mating in Captivity\*, how desire is drawn to confidence and comfort in one's own body. When you're fidgeting, slouching, or moving anxiously, you broadcast discomfort.

\## Step 4: Develop Emotional Intelligence, Not Emotional Numbness

The whole ""alpha male"" nonsense teaches guys to suppress emotions. That's garbage advice. What actually attracts women is emotional intelligence, the ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions in yourself and others.

This means you can have difficult conversations without shutting down. You can be vulnerable without being a mess. You can hold space for someone else's emotions without trying to fix them immediately. Daniel Goleman's work on emotional intelligence shows this skill set predicts relationship success better than IQ.

\*\*Resource worth checking\*\*: The app \*Finch\* is surprisingly good for building emotional awareness through daily check-ins and habit tracking. It gamifies self-reflection in a way that doesn't feel cheesy.

\## Step 5: Create Adventure, Not Routine Dates

Attraction fades in predictability. When every interaction is dinner and a movie, you're basically speedrunning the friend zone. Social psychologist Arthur Aron's famous study showed that couples who engaged in novel, exciting activities together reported higher relationship satisfaction and attraction.

This doesn't mean you need to go skydiving every weekend. It means breaking patterns. Instead of the same coffee shop, explore a new neighborhood. Try an activity neither of you has done. Create micro-adventures that spike adrenaline and dopamine.

When you're the guy who brings excitement and unpredictability (the good kind, not chaos), you become associated with positive, stimulating experiences. That's addictive.

\## Step 6: Stop Putting Women on Pedestals

This is probably the hardest habit to break because it feels counterintuitive. You think treating her like a goddess will make her like you. Actually, it does the opposite. When you pedestalize someone, you're communicating ""you're above me"" and killing any sexual tension.

Mark Manson talks about this in \*Models\* (genuinely one of the best books on attraction I've read). He argues for ""polarization"", being willing to disagree, challenge, and maintain your own opinions even if it risks her not liking you. This isn't about being a contrarian asshole. It's about having backbone.

\*\*Real talk\*\*: Treat women like full, complex human beings. That means sometimes disagreeing with them. Sometimes calling out behavior you don't like. Sometimes choosing your plans over hers. Mutual respect requires seeing each other as equals, not worship objects.

\## Step 7: Take Care of Your Mental Health Seriously

Nothing kills attraction faster than unprocessed trauma, anxiety, or depression leaking into every interaction. Women aren't therapists, and expecting them to fix you is a recipe for disaster.

Get therapy if you need it. Use apps like \*Insight Timer\* for meditation. Journal. Process your shit before trying to connect with someone else. A study in \*Journal of Social and Personal Relationships\* found that self-awareness and emotional regulation are critical factors in relationship formation.

For a more structured approach to self-improvement, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), a personalized learning app built by former Google experts that pulls from relationship psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create custom audio learning plans. You can set specific goals like ""become more confident in dating as an introvert"" and it'll generate tailored podcasts from sources like the books mentioned here plus tons of dating psychology research. You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples, and choose different voice styles (some people swear by the smoky, conversational tone for commute listening). The adaptive learning plan evolves based on what resonates with you, making it easier to actually internalize these concepts instead of just reading about them once and forgetting.

When you've done your inner work, you show up as a whole person rather than a collection of unmet needs desperately seeking validation through female attention.

\## Step 8: Build Something Bigger Than Yourself

Women are attracted to ambition and purpose, not because of money or status, but because it signals you're going somewhere. You have direction. You're not aimlessly drifting through life waiting for someone to give you meaning.

This could be building a business, creating art, contributing to your community, or developing a skill at a high level. The key is you're driven by internal motivation, not external validation. Cal Newport's \*So Good They Can't Ignore You\* absolutely nails this concept.

When you're genuinely passionate about something beyond getting laid, you become interesting. You have stories. You have energy. You're not boring.

\---

Bottom line: Attraction isn't magic, and it's not about tricks. It's about becoming someone who's genuinely worth being attracted to. Someone who's self-aware, purposeful, emotionally intelligent, and comfortable in their own skin. These habits won't make every woman fall for you, and that's the point. You're not trying to appeal to everyone. You're trying to become the kind of person who naturally attracts compatible people without forcing it.",1,1770445069.0,BuildToAttract,0,1.0,False

“Ma'am?” Was all the Sheriff managed to get out before I brusquely shoved the glossy laminated card in his face. If I was expecting to be taken seriously, despite how I looked, the trick would be to come on strong and not yield an inch. Make it clear that I was very much important, that I was very much in charge, and that I most certainly wouldn't be answering any questions.

“Hey, Officer. My name is Sasha Waybright, and I've been invested with the full trust and authority of the U.S. Government. I need a ride out to the Mystery Shack, on official business, and unless you want a very stern call from the Pentagon later, I'd really suggest you give me one.” Of course I'd expected to have some sort of effect, but the one I got far exceeded my wildest hopes. The Sheriff immediately spit out a mouthful of coffee, and the Deputy followed suite. Then they both gave each other looks of what appeared to be abject horror, like I was some awful nightmare come back to haunt them. Huh, that was new....not unwelcome, though.

“Aw, shucks, Sheriff, the fed's are back, and this time they've brought them cyborg teenage assassins that I done did seen about on the tee-vee. Be careful, Sir, she might have that newfangled laser vision.” The Deputy blurted out in the thickest southern drawl I'd ever heard in my life. Which was weird, given we were just about as far from the south as you could get and still be in the continental United States. The Sherriff gave him a stiff nod in agreement, looking grim. Between Soos, the lady at the diner, and now these two, I was starting to feel like I should avoid the tap water around here, just to be safe.

“Sure looks that way, Deputy Durland. And I'm way too close to putting in for retirement to go getting myself cyborg teenage assassinated now. I say we give the lady that ride she's lookin' for right quick, and hope there aint' no trouble.” Answered the Sheriff, in equally out-of-place vernacular, and he popped the lock on the back door of what could be only generously called a 'cruiser'. It looked like it had been built sixty years ago. I wasn't about to argue though, and hopped in the back seat with my bag. If this was what passed for law-enforcement in this town, my arrival had probably already made everyone else living here just bit safer.

“Mystery Shack, you said, Ma'am?” The Sheriff asked into the rear-view, once I'd shut the door and settled back into leather upholstery that certainly smelled like it was from sixty years ago, and I just nodded an authoritative affirmative in response. For some reason, both officers then elected to put on matching pairs of mirrored sunglasses, simultaneously, like they were in some eighties buddy-cop movie. “Let's roll, Durland.” was the last thing he said before flipping on the sirens for no good reason, throwing the cruiser into gear, peeling out with a shower of gravel, and tearing off down the middle of the thankfully empty street at full throttle.''

1qy68bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/fican/comments/1qy68bm/what_passive_income_actually_means_on_the/,What passive income actually means on the Financial Independence path.,"TL;DR: Passive income isn’t instant or effortless. Investing builds the base, dividends create cash flow over time and the goal is replacing expenses and not your salary.

⸻

What is passive income and why it matters

Passive income is often misunderstood.

It’s not money for doing nothing and it’s rarely instant. In most cases, passive income is the result of years of upfront effort and patience, where income gradually becomes less dependent on your time.

Active income stops when you stop working.

Passive income continues whether you take a day off, a month off or decide to change careers.

That difference is why passive income is such a core concept in financial independence.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Why passive income is important

Financial independence isn’t a single moment where everything suddenly changes.

It’s a gradual shift.

Passive income:

	•	Reduces reliance on a single paycheck

	•	Lowers stress around time off, health or life changes

	•	Creates flexibility long before full retirement

Financial Independence isn’t about never working again.

It’s about having options.

⸻

Investing as a practical path to passive income

Many so-called “passive income” ideas are really just second jobs.

Investing stands out because it:

	•	Scales without more hours worked

	•	Requires no customers or marketing

	•	Compounds quietly in the background

For most people, the foundation is:

	•	Broad market investing to grow capital

	•	Consistent, automated contributions

Growth builds the base.

Cash flow comes later.

⸻

How dividends fit in

Dividends don’t replace income overnight.

Early on, dividends are best reinvested to accelerate compounding.

As the portfolio grows, those dividends can gradually be redirected to cover expenses.

The goal isn’t to replace your salary.

The goal is to replace your spending.

That distinction matters.

⸻

Making passive income real (a simple example)

Let’s make this tangible, shall we?

Take a Canadian dividend ETF like Vanguard FTSE Canadian High Dividend Yield Index ETF (VDY).

With a yield around approx 5%, a $1,000 investment generates roughly $50 per year, paid out over the year.

On its own, that doesn’t feel like much.

But if a cup of coffee costs is $2, that’s about 25 coffees a year paid for by your investments, not your paycheque.

Now scale it:

	•	$10,000 invested → approx $500/year

	•	That’s roughly 250 coffees covered annually

At that point, your coffee habit is effectively paid for by dividends and you still own the ETF.

That’s how dividend income works in practice:

it replaces expenses one category at a time.

⸻

A common mistake

Chasing the highest yield often backfires.

Sustainable dividends matter more than headline yields.

Broad, diversified dividend ETFs tend to be more resilient than trying to pick individual winners.

Slow, boring and repeatable usually wins.

⸻

Closing thought

Passive income isn’t about escaping work.

It’s about reducing dependency on it.

When investments start covering parts of your life  coffee, phone bills, groceries. Financial Independence stops being theoretical and starts feeling real.

Curious how others here think about dividends and passive income on their Financial Independence journey. Also, I started this journey 7 years ago. When did you start yours?",0,1770444877.0,fican,1,0.33,False
1qy686f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qy686f,[OC] I made an X-Men OC! Let me know what you think!,"Codename: Rime

Mutant Ability: Cryo-Exhalation - Her mutation allows her to exhale super-cooled air at extreme subzero temperatures. Her breath rapidly draws heat from the surrounding environment, causing instant frost formation, flash-freezing surfaces, and crystallizing moisture in the air into dense ice.

Anneliese Eisner is a U.S.-born mutant raised in a German-speaking household, whose mutation manifests through her lungs when she hits puberty, resulting in a very awkward (and dangerous) situation at a public park when it develops completely out of nowhere. Panic ensued. The temperature plummeted. The situation only calms when Jean Grey and Scott Summers intervene, carefully de-escalating the incident before she freezes the entire area solid.

Later, her family is approached by Professor Charles Xavier, who offers Anneliese a place at the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters.

With every controlled breath, she releases super-cooled air capable of flash-freezing terrain, crystallizing moisture into rime ice, and turning entire spaces into hostile environments.

Rime’s ability is tied directly to her respiratory system. Overuse can trigger severe asthma-like attacks, oxygen deprivation, and loss of consciousness, like her lungs are freezing themselves from the inside out. Panic makes her stronger. Calm keeps her alive. Training isn’t just about combat; it’s about breathing.

If someone took the ice breath of a White Dragon from D&D and put it in a person.

Her everyday wardrobe consists of thermal-lined clothing, hoodies, zip-ups, and layered outfits designed to help regulate her body temperature. She’s rarely seen without a travel mug in hand, usually filled with tea, coffee, or something hot. (Though she may occasionally indulge in an iced drink. Very light ice. She’s not reckless. 😌)

Anyway! Just let me know what you think of her! I love her feedback in my OCs,, And if anyone wants to scream about OCs with me I’m 100% down!",0,1770444865.0,xmen,1,0.38,False

1qy5zmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qy5zmm/one_time_in_ladys_prison/,One time in lady's prison...,"At the first digital beep of my cheap alarm clock my eyes opened and I was fully alert. I disabled the alarm before sitting up in the quiet darkness. I  swung down from my bunk, making as little sound as possible. Stealth was a habit now, when you lived with 300 other women you learned to move quietly or you learned to fight.

I grabbed my plastic coffee mug, my toothbrush, tooth paste and a roll of toilet paper before stepping out onto the tier. A few other bleary eyed inmates were walking around the two story unit. It was too early for eye contact, too early to speak to anyone, that was just another rule we all learned to follow.

Sixty-seven quiet steps later I left my coffee cup on the water fountain before entering the shared bathroom. I liked the stall all the way on the end and it was open so I headed there to pee. I measured out my toilet paper carefully, we were back to only getting two rolls a week. Flush.

Six sinks were arrayed in front of the mirrored wall, some of them already in use. I stepped between a young girl doing her makeup and an old lady washing her face. I tapped the soap dispenser, washed my hands and then my face. Someone was smoking something foul  in the shower stalls and I was irritated by the smell. Careless bitches were going to bring the guards in here. I glanced at the elderly lady who was also sniffing the air, she huffed angrily and stomped out of the bathroom, her shower shoes slap slap slapping down the tier. ""Shut the fuck up!"" Someone yelled at her from the dark cells.

I brushed my teeth as quickly as I could. No use lingering with the idiots smoking what was probably k2 in the handicap shower stall. I wondered who our guard was, the shift had changed while I was asleep. I wiped the sink hurriedly with a paper towel and got out of there.

My mug was sitting undisturbed by the water fountain, I took it to the nearby hot water bun and filled it with hot water from the spigot. The scoop of instant coffee at  the bottom of the mug dissolved quickly as I swirled the water in the mug, saving me the trouble of a spoon.

As I walked back to my cell, I peered over the railing down to the bottom tier. The light in Gwen's cell was still off, she must still be in bed. I thought guiltily of the note that she had left on my bunk last night. ""I'm just having a hard day and I need some Bunny time.""

Bunny was my nickname, the affectionate version of Rabbit, which is what people that were not my friends called me. I was grateful I didn't have a worse nickname, there were some terrible ones and you didn't exactly get to choose. Mine was because I didn't eat meat.

I hadn't gone and sought Gwen out last night. I was exhausted and I just wanted to curl up in my bunk and hide. I worked two jobs in the prison, it made my time go faster.

Gwen was... needy. She was socially awkward and neurotic and too smart to be in prison. She got bullied because she wasn't tuned in to the heartbeat of the prison, she couldn't read the room, she said the wrong things at the wrong time. I was her only close friend and she followed me around like a puppy dog anytime I was in the unit, which with my two jobs wasn't often. My other friends were irked by her but they weren't unkind to her for my sake. At least not when I was around.

I reached my cell just as the lights in the common areas were flipped on. A chubby, balding male guard walked out of the guard station downstairs and bellowed ""CHOW! CHOW TIME! GO TO CHOW!""

""Oh my god shut up!"" someone yelled.

Unbothered, the guard continued to call us to breakfast. Damn, they were calling us early today. I scrambled to put my boots on. I couldn't go to the chow hall in my shower shoes, they'd turn me back at the door. I grabbed my ID and hurried out of my cell and down the stairs. Quietly quietly, one did not stomp down the  stairs at 6am without making enemies. Gwen's light was still off but I saw now that her bunk was empty. ""She must be at pill line."" I thought.

I slipped out the unit door right before the guard closed it. I descended the seven flights of stairs quickly then stepped out of the dark stairwell of the highrise and into the pale pre-dawn light of the courtyard. Dozens of other women from my unit walked with me, we moved toward the main prison building with single-minded purpose, like a flock of migrating birds. It was already hot outside, Texas in July.

Most of the women wore ""greys"" like me, the casual clothes we paid too much for on commissary. A few girls moved through the crowd in khaki uniforms, probably heading to work their prison jobs. Most of us were off on Saturdays.

""Bunny!"" Someone called. I spotted my girlfriend slowly walking backwards a little ways ahead of me. Her unit must have been let out before mine. She slowed her pace and I speeded up to meet her. Inmates couldn't stop here, it was against the rules. But we could dawdle and Jamie was a champion dawdler. She probably slow-walked for fifteen minutes or more so that we could have breakfast together.

""Hi baby."" I greeted her, wishing I could kiss her good morning. Not a chance with all the cameras here. Jamie blew me a kiss and then fell into step with me. She glanced behind us. ""Where's your shadow?"" Meaning Gwen. Jamie didn't like Gwen for cutting into our time together. ""Probably pill line."" I said, not taking the bait.

Jamie and I had had several arguments recently about me spending time with Gwen. She had laughed when I asked if she was jealous. Jamie was popular, athletic and pretty. She couldn't possibly be jealous of nerdy, chubby, awkward Gwen. So she said. I believed her. She was more upset at not having my full attention and all of my limited free time.

Then there was how it looked. Prison, like highschool, is obsessed with appearances and reputation. How did it look for Jamie to be at the softball game alone while I hung out on my unit with Gwen? Jamie cared deeply about these things, maybe because she was twenty-three or maybe because she was serving a thirty year sentence and this prison was her whole world.

We reached the doors and I held one open for my girl. I let my figertips graze the small of her back as she passed me. She giggled at my dangerous game.

It wasn't quiet here. Pill line was in full swing and an endless line of women stretched down the noisy hallway, all of them waiting for their turn to receive medication from one of the nurses at the head of the line. As we walked past the line my eyes searched for Gwen's curly dark blonde hair, a wild riotous mop that refused to be contained in her half hearted ponytails. 

Jamie was gliding next to me waving like a homecoming queen, greeting all of her friends by name. I dutifully said hello to people calling my name, but I continued to look for Gwen. How many times had I ran into her in pill line like this? Countless mornings. Her watery blue eyes would light up and she'd launch into a discussion of whatever book she was currently reading, talking non-stop as she trailed a glowering Jamie and I to breakfast.

We were nearing the end of the pill line and there was still no of sign of her. Maybe she had already gotten her pills and gone on to breakfast. I thought of her note from last night again. Written on the purple note paper that I had gifted her. Purple was her favorite. Small things like that were so precious in a place like this. Pretty things, colorful things were hard to come by in this stark, sterile world of concrete and iron. Why had she wasted some of it writing to me?

""Elevator?"" Jamie asked with a mischievous smile.

I pushed my thoughts of Gwen out of my mind. I'd spend time with her later to make up for not checking on her last night. I followed Jamie to the elevator.

We didn't have elevator passes, so riding the elevator was technically against the rules. Only inmates with medical issues got notes that allowed them to ride the elevators here. Jamie and I were healthy but risked the elevator ride often for the luxurious privacy that could be found there. Privacy was extremely hard to find in a crowded women's prison.

Jamie pressed the button to summon the elevator. A few seconds later the elevator doors opened and several women exited, one was in a wheelchair and another had a walker. Jamie and I hurried onto the empty elevator and pushed the button to go to the basement. As soon as the doors closed I pressed her up against the wall, kissing her passionately. She wrapped her arms around my neck and pressed her whole body hungrily against me for those few amazing seconds. When the elevator doors opened in the basement we were several feet apart in the elevator giggling. Jamie's cheeks were a pretty shade of pink and I wished we could take another elevator ride instead of going to chow.

Unfortunately for me, several women were waiting to enter the elevator and we reluctantly got out and headed to the chow hall. When we arrived, Jamie and I both showed our prison ID cards to the guard at the door. ""Which unit are you coming from?"" He barked. This guy was always a dick.

""2 South"" I said.

""2 North""  Jamie said.

""Why are you just getting here now?"" The guard said to Jamie ""2 North has been out for 30 minutes.""

Jamie gave him her prettiest smile.

"" Oh Mr. Mercado, you know I had to stop and get my pills first."" She cooed up at him.

""You go to chow first then pills, I should write you up."" He glared at her.

""Please Mr. Mercado, she won't do it again."" I said quietly. He liked it when you begged a little.

His radio went off and he raised it to his ear, waving us away. I didn't stop holding my breath until Jamie and I were in line for breakfast. We talked quietly together as the line moved forward, about how we would have to work around that guard in the mornings now. It was always frustrating when things like that happened because it made seeing each other even harder than it already was.

After we got our trays of oatmeal and a banana, I remembered Gwen and looked around the dining room for her. Jamie hissed my name and I followed her to an empty table. ""Are you STILL looking for that bitch?"" Whispered Jamie hotly. She knew I didn't like to argue in public, didn't like to make a scene. She was quiet because she knew I'd walk away if she got loud, leaving her to eat breakfast alone.

""Don't call her that."" I said softly.

""I don't know why--"" Jamie started but  cut her off with a wave of my hand.

""Let's just drop it. Eat your breakfast, baby. You want half of my banana?""

Jamie blinked at me but didn't argue. She grudgingly accepted the piece of banana  I held out and began smashing it into her oatmeal.

I was grateful to have avoided another installment of this particular argument between us. Jamie just simply did not get why I put up with Gwen, why I allowed Gwen to follow me around chattering as I worked out, as I cleaned my cell, as I tried to do really everything. If she could have followed me to work she certainly would have and in fact that is where I had first met Gwen, while working one of my jobs.

My main job was as a GED tutor and I spent my days teaching women how to multiply fractions and calculate the area of a triangle but my second job didn't have set hours, and was on an ""as needed"" basis. We were called suicide watch companions.

Whenever an inmate threatened or attempted to self-harm they would be put into a special observation cell with glass walls and only a mattress for furniture. Women on suicide watch were in crisis. They had to wear hospital-type gowns and be constantly watched. It was my job to watch them. I'd sit on the other side of that glass and just listen to them, watch over them while they slept, talk to them if they wanted to talk.

The first time I saw Gwen she was on suicide watch. She had tried to hang herself with her bedsheet and had almost died. We talked for my whole three hour shift. She talked about her job as a nurse before prison and about her children back home. They were on foster care and she was worried for them, worried she'd never get them back. She was on suicide watch for six days, I worked five shifts with her. We realized we were on the same unit and I promised to have a cup of coffee with her when she got off watch.

I never told Jamie where I met Gwen. Never told her about Gwen's time on suicide watch. It was confidential, and as companions we took that very seriously. So Jamie didn't understand, wouldn't ever understand.

""Do you want to go outside and walk the track after this?"" Jamie broke into my thoughts with her question.

""Let's meet up after lunch, baby."" I suggested gently.

She pouted at me and opened her mouth to argue when we heard the intercom above us.

""No inmate movement at this time, no movement.""

At the same time all of the nearby staff received a call on the radio, announcing a medical emergency. It wasn't unusual. There was a medical facility in our prison and someone was probably having a seizure or something. We wouldn't be allowed to leave the chow hall until the emergency had been cleared.

Many voices were talking on the staff radios now, asking and answering questions. Where was the emergency? What was the nature of the emergency? Staff from all over the prison was trying to move towards it to help.

Suddenly, I heard the chubby balding guard's voice saying ""Unit 2 South, inmate is ... inmate is hanging.""

Fuck fuck fuck.

Traditional 12oz bags cost more per pound because you’re paying for shipping, and retail margins every time. Buying in bulk lowers cost per cup and passes those savings directly to your household.

Small bags run out quickly and require constant repurchasing. Larger formats mean fewer orders, fewer deliveries, and less time spent restocking coffee each week.

Multiple small shipments increase fuel use and emissions. Consolidating coffee into fewer, larger deliveries reduces transportation footprint and overall environmental impact.

I’m 18f and I’ve been friends with this one girl since we were 14, she’s a sweet person really but there’s been a few things about her that just throw me off super bad. I’m a brown Muslim girl and she’s Chinese, she has never once invited me or our other friend that’s in our trio to her house, let alone actually make plans with us, but she’s always out and about with everyone else who isn’t the same minority as me and the other friend.

The second thing is that during school hours, she would only ever text our other friend, ask her to walk around and what not and she would never ask me unless that friend wasn’t there that day. For example for the past three days I couldn’t go to school due to not feeling well and she didn’t check on me at all , no texts no nth. The other friend wasn’t here today so she finally decided to text me asking if I was here.

The third thing that really threw me off for two years was that she was dating a guy who was OPENLY racist towards my minority, not even in a joking way he was deadass racist towards brown/Arab people all the time and she never once called him out but would always complain about him being racist???? After she broke up with him cuz he cheated on her w multiple girls she got mad when me and my friend told her he was a dick???? And she goes on and starts defending him like it’s one thing to complain about something and not do anything about it but to defend your racist cheating ex is insane.

The fourth thing would be a few weeks ago I invited my two friends over after school cuz I had come back from a three week trip and I wanted to spend some time with them. I made homemade tomato soup with homemade cheesy naan I made right in front of them. And at first, the Chinese friend didn’t wanna come over , but she came over an hour later the moment she found out our other friend was there and word for word she said “oh I would have came if I knew \_\_\_ was here”….okay….? Like is me inviting you not enough for you to come? My other friend brought it up later to me on how weird it was for her to say that to me after I invited her over after not seeing her after such a long time.

Another thing to add to this is that me and the other friend share the same religion, so we would go to prayers togheter and do small activities in the Mosque togheter and this one time we got coffee after and she texted my friend saying “oh why didn’t you guys tell me” like first of all you never make plans with us, and when any of us do make plans you come up with reasons why this day or that time is hard for you and you don’t even attempt to compromise with us but you seem to be going out perfectly fine with everyone else???? Make it make sense

I asked her multiple times if I did something wrong or not and she’s always like “no why are you asking” and then I’d say “because you were acting iffy” and then she’d say sorry. I get it it can be unintentional at times but it’s still annoying ",1,1770443408.0,AmIOverreacting,20,1.0,False

I know I haven’t written to you but I swear you’ve still been running rampant through my mind all week I must admit. I guess I’m feeling a bit sentimental today with V-Day around the corner; *you could say this is me bargaining I guess…?* I’ve been reflecting ever since my last letter to you after someone reached out to me and now I feel as if I was being somewhat harsh before.

*I’m so sorry but I have to do this to protect myself*, *my baby.* I really wish you understood where I was coming from when I made those statements. It wasn’t to offend you but I could see how my tone may have confused you in hindsight. My point in that letter was to encourage you to express how you really feel about this whole situation. 

Maybe you still want this deep down or are you still unserious about me? *I honestly do not have the slightest clue but I’m begging you to lead me in the right direction, my love*. I know sometimes I shoot myself in the foot when it comes to you but have you ever stopped to think that maybe I get *just as nervous as you do at times*? And yet you’re still always there, pulling me in deeper into this bond we have forged over time.

The worst part is I really did want to distance myself from you but every moment apart just feels like more time wasted. And like I told you in my last letter, I want to spend my life getting closer to you if you would allow it. *I just need you to make me feel safe to do so.* Truthfully, it  still feels like we are not all the way there yet despite closing the previous gap between us. However I’m willing to practice patience because I want to get it right this try. I just need you to work with me as I can’t grow our relationship by myself.

Anyways, I will see you soon. *Hope you have sweet dreams tonight, my darling angel*.

1qy5p6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1qy5p6m/the_psychology_of_routines_why_theyre_actually_a/,The Psychology of Routines: Why They're Actually a Love Language to Your Future Self,"
Look, I used to think routines were for robots. Like, why would I want to do the same thing every
day when I could just wing it and be spontaneous? Then I realized something wild: the most
successful, creative, fulfilled people I studied all had strict routines. Not because they're boring,
but because routines actually create freedom. Counterintuitive as hell, right?
I've spent the last year deep diving into this through books, research, podcasts, YouTube rabbit
holes, you name it. Talked to neuroscientists, read behavioral psychology studies, consumed
content from productivity experts. And here's what nobody tells you: routines aren't about
restriction. They're literally how you build the life you actually want instead of just reacting to
whatever chaos the day throws at you.
**1. Routines reduce decision fatigue so you can save brainpower for things that actually
matter**
Your brain makes about 35,000 decisions daily. Every single one drains your willpower battery.
Obama wore the same suit every day for this exact reason. When you automate the small stuff
(morning routine, workout time, meal prep), you free up mental energy for creative work,
relationships, problem solving.
Research from Duke University shows 40% of our daily actions aren't decisions at all, they're
habits. The question is whether you're building ones that serve you or ones that sabotage you.
**2. They create compound interest for your life**
James Clear's *Atomic Habits* completely changed how I think about this. He's a habit expert
who's studied this stuff for years and the book's sold millions of copies for good reason. The
concept is simple but insanely powerful: getting 1% better every day means you're 37 times
better after a year. That's not motivational BS, that's actual math.
Small routines stack up. Reading 20 pages daily? That's 30 books a year. Ten minutes of
meditation? That's 60 hours of mindfulness practice. The people who seem to have their lives
together aren't superhuman, they just automated the basics so they happen without thinking.
**3. Routines give you control when everything else feels chaotic**
This hit me hard during a particularly stressful period. When external circumstances are
unpredictable (and let's be real, they always are), having internal structure is literally the only
thing keeping you sane. Your routine becomes an anchor.
Andrew Huberman's podcast, the Huberman Lab, breaks down the neuroscience behind this.
He's a Stanford professor who explains how morning sunlight, consistent wake times, and structured routines literally regulate your nervous system. Your body craves predictability at a
biological level. When you give it that, anxiety decreases, sleep improves, mood stabilizes.
**4. Use habit stacking to make routines actually stick**
BJ Fogg's *Tiny Habits* is genuinely the best book I've read on behavior change. He's a
Stanford behavior scientist who's researched this for 20+ years. His method is stupid simple:
attach new habits to existing ones.
Already brush your teeth? Do five pushups right after. Already make coffee? Meditate while it
brews. The book will make you question everything you think you know about motivation and
willpower. Turns out most self help advice about just be disciplined is scientifically wrong. You
need systems, not motivation.
If you're looking to go deeper into habit science and behavioral psychology but feel
overwhelmed by where to start, there's an app called BeFreed that's worth checking out. Built by
Columbia alumni and Google AI experts, it pulls from top books like the ones mentioned here,
research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio learning tailored to your specific
goals.
You can type something like I struggle with building consistent routines as someone with ADHD
and it generates a structured learning plan just for you, drawing from relevant psychology
research and proven frameworks. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10 minute overviews
to 40 minute deep dives with examples. Plus there's a virtual coach called Freedia you can chat
with anytime to ask questions or get recommendations. Makes absorbing this kind of knowledge
way more addictive than scrolling.
**5. Build your ideal day, then reverse engineer your life**
Here's an exercise that actually works. Write down your perfect day, hour by hour. Not some
fantasy where you're on a beach doing nothing, but a day where you feel accomplished,
energized, fulfilled. What time do you wake up? What do you do first? When do you work?
Exercise? Connect with people?
Now look at your current routine. The gap between those two versions is your roadmap. Start
closing it one habit at a time.
The app Structured is incredible for this. It's a visual daily planner that lets you time block your
entire day. Sounds intense but it's actually freeing because you know exactly what you're doing Hal Elrod's *The Miracle Morning* is pretty hyped but honestly lives up to it. The guy survived a
car accident that should've killed him, rebuilt his life through morning routines, now he's helped
millions do the same. His SAVERS method (Silence, Affirmations, Visualization, Exercise,
Reading, Scribing) might sound cheesy but it works.
Your morning sets the tone for everything. You either win the morning or the morning wins you.
I'm not saying wake up at 4am and run a marathon, but having 30 minutes of intentional time
before checking your phone? Game changer.
**7. Weekly reviews keep you from drifting**
Every Sunday, spend 15 minutes reviewing your week. What worked? What didn't? What are
your top three priorities for next week? This comes from productivity systems like GTD (Getting
Things Done) and it's how high performers stay on track.
The app Finch is actually great for this too. It's a self care app with a little bird companion that
grows as you build habits. Sounds silly but the gamification genuinely helps with consistency
and the weekly check ins keep you accountable without being preachy.
**8. Routines aren't rigid, they're frameworks**
This is crucial. A good routine has structure but also flexibility. Life happens. You get sick, things
come up, plans change. That's fine. The goal isn't perfection, it's having a default mode that
serves you.
Think of it like jazz. Musicians improvise brilliantly because they've mastered the fundamentals
through routine practice. The structure enables the creativity, it doesn't kill it.
**9. Design your environment to make good routines inevitable**
Your environment shapes your behavior more than willpower ever will. Want to read more? Put
books everywhere and hide your phone. Want to exercise? Sleep in your workout clothes. Want
to eat better? Don't buy junk food.
I use Insight Timer for meditation because it tracks streaks and I'm competitive with myself.
Seeing a 90 day streak makes me not want to break it. That's just basic psychology working for
you instead of against you.
**10. The real magic is in the boring middle**
Everyone loves starting new routines. The first week you're motivated, energized, ready to
change your life. Then week three hits and it's boring. This is where most people quit. But here's
the thing: the boring middle is where the actual transformation happens. It's not about the routine itself, it's about who you become through the process of showing up
consistently. You're literally rewiring your brain, building new neural pathways, proving to
yourself that you're someone who follows through. That identity shift is worth more than any
single habit.
Your future self is watching what you do today. Every small choice is either a deposit or
withdrawal from the life you want. Routines aren't restrictive, they're respect. For your time, your
goals, your potential.
Start small. Pick one thing. Do it tomorrow. Then the next day. Then the next. Let it get boring. That's when you know it's working.",1,1770443192.0,ArtOfPresence,0,1.0,False

I am currently at a lower T150 school in New York, and ranks were just released. I am ranked very highly, and I have been updating my resume as I continue applying. I started applying about one to two weeks ago because I was waiting on grades, and did not want to apply with my candidacy judged primarily by my school’s overall ranking.

Now that I have strong grades and a class rank, I am applying much more aggressively. For context, I have prior legal experience in personal injury (legal assistant to team lead and spans over two years), and I have been framing my cover letters around firm culture (framing it specifically to the language on their sites) and how my client-facing, high-volume experience translates to BigLaw.

Realistically, am I too late in the cycle for NYC firms, especially for 2L opportunities? Also, with my school and background, am I still a competitive candidate if my grades are strong? I have not received any screeners yet, and I am worried that waiting for grades may have hurt my chances.

Also, what should I be doing right now to maximize my odds? I have been reaching out for coffee chats as well (didn't really start this until January) and am sending follow-ups with firms to mention those chats to indicate continued interest. However, this has been pretty hard because my alumni network is severely lacking in the Big Law market, even my undergrad.

  
P.S. Sorry for any typos, I am writing this panicked at nearly 1:00 AM lol

1qy5i8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausjdocs/comments/1qy5i8u/agpt_casper_assessment_guide_2026/,AGPT - CASPer Assessment Guide [2026],"I've been seeing quite a few posts in here discussing the 'uniqueness' of the CASPer exam. Whilst I have no opinion, the CASPer assessment is a requirement, and thus so is jumping through the vague hoop - nothing new for any seasoned medical professional. 

In an effort to clear up some ambiguities, and help direct our future GPs as to how to best perform in the assessment - I'm here to post my yearly CASPer guide with completely rewritten answers! The answers of old were touching on key points, but were too regimented. I've rewritten them all to be far more concise and realistic, rather than having perfect idealised long-length answers - these are now what is achievable for anyone.

Fundamentally, this is a emotional intelligence test - do you understand what others are going through? - can you stay within your lane? - do you recognise vulnerability and adjust accordingly? can you succinctly convey your thoughts with empathy? These are all key issues that GPs face day to day, and CASPer is hopefully going to now select for these skills. 

Please note the changes to CASPer as of 2025, and still apply in 2026 are as follows:

*The CASPer test is shortening to 65-85 minutes (from 90-110). Scenarios are reducing from 14 to 11, with 4 video-response and 7 typed-response scenarios. Each scenario now has 2 questions (typed previously had 3). Typed responses will be scored individually instead of per scenario. Response time for typed scenarios is decreasing from 5 to 3.5 minutes.*

Please note, this almost certainly means the idea of people saying 'I skipped question 3 sometimes and I still got q4' is dead in the water. Whilst I never believed they'd be high Q4s, and were likely borderline Q3s \[my opinion only\], since now each of the two questions have specific marks, they both must absolutely be answered and this is what I preach strongly to all my students, time allocation is key! There are still stories of missing a question or two totally and scoring Q4, but imagine if they had of answered them...

**\[very\] Quick FAQ:**

***Why should I prepare? It is assessing skills you can't prepare and they even say don't prepare for the exam...***

Great question, and you're totally right. There is a huge difference between rehearsing and memorising prepared responses and preparing. Many students focus on learning regimented structures that set you up to approach in a cookie-cutter manner, consuming YouTube videos and random prep companies - much to their own undoing. I honestly think more of them would do better if they'd literally done 0 preparation versus those certain places... Should you follow a structure, probably not - should you learn to convey your thoughts clearly and succinctly in their format, absolutely, and that is what this guide will help you do.

**The guide:**

Since it is prime CASPer time for those preparing for the AGPT / FSP come March & May, and I've been getting quite a few DMs asking for some advice, I figured I'd do a quick summarised guide giving you the main ideas I advise. I'm currently a University of Melbourne postgraduate MD student, but have extensive experience with CASPer, tutoring GP applicants and MD students for CASPer universities for the last few years. Whilst it is new to GP admission, it has been a core part of med school entry for 3+ years now. Since my background is psychology, I find CASPer very interesting and became a tutor very early on, finding significant success and have thus helped hundreds of students get the highest quartile. In 2025, 31 of 34 of my students received Q4 (can't win em' all), so have faith that this guide is on the right track. 

Lets get into it:

Firstly, you need to know your WPM. The first thing I ask people to do, if they don't already know it, is go find out their WPM. You can just 10fastfingers.com and find an answer within literally a minute. If you need some practice and want some (semi) fun practice, go to typeracer.com and practice against some real online people. When I was young I was semi-chasing a world record in WPM and often spent a lot of time on there. Your WPM sets the scene of what level of information you can output assuming equal thinking time to your peers. If you're on the lower end, (less than 55) then I would be advising you to avoid all filler words, and practice outputting only high yield sentences. Every sentence needs to have impact and hit a tenet or evidence your critical ethical thinking. If you're above 80, well done - you're well positioned to smash CASPer and have the luxury of either extra thinking time, or throwing in some low-yield sentences just to grab a few extra points. Your WPM and thinking time are mutually proportional, the higher your WPM, the more time you can think and the less time you need to type, in saying that, anyone can score a Quartile 4, you just likely need more preparation time to be able to come up with well thought out questions on the fly.

Now lets set the scene of the Quartile 1s to Quartile 4s that I see.

Generally in my experience of seeing many (many) students' work, I find the range of answers and their resulting scores tend to fall into the categories below with similar veins of thought respectively. Lets go with the quintessential classic 'caught a friend cheating in an exam' scenario that you've probably all seen. Feel free to have a crack at the scenario before you read my suggested answers and see which answer's level of thought matches yours.

Scenario: *You are a law student sitting your final university exam and see your friend cheating in the exam. They've previously been a good student and you've known them throughout your degree and you're quite close.*

Question 1. What do you do?

**General Quartile 1 answer:**

This question underpins the fundamental ethical principle of integrity which is essential to the legal field. I would speak to him in a private non-confrontational non-judgmental manner and kindly ask him to report himself, and if he did, I would do nothing else - if he didn't, I would report him.

**General Quartile 2 answer:**

I would speak to my friend in a non-judgmental and non-confrontational way and ask to speak to my friend privately and tell him I saw what he was doing. I would give him the chance to own up to his wrong deeds and allow him to confess his actions to the professor in the hopes for leniency. I would further suggest that this action may lead to him being allowed to sit an alternate exam. As he has previously been a good student, I think this cheating is out of character and would likely confess. If he didn't, then I would sadly have to report him myself.

**General Quartile 3 answer:**

This sounds like such a tough situation, and my friend is likely feeling really anxious and guilty. I'd want to approach carefully, as this could be delicate. I'd advise them I saw what they were doing, and ask them to report themselves, despite how scary it is. I'd emphasise the greater good, and offer to be there with them - ultimately if they refused, I'd have to report them to ensure fairness.

**General Quartile 4 answer:**

I can only imagine how desperate my friend is feeling, knowing how good of a student they've been in the past, they're likely quite vulnerable now. I'd approach carefully, and mention how tough the exam was, to normalise the difficulty and set the scene for openness. I'd make mention of what I thought I saw, and ask if they're okay - as that is my priority. I'd encourage them to own up to the cheating and speak to the professor to maintain equity to all - and offer to go with them for moral support, so they know they aren't alone, and then workshop ways to prepare going forwards, such as sharing my study notes that worked for me.

**A slightly lower Q4 alternative:**

I'd talk to my friend privately first, admit my own struggles to normalise the battle. If he cheated, I’d gently encourage him to come clean, maybe ask for a re-do given his stress. I’d stand by him, help draft an email or go with him to the professor. Cheating hurts learning, but everyone makes mistakes. My goal? Help him fix this with integrity while reminding him he’s not alone. If he’s open, I’d share study tips that have worked for me too.

As you work through these varying answers, you will notice that each answer builds in terms of its level of analysis of the situation, views it with a wider lens, and acts in a more empathetic manner. Initially, in quartile 1, they've rushed to solving the issue with little regard for their friend, which is and of itself unethical, despite acting in a 'right' manner. Notice how they've explicitly mentioned they'd act in a non-confrontational / non-judgmental manner? This immediately cues to any marker that you've been on Youtube and watched the stock standard videos and are now outputting a rather stock standard response without demonstrating the skills. It is a very didactic approach, you are telling the marker you will act perfectly, without showing the skills required to prove it. In quartile 2, they've provided improved problem solving, offered the friend a chance to resolve this himself, and has offered support in this situation. These are not very thought out answers and are very much commonplace that demonstrate minimal critical thinking.

In the Quartile 3 example you now see some depth of emotions and understanding. They are far more measured in their actions recognising the gravity of the situation. They are more empathetic to the plight of the person, and are more realistic in their actions. It isn't a simple - approach, confront, report, seen in Q1, but now represents what might actually happen in real life. It is still lacking in problem solving and self awareness though.

Quartile 4 captures the optimism, the recognition of previous goodness, and doesn't begin with negativity. It emphasises empathy, placing oneself in the other's shoes. They validate and normalise, we're all human, it happens - there is no judgement, demonstrated through actions not words. Their priorities are clear, their friend matters most, the confession or remedy isn't the priority, but the human in front of them is. They offer to stand by them, no turning of one's back, who would give up on a friend so readily? They are proactive, and provide support and long term solutions for next time. The answer is far more comprehensive and takes the reader through the journey of the answer start to finish, with clear emotions articulated throughout.

**I can't type that fast, they're all too long for me - what do I do?**

If you still think the answers are too long for you, that is okay. CASPer isn't looking to penalise you for your low typing speed - but I'd expect you to focus on dot points rather than paragraph-form responses. Key points only, but this will naturally sacrifice some empathetic tone. An extra addition I've started recommending to students, from the hundred or so I've had - I noticed that in the final 30-40 seconds students would freeze, unsure how to type out what they were thinking, panicking under pressure - deciding between different things they wanted to say -- in this situation, I advise to simply dot point your major thoughts/considerations. This will maximise what you can show in terms of skills, as your considerations are important - we want to see them! So throw them out there, forget grammar, maximise your chance at marks if you're suffering from paralysis by analysis. CASPer is very fair in that they really do emphasise they want to see your thoughts, not your grammar/structure, etc.

Next, you need to be cognisant and aware of what CASPer is testing you on. Unlike MMI where the goal posts are a bit ambiguous depending on the university - CASPer makes it very clear there are 9 core tenets - ""*These skills include collaboration, communication, empathy, fairness, ethics, motivation, problem solving, resilience and self-awareness*."". These should be at the forefront of your mind when answering CASPer, not in a check-box like fashion, but certainly something to consider in terms of, 'am I looking for chances to collaborate? is this outcome fair? have I self-sacrificed too much as a martyr in my problem solving?' - as these are what separate the quartiles at the end of the day.

My final piece of advice before I end up typing out a storm that bores you all to death - when answering any CASPer scenario, just remember your role in the situation. Whilst your day to day may be as a doctor - you are not being assessed on how you act like one now - they just want to see that you're a good human who can act in a decent way, don't try to control the situation and drive it towards medicine or forcing health upon people (these scenarios are common) - just be a good human and analyse the situation well, and you'll score well. This test, with the exact same questions is used for Nursing, Teaching, Physiotherapy, Vet med - being a doctor isn't your role (for this exam), being an empathetic and emotionally intelligent person is. Lastly - CASPer very clearly says in their documents that they are assessing what you WOULD do, not what you think you SHOULD do - taking a moral high ground isn't always ideal, and often is certainly not the goal let alone even realistic. Our GPs need to be (ideally) compassionate, empathetic, and socially intelligent. That is what this assessment aims to evaluate - just remember to be kind and understanding, and you will likely do well.

He was the guy I was complaining about.

I panicked and said, “Oh, uh, sorry, wrong conversation,” which did not clarify anything. He stared at me for a second, then turned back around without saying anything else.

We stood in silence until he got his drink and left. I ordered mine and tipped like I was apologizing to the universe.

Points System for Games and Standings: 

Five players from both nations race on the same seed (1.16.1 Ranked) 

Winner of the seed gets 15 points for their team

Second place gets 10

Third place gets 8

Fourth -> 6

Fifth -> 5

Sixth -> 4

Seventh -> 3

Eighth -> 2

Ninth -> 1

Tenth -> 0

Everyone who doesn’t finish after 20 minutes gains zero points for their team. 

After 5 rounds (each seed type), the team with more points wins the match.  

Standings tiebreaker is points difference. 3 points for a win and one point for the wild chance of a draw, just like football.

1qy5ecu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/1qy5ecu/perimerrymenopause/,Peri~Merry~Menopause,"Hello humans! More specifically you Hot Momma's flaunting those 40's and 50's! I have included a pilot blog post below and would appreciate any constructive criticism you can provide. I am interested to see if this content sparks conversation and encourages engagement in the comments.

Peri~Merry~Menopause

Menopause and its prelude, peri-menopause, often feel like a secret club no one talks about. Yet, by 2026, millions of women between 40 and 55 are sailing through this stormy sea. If you’re in this age group, you might be wondering: Am I alone? What’s normal? When should I see a doctor? This post is for you—a place to share real facts, personal reflections, and a little humor to lighten the mood. Let’s dive into the “peri-merry-menopause” together, with some pearls of wisdom and popcorn thoughts from women who are living it.
Pearls of Wisdom About Peri-Menopause
Peri-menopause is the transitional phase before menopause when your body starts to change hormone production. It can last several years and bring a mix of symptoms:
• Hot flashes and night sweats
• Mood swings and irritability
• Irregular periods
• Sleep disturbances
• Brain fog and memory lapses
• AND SO MUCH MORE TO PROVE YOU'RE NOT CRAZY
Did you know? Around 1.3 billion women worldwide will be in peri-menopause or post-menopause by 2026. That’s a huge community experiencing similar ups and downs.
Despite how common it is, menopause remains taboo in many cultures. It’s been part of women’s lives since, well, probably since Eve decided to take a bite of that apple. Maybe Adam noticed the mood swings too? The silence around this phase means many women suffer in isolation, unsure if their symptoms are “normal” or if they should seek help.
When to Talk to a Doctor, Herbalist, or Fairy
If your symptoms interfere with daily life, it’s time to chat with a healthcare professional. Here’s a quick guide:
• Doctor: For severe symptoms like heavy bleeding, intense mood swings, or sudden changes in health. Also, if you’re considering hormone replacement therapy or have other medical conditions.
• Herbalist or Natural Practitioner: If you want to explore natural remedies like black cohosh, evening primrose oil, or acupuncture. Just remember, natural doesn’t always mean safe—talk to your doctor before starting anything new.
• Hippy or Fairy (aka your supportive friend or community): For emotional support, sharing stories, and swapping old wives’ tales. Sometimes laughter and shared experiences are the best medicine.
Popcorn Thoughts: The Witch Theory and Other Musings
Here’s a little popcorn thought to chew on: There were never any witches in the 1600s. It was just middle-aged women going through what some call “the change.” Imagine the confusion and fear when no one understood what was happening. No wonder those women got a bad rap!
This phase is like a “string of pearls” — each symptom a bead, some shiny, some rough, but all part of the necklace of life. The problem is, there was never a knot to hold them together or a guidebook to prepare us. Grandma’s grandma didn’t talk to Ma, and Ma didn’t talk to us. It’s time to break that silence.
Talking to Your Spouse (If You Still Do)
Menopause doesn’t just affect women; it ripples through relationships too. If you still talk to your spouse, it helps to share what you’re experiencing. They might not get it right away, but opening the conversation can build understanding and patience.
Try saying something like:
""I’m going through some changes that make me feel like a rollercoaster. I might snap or get hot flashes, but it’s not about him, (for once). This honesty can ease tension and remind both of you that you’re on the same team. That read very theraputically more than I wanted. In all seriousness ladies, start thinking about all those mid-aged divorcee's that didn't talk about it...just sayingaaaaaaaa
A Community of Women Sharing Support
One of the best ways to survive peri-menopause is to connect with others who understand. Whether it’s online forums, local support groups, or casual coffee chats, sharing stories and remedies can be empowering.
Some old wives’ tales might surprise you:
• Drinking sage tea to reduce hot flashes
• Using flaxseed for hormone balance
• Wearing layered clothing to manage sudden temperature changes
While these aren’t cures, they offer comfort and a sense of control.
When Something Feels Odd, Talk to a Real Doctor
Remember, this blog is written by a friendly human, not a doctor. If you notice anything unusual—like severe pain, bleeding after menopause, or symptoms that don’t fit the pattern—see a healthcare professional promptly. Early diagnosis can catch other health issues that sometimes mimic menopause symptoms.
Wrapping Up with String of Pearls…
I was too late to prepare myself for peri-merry-menopause. It hit me when my life felt like a “string of pearls with no knot.” No warning, no guide, just a sudden plunge into hot flashes, mood swings, and confusion. But sharing these pearls of wisdom and popcorn thoughts, as I call them, with women like you makes the journey less lonely.
If you’re navigating this phase, remember: you’re not alone. Talk to your doctor, lean on a close human, find areas like this Blog and don’t be afraid to laugh at the chaos. This is a chapter of life that deserves to be spoken about openly and honestly so our daughters don't suffer from the silence.
Damnit, I know you, you 80’s and 90’s GENX Bitches! I am you! Don’t be a bitch and let’s help women, fuck it, the world learn to be more open and understanding of merry~peri~menopause. Follow me on a journey I did not see coming and look for more content to follow.

Next step: Follow me as I'll share some insight and hopefully one of you out there will benefit. Sharing our stories and YUCK'S might be the knot that holds that string of pearls together. Please let me know your thoughts and any feedback you may have as I test this out.

Best regards,

String of Pearls...with No Knot

I didn't do to well most of the day. Heavy induced radar radio gains to my eye sockets and eyes. Most of the morning until about midday. I suffered from heavy induced","radar radio gains. When they go after my eyes like that. Inducing radar radio gains to my eyes. All I want to do is sleep and shower. So the little hound dogs and I did nothing but really just slept, most of the day, until about three in the afternoon. I got up and worked on the back door, fixing the doggy door. This morning, around 6 AM, I was up as usual. Like most nights, I'm usually kept awake. But the skull f****** session air force/error-force style. I really got upset that he suffered for 2 hours. Nobody didn't do a dam thing to try to take the radar radio gains off his head, skull, and mouth. But honestly, according to radar radio traffic, ""AURLA-TRANSFER,"" the whole floor, the whole office, was being used by these Bay Area/Sacramento assholes with their plug-in, portable radio radars. The event took the phone lines, cell phones, handheld radios, and panic alarms offline. What the hell is going on with those people? I don't care. You don't let another human being suffer like that. And just let some delusional nutty nuts with their agenda attack the duty and senior staff. Over security clearances and restrained area IDs. These wannabe domestic local asshole trash from the V.A. They think they know how to handle things in society. Not wanting to go to jail. Not wanting to pay child support, car insurance, monthly bills, or their bail bondsman.
My question is: were they ever really in the military? And did they ever rate to be at the V.A. building, drinking and rubbing arms with everybody? Does it ever come out that they were nothing but a fake, trying to steal real benefits from real veterans? Then you got the other type that got kicked out of the Air Force. Went to work for the phone company? Use radar on all the employees. Until you got done in by their own greed. That criminal pride that came out of Colorado Springs of the seventies, eighties, and nineties to the Bay Area, to make a fortune for themselves? They're the ones who couldn't believe they had women in the Air Force Academy. What kind of mentality is it that you do not want women in college? I'm sorry, but I grew up coed. I grew up in a coed school where we were always together. We lived together from the age of five until we graduated high school. That's why I don't understand that mentality; you have to have females around you. I was raised in a manner that goes against today's modern society. I guess. It doesn't make sense. How can these modern society hypocrites look at their parents and say the things they say? But I have radar in me, and I don't have a right to my beliefs. According to some criminal pride Error-Force Houdini nutty nut mutt mouth in society who controls ""According to them on open air traffic"" through radar radio gains and AURLA-TRANSFER. Enjoy a glass of milk or a cup of coffee, tea, and have some steak and eggs. Maybe milk gravy and biscuits, or a Denver omelet, or tonight have a steak dinner accompanied by a fresh garden salad, fruit bowl, fries, onion rings, mashed potatoes, peas, and corn. Good wholesome breads, fresh baked daily. And a big bowl of ice cream. Eat to be healthy. Eat to be strong. 
Still alive since May 13th, 14th, and 15th, 1998. Still living with induced dB radio gains ""AURLA-TRANSFER"". In my mouth, eyes, eye sockets, ear channel, throat, face, and body. You don't have the right to victimize other people or me because you failed in your life. Stop torturing, tormenting, and victimizing folks with your use of synthetic aperture radar radio gains. I’m genuinely amazed by this extraordinary event, and I find myself in awe, trying to grasp its true meaning. It’s a moment so unexpected that it has left me feeling a bit overwhelmed, as if my usual understanding has been momentarily shifted. In this confusion, I am genuinely amazed by this remarkable event and find myself in awe, trying to understand its significance. It’s such an unexpected moment that I feel a little overwhelmed, as if my usual perspective has been temporarily altered. In this state of confusion, I feel somewhat fragile, as if my expectations have been profoundly shaken.

* **Stack:** Flutter + Python/FastAPI + Bedrock.
* **Core Feature:** You just speak (""Coffee $5"") and the AI handles the categorization, tagging, and logging instantly.
* **The Hook:** An ""AI Financial Coach"" that analyzes your spending patterns and roasts you (gently) to keep you accountable.

I just launched the MVP on Android. I’m looking for feedback specifically on the **onboarding flow**—does it feel too long for a simple utility app?

Happy to answer questions about the tech stack or the prompt engineering behind the categorization!

I've lost my period 2 times and had a really drawn out quasi-recovery. Never been able to fully quit exercise for any duration of time. Had 2 recovery periods recently that were short and light... I should be having a period now but it's delayed. May be related to travel, a lot of women without HA experience period delays during travel. I've also been super constipated which goes hand in hand with period delays for me.

I'm in India right now. Host family is being extremely generous with food and showing us all their choicest dishes served in the most delectable way possible. Coffee at their house is a cup of whole milk with a teaspoon of instant coffee in it!! ""Taking a walk"", like I still do every morning as a compulsive habit back home, isn't really a thing in a busy Indian city... there's no sidewalks and every street is insanely packed full of motor scooter traffic. The host family isn't really comfortable with me going outside alone and I know it's a bad idea. So I've been staying inside most of the day.

So I might be unintentionally getting closer to ""all-in"" for these next 2 weeks than I ever had the courage to go over the past 1.5 years I've struggled with period loss. If I hadn't messed up my body 2 years ago, it would be safe for me to just cut back for a month when I go back home to offset all the eating I've been doing here, maintain in a range I'm comfortable at & make sure all my usual clothes still fit in 2 months. But I abused my body and never had the courage to fully commit to healing it, so it's not safe for me to do that. I could potentially make this so much harder for myself and worse in the long run if I try to ""compensate"" in any way for what I'm doing now.

I'm travelling next month as well in another country where food is going to be a *really* big focus and I'm scared. What is supposed to be an amazing experience ends up being mildly psychologically torturous for me. I mean I can get over it and being polite and enjoying the experience always comes first for me, but... I guess the bottom line is I really wish I hadn't abused my body and mind so that I could just enjoy the damn food like a normal person and go on a short diet afterward like a normal person without risking putting my body back into its ""panic state"".",2,1770441655.0,Amenorrhearecovery,0,1.0,False

Uni starts back in two weeks, and during the break, I was desperate for cash, so I took a barista job I found on Gumtree for $15/hr. I knew the pay was low, but I really needed the money.

The cafe is owned by an Afghan man who also runs a vehicle business. From day one, He would hug me, touch me, and flirt in a way that made me really uncomfortable. I told him to stop, but it set a weird vibe immediately.

The ""cafe"", It’s basically under construction with a construction site on the side. The kitchen isn't finished, the footpath is blocked because of the huge building being build. as no one knows about the cafe because its basically hidden. and  and we get maybe one customer a week. 

once he took me to his other business and asked me what the problem was with his website because i said i studied IT. 

I was supposed to be a barista, but he expected me to Clean the construction site mess and the kitchen, Clean up after him and his friends who come in at night to smoke shisha and eat, Make TikToks for the business (then called them ""amateur"").Go talk to construction workers next door to get their schedules, even though I told him I felt unsafe doing that.

I also work a night job, so I’d show up on very little sleep, work until 1pm, and spend half my time cleaning up his friends' mess from the night before. He also wanted me to create a full breakfast menu. i put together popular breakfast items which go well with cafe but he showed me a ai generated image from chatgpt and said he wanted something like that.

The biggest issue: He promised to pay fortnightly, but when I ask, he says ""it’s not about money, it’s about building the business."" and its been a month

Lately, He started watching me on CCTV. One day I finished a massive list of cleaning tasks (windows, floors, kitchen) and sat down for a second because it was dead like always. He texted me: “You’re still sitting. I need the job done before i get there.” When I said I was mostly finished, he sent me a screenshot of myself sitting down taken from the CCTV camera. I felt very uncomfortable but went through with it.

A lot of customers said the coffee was too bitter and sour but he said it was my technique even though he sets the grinder. i also made TikTok like he said. but it was not professional enough for his business.

A few days ago, I sprained my wrist. I told him I couldn't come in and asked for my pay again. He said he’ll only pay me *half* because ""there’s no business."" I told him my wrist is going to take a long time to heal even though it healed just in a few hrs just so I don't have to go back.

I feel so stupid for staying this long but i need that money. Am I overreacting for wanting to quit and feeling like this is all wrong? ",5,1770441356.0,AmItheAsshole,14,0.78,False
1qy53vy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qy53vy,"I went to JT Foxx's ""AI Summit"" so you don't have to","Yesterday I went to the ""AI Summit"" event from JT Foxx in Dubai. It was free, but I paid for a VIP ticket just for kicks. I have an AI company and an education company myself, so I wanted to see what he was proposing. 

I knew exactly what I was getting into and saw it more as a social experiment.

Now, I must really compliment JT Foxx because he went beyond my expectations. I expected some content and a lot of pitch. Boy, was I wrong.

I have my notes open while I write this, so that I don’t miss anything.

And it turned out it wasn’t 20% content / 80% pitch as I expected.

It was really more 2% content, 50% delusional self aggrandising, and 48% pitch.

Here is the full breakdown of the training.

First 30 minutes: One of his lèche-cul (as they say in France) performed a very interesting introduction about how cool he is, how he used to work for Tony Robbins but chose JT instead, and, his words, ""JT is very, very rich.""

Then 2.5 hours from JT:

I am rich. I know a lot of people. Here's President Trump's number on my phone. Did I mention I know a lot of people? I will make you famous. I will build your brand. I will create your AI company even if you don't know shit. BTW, I am rich. Super rich. Also very smart. Celebrities like me. My clients are my family, and I make them meet celebrities.

Oh, and AI uses your data, so you should use a private AI instead. Here's my private AI with my brain in it. Buy it for $1,300.

Also, you can use the AI to do these things (proceeds with 17 bullet points super deep like “write your content”, “creating an AI Business”, etc… 10 minutes tops)

I kid you not, the FULL AI CONTENT OF THE MORNING was: ""Broke GPT is for poor people, you should use my AI. You can do these things.” 

Compare that with the screenshots of the program that I am putting here for context.

I was expecting AT LEAST to see some general mentions to that. 

I was curious to see how he would have framed it.

Apparently for this “AI Billionaire”, AI means a chatbot with a rag which he claims he spent 4.5 mills USD to develop. For context, I am not a developer, I did it myself in 4 hours just for kicks, including atomising knowledge and give it a logical structure and thinking patterns. I didn’t even have to buy extra credits for Claude Code.

Anyway, surprisingly, at least 20-30 people bought it.

Then, there was a special VIP lunch meet. Every participant in the VIP tier had the opportunity to take a picture with him (WOW!) and after some Q&A. Maybe that's where he spilled the goods, but despite having paid for it, I went to Costa Coffee for a drink. There's only so much BS I can withstand for research purposes!

And here we are with the afternoon: you need to brand yourself. And the way you do it? By sharing the stage with celebrities you pay to interview. Every billionaire has a personal brand (really? The few I've met, sometimes didn't even show up on Google except than for company filings etc).

Then 3 ""lucky"" people got coached by him:

First guy: ""I will write your book."" He probably picked the wrong person because when this guy said, ""To be honest, I already have 4 books out,"" JT's response was, ""If the first one doesn't sell, it's pointless to write the other 3."" You could see the dude was pissed, but then JT proceeded to ""write his book,"" which meant using his AI to brainstorm a title and chapter structure. Something you notoriously can't do on Claude or ChatGPT. 🙄

The other 2 weren't luckier. A nice dude in tech sales was destroyed for not being good at pitching his product, and the second person, a lady who mentors men, was completely shamed in front of everyone. But he did it for her! 😂

Throughout all of this, in case you forgot, he reminded us:

\- He will exit his AI company for $20B

\- He knows famous people

\- When he asks people to do stuff for him, they do

\- Tonino Lamborghini gave him a Lambo as a present (BTW: his father, Ferruccio, sold the car company 50 years ago, the only way for him to buy it would've been going to a dealership and paying for it 🤣🤣🤣)

\- He is rich

\- He is very rich

\- Here's me with famous people, and I bring along my clients (my clients are my family!)

\- He is the best in the world at reading body language

\- He is the only American guru known all over the world. He also said “yeah also Tony (Robbins)”. 

And if you want to become famous, here's the deal (prices approximate, USD):

Option 1: $3K - 2-day coaching with me

Option 2: $5K - That + white-label my AI and pretend it's yours. Then you'll exit with me and there will be plenty of moolah for all!

Option 3: $10K - Also speak at one of my events. Since I have connections, we'll speak at the Ferrari Museum or in front of the pyramids.

Option 4: $25K - You also speak at my LA event with 20 celebrities. Your 15 minutes of fame, take pictures with them and you're famous!

After that, people who signed up for this BS were called out to work with his ""coaches,"" and he stayed inside for Q&A. 

I was tempted to pretend I signed and go to smoke a well deserved shisha outside, but the love for science kept me in.

The theme of the Q&A? Why the fact that you're here means you're scared of change, investing in yourself, and you're fear-based. ""You will never make it."" That was literally the answer to any question. It was a very emotional moment. He looked extremely sad that we let our fears of wasting 25k stopping us from having pictures of us speaking on a stage in front of other people spending 25k to speak on a stage. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

And then, finally: 2 slides on how he scales a company. Two. Meaning exactly 2. 10 minutes tops.

And then off to Singapore, for his event there, to keep the hustle running.

At 5.30, I got my Uber and I went home ranting about how much this experience costed me in terms of time, but the reality is that I come out with a renewed sense of hope.

Whenever you doubt yourself, whenever you don't feel you're enough, just think of this guy. 

Now, for those who don't know: JT Foxx's real name is Justin Gorenko. 

A quick Google search will show you multiple lawsuits for fraud, sexual harassment cases, and more. It must be all the people envious of his success who try to sabotage him!

Fifteen years scamming people, multiple allegations of sexual misconduct and fraud, zero content, hyperbolic BS that would be so easy to fact-check. (For example he claimed that he spent $6K USD for the hotel conference room at the DoubleTree Al Jadaf. Sorry bro, you could've done the Address and spent the same 🤣🤣🤣)

But even with all that, he still makes ends meet. 

Just because he pushes while many of us lack the basic confidence to just ask.

Thanks, JT Foxx (or should I say Justin Gorenko). You might be a scammer and a liar, but you inspired me to do better!",13,1770441341.0,UAE,4,1.0,False

Here’s a tried-and-tested one-day itinerary focused on local flavors and serene vibes.  
  
1. Morning: Arrival & Local Delicacies (Near Yeongwol Station)

Daseulgi-haejang-guk (Marsh Snail Soup): Start your day right in front of the station. This hearty, savory soup is a local specialty known for its health benefits. It’s popular with locals, so expect a short wait on weekends!

Gondre Salt Bread: For dessert, grab a salt bread at a nearby bakery. Try the one infused with Gondre (thistle)—a unique local herb that gives the pastry a nutty, earthy flavor you won't find anywhere else.

2. Lunch: Yeongwol Seobu Market (Traditional Market Vibes)

Memil-jeon & Jeonbyeong: Head to the market's specialized buckwheat pancake section. Watch the grandmas skillfully thin out the batter. These pancakes are incredibly cheap, light, and delicious.

Ilmi Dakgangjeong: This is one of the top-tier sweet and spicy fried chicken spots in Korea. It’s perfect for grabbing a box to snack on later or as a picnic lunch.

3. Afternoon: Coffee Break at Cafe 'Palgoeri'

The Vibe: End your day at this stunning Hanok (traditional Korean house) cafe. It offers a peaceful atmosphere where you can enjoy the mountain views.

Signature Drinks: Don't miss the Corn Ice Cream Latte (Gangwon-do is famous for its corn!) or the Ssanghwa-spanner—a modern, creamy twist on traditional Korean herbal tea.

Quick Tips:

Transport: Accessible by train (Cheongnyangni Station → Yeongwol Station). Once there, using a taxi or renting a car is recommended as the spots are spread out.

Vibe: Perfect for slow travelers and foodies.",14,1770441312.0,koreatravel,0,0.94,False

I have recently moved out from a furnished studio property on the 23/01/26.

I received an email from my real estate agent on the 2/02/2026 I have attached down below the original email I received. 

Prior to moving out: I have paid for a full deep clean for a furnished apartment. 

I am more than happy to pay the actual retail value of the broken Lamp. Also more than happy to pay retail value for the reasonable things. However I was advised by the agent when I first moved in to ‘ use and dispose of things as required ‘. The linen listed was also just tucked away and the agent must not have looked hard enough as I did not remove them from the property. I don’t understand why they have demanded that I returned ‘food products’ as they had been mouldy on the date of the move. 

I should have been more thorough with my move in conditions report initially but I had blind trust with the agency as they seemed very friendly and reputable.  

They then sent a follow up email on the 06/02/26 claiming that a VCAT application had been submitted. I did not receive any correspondence from VCAT.  

I am honestly in such a bad mental spot right now. Completely lost and feeling very intimated and confused as they had provided zero quotes on anything.

1qy52gl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qy52gl,"How to sense your own dramaturgical potential? A 2D visualization of the multidimensional intrusion of ""story-making rules"" into our reality.","How to sense your own dramaturgical potential? A 2D visualization of the multidimensional intrusion of ""story-making rules"" into our reality.

The thing is, ""storytelling"" acts as a quantum capsule of the Hero-way-goal world we live in. Our world exists only when some story with some characters, ""heroes,"" takes place. In other words, an event is happening, and something or someone can detect that story and relate to it. Let’s think of a ""story happening"" as another dimensional effect on our reality, similar to how we consider time as a sort of different dimension.

How can we sense our own Dramaturgical Potential more accurately and usefully? There is a great method of imagining 4D by downgrading it minus one dimension. I love this one; here is a quick description (pic 1)

If we downgrade our world to 2D and think of ourselves as flat people on a sheet of paper, we will see the effect of a 3D worm messing around with our reality. If the worm goes through the paper, we will only see its circle in 2D. And if the worm bends and penetrates the paper again, we will see two circles of the worm. It will look like a cloned circle, and the worm can ""teleport"" when moving out of the paper. So for us in 2D, its actions and powers look wild. But that is its nature! It is just a worm!

Dramaturgy, the sense of the story, is the same 4D worm in our reality as a 3D worm in a 2D world. Dramaturgy's 4D worm is here now, on Reddit, in your head, in your tears, in your dreams, and in your fears.

That visualization is classic. But here is my original one. The goal of this visualization is to imagine how the ""4D story-making machine"" works in your head and in the objective world.

(Pic 2)

This is a circle. Don’t be afraid! It’s only a regular circle. You just aren’t used to seeing it naked, wearing only “math” on.

Please observe the dot in the center of the circle in the picture above for 5 seconds. What do you see? Do you see how everything “starts” there and later turns into all those geeky signs and equations that eventually work properly and make your coffee machine and Netflix work? This dot in the center is absolutely different. It is out of this world. It is literally that. A mathematical dot doesn’t have any dimensions. And it’s true. It doesn’t bring any new information into our Universe. It is just a \*\*point of entrance of dramaturgy into our world\*\*. A 3D or 2D dot point in the center of the graph always starts space-time around it, potentially until eternity.

If nothing starts to grow from that dot, nothing will happen at all and there is no story about anything.

(Pic 3)

So let’s see the simplified 2D graph of the ""2D Universe rules"" analogy.

Let’s imagine ourselves as flat 2D humans again. How can we represent our personal will and fate? Let’s imagine this spot that shapes our 2D reality as our central soul and decision-making center. Being in the center of a 2D world gives us the ability to move to any of the 360 degrees of the full circle around us. What happens to each degree from our central spot point of view? The width of the horizon of possibilities for future locations of a dot in a slice of a single degree as a sector grows until eternity. If you look from the center of the circle, the perimeter section you are capable of seeing will become wider and wider with the growth of the whole circle.

And now we will add an extra ingredient to this visualization that will demonstrate how visible complex actions of a 2D person could be easily performed. Consider Cellular Automaton. The computational machine that has simple input rules and sometimes produces complex behavior. I had a post on Reddit about that. Exactly \[rule 30\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule\_30), a combination of simple rules for black and white squares, gives high strangeness results! It is visible everywhere in the world, like on the shell of this snail.

(Pic 4)

We also use this rule 30 to create ""random"" number machines. Numbers are not random. They follow the rules. It is just we who can’t detect what will be the next ""number"" without going through every step of computation. Steven Wolfram even \[organized a prize\](https://www.rule30prize.org) of $30 000 for a person who can prove there is a way to skip computations and see what will be the future combination exactly.

So when we apply Automaton visualization to our circle, we will see that every degree of the circle has its potential unique and complex story unfolding until it reaches the perimeter.

(Pic 5)

So being a dot in the center, you have the ability to choose the rules like ""rule 30"" or any other of millions of unique mathematically combinations and apply it to any of your 360 existing degrees of freedom.

Choose the ""degrees"" where you apply your personal will to change the outcomes every turn of computational machine. Some of the pictures will be boring and degrade to oblivion.

(Pic 7)

But some of them, like rule 30, will amuse the audience potentially forever. So this visualization is basically an imprint of the ""character and its motivation"" in a 2D analogy. We might work the same, but our cellular automata are colorful and 3D. The only difference we are ruled not by black and white squares rules, but by simple dramaturgical rules that come from another dimension, visible in formulas like Dp = d/Sp that are described by computational dramaturgy.

Talent might be just a good combination of simple rules like “Rule 30” machine.

So you think you have some complex thinking happening in your unique story of life with your fragile soul, and you are correct, but also it is a simple set of rules that just compute the next step. All you have to do is gently surf unfolding computational waves in a search for a more useful outcome, especially for yourself. And you are always thinking only about yourself. I'll make a post logically proving that, tomorrow. Thanks for reading!

If you want to see more thought experiments like that just google ""computational Dramaturgy"" and free download a 99 page book called “Physics of Important Things.”

hey folks, figured i'd share some parking tips for the iowa vs northwestern game on 02/08 at 2:00 pm. parking around carver-hawkeye arena is honestly a mess, especially for a sunday afternoon game when traffic is already kinda unpredictable. you need a solid plan or you'll be stuck in the lot for an hour after the final buzzer.  
  
first, and i swear by this, check out Prked. it's an app where people near the arena rent out their driveways or garages. i used it for the last game and it was a game-changer. you literally park on someone's property right next to the neighborhood boundary, it's way cheaper than the official lots sometimes, and you completely skip the main traffic snarls getting into the lots on university lot 46 or the ones further out. it's a short, easy walk and you're not stuck in the bottleneck with everyone else.  
  
for official parking, you're mostly looking at lots 43, 46, and the finkbine golf course lot. lot 46 is the closest general public lot but it fills up fast, like seriously fast, so if you're not there by 12:30 pm for the 2:00 pm tip-off, you're probably wasting your time. there is usually a charge for these lots, often around $20 cash, but sometimes they change it up so bring small bills. the biggest headache is getting out of these lots, so if you park in 46, just plan to hang out for 30 minutes after the game.  
  
the finkbine lot is a little further out but they usually run a free shuttle to and from the arena. this is a much smarter move if you're arriving after 1:00 pm. it's less traffic to get into the lot, and you get a dedicated shuttle lane to skip some of the road traffic. for the return trip, it's pretty efficient.  
  
another alternative is to look for parking downtown. the city ramps are a walkable distance, maybe a 20-30 minute hike depending on which ramp you use (like the one near the old capitol or the dubuque street ramp). it's a decent walk but it's cheap parking and you get to bypass all the gameday traffic. just remember you'll be walking past the river which can be cold in february, so dress warm. also, check the bus routes- the iowa city cambus system is free and some routes run close to the arena.  
  
timing is everything. for the 2:00 pm start, traffic really starts to ramp up around 1:00 pm. if you plan to use an official lot, aim to be parked by 12:30 pm. if you're using Prked or parking in a residential area (be careful of residential permit zones- the city is strict), you can cut that closer, maybe 1:00 pm. getting out after the game is the worst part. everyone leaves at once. if you can, grab a bite to eat or a coffee somewhere nearby and wait out the traffic until about 4:30 pm or 5:00 pm.  
  
the main roads, like highway 1 and the roads coming off of melrose avenue, will be gridlocked. be patient and maybe load up a podcast. hope this helps you get in and out smoothly.",1,1770441151.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

1qy4yg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1qy4yg9/my_friend_is_acting_weird_with_only_me/,My friend is acting weird with only me,"Help I can’t tell if I’m overreacting about this or not.

I’m 18f and I’ve been friends with this one girl since we were 14, she’s a sweet person really but there’s been a few things about her that just throw me off super bad. I’m a brown Muslim girl and she’s Chinese, she has never once invited me or our other friend that’s in our trio to her house, let alone actually make plans with us, but she’s always out and about with everyone else who isn’t the same minority as me and the other friend.

The second thing is that during school hours, she would only ever text our other friend, ask her to walk around and what not and she would never ask me unless that friend wasn’t there that day. For example for the past three days I couldn’t go to school due to not feeling well and she didn’t check on me at all , no texts no nth. The other friend wasn’t here today so she finally decided to text me asking if I was here.

The third thing that really threw me off for two years was that she was dating a guy who was OPENLY racist towards my minority, not even in a joking way he was deadass racist towards brown/Arab people all the time and she never once called him out but would always complain about him being racist????

The fourth thing would be a few weeks ago I invited my two friends over after school cuz I had come back from a three week trip and I wanted to spend some time with them. I made homemade tomato soup with homemade cheesy naan I made right in front of them. And at first, the Chinese friend didn’t wanna come over , but she came over an hour later the moment she found out our other friend was there and word for word she said “oh I would have came if I knew \_\_\_ was here”….okay….? Like is me inviting you not enough for you to come? My other friend brought it up later to me on how weird it was for her to say that to me after I invited her over after not seeing her after such a long time.

Another thing to add to this is that me and the other friend share the same religion, so we would go to prayers togheter and do small activities in the Mosque togheter and this one time we got coffee after and she texted my friend saying “oh why didn’t you guys tell me” like first of all you never make plans with us, and when any of us do make plans you come up with reasons why this day or that time is hard for you and you don’t even attempt to compromise with us but you seem to be going out perfectly fine with everyone else???? Make it make sense

And I’ve tried asking her if I did anytning wrong multiple times but she legit js says denies me doing anything wrong, I love this friend I really do she’s a great person but this stuff genuinely upsets me so much like you might as well say mean things to my face",1,1770440869.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I've been working on a project [Aegis](https://github.com/pushkar-gr/Aegis). A high performance, distributed firewall designed to enforce identity based micro segmentation using eBPF.

I wanted to share it here because of the love towards self hosted networking gear, but to be honest about what it is (and what it isn't), don't waste your time here if you're looking for a WireGuard wrapper.

  
It’s a distributed firewall that blocks everything by default. You log in via a web portal, and the agent dynamically opens a pinhole to a specific service for your IP. Because it runs at the driver level, it benchmarks at **<100ns latency** and **25M+ packets/sec**.



* **It is NOT a VPN:** It doesn't encrypt traffic like Tailscale/WireGuard. It just allows or drops packets.
* **The ""Coffee Shop"" Issue:** It authenticates your **Source IP**. If you are behind CGNAT (shared public IP), authenticating effectively opens the door for everyone sharing that IP.
* **Best For:** Internal homelab segmentation.

  
I wrote the data plane in Rust and the control plane in Go. I'd love for you guys to check it out or roast the code.

This is my first time living on my own. Just got a quarterly water bill and it was a little over $10
I checked my usage on the other side. They recommend 150L per person per month. I was using AT MOST 60, usually around 30-40. 

I probably don't do my washing or dishes as often as I should, but I'm still doing at least a load of both twice a week. I take reasonable showers (maybe 5-6 mins if I'm really tired, usually around the 4 min mark). I usually shower every day unless I'm late for work. I drink pretty much only water/coffee/tea, so it's not like I'm buying all my drinks. Mop occasionally but that only uses a few litres

1qy4qou,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/1qy4qou/how_do_you_deal_with_these_kind_of_coworkers/,How do you deal with these kind of coworkers? Feeling excluded.,"For context po, i’m still under probation but di naman ganon kalayo gap ko sa mga new employees mga 2-3 months. this is my 3rd job and i know i have the experience with diff. kinds of people but, this is my first time encountering these kind of people.

Part ako ng team of around 10 and what i’ve noticed is may small groups din talaga within this team. May 1 small group na kasama yung ibang new employees din, i could tell na sila magkakaclose kasi lagi silang magkakasabay sa pagbili and pagpunta kung saan man…. Tapos meron isa doon na parang leader, leaderan.

As a new recruit, i like observing and just staying quiet muna. But tbh I’m very introverted din, so that’s why I prefer that. I’m not good at making conversations also, unless ikaw mag-start. I’m trying to get rid of this struggle of mine. Lahat naman sila okay naman kausap in terms of work.

What happens dito sa office nga lang is that most of the time, i feel purposefully left out. Siguro ganito talaga culture dito, most of them uuwi nang hindi nagpapaalam kahit good morning wala din. It just feels cold or nonchalant lang ba sila. Hindi naman sa nagbabalak ako mag-make friends, it’s just a much nicer feeling if natanong ka man lang if gusto mo sumama sa kanila or mag-aya man lang.

Pero what happens—they will talk about it in front of me, yung plans nila. As if wala ako doon. As if I’m invisible. I felt excluded. I mean what am I even supposed to do in that situation? Iniisip ko nalang ganon na ka-strong yung bond nila siguro. Siya iask nila if gusto bumaba para bumili ng coffee. Yung group nila specifically as if may favorite talaga. I don’t feel that bad naman kasi may ibang kateam ako na nagtatanong if gusto ko sumama and i really appreciate them kaso ang layo ng seats ko sa kanila.

It just feels off to me and i don’t want to question my instincts at this point. Parang it feels high school all over again, may kampihan. And they love to gossip, i mean gets ko yon. Pero i’m kind of worried tho di na ko magugulat if pinaguusapan din nila ako. It’s just not something I’d want to involve myself. Nakikisali naman ako sa chikahan and kwentuhan every lunch pero that’s it. I believe that’s just me setting boundaries.

May mali ba ako? Napaisip ako if kulang ba ko sa initiate ng conversations with them kaya di nila ko masyado nilalapitan. Do they think i’m boring? Pero kahit na, kung may alam akong may bagong employee, i wouldn’t want her to feel left out. Idk di kasi ako ganon klaseng tao. I would approach the newbie and not the other way around. I do approach them naman pero i think din kasi too early pa for me na mag-feeling close with them. Wala pa ngang 6 months… Feel free to give me an advice po. I know I came here to work and not make friends, pero siguro dahil mga ka-age ko din tong mga to idk what’s going on in their minds bakit ganon sila—it would be nice to have them as connections. I just want to work in peace but, this feeling keeps on bothering me.",1,1770440225.0,phcareers,1,1.0,False
1qy4pvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qy4pvr/the_american_sleep_experiment/,The American Sleep Experiment,"(My uncle was a Vietnam vet, same as my dad. I didn’t really know him since he never came to family functions, except for when someone died, then he’d at least silently show up to the funeral before absconding back to his home in New Jersey. He kept to himself I guess, living alone. No wife, no kids; dad said he was a dick, so maybe that had something to do with it. He died around three weeks ago, beating my dad out by nearly two decades and living to the age of 90. His neighbors apparently called in a welfare check since his mail and newspapers were piling up; at least it was cold enough out that his body didn’t decay very quickly, meaning I could just throw out the armchair he died in rather than bringing in a cleaning crew. The examiner said it was just old age that got him, so good for him, I guess. Anyway, I’ve been cleaning out his house to sell it, yada yada, and found this box of old school u-matic tapes in the crawlspace. I’m not kidding you when I say I need someone else to be witness to the shit I found on these tapes. I NEED someone else to know what I’ve seen, or I might go crazy trying to figure this all out by myself. Remember the Russian Sleep Experiment creepypasta? Well, that’s the first thing that popped into my brain as I started going down this crazy rabbit hole, so this shall by dubbed The American Sleep Experiment because why the hell not. The tapes are random and unmarked, so I’m just going to start transcribing them one by one. They were kept in rather poor conditions, so I don’t expect them to be well-preserved.)

 

**\[Tape 1\] \[ROOM-B / AM 07:30 / 09-JAN-73\]**

“It’s okay, Dave! It’s okay, it doesn’t even hurt! See?” The man had his left arm held out in front of him, blood dripping in slow, long rivulets off of it. A 6-inch strip of skin had been flayed off the top, muscle and fat exposed. The offending knife was held in the man’s right hand, being used to innocently gesture between the gory mess and the man named Dave.

“Jesus Casey! Put the knife down!” (Presumably) Dave stood by the kitchen counter, looking nauseous and as if he would fall to the ground if not for the tight grip he had on the counter. A naked man was sitting facing a corner, rocking back and forth, shoulders quaking as if he were crying; he was skinny, short brown hair, and from the angle of the camera you could just make out that he was wearing glasses. “The knife, Casey!”

“No, no, it’s okay! It’s okay! It doesn’t hurt at all,” as if to make his point, Casey dug the knife into the wound and smoothly sliced it perpendicular, more fresh blood welling up and dripping to the ground.

“CASEY!”

“Tell him Simon! We don’t have to hurt anymore!” Casey’s excited smile turned to the man quietly crying in the corner. No reply came, Simon seemingly not even aware that he was being addressed. Before more damage could be inflicted, Dave threw the metal bowl of fruit that was on the counter at Casey, hitting him square in the chest, apples and oranges falling to the tiled ground. Just as soon as the metal clattered to the ground, Dave had shot across the space, tackling the bleeding man to the ground, holding the wrist down that held the knife and using his other hand to punch Casey in the face, twice in quick succession. A pause, and then more hits came, pummeling into Casey’s face, but between blows Casey laughed, even as blood began to drip from his nose and lips.

**\[Tape 1\] \[ROOM-C / AM 07:40 / 09-JAN-73\]**

 A naked man sat on a stained mattress, knees to his chest, bloody-looking arms wrapped around them. He was switching between giggling to open laughing, his head thrown back with his guffaws. The only other furniture being a second bed and a turned-over bedside table with a lamp on the ground, shadows cloaking part of the room.

**\[Tape 1\] \[ROOM-D / AM 07:50 / 09-JAN-73\]**

An empty room, the furniture broken or moved from its original position. What appears to be blood smeared on the walls. Along with the smears there are handprints and repeated phrases.

*DONT SLEEP*

*THEYRE WATCHING*

*HURTS*

*INSIDE*

*ITS INSIDE*

*STOP*

*DONT STOP*

(Most of the film was damaged, so this is all I could get off of this one, sorry. Crazy though, right? I mean, this doesn’t look like some student film, these look like they’re coming from security cameras, so all I can think of is that either my uncle was an avant-garde filmmaker, or this is legit. Either way, enjoy this shit-tastic, crazy ride we’re about to go on.)

 

**\[Tape 2\] \[AM 07:00 / 22-DEC-72\]**

Six men are sitting on metal folding chairs in what is an otherwise empty room. They’re all wearing army clothes.

“Please state your names and age.” Someone offscreen says.

“Jack Richard Daniels, 21.” Man 1, white, brown hair, crewcut, muscular build.

“Gabriel Lee Guevara, 19.” Man 2, black hair, buzz cut, shortest.

“Justin Stolk, 20.” Man 3, bald, bulky.

“Simon Crocker, 19.” Man 4, light brown hair, short cut, wiry, glasses.

“David Brawnson, 20.” Man 5, brown hair, crewcut, average build.

“Casey T. Williams, 18.” Man 6, blonde hair, short curly, thin-average build.

The same man that’s offscreen, “Thank you, men. We want to congratulate you on being chosen for this experiment. As you have already been told, this experiment will be measuring the body’s ability to withstand sleep deprivation. You will be sealed inside a room and administered gas through your air filtration system periodically during the day for the next three weeks. The gas should be undetectable but do report in if you smell something. You will be keeping a daily journal; write down what you’re feeling, what activities you’re doing and when, and especially take notes of if you’re tired. If you’ll follow me, I will show you to where you will be staying.”

 

(The tape cuts into the security camera feed, but the audio is distorted and I can’t make out what they say in room A, which appears to be the entryway/front room. The cameras seem to switch between rooms every ten minutes, or at least that’s how the tape shows it. You’d think with it being the military it would be a little less rudimentary, but this was the 70s, so what do I know? Let me write down what each room is to make things easier:

Room-A: Entryway/front-room, shows the door and the rest of the room has two couches, a TV, coffee table, and a short bookcase with books and possibly magazines.

Room-B: The kitchen, pretty standard appliances, island counter, and a dining table near the back wall.

Room-C: Bedroom 1. All the bedrooms seems to be the same, two beds, bedside table with a lamp on top, a trunk at the end of each bed, and a closet on each side of the room.

Room-D: Bedroom 2.

Room-E: Bedroom 3.

Room-F: Bathroom. Kind of creepy they would have a camera in the bathroom too.

Room-G: Some sort of game room with exercise equipment, a ping-pong table, and a foosball table.)

 

(I found some pages at the bottom of the box. They look ripped out of a notebook and are all damaged, but some of it is legible. From what I’ve read, it’s a journal from one of the guys in the experiment, maybe even my uncle. I’ll transcribe them in the order that seems to make the most sense.)

(Page 1)

*-working, right? I haven’t felt tired at all; none of us have. Though maybe it’s just all a placebo thing? I don’t know. Doesn’t matter, I guess, so long as those scientists get their data and we get our stipend. I don’t like that we only have a clock to rely on to know what time of day it is though. Crocker has been keeping track of days for us since there’s no communication with the outside world; they said they’re not going to be talking to us unless it’s an emergency. Did I already mention how boring it is in here? You really don’t appreciate freedom until you’re stuck in a small house with five smelly men. Exercise and ping-pong are about the only things to do around here. Good ol’ Da-*

 

(Page 2)

*BORING!!! I think I’m going to lose my mind, same with the rest of the squad. We’ve taken to sharing our shit life stories just to break up the monotony. You think I want to hear how you shit your pants in third grade, Casey? Or how your meemaw cooks a mean turkey dinner every Christmas, Justin? No one here can cook for shit. We got a whole stocked pantry and all anyone can do is boil eggs. Thank God I like eggs.*

 

(Page 3)

*I called Simon a crock of shit today. I thought it was a pretty good joke but apparently he disagreed because he socked me right in the face. He’s got a wimp arm though, so I doubt the bruise will be big. The fellas held me back before I could punch his lights out  and the little shit ran and locked himself in the bathroom. I can hear Gabe saying something to him through the door, though I don’t know what. If he doesn’t apologize when he comes out, I’m definitely going to pummel him. The clock in the kitchen has stopped working, so maybe he’s just mad that he doesn’t get to be the timekeeper anymore.*

 

(Page 4)

*Justin is dead.*

 

(Page 5)

*They still won’t say anything or let us out. I’m beginning to wonder if they’re watching us at all or if we’re just trapped here. Maybe they’re just waiting for all of us to die; either get got by the gas, each other, or starvation. We sealed Justin’s body in his bedroom, wrapped up in sheets, but I can smell decomp each time I walk past his door. Are dead bodies supposed to start smelling this quickly?*

 

(Page 6)

*Everything hurts. My muscles, my joints, my bones, even my teeth hurt. It’s like a dull ache that won’t go away, and there’s no pain meds around to help. There’s so much pressure in my head that I almost want to drill into it. Good thing there’s no power tools around. Writing is about all I can do it at this point. It’s just something to focus on. Something to keep me sane. I haven’t seen the others writing in their journals for awhile now, maybe I should remind them. Or maybe they’ll think I’m insane for still writing in these stupid journals when we’ve all been abandoned. I hope this is just another part of the experiment and they’ll come for us soon. They said three weeks. I just have to hold out for three weeks and then they’ll let us out. God, please just let them come. Please. God, I’ll give you whatever you want, I just-*

 

(Page 7)

*Gabe won’t stop screaming. Maybe I’ll start screaming too. I just want this to be over. I don’t know what day it is.*

 

(Page 8)

*I think Gabe might be dead. He locked himself in the bathroom. We don’t hear anything and he won’t respond. He kept saying he wants to go to sleep now; that was three days ago. The main problem is that we hear knocking coming from Justin’s door. No one has had the courage to open it. Maybe I should-*

 

(Page 9)

*-not dead. The bathroom shower has been running and water has-*

*-knocking coming from the bathroom door now too. Why doesn’t Gabe just open the door? The knocking from Justin’s door has been getting progressively louder and more frequent. I don’t want to open the door, I really don’t, but I don’t think any of us can take much more of it now that there’s knocking coming from the bathroom door too. Everyone is at their breaking point I think. They’re always laughing, crying, or silent. I don’t th-*

 

(Page 10 and 11 is just nonsensical scribbles with “just open it”, “help”, and “dead” written and crossed out multiple times all over the front and back of the pages. Like I said, there are more pages but they’re all so damaged that I can’t make out more than a few words at a time. I’ll now keep transcribing the rest of the tapes. I forgot to mention, there’s 20 tapes in all.)

 

**\[Tape 3A\] \[ROOM-B / PM 06:40 / 28-DEC-72\]**

All six men seem to be having a good time, leaning on the counter or sitting on the stools surrounding it, eating. They’re laughing raucously, Justin suddenly choking on his food. The men laugh more, with Casey slapping Justin’s back. Justin’s coughing fit doesn’t cease though, and instead he starts grabbing his chest, wheezing heavily as he stands up. The other men seem to be growing concerned, asking if he’s okay. Dave leans over the counter with a smirk, “THAT’S why you don’t inhale your food you fat pig!”

Justin suddenly falls to the ground, coughing and grabbing onto where his heart is. The others jump into action, Simon and Casey dropping to their knees around Justin, the others quickly coming from the other side of the island to stand over him. Questions of “are you okay” and “what are you feeling” are being directed at the large man who starts to kick his feet and twist his body. All of a sudden he stops, falling limp. Panic sets in, Casey shaking Justin’s body before Jack pushes him out of the way and begins to perform CPR. Dave waves his arms at the camera while Gabe runs offscreen.

 

**\[Tape 3A\] \[ROOM-C / PM 06:50 / 28-DEC-72\]**

No one is onscreen, but you can hear the commotion in the background.

Dave: “Hey! HEY! We’ve got a man down in here! We need help! It’s an emergency!”

The sound of rapid pounding on metal.

Gabe: “Hey open up! Hello, is anyone out there?! We need medical!”

Dave: “Oh Jesus! Come on! Emergency! HELLO?! OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR!”

(This goes on for awhile like that.)

 

**\[Tape 3B\] \[ROOM-B / PM 07:50 / 28-DEC-72\]**

Everyone is either standing or sitting in the kitchen, Jack still sitting near Justin’s body. Jack stands up, addressing no one in particular, just staring at Justin’s body, “Come on, let’s put him in one of the rooms.” No one says anything or jumps into action.

“I’ll help,” Dave volunteers, “Which room?”

“His and Simon’s.”

“I don’t want to sleep with a dead body,” the tone is lifeless as it rolls out of Simon’s mouth, more automatic than anything else.

“WELL WHERE ELSE SHOULD WE PUT HIM?!” Dave yells, rounding on Simon, aggressively taking a step toward him.

“He can take my bed,” Jack wearily declares, trying to diffuse the situation before it blows out of control, “I’ll take the couch. Though it’s not like we can sleep anyway.” That reminder seems to settle heavy on the group, no one moving or saying anything until Jack motions to Justin’s body, “Help me out with this, Dave.” Dave reaches for Justin’s legs.

 

**\[Tape 3C\] \[ROOM-C / PM 08:00 / 28-DEC-72\]**

Dave: “Shit, he’s so damn heavy. Someone come grab his other leg.”

Casey: “I’ve got it. Simon, you get his other shoulder. Gabe, direct us so we don’t run into anything.”

Noises of shuffling and grunts can be slightly heard.

 

**\[Tape 3C\] \[ROOM-D / PM 08:10 / 28-DEC-72\]**

Empty room, but noises can still be heard.

Jack: “Alright, alright, just set him down and roll him onto the bed. Ya, there we go.”

There’s a long pause.

Jack: “Take off his shoes.”

Gabe: “Why?”

Jack: “It’s respectful. Just do it. We should wrap the sheets and blankets around him too.”

There are barely audible shuffling sounds before a long silence again.

Gabe: “When do you think they’ll come and get his body?”

 

**\[Tape 3C\] \[ROOM-E / PM 08:20 / 28-DEC-72\]**

Everyone is standing around the right bed where Justin’s wrapped body lay.

“They won’t,” Jack says solemnly.

“What do you mean they won’t?!” Dave glowered at Jack.

“What I mean is, it’s been over an hour now and still no one has come. There must be people watching the camera feed 24/7, so we’re probably not being ignored.”

“That doesn’t mean someone isn’t coming,” Simon butted in, “Maybe they’re wrapped up in red-tape and it’s taking a while. Or maybe they have to wait for the gas to clear out! That’s probably what is happening. We just have to wait 24 hours for the gas to clear and then we’ll all be out of here.” No one responds, but that seems to be the consensus; if nothing else, it’s the only option that carries any hope. The group starts to file out of the room, the door being closed behind them.

(The rest of the tape is just them milling about, no one saying anything or doing anything of particular note.)

 

**\[Tape 4A and 4B\] \[24-DEC-72\]**

(The tapes just consist of them doing various activities or talking, and it goes on for an hour on each. The audio is shot though, so I can’t make out what is said.)

 

(Some of these tapes are wrapped together to show they’re from the same day, but otherwise they seem to be out of order. They’re unmarked so there’s nothing I can really do about that. Since there aren’t hundreds of tapes, I can only assume that each was hand-picked as being the most important events. So far, 3 tapes aren’t working.)

 

**\[Tape 5A\] \[ROOM-F / AM 02:13 / 02-JAN-73\]**

Gabe is just unblinkingly staring at himself in the bathroom mirror.

(Everyone is just quietly lying motionless in the other rooms, except for Simon who is pacing around in Room-G.)

 

**\[Tape 5B\] \[ROOM-E / AM 03:08 / 02-JAN-73\]**

(I nearly jumped out of my skin as someone suddenly started screaming.)

 

**\[Tape 5B\] \[ROOM-F / AM 03:10 / 02-JAN-73\]**

(It’s Gabe, he’s the one screaming at the top of his lungs.)

Simon comes running into the bathroom, quickly assessing the scene before grabbing Gabe by the shoulder and shaking him. When that fails to ease the screaming, Simon begins to full-on shake him with both hands. Jack shows up at the doorway, seemingly trying to ask what is happening.

(Gabe’s screaming is too loud for me to be able to make out what the two might be saying. Dave doesn’t move from where he is in his room, laying on his bed; he just puts a pillow over his head though. Eventually Gabe is left in the bathroom with the door closed, Jack wandering to the couch to lay down on it while Simon goes back to pacing, this time covering his ears with his hands.)

 

**\[Tape 5C\] \[ROOM-A / PM 09:20 / 02-JAN-73\]**

“LET US OUT! LET US OUT! WE’RE DYING IN HERE!” Dave is beating his fists against the metal door. He suddenly switches to screaming at the door before suddenly ramming his shoulder against it. After 4 times of trying that, he wildly looks around before leaving the scene and then returning, holding one of the kitchen’s barstools.

Jack is on his bed, furiously scratching at his arms, neck, and exposed chest, large welts appearing from the irritated skin. A steady thud can be heard from outside the room.

(Holy shit!)

Jack is in the kitchen furiously scrubbing his arms with a cheese grater, mumbling to himself.

(I can only barely make out him saying “Get them out”.)

He suddenly sprints out of the room with a guttural yell, taking the grater with him.

Dave is huddled facing a corner, leaning his head against the wall, unmoving. Casey’s body is draped on the couch with an open smile on his face. A large portion of his intestines have spilled out of his belly from a perpendicular cut. Loud laughter can be heard coming from some other room.

Jack is writing on the already bloody wall, making scribbles with his fingertips, occasionally scratching his shredded arms to procure more blood for his writing.

A stout man with receding brown hair and glasses is sitting on a chair in front of the camera.

“This is Doctor Scott G. Wells, reporting on case number 3-M-D2-J3. Gas PFAS-N2 has proven effective in keeping test subjects from sleeping and feeling the need to sleep. However, the side-effects are still… unfortunate. The most prevalent side-effects appear to be hallucinations of all five senses, with some subjects experiencing more than one. Other side-effects included mania, aggression, depression, faulty pain receptors, among others; please refer to the case files for the full list.”

He rifles through some of the paperwork in front of him, “The test-area was opened on January 12^(th) after 24-hours of venting out the gas. All but two of the subjects are dead. Subject Justin Stolk died of a heart attack, presumed to be caused by gas PFAS-N2. Subject Gabriel Guevara died by suicide via drowning in the bathtub. Subject Casey Williams died of blood loss due to self-inflicted wounds. Subject Simon Crocker died by suicide via severing his aortic artery. Subject Jack Daniels is currently being treated for blood-loss but is alive; he has needed to be restrained due to continually trying to scratch himself and appears to still be in a manic emotional state. Subject David Bradshaw is in a catatonic state, and we do not anticipate him recovering. Considering all previous trials proved 100% fatal, we will be moving both subjects to hospice and will monitor them from there.” The doctor gets up and a few seconds later the film ends.

 

(My uncle’s name is David Bradshaw. How he recovered, and how he obtained all of these tapes, I can only speculate. I have to wonder what was on the other tapes, but they don’t work or show anything when I try to play them. There might be some sort of restoration place that could fix them, but I’m honestly just… done. I don’t want to rewatch these, ever again. I just want to go home and hug my dog. I feel like the tapes are too important to just throw away, but I’m going to be squirreling them away somewhere where I’ll never have to look at them again. You guys are the only ones I’m sharing this with; I don’t dare show it to my family or friends. I’m sorry we had to go on this horror-filled journey together, but this just isn’t a burden I’m willing to carry on my own; especially if it’s real, in which case I’m just going to pray the government doesn’t come knocking on my door.

Anyways, I came from 9.5 years in the Army Infantry and 2 deployments. I thought I'd love nothing more than a cubicle with nice air conditioning and not having to sleep in dirt. 

Came into corporate america a few years ago here in Washington state and now a middle manager. Why is everything so lame lol 

- End of year reviews? Sorry nobody can get a 4 or a 5(on a 1-5 scale). 3 is the most you can get because your Vice President and HR department deemed it so(So really, why bother going above and beyond?) I cant even blame the workers that do the bare minimum, what's their incentive to do better? 

- Bonus? ""Based on company performance"", yet when the C-Suite announces how well the company did and ""knocked it out the park for 4 quarters in a row"", bonus stays the same or less. 

- Internal promotions? Sorry, 7% is the max you can increase buddy ole pal. But for external candidates, anything for them. No problem, of course the external candidate that would have to spend 3 months on boarding and being hand held deserves the job and raise over the internal candidate thats already been doing it for less pay than the posted salary range. 

- Annual pay raise? Ya right enjoy your 1%, but please do enjoy your quarterly costco pizza party in the parking lot. 

- Pay employees a liveable wage? No thanks, we decided to invest in 20 new state of the art coffee machines instead! 

- I've still yet to meet a competent vice president. I'm convinced they fail upwards. But boy do they like yelling and whining and swinging their title around to make sure you know they're the VP, like we're supposed to be intimidated by it. (I can already smell the VP furiously typing in this comment thread to defend the corpo-ness-  ""you sound like a salty guy that isn't a VP.""

- How is everything simultaneously a fire and an emergency but also not, at the same time...all the time? And why does everyone simultaneously ""need it asap."" 

- Nobody accepts blame...like ever. Its always this weird office politics thing to deflect and deny and shift blame in a hot potato way to different departments. 

- VPs and Directors - Do you really need quotes in your email signature? Nobody cares for your Sun Tzu quote and it's lame and nobody is inspired. You just sound like a dork. 

- How are we simultaneously under-staffed, looking to hire, but never able to actually hire, because ""head count is frozen for this quarter"". 

- Why are promotions once a year? Dumbass idea by dumbass people. ""Idk why she left, I thought my gold star and pat on the back was enough to keep her around!"" 

- Why does every department have that one gossiping mouth breather that acts as the personal eyes and ears of management, as if it wins them brownie points. 

- Rules for thee but not for me. Higher ups can work from home whenever, take their kids to school etc, but everyone else apparently is sub-human and eats rocks and doesnt deserve exceptions in their schedule for their own families and kids. 

- Salary employees get treated like hourly employees. Why? who knows, ""back in my day...""

- You're not military and youve never been to war. Stop treating your excel spreadsheets and ad-hoc tickets like warfighting. Youre not saving lives by conditionally formatting your excel spreadsheet tracker. No we dont need to ""attack the trenches"" or ""run this battle drill"" on an IT ticket. 

- Everyone sounds like a chat GPT NPC. Synergy, synchronize, alignment, downstream, upstream, low hanging fruit, circle back, actionable insights, touch base, behoove, bandwidth, stakeholders, etc. ""Just to piggyback off what..."" 

- ""Everyone we're returning to office so we can continue our amazing collaboration and work culture!"" - CEO....meanwhile everyone is at their cubicle, not collaborating anymore than they would at home, drinking their .45 cent styrofoam cup coffee from the break room, staring with a dead expression at their computer screen, questioning their life choices, waiting until its 5:30 and time to go home.  

- You never know who you can trust. Your buddy buddy with one person and that same person will rat you out and twist your words to someone else. Its so weird. 

- ""Ya let's go ahead and focus on Q1 so we can look ahead to Q2 and on the horizon of Q3 once we synchronize our synergies then we can align our downstreams for Q4."" 

- There's also just so much passive aggressiveness. At least in the Army, when people had problems, they confronted it head on and then moved on. But in corpoland everyone is just two-faced and you cant get a read on anyone. 

- ""Were so proud to announce the company made/saved $25 million more!!! To celebrate, we're gonna have a raffle, you might even win a company backpack!"" - Oh so not a raise? Not any financial compensation? Cool cool. 

- ""Your schedule is yours, own it. But also, need you to attend all these meetings and still find time to do your work. Yes, I need you on every call.""

1qy4myx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qy4myx/should_i_tell_my_ex_about_how_our_kids_feel_about/,Should I tell my ex about how our kids feel about her partner and how it affects them?,"I have 3 kids. My daughter (26) with my first wife and two boys with my current ex who are now 16 and 18. We split about 8 years ago. My daughter lives abroad and my boys mostly live with their mom during the school year because it's more convenient but they do come over to visit me once I a while and we talk to each other everyday. I'm currently single and my ex met someone about a year after we split up and they have a 4 years old kid together. 

So. My daughter is currently visiting and  of course her brothers, along with the eldest's gf, came over for dinner and to spend the evening her as soon as they were done with school. It's a bit hectic for the first couple hours. I have to go get stuff at the store for dinner and cook it while my daughter and her brothers also head out to pick up donuts for dessert but we eventually sit down for dinner and start catching up and swapping stories. 

At some point one of the boys mentions something about my ex's bf being lazy and it's like a switch was flipped and the floodgates opened. They vented about him for a good 15 minutes, telling us how lazy, grumpy, selfish he is and a whole lot of examples along with it. He gets pissy if my ex doesn't have time to make his coffee in the morning (she gets up an hour before him to get her and the kid ready), how he constantly complains while doing his chores (which he does very little of apparently) or the time they were given a brand new tv by a family member because theirs was glitching and how it took him a entire year to finally setup after promising to get it done every couple of weeks. How he drinks beer, usually up to 2-3 am every night while watching sports on TV and how he always complains that he's tired. That my ex and him (and the kids) never went on a single vacation in 7 years because anything that requires even just one overnight stay is too much work for him. That my ex can barely have a social life because she has to come back home early in the evening cause her bf complains that their kid is too fussy when he has to do the night time routine and a whole lot more in the same vein. Overall, they don't like him and his lazy/selfish/grumpy attitude and they feel quite bad for their mom. 

My ex had actually mentionned a couple of these to me over the year. Not as a confidence but rather out of frustration during a conversation. I have a very good relationship with my ex but I wouldn't say we're friends so her telling me these things surprised me as she's usually a very private person and even if it was just a few times over the last 6 years. 

So, after they were done venting and the conversation moved to another topic, me and my daughter exchanged a look basically saying wtf just happened here? We discussed it later on, just me and her and we both expressed how surprising the whole thing was and how It was rather out of character for them to blow off like this since they don't usually share with me what goes down at their mum's, and the other way around has well. 

Now, I wouldn't be asking this question to the sub if it wasn't for the fact that my ex recently mentionned to me how stressed out and tired she was and how the family dynamic wasn't too good right now. Combined with the fact that my youngest complained to me 2 years ago that the bf had gotten angry and raised his voice at him, which is completely unacceptable to me so I did speak up at the time and as far as I know it hasn't happened again. Or at least not badly enough for my kid to mention it to me. However he is older now and he is able to stand is ground when needed. 

Finally, I know that my ex is aware that their is no love lost between the kids and her bf but given the exceptional and out of character outburst of my boys and the eldest's gf, I feel like I should speak up. I could just tell my kids to just move back here and step away from all that drama and negative energy but knowing them, they'll stick with her so she isn't robbed of the help she gets from them. Otherwise she'll end up basically doing everything. Which leaves my kid between a rock and a hard place and that doesn't sit well with me at all. Of course as a father my instinct is to protect my kids but it's not like I can tell her to dump him for my kid's sake. But on the other hand she is probably not aware of how our sons are affected by all this negativity, enough to break their well established pattern of privacy and keeping whatever goes on in our respective households separate.

I really genuinely like this girl and sobrang bagal ko or inconsistent din kasi.,"Problem/Goal: Really like this girl pero ang problem ko kasi di kami masyado nag kikita and pag dating sa messaging bihira lang din kasi di ko din alam sasabihin ko and wether I should keep messaging or much better ba in person nalang. 

Context: 29 M and she is 28 F, parehas kami new lang sa work, started last month tho siya naman is returnee. First night palang may evening meeting with client na and nung humaba meeting parehas kami nag crave coffee na wala naman sa menu ng resto so lumabas kami and nilibre ko siya sa cafe next door lang. Sabi niya utang niya daw sakin pero ako naman sabi ko libre ko na yun. 

After that pag nag bubump kami each other sa office lagi kami nag ssmall talk like kumain ka na ba or nag breakfast ka na ganun. Then a few days later tinext niya ako to confirm my number eh sa messenger and viber yung pang work namin. A few weeks go by puro small talk lang kami everytime we see each other.

Last week meron kaming company karaoke and billiards. Kita ko siya nag bibilliards pero di siya marunong nun, and pa onti onti she moves close to my spot tas dun ko na siya tinuruan. Na help ko siya by holding her hand nun tas naka ilang try kami bago siya maka shoot ng maayos. After nun na spot namin magka tabi na kami sa upuan then nag kwentuhan kami about personal stuff like previous work or ilang siblings, mga surface level stuff tas naalala niya din yung coffee utang niya and babawi daw siya. 

The next day nun weekend minessage ko siya. First time ko message na hindi work related tas ayun mabilis siya mag reply. Jinoke ko siya about dun sa coffee tas yun din sabi niya try natin this week. Hinanap niya din ako nun sabi niya bigla daw ako nawala, tho siya naman din yung unang umalis. Hanggat sa I cut the convo on a high, sabi ko see you next week and enjoy the weekend sabi tas ganun din sabi niya.

This week naman wala masyado movement, nung monday I had to leave early kasi may lakad ako nun so tinext ko siya nung hapon. Sabi ko sakanya wala ako sa office for a few days pero balikan ko siya sa kape tas nag reply siya na pa joke wag na daw ako bumalik. After nun di ko na siya na message for a few days then nung thursday nag message ako sabi ko punta ako office ganyan tas ask ko siya if g siya sa coffee sa friday she said check niya daw since uuwi daw siya nun. So sabi ko sure and I'll see her tomorrow.

Yesterday friday na and pagpasok ko sa office nakita ko na siya agad and nag smile ako sakanya and she smiled back. Di kami nakapag usap nun since busy sa work pero nung malapit na uwian na spot ko siya and I asked her if tuloy kami later, sabi niya check niya daw kasi marami daw siya labahin tas nag ask siya what time ako uwi nun sabi ko papalipas naman ako traffic. Time passed di na niya ako nabalikan, I figured baka nahiya lang din or genuinely busy siya. 

Previous attempt: Wala pa naman pero I dont know if dapat ba araw araw ako nag memessage na nag paparamdam man lang? May chance pa ba ako here? both kami single. Reason why di ako masyado nag memessage is because di pa naman kami super close and gusto ko sana in person kaso mahirap lang talaga sa office since di ako masyado nandun since lagi ako nasa field 2x or 3x lang din kasi ako nandun. Also magparamdam kaya ako later by messaging? may pagka torpe din kasi ako kaya ayaw ko talaga ma ruin to",2,1770439874.0,adviceph,2,1.0,False

Whether you're heading to **ABC**, **Poon Hill**, or **Langtang**, the mountains are a whole different world. Here is the Verve Nepal ""No-Nonsense"" checklist for a smooth first journey.

# 1. The ""Where to Go"" (and Where to Skip)

* **DO GO: Ghorepani Poon Hill or Mardi Himal.** These are the ""Gold Standard"" for beginners. You get the massive Annapurna views without the 15-day commitment or extreme altitude.
* **DO GO: Langtang Valley.** It’s close to Kathmandu, the elevation gain is gradual, and the culture is incredibly rich.
* **DON’T GO (Yet): Everest Three Passes or Manaslu Circuit.** If it’s your first time ever hiking, these are ""Boss Levels."" Start with a moderate trek to learn how your body handles 3,000m+ before you tackle 5,000m+ passes.

# 2. The ""What to Pack"" (and What to Leave)

* **MUST PACK: A Layering System.** Moisture-wicking base layers, a warm fleece, and a wind/waterproof outer shell. The weather changes every 30 minutes.
* **MUST PACK: Broken-in Boots.** Never, ever wear brand-new boots on day one of a trek. Your feet will hate you by lunch.
* **LEAVE BEHIND: Heavy Books & Jeans.** Jeans are heavy, cold when wet, and never dry. Use a Kindle for reading.
* **LEAVE BEHIND: Too many ""Just in Case"" items.** Every kilo counts. If you have a porter, be kind to their back; if you’re carrying your own, your knees will thank you.

# 3. The ""Do’s and Don’ts"" of the Trail

* **DO: ""Bistari, Bistari"" (Slowly, slowly).** It’s not a race. Walking slow is the #1 way to prevent Altitude Sickness (AMS).
* **DO: Drink 3-4 Liters of Water.** Hydration is your best defense against the ""mountain headache.""
* **DON’T: Drink Alcohol on the way up.** Save the Gorkha Beer for the trek back *down*. Alcohol dehydrates you and masks the symptoms of AMS.
* **DON’T: Ignore the Mules.** Always stay on the **inside** (wall side) of the trail when yaks or mules pass. You don’t want to be bumped off a cliff!

# 4. The ""Cultural"" Pro-Tip

* **DO: Respect the stones.** Always walk to the **left** of Mani walls (prayer stone walls) and stupas. It’s a sign of respect in Buddhist culture.

**Planning your first trek for March/April?** Swing by **Verve Nepal** in Thamel for a coffee! We can check your gear list, help with permits, or just give you the latest trail updates.

1qy4gvo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qy4gvo,Digital Article: Healthy Choices offered by fast food chains to become the next revolutionary innovation of the fast-food industry and the biggest one of the 2000s.,"Date: 2004 AD (C21st AD)

Publish Date: '04-07-26

In the year 1984, Wendy's birthed the catchphrase, ""Where's the Beef?"", with a mass popularity in fast food culture. 

Twenty years later, consumers may be wondering where are the buns, soft drinks and fries as fast-food chains tweak their menus to keep up with changing tastes. But are leaner menu choices leading to fatter bottom lines and less heart attacks?

For fast-food giants McDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King, the decision to offer salads and other health-conscious offerings has coincided with a general increase in quality and diversity. Grilled Chicken options, bunless ""sandwiches,"", low-carb platters, wraps, salads and fruit have all made their way to the major burger chains in storm and not just simply to satisfy dieting consumers.

""If you give a customer a good quality product, you can charge a premium price,"" says Janice Meyer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. The new offerings are also of higher quality than tried and true menu items, attracting those previously uninterested in eating at fast-food restaurants. Parents can now go to McDonald's and order a $6-$8 salad while their kids get a $2.99 Happy Meal,

After a few decades of struggling, the No. 1 fast-food firm is back on track, experimenting with a veggie burger with a soy-based patty, several salad options including a garden side salad and six salads served with warm crispy and grilled breast fillets, Atkins friendly low-carb platters for breakfast, lunch and dinner. and an ""Adult Happy Meal"" that will include an entree salad, bottled water and a Step-o-meter so ""consumers can track their daily steps.""

The enhanced menus seem to be paying off. McDonald's, which pre-reported earnings last week, today announced diluted second-quarter earnings per share rose 27% to 47 cents, while same-store sales were up a strong 7.8% for the quarter.

""We're increasing McDonald's relevance and keeping our brand in demand with faster service, better tasting and more contemporary food and beverage offerings,"" stated Neil Everett, VP marketing of McDonald's Restaraunts of Canada Limited.

The health-conscious trend began when McDonald's rolled out their ""Lighter Choices"" menu in early May 2002, about two years ago, later following up with Super-Size fry and options beginning to be phased out from locations worldwide earlier this year, A meatless Happy Meal option, the Grilled Cheese sandwich, was introduced in March of 2003, Healthier happy meal choices such as white and chocolate milk, apple juice and apple slices with lowfat caramel dip were introduced in April of this year and 3 low-carb protein platters introduced following the ""Healthy Lifestyles"" campaign in October of last year.

Wendy's didn't fare quite as well as Mickey D's, reporting that same-store sales rose 5.9% in the second quarter. Earnings per share were 62 cents, up 17% versus a year ago, in line with analysts' expectations. In June, it introduced milk and mandarin orange cup options for its Kids' Meal and is testing combo meals that offer chili, baked potatoes or a side salad instead of French fries, and ""carb counter"" meals, alongside a big sale in the Garden Sensations line, introduced in January 2002, with a limited-time Spinach Chicken salad rolling out in late February and a Homestyle Chicken Strips salad, topped with 2 strips of whole-breast fillet, being rolled out in late May/early June, The chicken strips are also available by itself in a 3-piece order, served with a choice of dipping sauce (which have been available by itself since late August/early September of 2003).

Which is the better investment? Wendy's is the cheaper stock with a price-to-earnings ratio of 17.15 compared with 21.36 for McDonald's. Wendy's shares are off 7.24% year to date while McDonald's shares have risen 11.4%. Both are trading lower today following their earnings news,

Burger King is the dark horse of the trio. Now owned by a private equity group, which includes Texas Pacific Group, Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the burger maker named Gregory Brenneman chief executive last week (see: [""Greg Brenneman's New Kingdom""](http://www.forbes.com/management/2004/07/13/cx_ld_0713bk.html)), their ninth CEO in 15 years. Brenneman is considered a turnaround guru after successfully rehabilitating Continental Airlines and PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting.

Since Burger King nabbed merchandising deals with two of the most popular movies of the summer, *Shrek 2* and *Spider-Man 2*, same-store sales have been strong, with those in U.S. franchises up 11.8% in June. following the launch of the Angus Steak burgers and the TenderCrisp chicken sandwich in February. But it could lose its No. 2 position to Wendy's if Brenneman doesn't come up with a plan soon or loses his Midas touch.

With the obesity blame game continuing and no quick fix in sight, the fast-food makers should continue to profit by offering more choices. CSFB's Meyer expects the big three of the chain, being Wendy's, Burger King and McDonald's to further expand their menu options to maximize the revenue-generating capacity of each franchise. So instead of saying ""supersize me,"" (following the launch of Morgan Spurlock's Super Size me documentary in January) consumers may be asking ""Got milk?"", 

McDonald's also improved their breakfast game with the Fruit N' Yogurt parfait, launched with the Lighter Choices menu in April 2002, the ""Cafe Roast"" coffee recipe blend in February of 2003, and the McGriddles breakfast sandwich, launched in April of that year, marking the first new breakfast offerings since the launch of the Breakfast Bagel sandwich line in 1999, the ""Deluxe Breakfast"" platter in 1997 and the ""Deluxe Roast"" coffee recipe blend in 1996.

Tom Vierhile has watched many such crazes unfold. As executive editor of Productscan Online, a Naples, N.Y.-based company that tracks new consumer products, he saw North Americans fall in and out of love with wine coolers in the 1980s; then it was foods containing oat bran; in the early '90s, clear drinks were all the rage. To Vierhile, it appears the Atkins diet and its low-carbohydrate knock-offs are heading down the same road, taking with them millions of dollars spent on development and merchandising by food giants that clambered onto the bandwagon just as its wheels started to fall off. ""It reminds me a lot of investors who around 1999 thought it would be a great time to invest in tech funds, and then proceeded to lose their pants,"" says Vierhile. ""The pattern is very, very similar.""

Indeed, recent surveys suggest Americans are starting to lose their taste for high-protein regimens and are switching back to less restrictive diets. (Far fewer carb-lite products have appeared in Canada, and industry representatives say the dieting trend is lagging by eight to 12 months here.) Last month, Kellogg CEO Carlos Gutierrez became the first major food executive to admit the industry may have overestimated low-carb's potential, acknowledging that the rapid proliferation of products had created ""a bit of a glut"" in the market. ""We're clearly seeing that the low-carb trend, or fad, has peaked,"" he told investors. That sentiment was echoed by General Mills chief Stephen Sanger, who said he didn't believe the diet would be a long-term factor in the industry. Just like those Internet start-ups that found themselves starved of capital and bereft of customers in 2000, food execs are now wondering what's in store for their huge investments in low-carb.

It's a business that didn't even exist a few years ago. Dr. Robert Atkins first published his revolutionary approach to dieting in 1972, but it didn't catch on until an updated version of the book hit bestseller lists in 1997 - and stayed there for almost 400 weeks. Soon, it seemed every other person was counting carbs and shunning potatoes, and the packaged-foods industry scrambled to keep up. In 2002, 339 new low-carb products were introduced in the U.S. In 2003, that figure almost doubled to 633. In the first six months of this year, the category exploded, with 1,863 products launched.

Dr. Atkins died in 2003, but the company he started, Atkins Nutritionals, remains a leader in the low-carb market. Last year, its sales of Atkins-branded foods and books more than tripled, topping US$200 million, and two private investment firms paid almost US$700 million for a majority stake.

A long list of companies whose products are loaded with carbs, from Krispy Kreme Doughnuts to Canada's bakery giant George Weston, have blamed the trend for disappointing profits and sales. Not surprisingly, many have rushed to get in on the revolution. Fast food chains like McDonald's and Burger King introduced high-protein platters with no bread. Kraft Foods, reeling from four quarters of falling profits, is cutting about 6,000 jobs and using some of the savings to promote lower-carb products. General Mills and Unilever rolled out entire low-carb lines. But almost as soon as all these products went on sale, executives started warning that the party was winding down.

HOLLY LEWIS'S experience with the Atkins diet helps explain why the low-carb trend is on the wane. The Toronto actor is by no means overweight, but she felt losing five pounds could help her get better roles. Seeing magazines filled with stories of starlets shedding pounds by gorging on meat, Lewis decided last fall to give Atkins a try. After reading up, she cut her carb intake drastically. She soon dropped a dress size and felt sure the diet was working.

Within a few weeks, however, she started having intense cravings for sweets and some minor stomach aches. But the most noticeable side effect was lethargy, and she was finding it more difficult to memorize lines. ""I read about the connection between carbohydrates and brain function, and that made me nervous,"" she says. Six months after she started, Lewis switched to a more balanced diet.

Research suggests Lewis is just one of millions of North Americans who embraced the low-carb lifestyle only to find it disappointing. Morgan Stanley analyst William Pecoriello commissioned surveys on the eating habits of 2,500 American adults in each of the last three quarters, and in the latest poll, completed at the end of June, the low-carb craze posted its first decline. The survey showed about 10 per cent of Americans were on a low-carb diet, down from an average of 12 per cent in the first three months of the year. Pecoriello forecasts that by year-end, the number will be closer to five per cent.",0,1770439401.0,AteTheOnion,5,0.07,False

1qy4dqq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qy4dqq,Coffee Appreciation Post: Shinzo by Kokoro,"I was a bit hesitant to buy this, especially because Kokoro doesn't sell D2C now (so no ""discount coupons""), but had to buy it from a café at full price, but now that I've brewed it - let me tell you - it is really good! It was a bit tricky to brew, especially with the DF54 (given the amount of fines it produces at finer grind sizes), but thankfully got it almost right in 2-3 brews with the help of Gemini!

Following Coffee Chronicler's Hario Switch Recipe (adjusted for 15gms):

**Ratio:** 1:16 (15gms in, 240gms out)  
**Water Temp:** 88 deg.  
**First pour (switch open):** 120gms in 20s  
**Close Switch** at 25s  
**Second Pour:** Remaining 120gms in 20s (finish around 45-50s).  
**Steep:** Steep till 2:15s.  
**Open Switch** \- Full draw down in about 30-35s, finishing around 2:50.   
**DF54 Grind Size** \- 70 (My true zero is about 5 points off the printed 0 - on the unmarked side).  


Really nice, vibrant coffee in which the notes became more prominent as the brew cooled a bit--nice peachy punch with a winey aftertaste. Just a hint of chocolatey bitterness towards the fag end, so might reduce the steep to about 2:05 just to see how it works.

Just wanted to ask to the wisdom of those who have been brewing longer than me: Do Indian coffees do better at lower temps (I've seen a few posts talking about)? The general idea is to brew medium roasts between 90-93 degrees. I did at 92, but that had a bit of roasty aftertaste. But this 88 is almost in the sweet spot.

1qy4dfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1qy4dfv/sketchy_job/,Sketchy Job?,"I worked at a coffee shop for about 2 months. I noticed my tips were the exact same on 2 checks. To the penny. So my thoughts were either this is some extreme coincidence or something sketchy is going on. 

While I recognize I should have just gone to the owners and asked about it, they aren’t around much and aren’t the most friendly people. I also recognize that companies stealing tips isn’t rare.

My coworkers happened to notice and were talking about it and genuinely curious, I asked the question “do you think they would ever take tips from us?” 

Well 2 weeks later I go in and get let go for “accusing them of stealing tips”. So my coworker snitched me out. Couldn’t this have just been a conversation with the owners? Firing me over this seems extreme?? I know it doesnt look good on my part. They also told me it was “a glitch in the system” and that they got a call from a customer saying I was talking bad about customers (im assuming because they cant legally fire me for accusing them of something?)

First of all, I havent even had a negative thought about a customer before because thats all they are to me - a customer. Second, when I asked what they said he said “idk I didnt ask for specifics”. Huh???? Wdym????

Anyway, i really need closure on this. It is killing me. Was this a glitch? Did I accidentally uncover something sketchy?? Should I have gotten fired over this even though my coworkers were the ones talking about it first? Should I have fought harder to keep my job?",1,1770439124.0,careerguidance,2,1.0,False
1qy4dfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1qy4dfc/aitj_of_ending_a_friendship_over_weird_petty/,AITJ of ending a friendship over weird “petty” things…,"So my friend “J” is 27F we both live in the same city and became friends about 2 years ago. Through out our friendship J has increasingly become erratic and emotionally high through the two years. Over the last six months I have really struggled with our friendship. 

I suppose I always have but it has mostly really come up in the last 6 months. I fully believe she has undiagnosed bipolar disorder, with her emotions and behaviour being so erratic that it’s just not anything else. A few other mutual friends have also suggested the same thing. I have gently asked J to seek therapy multiple times. As she has gone through a number of massive life changes recently and I also believe this is something that is contributing to the strain on our friendship, and also her families relationship, however I am always met with the same answer of “It’ll be fine,” and her never actually getting the help she needs. 

\- she has recently broken up with her long term partner of 4 years. 

\- she has lost her main source of income. 

\- she has moved out of the apartment she had been in for 2 years. 

\- a lot of family issues going around atm as well. 

So while I completely understand this might be an extremely venerable situation for her right now and she may not even realise she is doing these things. However her most recent behaviour and how she treats our group of friends and also men in particular I really don’t agree with and I can’t get by. 

Whenever we catch up and over phone calls she constantly talks so much shit about “A 27M” but also then asks if we can hang out in a group of 3 of us. 

Now I’ve meet A a number of times and he’s a nice enough guy, however every time we have plans or she wants to catch up she always asks to bring him along. 

They act all lovey dovey together which I don’t have a problem with, what I have a problem with is being a third wheel on the catch up that we originally planned and she’s now turned it into a date with her situationsiip. 

She has canceled multiple plans for this guy and other random guys for first dates or other dates. And frankly I’m over it. 

I’ve expressed my discomfort that she puts me in when I am around the two of them, to the point now if she asks if she can bring him I just say no or ignore it. 

This is what’s happened to our most recent catch up. We had plans to catch up before she moves away, I was keen as she has canceled our other three catch ups, but I again got another msg requesting if A could join us. Even though last week I again expressed my discomfort with him joining. 

Now again. A is a nice enough person however I’m also in a morally awkward position when I’m sitting across from him trying to enjoy my coffee that his “girlfriend/fling” talks a so much shit about him that I think I know more stuff about him than he actually wants me to know. 

It’s really put me in such an awkward position that now I don’t know if I am willing to loose this friendship or not. Honestly I don’t even want to see her half the time any more because I know how much shit she will talk about him and others and it’s just not enjoyable for me. Yes everyone vents and has girlfriend catch ups. But honestly I’m at my whits end with this one and I don’t know if I’m best to just let it fade out as she moves away or actually send a msg because I don’t think she realises at all how this is making me feel. 

Please help me out here, I’ve actually never been in this position before and I could use some advise from some bpd people or anyone in general. 

I have a carefully written msg that I was going to send to her but I’m just not sure if that will make things better or not.

1qy4bhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1qy4bhs/you_never_know_what_will_happen/,“You never know what will happen”,"Got that comment for the Nth time today. This time it was from one of my wife’s girl friends. People always say it with a wink or a knowing smirk.

The context is the question, “so, are you thinking about a second kid?”

My typical response is, “well, we’d \*like\* another, but I’m not sure if we are ready.”

Dear reader, “I’m not sure if we are ready” means “I don’t want to bring another child into a sexless marriage.”

Then comes the grin, and something akin to what my wife’s girl friend said to us at a coffee shop today, tongue in cheek: “You never know what will happen.” ;)

Yes, I know what will happen.

Nothing will happen. We don’t have sex at all. Zero. Nothing. Nada. I know exactly what will happen because unless we make one in a test tube, a baby won’t pop out of thin air.

Hell, my wife barely talks to me outside of necessary things like paperwork and logistics. I try to ask her about her day and half the time the answer is, “it was good.” That’s it. You see, we aren’t even at first base yet, let alone a home run.

I know her girl friend meant well, but it still stung.

People who don’t live in sexless marriages — where their entire life is wrapped around a contractual relationship that is devoid of intimacy — rarely understand. I can’t leave without my personal life collapsing and my standard of living decreasing, not to mention sacrificing substantial time with my son, who is currently a toddler.

I just bite my tongue and give a half smile. No laughter.",17,1770438962.0,DeadBedrooms,11,0.88,False
