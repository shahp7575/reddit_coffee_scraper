1gzz4ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gzz4ck/he_broke_my_heart_in_just_six_weeks/,He broke my heart in just six weeks,"I am 24F, I dated 29M for six weeks. It is crazy to think in the beginning, I was unsure - he was conventionally attractive, but not my type. However, I met with him as he was so interesting to talk to and we pretty much immediately hit it off. I was comfortable with him from the get-go.

I have limited dating experience. The only other guy I've seen, I was in a long-distance situationship with for an entire year (it was as bad as it sounds, and he did just want me for my body lol, but luckily I never gave it up). So this guy brought a lot of 'firsts' along with him into my life. He treated me so gently and kindly, of course I fell for him. He was the first guy I held hands with romantically in public, to come over to my apartment, to share a bed with for the night... He held me in his arms and ran his fingers through my hair, kissed my forehead, he cuddled me while I slept, let me lay my head on his chest, took me to get dessert just because he knew I like sweet stuff... And I did similar things for him, laying as still as possible because I know he has insomnia and he finally fell asleep while holding onto me, buying him coffee because I know he's tired. It was a short time, but we came to be attuned with one another.

However, around a week ago, after daily communication for a month and a half and a wonderful date the day before (our sixth), I woke up to be completely blindsided by a text saying that it wasn't anything that I did, but he has a feeling we're incompatible and we should see other people. I haven't been the same since. I've cried every day. How can I feel this strongly about someone I knew for less than two months? It felt like we were going somewhere. It felt like he liked me just as much as I liked him. He'd said it to me, too. He'd said, while looking into my eyes, that he likes me. And I believed him. But the next day he ended it.

I understand having doubts, but he never communicated them with me. He just decided they were too much and left without even properly telling me what they were. Why couldn't we work around it and adjust? Or at least discuss and mutually agree that there is an unfixable problem, so I wouldn't feel like I did something terrible to cause this? He wouldn't even come and see me to discuss anything in person, claiming it was 'unfair' to me. I can't cope with the idea that everything we said and did was a lie. It felt so real to me, and he has already etched himself deeply into my heart. I am struggle to come to grips with the idea that was the last time I'd see him and I didn't know, that I'll never kiss or hug him again, I won't fall asleep next to him again... It breaks me. While I had been involved with another guy for a pretty long period of time before this, that was very much an attachment/trauma bond. This time, it was true feelings - I felt so safe and I wasn't anxious. Maybe that's why I'm even more blindsided by how emotionlessly he discarded me.

I don't know how to progress after this. He is already seeing other people while I'm still as broken, if not more, as I was the day it ended.",1,1732582202.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1gzz3mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1gzz3mn/how_i_got_rid_of_my_sibo/,How I got rid of my SIBO.,"So, a lot of people have messaged me asking about my protocol. Figured at this stage it's probably easiest to just put it here for people to come back to. 

About three years ago I got rid of my SIBO. It took about two years to do it, and a LOT of trial and error.A lot.I've avoided posting for a while because in my experience any time I do it ends up with a lot of debate and arguments, and just to be perfectly honest that's not what I'm here for.I assume most people who get rid of SIBO leave these boards and likely don't come back, job done. As a result, a lot of the help is from people who still have it, or have 'done the research', or are trying to find people to come to their clinic (seen a lot of this lately, including a TCM practitioner who is using this board to find clients which is sketchy af) 

Not ideal. You need something that has worked. Not should work in theory.

The other thing I run into is a lot of questioning the rationale or attempts at retailoring/adjusting. This is a relatively new diagnosis. It is not an exact science. What works for one person may or may not work for another. My honest is, find a system that worked for someone, and try that. Don't reinvent it. Don't armchair expert it. Do what worked, or at least try it. And then if it doesn't work, abandon it.  
  
I once had the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever had at a party once, I asked the woman what her secret was. She said 'I follow the instructions on the box exactly to the measure. Why would I think I know more than the cookie people?'

I'm definitely not the cookie people. But I do have a method, it took a lot of work to get right. And I believe it needs to be done just right to work. I hope that it will work for you. Just to avoid argument I'll likely be muting replies on this at some point. But If you DO try it out, and need help, please feel free to DM me. All I ask that you try it this way first.

1: You need to get the mechanics right first. Before you can kill it. This is the most important single aspect of beating SIBO. If you start at part 2, you it won't work, because your sibo is coming back at the same time you're killing it.

What I'm going to try to get you to do is hyperdigest food. So much so that food goes through you easier and faster. We're not trying to isolate a specific issue. We're going to put your whole digestion into overdrive. Motility gets a lot of attention, but if food isn't digested well, it will move slower. The two go hand in hand.

This is primarily for Hydrogen, but it should work for the most part for methane. Methane is tougher, but this SHOULD make everything else easier once you've done it consistently for about a month.

I want you to get these EXACT brands.

1: Power Digest by Wholesome Health. This takes the place of like 7 other supplements I tried. It literally mimics digestion. Top to bottom. It is phased so it digests the way your body is supposed to, almost like an exogenous digestion. It's incredibly helpful. Take TWO with each meal or snak. As soon as you eat.They don't as of now offer international shipping, and the company is super tiny, but I bet if you ask them they would do it.

2: Spectrazyme Pancreatin 9x ES 1 with meals: the only downside to Power Digest is the pancreatic enzymes aren't enough. This stuff is like baby creon, it's pretty powerful and hits right when your body needs it.

3: Benfotiamine 150-250mg- 1 with meals: Increases motility, gastric acid, it does a lot. If you get tired the first time you take it, don't worry it will go away. Other forms of Thiamine work too, but Benfo just happens to be my favorite.

4: Zinc. Ideally liposomal 50mg- once per day. Codeage is a good brand. Low Zinc correlates to low gastric acid. 

5: Motegrity/Plucaloopride or Pyrodistimine if you have it. Take it how is best for you, some people find motegrity best 3-4 hours after eating. Some people right after. If you can't get either, and Artichoke/Ginger supplement like Gut Motility can help a lot, but it may run out of it's efficacy long term. The others should still help a lot, so hopefully this is just getting you from an 7/8 to a 9/10.

Try that, as written, on it's own for two weeks before adding any of the next pieces. Your SIBO will not go away. But keep very clear notes of whether you digestion gets even slightly easier.

If not, lets add based on your experience:

A: You feel like food is still getting 'stuck' and you're constipated.

Add Fibercon. This is not just another Fiber, it can't feed bacteria, and it will help get fluid into your intestines. So, it should make things easier to pass.

B: You still don't feel like you're able to digest... at all. Likely you have a bit of dysbiosis, you probably did a kill phase at some point, or an antibiotic that left you not feeling great. Get Kefirlabs Coconut Kefir, have about a third of a bottle after each meal. If it makes things worse, drop it right away. This is a 50/50 split- works great for some, not for others. 

C: You still can't eat some stuff.You can't go spend your life avoiding foods. If your car doesn't turn left, you don't just never take left turns. You take it to the mechanic and get it fixed. Based on which foods bother you most, go to Intoleran.com and try to find the one the works for you. Alternatively, Fodmate works great for many people in doing all of them.

D: You're getting gassy symptoms:Take Atrantil whenever you get symptoms. It will say to take it when you eat, just take it as needed, two at a time. This stuff is magic for gas.

If you're still having trouble, try adding another from the A/B/C/D category, it's tough to exactly line up symptoms to treatments. But try to stick to these temporarily.

E: You've tried ABCD exactly as suggested and they are just not doing it.Can you get pyrodistigmine or motegrity and add them in? If so, do it. If not, I may not have an answer for you. I deeply apologize. 

F: One last thing that helped me a lot: Intoleran's Starchway. I take one before bed and it feels like my gut goes into overdrive. Can't explain it for the life of me, but try it!

I would also HIGHLY recommend not eating within 4 hours of going to bed.

Now, likely you have ideally some improvement when you eat. Sibo is still there, but you have less difficulty when eating. (I hope, I got like a 70% hit ratio at this point. Ideally you're in the 70.) If you're not here, don't move to kill. I'm telling you it won't work. I would bet a lot of people reading have actually figured out their kill but because the mechanics are off, the SIBO is actually coming back at the same time they're killing it. If you haven't gotten your mechanics right, it will likely come back soon after or worse, it won't even feel like it's gone.

THE KILL:

1: The first thing I would try is EPC's Sustained Release Dehydroberberine.

The slow release makes it kill slowly and over time. It's powerful but it just stays in your system killing over and over. It's great stuff. It's not just berberine, it's the sustained release aspect that makes it so potent, I've yet to see another supplement work that way.

2: Next up: Xifaxin + NAC. Taking 1000mg of NAC each time you take Xifaxin makes it like crazy potent, at least for me. Cedars recommends this protocol as well, so there's def rationale behind it.

3: You're gonna tell me I'm crazy, but if you're getting here and you still aren't having success, try Kefir Labs Coconut Kefir- the amount of good bacteria in there can just wipe out the bad. It helps me on the rare occasion I get a flare up (normally I only get them if I eat super late before bed.) It's worked for a few people on these threads.

Lastly, there are the more extreme methods:

A: If you're open to it, Antibiotics will likely work. My two favorites are Alinia and Cipro. Alinia is a lot of things at once, but it's antibiotic qualities seem to be perfect for most SIBO. Cipro gets a lot of haters. Obviously talk to your doctor first, and you will need to to get it prescribed anyways. Yes, It has red label warnings, but then again so does Tylenol. It's frequently prescribed at hospitals and generally considered fairly safe except for those with tendon issues among older people. I suggest you decide for yourself by visiting the floxxies thread on Reddit if you're on the fence. You'll likely notice the lack of consistency in the symptoms people claim to have. I don't agree with the hate but again I don't want to argue, but  if you're really concerned about it Just Don't Take It. (easy enough!)

B: Just do the Elemental Diet. It works. Nearly every time. The thing is, you HAVE to have your mechanics figured out first. It takes a LONG FUCKING TIME, and it is awful. People say 2 weeks, I say it's more like three for most people to see success. You got to stick to it. The worst would be to go through all that and not have your mechanics figured out and have to do it again, so focus on that first and foremost. Oh, and you can have coffee. It's kind of the one little cheat. And if you get a decent tasting Elemental, you can put a little in your coffee too and it's kinda like sweet and low.

BEST OF LUCK. Feel free to hit me up if you need any guidance, all I ask is do part 1 first.",1,1732582142.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

She ended things over text, here the conversation, it’s been a week since I sent the last text. Should I send another message or just send her bra back to her?

Her: 
Hey. I’ve been doing some thinking since Thursday and I think I need to be honest with you and admit that unfortunately this just isn’t working. I’ve had the best time with you and do really appreciate you as a person and I’m sad it’s come to this. I just cant handle the lack of stability. As I’ve really tried to emphasise I’ve just moved to London and I don’t need the added pressure that I feel you have placed on me. If you want we can meet up and have a coffee next week to chat about it but for now that’s not much more I can say. I hope you understand. Lots of love xx

Me: 
Thanks for being honest with me. I’ve had time to reflect, and I get where you’re coming from.

You’re right, things were really good when we were together. There’s so much I like about you  and you’re beautiful, caring, and fun to be around.

The last week and a half has been tough, hasn’t been a great reflection of how we get on with you moving to (city) and me juggling interviews. I appreciate that you were doing your best to make things work for everyone and upon reflection that makes me respect you even more.

With that in mind, I’d really like to give this another try whenever you’re ready. It’d be a shame not to have someone to hang out with in (city) and (club).

That said, I’d still like to grab a coffee to clear the air it’s more constructive than a long text message and I should give you your bra back haha. Xxx

Her: 
Thanks for taking the time to reflect and write this! Appreciate all your kind words and hear everything u r saying. 

I think that’s the thing… with me moving to London the merge of us hanging out became extremely chaotic. I do think space is a good thing and having time to reflect on things always gives clarity. 

We can deffo meet for coffee and I for sure need that bra (although ugly it truly is the comfiest ahahahah). We can try and plan something for next week. 

Hope all is good xxx 

Me: 

I’m glad we’re on a similar page, time and space have been the best thing for us to reflect and reset.

I do like you and enjoy spending time with you, so I hope we can figure something out. Also you can’t go on not knowing what happens in band of brothers.

Next week sounds brilliant, I’m working every evening, and I’m guessing you’re busy during the days. The only days I have off are Saturday and Sunday if either of those work for you? (No pressure) 😉

It’s a shame to say all this on text so definitely looking forward to seeing you and giving your definitely not ugly bar back haha

1gzyw9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1gzyw9r/down_19k_last_night_at_13_nightmare_session/,"Down 1.9k last night at 1/3, nightmare session ","this is primarily a vent post. I am still in genuine disbelief. I beat my ontario geofenced 200nl for a moderate winrate, I have lots of hands and have experienced some fucked variance, but experiencing it live is something different… just wow. With that, let’s get started! 

started off the session 20 minutes in, had AA, got limp-raised by omc to 150, I jam, he has KK. He stands up on flop to leave, K on the river. Brutal, but whatever, happens. 

genuinely ten minutes later, I 3bet TT in CO vs a $10 HJ open to $35. He calls. flop is T8ss6d. He x to me, I notice this gentleman likes to raise vs weakness, so I bet 10 into 70. He raises me to 65 right away. I call. 
on turn, pot is 200. Qd, He bets 65 again, I raise to 180, leaving him $50 behind. He calls, pot is $560 on turn. He has 50 behind, river 9, any J is a straight, he donk jams 50, i just cry and call. 

He shows KJo. He raised flop with two overs + bdsd, got 90% of his stack in on the turn with >20%. He was almost dead on the flop, with 200 in the middle. Fucking brutal, but whatever, we move on. It rattled me a little since it was right after the AA hand, but I tried to get my mental back, continued onward. 

(this hand is perhaps my fault) 
straddle is on, i open T9s utg to 15. 5 calls. 75 in the pot. Flop is QJss7h, it checks around. Turn is a 7, so board reads QJss77. BB leads for 35, I put him on a 7, and flat because he’s a fish and likely to pay me off on rivers. HJ flats behind me. He seems regg-y.

river is 3c, pot is $180, board reads 
QJss773. BB leads now for 35. My thought process was that if the BB had a 7, he doesn’t bet like 1/7 pot on such a dry runout, and if HJ had a 7, he’s likely to raise on such a draw heavy board and with a fish in the pot. I decide it’s likely he has a draw, Q, or spades. I think the BB now likely has a Q that took a stab on the turn when it checked around previously, and is now betting and afraid of being raised. 

with that said, I was also still perhaps a little tilted. I raise to 200. HJ beats me into the pot, BB also snap calls. 

HJ has A7 for top trips that he flatted the turn with, and BB has a 7 as well. Well fuck. My reads were bad, but i didn’t hate my thought process, and thought that while it was probably not ideal, it couldn’t be too awful. 


next hand: Also likely my own fault. Chinese gentleman has been very action, he frequently straddles while shortstacked, then shoves when it gets to him with any ace/pp. The most he shoved for previously was 245 with A9ss. 

straddle to 6 is on, co opens 15, i 3bet btn to 45 with AQs, he cold 4bet shoves 290. CO folds. I had been raising a lot preflop, and the action player had previously remarked that I raised too much. So i thought that because he th inks i 3bet too much, i’d fold a lot vs shoves. The fact he shoved 250 with A9s, and with the straddle on making us less than 50bb effective, i reluctantly call. He tables KK, CO folded AK, no help is coming for me. 


later on in the night, i’ve rebuilt my stack to about 800 after stacking someone with a set. Fishy businessman type is the villain. straddle on, two limps, I raise the btn to 35. V cold calls SB, everyone else folds. I have KQo

flop is QT6r, pot is 82. he checks, i bet 40. He calls. 
turn is 3c, he checks again, i don’t feel like he’s very strong. I bet 120 into 162. He calls quickly. 
pot is 400. 
river comes the Ac. Completing KJ, which I block, flush draws, and any random AT type hand. Fuck. 
He thinks for a little, then donks for 55 into 400. I call. HE SHOWS AJo, for snap called gutshot, no club draw, nothing. 5 outs on turn, he rivers me for the pot. 

Next up, tighter older gentleman is the villain, i had not seen him bet for value a single time in two hours. 
I raise btn to 15 with QJo, he calls in the BB. 

flop is 3 TsKs

he checks, i bet 20 with my oesd and range advtg, he flat calls. 

turn comes the 9s, completing the flush draw, and giving me my straight. He checks to me, and I decide to bet a size that his Kx will continue, and that he will raise his flushes. I bet 20. He quickly raises me to 65. I debate folding on the turn, since i’m serious when i say he has not played a hand aggressively in two hours. I end up calling the 45 more. 

river is a blank, let’s say 2d. He bets out for 75. 

i have decent odds, but let’s be so fucking real everyone, this older guy with a coffee who x calls flop, then raises turn and bets river on a flush completer is NEVER bluffing. I just fold my straight. He instantly flips over his hand, says “good fold to you sir” I sigh in relief, until i see fucking 33 for bottom set. 

he flats the flop, then raises turn with his set on a flush and straight completing card. Are you fucking serious?

next hand, against him again, but 3 hours later. 

Btn and Sb limp, i’m in the BB with JTcc. I raise to 25. only same villain calls on the btn. Flop is fucking gorgeous. 

AQcc7s. I flop a royal draw, board slams my range. 

I x to him, as I do almost always in SRP, also because he occasionally limps strong. Online i’d bet this flop, but I like to check oop in all srp because bad players give off so much information. 

He reaches for chips, looks at the board a bit longer, then decides to check. I felt as though he had a Q or weak ace, but wasn’t certain. 

pot is 54. 
turn comes the Jd, board reads AcQcJd7s
i had plans to bet big, perhaps overbet most turns, but now that i have showdown value, I felt it wasn’t needed. I check to him again. he somewhat quickly bets 20. I call. 

pot is 94. river is an offsuit 3. 
AQJ73
i feel like he likely has an ace he checked back flop with, and wanted to go for value with afterwards. 

he bets 40 on the river. 

I know he can bet non nutted hands here since he was betting the bottom set previously, think he very likely has an ace, and have seen him fold two pair face up on river vs a different opponent. 

I block 2p combos with my J, I block the straight with my T. I think clubs are irrelevant here, because he’s never bluffing clubs regardless. I raise to 205, putting him all in. 
he beats me into the pot with KTo for the nuts. He actually assumed we had the same hand, and told me he’d fold two pair to that shove usually. I’m happy with my play here, Just less happy to run into the fucking nuts. Along with him needing a J and only a J to win this pot, which I block, and for no club to show up on river, was incredibly fucking tilting. No other sequence results in me losing a stack here. 

I lose QQ cs KK for 200 5 handed vs a shortstack. Not gonna go over that much, it was all in pre. 

I am tilted at this point, but trying to keep it together. I open 97ss on btn over a CO limp to 20. Only he calls. 

flop is T8ss4d. He checks, i bet 30. He snap calls. 

turn is 5c, i still have my open ended straight flush draw. he checks, i bet 120. He snap calls again. River is a Qh

board 

T8ssQh5c4d

he checks, and i give up blocking all his draws. He shows Q5ss for runner runner two pair, and a dominating flush draw. 

well fuck. Unlucky. 

and here is the crown fucking jewel, the hand that actually just made me want to give up. 

I open KK in the SB vs CO n BTN limp to 25. 

flop is QQQ. Awesome, right?

I bet 25, hoping to get raised. I have a loose bluffy image at this point, as they’ve all watched me lose 1k over two hours or so. 

all 4 players call. 

turn is 2d, 200 in the pot

QQQ2. I check first to act, hoping to check raise. it checks around. 

river, with 200 in the middle? Q.

QQQQ2. I have king high. I. Have. King. High. 

i check, BB bets, BTN raises, i fold. They both have an ace.


i did not play perfectly, I won’t pretend i did. But this was absolutely the most crushing live session i have ever played. I truly should have left earlier, I am embarrassed that I continued to rebuy. I should have called it quits. Down 1.8k total by the end when the room closed. I still can barely believe it. It’s so much harder hitting playing live and just losing for 11 hours. Don’t be too harsh, yes i’m aware poker is gambling, it’s part of the game. I am just venting because it was incredibly frustrating.

feel free to leave your opinions on the hands, I think the T9s bluff was not needed. 

thank you to anyone who read all the way! there’s lots of complaining in poker, so appreciate you reading even more!",2,1732581562.0,poker,5,1.0,False

Need help with itinerary and budget for those who have already gone. We'd really like to keep our budget small (below 30k if possible) since we're still trying to build our savings. 

1. Recommendations for travel to Sapa from Hanoi?
2. How much should we budget for food and coffee? 
3. Is 2 days 1 night in Sapa enough or should we go for 2 nights 3 days? 
4. Should we allot the whole day for travel between Hanoi and Sapa?
5. Pocket wifi/e-sim recommendations and how much? 
6. What to expect in terms of how easy it is to get around as a tourist?

The hotel is nice (used to be a Hilton Conrad). As a platinum I was upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite. They give $35 for breakfast credit for elite status members.

I researched this place heavily before booking and couldn’t understand why it was rated so low, however I understand after the check in process. It’s obvious they are working out the kinks still, the check in process was super painful with a long line stretching the entire lobby area and only 2 agents to do check in. Theres no elite line or even a fast track line if you’re just coming back to pick up your room key. We ordered breakfast in room; be aware they sneak in an automatic in room dining gratuity of 17% on top of a $10 delivery fee. I tipped on top of this (hadn’t had my coffee yet).
Disputed later.

The room itself was nice, spacious and comfortable. Theres a Nespresso machine and you can request a small mini fridge if you need it. Didn’t try the gym. Elevators were painful at times, seems a couple were out of service but they at least have a set of elevators for lower floors and a set for the higher floors.

I’d stay again, I’m sure long lines aren’t exclusive to just this property however I feel they have some work to do to get it up to the Luxury Collection expectation.",2,1732581543.0,marriott,0,1.0,False

Then, when the celebration began and everyone started coming in I started drinking with his mom. It started off fine until I poured myself one too many shots and got really, REALLY drunk. I did that thing girls do when they’re drunk and started spilling all my emotions about how much I love his mom for like 30 minutes. She listened and was reciprocating it but I think I went on for WAY too long, the only slightly assuring thing was that she was drunk too but it’s still so fucking embarrassing. I’m haunted right now. After that, in front of everyone I was trying to sit down but missed the seat and rolled on the floor, my boyfriend told me he was laughing but everyone else seemed concerned. I twisted my ankle but no one knew thankfully, I just remember being like “im fine guys” and sitting back down, didn’t make a big deal out of it at all. After that point I don’t remember anything I did at all except for trying to do tricks on a skateboard, but when I gained my consciousness back I just remember being hunched over the toilet vomiting a shit ton. My boyfriend’s cousin and sibling seemed so concerned, they made me a cup of coffee so I could vomit more but im just so fucking embarrassed. I don’t know what I did and I feel like everyone’s mad at me and that I ruined everything. When I woke up with my boyfriend in the morning I immediately started crying and asking him what I did and he said I wasn’t bad I was just “glazing” (basically being super nice) to his mom and I just started screaming from embarrassment. He just said I slightly gave him hell because he had to drag my black out drunk ass back into my house when he drove us home but I’m just so embarrassed. I want to shrivel up into a ball and die.

I thought I finally had an answer to the horrible hot flashes.  Unfortunately it didn’t last long.  I was very good about taking it at the correct time as I realized it was very time sensitive.  After a few weeks of worsening hot flashes (yes they got worse on Veozah) I cut out coffee and caffeine thinking maybe that was why my hot flashes worsened.  That sucked and it made no difference at all.  After 6 weeks I gave up.  I’m just relying on herbal tea (sage and raspberry leaf) and I giving the Happy Mammoth supplements a try.  I will say my hot flashes are improved but I think that is just because they are settling back to the pre-Veozah level.

The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield is one such book.

1gzytqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1gzytqg/he_broke_my_heart_in_just_six_weeks/,He broke my heart in just six weeks,"I am 24F, I dated 29M for six weeks. It is crazy to think in the beginning, I was unsure - he was conventionally attractive, but not my type. However, I met with him as he was so interesting to talk to and we pretty much immediately hit it off. I was comfortable with him from the get-go. 

I have limited dating experience. The only other guy I've seen, I was in a long-distance situationship with for an entire year (it was as bad as it sounds, and he did just want me for my body lol, but luckily I never gave it up). So this guy brought a lot of 'firsts' along with him into my life. He treated me so gently and kindly, of course I fell for him. He was the first guy I held hands with romantically in public, to come over to my apartment, to share a bed with for the night... He held me in his arms and ran his fingers through my hair, kissed my forehead, he cuddled me while I slept, let me lay my head on his chest, took me to get dessert just because he knew I like sweet stuff... And I did similar things for him, laying as still as possible because I know he has insomnia and he finally fell asleep while holding onto me, buying him coffee because I know he's tired. It was a short time, but we came to be attuned with one another.

However, around a week ago, after daily communication for a month and a half and a wonderful date the day before (our sixth), I woke up to be completely blindsided by a text saying that it wasn't anything that I did, but he has a feeling we're incompatible and we should see other people. I haven't been the same since. I've cried every day. How can I feel this strongly about someone I knew for less than two months? It felt like we were going somewhere. It felt like he liked me just as much as I liked him. He'd said it to me, too. He'd said, while looking into my eyes, that he likes me. And I believed him. But the next day he ended it.

I understand having doubts, but he never communicated them with me. He just decided they were too much and left without even properly telling me what they were. Why couldn't we work around it and adjust? Or at least discuss and mutually agree that there is an unfixable problem, so I wouldn't feel like I did something terrible to cause this? He wouldn't even come and see me to discuss anything in person, claiming it was 'unfair' to me. I can't cope with the idea that everything we said and did was a lie. It felt so real to me, and he has already etched himself deeply into my heart. I am struggle to come to grips with the idea that was the last time I'd see him and I didn't know, that I'll never kiss or hug him again, I won't fall asleep next to him again... It breaks me. While I had been involved with another guy for a pretty long period of time before this, that was very much an attachment/trauma bond. This time, it was true feelings - I felt so safe and I wasn't anxious. Maybe that's why I'm even more blindsided by how emotionlessly he discarded me.

I don't know how to progress after this. He is already seeing other people while I'm still as broken, if not more, as I was the day it ended.",2,1732581361.0,heartbreak,1,1.0,False

I've been with my partner for almost 8 years now. I didn't begin the relationship wanting kids (he already has one) or getting married.  
However,  somewhere around the 5 year mark my opinion changed, because I love my partner so much that he made me feel like I wanted these things with him.

I told him about it, and he wasn't completely against it, but that it wasn't the right time. I agreed, as I had only just sprung it on him and I understood he would need time to think about it, as our previous consensus was no kids or marriage. 

Fast forward 2 years, a LOT of things went down with raising his kid, a LOT of arguments (the mother is still in the picture).  Long story short, after clashing in parenting styles, I decided to back off and only guide the boy and not discipline him further than my house rules. This ultimately has put me off having kids with my partner completely, but also opened my eyes to just how much I do for him and how underappreciated I feel in return. 

We've been living together for going on 5 years. It is my house, I purchased it by myself before covid.

Anyway, the problems with the parenting and also being burnout at work and taking medical leave. I noticed he barely helps me with anything or does anything without me asking him. I would make sure he would renew his insurance, shave his head (he's bald), clean the house, the kitty litter, wash the cars, do the groceries, pay attention to details like his shampoo running out, you get the picture, also I would always either setup dates or things to do or placed to go, or remind him he hasn't taken me out in a while. (He knows that I prefer him showing he cares by doing things so I don't have to).

I'm not saying he doesn't do anything, but it's not the norm. Also he's NEVER cleans up after himself, he will only clean up after if I'm in the same room as him cos I'm watching.

So I told him he needs to take responsibility for his things and slowly handed things over to him and stopped doing them, to the point where he would forget to do certain things and get angry and ""blame me"", I say this loosely because he gets angry at the world and I'm the one who is there hearing the brunt of it and it's upsetting because if I had done what I usually would do, I wouldn't be in the situation.

Well, for the first year he would say ""oh, tomorrow i'll do x, or i'll clean y"" and the day would come and go and he wouldn't do anything of what he said. So it would only be when I got upset cos he set up expectations and then disappointed me so many times, that he would do it, or I would do it and be annoyed about it. 

I brought it up twice that year, that he needed to become more responsible and just clean up after himself. I only asked him to make the bed, flush the toilet and put his plates in the dishwasher. But the same routine would happen. He'd say he'd do it, would forget, I'd get angry, rinse and repeat. 

**So now here we are**, I started to resent him, and everything he doesn't do stands out like a sore thumb ""leaving his socks in the bathroom, his beard trimmings in the sink, his dirty bowl by the bedside table, coffee stains half assedly cleaned up....""

I sort of gave him an ultimatum and told him that I couldn't go on another year like this, because at this point I don't feel like he gives a shit about me or my requests. He retaliated saying ""wow, you gotta be shallow if you're thinking of breaking up over spilt coffee"" which just further shows he doesn't understand that it's not the cleaning up that's the main issue. 

  
Before living with him, my house was immaculate, I take such good care for my things, but all my efforts are ruined because he doesn't take the same care or minimum effort.

In one of our recent arguments earlier this year I told him he doesn't do anything for me anymore.  As a couple of examples I told him he never does anything special for my bday or that he complained I have a crappy pc for years, he would complainn we can't play together, but instead of buying me a new pc, he got himself a very expensive samsung tablet.

Anyway, one of his attempts to be more thoughtful, was taking advantage he had a dentist appointment on my birthday and that while we were out, we could dinner. e said. I really appreciated the initiative. He didn't have anywhere special booked. I brushed it off as he asked me where to go, I told him a place. But because it was 10mins walking distance he didn't want to go, so I said take me wherever then...

Now he's bought me a gaming PC and new headset and keyboards. Although I appreciate the gift, we're very tight on money and it wasn't the moment to splurge out, also I can't help but think that this was a result of my previous conversation... Additional note, my prior mechanical keyboard he took from me cos he spilt coffee on his, never replaced it. The headset he got me is red, I hate red.... he said it was what was on offer... great...

He is loving, he's very cuddly and kisses me and tells me he loves me. But now I can't help but suspect this is all just love bombing... I'm so confused! Specially cos I can't shake the feeling of ""when is he gonna get complacent and lazy again and revert back to his old self...""

Anyway, This is all my side of the story, and I may try to do an update with a bit more context, but the post is already too long as it is. I'm spewing a load of negatives because that's the headspace I'm in right now. I'm really trying to see his efforts as genuine care and concern on his part for the relationship. I just really needed to get this off and see outsider perspective. So thank you loads if you reached this far!

- 4 tablespoons cream mix (?) 
Add coconut

My main confusion comes from asking for cream mix, as I have no idea what that is referring to, or it could even be a typo and just be an instruction to mix. Anyone else got ideas?",4,1732580773.0,Old_Recipes,2,1.0,False
1gzylok,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1gzylok/the_baby_catcher/,The Baby Catcher,"His face was as pale as a murderous clown with washed-out rain-splashed makeup. It was thin like an underfed anorexic psychopath surviving on a diet of saltines and water. His eyes were sunken and dried with a lackluster finish across his pupils. They lay inset like old oysters on a yellowish bed of old sand with bright red veins. There was no nose to speak of. There was only a bump with two small holes that leaked mucus and breathed warm stale air whenever his deflated and shriveled mouth was closed. The sight of him was enough to drive anyone mad. 

That’s what I remember of him. That’s the image that is seared into my brain like burning on an old arcade screen from hell. I was only about 7 years old the first time I saw him. The time I genuinely regretted what I had done. As for any other bad things I did as a kid up to that point, I only regret getting caught and punished for it. I guess punishment is supposed to teach a kid to regret their actions, but most of the time we regret it if we get in trouble for it. 

If only I had listened to my parents. Billy would still be alive. Billy’s my brother–was my brother. He was only 19 months old when that monster took him. We never saw Billy again. As for my parents, they hated me for it. They blamed me for it. They were certain that I had something to do with Billy’s disappearance and the hatred that they developed for me, created a life with them that was worse than any punishment you could imagine. Worse than anyone could imagine. That’s why I’m here, in this prison cell. They did a job on me and screwed me up well. 

How it all started was that I had this friend Tommy, the new kid at school. He wasn’t the best kid to hang around with. He tended to do bad things. He always dragged me into it, whether I wanted to participate or not. So one day he comes over with this Ouija board. The cardboard Milton Bradley kind. He called it a game. I didn’t exactly know what a Ouija board was so if he said it was a game, and it looked like a game, I was game to play. The first time was uneventful. Nothing was happening, and I was disappointed. We kept accusing each other of moving the eyepiece or whatever you call it. Then we started arguing over it. 

My mother heard the commotion and immediately barged into my room trying to settle it all. She took one look at that thing and instantly flew into a range. She screamed at me for playing the game, though she never usually raised her voice at me. This time was different. She ranted and raved about how evil this game was and that it was a doorway to hell. She went on to tell me that if I played this game, I would be “opening myself up to the evil spirits.” I had never been so mortified in my life. The things she told me about what happens when people play this game, scared the hell out of me. I immediately apologized. She took the game and gave it back to my friend and told him to go home. She said she’d be phoning his mother very soon. He just smiled and said, “She already knows.” After that, he left. 

My mother then proceeded for another half-hour, admonishing me about the dangers of the Ouija board; and about how I could invite evil spirits to possess me and take over my body, making me do things that I wouldn’t otherwise do. She also whipped out a Bible and read from it various scriptures that admonished believers from resorting to witchcraft. My parents were very devout Christians. A little over-devout, you could say. Every Sunday was Sunday school, and every Tuesday evening was a prayer meeting, which lasted to and something beyond midnight. Every Thursday was Children’s devotion. You get the picture. Oftentimes it seemed like I saw the inside of that church more than school or my own bedroom. 

So, I spent the next 3 weeks confined to my room and tasked with doing a report on the Bible, book by book starting from genesis until however far I could get before my parents decided to relieve me of my pennants. I don’t remember how far I got or how many reports I wrote but it was quite a few. My hands were so sore from it all, I could barely do my work at school. 

After my punishment was over, my parents warned me against hanging around with Tommy. They swore he was the devil himself. I pleaded with them to let me stay friends with him but they refused. Day after day I tried getting them to let up but they didn’t budge until one day when my mom found out that Tommy was from a single-parent home. She started to feel sorry for Tommy. Then one day she asked me to invite Tommy and his mother over for dinner. So I did, and they came. The dinner went well. My parents and Tommy’s mom seemed to get along pretty well. I was quite happy about that because I figured now they would let me and Tommy hang out again.

After dinner was done, My parents and Tommy’s mom were sitting in the living room talking. Then mom brought up the Ouija board incident. Tommy’s mom didn't flinch. She was completely unconcerned. This floored my mom. She couldn’t believe that Tommy’s mom didn’t have the same reaction that she did. Tommy’s mom explained her side of things. She said it wasn’t that bad of a thing. That it was just a game some people play and that all the “hooey-phooey” surrounding it was just a bunch of superstition. My parents strongly disagreed with her and things started to heat up. Then, however, before it all got out of hand, Tommy’s mom agreed not to let Tommy bring it over anymore and not to let me play with it if I was over at Tommy’s house. My parents accepted the compromise.

I was happy again because I got to hang out with my friend again. Although Tommy was upset about the arrangement regarding the game, he was glad that we could be friends again. All’s well that ends, right? Wrong! I’ll tell you why. It didn’t just end there. 

You see, ever since my mother went on her tirade about that game, and she told me all the neat things that could happen with it, I was intrigued. I was hooked. Seemingly, all I could think about. I wanted to see that eyepiece thingy move by itself. I wanted to see if any disembodied shadows appeared in the corners of my room. I wanted to know what was so evil about a game made by Milton Bradley.

One day I was over at Tommy’s. We had just finished playing Checkers, Go Fish, and, I think, Candyland. We were both bored to tears with those games, and the after-school cartoons were over already. I asked Tommy to bring out that Ouija board. He was reluctant at first because he didn’t want me to get into trouble like that again, but I insisted. He thought about it a moment then said, “What the heck. Mom’s not due back for another hour.”

Tommy snatched the game down from the top shelf and opened the box sending the box top flying across the room. We started the game. I started getting a little belligerent because, again, nothing was happening. So I got a little aggressive with the questions I was asking. I started to get snarky and asked questions like, “What’s it like in hell?” or “What’s the devil like?” That did something because all of a sudden, every single toy, book, or trinket on Tommy’s shelf started to rattle. Some things fell to the floor. 

When they stopped, Tommy and I looked at each other, speechless. Then we burst into a celebratory yell, “Yeah!” While we were celebrating the fact that we actually made something happen, there was a sudden scream. It was as loud as a lion’s roar and sounded like there were ten of them in the room on all sides of us. However, there was nothing there. We were again, silent. Tommy was about to say something, but I stopped him. I was so afraid by then, I didn’t want to make another sound or move a single muscle.

Then we both felt a presence in the room. It was like nothing we’d ever experienced before. We were both so scared that we each scooted a little closer to each other. There was a sense of comfort at that point; not much of one but some comfort to say the least. Then we saw a dark shadow start to form in the corner of the room. Just as I was initially expecting to see. I remember thinking, “Now I’ve seen it. I don’t wanna see it anymore.”

Tommy pointed it out and when he did, I swiped at him as if to try and grab him. We both screamed. Then it was gone. The room was quiet then. Nothing moved, not a toy, not a book. Tommy’s clock had even stopped ticking. After a minute or so, the ominous feeling of dread we felt started to fade. The place felt normal again. Tommy and I agreed never to play that game again. Little did we know that the game would be playing us–Playing me. 

The phone rang. Seemingly out of nowhere. It startled the both of us. Tommy answered it. It was my mom calling for me to come home. He said she sounded scared. Confused, I gathered my things and headed out the door. I only had to walk a couple of blocks to get from Tommy’s house, but it was the longest walk in my life, it seemed. Every few houses, I’d get a strange feeling that I was being watched or that someone was following me. Periodically, I’d turn around to see, but there was never anyone there. Then the feeling would fade. 

When I got home, Mom was there waiting for me. She stood in the doorway of the kitchen holding my baby brother Billy. She looked worried. 

“What’s wrong, Mom?” I asked. 

“Nothing, I just had a bad feeling. I wanted to make sure you were okay,” she explained. 

“I’m okay, Mom,” I replied. That seemed to satisfy her for a bit. Then after a brief pause, she asked, “Have you been playing with that devil board?” she shot a new question at me with an almost accusatory tone. 

“No, Mom. I haven’t,” I answered. 

“Are you sure?” she pressed.

“Of course, Mom. I’m sure.” I insisted. 

Reluctantly she accepted my answer and then told me to go get cleaned up for dinner. So I did. 

While in the bathroom, I heard her call out to me. Her voice sounded rattled and afraid. I raced downstairs to see what was the matter.

“What happened?” I asked worried and scared. I found her standing in the middle of the kitchen. She was shaking. When she saw me she lunged at me with such speed it scared me. I tensed up expecting her to run over me. Then I felt her arms wrap around me squeezing so tightly that I could barely breathe. Again, I asked, “what was the matter?” She said she had another bad feeling but was stronger this time. She questioned me again about the game but I assured her that I was not playing the game. 

Later that night, I was lying in bed, unable to sleep. There was a tapping sound coming from my closet. Being 7 seven years old, and after having experienced what I and Tommy experienced that day, I was not quite brave enough to investigate. So I laid there in my bed with the covers pulled up to my chin,  listening to the sound, hoping it would stop. It went on for about fifteen minutes, continuously and unrelenting. Then, I remember hearing breathing. It was faint but it was there. It was slow and drawn out, and it was wet sounding like someone was drowning in their own fluids.

I laid there motionless and silent because if I moved or made a sound, it might get me. That was the logic of a seven-year-old, but it made perfect sense at the time.  Then the closet door started to creep open all by itself. It moved slowly but constantly. The hinges creaked a long drawn-out “creeeek” as the door crept open.  There were no strings attached to it. There was no wind, and no one inside the closet. At least no one that I can see. When the door was open far enough to reveal what was behind it, all I saw were my clothes. 

Then, just as my eyes fixed themselves on the light and dark shapes among the clothes in the closet. One of the shapes started to move and grow. At least it looked like it was growing. Then after a second, I realized that it was not getting bigger but getting closer. When the shape got close enough to pass through the light that beamed in through my window, I could see its face. It was hideous and horrifying. Just as I described in the beginning. I was so terrified by the sight, I was rendered petrified and unable to scream. 

The thing got close up on me, and I thought it was going to eat me or something. It started sniffing around all over me. Then it started sniffing around the room. I couldn’t figure out what, but I got the sense that it was looking for something. Then it stood up straight and paused. It was like it recognized something. Like it found what it was looking for. Then it grabbed the doorknob on my bedroom door, swung it open fast, and walked through, leaving the room and slamming my door behind it. 

My parents heard the door slam and came running. They were sure I was up playing around past my bedtime. They burst into the room and my Dad asked “Why’d you slam my door?” 

 At first, I was going to tell them what happened and why the door slammed but then it occurred to me that if I did, they would, either not believe me, or they’d know I played the game again. So I lied and said that I went to the bathroom and slammed it on accident. Reluctantly my parents believed me. Mom still thought something was wrong. She got one of those bad feelings again for a moment. I could tell by the way she had her arms crossed and the look on her face was one of hesitation.  Eventually, they relented and went back to bed. 

“Alright son, get yourself to bed and go to sleep.” he said. “And no more creeping around at night.”

“I just went to the bathroom,” I argued.

“I know, but just get to bed,” Dad 

 The next few days were relatively normal. I didn’t see that weird shape in the closet. There were no shadows and now eerie feelings. Just regular days. The only thing I remember about those days was that my baby brother Billy was really irritable and cranky. More so than he’d ever been. My parents thought he may have been sick so they took him to the doctor. Little Billy came back with a clean bill of health. My mom found it odd that he had been so calm and manageable while at the doctor's. Now that he was home, his discomfort started up again. Other than that bit, everything was fine. 

Tommy and I talked about that day we played. He said that he saw something move past him in his hallway about the minute after I left. Although, he wasn’t able to make out a face or anything. He said it seemed to move so fast he barely saw it. Aside from that, he didn’t experience anything weird after the game. 

The next week, I was looking forward to another day hanging out with Tommy, when my parents told me I couldn’t go because they were going out. Janice the babysitter was coming to watch us. Disappointed, I ran to my room and shut the door. Then the door opened by itself. When she got there I didn’t want to come out of my room. Janice was a nice girl. She didn’t get on my nerves or complain about me getting on hers. We pretty much got along ok. I was just upset that I couldn’t go over to Tommy’s. She tried to cheer me up with ice cream. It worked. 

We sat in the living room with our ice cream and watched a movie. It was an old horror from before I was born. So the acting was kinda weird and cheap. So were the special effects, but it was still ok to watch. 

“Promise you won’t tell your parents I let you watch this, okay?” she said.

“I promise,” I answered. 

“I like watching you guys,” she exclaimed. Then she picked Billy off the couch who was sitting next to her. “I really like looking after you!” she squealed in that silly baby-talk voice people do. 

I just rolled my eyes in disbelief, “Oh good grief!”

Then Billy’s sippy cup shot from the coffee table across the room and hit the wall just above the T.V. Janice and I stopped everything. Billy tore into a crying fit. His voice was so piercing, I had to cover my ears. Janice tried to calm him down but it was no use. He was not stopping. She started carrying him around the room with gentle bounces trying to get him to shut up and then furniture started to move around the room. 

Janice got so scared that she put Billy down, grabbed her things, and shot straight out the door. Leaving me and Billy by ourselves and leaving the door wide open.  So it was up to me to take care of little Billy. 

“Okay, Billy, we gotta get out of here,” I told him. Then I took him by the hand and tried leading him out the front door. As we approached the door, it slammed shut and I couldn’t get it open. I struggled with it for a minute, and then I started hearing the lion’s roar. Billy’s crying got more intense. I picked him up and looked around to see what was there with us, still trying to calm my little brother down. 

“Shhh! It’s gonna be okay,” I consoled him. There was no stopping him, though. “Okay we have to get out.”

I headed for the back door but it was stuck just the same. Now trapped in the house with whatever was making that noise and moving the furniture around, I ran with Billy upstairs and we locked ourselves in my room. I shoved Billy under the bed to hide him, then I leaned against the door hoping to keep out whatever it was that was after us. My legs started getting tired and I was having trouble holding myself against the door. 

Finally, my legs gave out and all I could do was sit there on the floor, leaning with my back against the door. Then, there was pounding, like someone was ramming themselves against the door. All I could do was to press my hands down on the floor to apply as much pressure against the door keeping it from opening. I held that position for so long, my shoulders and arms became fatigued, and the burning got to be too much. I had to take a rest. I was tired and out of breath, and my little brother would not stop crying. The world around me became like a dream. I couldn’t believe this was happening. 

“Shhh! Billy, you have to be quiet.” I said. But it was no use. He was blaring like a siren. There’s no reasoning with a two-year-old. When they’re in discomfort they’re in discomfort. I didn’t know what to do at that point. I remembered a song that my parents taught me, “Yes, Jesus Loves Me.” I started singing it. Then the banging stopped and Billy stopped crying. 

The room was now very quiet. I was able to think now, regain my bearings. I sat there for a time, resting, and thinking. I pulled Billy from under the bed and held him close. Then I heard my parents come home. 

They saw the mess downstairs. That all the furniture had been moved around. They called out to me, wondering what had happened. I immediately got up off the floor, and took Billy by the hand and ran downstairs. They asked all the obvious questions like, “What happened to the furniture?” and “Where’s Janice?” At first I was going to lie to them and tell them that Billy and I were playing and we moved the furniture ourselves. I was going to tell that Janice left after we’d done this because she didn’t want to get into trouble for not keeping us in line, but I didn’t want Janice getting into trouble for something that was my fault. Not to mention, I figured I could handle getting punished for disobeying Mom, I just wanted my parents to keep me safe from whatever it was that moved all the furniture around. So I told them the truth. 

“I told you not to play with that board!” Mom screamed. 

“Why are you so hard headed?” Dad interjected. 

Yeah, I got a tongue lashing of a lifetime, and I got punished for it. More Bible reports. This time I had to do the whole Bible. My punishment did not end until I had written a report on every single chapter of the Bible. It got to the point that I came to despise that book. By the time I had finished all the reports, I felt as if that book was written specifically to punish me. 

When it was all over and done, I was then released from my imprisonment in my room. It was like being freed from slavery. It had been six months that passed during my punishment. I was officially banned from hanging around Tommy. This time it didn’t bother me as much. Even though the whole idea of playing with the board was mine, I figured it would be best not to even be in the position to be tempted. 

I would like to tell you that the six months I spent on punishment were uneventful, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.  Every so often, I would see that thing coming into my room or slinking out of my closet. I dared not tell my parents or they would extend my punishment. Who knows how they’d react if they knew that our house was now being visited by something demonic, and it was all thanks to me. So I kept that part from them. I just endured the terror of watching this “Thing” emerge from my closet on an almost nightly basis. I just sucked it up as something I deserved. Things weren’t exactly pinwheels and pixie dust for Billy, either. Because every time that thing showed up, Billy would go into one of the crying fits. It often took hours to quiet him down. 

One night, it got really bad. I saw that thing again. This time, something was different. His actions were more aggressive. I laid there in the bed, watching him as usual as he came out of my closet. His breathing was–elevated. His motions were jerky and violent. I was never more terrified in my life. He crept over to me in my bed, sniffing and snorting around as he did before.  I dared not say anything or move at all. He grunted and growled. He seemed agitated and angry, again like he was looking for something. Then he stood up and shot out of the room. He swung my bedroom door open with such force the door hit the wall and the doorknob left a big hole. 

There was a feeling I got at that moment. A feeling that leaves you unsettled, like something was bad was about to happen. I immediately thought about Billy. I jumped out of my bed, screaming and calling for my parents. I tried to chase that thing down the hall and ended up at the doorway to Billy room. My parents came out of their room, startled and alarmed by my yells. They found me standing there, staring at an empty crib. Billy was gone. There was no sign of him. 

My parents called the police, but there was no sign of any break-in. No sign of anything that could give them a clue as to what happened to my little brother. He was just gone. That was the night that my parents learned to hate me. 

As the years went by, Billy was never found. My parents started blaming me directly for his disappearance. From that point, they treated me like shit. There were no more Christmases and more Birthdays. There were no happy days. My Dad would often tell me that the only reason they kept me around was because it was their God given duty to raise me since I was their progeny. Some days I was sure my father wanted to kill me or at least wish I were dead. 

Dinner was somber and cold. My mother would set my plate in front of me, oftentimes, after they were already halfway through their meal. So my food was often cold and likewise dull and bland. After a while, I became numb to it all. It was all life as usual with the people that were tasked with caring for me. That’s what our relationships had been reduced to.

So that’s how the rest of my childhood went. No love, just hate. There was nothing but disdain in either direction. By the time I turned 16, I became rebellious and angry. I started getting into trouble at school, and eventually not going to school at all. I found drugs and alcohol to be a comfort. Then there was Tommy. He was a natural rebel, since we were kids. We ran the streets, looking for trouble and whenever we weren’t looking for trouble, trouble still seemed to find us. 

My parents eventually kicked me out of the house. I had to make my own way. Jobs were hard to keep, and I had to make ends meet somehow. So me and Tommy did a lot of things that any decent person wouldn’t agree with. We robbed corner stores, stole from grocery stores, and mugged people when the opportunity arose. After a while, things got really tough. I was tired of living hand to mouth. Tired of robbing and running and then subsequently laying low. I got to be too much. I started to resent Tommy for ever having brought that board into my life. I blamed him for what happened to Billy. Tommy tried to reason with me and explain that he had no idea my Brother would disappear as a result of a “game.” His “excuses” angered me. I grew furious and one night flew into a rage. I killed Tommy that night. 

I stabbed him in the gut. After that, I cut him up into little pieces and scattered those pieces across several parts of town. The police eventually caught up to me. I was sentenced to death as a result. So now I have to sit in here and rot until they kill me.

1gzyjeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gzyjeg/aitah_for_being_spoiled_when_it_comes_to/,"AITAH for being ""spoiled"" when it comes to Christmas gifts?","I (20m) do not like the holidays. It's nothing but stress and trying to figure out what to buy everyone. It's nice to see my dad's side of the family, but my mom doesn't talk to her side of the family anymore (my parents split up and I live with my dad). But I still get texts from random relatives on my mom's side asking what I want for Christmas. It's sweet and I really appreciate the gesture, but since I never see them, I feel a bit guilty about it. So I usually say they don't have to worry about getting me anything, to which they'll respond, ""oh don't be silly of course I'm getting you something"" so then I just sent them a link for something cheap on Amazon or ask for a gift card. 

Normally this works out well but this year my grandma texted me asking what I wanted, and she seemed really off. She ended every sentence like this??? And when I asked her why, she said it was because I wasn't answering, even though I had answered all of her messages right away. I haven't seen her since she moved to a different state, but I know she has a history of alcohol and drug abuse, so maybe that has something to do with it? Anyways, I sent her some ideas and she seemed to get mad and was like, ""really, that's all you want?"" I said yeah, but she insisted I give her ideas for a bigger gift. 

So I thought about it and sent her a link for a coffee table I had found on Amazon (I still wanted to keep it relatively cheap, so the one I chose was around $50). She seemed to be happy, but the next day I got a text from my grandpa calling me spoiled and asking how I could expect such a big present from my grandma even though I don't talk to either of them. I told him that I had originally said that she didn't have to get me anything, and to read the texts between us. I haven't heard from him since, so I'm hoping that's the end of it, but I'm still half expecting it to blow up into this big thing. AITAH?",1,1732580559.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

The problem is that it's going to rain almost the entire time I'm in Colombia. In Bogota and Medellin I can still do things indoors but I’m concerned about spending 3 days in Salento where there are thunderstorms and heavy rain. My plan in Salento was to hike Cocora valley, bike in Filandia [explore cafes/coffee], and do coffee/cacao tours. Now I am considering replacing Salento with flying to Cartagena because of the weather i.e. day 1 [explore the city and fly/take bus to Santa Marta], day 2 [Tayrona], day 3 [Tayrona + flight to Medellin]. What do you think?

A little about what I want: I enjoy museums, art, architecture and making workshops. I love the outdoors; hiking and water activities. But I do want to take this trip a bit slow and not exert myself too much. I decided to skip Cartagena initially because I didn’t have enough days for Tayrona, but now if I’m skipping Salento I could do it.

I’ve already made a couple posts on r/nosleep and here’s one of them maybe I can get some feedback from some of y’all tell me what you think. So here in THE CABIN THAT WAITS

I thought it was a great deal at first.
I’d been scrolling through rental listings for a quiet getaway when I found it: a cabin deep in the woods, miles away from anyone else. It was advertised as “a rustic retreat for writers and dreamers.” The photos showed a small, weathered structure with a cozy interior—nothing fancy, but charming in its simplicity.

The price was ridiculously low, almost suspiciously so, but the reviews were glowing. People talked about how peaceful it was, how the isolation helped them “find themselves,” and how they couldn’t wait to come back. It sounded perfect.

The drive was long and the directions vague, but I eventually found the gravel path that led to the cabin. When I arrived, the first thing I noticed was that it didn’t look quite like the pictures. It was the same cabin, sure, but the boards were darker, more warped, and the windows looked like they hadn’t been cleaned in years.

There was also a note nailed to the door.

“Don’t open until you’re ready to take their place.”

I laughed nervously. It had to be some kind of quirky guestbook thing, right? A rustic touch for an isolated retreat. The padlock on the door matched the instructions I’d been emailed, so I unlocked it, stepped inside, and tried to settle in.

The first night was uneventful, mostly. The cabin was quiet—too quiet. I’d expected to hear crickets, maybe the distant hoot of an owl, but there was nothing. Just the faint creak of the wooden beams and the occasional gust of wind.

It was peaceful, though. That’s what I told myself as I made some tea, curled up in the rickety armchair, and started reading.

The second night, things started to feel… off.

It was little things at first. My notebook, which I’d left on the coffee table, was on the counter instead. The front door was unlocked when I swore I’d bolted it. And then, while I was brushing my teeth, I thought I heard something—a faint knocking sound.

It stopped as soon as I opened the bathroom door.

By the third night, I couldn’t ignore it anymore.

The knocking was louder now, deliberate and insistent. It didn’t come from the front door or the windows but seemed to echo from within the walls. I tried to ignore it, pulling the blankets over my head, but then it came again—three slow, deliberate knocks.

I shouted, “Who’s there?” but the only response was silence.

The next morning, I decided I’d had enough. I packed my things and went to leave, but when I opened the door, there was another note nailed to it:

“You’re not ready yet.”

The gravel path I’d driven up was gone. In its place was an overgrown trail that led deeper into the woods.

I slammed the door shut and tried calling for help, but of course, there was no signal. I even tried the old landline phone mounted on the wall, but the line was dead.

I was trapped.

The days blurred together after that. I stopped keeping track of time, mostly because it felt like time had stopped altogether. The knocking grew more frequent, sometimes even during the day, and I started finding more notes.

“Stay longer. You’re almost ready.”
“They’re waiting for you.”

One night, I woke up to the sound of footsteps in the cabin. They were slow, deliberate, pacing back and forth in the living room. My bedroom door was locked, but the handle jiggled as if someone was testing it.

I whispered, “Who are you?” but there was no reply. Just a low, guttural sound that sent chills down my spine.

When I finally mustered the courage to open the door, the living room was empty. But there was another note on the coffee table:

“You’ll take their place soon.”

I don’t know what they mean by “their place,” but I’m too scared to find out. The cabin feels alive now, like it’s watching me, waiting for me to make some kind of decision. Every time I try to leave, I end up back here, like the woods are circling in on themselves.

The knocking didn’t stop. It came at all hours now—mornings, afternoons, nights. Always three deliberate knocks, always from a different part of the cabin. The walls, the ceiling, even the floor. I searched for loose boards or animals, anything that could explain the noise, but the more I looked, the more absurd it felt.

Because the knocks weren’t random.

They came whenever I thought about leaving.

I tested the theory the next morning, standing at the front door with my packed bag. The second my hand touched the doorknob—

Knock. Knock. Knock.

It came from right behind me, from inside the kitchen. My stomach dropped. I’d been standing in the kitchen just seconds ago, and there had been no one there.

I turned, shaking, but the room was empty. My eyes landed on the coffee table.

Another note.

“Leaving isn’t part of the deal.”

What deal? I hadn’t agreed to anything. I tried shouting into the empty room. “I don’t know what you want! Just let me go!”

The cabin didn’t answer, but the knocking stopped.

For a moment, I thought it was over. The silence felt so complete it was almost comforting. I let myself believe that maybe I’d passed some kind of test. Maybe I was free to go now.

And then I heard footsteps—soft and deliberate, like someone walking barefoot on the wooden floorboards.

But they weren’t coming from inside the cabin.

They were coming from above.

I stared at the ceiling. There was no second floor, no attic, no crawl space up there. Just the roof. I tried to convince myself it was an animal, maybe a raccoon, but the footsteps were too steady, too human.

I grabbed the flashlight from my bag and stepped outside, scanning the roof. Nothing. The cabin looked the same as it always had—old, dark, and empty.

Then I felt it.

A presence.

Someone—or something—was standing just behind me.

I froze, too scared to turn around. My breath was coming in short, panicked bursts, and I could feel my pulse pounding in my ears. Slowly, I shone the flashlight over my shoulder.

There was nothing there.

My chest heaved as I tried to convince myself it was my imagination, but the flashlight’s beam shook in my hand. I turned back toward the cabin, and my stomach flipped.

The door was wide open.

I had shut it—I was sure of that. The heavy iron latch was loud, impossible to miss. And yet, now the dark interior of the cabin stared back at me, its gaping doorway like an open mouth waiting to swallow me whole.

The knocking started again.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

This time, it was faster, more insistent. It wasn’t coming from one place anymore. It echoed from everywhere—inside the walls, under the floorboards, even from the trees surrounding me. I stumbled back, dropping the flashlight, its beam spinning wildly across the ground.

I thought about running, about sprinting as far as my legs could take me, but then I heard it:

A voice.

It wasn’t loud, but it cut through the relentless knocking with a cold clarity that rooted me to the spot.

“Come back inside.”

It wasn’t a demand. It was a plea, soft and almost… sad.

I swallowed hard, trying to summon some kind of courage. “What do you want from me?” I shouted, my voice breaking.

The knocking stopped. The forest fell silent, heavy and oppressive. I picked up the flashlight and backed away toward the car, refusing to take my eyes off the cabin.

I didn’t notice the new note pinned to the tree next to me until the paper fluttered in the wind.

My heart sank as I read the jagged handwriting:

“They’re already inside.”

I turned toward the car, fumbling for the keys in my pocket, when I felt it—a hand on my shoulder.

Not a breeze, not a brush of leaves. A hand.

My blood ran cold, but before I could scream or turn around, the grip tightened, pulling me back toward the cabin with a force I couldn’t fight. My feet dragged across the gravel as the door seemed to grow larger, closer, until it swallowed me in its shadow.

The moment I crossed the threshold, the air changed. The knocking stopped, the wind outside ceased, and the world became… heavy.

The cabin wasn’t the same anymore.

The walls were covered in deep scratches, like claw marks, and the floor sagged under my weight as though it might collapse. The air smelled of earth and decay, and the single window was no longer boarded up—it was just gone, replaced by blackness.

A faint sound came from the back of the cabin, a low, guttural noise like something breathing. Slowly. Wetly.

And then I saw it.

A figure stood in the far corner, shrouded in shadows. It was too tall, its limbs too long, bending in ways that shouldn’t be possible. But the worst part was its face—or lack of one.

It didn’t have features, just a smooth, reflective surface where a face should be.

And that surface… it was showing me.

Not just my reflection, but my life. Moments I’d forgotten. Choices I regretted. Secrets I hadn’t even admitted to myself. They played across its face like a flickering film, and with each passing second, I felt myself unraveling.

“You shouldn’t have come,” it said, its voice echoing with layers, like a dozen people speaking at once.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t speak.

The figure took a step closer, and I realized something horrifying.

Its shadow wasn’t cast on the floor—it was stretching toward me.

And then I understood. The cabin hadn’t trapped me here. It hadn’t been keeping me in.

It had been keeping them out.

The shadow reached me before I could move.

It wasn’t cold like I expected—it was warm, almost comforting, like sinking into a heavy quilt. My legs buckled, and I collapsed onto the creaking floor.

The figure loomed over me, its smooth, reflective face tilting as though studying me. My life still played across its surface, faster now, fragments flashing by in bursts of color and sound.

Then, it leaned down, impossibly close, and whispered:

“Don’t forget… you agreed.”

Before I could ask what it meant, the cabin door slammed shut behind me, plunging everything into darkness.

When I woke up, I was standing in the forest. The cabin was gone.

But the knocking… it followed me home.

The problem is that it's going to rain almost the entire time I'm in Colombia. In Bogota and Medellin I can still do things indoors but I’m concerned about spending 3 days in Salento where there are thunderstorms and heavy rain. My plan in Salento was to hike Cocora valley, bike in Filandia [explore cafes/coffee], and do coffee/cacao tours. Now I am considering replacing Salento with flying to Cartagena because of the weather i.e. day 1 [explore the city and fly/take bus to Santa Marta], day 2 [Tayrona], day 3 [Tayrona + flight to Medellin]. What do you think?

A little about what I want: I enjoy museums, art, architecture and making workshops. I love the outdoors; hiking and water activities. But I do want to take this trip a bit slow and not exert myself too much. I decided to skip Cartagena initially because I didn’t have enough days for Tayrona, but now if I’m skipping Salento I could do it.

If you want to discuss Tool theories and help me conceptualize Tool as I personally have come to the conclusions whereabouts, it could be in your benefit to DM me or comment with me here. I hold no secrets and am willing to share my Theories on what Tool is doing. 

I have reached a high point in my on tracking abilities to attempt to conclude aspects of Tool's album Ænima. Its been 9 years since I had developed my study. Constant over aggregated and envisioning amounts of listening to somehow get down just what Maynard or whomever included (Message to Harry Mannback) is saying. I have organized the Production into acquired playlists to somewhat condense them into simpler forms. 

I believe i have grasped the Tool concept down to understand that firstly they are about progression and ""Thinking For Yourself. Questioning Authority"" and have the highest interest in how this is applied to their music. Long night hours and dozens of psuedo Reddit posts in quasi attempts to try and come to a collective reasoning. My efforts havent failed however. Much as I am glad to say of my information comes from Toolfans as a major influence to my compendium (i realize that Tool production may not be entirely finished, and hope it never be). 

From Luke Coffee to Fever Tinnitus I have studied. One particular realm I had not gotten into is Rhythm. Not attempting to do the correct mathematics and too lazy in the heart to be able to center up all the complicated measures. I am more interested in trusting that Tool got it correct because *They* can do the math. However the numbers intrigue me, as well as the spirit. 

In my solace i intend to have a discussion with another Tool fan about Conceptual Tool topic beyond sounding like im just a plain old schizophrenic and should be ignored. My ideas are rich with the saliva of an out of this world animal in 4/5 forms, vivaciously churning my internal organs from the emotion and depth that Tool has awakened in me. Being somewhat of big fan, i know i am not their Biggest fan. But even if i am 23rd biggest fan i intend to share my vast amount of attempted lore into Tool topic. 

I am not trying to showboat my ideas or be pompous about what i think i know and what i might not. Im simply looking for someone to hire as a fellow explorer of the deep frequency filled space that is Adam Jones' insane Ascension / Descent Guitar. Merely interests bring me to post this post. Bring what you may be open to hearing, and lets discuss the conceptual nature of Tool's work with me. 

I am in the conceptual nature that astounds me and i like it here. If you like Tool and want to have a discussion about involving possibilities that Tool has produced. Leave a comment or dm and lets talk about Concepts of Tool magic. As it is, as it will or wont be (depending on how you look at it)

I've been on quite a journey trying to find the perfect coffee machine for my home, and I thought I'd share my experience and insights with you all. After months of research and testing different machines, I think I've finally cracked the code on what makes a great home coffee maker.

First off, let me tell you why I started this search. I was tired of spending $5 every morning at my local coffee shop, and honestly, the quality was hit or miss. I wanted something reliable that could make great coffee right in my kitchen.

Through my research, I discovered that the best coffee machine for home use really depends on your specific needs. If you're like me and need your coffee ASAP in the morning, you might want a programmable machine that can have your coffee ready when you wake up. Some machines even have built-in grinders, which is perfect for fresh-ground coffee enthusiasts.

I found some excellent options at https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine that range from basic drip coffee makers to fancy espresso machines. There's seriously something for everyone, regardless of your budget or coffee preferences.

Here's what I learned you should consider when choosing a home coffee machine:

1. Brewing capacity - How many cups do you need?
2. Counter space - Some machines are pretty bulky
3. Ease of cleaning - Trust me, this is crucial
4. Special features - Like strength control or temperature settings
5. Durability - You want something that'll last

The great thing about modern coffee machines is that they've come a long way in terms of technology. Many now have features like pause-and-serve, keep-warm functions, and even smartphone connectivity. Pretty cool, right?

I personally went with a mid-range model that has a built-in grinder and programmable settings. It's been a game-changer for my morning routine, and I'm saving so much money compared to my old coffee shop habit.

If you're interested in checking out some options, I found this great selection at https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine. They have detailed reviews and comparisons that really helped me make my decision.

Here's a pro tip: whatever machine you choose, make sure to clean it regularly and use filtered water. This makes a huge difference in the taste of your coffee and the longevity of your machine.

The best coffee machine for your home is ultimately the one that fits your lifestyle and coffee preferences. Whether you're a casual coffee drinker or a full-blown coffee connoisseur, there's definitely a perfect machine out there for you.

Ever felt like your office chair is trying to strangle you? Or maybe your mouse is giving you the silent treatment as it rolls away yet again. Welcome to the wonderful world of office ergonomics! Let's dive in and make your workspace as comfy as your favorite Sunday morning couch.
  
  
## Understanding Ergonomics

You know, when I first heard the word ""ergonomics,"" I thought it was some fancy term for a yoga pose or maybe a new dance move. I mean, who wouldn’t want to bust a move called the “Ergo Shuffle”? But as I stumbled through my first office job, I quickly learned that ergonomics is all about making our workspaces comfy and safe. Picture this: I was sitting at my desk, hunched over like a pretzel, typing away. Suddenly, I reached for my coffee, and—whoops!—my elbow knocked over my lunch. Tomato soup everywhere! That’s when I realized, “Hey, maybe I should pay attention to how I sit and where I put my stuff.”

Ergonomics is crucial in the workplace because it helps prevent injuries and boosts productivity. When we set up our desks right, we can avoid those annoying aches and pains. Think about it: a good chair, the right monitor height, and even a keyboard that doesn’t make your fingers feel like they’re doing the cha-cha can make a world of difference. Plus, when we’re comfortable, we’re happier and more focused. So, let’s embrace ergonomics and keep our necks and backs happy—because nobody wants a desk job that’s literally a pain in the neck!

## The Perfect Setup

Setting up your workspace like a pro is like crafting the perfect sandwich—every layer matters! First off, let’s talk about chair height. You want your feet flat on the ground, knees at a right angle, and your thighs parallel to the floor. If your chair is too high, you might as well be sitting on a barstool at a comedy club—uncomfortable and awkward! 

Now, onto the monitor. I’ve had my fair share of battles with monitor glare. Picture this: I’m working diligently, coffee in hand, when suddenly, the sun decides to play peek-a-boo right through my window. My screen turns into a mirror, and I’m left squinting at my own reflection like I’m in a bad horror movie. To avoid this, position your monitor about an arm’s length away, and tilt it slightly away from the light source. Trust me, your eyes will thank you!

Don’t forget about your keyboard and mouse! They should be at the same level as your elbows, which should be at a comfy 90 degrees. If you’re reaching for them like they’re on a high shelf, you’re setting yourself up for a wrist ache. 

So, take a moment to adjust your setup. Your body will feel the difference, and you might even find yourself more productive. Who knew ergonomics could be this fun?

## The Art of Sitting

Ah, the art of sitting! You might think it’s as simple as plopping down in a chair, but oh boy, it’s a whole science. I mean, have you ever tried to find the “perfect” sitting position? It’s like trying to find a unicorn in your backyard—rare and probably a little mythical. But let’s dive into the nitty-gritty of good posture, shall we?

First off, let’s talk about that chair. It should support your lower back like a good friend supports you during a tough time—firm but gentle. Your feet should be flat on the floor, or on a footrest if you’re feeling fancy. And your knees? They should be at a right angle, like a well-behaved corner of a room. 

Now, here’s a fun tip: every 30 minutes, do a little wiggle dance in your seat. Seriously! It keeps the blood flowing and reminds your body that it’s not a statue. And don’t forget to adjust your screen. Your eyes should be level with the top of your monitor. If you’re looking down, you might as well be reading a book on the floor!

So, keep these tips in mind, and remember: good posture is like a good joke—timing is everything!

## Gadgets Galore

You know, when it comes to ergonomic office equipment, I can’t help but think of my old mouse. Oh boy, that thing was a relic! It was like trying to steer a ship with a broken rudder. I remember one day, I was in the middle of an important project—my deadline was looming like a dark cloud—and my mouse decided it was time to throw a tantrum. I’d click, and it would just sit there, staring back at me like it was on a coffee break. I swear, I could almost hear it saying, “Not today, buddy!”

Now, let’s talk about why having the right gear is crucial. Ergonomic keyboards and mice are designed to keep your hands and wrists in a natural position. This means less strain and fewer chances of developing those pesky repetitive strain injuries. Trust me, you don’t want to be the person who can’t open a jar of pickles because your wrist is screaming at you. 

Investing in good ergonomic equipment can make a world of difference. It’s like upgrading from a tricycle to a sports car. You’ll be zooming through your tasks instead of crawling along, battling with a mouse that’s more stubborn than a toddler refusing to eat broccoli. So, do yourself a favor—ditch the old gear and embrace the gadgets galore! Your body will thank you, and you might even find yourself laughing instead of grimacing at your desk.

## Eye on the Prize

You know, I never really thought about how much my eyes were working until one fateful afternoon. I was deep into a project, staring at my computer screen like it was the last slice of pizza at a party. Hours flew by, and suddenly, I felt this weird heaviness in my eyelids. It was like they were trying to stage a protest against my screen time! I rubbed my eyes, squinted, and realized I was straining to see. That’s when it hit me—proper lighting and monitor positioning are crucial for eye health.

Imagine this: you’re sitting at your desk, and the overhead lights are flickering like a disco ball. Not exactly the vibe you want while trying to focus, right? Good lighting should be soft and even, reducing glare on your screen. I learned that the hard way! 

And let’s talk about monitor positioning. Your screen should be about an arm's length away, with the top of the monitor at or just below eye level. This way, you’re not craning your neck or squinting like you’re trying to read a menu in a dimly lit restaurant. Trust me, your eyes will thank you for it! So, take a moment to adjust your workspace. Your peepers deserve a break!

## Move It or Lose It

You know, they say sitting is the new smoking. I mean, who knew that my beloved office chair was secretly plotting against my health? I once thought I could sneak in a little workout while working. Picture this: I’m at my desk, feeling all motivated, and I decide to try a “desk workout.” I had seen a video online where someone was doing squats while typing. Easy, right? Wrong! 

So there I was, squatting like a pro, or at least trying to, when I realized my chair was still behind me. I went down for a squat, and instead of rising like a majestic phoenix, I ended up crashing into my chair. Let’s just say my coworkers got a good laugh, and I got a bruise that looked like a map of the world. 

But here’s the thing: regular movement is crucial. It’s not just about avoiding embarrassing moments; it’s about keeping our bodies happy. Studies show that taking short breaks to stretch or walk can boost productivity and creativity. So, whether it’s a quick stroll to the water cooler or a few stretches at your desk, just remember: move it or lose it! And maybe, just maybe, leave the squats for the gym.

## Conclusions
  
  
So there you have it, folks! With a little tweak here and a little adjustment there, we can transform our workspaces into comfortable, productive oases. Remember, ergonomics isn't just about fancy chairs and gadgets; it's about listening to our bodies and giving them what they need.

1gzxwif,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gzxwif/its_lurking_in_the_forest_with_fire_in_its_eyes/,"it's lurking in the forest, with fire in its eyes.","Hello all, I'm new to reddit and I'm here to tell you about my strange discovery in the forest of Oregon. For a bit of Backstory my name is Curt and I'm an amature Cryptozoology, and when I say armature I mean amature. I believe in Bigfoot and Nessy and UFOs, and I know something here or there about mythology. 

Any how, I have lived in Oregon all 40 years of my life and I had always been curious about the massive forests all around where I lived, what could be hiding in those trees just out of sight? Such curiosity is how I found myself searching local folklore on anything strange or unheard of in the forests nearby. One day in the fall of 2006 I found myself in a small diner outside of Junction city, a small farming town north of where I lived. I was sitting there drinking my coffee when overheard two older gentlemen speaking to each other at the other end of the bar table. 

“ I'm telling you Bill I saw it, It was looking right at me.”
“ ah horse shit Frank, you were probably drunk knowing you.”

“I swear Bill, gods Honest truth. It was just like the stories your dad use to tell us.” 

“ my Pa was as much of a drunk as you are, probably more.”

As they continued to speak to each other I moved down the bar towards them. 
“excuse me gentlemen? I couldn't help but over hear your conversation. Tell me what did you see?” 

The skinnier of the two, Bill, rolled his eyes at me, but Frank continued. 

“ I saw the Lurker.” He said excited that some one cared to hear his story. 

“the lurker?” I asked unsure of what he meant. He leaned in close and said. 

“The Lurker is a local mystery, it lives in the woods, watching us.” He paused and took a swig of his Beer. 

“I was out stalking one of the local trails, looking for white tail. While I was trudging through the brush I hear a loud cracking sound in the trees ahead. I stopped to see what it could be, thinking it was a Cougar or a Deer. When I saw one of the trees move as if it turned away from me in that brief moment I saw two gleaming Orange eyes like two burning coals.” 

Bill let out a scoff.
“More likely you saw someones tail lights.”

“ I know the difference between tail lights and eyes Bill!” Frank exclaimed as he shot his head In Bill's direction. 

“How do you know that it's the Lurker?” I interjected. 

“ folks been seeing it for years and it's always described the same way.” Frank continued.

“What did you do next?” 

“Nothing, I blinked and just like that it was gone again as if it had never been there. Then I made my way back to my Pick-up and headed back home.” 

I sipped from my coffee as contemplating Frank's tale, the exhilaration of finding something unknown crept up my spine. 

“Where was this?” I asked, trying to downplay my excitement. 

Frank looked at me with a twinge of suspicion in his eyes. 

“Why do you want to know?”

“morbid curiosity, I'm doing research for a blog on folklore.” 

Frank scratched the back of his head uncomfortably. 

“Alright, it was on a game trail out by Fern ridge. It's not far from a hiking trail that's visited often.”

I thanked him, payed for my coffee then left. 
I was actually familiar with the hiking trail Frank had told me about, so I headed straight there. I arrived at Fern Ridge later that afternoon and made my way down the hiking trail towards the woods. Soon enough I found the game trail that Frank had told me about. As I made my way through the underbrush, I felt the tingle of my hairs standing up in excitement. The foliage got thicker and thicker as I continued, suddenly, I lost my footing and fell into the bushes. When I looked down towards my feet I saw a huge hole that I had slipped into. 

I got up, brushed myself off and inspected  the hole. It was about 3 feet wide and about 1 foot deep, I was lucky I hadn't really hurt myself. Then I noticed that there was a bunch of loose soil both in and around the hole. it looked like the hole left by a tree being uprooted, only there was no fallen tree nearby. I felt a shiver up my spine, I couldn't tell you why. I shook my head thinking an animal had just been digging in the dirt. But as I looked up the trail I saw another hole about 15 feet away, and another, and another. If I didn't know any better I would've said they were footprints. I felt a lump forming in my throat and the sudden urge to follow the trail growing in the back of my head.

Against my better judgment I began to follow the foot trail of “foot prints.” The excitement of finding something truly undiscovered too enticing to ignore. As I continued a little voice in my head began to implore me not to follow, but that voice was little more than a whisper.
Soon, I found the trail lead to a small clearing, the prints stopped exactly where I was standing. I look around and saw no trace of the prints I looked about and saw that the Sun was starting to set, I must have really lost track of time. 

I turned around making one last pass at the clearing, when a cacophony of screeches shot up from the trees just to my left. I nearly jumped out of my skin as a murder of crows came bursting from the trees circling another the clearing. They flew into the air like a black cloud, slowly spiraling towards the ground. Feeling a sudden pull drawing me towards where they were landing. As I made my way closer, my skin began to crawl as I felt the putrid stench of rot in the air. My heart stopped as I looked down, there laying in the middle of the clearing was a body, torn to pieces, entrails strewn around like streamers. 

I turned away, retching up what little I had in my stomach. I pulled myself back up, my eye locked with the dead puffy eye in the shattered remnants of its skull. One of the larger crows landed there cocking its head at me curiously. It squawked and pecked at the wet puffy eye, pulling it free with a wer sucking sound. It quickly gobbled up the eye, I was to shocked and filled with disbelief to move. The crow tilted its head at me again, and for a brief moment I could have sworn I saw a glint of orange in the birds eye. 
It screeched and flew away, as it did all of my senses slowly returned to me I felt my arms start to move frantically to my phone. I scrambled to dial, 9-1-1, A woman's voice immediately answered.

“ 911 help line please state the nature of your emergency.”
“hi….I….oh god…I'd like to report a dead body!”

“OK sir please tell me your name.”

I felt my tongue glued to the roof of my mouth as I tried to answer.

“ my name is C-Curt, Curt Walsh! I'm out off a game trail just off Fern ridge…I was going for a walk and I found….oh God I can't even tell…ma’am it's bad…please..send someone.”

She tried to calm me down, but all I could do was hear the Crows, they began to squawk in a more full chorus.

“ Curt I need you to tell me if the officers and paramedics can get to you.”

The birds squawking grew louder, I clutched my head as my ears began to ring.

“I…..I…what!?” I shouted into the phone, she responded louder.

“can the Paramedics and Officers get to you?” 

“I….I'm not sure I'm off the usual trail about a quarter of a mile!”

The birds kept calling out trying to drown out all other sounds. My ears began to ring louder the woman's voice was a muffled mess I felt an ear piercing yell tear out of my lungs.

“SHUT UP!!!!” 

suddenly the birds all stopped and cranked their heads towards me. There was an uncomfortable silence made all the worse now that the noise was gone. The crows spread their wings and took to the sky flying towards the slowly sinking sun. As I watched I heard the woman.
“ Curt?! Curt? Are you ok?”

I placed the phone back to my ear.
“ y-yes…..sorry there was a group of crows…they…led me to the body…and they were being loud…I'm sorry.” 

She hesitated then in a soft voice replied.
“It's Ok….the officers are on their way, can you help them find the body?”

“uh, yes… I can go off the trail and lead the officers here.”

She spoke softly over the phone.
“OK would you like me to stay on the call with you until then?”

I stuttered my mind still a whir with the sound of the crows and the discovery at my feet. 
“Yes…please…miss?”
“Lizz.” She responded softly.
 “My name is Lizz.”

As I walked back to the main trail I spoke to Lizz, explaining why I was out there, and how the Crows had led me to the body. She spoke softly to me trying to keep me calm. She seemed sweet and kind over the phone, I would have asked her for more pleasant company bit given the circumstances I decided now was not the time. As I reached the trail a half hour later I saw the lights flickering from the officers and paramedics.

“Alright I'm back at the main trail, thank you Lizz, for the calming conversation.”

She spoke softly and said 
“It's alright Curt, I hope you are OK and the Paramedics can help you.”

I felt a pang in my stomach as I knew the conversation was ending. I blurted out.
“Could I get your Number!”

She chuckled over the other end.
“Well this is the strangest way a guy has ever asked for that but sure, why not?”

I pulled out my pocket book and wrote down the number she game me. We exchanged pleasantries and the call ended.
Soon I brought the Officers and the Paramedics around to the clearing, the began to investigate the body as I told them the whole story. How I had been out there following some tracks, how the crows startled me and I followed them to the body. One of the officers looked at me strangely, he was an older man maybe in his late Fifties. his name badge gleamed in the flash light
‘Lesky’

“You a journo?”

I shook my head slowly.
“No, why do you ask?”

“cuz it sounds like you were looking for the Lurker.”

I felt my stomach twist slightly.
“I was…is there a problem.”

Lusky slowly adjusted his cap.
“listen kid, people who go looking for old ghost stories usually find nothing but trouble. So do me and my guys here a favor and quit while you're ahead.” 

A new twinge of morbid curiosity tingled up my spine.

“What makes you say that?”

He pulled a cigarette from his coat pocket.
“the last time some city slicker came here to look for the Lurker, he wound up dead.”
His eyes trailed to the macabre strewn corpse.
“and it was about as pretty as this.”

I raised my eyebrows
“what are you saying a local legend did this.”

“all i'm saying, is that there's something in these woods…and it wants to be left alone.”
A thin trail of smoke left his mouth, as he flicked his barely started Cigarette onto the ground stomping it into the brackish mud.
 He turned away from me and started telling his men to finish up as the Paramedics where almost finished packing up the body.

“ am I done here?” I asked one of the other officers, He nodded to me.
“if you are feeling well enough to drive you can head home now, we may call you in for another statement once the coronary report comes in.”

I nodded, thanked him and turned around to leave. as I slowly made my way to back towards the edge of the clearing I caught something just off the other end. Two gleaming lights, like burning coals. I blinked my eyes and shook my head, they were gon just as soon as they appeared. I shuddered thinking my mind was playing tricks on me as I made my way back to my car I couldn't help but Shake the feeling I was being watched.

1gzxvvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gzxvvg/aitah_for_being_frustrated_with_wifes_friends/,AITAH for being frustrated with wife's friends visit?,"My wife chastised me for saying ""Thank God"" when her friends left today. Wanted some outside perspective on this pretty trivial experience. 

TL/DR: wife got mad at me because I'm irritated about her visiting friends eating all our food, having loud/whiney kids, staying an extra day and not reciprocating meals.

My wife dropped $80 on pizza Friday when they got here. I have no problem with this other than the excessive amount of pizza that was left over, but with kids around I figured it wouldn't go to waste. Pizza wasn't good enough for their kids, who demanded chicken fingers. My wife pulled some out of the freezer for them. By the time they were cooked the kids had forgotten them and they ended up in the trash.

Saturday they took the kids to the zoo and I stayed back to do some work. When they finished my wife dropped our kid off for nap and I stayed home with him while they went out for lunch. They said they would bring something back for me. 3 hours later they show up with a cold cheese burger, no sides or anything. I ask what the plan is for dinner and they say we will either go out or order take out. 

A few hours later I walk in the kitchen and everyone is around the table eating leftover pizza. There was only 1 slice left for me. End up scrounging through the cupboard and find some soup. 

Sunday we get up and take the kids to the park. We go home and put my kiddo down for his nap. We have lunch with what we have on hand and that's when I realize they aren't planning to leave. I quietly ask my wife and she confirms they are leaving first thing Monday. I double check our shared calander and there's no info about their visit, which is highly unusual for my wife not to add. She did write it on our wall calander but shows them leaving Sunday. Visits through Sunday are not something I would normally agree to, especially with loud, obnoxious kids. At one point their youngest was non-stop screaming for his mom while she was on the can. She was yelling back at him that he needed to ask his dad for help. This went on until she finished up and all he asked for was some water, which he had refused from every other adult.

Anyway, they decide to go to a brewery for dinner but I decided to stay back and watch football. Just needed a break at this point.  My wife brought some food back for me and everyone went to bed super early.

Monday morning comes. They walk my kid to school and I set up to get some work done. Unfortunately my work space is open and I can't shut a door if I need quiet. They sit around drinking coffee and feeding their kids until almost 11 before they finally leave. 

The door shuts and I say ""Thank God"" as the car pulls away. She looks at me like I'm the biggest jerk and think my reasoning for being irritated is completely irrational. 

Out of curiosity I check our cc statement and everywhere they went there were charges. I asked if my wife if they offered to pick up the tab anywhere and she said they bought her a beer at lunch on Saturday. She said I was being petty for even asking. 

This isn't about the money, but the thought behind it. If someone feeds my family, I will be getting the next meal. It's more that lack of appreciation or thanks. 

If you've made it this far, you're a trooper. This was more of a way for me to vent than anything else. Thanks!

I'm 29 years old, living in Belfast and just finishing my uni studies in the humanities. I work full-time now but find that on my off days I'm mostly just bored unless I end up learning something new. 

So am taking on mathematics, something that I've always really struggled with. Have got a year 1 undergrad textbook which I'm slowly working through, and I figured it would be neat to have a study buddy I could meet with once a week (was thinking at 2 Royal Avenue, one of those wee booths). 

This could work a couple different ways. We could work through the same textbook(s) together if you want to learn the same thing, and help each other get through. Or if you're good at STEM and want to learn some of the humanities fields I'm skilled in I'd be happy to do like a tuition-exchange type deal. Or we could just basically body double and get coffee afterwards! :)

Have done similar arrangements in the past and found it's a really effective way to stick out a course and make some friends along the way so, if you're interested feel free to DM. Am ideally looking for someone 30+ as I relate to people of this age cohoort better. If multiple people are interested and want to form like a Belfast adult study group am also down with that so long as it's small enough in size to be manageable.",5,1732578684.0,northernireland,0,1.0,False

1gzxr18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsburyPark/comments/1gzxr18/asbury_dark/,Asbury Dark,"Oh, Asbury Park, where do I even start? This town is a bizarre mix of charm and chaos, and sometimes it feels like it’s trying way too hard to be Brooklyn by the beach. Sure, the boardwalk is cool, and the history of the Stone Pony is undeniable, but can we talk about how pretentious the vibe has gotten? Every other block is a new overpriced coffee shop or some boutique selling “vintage” items that are clearly marked up beyond reason.

And the parking! Don’t even get me started on the nightmare that is trying to find a spot during the summer. You’d think the city planners would have sorted that out by now, but nope. Instead, you end up paying some insane fee to park half a mile away from where you actually want to be.

Then there’s the food scene. Yes, there are some gems, but it’s like every new restaurant is competing to have the most Instagrammable plates rather than focusing on, you know, actual taste. And can we address the absurdity of $15 cocktails? I get that Asbury is “trendy,” but that doesn’t mean we need to fund your artisanal ice cubes.

Don’t get me wrong—Asbury Park has its moments. The beach is beautiful, and there’s a solid sense of community in pockets. But sometimes it feels like the soul of the town is being drowned out by gentrification and a desperate attempt to be “the next big thing.” It’s like Asbury is trying so hard to be cool, it forgot what made it special in the first place.

Im literally addicted to caffeine and I love it. I look forward to that morning caffeine hit every morning. I'm at the point where my body is so screwed up and overly stressed out. I've tried everything to fix it but I think I need to quit caffeine.

I quit drinking alcohol and I thought that would fix it but it hasn't. MY major symptoms are stressed out body, major gut problems.  Always bloated, constipation. I've tried cutting down but my body feels like it needs it. My average is probably 500 to 700 mg 

I tapered down to about 250 a day. Which I was doing okay but still don't feel like my body was healing. I recently started a new job working 12 hours a day and I just relapsed and had 750 yesterday and felt terrible. I felt like I needed caffeine to survive and get through the shift. 

I love caffeine so much and I feel like I'm gonna be depressed without it. But I can't go on feeling miserable in my body. 

I don't know how I'm gonna survive 12 hour shifts.

I used to pound 1 to 2 energy drinks a day, preworkout and coffee. And i think it finally screwed up my body.  I quit preworkout which was so hard. My normal is probably 300 on my days off of work and 600 on work days now.

How do I navigate this without destroying lives?","Hello Reddit. This has been weighing on my conscious for over a year now, and I'm honestly not sure how to handle it. It's long, so settle in, grab a tea/coffee/whiskey and enjoy my mental anguish.

I (38f) met my friend Dave (42m) about 4 years ago in an online gaming forum. During the entire time we talked, I became friends with his wife Brenda (43f), and he became friends with my fiancé Mikel (38m). I live by the rule in a relationship that if there is conversation that I wouldn't feel comfortable showing my significant other, then I don't need to be having that conversation. At no point did Dave ever cross a line with me, nor was there ever inappropriate conversation. This is important.

About a year and a half ago (summertime) Mikel got a big promotion and we hosted a fun weekend long celebration at our home. We invited Dave and Brenda, who live 5 hours from us, and this was the first time we actually met them in person. I instantly connected with Brenda, as she was so authentic and sweet. We all got along well, and even started talking about doing future get-togethers and vacations. It seemed perfect. At this time my company was doing major layoffs and I was looking for a new career. Brenda has worked at a remote company for over a decade and recommended I apply. After a few intense interviews, I was hired.

Quick side note: Dave had been injured in work related accident that had gone to court, he sued and won. He was permanently disabled because of the accident and can no longer work at his profession. That, along with a large life insurance policy from his parents, he is financially set for life. He stays home and raises their daughter Lia (5), while Brenda does her remote work from the house as well.

So, a little over a year ago (during the fall, a few months after the celebration weekend) Dave and Brenda were getting ready to take their daughter Lia (5) on a vacation. Before they left for the airport, Dave said he needed to talk to me, it was urgent, so I stepped away to take the call. Dave then told me he had literally nobody else to talk to this about, and was deeply depressed, and needed to confide in me as a friend. *I.. really wish he hadn't.*

He told me that the night before he had gotten into a huge fight with who he calls his best friend, Rachel (41f). I had heard about Rachel but never met her, and didn't know too much about her, to be honest. What I did know: Dave, Brenda and Rachel had been friends in college (approximately 20 year long friendship), she had visited at Dave and Brenda's house several times over the years, and that Rachel allegedly had been in a string of bad relationships of which Dave had had to bail her out financially a few times. That's about it.

Here comes the information that I wish Dave hadn't told me, as it has completely changed how I view my friend: Dave told me that Rachel confessed to him the night before that she knew he was attracted to her. Yes, she is gorgeous. Dave said he has always been attracted to her physically, but mentally her personality (specifically her shallowness) was a huge turnoff for him. Some unkind things were said about Brenda ""letting herself go"" since having Lia, which disgusted me. He then said Rachel confessed that she is frustrated with her never-ending chain of bad relationships and wants to finally settle down. She knows he is wealthy and can give her the life she feels she deserves. She wants him to leave Brenda and Lia, move to Rachel's city, buy her a large house, and let her be his trophy wife. (I choked back a laugh at this because I literally thought it was a joke. Seriously?) She admits to NOT being physically attracted to him (Okay, who says things like that?!), but knows she can satisfy him and he can give her the lifestyle she deserves. She just demands that he has to completely cut off the life he has now, including all friends and family, and be with her. What is worse, Rachel has been planning this for literally YEARS. Sitting in their home, eating their food, drinking their wine, holding Lia, laughing with Brenda, all while planning this.

I was floored. I asked what Brenda thought of all this. He said he didn't tell her. I asked him how Rachel took it when he told her to F- off. He said he didn't. He doesn't want to lose her as a friend and he even considered her proposition. *I felt sick.*

I told him I was shocked, and to me, even if he decides not to take Rachel up on it, this is a betrayal to Brenda. Dave explained that while his and my conversations consisted of gaming, stupid memes, and planning potential couples vacations, his conversations with Rachel were emotional and raw. They spoke for hours on end, every single day, while he was caring for Lia, and while Brenda was working in the next room. Ok, ewwwww. Stop.

He asked my opinion, and I told him he has 2 options: either leave Brenda, or completely break off all contact with Rachel and focus on his marriage.. but since he asked, in my opinion Brenda needed to know. Especially since she considered Rachel a friend, and knowing that Rachel wants to screw over Brenda and Lia. Seriously typing this disgusts me.

After the call ended I told Mikel about it. He was as shocked as I was, but asked what I was going to do. I just sat there trying to digest what I had just heard.

Dave, Brenda and Lia went on their vacation. During this time we didn't communicate. When he got back he told me that he had cut Rachel off, but refused to tell Brenda about it. Ok, fine whatever. I don't agree with his action to not tell her, but It's not my life, not my relationship. He asked for advice and I gave it. I told him that in my eyes, he had betrayed his wife, whether physically or not, and I still felt that Brenda deserved to know.

Almost immediately I felt myself pulling away from Dave. My image of him was damaged. When I interact with Brenda online for work, I'm professional and friendly, but it's painful keeping this secret. However, as time passed I began to think that perhaps this was over. Dave had just made a stupid mistake and was just thinking about what could be. He didn't actually leave her, right? And most importantly, he cut Rachel out.

Dave and I begin talking a bit more. I actually thought maybe things can go back to the way they were. Since didn't actually physically cheat, maybe it's best that Brenda doesn't know, for her own mental health and happiness. Maybe we can move past this. So many thoughts going through my mind. SO many ways of rationalizing this. The mental gymnastics were Olympics level impressive.

Then about a month ago he drops the bomb. He tells me that Rachel and he are talking again. She allegedly begged him for forgiveness, and cried that she is going through another horrible breakup and needs his friendship, or else she ""doesn't know what she might do"". He said he is going to keep her at arms length, but SHE NEEEEEDS HIM. He will just be there for her a little bit, but it won't be like it was before. Oh holy knight...

To my chagrin (love that word), as the weeks pass he begins to mention her more and more. I tell him I don't want to hear about her, and when he keeps going I finally snap and tell him not to mention her to me at all. I'm so pissed that he is talking to her again, and that he doesn't care about how me knowing this is putting more guilt and strain in my mind especially when I have to interact with HIS WIFE. It's completely unfair that he told me about his ""situationship"" with Rachel, knowing that I consider Brenda a friend, and that we work together EVERY DAY. I've begged him to tell Brenda about it. She has the right to decide if she wants to stay. And most of all that he is actively still friends with a woman who wishes hurt and pain on his wife and little girl. How do you sleep at night sir...

Dave still talks about planning vacations together with Mikel and I, but I don't even respond. Honestly I don't see how I can sit at dinner with them and keep quiet, especially if Rachel were to get brought up in conversation, and especially if wine is involved. and let's be honest, there WILL BE WINE. I have one of those faces that speaks my mind without saying a word, which is why I do better working remote, vs client facing.

I dread the day when/if either Dave or Brenda say that Rachel is coming to visit them again. I can pretend it won't happen, but let's be honest. Dave is a complete moron who managed to somehow miraculously prevent his marriage from going up in flames, only to soak himself in gasoline and open the door to the walking, talking, ""gorgeous yet shallow"" lit match.

Reddit: help me. I want to cut him out completely because I am so disgusted by his actions, but I know Brenda will be upset and drill me about it. Especially since they have been planning a trip to Europe for next year and wanting us to come. Should I just tell her that we had a falling out? Should I find a way to hint to Brenda not to trust Rachel? I didn't even want to know ANY of this, and I'm so pissed that he dumped this on me. We were friends, but not *that* type of friend.

As for Brenda, I would want to know if I were friends with and playing host to a girl who wanted to steal my husband, and the father of my child. But I'm also concerned about my job, my livelihood. She's been with the company over 10 years and I've only been a year. I've kept this secret from her for so long. If I say something, can it affect my employment? Should I just pull away from them and when asked make some lame excuse like I am too busy?

TLDR: Friend confides in me that he is considering leaving his marriage for mutual friend of theirs. Decides not to and cuts friend out. However, recently started up friendship with this girl again. His wife is a friend and coworker of mine.",1,1732578067.0,u_Ethical_conundrum85,0,1.0,False

And yes, I know the libraries have writers groups, but those are only about once a month, and it's just an in-and-out thing. I want something more close-knit and active, not just an hour-long meeting on my monthly calendar.

1gzxkjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1gzxkjz/there_is_hope/,There is hope! ,"Hi everyone :) I want to share a bit about my healing journey to provide hope in what seems like a hopeless situation. I came down with severe symptoms in February 2023. A few months earlier, I had suffered through some very stressful situations - a house fire, my pet died, and my partner was hospitalized. I think the spike in my stress levels played a role in my condition, either directly (perhaps by causing an imbalance of stomach acid?) or indirectly (I was drinking more often and not as careful with what I ate). In any event, once my symptoms started, it was really hard to get them to stop.

I had always been a pretty healthy eater and minimal drinker, but this condition forced me to be very, very careful with what I ate. I couldn't see a specialist for a few months so I read everything I could and tried many different things - DGL, L-Carnosine, various herbs and teas, etc. But I think the two main things that helped me were (1) strict diet and (2) PPIs.

I went from enjoying very flavorful and spicy foods to eating very very bland and basic foods. Lots of white rice, bread, bananas, occasionally yogurt, chicken breast - all without seasoning. Absolutely NO alcohol. I still drank one cup of coffee in the morning but it was very watered down. I stopped drinking all carbonated beverages and soda. I ate a lot of crackers of all types. This was very hard but I think being strict with a bland diet is really important in the healing process.

Once I saw a specialist, I was prescribed a high dose of PPIs (omeprazole) - 40 mgs in the morning and 40 mgs in the evening. I started to see results after about 30 days, but I continued the meds as prescribed until I got an endoscopy. The endo showed moderate gastritis but the doctor said it would probably have been classified as ""severe"" had it been done before I started the PPIs.

During this time, I continued to experience pain and discomfort but the most severe symptoms started to fade. After about six months, I felt well enough to stop the PPIs. Unfortunately, you must be careful and slowly reduce the dose so that the problem doesn't return. It took me another 6 months to fully wean off of the PPIs.

Now, I am still careful about my diet. My palette has changed and I can't tolerate very spicy food anymore. My alcohol tolerance has also changed and I'm usually satisfied with one small drink. I will rarely take something like Famotidine if I feel a little flare up.

I hope this brings someone a little comfort... this condition is curable with time and patience and a lot of hard work.

Later this week I fly out to Kona & will be staying a couple weeks out there over in the Captain Cook area by myself.


Last year I visited Hawaii by doing a cruise and while experiencing Hawaii was amazing I barely got enough time to see each port because of the cruise schedule & from packing my itinerary full of things to do. 

This time around I’m doing less so I can enjoy more, I really just intend on spending most of my time bumming it at the beach & checking out food spots. I will have a rental car. I’ll be a few min drive from Manini beach so I’m assuming I’ll spend most of my time there. 

I plan on going down to the southern most point of the US, I’ll probably do some driving to see more of the island but don’t have any other points of interest yet. I’ll also probably do the Manta Ray tour because that seems so highly recommended! I went to Volcano National park last time I visited, I have the national park pass so I can get in for free, I might end up going back there to see more of it if I feel like it, little unsure there.

I also want to do some snorkeling but I’m inexperienced, I’ve only went twice but those were with tour companies. Have never just went out on my own. Any advice here would be great! 

I’d love any recommendations from food spots, coffee places, beaches, tours to see the manta rays, any cool shops/stands for locally made items, & anything else you’d recommend. 

Thank you so much! ",0,1732577676.0,VisitingHawaii,2,0.5,False

💡 **Keypoint**

* **Dyspepsia from Adderall**: Adderall, a stimulant for ADHD, can cause dyspepsia (indigestion) due to increased stomach acid production and muscle tension in the digestive tract.
* **Symptoms**: Symptoms include upper abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, heartburn, and a feeling of fullness after small meals, which can interfere with comfort and daily activities.
* **Management Strategies**: Tips include eating smaller, frequent meals, avoiding spicy or acidic foods, staying hydrated, and consulting a healthcare provider if symptoms persist. 

**Adderall** is a stimulant medication widely prescribed for managing ADHD and narcolepsy. While it can significantly improve focus and concentration, some individuals may experience **dyspepsia**—a type of indigestion that can cause discomfort in the upper abdomen. Dyspepsia may lead to symptoms like bloating, nausea, and a burning sensation, which can impact daily activities and overall comfort.

# Why Does Adderall Cause Dyspepsia?

Adderall stimulates the central nervous system and can affect digestion by increasing stomach acid production and slowing down certain digestive processes. Additionally, stimulants can sometimes cause the stomach muscles to tighten, leading to bloating, gas, and discomfort. Those with sensitive stomachs or pre-existing digestive conditions may be more prone to experiencing dyspepsia while taking Adderall.

# Common Symptoms of Dyspepsia on Adderall

If you’re experiencing dyspepsia while taking Adderall, you may notice:

* **Upper abdominal pain or discomfort**
* **Bloating or a feeling of fullness** even after small meals
* **Nausea** or mild queasiness
* **Heartburn** or a burning sensation in the chest
* **Belching** or gas

These symptoms can vary in intensity and may occur shortly after taking the medication or during meals.

# Tips to Manage Dyspepsia on Adderall

If you’re dealing with dyspepsia, consider these strategies to help alleviate symptoms:

https://preview.redd.it/ie5p74sdu43e1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=b53adc670955f49f91aa19107820712b7e008ecd

1. **Consult Your Healthcare Provider:** Speak to your doctor about the dyspepsia symptoms. They may adjust your dosage, suggest taking Adderall with food, or explore alternative treatment options if the symptoms persist.

https://preview.redd.it/4oulqwueu43e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=33f4e0d9c103a9d9a2b54ffd71367d04e417c34c

1. **Take Adderall with Food:** Eating a light snack or small meal with Adderall can help reduce stomach irritation and minimize dyspepsia. Opt for non-acidic, gentle foods that are easy to digest.

https://preview.redd.it/l3v6fuofu43e1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f8a67a3a1d1ca17ec4e10fface390e8d6fbd27c

1. **Limit Acidic or Spicy Foods:** Foods that are high in acidity or spice can worsen indigestion symptoms. Avoid foods like citrus, tomatoes, caffeine, and spicy dishes, as they may aggravate dyspepsia.

https://preview.redd.it/8s3uhyggu43e1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f842a05a7878152dbaea66b926c23a23db5bd0cc

1. **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking enough water throughout the day can aid digestion and reduce bloating. Sipping water slowly rather than gulping can also prevent additional stomach discomfort.

https://preview.redd.it/od2a2aahu43e1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cc349fa8d4dd332560327fa804dd2c3d1a09354

1. **Consider Over-the-Counter Remedies:** Antacids or acid reducers, such as omeprazole or famotidine, may help alleviate symptoms of indigestion. Consult your healthcare provider before adding any new medications to your routine.

https://preview.redd.it/qxha0szhu43e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd698e2624a6cdfc77b3333f33620841a6a5fa7c

# When to Seek Medical Help

If dyspepsia persists, worsens, or significantly interferes with your daily activities, reach out to a healthcare professional. They may recommend further evaluation or additional interventions to help manage the symptoms.

https://preview.redd.it/gdwswx4ju43e1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=008441a9a69fc76a3d43c084e17ac88ead8c9cd8

While Adderall can be beneficial for managing ADHD, side effects like dyspepsia can pose challenges. By consulting your healthcare provider and using supportive strategies, most individuals can manage indigestion effectively and continue benefiting from their treatment.

If you’re experiencing dyspepsia while taking Adderall, remember that solutions are available. Discussing symptoms with a professional can help you find relief and maintain a balanced, comfortable treatment experience.",1,1732577531.0,HowYouPill,0,1.0,False
1gzxewo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonhousing/comments/1gzxewo/sublet_private_room_at_a_lovely_flat_in_savin/,Sublet private room at a lovely flat in Savin Hill $850pcm,"Hi everyone, I'm looking to have someone take over my room in a lovely flat in Savin Hill from as early as 1 Dec 2024 move in. I have absolutely loved living in this flat and area, and the property managers are the best I've had not just in Boston, but overall renting from so many places in many different major cities. The price is an amazing bargain and the flatmates are clean and respectful. I've included a more detailed description of the place and living here below - please read it over and message me with some information about yourself and we can see if it's a good fit!

NO BROKER’S FEE CHARGED. One bedroom is available for sublet $850/month at Savin Hill. Dec 2024 move in (flexible) to Aug 31 2024 with option to renew. Lease will need to be signed, with a background check/application with the property management (\~$40, but need to check with them). Also need to pay last months and first months rent ($1700) upon move in. Fresh paint and new heating and air conditioning unit that works well. NO PETS allowed per lease. The room can be furnished with a desk, chair, and carpet for additional $. The room is approximately 9 ft by 12 ft with a closet with a window. The rest of the apartment is furnished. It is the second floor of three floors and the other tenants are quiet and respectful. There is NO brokers fee for this room.

* 8 min walk from JFK and 5 min walk from Savin Hill T-Stop (MBTA) Red Line.
* Walking distance to grocery stores, coffee shops, Asian supermarket, restaurants, beach, park, and South Bay shopping centre
* Hardwood floors and stainless appliances in the Kitchen.
* New heating and air conditioning units in each room and living room
* Washer and dryer in the building
* Off street Parking available (first-come first serve)

You will be sharing the apartment with two others who are both male, in their 30s, a PhD candidate and a working professional in the biotech field. We are looking for a roommate who is either a graduate/phd student or working professional. If you are an undergrad/under 25 years old it probably wont be a good fit. There is no drinking or smoking (420 or otherwise) and expect the same from a new roommate. We are very respectful of each other and keep the place clean and tidy. Please reach out if you are interested in setting up time to chat, and then viewing it!

Other details about the building:

Coin operated laundry (1.50/load) and dryer (1/load) is in the basement. Dishwasher included.

Per person it’s approximately (subject to change and fluctuations) $30/month for internet, $40/month for electricity, $30/month for gas, but these can fluctuate significantly with the seasons and working from home; for example in the winter months electricity and gas are higher; in the summer, gas can be lower than $10/month per person, while electricity is around the same depending on use of air conditioning. Contribution to shared goods required - toilet paper, paper towels, etc. Other amenities include a spacious kitchen, front balcony porch, and big back balcony porch. You will be asked to take on a bill under your name as we each have one.

Details about the neighbourhood:

Most of the buildings in the area have been converted to condos so the immediate area is populated by a mix of owner occupants, pet owners, young professional and couples. It is quiet and a friendly neighbourhood. The apartment is also around the corner to Boston's best Vietnamese restaurants. There is an Asian supermarket within very close walking distance, as well as the famous Ba Le Vietnamese takeout under a 10 minute walk. If you fancy a longer walk, South Bay shopping centre and Carson Beach are around a 25 minute walk. There is also Savin Hill Park less than 10 minute walk away. 

It’s an amazing place, lovely building, and great property managers as well. We are looking for the right fit for the place!

1gzxdx0,https://i.redd.it/i9hd124au43e1.jpeg,Interpreting Dexcom G7 data?,"Hi all. Two weeks ago my (65m) A1C test came back at 11.5. I saw my doctor a couple of days later and he set me up with Metformin, insulin, and Dexcom G7 sensors.

So for the past 10 days I’ve been taking my meds religiously and have made a lot of changes to my diet. I’ve been paying attention to the G7, and have been using their “Clarity” app to try to get a more detailed view of how things are going. The app reports have a lot of information - I am not certain what parts of it are significant. I plan to talk with my doctor about it when I can, but in the meantime, I’d be curious about any comments from those of you who are more experienced.

FWIW, my average blood glucose is now 130mg/dL w std dev 19mg/dL, and in the last week I’ve been 99% “in range” between 70 and 180. The attached picture shows my data for the last week - I wake up with circa 110, then my morning coffee/ light breakfast causes a rise, it goes back down, then dinner will make it rise again, then it falls. Again, any comments would be appreciated. Like: my blood glucose seems to ‘cycle’ over the course of 24 hours; does that look normal or problematic? Also: the 70-180 range is the default when I set up the G7; should I change that to (for instance) 70-160?

1gzxc80,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1gzxc80/airing_out_some_of_my_exroomates_dirty_laundry/,Airing out SOME of my ex-roomates dirty laundry. ,"I would just like to point out, this will probably not be very exciting to read, i typically don't have drama happen to me so to me this is juicier than ham. Also, I'm on mobile so sorry for errors. 

I've never really made a post like this probably won't be good. I am also very tired. 

So Barbara 19F, lived with me, 21F my boyfriend, Tom 20M and Barbara's ex-best friend Bell 19F. 

There's is like 2 years of lore with this chick, but i am lazy and do not feel like making this any longer than it already is. The important things are that 1) she has a history with flirting with my Tom. 2) she had gotten kicked out before when she was caught talking sh!t about Toms little sister, Barbara. 3) she makes all of her problems/truama her personality and everyone elses problem. 

There will also be some vagueness when it comes to Barbara and Bells relationship, because that's not my business to tell to Reddit. 

So Barbara's boyfriend had broken up with her and had no where else to go, so Bell let her move in with us. Now, something about Barbara is that every single time there is a problem, it's always the other person at fault. And she rarely has anything else to talk about that isn't talking down on other people. She always needs to find a reason to be better. This is important. 

From the moment she had moved back in, (she had been kicked out previously) she would constantly come to me telling me little things that annoyed her about Bell, or things she did that hurt her etc. For the record, I could care less about what was going on between those two, not in a mean way, just in the sense that their lives do not involve me, so I'm not going to insert myself in their problems. Having said that, I will still listen. I used to have some deep insecurities and I know how it feels when someone just listens sometimes. I also believe that talking about something can help self reflection. Sometimes when you say something out loud you starting thinking from different perspectives. Barbara never did that. Eventually Bell got kicked out due to a few reasons, the main one being Barbara talking to our landlord about what a horrible person Bell was. Also want to point out at this time Bell was paying Barbaras portion of rent and utilities. After she had moved out Barbara took every opportunity she got to make some joke about Bell being evicted, or take any opportunity to insult her. Now, I feel like most people with siblings can understand that your siblings can be a sh!t sometimes. Tom and Bell have always been very very close, so you can imagine that Tom did not like Barbara talking sh!t about his sister every chance she got. Even going so far as to go into Bells bedroom and take most of the things she wasn't able to immediately get out of the house, including a scrapbook Bells boyfriend had gotten her as an anniversary gift. Which i just find weird. The whole time Bell was in the middle of owing her things out of the house I can't even count the amount of times Barbara had said how badly she wanted to 'pop the lock on Bells door and dig through her things'. Claiming alot of them were hers, they were not. Every time I had to try and talk her out of it, basically just saying she doesn't need to risk losing her only place to live. So the last 3-4 months consisted of Tom and i waiting for her to screw up again because we knew that she would. 

And boy did she... 

I'm not really sure how to make this transition, but in the midst of all of this happening I had helped Barbara get on her feet a little bit. We're lucky enough that our landlord is family and let us stay in her house for super cheap. Barbara didn't have a job at the time and had never had one. So, I went out of my way to help her through the process of getting a new social security card, bought her first state ID so she could get a job, among buying random little things for her like clothes, boots etc. I dont make alot of money but I like to help people, even if I don't particularly like you, I try to not let my personal feelings decide what I do. I had also gotten her a job working with me. First and last time I ever reference someone. The organization I work for focuses on setting young adults on career paths, people who are struggling or have not had many opportunities in life are encouraged to join, as the point of the program is to give these people a chance they've never gotten before and a chance to grow. These opportunities includes multiple training courses that are not cheap to obtain. They also have programs that help teenagers get their  high school diplomas, they do volunteer work, they have people who organize classroom projects for elementary schools etc. They have alot of programs but i won't go deep into that .The organization pays for everything, including your uniforms and travel, all you have to do is show up and want to be there. I have been there for a year, i am a crew leader so she got hired onto my crew. There were 6 people total, myself and five crew members. She immediately had issues with 3 of her fellow coworkers. I will say, two of them were quite irritating, but she knew that we hire people of all different backgrounds, i had explained to her in detail before she started that there will be people you don't like, every single day I would have her talking my head off in the mornings on the way to work, making us late multiple times because she just wouldn't shut up, listen to her come to me complaining about my other crew members our whole shift and then non stop talking about them when we got home. The biggest thing I am thankful for is my job teaching me patience. It was exhausting. Most of the time I would just tune her out when I could, if someone had said something as simple as 'can you be quiet?' She would get triggered and go into rants for days, WEEKS sometimes! About why that person has no room to say anything and everything wrong about them that she could point out. Most of the time when she gas a problem with somebody the only thing she talks about is their looks. Barbara is deeply insecure so points out 'flaws' in every one else to make herself feel just a little bit better. One of the people she has a problem with is somebody who joined my job at the same time I did last year,  we were crew members together and I like to think we are pretty decent friends. I'll call her P. Barbara would constantly make fun of this person's weight and they way she dressed, which is almost all she could ever say. She swore that this person had a problem with her and was convinced that she was trying to get Barbara fired. Barbara had caused some tension between me and this coworker. Now, unfortunately for me, I don't actually hold alot of say-so over my crew and whatnot. And since the whole point of my job is to help people work through their issues, I couldn't really be honest to Barbara. I am a blunt person, and I'm still learning how to communicate without coming off as rude or inconsiderate.  P knows this about me, i had made it clear to my crew last year, they were all very understanding have been very patient with me in times that I have come off the wrong way, we were all able to talk through our problems with each other and get passed them like adults. Every problem with P and i were always just miscommunications, so i had plenty of time to learn and understand P's communication style. Every single time Barbara came to me complaining about P for ""being malicious"" or ""shady"" i would try to explain to Barb that that's not at all what was happening, i know P enough to know that she would not just decide to have a problem with somebody. Just like me, a big responsibility she has is to try and help people. There were multiple times i had explained both parties point's of view to the other and tried to get them to talk and have a conversation about whatever was going on. P was always more than open to talking through it and seeing what she could do differently,  how she could help etc. She focuses alot of growing as a person, so if she make an error, she wants to know so she can learn from that. Barbara would always be against talking to her, flat out saying that she would just get pissed off with P. This was a whole thing for a while. All she ever wanted to do was dog on her for her looks. I understand being insecure, but i will never understand how you can be okay with tearing down everyone elses appearances because you hate yours. Barbara is probably 100 lbs wet and 5'7, shes rather skinny and hate anyone who has a little but of extra weight. Nobody us perfect, i am sure far from it, but i don't see how someone can claim to be self aware, and do the exact same thing ti everyone else that she would never want done to her. It's just cruel. 

This chick, if it wasn't obvious, has issues. The first time she blew up was her and another coworkers were 'working out their differences'. This coworkers also was just as immature as Barbara is. My boss and I sat down with them so they could talk, they eventually started yelling at each other, my bass held Barbara back from the other coworker, other coworkers got fired and had to be escorted out of the building. She got fired because she threatened to assault Barbara. But how Barbara didn't get fired is beyond me, she was as equally as aggressive. After that deescalated Barbara eventually stormed out of the building and walked home. My boss had told me that his requirement for Barb to stay in the program was for her to take a 16 hour anger management course online. Which is not the help she needs, but we can't exactly give her a therapist and diagnoses. The next day when my boss talked to her about doing the course, I had told him it would be best to take her out of the room because I knew how she would react. Sure enough, a few minutes after him going to talk to her, this full grown child started stomping, screaming and crying saying that she didn't  need it and how unfair it was.  Full on toddler tantrum.  

Another instance is her FIRST DAY on the job, she showed one of our project partners her nudes. Ham and everything. Now, he was weirded out by this, but he is also one of those people who would impregnate a hole in the wall if he thought it looked at him the right way. So, the impression he got was she was looking to get some physical attention,  i mean... who shows stranger their nudes photos the first time meeting them? So he would subtly hit on her and asked to buy said photos. She talked to her boyfriend about it and basically told him that this person had accidentally seen her photos, (which were in her locked folder btw) I was there, and just no. She flat out showed him her phone smiling after mentioning that she was comfortable in her body, he looked obviously taken aback at whatever the photo was. It's pretty obvious what that photo was. I also recently found out that she can't use the excuse of him accidentally seeing said photos. So this guy is a mechanic, we'll call him M,  and he has a separate boss who we'll call J, well J was walking up behind M so speak with him, he told me he had seen her bare chest as she was holding her phone up to M. 

After this, M was teaching us the basics of welding, I have been wanting to go into school for welding for a couple of years, so having somebody there to actually teach me how to weld is a blessing. I don't think I have ever mentioned welding school to Barbara, this is important. Well, the first day of us learning how to weld, it was me, Barb and her boyfriend. We were using a stick welder and M said that I was going really good, complimenting a specific line I had done which he said was near perfect, this pissed Barbara off. She has suddenly shut down and quit speaking, M had noticed and asked her if she was okay, to which she just kept responding 'no i'm  pissed off. I don't want to talk about it.' Eventually when M finally quit pressing her about it she had grabbed her drink which was in a glass bottle, walked around the corner, slammed the glass on the ground (our project partners property btw.) And banshee screamed at the top of her lungs before storming off. Her boyfriend had tried calling her and she ignored him, but the second M called her she answered, M had her on speaker phone so I could hear everything she was screaming, she was saying how selfish I am and how much of a bitch I am for trying to one-up her, saying things like I have had the chance to learn welding for a while (i had not lol) and that i could have just gotten Tom to buy me a welding machine because he had money. Meanwhile this post is the first time i even brought up helping her get the job she had because of me, the ID because of me, the social security card because of me, etc. Saying that if it wasn't for her I wouldn't even be welding right now just because she brought up to him that it would be cool to learn. I think she wanted to have one-on-one's with M for the attention. She would flirt with him and ask me weird questions about him and she got pissed off because she can't handle someone getting attention from somebody that she wants attention from. (If that makes sense). I obviously knew how fucking unhinged she was and that she talked shit about everyone, but the moment she said that about me when I have nothing absolutely nothing but help her, I decided I was done with trying with her and I wanted her out of mine and Tom's house. Her boyfriend told her that I heard everything and she came and gave me a fake apology and admitted that she was jealous of me. She said it just made her feel some type of way because M had complimented the bone in the middle of her chest cus shes very insecure about it.  I had told Tom about the incident, specifically where she brought up his money as if it was mine, i think that made us both equally as angry. I'm not somebody who is with a person for money. Tom and i have been best friend for almost a decade and have been romantically together for 4 years. I was also raised extremely independent,  my mother had always drilled into me that I don't need anyone else- especially a man to do things for me. So her insinuating that I could just use his money willy nilly really made me picture how good my fist would look in her throat. The next day Tom told me to go somewhere with him, and he bought me a welding machine to spite Barbara.
 She would also ask me questions like ""is it weird that I get territorial over M?"" Like... yes girl. It's creepy. The only person you should be 'territorial' over, if anyone is your significant other.  Her last day on the job, she was sitting in the mechanic shop distracting M from his work. I was in J's office talking with him about a project, and one of the things he had mentioned to me is that M was on thin I've with not getting things done. So he asked me to have my crew not really interact with M unless it involved fixing something.  As spin as I walked into the shop I could tell she was ticked off about *something* else. So I had just told her that we needed to go up to our office. She looked me in the eyes and very angrily just said ""no!"". On this particular day I didn't care enough to deal with her shit so I just said ""whatever man"" and walked up stairs. I sent her a message saying that she doesn't need to be distracting the mechenic, i had also sent a message to my views group chat plainly stating that J said for us not to really interact with M a whole lot. Not even two minutes later Barbara come stomping up the stairs, into the office and tosses the company laptop on the desks and says ""I'm leaving i don't care if I get in trouble."" At the time I didn't know wtf he'd deal was, so i went down and asked M what had happened. 

Guys, guys... guess why she was so angry. 

I took too many ice packs out of the freezer. XD now! Just for the record, she was in the office all day long working on her anger management course, she also had access to a refrigerator btw. I was outside so, obviously I want my food and water to stay cold. But as a Mature, normal adult, why wouldn't she just tell me that she needed some? Everything always has to be deeper with her. She had literally argued with her boyfriend because he didn't make her a glass of tea while he was getting ready for work. The day after the ice packs incident she got fired, and of course threw a tantrum about that too. She also blamed me for getting her fired, and not her many explosions,  comments about hurting people on the job, her literally showing her named body to our project partners, her causing problems on job sites, just taking no accountability at all. 

Also, i had let her boyfriend use my (brand new) car battery, my truck isn't drivable at the moment and he needed a battery, so i let him borrow it. I had told Barbara to tell her boyfriend that I needed my battery back, it was my mom's and she needed to borrow it to move an old car. This wasn't true, the battery is mine but I had the feeling that if I told her I just wanted it back she would make it hard, and it is unfortunately illegal to open his hood and get it myself. I had originally messaged her that i needed my battery at like 7 in the morning, she was jobless at this point and had all day to tell her boyfriend that he needed to find another battery. That night i reminded her i needed my car battery, telling her that my mom would be there around noon the following day to get it. She responded back with ""okay OP . let me get up at 7:30 at night , since ya know its dark now & get that done ASAP ."" the salt was indeed salty. I just said to myself ""are you f@&king kidding me?"" And a few seconds later she went into mine and Tom's room to talk. she and Tom had a conversation, basically Tom telling her finally what he thought about her and how uncomfortable she made everyone with all the things she has done. For a few days before this she had been texting me things he did (nothing) and telling me that i needed to talk with him, calling him the immature one. I told her if she had something to say to him, she needed to say it. Im not playing middle man and i am definitely not taking the side of someone who projects all of their problems and insecurities onto everyone else. I typed out everything this would be a damn published novel. Right after that conversation she went outside, screamed of course and decided to hit my vehicle with her scrawny little arms and threw her drink at my tire. Fortunately,  my vehicle would hurt her way before she could hurt it, so there were no marks save from a little root beer on my rim. 

I'm actually angry with myself that we didn't have a camera outside at the time, because I would love to press charges on her for trying to damage my property. 

Right after that, her and her boyfriend went to our landlord house to try and get us both kicked out. Now, the landlord has been a phycologist for nearly 20 years, she is extremely good at her job and she can read you like a book the first time you meet her. So she knew exactly what was going on and called me :) the only thing Barbara could say about my boyfriend and I is that apparently we don't clean. Obviously that's not true, we don't clean every single day because we both get home from work and sometimes immediately fall asleep from exhaustion. Meanwhile she gets her boyfriend to buy her weed and just smokes and gossips all day in her room. Anyway, hearing this from the landlord, all I could do was laugh. I began explaining to her everything that's been happening, she immediately cut me off and explained it to me almost word for word. So that saved me ALOT of breath. Barbara thought she was going to be slick and talk shit about us but all she did was expose herself. That night we noticed that she took the microwave she got from a friend who plays in snow. So, Tom and i went to the store, bought a new nice microwave, trash can,  and some groceries. We both can vividly imagine the anger on her face when she walked into the kitchen and saw the new microwave because her trying to inconvenience us and make us mad wasnt working. The next day, i had noticed something of mine was gone, and Barbara had been taking things around the house. Usually, i don't dig through people's things, but there's only one person with sticky fingers who lived with us. So I went into her bedroom, found two things of mine that she had taken, and also to my shock, found Toms package in the back of her closet. I immediately called him and asked him if he asked her to hold the package for him, to which he gave me a very confused ""no?"". I told him i had found the package, he said it was delivered that day around 11am. Side note, i had came back home for 2 minutes to grab something and give Barbara back her crusty whiteboard, she was still home in her room with the door closed. She later said that she had been gone at her mom's house all day. So... what happened then, did somebody break into our house, put the package in her closet and leave? I called the landlord and told her I needed her gone ASAP, I have not had anger issues for about 5 years, I really thought I was going to hurt her when she walked in the house, I have not been so angry in a long time.  Tom helped me calm down a little bit and she got a call from the landlord as she pulled up to the house, she came insode immediately calling me a bitch asking why i went through her room. Hypocrite. I yelled back asking why was my boyfriend's package in her closet. For A split second I saw her face shift to 'oh shit' before she quickly switched back denying and asking what package. Turns out that package was a Christmas present for me Tom had ordered. Since I found it he just had me open it, even though I didn't see what it was, it was still in the USPS packaging. I can only assume 1) she stole it to be petty somehow. Or 2) she saw it was Toms and knew it was probably expensive.  It was, a $300 pair of headphones. He had mentioned open the gift as they were packing their stuff and leaving, i loved it and we grilled hotdogs while they were packing and she was verbally going off the rails. She kicked in a brand new trash can Tom bought, took some things that were Bells, i.e. the tupperware Barb had stolen from Bell before she was evicted.  She took half of Toms seasonings but didn't want the ones she got from her coke head friend. Tom and I now have the house to ourselves and it has been so peaceful.  We turned her old room into our game room and have slowly been buying things for the house, we just got new coffee tables and bed sheets, and are beginning to decorate for Christmas.  Also, something I just remembered is that she would randomly start talking to me about her and her man's sex life, how he didn't satisfy her and how much she compared him to her ex. Which I'm sure he would love to know about. I'm sure he would also like to know about her telling Bell that she would wait until Tom was good and drunk, basically passed out and make sure I walked in on her assaulting him. Do you guys think he would like to know that she sent me photos of her in lingerie? And how much she talked about wanting Tom and how jealous she is of his and my relationship? How about when she slowly applied lotion from her foot to her butt in Bells room while Bell and her boyfriend was under the covers together? There us *alot* of crazy she has done. And in her eyes everyone is wrong in every situation in every way. 

This was... long. I suppose my petty revenge here would be the fact that Barbara used to constantly watch Charlotte. I don't  know of she still does, i don't expect this to get read really. I think I just really wanted to tell someone about it, even if it's to the void of reddit lol. But how great would it be if she saw this post on her screen hahah

Me - I’m 31. I would hope I’m shorter than you. I have to use a little effort to reach dem top shelves at the store. I love concerts. I’ve been to two this year and already have tickets for two shows next year. I workout often. Hiking is my happy place. I feel weird when I’m not active. I’m not one of those weirdos that says they never eat junk tho (those people lie). If you do Keto maybe don’t respond to me lol I’m an epileptic so that was actually made for my people and lemme tell ya, for the sake of your heart, stop or go see your GP about your LDL. Anywhooo - like I mentioned about the hike I did. I love the outdoors. I hike almost daily and am lucky to live near the trail. I don’t drive anymore being that I am an epileptic. I’ve totaled one car too many from a seizure, I’m good. I cook and bake really well not to toot my own horn. I freaking love animals. I will absolutely ask to pet your dogs on the trail when they go by me. I’m a coffee addict and that’s okay with me. I live in a 3 bedroom townhouse with one roommate. Oh, my only maybe heck no for you - I’ve got like a quarter shaved head that I intend to keep that way for a while. Totally understand that isn’t everyone’s vibe. Okay, enough about me. 


Please don’t message me if you’re cheating or if you’re someone whose reddit history is just filled with questionable things. I’m good. Hard pass. My only big ask is that you’re stable in life and you’re no more than a year younger than me and maybe 10 years older. 


To let me know you actually read this - maybe tell me how you take your coffee or if you’re magical and don’t need caffeine.",1,1732577272.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

1gzx8xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1gzx8xr/does_this_mean_anything_is_she_interested_library/,Does this mean anything? Is she interested? Library Crush (female gaze),"There’s this girl I’ve been seeing at the library for the past four weeks. We’re aware of each other but have never been formally introduced. She has a close friend who once gave me a ride because it was on her way (I’ll get back to her friend later). About four weeks ago, I found her and her 2–3 friends sitting at my usual table. I noticed out of the corner of my eye that she kept glancing at me—turning her head 90 degrees to the right for a few seconds at a time, then repeating it every few minutes. 

At first, I thought she might just find me exotic (as many do since I’m foreign, have kind of an accent, a dark beard, and wavy long hair). She usually talks to her friends by mouthing words, but since this started, I’ve noticed that sometimes she texts her friends instead, and they also glance at me after reading her messages. Interestingly, her close friend (the one who gave me a ride) started saying hi and waving at me whenever she saw me on campus recently. Sometimes, when my girl is chatting with her friends, and I start talking to someone who stops by to greet me, she diverts all her attention to me by turning her head 180. I thought my distinct accent might be part of the attraction as she hardly finds me speaking. 

On a few occasions, when this girl wasn’t at the table, her friends would still be there. Right after I arrived, I noticed her friends texting, and within minutes, she would show up to chat with them. It felt like she came to see me because she would glance my way, and her friends would make brief eye contact with me as if acknowledging I was part of the topic. About two weeks ago, this routine became almost daily. She even rested her butt very close to my elbow on the table to chat with her friends and looked back at me a few times. 

Another day, I assumed she had left when she packed and got up because it was late, but when I was chatting with a few other girls who passed by my table, I felt like someone was staring at me. When I looked toward the exit, I saw her waiting with another friend, talking but looking at me; looked as if she was almost in awe. 

Since then, though, I feel like she might see this as a distraction. Over the past week, she hasn’t been sitting at the table regularly. She still occasionally comes to talk to her friends and sneaks a few glances my way, but it’s been less frequent. Last week, I went upstairs to grab coffee and saw her there talking to another girl. When we locked eyes for a solid five seconds, she completely stopped speaking, and her friends turned to see what was happening. They gave her a look like, “He’s here!” She had the same expression on her face as the one I mentioned last time.

Am I overthinking this? I do get female gazes here and there, but it usually doesn’t last this long. Other girls that occasionally sit near that table and glance at me, their attention doesn’t last more than 2–3 days since I don’t reciprocate. Could this actually mean something? Should I make a move? I looked her up, and she’s attractive and seems to check the boxes for what I’m looking for. A friend who has seen some of these interactions went from thinking I was being delusional to saying she was clearly interested and that I should approach her.

He denied the warranty and said I need to contact the manufacturer.  All in all Walmarts warranty thru Allstate is complete garbage and I feel a scam.

1gzx74f,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1gzx74f/thats_a_macchiato/,That's a Macchiato.,"Don't you just hate it when people tell you how to do your job? I'm a very patient guy but I cannot stress how infuriated I was when a lady at my drive-thru window said in plain english that she wanted a solo espresso macchiato, which I had made, and upon receiving said drink she didn't even try to be nice. She went full force on accusing me of making her macchiato wrong on the basis of it having milk.

... That's a macchiato.

The worst part is I didn't even get an explanation from her, it took the man in the driver seat saying ""It's usually just a tiny bit of coffee in the cup"" to realize she just wanted a solo shot of espresso. Now I'm more than happy to help others understand how to order precisely what they want, I want them to be happy! It's when I try to accommodate as much as I can and you still have the nerve to be disrespectful that I deem you beyond help.

I explained to her calmly that what she was looking for was a solo shot of espresso, and that a macchiato is milk foam spotted with espresso. We can't always be faulted for not knowing everything, there's always new opportunities to learn, so I said I'd remake it for her at no charge. Despite everything I had done to make the experience worthwhile, she tried angrily correcting me that a macchiato was a shot of espresso and that I needed to be retrained. 

Normally I would just sit there and take it, but after months of being subjected to situations like these I took one of the store's IPads and pulled up the store resources for the recipe to the espresso macchiato, which was exactly as I described it previously to her. ""I'm not reading that"" was her response. Some people just wake up angry.

1gzx6vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1gzx6vv/i_ruined_xmas/,I Ruined Xmas,"I've been wanting to decorate for Christmas the past two weeks, but every day I'm off work the chores are piled up so that by the time the house is clean and all my chores are done, I'm too tired and sore to decorate. 

Last night I got home from my 12 hour shift and my husband was sweet enough to have the house decorated. It was really nice and he did a good job, but he didn't touch any of the chores. He had my cute little Christmas village set up on the coffee table without moving the old coke cans and candy wrappers.. He had the kitchen decorated nicely but left all the dirty dishes in the sink. The cats litter boxes weren't done and their water was the old stuff from yesterday.

He was tired from decorating all day so I had to clean the kitchen, make supper and do the litter boxes. At this point I finally just lost it and yelled at him ""WHY DID YOU DECORATE A DIRTY HOUSE??? WHY COULDNT YOU HAVE JUST CLEANED FOR ME SO I COULD ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING FUN ON MY DAY OFF INSTEAD OF ALWAYS FUCKING CLEANING"" I knew it was out of line and uncalled for as soon as I finished screaming it but it was too late. I hurt his feelings really bad.

He pulled down the tree and put it back in its box, ripped the decorations down and put them all back in the garage. I'm not surprised, I was a real cunt. If someone spoke to me that way I'd have done the same thing. 

I tried apologizing over and over. I tried asking him to leave the decorations up and I was trying to just get him to wait for a second because I knew I was wrong but he just hauled everything down. 

This was 6:00 last night, it's now qlmost 8:00. 26 hours. I've apologized so many times since then but hes just been ignoring me. The most I got out of him was that we aren't doing Christmas this year or ever again. 

My father in law (who we care for) and my sister in law and her boyfriend all live with us. I've been at the end of my rope taking care of all of them and I think I just snapped but I know it's not excuse at all for acting like I did.

I just wish he knew how sorry I was. I feel like an abusive partner because of how I blew up and on top of that I don't know what else to do but be nice and isn't that called love bombing?? I'm afraid to stay quiet because it'll look like I'm still mad but I'm not. But I'm also afraid to speak up because he's so pissed off with me. I just want to hold him until his pain goes away but he won't let me anywhere near him. 

I know I was in the wrong 100% for being so mean but when is it long enough to be given the silent treatment. I didn't want to come home from work today. ",2,1732576930.0,rant,4,1.0,False

1gzx1zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gzx1zo/trying_to_understand_how_bitcoin_actually_will/,Trying to understand how Bitcoin actually will work,"Bitcoin gets a lot of hype. You hear these amazing stories about people paying off debts, buying mansions, or finally living their dream life—all because they bought Bitcoin early. It sounds great! But when you think about it, doesn’t someone’s “win” mean someone else is “losing”?

When you sell your Bitcoin at a profit, someone else is buying it at a higher price. And unlike stocks or real estate, which have intrinsic value (like dividends or rent), Bitcoin doesn’t produce anything on its own. Its value comes mostly from speculation. So, where does this lead us?

# Scenario 1: The Bubble Bursts

Bitcoin keeps growing in price as more people buy into the hype, thinking it’ll just keep going up. But if confidence drops (maybe due to regulations, better alternatives, or tech issues), the bubble could burst. And when it does, late buyers are stuck holding the bag while early adopters cash out big.

If this happens, isn’t it just a huge wealth transfer? The majority pays for the gains of a few. Feels like the textbook definition of a bubble, right? And honestly, how is that sustainable or even fair?

# 2. Bitcoin Becomes a Real Currency

Okay, let’s imagine Bitcoin is adopted everywhere as a legit way to pay for things. That’s cool in theory, but… how does this actually work?

# Who’s Selling the Bitcoin?

For Bitcoin to function as a currency, people need to access it, but the supply is heavily concentrated.

* **Early adopters:** A small group of people who bought Bitcoin early hold a significant portion of the total supply. If they decide to sell, they profit massively while latecomers pay a premium. This could lead to a huge inequality, where a few control most of the new financial system. So back to the current situation with Fiat. 
* **Corporations:** Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla hold large amounts of Bitcoin. If they control the supply, do we really have a decentralized currency, or is it just shifting control from banks to corporations? (and governments). 
* **Hidden stashes:** Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, owns over 1 million BTC. If that Bitcoin were ever moved or sold, it could destabilize the market, tanking the price and causing panic. Similarly with the lost stashes. 

The concentration of Bitcoin compromises its idea of decentralization and fairness in my opinion. 

# Volatility

Bitcoin’s price swings wildly—one week it’s up 20%, the next it’s down 30%.

* **For businesses:** Pricing goods in Bitcoin becomes a nightmare. A cup of coffee might cost 0.0003 BTC today and 0.00025 BTC tomorrow. Businesses would need to adjust prices constantly, creating confusion for customers.
* **For salaries:** Imagine earning your paycheck in Bitcoin and waking up to find its value dropped by 15%. How do you plan for expenses like rent or groceries?

Even if adoption stabilizes Bitcoin’s value, it’s unclear if it can ever be stable enough for everyday use. And this volatility could actually be a weapon, think about it, nowadays China doesn't have the power to destabilize the US's economy because they don't control the dollar, but if they hold a significant amount of BTC and suddenly drop it to the market at a critical moment, they could destabilize the whole economy and weaponize the financial market. 

# Transaction Costs and Speed

Bitcoin’s technical limitations make it less practical as a global currency:

* **Transaction fees:** Fees rise with network congestion. During busy periods, sending Bitcoin can cost $20 or more. Paying high fees for small transactions, like buying a coffee, isn’t sustainable. 
* **Speed:** Bitcoin processes about 7 transactions per second (TPS). Compare that to Visa’s 24,000 TPS. Without significant improvements, Bitcoin simply can’t handle the scale of global usage.

# Deflation

Probably the most important one. Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it deflationary, which creates its own set of problems:

* **Hoarding:** If Bitcoin is expected to increase in value over time, people will hoard it instead of spending it. Why buy a car today if your Bitcoin might buy a better one next year? This slows down the economy, as spending and investment are critical for growth.
* **Debt:** Deflation makes debt more expensive to repay because the value of money increases. Borrowers would face mounting financial pressure, discouraging loans and investments. Why would I lend you BTC if probably holding it will give a better yield?
* **Wage stagnation:** Businesses might struggle to adjust wages to match the increasing value of Bitcoin, leading to stagnant salaries and lower purchasing power.

A deflationary currency can hurt economic growth and create a system where wealth becomes even more concentrated. In the end, many of people's investments are driven by inflation, you invest to keep you money growing and protected against inflation. 

# Energy Consumption

Bitcoin’s PoW system requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems, which consumes a massive amount of energy.

* If Bitcoin were adopted globally, its energy consumption could skyrocket, adding strain to power grids and increasing carbon emissions.
* Some argue that miners will transition to renewable energy, but there’s no guarantee this will happen fast enough to avoid significant environmental impact.

This raises ethical questions about whether Bitcoin’s benefits justify its environmental costs.

# Regulation

Governments won’t easily give up control of monetary systems. Bitcoin threatens central banks’ ability to manage monetary policy, such as controlling inflation or responding to economic crises.

* **Bans:** Some governments, like China, have already banned Bitcoin mining or transactions. Others might follow if Bitcoin becomes too disruptive.
* **Regulation:** Governments could impose heavy restrictions on Bitcoin usage, making it difficult to adopt on a large scale. For example, they could require identity verification for transactions, undermining Bitcoin’s promise of privacy.

If Bitcoin faces widespread regulation, it could lose its appeal as a decentralized and borderless currency. 

# Access and Usability

Even today, using Bitcoin isn’t easy for the average person.

* **Technical barriers:** Setting up wallets, securing private keys, and navigating exchanges are complicated processes. One mistake—like losing your private key—and your Bitcoin is gone forever.
* **Digital divide:** Accessing Bitcoin requires internet connectivity and technical knowledge, which isn’t available to everyone. This could exclude large parts of the global population, especially in developing countries.

To succeed as a currency, Bitcoin needs to become far more user-friendly and accessible.

**What’s the Endgame?**  
While Bitcoin’s vision of a decentralized, global currency is inspiring, these challenges make it difficult for me to imagine it replacing traditional money anytime soon. Is it a store of value like gold or a currency for daily use? If it’s not practical for payments, does it lose its purpose?

I’d love to hear your thoughts.

I come to the hive mind today with two predicaments I find myself in. Which seems like it might be going around but I just need to vent my frustrations into the void of internet space where some fellow dads going through similar stuff can weigh in. Apologies in advance for the length. 

First, I am definitely feeling that isolation hard. The isolation of being a dad when your friends aren’t. My wife has friends she tries to get coffee with on occasion which I am always fine with. I want her to have that time and it lets her have some female friend time from longtime friends and former colleagues. I also have a loose friend group but since we’re nerds that usually involves long form card games like MTG or playing video games. My friend group has been in a drought of multiplayer video games we want to play together and I feel guilty trying to schedule time to get together and play Magic or something since it usually takes so long and goes well into the night versus a cup of coffee. Moreover, none of my individual friends are parents yet. So I do often get invited to golf or come hang out but often last minute or partway through the week of when it’s happening. As we dads know, schedules are key. I mostly can’t just drop our schedules out routine without some prep work. It just gets hard to manage and I often feel left out. 

Second, I feel like my wife might not find me attractive anymore and I’m not sure how to broach the subject. We have a lot going on right now so I can’t do it immediately but I know I have to communicate it to her at some point because it’s eating me up. I tell her all the time how gorgeous she looks, how cute she looks at a particular time, the whole nine and I truly mean it. But I’ve been thinking lately that I can’t actually remember the last time she complimented me without me prompting it. We don’t have a dead bedroom and our intimacy has been off the charts lately for the most part which makes me question my thoughts on this. But then at the same time there have been dry spells where she complains we could be having more intimate time but has never made much of an effort to initiate it herself. We had a brief period where the initiation was more mutual but now it seems like if intimacy is to happen it is back on me to initiate or it just won’t occur. Neither of our physiques have changed much since marriage and having kids so if the attraction is going away I can’t place why. If someone has had experience with feeling this and found a way to have a constructive discussion regarding this I would appreciate it. ",3,1732576559.0,daddit,3,1.0,False

recently at a work event i connected with a guy whom works in the same field as me. 
While chatting he asked if we could exchange socials. I didnt want to give him my number or contact but he insisted and passed me my his phone. When i saw his lockscreen of him hugging some kids  i was like “aw theyre so cute! are they your nephews?” he corrected me and said “nope i am a daddy!” immediately that gave me the ick but what he said right after made me want to vomit
“possible step mamis as cute as you are hard to find these days tho..we could go on a play date if u want” 
i handed him his phone back quickly and made some bs excuse to go back to my team.

I noticed he had no ring on and the kids looked nothing older than maybe 6 or 8 years old.
I put a fake number as my contact and noticed he kept circling around my team until the event ended. 
Before i left he came up to me once again and asked me if I’d be interested in grabbing a coffee, i declined and made my way out once again.

Today at my job’s morning meeting a couple of my coworkers brought up how they saw me talking to him and “giving him my number”  but also commented how this guy also tried flirting with a couple of them as well.


Personally I would *never* *ever* go for a single dad because i simply want to be first priority when it comes to my relationship. I found it very odd he actually tried to flirt with me even when i found out he was a father.
It grossed me out how he used his kids to make it sound like I would be interested in him because he has them…. but after chatting with a girlfriend she mentioned how she didnt care and that shed look for other characteristics before voting him off as undesirable…

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

But my reaction wasn’t of anger or resentment—it was of gratitude. Grateful for the opportunity, grateful for what I had learned, and for the people I met along the way.

But here’s the thing: just before I was laid off, two major events caught my attention. First, a massive wave of layoffs in the tech sector, and second, the bankruptcy of a bank. It hit me hard: **no job is a guarantee**, and anyone can be let go without warning.

That realization was a wake-up call. I immediately began saving, paying off all my debts, and cutting out unnecessary expenses—goodbye expensive food and coffee. I started applying to architecture firms, even though deep down, I didn’t want to work for anyone anymore. I was already working on launching my business, but I wasn’t even close to being ready.

During this time, I took the chance to reflect on what I would do if I were laid off. **Little did I know that it would actually happen to me.**

When it did, I wasn’t shocked. I was actually prepared. In my heart, I knew it was time to **go all-in on my business**, because I had this deep sense that it was the right move. I was burnt out from working in corporate America. Despite the negativity of my situation—being underpaid, overworked, and not satisfied with my role—I had to focus on the positives.

I realized how much I had learned. I was in a unique position, hearing high-level conversations about investments and money moves, learning how to think like a billionaire. I gained insights into flipping large buildings in NYC, worked with some amazing and talented people, and was blessed to have an incredible supervisor and mentor, **Mr. Olu Ojeyemi**. I also had the pleasure of meeting wonderful people in payroll, accounting, and a good friend, **Linda Diaz**.

I thank God for that opportunity. It was the perfect stepping stone in my journey, and I will forever be grateful.

Fast forward to after I was laid off: I ran out of money, but my business started to gain momentum. However, it wasn’t easy. I didn’t land any job at architecture firms, despite applying to 400+ places, including IBM. I had a couple of interviews but didn’t get hired.

That’s when my good friend reached out—he was about to launch a dispensary in Soho, and he asked me if I’d help out as front desk. It was humbling. Here I was, an architect with a degree, working a front desk job—but I didn’t care about the title. I cared about the money. I had rent to pay, student loans to cover, and a business to fund.

If I had let my pride control me, I could have ended up on the streets. Pride would have taken me nowhere good. Instead, I humbled myself and learned valuable lessons. From trusting God more deeply to focusing on my business and finding peace in the middle of the storm, I’ve grown.

And you know what? My lifestyle hasn’t changed much. I’m still the same person I was before—still humble, still grounded. I came from the bottom, worked my ass off to get my degree in architecture, balanced two jobs while going to school, and commuted 4 hours a day. I’m not better than anyone, and no job title or position will ever change that.

It’s all about the journey, the growth, and the lessons. Stay humble, stay grateful, and trust the process.",1,1732575752.0,u_wlady4000,0,1.0,False

I’m 33, 6’0”, and living in Maine, where the trees outnumber people. Seriously, Maine is the most forested state in the U.S., and that’s where I was born and raised. I’m a lean 180 pounds (usually closer to 165, but let’s blame the munchies for the extra padding).

A bit about me:
Personality: Imagine a mix of dark humor, laid-back vibes, and a slightly Gothic twist. That’s me. I’m the guy who enjoys the irony in horror movies and laughs at life’s absurdities. But don’t worry, I’m not all doom and gloom; I just appreciate life from a different angle. If you’re into sarcasm and don’t take life too seriously, we’ll get along just fine.

Hobbies: If you like comedy and horror flicks, we’ll have plenty to binge-watch together. I’m also a gamer with a PS5, currently surviving Call of Duty. Not a gamer? No big deal, I’m open to trying new things and sharing different interests. I think it’s exciting when two people can introduce each other to new experiences.

Bonus points if you love a good breakfast. I’ve also got a knack for cooking up a killer breakfast, pancakes, bacon, the works. If you’re into lazy Sunday mornings, I’ve got you covered.

What I’m looking for:
Connection: I’m drawn to women who speak their mind and aren’t afraid to get real. Whether we’re vibing over shared interests or learning from our differences, I’m here for it. If you’ve got a sharp wit and a playful side, I’ll be hooked.

Energy: I believe that making an effort is sexy. Let’s start with a voice or video chat. It’s more personal and fun than just texting. Plus, if we’re willing to step out of our comfort zones, who knows what kind of adventures we could end up on together?

Open-Mindedness: I’m not looking for a mirror image of myself. In fact, I think it’s way more fun if we’re a bit different. It keeps things interesting, and it means we’ll never run out of things to talk about or do together.

Let’s be real, physical attraction matters. I believe in being upfront and getting that out of the way early. Let’s exchange pictures as soon as possible so we can both know if we feel that spark. It’s important to me to build something genuine, and that starts with knowing there’s mutual attraction.

I also love cuddling, watching movies, and being affectionate. I want a partner who’s not afraid to express themselves emotionally and intimately. Deep conversations, daily texting, and phone calls are my kind of connection. If you’re the kind of person who loves to share their feelings and stay close, we’ll be a great match.

The Essentials:
I’ve got a job and my life together, and I’m hoping you do too. A solid work ethic is a major turn-on for me. I’ve done the long-distance thing before, so if you’re from another state, no worries, we can make it work if the chemistry is there.

I’m looking for someone to join me in discovering the best hidden spots in town, whether it’s a new coffee shop, a haunted house, or the perfect hiking trail. Let’s make some memories together.

So, what do you say? Want to see if we can make each other laugh? Or maybe I’ll just have to show you that my breakfast skills are no joke.",1,1732575659.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

1gzwnwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1gzwnwb/should_i_reach_out_or_move_on/,Should I reach out or move on? ,"I’m a 27-year-old guy, average height, not overly muscular, but I try to stay in shape. I work in marketing and have been busy with work lately. I’m single, not really looking, but not completely closed off either. I’ve been on a couple of Bumble and Hinge dates here and there—nice people, decent conversations—but nothing really clicked.

A few months ago, I started going to this small park near my gym to unwind after my workouts. It became my go-to spot.

One day, I noticed a girl sitting on a bench reading a book. She looked pretty chill, with loose, curly hair and a laid-back vibe. She smiled when I walked by, so I decided to stop and ask her about the book she was reading. We hit it off right away—it felt easy to talk to her, like we’d known each other longer.

After that, I’d see her there most mornings, usually sitting with her book or sometimes sketching. We’d talk for a bit, and eventually, she suggested we hang out sometime and gave me her number. I texted her later that day, and we ended up making plans to grab coffee at a place she liked.

When we met up, it was honestly one of the best conversations I’ve had in a long time. The chemistry between us was undeniable—it felt intense and natural, like there was something deeper right from the start. We talked about everything—movies, random life experiences—and laughed a lot. I couldn’t help but notice how easy it was to connect with her. It felt like we were on the same wavelength, and I could hardly take my eyes off her. But then, toward the end of the date, she got a little quieter and said, “I need to tell you something.”

She admitted she had a boyfriend. She said their relationship had been off for a while and that they were both in a place where things just weren’t connecting anymore. She hadn’t told me earlier because she didn’t want me to think less of her.

In that moment, I told her how I felt—that I liked her—but that the situation was a bit too complicated for me. I said I wasn’t sure if we should be spending time together while she was still in a relationship. She said she hadn’t expected to feel such a strong connection with someone else and apologized for making things complicated and wasting my time. 

We didn’t talk after that. But about a week later, I ran into her at the park. She saw me and came over to say hi. We chatted for a bit, and she told me she’d broken up with her boyfriend and really hoped I didn’t think she was a bad person. She said she respected the boundaries I’d set.

It’s been two months now, and I haven’t seen her around. She has not posted anything on social media lately, so I really don’t know what’s going on with her. I’m not sure if she’s avoiding me or if she’s just taking space to figure things out. Either way, I feel like she might be giving me space, but I wonder if it’s also because seeing me might stir up too many emotions for her.

I like her, but my life’s been hectic with work and personal stuff, and I’ve also been talking to other people lately—nothing serious, but there are definitely other options I could pursue. I’m just not sure if I should reach out to her again or move on.

Should I text her? Should I just let it go and move on? Do you think she emotionally cheated on her boyfriend by opening up to me like that?",2,1732575546.0,datingadvice,3,1.0,False
1gzwnd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1gzwnd4/cocaine_chamomile/,Cocaine & Chamomile,"**One thing I'm thankful for this during this week of reflection:** the awesome variety of activities and adventures my sugar girlfriend and I experience.

This last weekend we escaped to a mountain retreat.  We started the day with vinyasa yoga (my first time) followed by clay shooting all afternoon (her first time). We hiked up a mountain with a 5K+ foot elevation, and we sipped wine together in a bath.  We took a private horseback ride through the woods during the day, and made love under the stars at night.

I'm a morning person and wake up before her; I made coffee and replied to work emails while she eased her way into the day.  She's a night owl and kept the fire going in the fireplace and posted her adventures to Insta while I drifted off to sleep each night.

During dinner last night, we amused ourselves with how intense and fun our relationship is.  She said it was *guns and yoga*.  I said *cocaine and chamomile* was a more apt description, since we started our trip with a trip and ended each night with decaffeinated tea.  😝

1gzwn8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone16ProMax/comments/1gzwn8e/issues_with_cellular_radio/,Issues with cellular radio?,"Anyone else have issues with data speed performance and connectivity with their 16 Pro Max? I upgraded from a 15 PM and didn’t have any issues with it. I’ve been on AT&T for many years, so no change in provider. I just notice that often I get slower speeds (often significantly slower) in the same places I’m used to going with the 16PM. I also see it drop to 5G+ or LTE service a lot more often. 

This shows as delays in sending pics over messages, downloading photos, etc. As an example, today I’m sitting in a coffee shop I’ve been to many times. I have an iPad Pro 11 M2 with cellular connectivity. It shows full bars 5G and SpeedTest gives me 722 Mbps down and 72 Mbps up. Tested on 16 PM (which shows LTE even after toggling airplane mode on/off) and it gives me 23 Mbps down and 11 Mbps up.

It’s inconsistent, as sometimes I see expected performance on the iPhone. I don’t have it in low power mode, nor do I have any restrictions set on the cellular data.",1,1732575495.0,iPhone16ProMax,0,1.0,False
