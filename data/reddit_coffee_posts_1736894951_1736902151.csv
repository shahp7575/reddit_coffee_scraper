1i1kydk,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntrovertDating/comments/1i1kydk/25_f4a_nceast_coast_because_why_not/,25 [F4A] NC/East Coast - Because Why Not?,"I'm an East Coast-based, city-dwelling introvert (25F, 5'1""). I'm a homebody who enjoys the simple pleasures and the freedom that comes with being childfree (non-negotiable)—doing what I want, when I want (even if that's nothing at all!): curling up with a good book, occasional gaming sessions, binge-watching shows, planning my next vacation spot, trying new recipes or perfecting old favorites, hanging out with my two cats, and taking quality naps. While I can be outgoing, I ultimately need my downtime to recharge. You won't find me camping, hiking, or running a marathon—I prefer my adventures in or near civilization with AC, tasty food, and a proper cup of coffee or tea.

So, that's a basic summary of me. I'm looking for someone (preferably between the ages of 25-35) who understands the value of engaging discussions, can share their passions, and brings their own interesting perspectives to the table. I enjoy deep, thought-provoking conversations and silly, lighthearted banter—as long as there's substance behind it.

1i1kwht,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1i1kwht/giving_her_my_number/,Giving her my number???,"So ive been talking to this girl over instagram and earlier today asked her if she’d ever like to get coffee sometime, she agreed, and now I’m wondering if I give her my number or just stick to instagram texting.

im fine with either but instagram is hard to have conversations on and it’s a lot easier to text over messenger.

She told me to let her know whenever im free to meet up so I was gonna say something like “awesome, I’ll definitely let you know soon! Btw here’s my number if you wanna use it for esier communication.”

it’s a bit janky but I think it works right? Or should I just make plans over instagram meet her in person and then give my number?",1,1736900702.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

**1. Slower Brewing:** It used to brew within a few seconds of pressing the button, but now it takes about a minute to brew, even with a full water reservoir.

**2. Less Coffee Output: I** always use the medium button, which used to fill about half of my coffee mug. Now it only fills about a quarter, even though nothing else has changed.

Has anyone experienced this before? ChatGPT suggested descaling, but I’ve never done that. I’m open to other suggestions. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated!",1,1736900380.0,keurig,0,1.0,False
1i1kse3,https://www.reddit.com/r/sapiosexuals/comments/1i1kse3/a_satirical_short_story_i_wrote_about_a_character/,A satirical short story I wrote about a character becoming self aware (thought this community would enjoy it and the jokes would land ) ,"What time should we leave to be there on time ?” Corey asked from his position at the kitchen table .                                                                 
It was early morning, but Tessa and her boyfriend had risen and started their day happily . They were going over plans for the weekend . Corey liked to keep a tight itinerary and always made sure that the two stayed on track .                                                                            
Tessa had been making breakfast and coffee for them both as her partner made the “To do List,”. She carefully cut the stick of salted butter into even slices before adding a few to the pan . It took a minute or so, but the butter started to melt . She loved the way melted butter smelled because it could be flavored any way and still be good .                
Butter was a precursor to any food she cooked and she thought about its importance to the quality of a dish . Butter is used to sauté, fry, bake , flavor , and in sauces. She watched it sizzle a little before breaking two eggs over the hot pan .                                    
After getting the eggs on , she grabbed the bread from the counter and popped two pieces into the toaster oven . Butter would also be used to spread on their toast . The importance of butter was really unmatched .                                                                             
She turned to get the milk out of the refrigerator and headed over to her favorite place in their apartment , the coffee nook . Corey had only complained a little when she asked him to custom build the unit that would become an aesthetically pleasing piece of furniture for their home . She looked back at him for a minute , pen in hand , looking at something in his phone . It was likely the invitation to the gala they’d been invited to . He would ensure he knew everything they needed to know before their arrival this evening . He was always prepared .                                                                  
Tessa opened the cabinet and pulled out two mugs , positioning one underneath the espresso machine . She grabbed the milk to add to the steamer , but stopped when she noticed several gnats flying around the pot . She wrinkled her nose .                                                                                   
How many of them were there ? She realized that there were spots of dried up coffee spillage stuck to the base of the machine . She grabbed a dish cloth to clean the mess .                                                   
“I think it was 7pm, though I’m sure you already figured that out . Where did all of these fruit flies come from ?” She finally responded to her boyfriend who dutifully continued his own task without waiting for her to answer.                                     
He looked up at her . She seemed bewildered . She was buzzing about the kitchen like the little flying insects she had mentioned , from one place to another .                                                                              
Corey answered her , but Tessa didnt acknowledge him .                                                                                     
“Have you seen my glasses ?” She asked him for the third time that morning . He laughed and pointed to her head where they were resting , holding back her hair . What would she do without him ?                                                                                    
She looked at the gnats for longer than anyone normally would . These little bugs were feeding off of espresso . It felt wrong ! It was the equivalent of giving a pound of cocaine to a child . She chuckled to herself , not caring when Corey gave her a look of concern.                                                                         
**”Oh no the giant is wiping up the nectar!” Freud screamed . His wings were erratic and he almost dived right into a dark hole that the large creature had pulled from an unknown place .                                  
“She seems like she won’t hurt us, we may be able to get a little bit more before it is all gone!” Jung , Freud’s slightly younger brother yelled back !                       
Freud couldn’t resist his impulse , he knew it was dangerous, but he dived anyway . The nectar was too good . His mind was fluttering back and forth as to whether or not this was a good idea , but it was his body that betrayed him .                                      
Jung flew around in circles , hovering before joining his brother . All of the other gnats following their lead .                                                                            
“The giantess is looking at us, we must hurry . “ Freud observed . “This stuff is just too good . I feel like I could knock her down if I tried !”                           
Jung took his own helping of the bitter nectar , he understood the energetic feeling that his brother was feeling and wondered if others felt it too . Were they all struggling between the choice of obtaining more food and the likelihood that the large figure would bring them certain death .                  
Freud was the first to pull away . “I don’t think this is good for us .” He buzzed higher and higher until he was as far away from the sticky sweetness as he could be .                                                                      
Jung laughed . “You’re right . It made you feel invincible against an impossible adversary.”
Freud flew back and forth as fast as he could . “I feel like I could do anything right now .”                             
“Children please, please . Take no more . It is affecting our minds ,” Piaget yelled. He flew in a figure eight around the group of youngest gnats , gathering them up , and studying how they behaved .                                                                             
“Weeeee, look at me ! I’m really really fast!” One of them said !                                                                        
“We want more! More ! More!” The youngest of the bunch excitedly yelled!                                                     
“Oh don’t be such a hero— we all know that you’re the caregiver!” Jung exclaimed . Piaget annoyed him . Was his younger brother acting out of character , or was a caregiver also a hero ?                   
“Jung is right . I’d like to see how they behave after eating the substance,” Watson , who hadn’t had any of the nectar , decided .                                               
The children dipped down to lick up the black goo and let their wings carry them towards their elders .                                                                               
“I want you all to fly as fast as you can,” Pavlov directed . He also had not had any food yet .               
The children , and some adults , did as they were told .                                                                                      
“More ! More!” They cheered .                                         
“Whatever . I guess Pavlov is in charge now,“ Piaget said .                                                                                   
“We can only get the nectar when the giantess has her back turned .” Pavlov directed all of the others .
The giant began to move back towards whatever smelled so good far away from the food they’d been enjoying . Pavlov thought that the adults could have some of that next .                                        
“Her back is turned. Let’s go !” Everyone dived down to get whatever they could before their new deadline .                                                                           
Each time they did , Pavlov did not move . He just began to sing loudly .                                                      
“Lalalala!”                                                                           
The group flew down to get more!                                       
As the giant moved around the planet , Pavlov continued this pattern of singing each time their back was turned .                                                              
“Lalala!”                                                                             
This happened over and over until all of the gnats were taking part.                                                                 
Just then his brother, Zimbardo, had an idea .
Zimbardo sung “lalala!” as loud as he could, but the giantesses back was not turned .                        

All of the gnats descended to the nectar , where they were smashed by a large white blanket that the creature was wielding .                                             
He laughed as he watched hot liquid pour into the large white colored tunnel that had been sitting beside the nectar pit .                                                      
“Guess Freud was wrong , we aren’t stronger than the giant .”**.                                                                              
“Hello earth to Tessa! The eggs are burning !” Corey broke Tessa out of her day dream .                         
She ran to the eggs , but Corey had already saved them .                                                                            In the time it took to cook two eggs and two pieces of toast , she’d held a conversation , had deep thoughts about the culinary wonders of butter , found her glasses , vividly daydreamed a life for psychologist gnats , cleaned the kitchen and gotten rid of most of the pests , confirmed plans , and made cappuccino’s.                                       
 
She stared out of the window at the snowy foliage, watching a squirrel scurry up a tree . She thought about the crazy little guy from the movie ice age , before turning her attention to spreading butter on the toast and plating the meal .                                     
As she set the table for the both of them, she sat down next to Corey, giggling .                                          
“What ?” He smiled .                                                         
“I think I have some kind of attention disorder. You know neurodivergence?”                                                 
Corey laughed uncontrollably , handing her the glasses he’d helped her locate , that she had taken off of her head and set down again .

Feeling defeated. I think my 6 week old has colic. 

I am a STM and did not experience any of this first time around. 

My baby is 6 weeks old today and this experience thus far has been brutal. Ever since my baby has been 3 weeks of age he has been crying constantly anytime he is awake. Before every feeding (which is understandable - he is hungry), during the feeding and after the feeding. I will burp him and while he will burp he continues to cry. I’ve tried different burping techniques. I’ve tried feeding him an ounce and then burp. I’ve done bicycles and belly rubs and while gas will be passed he still cries. I’ve tried different feeding positions and I’ve tried different bottles. He is mainly fed breastmilk via breast and bottle. It does not matter if it is on breast or bottle. I’ve tried feeding, changing the diaper, offering a pacifier, swinging, rocking and bouncing. Skin to skin, cuddling, tummy rubs. He does seem to like baths/showers. I’ve tried gas drops. I recently (like today) just purchased hypoallergic formula from enfamil. The formulas I have supplemented with (enfamil yellow and the gentleease), I purchased gripe water (although there is little research to back it up that it helps) but I couldn’t give it to him bc it said not to give to a crying baby or mix with formula/breastmilk. I am currently removing dairy from my diet. I am also ordering probiotics for him. As of recent (last week) he went an entire week without pooping. While I understand that most breastmilk fed babies poop less something in my mom gut told me something was off. I bought the Frida windi and when I used it he pooped…and a lot of poop came out. I’ve been in contact with his pediatrician. She is advising to remove dairy from my diet. 

I don’t know what else to do. I feel so sad seeing him in pain my heart breaks. He looks so sad. I cannot stop crying. I am of course sleep deprived and just feel like this is breaking me. I want to embrace this newborn stage but I can’t. Today I put him in his bassinet while he cried and I took a time out in the bathroom and I cried. I cried the ugliest and heaviest cry. I tugged at my hair, too. I am frustration and I thought I was doing great. I made it to 6 weeks breastfeeding and with my first I only (barely) made it to 4. I thought I was doing so good. Eating healthy. I haven’t had take out. Cookies. Chips. Or any junk of any kind. I am not drinking any coffee although my mom just bought me a new coffee machine because I don’t want anything else to contribute to his discomfort. 

I want to throw the towel in. I know I’m not a bad mom. I put him down to cry when I need to walk away. I don’t want to hurt him. I feel bad for him. Basically if he is awake…he is miserable and I want to give up. ",2,1736900201.0,newborns,4,1.0,False

1i1kni3,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypotheticalsituation/comments/1i1kni3/you_get_free_air_travel_for_lifebut/,You get free air travel for life......BUT,"Conditions. You will always be seated next to a random clown. Some of you may stop reading right there. For those left, I'll give you the full scoop:

 He wont be the Tim Curry IT type of clown, or the slasher movie clown, he will be more like the typical Bozo/Circus/kids birthday party type.

 When you arrive at your seat, he will honk his clown nose and make you a balloon animal. It will be of your least favorite animal. That's his standard introduction.

He will mostly sit still, but at random points during the flight, he will be annoying AF. 

Things like pulling an impossibly long multi-colored clown hankerchief out of his pocket and blowing his nose obnoxiously, with the hankercief being all over the place. 

At one point he might squirt you with his flower lapel.

Maybe he'll bop you in the head with an inflatable mallet when you're not looking .

Maybe he will top off your soft drink/coffee/beer with seltzer water at some point if you let your guard down with it. TSA will magically be okay with his seltzer bottle. No one at TSA or customs will care about his ID situation either 

Maybe when your attention is diverted he'll scare you and then laugh like an annoying villian.

Pull a trick with his scarf and then confetti gets all over you.

And maybe other mildly annoying things. He will act at random times. Clowns probably some interesting things in their carryon bags. They can do a lot with that. It's their whole job, after all.

The number of times he does something, correlates to the number of whole hours of the flight, but there's a three incident minimum.

3:59 or less flight time: Hes gonna do 3 things, and not necessarily every hour on the hour. But 3 things are coming at some point.

A flight time of 5 hours and 31 minutes? He does 5 things. 

12 hour long haul across the Pacific? LOL. You're in for a dozen. And don't fall asleep. He'll pull out his sharpie and you're gonna look like the Pringles guy is wearing Steve Urkel glasses. Unless you already have facial hair. Then he'll have to improvise with his clown makeup. 

Yeah that's the worst hell ever do. But there are things that you're just gonna notice if you're awake.


You just have to be okay with this. You can do no more than express your annoyance. ""Damnit."" ""What the fuck."" Etc.

He will let you up to use the bathroom upon request. 

He will part company with you at your destination. After the final incident, whenever that happens, he completely ignores you for the rest of the flight (save for said bathroom request) and you'll part company in the terminal.

But if you have a connecting flight take the time to gather your wits. Get a bite to eat, change your shirt and wash your face if needed. Because you'll see him again soon.

Technical stuff: You and only you can fly on the free ticket. You cannot use it for anyone else. 

You can book any seat free but you must book a seat that leaves at least one seat next to you open. That will be instantly booked by the clown, and flight changes won't fool him. He will rebook accordingly. That means the seats cannot have any dividers between them, such as what you might find in United Polaris, and the seat cannot be across the aisle. You so can't book a seat in a row that only has single seats.

No, the flight attendant will not let you switch seats, and yes, they're all gonna know if someone besides yourself presents the ticket. You're flying on the clown ticket. They know. 

If you don't want to fly next to the clown, then you're gonna have to pay for it. But if you use your unlimited clown miles to fly free, to anywhere, with no blackout dates, no purchase neccessry, well, all miles systems have their pros and cons, do they not?

Do you do it?

There's no other leak, but the water pump seems to run continuously, and the water reservoir empties really quickly. I'm not sure if it's a failing solenoid, OPV, water pump, or a bigger issue.

While doing this, I noticed a Delta captain in uniform come in and sit down with his drink at a table near mine. Well, here I am filling out applications, might as well get some hiring news straight from the horse's mouth, so I go over and start talking to him. I ask if he knows if Delta is hiring and I tell him that I'm a regional airline pilot. He doesn't seem to hear that last bit, and tells me that if I study hard and apply myself that I, too, can be an airline pilot like him. Oooookay, he's a lil deaf, so I tell him that, no, I'm already a pilot, I fly for Air Wisconsin. He kinda gives me a blank look, like he's never heard of air wisk*yahn*sin, and then just says that yeah, if I'm willing to fly international that I'll be hired quickly because nobody else wants to do it because their girlfriends get jealous. This surprised me, not just because of the unbidden and weird advice for my love life but also that Delta was easy to get into. I said wow, I sure will sir! He goes on to mention that flying charter for the vikings was interesting but they are rude to the other passengers, which should have been another warning sign because an NFL team sure as shit doesn't fly with other passengers. I finally twig to something being wrong when he says ""flying international is interesting when they refuel you in flight.""

""...Delta refuels in flight?""

""Yeah, the military does it all the time...""

""I knew that, but you're saying that DELTA airlines refuels its international flights MIDAIR?""

""Oh yeah, they do for the long flights. Especially for countries that don't really get along with the U.S.""

At this point I'm taking a good look at his uniform. He has a pilot shirt, I recognize the brand, his epaulets seem kosher, he's wearing a lanyard with what looks like a Delta card in it, he's even got a little gold Delta pin in his tie. HOWEVER, I just now realize that his wings above his left pocket are THE PLASTIC WINGS YOU HAND OUT TO KIDS ON AN AIRPLANE. And then I notice things like 'wait a minute, I'm nowhere near the airport, why is this guy wearing his uniform?' and 'he's in uniform but where's his submarine commander hat and pea coat, its freezing out there'. And then I realize holy shit, this guy is LARPING AS AN AIRLINE PILOT IN HIS LOCAL COFFEE JOINT. We've got a case of stolen airline valor down at caribou and its not the airport caribous so there isn't a discount or anything, this guy is just doing his thing and I fell for it for like three whole minutes.",177,1736899733.0,flying,51,0.91,False

1i1khtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/1i1khtb/trigger_warning_description_of_miscarriage_tldr_i/,"Trigger Warning - description of miscarriage. Tl;dr I had my second miscarriage at 8+5 weeks in a foreign country. I bled for 5 weeks and 2 days. I became anemic and had other health issues come up from the stress put on my body. 
","I wanted to share my miscarriage story since I leaned heavily on this subreddit during my last miscarriage and wanted to share my story in case it could help anyone else. A little bit about me, Im over 35 with Factor V Leiden (heterozygous) but no other known risks to first trimester loss. In late 2023, I had my first miscarriage at 6 weeks 4 days. It was very heavy bleeding (more than a period) for about a day and a half and then the bleeding tapered to spotting. I think I spotted for about 3 weeks after the initial miscarriage event. 

For my second miscarriage, I was at 8 weeks, 5 days when I went in for my first ultrasound. I was very nervous but also really excited to have made it to that milestone. The tech did an abdominal and trans-vaginal ultrasound and the entire time was sighing, scratching her head, and generally acting like things were not good. I asked her if she saw anything and she abruptly told me she could not relay any information to me and I needed to talk with my doctor. She finished what felt like a never-ending ultrasound and told me I needed to wait in the waiting room. About 15 minutes later she told me I could leave. From the readings of the ultrasound, it seemed it was either an MMC or ectopic pregnancy as all the tech could find was the gestational sac. My doctor wanted me to come back in a week to do a recheck ultrasound however I was unable to do this since we had a huge out of country trip planned that could not be canceled. My doctor told me I would be fine but might miscarry naturally while away and if I did I would need to seek medical attention if I was bleeding heavily (more than 2 pads an hour), had intense pain, or began vomiting. 

We left on our trip and I waited for the inevitable. It was a 2 week trip and by the end of the first week I was starting to spot a little. Since I already had one miscarriage in 2023, I was relieved to see the spotting, thinking that the miscarriage would happen soon and it would be over with. By my 10 week mark, I started to bleed a little heavier. I was passing a few clots but nothing too intense. By the next morning I woke to pain I can only describe as contractions. It was intense and very uncomfortable so I took Advil and put on a thin-regular absorbency pad. The Advil seemed to alleviate most of the pain. We went out to get coffee before a full day of traveling to the next city on our itinerary. At the coffee shop I felt as if I had wet my pants. I was wearing dark pants thankfully and when I felt where it was wet, my hand came back red. We rushed as fast as we could back to our AirBNB where I sat on the toilet for over an hour passing large clots and lots and lots of blood. I had brought thinner pads with me on the trip so we ended up running out to get larger overnight pads. With the larger overnight pads I was able to go over an hour before I’d soak through it which made our travel from one city to the next a little easier. I still was passing clots for most of the day and bleeding heavily especially when I used the toilet. After about 7-8 hours the worst of the bleeding was done.  
  
For the next week I used the heavy overnight pads and bled like a very heavy period. When we were back home, I went for an ultrasound where they noted that no pregnancy was detected but there was still a thicker endometrial wall. The doctor did not think we needed any other interventions and sent me home. I was to come back every week to test my HCG and make sure it was dropping. I bled a pretty consistent medium flow for another week. At this point I had been bleeding for 3 weeks. 

At the beginning of the fourth week of bleeding, I had a resurgence of the heavy bleeding and clot passing, almost like a round two of the miscarriage. I called my doctor to ask if that was normal and the nurse assured me that irregular bleeding was common and I could bleed for up to 6 weeks. She said as long as I wasn’t soaking through pads or in immense pain I was okay. I also was due to get my annual bloodwork done via my GP so I went in for that. They found I was anemic which made sense for how much bleeding I had endured plus how I was feeling. I had begun feeling light headed, tired, and had a little brain fog in the fourth week due to the anemia. I also began to develop a rash around my nose and mouth that turned out to be perioral dermatitis. This was thought to have been brought on by stress and hormonal changes.  
  
Toward the end of the fourth week of bleeding, I woke up and was still passing large amounts of blood and clots when I used the toilet and I just did not feel right. I decided to go to the emergency room and make sure there wasn’t any tissue left over from the pregnancy. The emergency room doctor did another basic blood panel to test my anemia levels, an HCG test, and an abdominal and trans-vaginal ultrasound. Everything came back mostly normal and no pregnancy was found. The doctor in the ER told me that most likely this was my period since the bleeding for the miscarriage had gotten a little lighter the week prior to the resurgence of bleeding and it would be about the right amount of time for my next period to start. I went home somewhat reassured and over the weekend the bleeding tapered to a very low flow, almost spotting.  
  
I had a work trip scheduled during the fifth week of bleeding and I went considering I knew it was just my period and was barely bleeding at that point. When I arrived at the hotel, I felt something soak my pants and when I went to the bathroom in my room I realized I had bled through my underwear and pants yet again. I had a mini breakdown and panic cried in the bathroom. I came prepared to that trip with a whole assortment of pads and my menstrual cup so I put the heavy overnight pad on and went about my evening. By the next day I had no other bleeding and assumed that final spurt was from the pressure change induced by the flight. Bleeding finally stopped at 5 weeks 2 days.  
  
About a week later, I started to spot again. According to my cycle tracker, if my period really did start that 4th week of bleeding, I would be ovulating. The best assumption I can come up with is that the spotting was left over blood coming out with the increased mucus production for ovulation. The spotting was very dark brown as if it was old. My final HCG test came back as <3mIU/ml which is considered non-pregnant. 

I wanted to share this since most women opt to get a D&C and I do not see a ton of natural miscarriage stories. I wish I had been able to get a D&C especially after this horrific experience. Being away from home and miscarrying on top of bleeding for weeks has taken an emotional and physical toll on my body. Im grateful to my husband and his family for helping me through the miscarriage while we were away and being very supportive when we got home. I wanted to share that on top of this subreddit, listening to episodes from this podcast helped me tremendously (Life After Miscarriage - [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/life-after-miscarriage/id1445592983](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/life-after-miscarriage/id1445592983)). Hearing everyone else’s miscarriage stories really helped me to heal and not feel so alone in something that is very isolating. 

Since this last miscarriage, we have had some preliminary bloodwork done along with karyotyping to rule out any issues and will be meeting with a perinatologist for a pre-conception appointment soon. Thank you all for sharing your stories and helping put my mind at ease while I was away from home and very scared. I wish I could hug every single one of you. ",1,1736899557.0,Miscarriage,0,1.0,False

You know, *servire* always throws my students for a loop. I remember this one time, during a lesson, a student exclaimed, ""I need a coffee!"" in English. I chuckled and thought, ""Ah, if only it were that simple in Italian!"" 

In Italian, *servire* is like a puzzle piece that doesn't fit where you'd expect. It means ""to need,"" but it flips the script. The thing you need becomes the **subject**, and you become the **indirect object**. It's like the universe revolves around the flour you need for pizza, not you!

Here's a quick peek into its quirky world:

- **Indirect pronouns** make the magic happen: *mi, ti, gli, ci, vi*.
- Need a euro? It's *Mi serve un euro* – literally, ""An euro is needed to me.""
- Want to express purpose? Use *servire a* or *servire per*. Scissors *servono a* cut, or *serve per* cutting.

And if you're at a restaurant, *servire* becomes more straightforward, like the waiter *serves* the meat.

So, next time you're in Italy and need a gelato, remember, it's all about what the gelato needs!

I’m continuously the one to approach him and be like ok let’s work this out now… one time I didn’t initiate post argument convo and he was silent for like 4 days!!! And let me say, this is small things he’s mad about. Like right this moment for example: this morning we both woke up at 6:15, he sat on the toilet for 20 min while I got dressed and did my hair and makeup. After that he got dressed for work, he started making the coffee and I started making our breakfast and packing his lunch. He sat on the couch waiting for the breakfast and once I was done cooking it we ate together at the table. He left for work and I left shortly after at 7:09. When I got to work I text him and mentioned that maybe we need to get up earlier since it was a little rushed. And he had the audacity to tell me “I was ready a long time ago, you took 40 min to get ready” ummm what??? No appreciation no compromise no nothing. I told him I want to feel valued and appreciated for cooking for him while also working full time and he never replied and has not spoke to me since. 

Why does he go freaking silent like this??? It drives me crazy since I like to solve the issue asap. Mind you, I cook dinner every evening, make breakfast every morning, pack his lunch every morning…. And I can’t get a thank you or or kind words or anything at all???

This happened to me last week and is nonfiction. Not a creative writing project, not an embellishment, this is what went on and made this guy my IRL cryptid.

I am a 19 year old male in Indiana, and had just finished a morning shift at work. I was at the gym, doing my workout, getting the shoulders of a Greek god, when a man points at me and gives me a big cheesey grin. I work at a coffee shop, and thus assumed that I had served him coffee a couple of times. I generally try to be friendly with all of the customers, and figured that maybe I had been friendly a couple of times, and had made a bigger impact on my life than I had made on his. I gave him a ""howdy!"" as is the Midwestern Staple, and continued my workout.

  
Twenty minutes later I see the guy, and he does the exact same thing. Big grin, points at me. He then approaches. I ask, ""How are you doing?"" 

His first line to me? ""I like to mess with kids.""

Terrible one right out of the gate, but it is a direct quote.

He then went on to tell me that he has four boys my age, and so he likes to have a little fun when he sees a guy in their lower 20s. Makes sense from a goofy dad perspective, I guess.

We exchange pleasentries, and I tell him that I am studying video and sound production at a local university.

This man, whose name is John, asks me if he can give me some advice, ""man to man,"" he says.

John tells me to broaden my horizons, and asks if I've ever considered doing video work for the FBI. He launches into a fifteen minute pitch, and I'm gonna be honest he gave some pretty good points. 

He wrapped it up, after intersplicing some bits about his sons working for different law enforcement or military agencies, and said ""Now I'm not a recruiter, but just keep your options open. It never hurts to broaden your horizons.""

And that was it. I found an angel or cryptid or kindred spirit that gave me man to man advice in a random gym in Indiana. I wouldn't be surprised if I never see the man again. ",5,1736899131.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I feel like i'm stuck at my current job and don't want to work here anymore, but I have no choice. I'm looking for real advice if anyone can help me out. I desperately need out ASAP. Thank you in advance.

[https://news.maryland.gov/mda/press-release/2025/01/14/preliminary-testing-confirms-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-in-queen-annes-county/](https://news.maryland.gov/mda/press-release/2025/01/14/preliminary-testing-confirms-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-in-queen-annes-county/) \>>

The **Maryland Department of Agriculture** has announced a second case in Maryland of highly pathogenic **H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI)** of a commercial operation in **Queen Anne’s County** following routine sampling of a broiler farm.  This new detection of HPAI comes four days after a presumptive positive was made at a **Caroline County** commercial poultry farm.  There are now four commercial operations in the Delmarva region confirmed to have HPAI, including two **Kent County, DE** premises.  

State officials have quarantined all affected premises, and birds on the properties are being or have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system.

Confirmation by the **U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory** is pending with final results anticipated in the coming days.   

Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among birds through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. This virus affects poultry, like chickens, ducks, and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and raptors.

According to the **Maryland Department of Health**, the risk of transmission between birds and the general public is low. Those who work directly with poultry or dairy farms may be more at risk and should follow key biosecurity practices. 

The Maryland Department of Agriculture continues to urge growers and backyard flock owners to enhance biosecurity practices and become familiar with what to do if HPAI is suspected in a flock. The **U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention** share more [guidance here.](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/prevention/worker-protection-ppe.html)

* Look for signs of illness. Know the [warning signs](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/outbreak-illness) of infectious bird diseases.
* Report suspected sick birds:

* To report a possible case of HPAI call the Maryland Department of Agriculture at 410-841-5810.  
* Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to [MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov](mailto:MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov).

Key biosecurity practices:  

* Clean and disinfect transportation. Don’t walk through or drive trucks, tractors, or equipment in areas where waterfowl or other wildlife feces may be. If you can’t avoid this, clean your shoes, vehicle, and equipment thoroughly to prevent bringing disease agents back to your flock.  This is especially important when visiting with farmers or those who hunt wild fowl such as when gathering at a local coffee shop, restaurant, or gas station.  
* Remove loose feed. Don’t give wild birds, rodents, and insects a free lunch. Remove spilled or uneaten feed right away, and make sure feed storage units are secure and free of holes. Wild birds can carry HPAI.
* Keep visitors to a minimum. Only allow those people who take care of your poultry to come in contact with your birds,  including family and friends. Make sure everyone who has contact with your flock follows biosecurity principles.
* Wash your hands before and after coming in contact with live poultry.  Wash with soap and water. If using a hand sanitizer, first remove manure, feathers, and other materials from your hands because disinfectants will not penetrate organic matter or caked-on dirt.
* Provide disposable boot covers (preferred) and/or disinfectant footbaths for anyone having contact with your flock. If using a footbath, be sure to remove all droppings, mud or debris from boots and shoes using a long-handled scrub brush BEFORE stepping into the disinfectant footbath, and always keep it clean. 
* Change clothes before entering poultry areas and before exiting the property.  Visitors should wear protective outer garments or disposable coveralls, boots, and headgear when handling birds, and shower and/or change clothes when leaving the facility.  
* Clean and disinfect tools or equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility. Before allowing vehicles, trucks, tractors, or tools and equipment—including egg flats and cases that have come in contact with birds or their droppings—to exit the property, make sure they are cleaned and disinfected to prevent contaminated equipment from transporting disease. Do not move or reuse items that cannot be cleaned and disinfected—such as cardboard egg flats.

Slight disclaimer, I have a history of being  physically abused by my dad. I was in foster care for part of my teens due to that. So some of what I’m describing may be due to my past experiences.
To explain my relationship is complicated. She’s my girl, but not my girlfriend. It’s a situation ship I suppose. We’ve been together for 5 years and we live together. She doesn’t work (she drives for Uber eats occasionally but not often) so primarily I pay the bills. And tbh with everyone I’m her Sub. We don’t have sex in the traditional way. Which is partially why I’m okay with paying for the bills. Plus I have a relatively great job with decent pay. So we’re not struggling.

I do everything I can to please this woman. I clean the house, I do the dishes, take the trash out. I give her massages, I literally tell her all the time how much I love and adore her. But we’ve always argued ALOT. And it’s only been the last year, but lately she’s been getting more and more physical. It started with her pushing me. Then it turned into her punching my arms. Eventually it escalated to today. She slapped me twice, and started hitting me over and over, and due to past events, I ended up curled on the floor crying begging her to stop, she started hitting the back of my head.
 
The rational thought would be that I am doing something to upset her that I’m not being honest about with you guys. But I swear, I don’t cheat, I’m loyal, fuck I don’t even have money to cheat or do anything outside of her. I legit pay everything for her (again I’m fine with that with being her sub. We do have an intimate more boyfriend girlfriend relationship as well but at its core, I’m always in a submissive role with her.) Her reasoning for why she was so mad is that I wouldn’t shut up. I work overnights. I had just woken up and was making my coffee, and I asked her what the stuff on the counter was, ina ziplock bag, looked like little crystals in a baggie. I did assume it could be drugs as she likes to party with her friends occasionally. Not excusing her actions, but I genuinely asked out of concern. And that I wouldn’t shut up when she said she didn’t want to tell me is what set her off.

She took my keys and told me she wants me out by this weekend. But again, I just paid her rent last week, so I’ll be homeless in my car for at least a few weeks if she doesn’t change her mind. And idk if I can take the hitting. Not because it hurts, I have a high pain tolerance, but it hurts that someone I’m in love with could actually treat me this way. The entire time I kept telling her I didn’t do anything to her for her to act like this. And usually she apologizes for hitting me a day or two later. But the way she was today was different. 

I called out from work and I’m staying in my car tonight. I can’t go into work with how I am. And I can’t go home. Idk what to do. I do love this woman and I know the obvious answer is “Leave her!” But that’s just it, she truly does make me happy and I truly do love her. I don’t know what to do.

In his office, Mickey was perplexed. He searched the Valley News on his old laptop. There was no mention of the attack at the sheriff’s department. That should have been a huge story on the front page. Hell, it should have been national news, or at least statewide, but the only thing in the paper were the headlines:

BLIZZARD HINDERS VOTE

ALLGOOD EXPECTED TO SWEEP

COMSTOCK A SHOO-IN FOR LAKE COUNTY SHERIFF

The night before lingered in his head. Not just the horror of the murders—he wasn’t sure how to tackle that one yet—but he couldn’t stop thinking about the concert. Even after he’d heard that first note, Francis’s music had echoed within him. The memory of the music, the impossible rainstorm inside the jail, and what he’d seen, a vision now faded like a dream, sent shivers down his spine.

When he got home from the police station, he searched the internet to see if someone had uploaded anything. Oddly, there was nothing on the video tubes or socials. It took some hunting, but at last, on a poorly coded, back-web indie forum that looked like the entrance to an old barn, a user by the name of Firefan79 posted: _Builds A Fire Brings the Rain (raw)_. It was Firefan79’s first and only post, and their profile card revealed a registration time of yesterday.

There was one comment by an anonymous user: _Check your file, bruh. Don’t hear shit_.

During the live performance, he had not, for some strange reason, been able to hear the first song—just like when he and Alan had met the hippie in the sandwich shop’s parking lot—then something changed. Francis had drawn him in, spoke to him, taught him _how_ to hear, and there it was, the boy’s sweet, soft voice and the pluck of his guitar.

Resisting the urge to listen to the entire concert again, he skipped to the last few seconds. Firefan79 had left a period of silence without music in the recording, but it included muffled voices, laughter, the sound of rain, distant thunder, and the first scream that marked Comstock’s arrival. A girl’s voice said, “Let’s go—” and the recording ended.

The presence of Foxy standing next to his table snapped him out of his trance. “You’re listening to Builds A Fire,” she said.

“Yeah—hey, yeah! You know him?”

She nodded, an expression on her face he couldn’t quite place. “The Maji. That’s from last night.”

“At the sheriff’s office. There was a—”

“Concert,” she finished his sentence. “I know. I was there.”

“Wait, you were there? I didn’t see you,” he said.

“I know.” She bit her lower lip in concentration. Her expression held words that needed to be spoken. There was something about her now, something he’d not seen in all the years he had crushed on her, as if she were taking off a mask to reveal a depth, a mystery.

She leaned close to him to look at his computer screen. He could feel the warmth from her face and chest and smell her perfume, lilacs and honey.

“I’m surprised it made it online so fast,” she said.

“Foxy, what do you know about Builds A Fire?”

“I’ve been waiting a long time for that concert. He’s the Maji. His music… Wait, I have some of his songs on my phone.” She retreated behind the counter, and after a moment, the sound of guitar strings replaced the Christmas jingles on the restaurant’s speakers. “This song is called ‘Steal the Fire.’ It came out about a year ago. It’s about finding your power.”

Just as it had the night before, he felt the music reaching out to him, touching him, drawing him down deep into his mind.

She sat across from him and rested her chin in her hands.

He lost track of time and urgency, like he was a kid again, daydreaming in school. At some point, Francis began to sing—or had he always been singing? Mickey wasn’t sure. The words were gentle at first, narrating a story of a journey. The way the boy controlled his voice was mesmerizing, and the voice controlled Mickey. He tingled with excitement, an unexplored energy suggesting infinite iterations. In the next stanza, the hero of the ballad came into focus—a young girl in a frozen land. She was a fierce fighter with a sword in a vast forest where lurked a dark danger.

Mickey trembled intensely with the intuition that he was on the verge of understanding a point of monumental importance. He needed to know this wisdom, to capture it, possess it, yet it flitted like a shadow at the boundary of his comprehension… of his courage.

He had been watching her gaze out the window into the falling snow that hid the lake beyond its dense curtain. Her expressions fluctuated as the music played. He thought he could read them; from joy to longing, to a single tear that formed at the corner of her eye and slipped down her cheek. He reached out and brushed it away with his thumb. She was warm and soft. She smiled at him. The song faded.

“Alright?” he asked.

“Yeah, I guess I hear a lot of sadness in this one. It makes me think of my mom. I wish she could have heard the music.”

“I’m sorry. Did you lose her?”

The beautiful waitress nodded, wiped her eyes, and said, “No makeup to smear today.”

“You’re stunning,” he said.

She blushed. “You would say that, Mickey Verona.”

“Maji?” he said the word he’d heard her use.

Foxy opened her mouth to speak but stopped.

“It’s okay,” he said. “I need to know.”

“I don’t know anything, really. Not much.”

In his mind, he saw the clouds rolling across the ceiling. It had rained inside the jail and drenched him. The water had run into his eyes, blurring the world. When he wiped it away, he had seen another world, briefly. He had known and understood, but then it had been ripped away by Comstock’s insanity, like a baby from a mother’s breast.

“This boy, this singer, is my client.”

“You represent the Maji?”

“Francis Builds A Fire. He got into some trouble. Remember I was in here with Dr. Smith a couple days ago?”

“Yeah, the tall guy, Dr. Handsome but Brooding.”

“Right, the tall, brooding guy. That was Francis’s shrink.”

“What’s he need a shrink for?”

Mickey told her of Francis’s arrest because he was suspected of doing something to John Taylor’s daughter. He told her about finding the poster that had predicted Francis would give a concert at the jail, about how so many people had come, and how he at first couldn’t hear the music, but then he could—the guitar and singing—how it had rained, and how he’d wept, how everyone had wept.

“Then Comstock showed up and crashed the party. He beat Francis down, busted the blue guitar. He got Alan, too. But I can’t believe I didn’t see you there.”

“Mickey,” Foxy reached across the table and took his hand in both of hers. “Call it my faith, but that boy, whatever happened, he wasn’t trying to hurt that girl. I know it like I know myself.”

“I don’t believe he did. There’s something else, Foxy, something terrible. Last night, there was an attack on the sheriff’s department. Ten people were horribly killed.”

She gasped and put her hand to her mouth.

“Comstock and an FBI agent paid a visit to my house this morning. He said Francis, Alan, and Deputy Wolf are missing. They’re suspects in the murders. Hell, the FBI’s watching my house as we speak. I gave them the slip to get here.”

Foxy squeezed his hand hard. “It was the hunters. That was a big enchantment. They tracked it to the jail for sure.”

“Hunters,” he said. “Francis used that word, and this morning, when Deputy McGreevy brought me the boy’s guitar, he said that hunters had come for him. That he killed them… I almost thought he was having an episode.”

“You’re saying you have the Maji’s guitar?”

“That’s right. It’s sitting on my sofa, all smashed to pieces.”

He relayed McGreevy’s visit in the predawn hours. He’d been at his table, hoping for more information to come across the scanners, but there were only the garbled messages of encrypted transmissions. The knock had come at the back door. The storm was raging so hard that when he opened it, the short deputy blew in with the snow and shoved the guitar into Mickey’s arms. “The hunters came for me. I killed them. I burned their bodies just like she told me to,” McGreevy exclaimed. Mickey could tell he was manic; his eyes were wide, and his breath was coming in gasps. “You need to get this to Francis. Tell him the next concert is in Billings. He needs to get to Billings. You didn’t see me. Promise me, Mickey, you didn’t see me.” And with that promise, he was gone back out into the stormy night.

“The hunters are real, Mickey.”

“I have no reason to disbelieve it,” he said. “I sure as hell find it more likely than Dr. Brooding ever lifting a finger. Alan can hardly blow his own nose without having an existential crisis.” He grunted at his own wit. “What is it, girl?”

The waitress’s face had gone pale.

“Last night after the concert, I felt the hunters prowling around. I thought they were after me. For what I did.”

“After you? You mean they came here?”

“I don’t know. I didn’t look out the window. I came home, locked the door, and pulled the blankets over my head, like when I was a little girl. I said the words my mom taught me to—” She pursed her lips then sipped her coffee. “It must sound crazy.”

“You can tell me. I need to know. It’s all different now.”

“Oh, Mickey,” her voice trembled. “They’ve been after me for so long.”

“Foxy, if anybody fucking touches you, I will rip their goddamn nuts off!” The idea of Foxy being a victim of what transpired at the jail made his heart pound in his chest. “What did you do that made you think someone was after you?”

She sat upright. “I don’t think you’ll understand.”

“Try me.”

She took a gander around the restaurant. It was still empty.

“Do you believe in magic, Mickey, real magic?” There was no hint of amusement on her face.

“Like hocus pocus?”

“I guess so. Why not? Why not like that?”

“Lawyers are pretty logical types, apart from the odd superstition here and there.”

“What superstition do you have?”

“Who? Me?”

“Yeah, you.” She poked a finger in his face and, for a glorious instant, touched the cleft of his chubby chin.

“It’s kind of embarrassing.”

“Darn it, just tell me. I won’t laugh. Then I’ll tell you _my_ secret.”

“You have a secret?” To learn anything from Foxy’s heart chamber made his throat dry. He had to sip some coffee.

“Sure, I do, silly, real _interesting_ secrets.” She bit her lip, and Mickey spilled the beans.

“So, when I go to court, I only wear a special pair of underwear. They were my dad’s. He wore them the day he passed the bar exam.”

Foxy let out a giggle. “Are you serious?”

“Hey, _you_ asked _me_. But it’s a superstition. I don’t actually think it’s magic.”

“Sure, that’s magic, and a bit perverse.” She grinned. “That’s what I’m talking about. You do something that affects something else. The thing you do, the way you think, has some bearing on what happens when you’re in court.”

“It’s just psychological.”

“But you feel better when you’re wearing your magical lawyer-daddy dungees. It changes you, even just in your head.”

“Yeah. Court can really fuck you up, but I got my magic underwear, so come at me.” Mickey did a little matador dance with his arms.

“Christ, Mickey, you’re too much! Are you wearing them now?”

“Nah, I’m free balling. No court today.”

“Ya know, you’re pretty funny for a guy being watched by the FBI.”

She retrieved a pot from the coffee island and filled his cup.

“And what about the concert last night? Was that magic? I think rain inside a building is pretty magical.”

“It was crazy,” he said. “The clouds, right where I could touch them. I even saw lightning.”

“And the music?”

“I’ve never heard anything like it. I could listen to it forever. I could lose myself in it.”

“But you said at first you couldn’t hear it.”

“That’s right. I couldn’t, not the first song. It was totally silent. I could see he was singing. I just couldn’t hear it.”

“But then you did. Now you can hear that song you didn’t hear before.”

“Yeah, Francis, he did something. He did…” Mickey began and then stopped, as if saying it to another person would make him a true believer.

“Magic,” Foxy finished for him.

“You think he really did magic, like real hocus pocus? Real magic?”

“The fact that magic is _not_ real has never crossed my mind,” Foxy said. “To me, it’s always been real. I’ve always been able to hear his music, and I’ve always known it was special.”

“That’s a crazy scenario. I don’t know if I can accept it.”

“What about your psychologist friend?”

“Alan?” There was something about Alan he couldn’t understand. He was completely devoted to Francis. He wanted to fight all the kid’s battles and lash out at the forces rallied against him. But at the same time, he seemed to fear the boy. “Yeah, Alan drank the Kool-Aid. That thing for him last night was a baptism, not just—”

“Mickey, listen to yourself. You were _there_. And now you’re saying it wasn’t real.”

“I’m saying that my client, his shrink, and the cop who arrested him have fled, accused of murdering six law enforcement officers _and_ others. I can’t afford to play fucking Harry Potter. I have motions to file. The fucking FBI is on my doorstep.”

Foxy placed a hand on his arm. “Come here.”

She led him through the tables to the door of the ladies’ restroom. He pulled back slightly at the taboo of crossing that threshold.

“It’s okay.”

“You gonna show me your secret?”

“I am. I trust you.”

The bathroom had the flowery smell of just having been cleaned.

“Look at yourself.” She pointed into the mirror. “What do you see?”

He had never been a fan of his own reflection, yet he forced himself to look. A short, middle-aged man who was bald on top with messy black hair around the sides. He had gained some weight in the last year—shit, he needed to get back into the gym. The dark circles under his eyes that never seemed to go away were darker today.

“What do I see?”

“Yes. Be honest.”

“I see a not very handsome man,” he said.

“I’ve always thought you were handsome.” She quickly pecked him on the lips. His heart jumped at the stolen kiss. She squeezed his arm harder. “Look again.”

As he looked, she traced his cheek with her finger. His double chin vanished. She ran her thumb under his eyes, and the dark circles faded. She caressed his bald head, and healthy locks of full, thick hair, like he had in high school, spilled between her fingers. She pressed her palm on his stomach, and his gut melted away. Foxy lifted his shirt, and he saw the fine definition of a six-pack.

“You look quite handsome to me, Mickey Verona,” she whispered like nectar in his ear.

He felt her weight slump against him, and he caught her before she could fall.

“Foxy, are you okay?”

Her eyes were closed. “Yeah, just a little bit dizzy,” she said. “I’ve always wanted to try that on someone else.”

The veritable Adonis in the mirror faded. Once again, there was the old Mickey Verona, bald, chubby, with dark circles and all.

“That was incredible!” he said.

“Thank you, but like I said, not very useful.”

“How…”

“Call it magic, I guess. I’ve always been able to do it, but…”She went back into the restaurant and looked around—empty. “But before last night, the hunters could have found me. That’s why I went to that concert. The Maji’s music helps people like me.”

“What do you mean, people like you? You’re perfect.”

“I mean… there are others. We cross each other’s paths from time to time. It’s rare, but it happens. We all know to keep it a secret, keep to ourselves. It’s the only way to survive. Don’t do enchantments. Enchantments bring the hunters.”

“Those people at the concert. They were… like you?”

She nodded, “Most of them anyway. Running scared. They needed to hear the Maji’s music. And, if they survived the night, the hunters can’t find them now. That’s why.”

“I need to find Alan and Francis. He needs that guitar.”

“I’m going to help you,” she declared.

“No, it’s too dangerous,” he said boldly.

“I’m tired of hiding,” she nearly cried. “You can’t understand.”

The waitress was easily six inches taller than him, but he couldn’t help himself. Ever so slowly, ever so timidly, he leaned forward, stood a little on his toes, and kissed her. And she kissed him back. The passion that had incubated as a spark for a little more than five years suddenly burst into flame. When at last their lips parted and their tongues ceased to dance, Mickey and Foxy were both breathless.

“Was that okay?” Mickey asked. “I’m not as handsome as that man in the mirror.”

“Shut up, Mickey Verona.” She pressed her lips against his one more time.",1,1736898665.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

occasionally i go to work with him when i have a spare day but sometimes i just don't feel like it. today was one of those days. i woke up at 7 and went for an hour and a half to get breakfast and a coffee and recalibrate. i go back to school in a couple of weeks and he asked if i'd like to go with him to the city. i love spending time with him and i do regularly because one: he drives me to school and just around because i cant drive yet and two: i've lived with him since i was born. 

i'm aware he's getting older and when he asks me things like this i know its precious one on one time with him that at some point, i won't have. my grandma makes me feel bad about it but i've spent the past week with friends and i just feel burnt out from people and wanted a break where i could relax at home.

I found the doctor through Reddit, the list of docs who are friendly to sterilization. She was awesome and I cannot recommend her enough. If anyone in SE Wisconsin is looking for an obgyn message me and I'll give you her name. 

I got to the hospital at 5:45 this morning for a 7:30 surgery. Got checked in and taken back. Pregnancy tested and IV started you know the drill. The anesthesiaologist came in the talk to me and the nurses did their vitals. I was so thirsty at this point and the IV was irritating. That was honestly the worst part about the whole experience I'd say, that annoying IV. 

At about 715 the nurse came back to let us know that doc was running about an hour behind due to another surgery. I closed my eyes and had a little snooze and before I knew it the doc was there. They wheeled me back into the operating room and got me hooked up to the heart monitors and such. They told me when they pushed the IV meds to make me sleep and I was out within probably 15 seconds. While out they did intubate me and catheterized me, which is standard. The surgery took about 40 mins and I had no complications. 

I came to in the surgical recovery area. I did have some coughing from the intubation which they warned me would probably happen because I'm a smoker. Once I got a few good coughs out that stopped. I had no pain, it felt like I had mild period cramps. Of course I was drugged up pretty good at that point. I was fully awake and back into my regular room within about 20 mins. 

Once in the regular recovery room, they did my vitals again. They asked me my pain level (maybe a 2?). They had me eat some crackers and juice. Since I wasn't in pain, my vitals were good and I was fully awake they took out the IV and went over discharge info. While doing that my partner pulled up the car and they walked me out. I was back home and chilling by 11:15 with an iced coffee as a treat. 

I had never been put under before except for sedation for my wisdom teeth so I had worries I would still be able to feel or be aware under general. Not the case! I mean they tell you it absolutely won't happen but my worry was that I'd be the rare case. I also worried the pain after would be bad but it's not at all, so far. The doc send me home with instructions to take Tylenol every 6hrs for the first few days but she also sent a script for oxycodone. I doubt I'll need those. I anticipate I'll be more sore tomorrow. Anyways so that's my experience. Easy peasy! ",7,1736898468.0,sterilization,1,1.0,False

It was a productive day - Cleaned up my room, closet, done with interview prep questions and job applications. A good Sankrati indeed.

When I was in the kitchen this morning, trying to heat up my coffee with a 2 min timer, it hit me, I am not able to  stand still for 2 min and infact how long those 2 min were. There are times when I complain of the fact that I don't have enough time, to do things, but the actual problem is I don't know how to manage my time and I know how to find excuses well.

Being on the phone watching shorts or being on reddit feels so much easier than enduring 5 min of meditation and time and again I choose my phone. Infact I rarely leave my phone alone, I panic when it's on low charging and I can't find a charger or when I think I lost it because it's not in front of my eyes for a min. It's scary how much control I let it have.

I’m a 56-year-old guy from Central Florida—6'2"", 280 lbs, and embracing the dad bod life. Happily married for 30 years and in a supportive, polyamorous relationship, I’m looking for a like-minded woman to share laughter, adventure, and maybe a little mischief along the way.

I’m a mix of outdoor enthusiast and tabletop daydreamer. On any given day, you might find me hiking a new trail, setting up camp under the stars, or taking a random turn down an unfamiliar road just to see where it leads (spoiler alert: sometimes it’s amazing, sometimes it’s a dead end, but the fun is in the journey).

When I’m indoors, I love diving into the world of table-top RPGs, playing card games, or enjoying the occasional board game. There’s something special about rolling dice and telling a great story, whether it’s outsmarting a dragon or surviving a hilariously bad decision. Game nights with good company are always a win in my book—though fair warning, I’m terrible at poker faces and great at laughing at myself.

I’m looking for a woman who shares a sense of humor, a love for exploring, and an openness to trying new things. Whether it’s swapping stories over coffee, playing cards late into the night, or wandering trails to nowhere in particular, I’d love to connect with someone who values curiosity, connection, and a dash of spontaneity. Bonus points if you can recommend a great burger joint or have a secret hiking spot to share!

Honesty is a big deal to me—everyone involved knows everything, no drama, no games (unless they come with dice). I believe in open communication and building relationships that feel authentic and fun. If you’ve got a favorite RPG tale, a hilarious road trip memory, or just want to pitch me the ultimate snack combination for a hike, I’m all ears!

Let’s chat, laugh, and see where this road might lead. Life’s an adventure—why not take it together?",1,1736898395.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

Experience: 3 1/2 year of restaurant experience with 3 years of actual serving at 2 different corporate restaurants.

Location: Bay Area, CA(Napa, Vallejo, Oakland, SF, Berkeley, Walnut Creek, etc)

I did get 3 offers, but one was temporary, other was a food runner position, and the other one I just figured out was too far for me. I show up on time, dress business casual, make sure I make eye contact, I feel like I answer their questions in a good manner. Which is the bare minimum, i'm aware. I just...tired.

She takes dancing classes, and takes part in dance clubs every 3 weeks or so where she parties with her friends from there. Now of course that wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that the person she goes most with is a guy who took her on a date a few months before we started talking. She always reassures me that he isn't a problem, and that she rejected him, but he is always very clearly flirting with her, and they're spending time together before dance classes sometimes.

But i let that pass, i don't want to be too controlling, and just forgot about it for a few months. 
Then yesterday, we were out for a coffee, and she's talking about the dance club that wast weekend, and she just so happened to drop the fact the she wen't up to his place, with another guy(that had a gf) and drank before going to the club itself.
So yeah. I didn't really have the guts neither yesterday or today to confront her that i don't really feel that this is right, mainly because i'm not really good at arguments.
How would you guys go about confronting her?

There was a Post-It note on my desk in Deirdre’s handwriting. Bless her. She must've had some inclination that I'd be making a mad dash back. Thankfully, the address she'd written down wasn't far. After downing some Excedrin and a glass of water, I was on my way. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U) 

If anyone was curious, *yes,* I was an anxious wreck during the drive. There was a lot weighing on my mind, one of those thoughts being the possibility of Wes getting himself killed. I didn't believe for a moment that Iolo would take my words to heart. He'd do what he wanted. I just had to have faith that the vampire knew what he had gotten himself into. 

On another note, a smarter person may have recognized that after having something as substantial as the second sight bestowed upon them, they should go home and try to figure out how to deal with such a huge change. Unfortunately, I had neither the time nor the patience to be smart. And in case I haven't made it clear enough, self-care is *not* my strong suit. 

I spotted Reyna's Monte Carlo in the driveway of the address on the Post-It. Silently, I hoped that I'd be walking in to good news. However, when Deirdre answered the door, her face told me *that* was out of the question. 

“Reyna's tried so many different mixtures,” She whispered grimly. “We have yet to find one that works.”

The one they were trying now contained rice coffee, as well as the leaves and bark of a plant called ‘fragrant manjack.’ The Hunger Grass victim was slumped over his kitchen table, sipping at the concoction while Reyna observed him with wide, worrying eyes. The farmhand was a big man, though given the sallow cast to his skin, his strength was starting to wane. 

Then I saw his shadow stretching along the ground. Gaunt. Skeletal. 

*What the hell?!*

“Anything?” Reyna asked the farmhand. 

“Could use some sugar.” He mumbled, his lukewarm joke falling flat with how fatigued he sounded. 

When he noticed me, I introduced myself to him as another Orion employee, hoping that my unease at his shadow's appearance wasn't too obvious. It didn't help that Deirdre was searching my face. Reyna also knew me well enough to recognize that something was wrong. 

The farmhand didn't seem to notice, understandably too preoccupied with his own dilemma. He kept sipping at the rice coffee, eyes and face blank. 

While Reyna tended to him, Deirdre ushered me back into the farmhand’s hallway. “What happened?”

Deirdre’s shadow. It was strange, too. It rippled as if it were underwater. The edges of it were fuzzy. What did that mean?

When she caught me staring at it, she understood instantly, “Dà shealladh. Who gave it to you?”

“It was the Hungry Man’s idea of a gift,” I explained quietly, forcing myself to tear my gaze away from her waving silhouette. “He told me to use it well.”

Deirdre’s lovely gray eyes were as gentle as her palm against my cheek, then she suddenly frowned. “You’re feverish.”

I didn’t doubt it. The room certainly felt far too warm. The chill of her palm was refreshing. 

“Good for me,” I said absent-mindedly, then feeling somewhat unhinged, informed her, “His shadow is all wrong. It’s all emaciated. I don’t think whateve you’re trying is working… or if anything is going to work, for that matter.”

“I know what sights you’re being haunted with all too well,” Deirdre replied with a sad smile. “So allow me to assure you that fate is not sealed in stone. We change it and shape it like dough.”

I then hurriedly informed her that Wes was keeping the mechanic busy. Buying us time to shape this farmhand’s fate, preferably into something more favorable than what was showing behind him on his dining room wall. When asked, I told her that Wes’ shadow had been normal before I left him. According to her, that was a good sign. If his silhouette had been missing a head, however, that would be another story.

I’ll admit that having the second sight scares me, even with Deirdre here to help me navigate it. It’s often been said that humans weren’t meant to be able to glimpse behind the veil; that’s why it’s there to begin with. An opaque boundary between the world of the atypical and ours. Certain things are best left unknown.

Another glimpse at the man’s silhouette confirmed that the tincture still wasn’t working. The remains of other unsuccessful treatments lined the counter. Goodness gracious. 

Thus came the discussion of how to proceed. Unfortunately, I did not have much to contribute, given my lack of knowledge on the matter (and fever-related fatigue). Mostly, I sat on the couch, waiting for one of them to give me instructions. 

“I do know of one ritual performed by the Druids, but, truthfully, it may be a bit far-fetched,” Deirdre had said in a hushed tone. “It was mainly used to treat infertility and poisoning.”

Reyna’s brow furrowed, “But mistletoe is poisonous.”

“With the way that the Druids prepared it, it was safe for human consumption in small doses.” Deirdre explained. “However, that preparation is arduous.”

Running a hand through her hair nervously, Reyna reasoned, “Broadly speaking, curses are a kind of spiritual poison, so… it could work. What’s the ritual.”

It is as follows: two white bulls are tied together at the horns beneath a patch of mistletoe growing on an oak tree. Someone clothed in all white must then climb the tree and cut the mistletoe off with a golden sickle. The mistletoe must then be caught in a white sheet and not be permitted to touch the ground under *any* circumstances. Afterwards, the two bulls are sacrificed. 

“That’s quite a shopping list.” I commented unsurely.

“As I said, it’s far-fetched,” Deirdre agreed. “I’m not even certain if there’s mistletoe in this area.”

“There is,” I informed them. Then, not wanting to throw Vic under the bus, I told a little white lie. “We spotted some on the night of the Mare incident.” 

Reyna nodded gravely, “Okay. That’s one thing accounted for. A golden sickle and two white bulls are a pretty tall order, especially on short notice, but a lot of these things are symbolic. Hypothetically, if we can recreate the symbolism correctly, it *could* still work.”

They went back and forth for a while, using their combined knowledge to find meaningful substitutions for each missing piece. 

From what I gathered, the bull in Druidic culture personified strength and potency, hence why they were so valuable in a ritual intended to treat infertility and poisoning. White is often attributed to cleanliness or purity, which is possibly the same reason why whoever cuts down the mistletoe will have to also be clad in it. Ordinarily, white bulls wouldn’t be too difficult to come across, but given recent events, cows are in short supply around here lately.

Similarly, rams represent strength and were utilized in fertility rituals. Since white rams are a lot less difficult to come across, and as far as we knew, haven't had their population decimated by cursed Grass, that was a strong possibility. Snakes were also brought up, since they’re associated with healing, but they agreed that the rams seemed to be more suitable. 

“There is a sheep farm out towards the highway,” Reyna supplied. “It’s the same one that let us use one of their lambs for Samhain, so hopefully they’ll be willing to help us out again.”

As for the sickle, gold, like other precious metals used by ancient Celts, is believed to have purification properties. That’s why it was so effective for fending off the Dullahan on Samhain. The metal appears to be more important than the tool itself; so as long as we used a tool made out of either gold, silver, or platinum, it should suffice. 

“So our silver knives should work?” I asked.

“If our logic is sound, then yes,” Reyna confirmed. 

Finally. Something I could help with. 

I rose from my seat, trying to pretend like my head wasn't swimming, “Since I have the truck, I can take care of the sacrifices. I imagine the bed should be able to hold two full-grown rams, but I guess we'll find out.”

Both of them looked worried. 

“Are you sure you're up for this, Nessa?” Reyna questioned, eyeballing me as if expecting me to keel over dead any second. 

Did I really look that bad?

“Admittedly, I'm not feeling the best, but I can still function.” I assured them. “Besides, I've done crazier things while feeling worse.”

Deirdre gave me a weird look, “That is not comforting in the slightest.”

Reyna did not help. “Like the time you snuck out of your bathroom window to make your girlfriend read a book to ruin Psycho Mantis’s life?”

“Yeah! Like that!”

Deirdre balked, “You snuck out of a *window* to get to me? With *pneumonia?*”

“Uh, yeah, Briar was kinda camped outside of my front door,” I said sheepishly. “Also, we should get moving.”

“I'll stay with the client,” Reyna offered. “See if I can keep him as calm and comfortable as possible. Maybe I'll try to get the vitamin D deficient king to answer his phone, when I have a chance.”

With our last ditch attempt to fix the Grass sickness plotted out, Deirdre and I were en route to the sheep farm. The Excedrin was starting to help with the headache, thankfully. Once again, Deirdre tried to convince me to go home and rest, but me being the ‘stubborn mule’ that I am, I refused, determined to see this out. This is ‘Murica, we ignore illness here. 

Everything was going alright, for the most part. I’d called ahead to the farm and they had a couple of rams that they could part with. Between Samhain and this experimental treatment, they’ve made some good money off of Orion. I’m just grateful that we have somewhere that’s actually willing to work with us. It can’t be easy.

The trouble came when we reached the crossroads. 

It was snowing pretty hard, thanks to the polar vortex. When I saw the writhing figures waiting for us by the stop sign, I slammed on the breaks, almost causing us to spin out. Normally, I know better than to do that on slushy roads while it’s below freezing, but if yinz could’ve seen what I did, you’d understand why I was shaking by the time the truck finally came to a stop.

For starters, we need to stop calling them ‘snow people;’ before I could *really* see them, some appeared to have humanoid figures. But now that the veil was lifted, I could see that some bore a shape more similar to fleshy coffins, which gives the impression of a head and shoulders as the snow rushes past. A round, wide, pink mouth was in their centers, pulsating and ravenous as the black ‘lips,’ for lack of a better term, flexed and unflexed in time with my frantic heartbeat. 

The others were tangles of wriggling, tubal appendages that reminded me far too much of a bundle of black, meaty worms. What appeared to be lobster claws could occasionally be glimpsed in those strange snow figures. Even though I can’t confirm it, I’m fairly confident that one of these delightful worm balls was responsible for messing up the truck that one time.

In the past, snow figures were just a nuisance. A dangerous nuisance, granted, but pests nonetheless. Now that I could see them, I am ashamed to admit I was somewhat petrified, for a moment. Even though the snow figures didn’t have eyes, from what I could see, I knew that they were waiting for the truck to get closer. 

“They’re exactly the same as they’ve always been,” Deirdre soothed me, her fingertips stroking the back of my hand comfortingly. “You can beat them with fire, same as before.”

I gave myself a small shake in an attempt to snap myself out of it. Deirdre was right. They hadn’t changed. They were still just snow figures. Heat drives them off. And if I could get the truck through the intersection quickly enough, I wouldn’t have to worry about confronting them. 

After a swallow and a deep breath, I started off accelerating slowly, not wanting to skid again. The last thing we needed was an accident. Time was of the essence. We’d already wasted enough. Once the truck felt as if it had traction, I pushed it further.

Even though seeing the snow figures’ true forms was a shock to my system, it did make avoiding them easier than ever. As the truck soared through the crossroads, I noted that the coffin-shaped ones couldn’t move around very well. The worm balls, on the other hand, move fairly quickly, though they take unsteady, loping strides. Their claws snapped at the truck. I grit my teeth as one managed to nick the passenger side mirror, causing Deirdre to jump.

We lost that mirror, but as far as damage goes, it’s minor. I wasn’t able to breathe easily until the crossroads was far in my rearview mirror. 

“We’re taking the long way around on the way back.” I swore, willing the trembling in my hands to stop.

Equally as shaken up, Deirdre nodded quickly as she gaped at where the side mirror had once been, “I think that would be best.”

To my relief, the rest of our trip to the farm was uneventful save for some idiot cutting me off, then going ten miles under the speed limit because *why not?* 

The rams, thankfully, were agreeable as they were loaded up into the truck’s bed, then secured with rope. For the record, I always feel terrible whenever we have to resort to animal sacrifices, but if I have to choose between animals and people, I will always pick people. No matter how much I want to run them off the road sometimes. 

With the rams acquired, the next step was to perform the ritual and hope that our substitutions were acceptable. Before returning to the farmhand’s home, I stopped by my apartment to fetch a white sheet and every piece of white clothing that I owned, which admittedly wasn’t much. 

I ended up returning to the truck donning a white turtleneck that’s been in the back of my closet for God-knows-how-long, a pair of white skinny jeans that were left over from my extremely unfortunate days as a wannabe emo (I’m amazed that they still fit, by the way. Though they are a tad snug), and white cowboy boots from when my mother and I attended a bachelorette party in Nashville. 

In other words, I looked absolutely ridiculous. But the ritual called for color coordination, not haute couture.

When Reyna saw me upon our return to the farmhand’s home, she snorted, having to clap a hand over her mouth, quickly apologizing soon after. Even the farmhand did a double take. My milkshake was not bringing all the boys to the yard that evening. 

With that mild embarrassment out of the way, next was to get the supplies and find the tree that Victor had been referring to. I thought I knew which one it was, since there is an oak I pass by on my way to the mechanic’s clearing that’s hard to miss. It’s a pretty tree with a curved trunk and proud branches that reach to the sky as if to embrace it. Of course, it is a forest, so there was bound to be more than one. 

Speaking of the boss, Reyna wasn’t able to reach him either. That worried me. Of course, there was nothing that could be done about it at the moment. We just had to hold our breath and hope that everything was alright. 

We brought the farmhand along with us. For one, we wanted to be able to give him the experimental treatment as soon as possible. For another, we didn’t want to leave him alone in case the mechanic came looking for him. We just had to pray that no other victims of the grass would be targeted in the meantime.

On another note, I don’t understand how I wore skinny jeans so much as a young ‘un. They’re *so* uncomfortable. They weren’t flattering either. I promised myself that once the ritual was complete, those hellish jeans were going straight to a thrift store. 

The farmhand was a good sport as we wandered around, the rams being led along like dogs by their ropes while we looked for the mistletoe. In turn, I had taken the truck’s ladder with us, not keen on having to climb a tree in horrifically tight pants whilst feeling under the weather. 

After I couldn't feel my nose anymore from the chill in the air, we finally found it. Above our heads, one of the oak’s branches was being overwhelmed with parasitic mistletoe growth.

Working quickly and quietly, we secured the rams, then Reyna and Deirdre held the white sheet open underneath the branch, ready to catch the mistletoe when it was cut down. 

After all of the other preparations were complete, I got the ladder into position, finding that it was a tad too low, but determined that it should be close enough that I could get at least a few pieces off. Being tall has its perks sometimes.

I had to stand precariously on tiptoe on the top rung, but managed to get it with my silver knife. The newly-cut fronds fluttered gently down onto the white sheet while my colleagues were careful to not let a single one touch the ground. 

While I concentrated on this task, I could hear them discussing the next steps, and the one I was looking forward to the least: the slaughter. We had to pick a god to invoke. While Gwyn ap Nudd has an interest in Orion, I didn’t think he’d give a flying fuck about blessing an experimental concoction for a human he wasn’t interested in. That could easily backfire. 

Deirdre’s eyes suddenly became glazed in the same way as they do whenever she receives premonitions. Even more bizarrely, I saw a new addition to her shadow in the dim winter light: something was perched on her rippling shoulder. A bird? 

Reyna and I glanced at each other. Shakily, I descended the ladder, my arms aching from the effort. To tell the truth, I had begun to feel sore all over. And despite the frigid temperature, I was sweating profusely.

Once I'd dismounted the ladder, it was time to do the hard part. I faced the rams with the silver knife, a pit in my stomach and a lump in my throat as I steeled myself for what I was about to do. While in her trance, Deirdre spoke to me in Gaelic, having me repeat every word she said. I stumbled through it, noting that *Morrígan* was used in this invocation.  

When it comes to the sacrifice, I promise that I did my best to make it as painless for them as possible. But they screamed. They shrieked and their blood coated my hands, feeling hot as molten fire, the liquid steaming as it became exposed to the cold. The terrible white outfit became a splattered canvas.

Some of the blood was collected for the concoction. The rest coated the snow. I remember sending out a second prayer that these animals’ lives weren't taken in vain. 

Meanwhile, Reyna and Dierdre got to work. The shadow bird stayed on her shoulder the entire time, occasionally tilting its head or stretching its wings. Her eyes were still glazed and distant, though she was keeping up with Reyna flawlessly. 

During all of this, the farmhand was slumped against one of the trees, head hanging low. He hadn’t questioned anything so far. Due to his profession, he might’ve had his fair share of atypical experiences prior to his unfortunate encounter with the Hunger Grass. Like I've said in the past, the farm folk around here are a hardy bunch. 

Reyna abruptly halted her work, eyes huge, “Guys, my hagstone! Something's here!”

The mechanic’s voice came from nowhere, giving me a heart attack, “So this is what you were really up to?”

Iolo looked like something from a nightmare. He was covered in blood, though it didn’t appear to all be his. There was a bullet wound above his right eyebrow, as well as numerous in his chest. By the tightness of his jaw and the way his eyes blazed, it was clear that Wes had done his job a little too well. The mechanic was *livid.*

Whenever he was in this state, he was reactive. Dangerous. Now was *not* the time to try anything funny. 

The farmhand tried to scramble away from him. He made the mistake of meeting Iolo's eyes. I tried to step in between them to break the Huntsman's line of sight, but it was too late. 

The farmhand’s eyes rolled back in his head as he crumpled to the ground. Reyna let out a sound that was somewhere between a gasp and a scream. Deirdre still seemed out of it as she kept adding more mistletoe to the mixture.

As I rushed to him, it took everything I had to keep my tone as neutral as possible, “What did you-” 

“Don’t get all panicked, he’s fine,” Iolo snapped, cutting me off. “He just ain’t gonna remember shit.”

Reyna found her voice, though it came out as a terrified squeak, “Please just give us a minute.”

His smile wasn’t friendly, made even more menacing by the blood coating his cheeks. “Why, sure! I’m *dyin’* to see what you all cooked up.”

While he watched them, arms crossed, I did my best in my fatigue to drag the farmhand over to somewhere more comfortable. He was out cold. Probably for the best. 

In the end, I settled with leaning him against the oak’s trunk, unable to find anywhere that didn’t have snow for him to sit. Poor guy was going to be freezing when he woke up. But even if I didn't feel like my brain was being sawed in half, lifting him would be difficult. 

Once I got the farmhand situated, I marched over to the mechanic, breathlessly asking, “My colleague? Is he still alive?”

“I didn’t kill your coworker,” He replied curtly. “Just made him wish I did.”

I knew it was going to be bad. *Shit.*

“If I’d told you what we were doing, would you have stopped us?” I challenged softly.

“Probably,” Was his frustrating answer, but then he continued. “I get it. Ain't happy about it, but I get it. Same reason why I waited to tell y’all about how the bread crumb thing was bullshit.”

Truthfully, I'd expected that conversation to go worse. A lot worse. 

In the meantime, Reyna kept nervously glancing at him from the corner of her eye, which unfortunately, activated the banjo bastard’s prey drive. 

Smirking, he mocked her, “Somethin’ spookin' ya, witchdoctor?”

“Please leave her alone.” I urged, resisting the impulse to be more forceful. I didn't like that look in his eye. 

After that, Reyna kept her head down, mouth set firmly as she focused on her work. 

Still sounding strangely distant, Deirdre eventually announced that the mixture was done.

Iolo watched Reyna in a way that made me glad she was diligent about keeping her hagstone on her as she poured a few drops of the mistletoe concoction down into the unconscious farmhand’s mouth. Silently, I prayed that this would work. That we hadn’t just strung this poor man along, giving him false hope. That we hadn’t just led him right to his executioner. I stared at his shadow, willing it to match its owner. Willing it to stop reminding me so much of the Hungry Man.

*Please work. Please work.* 

The farmhand coughed. His silhouette began to change, filling out, resembling a balloon being inflated, as strange as that comparison might be. 

Still smirking, the mechanic told Reyna, “I s’pose I stand corrected.”

Her and I exchanged an astonished glance, then seemingly without thinking, she let out a soft sob of relief, having started crying from the stress of her situation. At a glance, Deirdre looked disoriented, as if she had just woken up. The strange bird on her silhouette’s shoulder was gone. 

“Well, that saves me time tonight,” The mechanic chirped, looking down at his gore-covered arms in disdain. “Now, if y’all will excuse me, I gotta get all this vamp blood offa me. No trainin’ tonight, by the way! I’ve had enough o’ you for one day.”

The feeling was mutual. *Good riddance, banjo bastard.*

To everyone’s relief, he departed just as quickly as he had appeared. The first thing I did was call Wes, knowing that whatever state he was in couldn’t be pleasant.

However, when he answered, he sounded more inconvenienced than anything else, “Yeah, I’m fine. Just gotta *pull myself together.* You know how it is.”

Well, if he was punning, he couldn’t be that bad off. However, the implications of that pun were gruesome.

“Wes, seriously.” 

“Yeah, it hurts, and your boyfriend is a dick, but I’ll be back to normal in about five more minutes. Just don’t come looking for me. I’m feeling a bit peckish after all of that.”

At the ‘boyfriend’ joke, I glared into the distance as I playfully threatened him, “You want me to go over there and finish what he started?”

There was a horrible crack. When asked, he nonchalantly replied, “I just had to put my arm back into its socket real quick. Hey, I’ll see you at work, alright?”

“Yeah. Okay. See you.” I replied numbly. 

Are all vampires like this or just ours? At least I knew he was okay. Relatively speaking.  

Now that I could be assured that my colleague wasn't lying dead in the snow somewhere, the next thing was to check on Deirdre. She had been aware of everything that was going on, but she was also attuned to something beyond the veil. That shadowy bird had acted as a guide, ensuring that the ritual would go the way it was supposed to. 

At the same time, the farmhand had woken up, not knowing why he was in the woods. The last thing that he recalled was drinking the rice coffee. At least the mechanic hadn't screwed with his memory too horribly. The poor guy was discombobulated, but let us lead him back to the truck without protest. 

Reyna and Deirdre made plans to locate and spread the treatment to the other victims of the Hunger Grass that were still alive, though they insisted that I wasn't going to be a part of it. 

“You. Need. *Rest!*” Deirdre told me firmly. 

I didn't have the energy to disagree with her anymore. 

That's part of the reason why it took me a day later than anticipated to update yinz: once they dropped me off at my apartment, I ripped off my terrible, too-tight clothes, washed the blood off of me, then went into what could be best described as a minor coma for twelve hours. By the time I finally returned to the land of the living, I numbly realized that I'd missed half a day of work. 

In a panic, I called Victor. 

I'm truly lucky to have such a good boss. “You're fine. Deirdre and Reyna filled me in on what happened. Ergo, I'm making you take tomorrow as well as the following two days off. Paid, of course.”

“Okay. Thanks.” My brain took a moment to catch up, but once it booted up like an old computer, I finally became cognizant enough to ask, “By the way, what the hell happened to you?”

After our talk the day before, Victor had determined that the best way to convince this real estate development company that they were dealing with more than just some townies’ campfire stories was to have one of them contend with an atypical infestation themselves. And if that chairperson didn't cooperate, then another would be targeted and so on until they finally got the point. 

Naturally, my jaw dropped. I could see why he’d thought I’d talk him out of it. He had resorted to using Charles Dickens tactics. 

Of course, he had to find a Neighbor to act as his Ghost of Real Estate Development Future. He determined that he needed an atypical pest that was frightening enough to spook the chairperson, but not cause them any physical harm. A tall order, considering how the Neighbors feel about this development company and human greed in general. Can't say I blame them. 

I can't stress enough that *nobody* wanted The Avalon to be built. Humans and Neighbors were united on that front. 

Victor's first thought had been Housekeepers. They're pretty standard, as far as atypical infestations go, and to those not accustomed to their presence, they can be alarming to encounter. However, transformations cause them to become violent and unstable, which is a liability. 

Dreamers wouldn't have been ideal either. It'd be too easy for someone to rationalize an attack from one of them as a nightmare or the result of sleep paralysis-induced hallucinations. 

Lastly, the False Tree would probably kill the chairperson on sight if it figured out that he was one of the humans responsible for the construction in its territory. So, what did that leave? 

The answer floored me: a Wild Huntsman. Namely, a certain thorny boi. 

“At first, a Huntsman - particularly *that* Huntsman - was last on my list of potential collaborators.” Victor had explained. “But as far as Neighbors go, they have a remarkable degree of self-control. They're not as prone to acting on instinct. It's just a matter of finding the right bribe and when it comes to that, Briar is the easiest to work with.”

With some reluctance, I asked, “What did you have to promise him in return?”

After a heavy sigh, Victor admitted, “The next time we find bedbugs, he wants me to capture a few of them alive, then plant them in the bed of someone who pulled a gun on him during a repo call.”

There is a lot to unpack in that sentence. I wonder if that's Briar's way of starting the ‘breaking down’ process with whoever this gunslinger is or if he just likes the idea of petty revenge. After talking with Vic more, I think it may be a combination of the two. 

Anyways, when they made this agreement, Victor gave him the stipulation that he couldn't cause any physical harm to their target or anyone else for the duration of this task. 

I pointed out, “Now he knows that guy's address.”

“He knew the address beforehand,” Victor told me to my shock. “He also knew the chairperson's name, seeing as how it's publicly available on the company's website. The entire board has already been on the Hunt's radar. They've got something in mind for them. Just not sure what yet.”

While Wes, the mechanic, and I were contending with the Hunger Grass, the head chairperson of that development company had called Orion’s emergency line in a panic due to black thorns growing around the outside of his house, trapping him inside like something from a fairytale. When he tried to get out through his back door, he was terrified to see that there was an antlered, winged, goat-legged figure sitting in one of his patio chairs, waving at him.

After receiving the call, Victor had pretended to chase Briar off with a crucifix. There’s a part of me that wishes I could’ve seen that pantomime play out. In my imagination, it looked a bit like a fourth grade school musical. But that also could be the migraine talking. Making me loopy.  

Once he’d ‘rescued’ the chairperson, Victor then made up a story about how Briar was a guardian of the trees that they’d angered with these repeated attempts at expansion. Even though Victor pretty much plagiarized *The Lorax,* it was enough for ~~the Onceler~~ the chairperson to profess that he was going to strongly suggest halting the project permanently when he met with his colleagues the following day. 

It made local headlines when The Avalon's construction was declared to have been postponed indefinitely. 

Once Victor's recollection had concluded, I told him honestly, “I'm actually amazed that worked.”

“You and me both.” He agreed brusquely. “But for how long, I'm not sure.”

I then filled him in on everything that happened on my end, including the newfound knowledge that a Wood Maiden was the culprit for the Hunger Grass outbreak. Victor is a bit more well-versed in Norse atypical infestations than I am, so he was able to shed some light on the Wood Maiden's behavior. 

They are extremely territorial to the point of rivaling a False Tree. However, I would argue that the Wood Maiden was worse; the False Tree has never tried to commit terrorism on the entire county before. It just focused on the specific perpetrators. Though, the Wood Maiden has a good reason for her hostility. Her life force is tied to a single tree: if that tree dies, so does she.

**1. Be Clear and Specific**

Instead of: “Write a blog about AI.” 

Try: “Write a 500-word blog post about the benefits of AI for small businesses.” Specific prompts get specific results. Think details, details, details!

**2. Set the Role or Context**

Example: “Act as a marketing expert and write a social media strategy for a coffee shop.” Want tailored advice? Tell ChatGPT who to be, it’s like hiring the expert you need! | |

**3. Break Down Complex Requests**

Instead of: “Explain quantum computing.” 

Try: “Explain quantum computing in simple terms for a 12-year-old.” The clearer your audience, the better the explanation. | |

**4. Ask for Step-by-Step Output**

Example: “Provide a step-by-step guide for setting up a small business budget.” Structure = clarity. Ask for steps to get actionable advice.

**5. Iterate and Refine**

If the response isn’t quite right, provide feedback: 

“Make the tone more casual.” 

“Add examples to the explanation.” Think of ChatGPT as your creative partner to refine, tweak, and perfect your results.""

When he was sick he'd take days off for himself, but when I was sick, he'd go to work and leave me to care for our daughter, and not offer to do anything, he'd only say ""I hope you feel better"".

1i1jm5n,https://investcit.com/,Knob hill residents- ever heard of a community investment trust? Thoughts on “improving” the platte corridor?,"I’m a lifelong Springs resident and home owner in Knob Hill and something that has always stood out to me is that the platte corridor and surrounding areas actually have the “bones” to be a super nice, walkable space similar to downtown. I’m .5 miles away from 4 different coffee shops, very close to a lot of places I enjoy going (shout out to what’s left, black sheep, vultures, yellow king..) and we even have some good parks in our area. 

The problem I see is we don’t have enough “attractive” businesses - I.e a lot of properties need attention no investors want to give, and a lot of businesses are used vehicle stores, industrial shops, etc. Put that together with general waning infrastructure (lack of trees and sidewalks) plus safety concerns.. it’s a waste of what could be a really vibrant area. 

That said, I hate gentrifying the shit out of neighborhoods and having investors who don’t gaf about the surrounding area own and neglect large swaths of land. 

Recently read about the idea of a Community Investment Trust- the idea being that a trust buys a commercial property, fixes it up, and specifically rents to tenants that are important to the surrounding area and would bring value. People in the area are able to invest in the property after taking a course that discusses investments and financial literacy, and can contribute $10-$100 as an investment per month. The people who live in the area become owners of the property, and have a tangible connection to seeing these businesses succeed. 

The site I’ve linked to discusses how this has been done in Oregon and that the community members have seen 9% returns and tenancy in the property is over 90%. The focus of the trust isn’t to make a crazy profit, and the money made goes back into those living near by who invest, but the key is that the property is well maintained and the properties are being used for valuable businesses. 

There’s a lot of properties for sale along the platte corridor and I could see being used better, and I feel like this could be a viable way to improve the area. Thoughts, ideas? Would you invest in commercial properties like this? ",5,1736897073.0,ColoradoSprings,4,0.86,False

I choose sobriety from now on, and I wrote this today on day 4, as a reflection on recently turning 27 and trying to re-configure my sense of purpose towards adventure, a life liberated of the insidious whisperings of alcohol. ( I'm not expecting a response, just wanted to fire this off into the void as a sort of ceremonious wager with the universe).

  
I am listening to ambience, sitting in a coffee shop located 2 minutes from my little basement suite on the *other* side of the river. My mind is electric; I consider the slow leak in my vehicle’s tire, I bristle at the thought of stupid, drunken, ruinous weekend antics, I finally begin to mourn the ending of a relationship, and all the while I struggle to grasp at the slippery tendrils of academia; a means of achieving some semblance of momentary emotional equilibrium. I am exhausted, cerebrally husked from deep conversations, anxiety, and deeper ponderings. The past is raw, the present is turbulent, the future is veiled. There is a sense of drifting, unwelcomeness in familiarity, chemical separation, vibrating uncertainty; this is liminality between myself and *my* self. Perspective shifts to the third, and I gaze at my corporeality throughout the day as it wanders through the spaces of my typical goings; it haunts of comfort. There is an untethering that, seemingly, codes as permanent.

A shock, a simple fix, a conscious re-constituting is in order. The antidotal requirement is experience, serendipitously, experience of the sort that has been my object of study for years. Necessary to these experiences is presence, necessary to presence is focus, and necessary to focus, is the self. To re-tether is to work towards corporeal-mental re-homogenization, a feat that demands a paradoxical turn towards voluntary involuntariness. I commit to this attempt at re-calibration, and as such, to the vital materiality of nature. These spaces and places that heal the human spirit through their gifts to our senses.

So will this have an effect on my withdrawal timing? Am I back to square one with quitting and all the symptoms?

For a bit of context my grandparents passed away when I was 18 and left me their house which they bought 60 years ago for 20k but with the real estate these days I sold it 4 years ago for 4.5 million. I used the money to build my dream house (excuse the rant but I'm obsessed with it) the exterior is dark cottagecore inspired and the interior is dark modern with only black, brown and burgundy shades. It has a huge kitchen because I like cooking a lot, 4 bedrooms (one is for the dogs, one I turned into a closet, my bedroom and the guestroom) , a big yard for my 6 dogs, a garage and an attic i made into an office/reading space. I adore it and I'll never stop ranting about it lol. 

Now the problem is my fiance's friends. They have exactly 0 respect for other people's homes. They make a mess, don't care about breaking stuff, put their muddy boots on the coffee table, PLAY FOOTBALL INSIDE and don't even get me started on how loud they are. I can't stand it anymore. I've asked several times for something to change and it hasn't. My fiance always scolds them and reminds them of basic decency but after 5 minutes they go back to it. 

I put my foot down and I gave my fiance 2 options: 1- turning the garage into a hangout spot for them or 2- they find another place to meet because I can no longer tolerate this behavior. I have 6 dogs and they have better indoor manners than these grown ass men. 

My fiance is now upset with me because he finds the first option embarrassing and doesn't want to tell his friends they are not allowed inside but he also doesn't want to find a different place to go because going out costs money. 

He's mad at me for giving him an ultimatum. He doesn't think it's such a big deal to the point of not having them over however I disagree. 1. These hang outs happened every other day so every 2 days my house is in chaos. I work from home and this is starting to affect my work because it happened multiple times that I got scolded by my boss because during a meeting they were screaming downstairs. It's embarrassing and I don't need issues at work. 2. Like i said, they make a mess which takes 2-3h to clean with both of us cleaning. I'm sick of that as well. 3. This is what I have the biggest issue with - breaking things. They. Break. Stuff. Almost. Every. Single. Time. Stuff that they don't pay to replace because they can't afford and stuff that is unreplaceable like for example a painting made by my mom they knocked over or my grandpa's desk they broke by trying to pick it up and dropping it.

I don't think I'm being unreasonable to not want them in my home considering these maniacs tear my house apart every visit. Especially since I offered to make the garage into a hangout spot with a couch and tv and video games, pool table and whatever else. I feel like that's a good compromise. They can hang out without bothering me and racking my home. Idk how that's not a reasonable solution.

I caught her meeting a guy when she was 22yrs old(we dated for 3yrs at this point). She lied that she were just going for a coffee and I stupidly believed her. And eventually forgave her.

I asked her if that was all they did and she lied to me every single time for 18yrs basically.

I found some evidence by accident and pressed her and she finnaly confessed after 18yrs!!!

She was a serial cheater. She already went on a day trip with him and kissed him while drunk. After I forgave her(without knowing the full detail), they contacted again 2 yrs after. She was ""convinced"" to go to hotel with him. She said she stopped as soon as she felt his penis. Of course I didn't believe that but she took the polygraph test willingly and passed the test. She told me she went to a clinic right after because she was in panic mode that she briefly had sex with someone else. I magically found a clinic she went to and I read the medical chart(from 2008!!!!). It was really ""just the tip"" and the doctor didn't give her plan B(we lived overseas and she needed a prescription to get it). She could have lied to the doctor but well... I think she never thought I was gonna find this out. The guy was mad at her and they never met after. Edit: we are from a small town and there are only 3 clinics. I found the clinc she went to. Wife called the clinic. After verifying her id and they told  her why she visited there in 2008. She was on speaker and I was beside her.

She didn't learn her lesson after that incident. She cheated 2 more times with different guys. They were more like flings. She went out with them and kissed them a few times. I absolutely had no idea about these but she confessed. So she cheated multiple time after I forgave her first cheating.

If I believe polygraph test, everything she told me is true and she didn't cheat after we got married(we moved to US after we got married). Kids are mine.

She is a caring person who always took care of me but was very indecisive and relied on other people(mostly me when I am available. Other men replaced me when I was not available I guess) . Our marriage was very good. So it is very shocking that she had(still has) this dark side.

Since we have young children, Divorce would be very hard. Cheating is a deal break for me but kids wellbeing is my main focus. I feel dumb even thinking about give her 3rd chance!!

She understands how horrible she was and how badly it damaged our marriage. So she told me she will give up everything we have including a custody if we get a divorce. And begged me to take her back to my and our kid's life again when my anger decreases a bit.

I don't know what to do. I am very logical guy who strongly believe ""fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice shame on me"".

Would you forgive serial cheating before marriage if it were not full blown affairs?

No surprise there, I would be too. ""I thought it was some friend but I don't know this person and they look... off.""

""Okay ma'am..."" Nudging my chair closer to the desk as I begin typing on the computer, I asked the lady another question in the meantime. ""Can you give me your address and tell me if you can see if this person is armed?""

""Yeah... yeah, I'm the yellow house at \[...\]. He--...."" The woman continued but I admit, I didn't listen. She had just given my house address. I stopped my fingers in the middle of writing and sighed, thinking this must be one of my friends. We're a small bunch and very mischievous towards each other, sort of out of character for our age I must admit, but I've said numerous times how serious prank-calling 911 can be for people.

""Who is this? You know how badly this can end for you, right?"" I reached for my coffee cup, rolling my eyes and held my hand ready to hang up the call, but she continued.

""What? I don't get it, I'm serious! Please don't hang up."" She retorted in a tone that caught me off-guard, and then again after a second she returned to the previous, somewhat panicked attitude. ""I'm sorry... but this isn't a joke, please, I'm afraid for what this person might do.""

""Okay ma'am."" I put the cup back on the desk and was ready to prolong this call to enough of an extent to either make this woman face the consequences for holding the line. What bad luck for her, I thought, to get the operator living at the exact house she decided would be her target. ""What's your name and which room are you in right now?""

""I'm Marielle. I'm looking out my bedroom window right now. They're still there.""

My blood started to boil. How senseless this person must be, it was obviously a friend. I raised my voice this time, warning them again about how badly they will regret their actions if they prank call again, and just as I was about to hang up ""Marielle"" started to beg me frantically not to. For whatever reason something inside me was telling me to listen.

I decided to give her one more chance and then I would send the police over to arrest this prank caller and at the very least give her a slap on the wrist.

""Okay, Marielle. Describe the bedroom to me.""

""What?""

""You heard me. What color are the curtains? Is there any furniture? Lamps? Tell me what you can see.""

Though I've known said friends for quite a while now none of them have ever been in my house. I prefer it that way, not because I don't trust them to enter my home but because I've never been fond of having guests, neither did my parents when I was little. It's something they had that has transferred over to me. There's no way this person would--

""Uh, purple curtains... double bed with a grey-ish cover with white lines... a wardrobe and a small bedside table with a nightlamp on it..."" She went on for a few seconds while I listened, completely dumbfounded. She was describing exactly how my bedroom looked. Her next words snapped me out of the confusion. ""Miss, why you asking me this? There's someone outside my house!""

I couldn't answer her immediately. This was just so surreal, nothing like anything I'd experienced so far in this job. This woman, apparently named Marielle, who sounds just like me, claiming she lives at my address, and is standing in the exact same bedroom as mine, was talking to me, Marielle. How did any of this make sense?

I tried to keep my cool and continue talking to her normally but I could hear the shakiness in my own voice when all I could mutter was an ""okay ma'am..."" before falling silent again and rummaged around my desk drawer to find my personal phone. My ex husband had installed security cameras facing the front, back and sides of our house at different angles after some people started talking about the same car driving around their house multiple times during the day and night, but nothing ever came out of it. It didn't hurt to have the extra security measure, but I never thought I'd actually have to use it.

I opened the app while this Marielle kept repeating hello, but I was too preoccupied to answer. I admit my heart had dropped into my stomach at this point, and it only got worse after I opened the camera app. My bedroom window looked out of one of the sides of my house and right beyond the wooden fence was someone pacing left and right while looking up at the house. I finally snapped back.

""Okay Marielle... okay. I'm sending a patrol car your way immediately. Excuse the holdup."" I tried to regain my composure but could still hear my words trembling as I spoke them out loud. While the person wasn't trespassing and technically not committing any crime, what puzzled me more was that I was currently, completely free of any alcohol or drug influence, was talking to myself. ""Move away from the window to make sure he doesn't see you. Do you--"" I paused for a moment taking in how ridiculous the whole situation was again, and finished my question, listening intently for the answer that was about to come from the other Marielle, not sure what I was expecting to hear. ""Do you have a weapon in your house you could use in case his intentions become malevolent?""

""I mean, the only thing I can think of right now are the knives in the kitchen... and there's an old pistol but it's in the basement and the door to it is outside. Am I going to have to defend myself?"" She sounded stressed out as she asked, but I was more shocked to hear the same exact words I'd have said in reply to this question. I have a pistol, and it's in the basement, the door to which is outside.

Still unable to comprehend all of this I told Marielle, or me I guess, to check again and see where the person is and reassured her that the patrol car is only a few minutes away from the house. Only now did I finally look around, thinking that I must be dreaming, and caught the gaze of a fellow coworker who had his eyebrow raised. He must have been listening in to my conversation and seen me acting off, but I tried to smile to the best of my ability and nod, quickly returning my focus to my screen before I could see his reaction.

""Marielle? Do you see them still?"" I inquired but got no response for another few moments. She then stumbled on her words and I could hear the door creaking open just as my bedroom door did, and her footsteps rapidly moving from room to room, presumably looking out other windows.

""I... no, no. No, he's not out there now. I don't know where he is. Oh God, did I miss him? Is he coming towards my house?"" She sounded like she was on the verge of a panic attack. I did my best trying to calm her down while searching for the person myself, switching between different cameras, and when I found him I saw him in the backyard with an arm raised in the middle of the air. Moments later a rock flew towards my kitchen window, and though the cameras have no audio to them, Marielle's shriek was perfectly timed in sync with the impact. ""Holy shit! Holy shit, he just broke on of my windows!"" She began franticly and began raving inaudibly into the phone.

""Marielle! Marielle, get to your attic! Quickly! The police will be at your place soon! Use anything you find up there to block the way in!"" I yelled back, raising my voice loud enough to overshadow hers and to probably scare my coworkers with the sudden decibel increase. Whatever was happening, it was real, there was someone outside my house who had just broken a window and I was in there, afraid for my life. The advice I gave her was exactly what I would have done - the attic hatch is in the middle of the hallway leading from the living room to my bedroom, giving her enough time to get up there and block it afterwards considering this person had to pass through the kitchen and then through the aforementioned parts of the house. By my calculations Marielle had enough time to get there and use all the pent-up trash and whatever else she could find to hold the hatch shut for the little time left the police needed to arrive.

I could hear Marielle slam the door behind her and run, running down the laminated hallway towards the hatch, and then I gasped audibly as she yelled into the speaker and the phone dropped with a loud thud, her footsteps becoming more and more distant as another, heavier set made their way faster and faster through the hallway and closer to the phone.

""Are you still there? The police are almost at your location!"" Was all I could think to say in my last effort to scare whoever this person was away. A few seconds of silence and I expected to hear something, anything - some scary, cryptid remark or at least breathing, but there was nothing. My last words into the receiver was hello before the other end hung up.

I couldn't believe what had just happened, and must have sat at my desk staring into the screen for at least two minutes before the same coworker from earlier, Connor, came and put his hand on my shoulder, prompting me to scream and push him away. The entire office looked our way and he put his hands up in the air. I apologized profusely more times than I could count, everyone turned back to their desks and Connor lowered his hands.

""Tough call?"" He asked and leaned on my desk, handing me a chocolate bar. ""You seemed really on edge the entire time and, well... this just confirms it.""

I didn't even acknowledge the snack after I looked at it and just met his eyes again, not even knowing what to say. I began with a few disconnected words before excusing myself and leaving the shift early.

It's a little after 02:30 as I finish writing this. I booked myself a room into the most crowded hotel I could find with the room closest to the stairs leading to the reception, shutting the blinds and locking the door twice. I'm afraid to go home, and I don't know who to talk to about this without sounding completely insane. I've heard nothing from the responding police officers yet and I don't know what to do about this tomorrow. Anyone reading this, please believe me, and even if you don't, can you please offer me some advise?

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

I started speaking to this female late last year, approximately 1 month ago tomorrow, we met on hinge and moved over to texting on SMS a few days after. I'd like to say we hit it off quite good, having decent pace in texting, not too much not to little. We were both MIA over Christmas and new years so didn't get to meet each other during the holidays sadly enough. Fast forward to when we were both back from vacation we setup a short coffee date which ended up being 2 hours long, considering it just a fast date and we both appreciated each other company we decided to setup another date 2 days after, going out for a couple of drinks. We were out together for a solid 6-7 hours bar hopping around the city and taking decently long walks in between each place to not get too drunk. Towards the middle/end of the evening before we went to last bar I decided to pull her in and we had our first kiss, which lead to holding hands walking around in the snow kissing at random spots before having the final drink at the bar before parting ways. 

**Note:** during the date I asked her what she was looking for in the dating and she stated that she wasn't really sure what she wanted as shes kinda young still, her words. Personally I'm kinda in the same way that I don't know what I'm looking for at the moment, never really been in any previous relationships and nor has she according to her. 

After the date she stated she was super happy about the night and that it was so easy talking to me without probably a single awkward moment throughout these 10-hours total we have spent together, during the end of the date we started planning our next date which would of taken place during this week (tomorrow to be exact), she stated as she was free from her uni this whole week but that she trying to get some extra shift in to speed up the time and prevent doing nothing. 

Monday (yesterday) she spent the night at a girlfriends house in another city and she said shes still keen to meet up for a long walk on Wednesday after my work (i work fulltime). She dmed me this morning apologizing saying she couldn't make it in time to the date today as she was still in the city and couldn't get home in time for our specified time. Then dms me a little bit later saying she got confused about what day it was and took wrong date as it would of gone done tomorrow, a fast forward a few texts after we had figured out time and place where I was supposed to meet her at tomorrow without any problems. After that she shoots me a text approximately 1 hour after we had figured out all the details saying shes fully booked due to her work from tonight until sunday evening so our walk can't go down *(shes working on a boat so she won't leave the boat at all until sunday)* 

In this message she didn't try to reschedule or saying lets do it next week or w/e. So i pretty much said oh no worries, job goes first perhaps we should move all the plans to next week if you are still down? then she said yes absolutely that sounds great, sorry again that it had to be like this, typical to know that im supposed to work only a few hours before it starts. I was like shit like that happens no worries, we figure it out next week!

My question is do I keep talking to her to keep her interested and seeing how it plays out during next week if she continues to come up with excuses that she can't meet up etc? My friend had also seen her on hinge yesterday and it said ""Active now"" so shes still on dating apps, I know this is not really a problem at all since we are not in a relationship nor are exclusive in any sort of way, but since she didn't try to reschedule at all it kinda feels like im on the back-burner while shes looking for something else (possibly better) or should I take a step back and see if she entertain it more with the next date (if it comes to that point? I know I have already said let's plan it out next week but yeah not sure on how to proceed

Appreciate any advice on how to proceed, thanks in advance!

Is he right??","If you wish to see my full, lengthy life story of medical context, you can do so by looking at my previous posts.

But TLDR, I've had short episodes of globus sensation and difficulty swallowing since I was about 12 years old. The longest episode back then lasted about a month. Flash forward to last August after a bout of covid, and the globus sensation (feeling like something is stuck in my throat) and trouble swallowing are back full time and have not gotten better since. Endoscopy found a hill grade 4 hiatal hernia (2 cm) but no damage to my esophagus, so he said the hernia wasn't a big deal and I wouldn't need surgery and it probably wasn't the cause of my symptoms. He said it was probably just GERD and put me on 40mg of Nexium/esomeprazole. After 2 months or so of religiously using the medication, I have had barely any improvement if at all.

So... is he correct in telling me that my grade 4 hiatal hernia is no big deal and probably not causing symptoms? Is he correct that I don't need surgery?

Should i split up and add flavors to a plain 1G batch once it’s in secondary, or would it be better to do all that in primary? 

Any special steps to preventing infection or improving flavor with these kinds of drinks? 

I know the drinks should be flat before adding them into the brew, would the bottle carbonation process be any different? ",1,1736895255.0,mead,2,0.67,False

Have you ever had trouble processing or interpreting the manga's art in some way, shape, or form? Apparently, it's not that uncommon in the community, as I've seen quite a few people express this, and hopefully I can alleviate that to some extent with posts like this going forward. These posts aren't intended as a replacement for the chapters; rather, they're intended as a page-by-page point of reference and a log of details that you can hopefully reference as you read or reread the manga. Without further ado:

p1-5: Surrounded by darkness as far as the eye can see, Aging stands alone. Disoriented, he looks around, trying to get his bearings, but with nothing to guide him, he contemplates his current location; as he looks upward, Aging is astonished as specks of light seem to manifest around him, standing out like stars in the night sky. As more of these specks appear, he wonders if Chainsaw Man consumed him at some point during the confusion of battle; he theorizes that, if he was erased, he might be in some kind of oblivion. As he turns and tries to take in the scale of the cosmos surrounding him, he suddenly stumbles upon another figure standing in the darkness, barely illuminated; freezing in shock, Aging stares at the ominous figure and tries to make out any notable details. As more of the figure's details come into focus, we see the strange man from Aging's world. He breaks the silence by stating that he and his companions once had faith in Aging; they were sure that Aging had chose them for some reason and that he had guided them to a deathless paradise. Aging's shocked expression fades, quickly replaced with concern; at the same time, tears well up in the strange man's eyes as his emotion swells. More light floods into the void, exposing it for what it is: a room constructed by the octopus devil's manifestation, with the suckers somehow serving as the light sources. In the center of the room, Chainsaw Man stands across from Aging, still partly obscured by shadow; ominously, the strange man's voice seemingly originates from Chainsaw Man as he demands to know why Aging would send a ""devil"" like Denji into their paradise. Charging forward, Chainsaw Man opens his mouth wide and the strange man emerges from it; as tears run down his face, he wraps his arms around Aging's neck and pulls the devil towards Chainsaw Man's mouth. With its job complete, the octopus devil's manifestation ends; inside the villa's ruins, one of the injured public safety agents looks up to the second Fumiko, confused. The second Fumiko brandishes some kind of dagger and looks down at the wounded agent; she smiles coldly, presumably planning to clean up loose strings after betraying public safety for Yoshida's benefit.

p6-10 (pages 6 and 7 are a double spread): Emerging from Denji's mouth, the strange man drags both Aging and Tadashi Hasegawa into Aging's world; the strange man falls to the ground, exhausted, and Denji buckles over as he wipes the sweat from his brow with his arm. Yoshida and Asa stand across from a deeply confused Aging, the two sides staring intently at each other; after a moment, Yoshida takes the initiative and breaks the ice by greeting Aging. Looking around, Aging slowly realizes that he's been brought into his world, but he's clearly confused about why. A tense few seconds pass as Yoshida waits to see what will happen, and Denji joins Yoshida and Asa across from Aging. When no harm comes to the trio, Yoshida feels confident enough in his theory to continue; emboldened, he pressures Aging and asks if he can take their lack of harm as proof that Aging is as powerless in his world as they are. As the situation finally clicks for Aging, the devil grows stern and asks if this was their plan from the start. Yoshida smiles coyly but dodges the question; instead, he offers to strike a contract with Aging. Echoing his bear parable, the contract will stipulate that both groups return to their respective worlds and never fight each other again. Trying to regain ground, Aging asks what they plan to do if he refuses; wiping his mouth, Denji states that he's the only person who can't leave through his mouth, so Aging would be stuck living with Denji for the rest of eternity. Distressed, Aging realizes that he's been entirely outmaneuvered and can't win.

p11-15: Back on earth, a massive group of civilians patrol the streets as an armed militia. Their weapons and tactics may be crude, but their numbers are strong enough that the group can encircle chainsaw cultists and overwhelm them with attacks from all sides; while they fight, unarmed civilians walk past the carnage, having become so desensitized to these battles that they treat it like a minor inconvenience. As the militia group passes a cafe, we find Denji, Asa, Fami, Yoshida, and Fumiko inside, ordering food and drink. Yoshida orders an iced coffee, Denji and Fami both order an entire chocolate cake, Fumiko orders orange juice, and Asa orders royal milk tea; interrupting the order, a chainsaw cultist busts down the door and runs inside the building. The cultist turns to face the group, chainsaws whirring, but before they can do anything, a member of the militia comes running in behind them, stabbing them several times; Fumiko and Yoshida turn to watch the fight, and Yoshida takes the opportunity to appreciate how they were able to return to their normal lives, showing that Aging eventually acquiesced and accepted the contract some time ago. Elsewhere, the strange man works on a construction site, sweating heavily as he pushes a wheelbarrow; he estimated that he was in Aging's world for over 80 years, so it's likely that he didn't have a life to return to nor the relevant skills for anything other than manual labor. Inside Aging's world, we learn that Tadashi Hasegawa is still trapped. He kneels in the snow, screaming desperately for help as he wants to leave as well; the fact that he was the individual who pushed hardest to erase Aging makes his fate deeply ironic as he is now trapped by the ""freedom"" from aging that he once sought.
