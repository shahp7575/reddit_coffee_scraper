The first one I tried was **The Librarian** from ***Sucreabeille*** *(patchouli, buttered rum, espresso)*. It's warm, sweet, slightly woody and almost floral. My friend said it smelled light and ""fizzy."" Tragically, after wearing it for a few months, it morphed into something unpleasant. A bizarre, damp and musty smell emerged. (I've now read multiple negative reviews of Sucreabeille products complaining about them smelling funky and musty long before they should go bad.) This week I tried **Dream Bean** from ***Osmofolia*** *(coffee beans, cocoa beans, vanilla beans, tonka beans, patchouli leaves, caramel, sandalwood incense)*. What a magical blend! It's dark, warm, sweet, and earthy. Not an obvious coffee scent, gives more of a general coffee shop vibe, lots of delicious smells harmonizing. Unfortunately, something about this specific patchouli note makes my brain conjure images of a health food store. Which isn't a bad thing, but it's not helping me have a good experience either, you know? Now I'm very curious if you have any patchouli + coffee recommendations!

1g7et59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g7et59/aita_for_a_having_a_private_investigator_follow/,AITA for a having a private investigator follow my wife (Twice)?,"Just to start off. This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

My wife (32F) and I (34m) have three kids together. The majority of are relationship has been amazing. We were the type of couple that would talk about everything with each other. We talked openly and honestly about everything. We would have sex regularly and quite often (for having 3 kids). We were even able to get two date nights a month. So form my perspective I thought we had a pretty good relationship.

I've been noticing some strange behavior from my wife lately. She started coming home late more often, and when I asked her about it, she would just brush it off. It felt off, so I decided to hire a private detective because I wanted to get to the bottom of this. I wasn't thrilled about that, but I felt like I had no choice.

I went to a private investigator (PI) and told him my suspicions about my wife. He managed to get some photos of her at a fancy restaurant with some guy. The PI said that he saw them there for about two and a half hours. I became very angry and sad and stormed out. I called my family and told them about what I had learned.

When I got home, my wife was crying on the couch. She showed me her phone. My family had gone off on her, sending her a bunch of nasty messages, calling her a cheater, and saying she was ruining our family. Calling her a whore and all kinds of other nasty names. I was surprised but still decided to confront her. I showed her the picture from the PI, and she started laughing through her tears. Then she started screaming at me and saying ""this is why your fucking family has been harassing me and calling me a whore! I was out with a client from work, and we were discussing a legal case.""

She then showed me her emails and texts from the other day with the client thanking her for dinner and talking about the case. I felt like a complete idiot. After my wife told me about why she was at the fancy restaurant with the other man, I apologized profusely. We talked about how silly it was for me to jump to conclusions, and I acknowledged that my family's behavior was completely out of line. I then called my family and told them that I really messed up and had acted impulsively. They ended up yelling at me about how stupid it was to hire a PI without talking to my wife first.

We were able to move past that incident, but a few weeks later, I started noticing my wife acting suspiciously again. She was distant, coming home late, and always on her phone. My anxiety got the best of me, and even though I swore I wouldn't do it again, I went back to the PI. This time, the PI found out that my wife had been spending a lot of time with another woman, going out to eat and to nightclubs. He showed me a picture, and I was shocked – it was my wife with my sister.

I told the PI it was nothing to worry about and that it was just my sister. I thought they might be planning a surprise birthday party for me, as my birthday was coming up soon. I decided not to talk to my wife about it because I didn't want to ruin the surprise. A few weeks later, my wife started acting strange in a different way. She told me she felt guilty because she hadn't actually been working late – she had been secretly spending a lot of time with my sister. I laughed and said I knew, and that they were planning my birthday party, right?

That's when she confessed. She's been sleeping with my sister. My head spun. I felt like I was in some bizarre reality show. All I could say was, ""With... with my sister?"" She started crying, saying she was so sorry, that it just happened, that they never meant to hurt me. Apparently, it started a few months ago, after a family get-together. They started talking more, going out for coffee, and then... things escalated.

AITA for getting a private investigator when my soon to be ex-wife was being suspicious?

I worked with Anderson Fields, the old magician, for almost two years as his live-in assistant. He didn’t perform any longer and he made it clear from the interview that he needed someone to handle the day to day trivialities of managing his estate. By this he meant the chores of cleaning, cooking, and readying his medication. I was more of a live-in nurse than a secretary, but the pay was nice and Anders (as he preferred to be called) knew that nurses had to follow strict rules and guidelines. Anders didn’t want to deal with anyone bound by laws other than his.

I should have pressed harder. Asked more questions about his condition. He lost control of his bladder at the end of my first year. Then, after a rare visit to the doctor, he needed help inserting a suppository every morning at six o’clock. My responsibilities kept growing, but so did the pay. I was saving thousands over a few months. Not many people get to say that these days.

Being entrusted with essential duties is very intense, and Anders was charming on top of that. He enjoyed feigning a senior moment just to reveal that he had pinched your wallet. I’d laugh and he’d laugh and his prank would be undone as soon as the trick was revealed. 

Anders was not as open about his drug use. This, I realized, was why a traditional nurse was out of the question for him. He’d stop in the middle of breakfast, or halt writing his memoirs, and disappear into the bathroom for half an hour. I learned that he was removing the medicine cabinet to reach a large hole in the drywall. He’d pull out an old, dusty shoebox and get to mixing some concoctions. When he learned to be honest with me, I asked him what he was taking.

“Psilocybin, amphetamines, uppers, downers, you name it,” he said, “Anything weaker than that and I just don’t get where I’m going.”

“You are old, Father William,” I reminded him.

“In my youth,” he recited, “I feared it might injure the brain; But now that I'm perfectly sure I have none, why, I do it again and again.""

He took an eye dropper and squeezed a single drop into his pipe. I asked him if it was LSD. He told me it was rarer than that. I might have asked more, but he knocked his potion back like a shot and took one long hit. He coughed out a massive cloud of gray smoke and smiled like a tired child.

“Please take care of me while I’m out,” he said, “I don’t know how long I’ll be gone.”

Then he’d look to be dead asleep for anywhere between one and three hours. I often carried him, drooling and limp, to his worn leather recliner. He weighed next to nothing. 

I thought I might as well let the old guy have his fun. He didn’t have any family left, or any that mattered, and I was the closest thing he had to a friend. It's almost cruel to say, but I thought Anders had done what he set out to do in life. He made his money and retired to a nice house. What happened next didn’t matter.

I thought that. Then Anders broke my wrist with a ball-peen hammer.

I was making breakfast. Three-egg omelet stuffed with sausage. I cracked the eggs and saw him standing in the kitchen doorway. He asked me what I was doing in his house. I thought it was one of his jokes. I told him I was going to finish cooking and then steal the family jewels. He yelled at me, waving his arms about. I tried to calm him down, apologize, but his quick hands conjured the hammer from nowhere and brought it down on my arm. I cussed and screamed at him until he collapsed, lip quivering, into a sobbing fetal position.

The whole thing took five minutes, but that was enough. I came back that evening with a cast over my right hand. He asked me how I got it. I told him the truth and found an extra ten-thousand dollars in my bank account.

We set some boundaries after that. I told him he should go to the hospital. He told me I should go to hell. There were no shoeboxes full of potions or pipes in the walls of the geriatric ward. Instead I agreed to stay so long as anything able to break a wrist was out of reach. We moved a lot of knick-knacks onto high shelves and dragged boxes of desk toys and paper weights into the shed out back. I chose the combination on the padlock. I didn’t want him to even have forks, but he talked me into it, and that was where we drew the line.

Before I might have called Ander’s drug use an intense hobby. Following his first episode, it was a fixation. The house reeked of his special concoction, and Anders was in a drugged-out stupor more days than not. At the longest he was out for almost 48 hours, writhing and crying and soiling himself. He started babbling as well. I tried to get him to slow down, working over a few days to suggest a tolerance break, but he wouldn’t hear it. 

“I just want to feel like myself again,“ he told me, “I’m not built for this world anymore. It’s chewed me up and soon it’s going to spit me out. I don’t see any reason to spend my last years here when I could be flying in the cosmos with the mome raths and slithy toves.”

I knew not to push further. I wasn’t a nurse. Hell, part of me wished he would break my other wrist for a quick payout.

“Half of the ingredients are misdirection, anyway,” he admitted, “Baby powder and rock candy. I just need time to make it right.”

“Right how?,” I asked him.

“You’d put me away if I told you.”

I pressed the matter, but he evaded direct answers. He assured me he wasn’t trying to kill himself or harm others. I negotiated a raise for “hazard pay”. He agreed to my initial request, plus 10%. Can’t argue with that.

I wish I could say that things returned to normal. Anders was himself when he was sober. The man was jolly over whatever progress he saw in his recent batches. His highs, however, went from being the easy parts of the job to the worst. Sober Anders had an occasional bladder incident. Once every two days, maybe. Traveling Anders had no control and would soak the bed or leave a trail of feces as he slid over the sheets. He soaked my cast once while I changed him. I made a special trip to get it re-wrapped. When I got back, the stench of sweat and stale piss was overwhelming.

Despite his secrecy regarding the ingredients, he was more open than ever about his experiences. Something had changed for him. He skipped down the stairs and helped me to sweep. I was snaking his hair out of the shower drain when he told me about the moon.

“I can’t believe that scientists have labeled it a barren rock,” he said, “There is life, enough to maintain a complex biodiversity, all in that vast array of invisible colors. If only Armstrong had eyes to see them. Science might be decades ahead. Centuries, even.”

I ripped through a chunk of hair pulling out the drain snake. It was rank from a vomiting incident earlier that day and I was in a bad mood from cleaning it. Anders looked at me working with shame.

“I’m sorry for that. What happens to my body while I’m here is just as important as what happens to me there. Thank you for taking care of her.”

“Her?” I asked.

He realized his error. These days I know it wasn’t a simple trip of the tongue. He made an excuse out of washing the bed sheets while I finished in the bathroom.

It was getting hard to watch him lose his handle on things. Twice he forgot me and fell into a panic attack. It was only when I threatened to quit, shaking my resignation letter in his face, that he let me in on it. He spoke without taking a breath, like he was happy to no longer bear the burden alone.

“I have a way out,” he said, ”and I intend on taking it. I have known what it is to be a soul unfettered. Our real face, my friend, is trapped within this one. The old psychics, in their experiments with astral projection, knew something of this, but they lacked the critical portion. To escape the body in a permanent manner, to escape *death*, requires sacrifice. A body does not relinquish its hold easily. Something must die in my place. In my travels, I have found a replacement.”

I watched his face grow manic with the act of explanation. I told him it didn’t make sense. He needed a cat scan, or more medication, or something. Anders just smiled with all of his teeth and, before he continued, filled his diaper and had to be changed. We continued our talk while he laid back on a rubber sheet and I helped him into something fresher.

“I know the shape of my soul. We are stranger than we think, but stranger still are the beings that live, unnoticed, just beside us. I’ve trained myself on psychedelics, and I knew I was on the right path when I saw them all around us. They are jelly-like things, spirits that have never known a body, and they float about and observe us always,” he said.

I flattened out the rubber sheet and tossed the soiled undergarment into a plastic grocery bag. I applied baby wipes to the unclean areas until they were overflowing from the bag.

“I believe they are, all of them, immortal, and most are near-mindless. Some of them, however, know of ancient secrets. I spoke to them, on the edge of the sea of tranquility, with the great blue Earth watching over us. I met with a collection of silver hands, who I call Nuada, that appeared as an angel before me. I’d agreed to her proposal without hearing it. Our souls aligned. We knew we could help each other. I wished to live as she did. She wished to die as we do. To that end, she has agreed to take my body at the time of death and vanish in my place.”

I moved Anders to a sitting position and he clung to my shoulders while I pulled his sweat pants back on. His body bumped into my wrist hard enough that I had to lay him down again while I waited for the pain to fade. I checked him for bruising while he winced and shook his head.

“I’ll be glad to be free of this,” he admitted,”You’ve been a fine friend, don’t think I will forget that. I was going to address something with you later, but maybe we should talk sooner.”

“Maybe when you’re feeling lucid,” I said.

“I’m lucid now. I want to go to my lawyer. I want to leave everything, from house to meager fortune, to you. I have no one else, besides Nuada, who has no need of any inheritance. All I ask is that you let me continue this work. Even if you think I’m out of my mind, which I know you do, let me succumb to my madness in peace. If I am right, then I shall live forever. If I am wrong, well, I will be dead soon either way.”

There was a moral balancing of the scales that I needed to do. If Anders was speaking from his senility, then I’d never forgive myself for taking his money. If he was serious, then I’d have a free house with enough money to live on. I had him show me his notebook where he’d planned it all out. We saw the lawyer the next day.

As secure as the future seemed, Anders’s periods of drug-induced inactivity were growing. He was once out for a full week and considered it a great success. Beforehand, he bought a feeding tube and gave me some books on how to use it. I lubricated the end as per the instructions, but we didn’t have access to localized pain killers or numbing agents. Instead, we crushed up as much ibuprofen as I thought he could handle and hoped for the best.

He took his cocktail and smoked in the bathroom, like always, and I carried him to his bed. I propped him up into a sitting position with a wedge pillow and made sure he was covered in light sheets so he would not get too warm. He’d already made his way into his tattered old pajamas before leaving for the hidden rings of Jupiter.

On the second day, I went in with his feeding syringe as he looked around the room with unfocused eyes. His fingers were splayed out like he was reaching for something far above. He started a low hum and raised it in pitch and volume as I got closer.

“Anders,” I said with a quick nod.

“Anders,” he repeated back.

I jumped. It wasn’t much, but that was the first time I heard him speak while high. I told him to lay back and get some rest, but he began whining until I gave him my attention. He liked to hear me talk, so I did. Then I ran out of things to talk about, so I grabbed the Alice novels from Anders’s shelf and started reading. He fell asleep that night and by Thursday he was repeating simple words. It was almost wholesome, until that Saturday night.

I was getting him ready for sleep. He sat up in his bed and, as always, had his ice-blue eyes on me. I was looking forward to getting to my own bed before having to take care of him all over again tomorrow. That night he decided to surprise me.

“Goodnight Anders,” I told him, flicking off the light.

From the dark he replied.

“I am not Anders.”

I slammed the door. His stories of wild spirits and soul-trades passed over my mind, but I pushed them away. This is what I was being paid to handle. That was all

Startled by the door, he whined through the night. His throat was red and raw in the morning. A welt stuck out from the back of his head where, I assume, he’d hit it against the headboard. I applied a baggie of ice while I read to him. He repeated after me like normal until Anders came back to me around noon on Monday. The glassy stares were replaced by a sort of hung-over look that, while exhausted, at least focused on things other than me. We pulled the wet tube from his nostril and I held a glass of water to his lips while he drank.

“Help me lay down,” he said. I lowered him onto his usual downy pillows and set the wedge aside for washing. 

He lost his voice for three days and refused to leave his bed for that time. The typical excitement following his adventures was absent. More than that, his hands spasmed and his legs shook like a scared rabbit.

At last he said my name while I worked to balance the household budget. I had my legs tucked under me in his office chair when he startled me with a sharp yelp. I turned to see him try, and fail, to stand on his own. We got him back into bed in one slow lift. 

“I’m tired. My body doesn’t listen to me anymore. In my mind I am young and limber. Here I feel trapped in this cage. I need to be free of it. You’re still young, but I hope you will understand me when I say that my next excursion must be my last.”

I was quiet for a few minutes before answering. On one hand, I’d seen how quick he was when he was sober and lucid. Even while I was changing the man’s diapers he’d pull my phone out of his ear like a reappearing quarter. Call me simple minded, but it was funny, and he thought so too. Anders was most himself when he was laughing.

On the other hand, he wasn’t always lucid. By then he’d forgotten me five times and the terror was getting hard for his heart to bear. I had to take his cane away and that left him bedridden. Now he might take a twenty minute shuffle to the study if he were feeling adventurous. 

I told him, “I think you’re going to ask me to do something that I don’t want to do.” 

“It's already planned out,” he said, “in my notebook on the bedside table. Just read it and follow it closely.”

“I don’t know if it’s your time yet. There’s really nothing left here for you?”

“It isn’t my time, and that’s why it has to be now. If I get any worse I might forget how to leave. Last time I traveled, it was like I wasn’t tethered anymore. I was halfway to Tau Ceti when this body pulled me back.”

I took his black notebook and peeked through his plan. It filled the front and back of the last page in tiny script and read like furniture instructions. Things like, “Place concoction A into feeding tube on morning of second day. Take tablet C and allow to dissolve in water until cloudy, then give to patient at dusk of fourth day.” The last step read: Dispose of remains in any way deemed fit.

“It has to be soon,” he insisted, “Nuada is as anxious for results as I am. You’ve been caring for her so well.”

“How long will it take?” I asked.

“It took me three days to escape my usual restrictions. We’ll allow a fourth, to ensure I’ve broken the chain, and a brief tolerance break beforehand will further guarantee the effectiveness of the drugs. On the fourth day, if you follow my instructions, all three of us will be free of our burdens.”

We shook hands on it. During my last days with him, he kept the secret shoebox on his bed so that he could grind, drip, and peel all of his materials. He put everything I needed in bright orange pill bottles. Each had a sticker labeling them with their corresponding letter. I knew one of those bottles would kill him, but it just looked like typical pills, tablets, and drugs. Nothing new.

I held the pipe for him on what was, according to him, his last night on Earth. I wiped a spot of dribble from his chin and let him take a hit. He coughed out the first, but he held the second until I was worried he might never exhale again. The whole time he had the old showman’s glint in his eye. He grinned as he released the smoke in one long, slow, breath. I helped him force down a bitter pill and we spoke while we waited for everything to take effect.

“I’ll be sure to write,” he told me.

“Only if it isn’t too much trouble,” I said.

“I’ll be immortal. What trouble can there be?”

“Goodbye, Anders.”

“So long for now.”

I watched the old Anders fade from his eyes as sleep took hold of him. I ensured his feeding tube was secure, and cleared the bed of his materials. The notebook told me what to do from there.

The first morning and afternoon, at least, were textbook. Anders was sedated and spent the whole time in bed against his wedge pillow. Twice he spat up, but I was ready to clean him. I followed the notebook instructions and gave him a leg injection during his first feeding. I even had enough time to wonder if I was doing the right thing.

I’d taken my watcher’s position at his desk and did my best to pass the time. I found a blank section in his notebook and started planning out the rest of my life. Best case scenario, I’d go back to school and never work unless I wanted to. I realized it was getting dark and turned around to see if he’d fallen asleep. He was sitting straight up. His eyes were on me again.

“Hey, Anders,” I said.

“I am not Anders.”

I’d been wondering if I’d hear that again. 

So I asked him, “Who are you?”

Anders lifted his arms to the sky and twisted his hands around each other in a variety of odd patterns. In doing so he caught his finger on the feeding tube and yanked hard on his nostril. A few inches of plastic tubing came out with it and he screamed. I held his flailing arms down and fed the tube back where it belonged.

I tried reading to him again. The noise softened to a quiet whine, but didn’t stop. We’d made it to Through the Looking Glass and I would have read all through the night if Anders hadn’t started ripping the pages out partway through the Walrus and the Carpenter. I was so surprised by his reaction that I’ll always remember where we left off.

“It seems a shame,' the Walrus said, ‘To play them such a trick. After we've brought them out so far, and made them trot so quick!”

His usual placid expression was gone and replaced by furrowed brows and twisted lips. He rambled random words between bouts of screaming, and kept it up even as the clock rolled past four in the morning.

We were still awake when the first rays of the second day came around. I took the pill bottle labeled “A” from the desk and found a medicinal gray sludge inside. It burned my nose like rubbing alcohol. I was halfway through making breakfast when I realized that Anders had stopped screaming. In fact, I went back and found him smiling. A spot of drool leaked down his chin.

The pill bottles were missing.

After checking the floor and tearing out the drawers, I found the C bottle beneath Anders’s bed. The notebooks said that the A bottle must be used with his first feeding. Anders had not moved an inch since the night before. The ruffles in the sheets were in the same position.

I spotted his hand move beneath the sheet and pulled it aside. Again he started screaming, but I caught him white-knuckling the B bottle. I dug my fingernails into his skin to get it back. The contents, many rattling pink capsules, seemed untouched.

Putting Anders on his side revealed nothing but a small bed sore on his back. It was after I’d given up, fifteen minutes past the latest I’d ever fed him, that I went back into the kitchen and found bottle A in the silverware drawer. Anders was making a clicking sound in his throat when I returned. It was better than screaming, but it felt more directed. I think he was laughing at me.

I had to hold him down with one hand to feed him. He was agitated with the feeding tube and tried over and over again to pull it out. It wasn’t easy to tie his arms down. I got a white rope from the shed. tied one of his wrists, slid the rest under the bed, and brought it up again to tie the other arm. From there he was stuck in a crucifixion pose while his legs thrashed and kicked at me. I had to tie those too.

Despite all my new precautions, he managed to twist his tongue around the feeding tube and bite through it. I shoved my hand into his throat and got fat, blue bruises along my knuckles while fishing it out again.

Day three called for an injection, which I thought would be easy with him tied up, but I had to pin his arm down with my knees in order to inject him. He leaned his head against me when it was done. We were both crying.

On the last morning, I woke up in a puddle of sweat with an empty stomach. I’d forgotten to eat or wash myself with everything going on and decided to risk a quick rinse. The shower was just warming up when I noticed how quiet it was. I pulled my rank clothes back on, now damp from the steam, and went to check. I didn’t even bother turning the water off.

Anders was gone.

It took a moment for my brain to realize what I was seeing. At first it was just strange. There was dark blood on the sheets where his right wrist rested the night before. The ropes were missing.

Panic kicked in when I heard rapid footsteps downstairs. A slam followed, and the crack of shattered glass got me sprinting. I found the downstairs study in a terrible state. One of the bookshelves was on its side and the window behind it was smashed open. Fresh blood dripped from its jagged edges. I spotted Anders running, arms swinging like mad, down the bright morning road. A swollen rope-burn dripped blood from his right wrist. Glass cuts poured thin lines of blood down his face. The two ropes trailed behind him.

I opened the window and followed him in long, slow steps. I called his name. He turned towards me with a hateful glare. I grabbed the end of the rope tied to his ankle. His lips curled back into a simian grin.

I told him, “We need to take you back inside, Anders.”

The rope went taut as he sprinted for the bushes outside his neighbor’s house. He screamed as loud as he ever had and my attention was split between him and the neighbor’s windows. Nobody came to look. His twisted fingers tried to fiddle with the rope. When they failed, he bent over and began to gnaw at it. His gums were bloody. 

I yanked my end, trying to get it out of his mouth, but I must have used more umph than I meant to. Something in his leg snapped. There was no more screaming after that.

I lifted him, doing my best not to strain his injured leg, and took him inside. I laid him on the overstuffed lounger by the broken window. I got his pills from upstairs and filled a cup of water in the kitchen. The instructions said to wait until dusk, but that was still hours away. Anders was in pain now.

Getting him to drink was the easiest thing I’d done in days. At first he turned his head away, but I lifted the fizzing water to my lips and pretended to take a sip. Comforted by my little trick, he drank. He looked so tired. I picked something random from the shelf, a chemistry textbook I think, and read to him until his body spasmed and he coughed up yellow foam. I held his hand. He grasped mine and stared up at me with pleading eyes while his lips moved with the words he could no longer say. They were easy to make out.	“I don’t want to die.”

Then he was gone.

I’ll spare you the clean-up details. It was easier than anything that came before it. I buried him deep in the backyard. Nobody came looking for him. No neighbors reported me for dragging him back into the house, kicking and screaming. I even reported his death to the newspaper and got an obituary printed. Maybe I was tempting fate. I thought someone might even come to debate the will. Nobody did. I think I wanted some cousin or nephew to pop out of the woodwork and prove that Anders had once lived. Even if it was just plain greed, it would be something.

I couldn’t sell the house without someone, one day, deciding to install a pool or do foundation work and come across him. I’m living there now. I’ve had the floors re-done and modernized it with ring cameras at every door and televisions in every room. The painters did a great job on the walls and I spent months replacing the furniture. Still, I don’t spend much time in the downstairs living space.

That’s about the end of it, but I’ve not been sleeping well. I get nightmares, almost always the same, almost every night. I’m on the moon, with Earth like a massive dome on the horizon behind me. I’m surrounded by ultraviolet creatures that float about in gelatinous rings. I see Anders, but he looks about as human as the common cold, and he is thanking me without words. He says he can make me like him. He says he knows the way. All it takes is sacrifice. 

But I wake up. I make myself coffee and get showered. Somewhere between pulling on my socks and lacing up my boots I forget about Anders and get on with my day.",2,1729360611.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1g7emmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/1g7emmp/my_narc_and_his_apologists_are_everywhere_i_feel/,My Narc and his apologists are EVERYWHERE. I feel trapped. ,"[Advice Request] I (29F) left my narc (33M) after 3 years of his abuse a nearly 2 years ago. In that time, good things have happened- I met my now-husband, we married not long ago, and he’s been pretty supportive and patient as I continue to recover from Matthew (fake name). 

However, Matthew and his friends seem to be everywhere we live. We live in the “artsy” part of town, where husband has lived for 10 years, me for 7. Our city otherwise is dull, and I wouldn’t live anywhere else here- I liked my neighborhood until I got involved with him. Matthew works at the most popular coffee shop in town, so he knows almost everyone in our neighborhood and a lot beyond. A lot of these friends of his also work at virtually every restaurant, bar, coffee shop, local shop, grocery store, and haunt I once loved in my area as well. 

Unbeknownst to me when I met him, Matthew was an abusive narc to several women before me, some of which I’ve gotten to know. Obviously if I knew, I wouldn’t have gone near him. That being said, these friends of his have been aware of his actions for years. I’ve cut some of these mutual friends off who I opened up to about Matthew and they’ve chosen to continue to hang out with him. Some of these friends of his, who were never nice to me, were friends with my husband before he met me, whom he’s since cut off. 

Additionally, Matthew was recently “me too’d” by another ex online which detailed a lot of painfully familiar behaviors and abuse. Some of his friends went out of their way to defend him. Like always, Matthew never faced any consequences for this, and I’m beginning to accept he never will. I do not want to detail exactly what he did to me or others at risk of triggering people on here but we could say some of these things are criminal. 

I feel like I can’t go anywhere anymore without running into one of these people. Matthew made me the subject of a smear campaign our entire relationship- I thought it was just after break ups, but I was wrong, and found out the entire time we were together, he spread horrible rumors about me and said I was an abuser based on how I reacted (“reactionary abuse”) to how he treated/lied to me constantly and said I was an “obsessive stalker he only hooked up with once.” 
While I KNOW what really happened, I’ve grounded myself in knowing my experiences and feelings were valid, I’m in a loving place with a wonderful partner now, I can’t seemingly can’t shake this reputation. Also, to cope with this abuse, there was honestly a point where I did go out and drink a lot- which didn’t help that either (proud to say I only drink once a month now).

While I do have some level of support around here, many of my best friends have moved away. I talk to my husband, therapist, and long-distance friends most of the time. But I miss feeling like I could go out and enjoy myself still. To make things worse, I wanted to go to our local coffee shop (not Matthew’s, this one is closer to us) after garnering some strength, only to find out Matthew’s new girlfriend/victim works there. I froze and couldn’t go in. Also, yes, she knows about him being “me too’d” and doesn’t believe he could ever do that, of course. 

I feel like I’ve been robbed of enjoying the neighborhood I’ve once loved and thrived in. Time does not seem to heal this. I’m wondering if seeing these people everywhere is hindering a kinder recovery or if I’m just not allowing myself to fully face reality. What should I do? Just puff out my chest and brave through it like I’ve never known him? Or give up and move away (husband is open to moving)?

Edited to add: I have not seen Matthew since I left him, miraculously, but a lot of that has been due to extreme caution and avoidance, which I don’t like. ",1,1729360605.0,LifeAfterNarcissism,1,1.0,False

I'm seeking information on groups or organizations doing exceptional work to support people. This could include initiatives combating social isolation, offering education or digital skills training, providing general support, running food programs, or hosting coffee mornings. Organizations that support vulnerable groups or programmes that offer things for people with disabilities etc

I work for an organization that may be able to fund some of these groups to help them continue their valuable work. We're also interested in directing our customers to these resources.

While I'm interested in activities across the city, I'm particularly keen to learn about initiatives in Wavertree, Huyton, Dovecot, Kensington, and Toxteth. Additionally, if you have ideas for projects addressing these needs but require funding, please reach out—I'd love to discuss them.

1g7ekwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1g7ekwf/botox_after_review_of_first_appointment/,Botox - After Review of First Appointment ,"Hey all you lovely people! I feel like there are many posts on here about Botox, and many questions regarding it. I know I was searching fanatically earlier this week. I just had my first injection yesterday and I felt like doing a review of how it went, especially as someone who was very hesitant and does not like needles. 

So about a month ago my doctor finally convinced me to give Botox a try. She has said multiple times that we are running out of treatment options for me, as most preventative medication has little to no effect. I’m currently on topomax which somewhat maybe does something but I can’t take a regular amount as it just dopes me up too much. I’m also on egality and ubrelvy. Ubrelvy works for me as a rescue most of the time. I would say 75% but I often have to take two 100 mg tablets to get it to work. Egality is iffy. It did the first time I was on it, but once again, I don’t like needles and had a panic attack during an injection once which resulted in hives on my neck. So I stopped for several years then started again. This time I’ve been on it for about 2 years and it’s meh. My husband has to administer it after I panic for 20 mins about the shot. 

I got the call this Tuesday that they got it approved through my insurance and scheduled me for Friday. My doctor prescribed me an anxiety med and my husband took me. I woke up with a migraine that I’d had for three days. I took the ubrelvy and anxiety pill that morning. I did start to panic a bit when I got to my appointment, but the anxiety pill helped for sure. My doctor is really sweet, and got the whole producer done in under five minutes! I believe it was around 40 shots, I kept my eyes closed so I didn’t have to see it. Some of the shots hurt a little and some of them I almost couldn’t feel. 

The amazing part is the shots actually broke my migraine. I had a light headache (maybe a 3) afterwards but I went in at a 7. Some of the injection site stung a bit afterwards, and I believe that’s what was causing the headache after. I did find the “rules” a bit hard to follow as the first thing you want to do is touch the areas. And I usually take evening showers so that was hard! I did worry about accidentally moving the injection site at times, but I don’t think I did. I did have a stiff neck yesterday but it wasn’t anything bad and that went away in my sleep. I overslept today so my head did hurt a bit but after stretching and coffee I was fine! I have a bit of “tightness” where the injection sites are, and I’ve been told that’s normal for a week or so after. I still have a dull headache at times but it seems to just be related to me moving my neck and shoulders, as long as I keep stretching it seems fine!

Overall, after day one, I would say it’s not as scary as I was led to believe it was. Especially as someone was does not like needles. I did not have any negative side effects afterwards either. So far, I am hopeful that it will help in the long term. I hope this story helps someone else!",2,1729360472.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

1g7ek6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/redflagsTA/comments/1g7ek6y/butterflies_bladders_and_bad_vibes/,"Butterflies, bladders and bad vibes","Hi all 😁 

I have been watching Red Flag for quite a while, and I thought maybe I should submit my stories. This happened to me in university, and it still haunts me. P.S. I did replace some of the context and didn't add anything untrue. 

At the start of my university days, I was friends with Gerald in this story. So, I am introverted and find it hard to meet new people, especially in a class setting. Another classmate, Jennifer, pulled me into a group, and soon, we all became friends and often sat together in class. I wasn't very friendly to Gerald at first because I had my own traumatic experience of being sexually harassed by a co-worker when I was working at my intern company; I always put a gap between myself and any guys I met at first, and that's what I did with Gerald too. 

One day, Gerald texted me about our assignments, and it was fine at first; there was nothing wrong with asking a classmate about assignments. We started talking more about our commitments outside of classes, and gradually, we became more friendly with each other. Once, when we were close to our submission date, I told him I was stressed out because I didn't understand the topic well enough to write my report. He asked me where I lived and suggested a nearby cafe for a cup of coffee. Ngl, this sent me some butterflies tingling in my stomach. So I quickly dressed up (just a little) and waited for his car below my apartment. When he reached, and I got into his car, I saw him in a different light. He is goofy and lies a lot to joke around people. But at that time, I saw him as a mature and emphatic person who was about to bring me to get a cup of coffee… And I was so wrong about it…

Everything was fine; coffee was fine. He was on his way, sending me home after getting a cup of coffee. He received a call from his sibling telling him to go to the main house immediately as their parents were having a massive fight because the dad found out the mom saw someone behind him. (for context: he is pretty rich, born with a silver spoon) 

I unintentionally overheard his conversation when I was in his car, and before I left, I told him if he needed someone to talk to that, I could listen. He said thanks and left.

Later that day, around 10 p.m., he asked if he could call me about our assignments. I said, ""Yeah, sure."" Maybe he just needed someone to talk to after what he had gone through at home. He did call me about the assignment, but he refused to put down the call, and I asked if he wanted to talk about what happened at home. He started talking, and it went on for hours with him pouring out and me consoling him. When I told him I was sorry, I needed to sleep; it was close to 3 am. A friend is having a hard day; I guess it is fine compared to if he tries to do anything silly to off himself, hence why the call lasted for 5 hours that day. After that, he requested me not to let anyone in class know about his situation, and I thought, yeah, it is not my business to talk about such personal stuff anyway. I agreed. 

I regret agreeing. 

After that day, Bro called me almost every day for hours after a long day at class and a part-time job. At first, I was scared that maybe he just needed someone to talk to, and if I didn't, he might off himself, so I chatted with him. One day, during one of the calls, I wasn’t feeling great because I had a lot on my plate and was very tired. So I talked for an hour and put down his call, and he called again; however, this time, when I picked up, he said oh, you picked up and gave me a minute. 

I started to hear a zipping sound, and I didn't react to anything until I heard water streaming. It sounded like someone had turned on the tap and let the water run in a tiny stream. IT TURNS OUT HE WAS DOING HIS BUSINESS, URINATING ON THE OTHER LINE. I freaked out, but I also think it might have been because he forgot to mute his line. After he came back to the phone, I told him that he had forgotten to mute his line. He told me he didn’t intend to mute at all; I am his friend, and it is okay for me to hear it. I freaked out and said I am a girl; I don't feel comfortable talking to my girl friends on the toilet, let alone hearing someone doing their business on the other line. 

He said it was fine, and I let it go until he DID IT AGAIN on another call another day. He laughed about it, and I threatened that I would not pick up any of his calls if he always planned to urinate when he was on call with me. He agreed this time, and I thought at least it would come to an end. Oh, I was so wrong. 


Later, he shared with me that he met this gorgeous girl in a bar, and they had a fling with each other. He likes and wants to pursue her but unwillingly puts down the situationship between them. He started to ask me what girls would like, etc, and what girls like a guy to do. It is okay to ask, but my problem is that I have never gone on a date before. I have no experience of what I would like if a guy did. Plus, I felt it was personal; what every girl likes differs. He said it was fine, so give him an answer, in my opinion. 

However, he asked peculiar questions like:
1. That girl sucking his ear loops when they are making out. Should he do that back? Would she like it? 
2. They were dry-humping each other with clothes on when they were on an escalator. He can feel her chest because she is not wearing any. Should he tell her that he likes it, etc?

I cut him off soon after and even blocked his number because I was having anxiety breakdowns and crying about how a friend was treating me. I was disgusted by his actions and words. However, this action didn't do any good to me, and words spread out in class. This situation led to another classmate, Jennifer (who wasn't on good terms with Gerald in any way), who mistook me for things because I couldn't tell her what was happening. Also, she mentioned before that she didn't want to know anything about Gerald. She went around crying to other classmates about how I “bullied” her for not talking to her (yes, all of them are in university). Soon, I had become the bad guy in my university period, and no one wanted to talk to me or group with me for university projects; I thought of dropping out/ postponing my studies to the next semester because I really could not handle the stress of how I was trying to help a friend and become the villain in the end. 

Honestly, until today, I still don't know if I did anything wrong, like if it was my fault for not sharing what I have been through and I lose all my classmates (sorry but I can't see them as friends). My point in sharing my story on red flags is also to give myself closure, and I am glad I graduated without postponing my studies or continuing keeping the butterflies in my stomach. It is time to let go of this encounter. 😁",1,1729360413.0,redflagsTA,0,0.99,False

Obviously this was emotional news. We had to drive to the appointment separately so before we left we were standing in the parking spot between our 2 vehicles hugging. 

At this time, a nurse pulls up wanting to park in the spot. There were easily 100 other spots in the lot including spots right on the other side of the one she insisted on parking in. She turned on her blinker and my husband walked up to her window and said, ""Really? Move on."" Of course she didn't. We both got in our vehicles. She came up to my window and told me to control my husband. I said I was just told our pregnancy might not be viable and to get out of my face. She kept running her mouth. 

My husband saw and came over. He got out of his vehicle and said she needed to leave me alone. She started going off on him. She said I don't have time for you two cuddling in the parking lot. So I got out of my car and shoved her. She said, ""You messed with the wrong bitch."" I threw a water on her car and left.

She proceeded to follow my husband and threw her coffee at his truck. He stopped and asked her why she was following him. She said she was following him to wherever he was going. He said he was going 2 hours away and she didn't want to go where he was going so go ahead. She stopped following him. 

Today, my husband got a call from a blocked number. It was her boyfriend threatening to beat him. My husband did not engage and just let him go off. 

I have a toddler at home, while I might not be soon I'm pregnant right now and vulnerable. I cannot think of how she would have gotten his number. I am wondering if she was able to figure out who I was because she must work in the office I had just visited for my ultrasound. 

Anyway, wondering what you would do in this situation? I thought about reporting to police or my OB but I don't know her name or plate. The incident occurred in St. Louis as well so I don't think anything would be done. 

I will have my husband accompany me to future OB visits and he will be strapped. We also have a lot of guns at the house. But the whole situation is scary and bizarre and honestly feels unreal. ",2,1729360355.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Eureka Mignon Manuale not grinding fine

Hi all, I’m very new to espresso making. I just got a {Eureka Mignon Manuale} and {Breville Bambino Plus}. Since I’m new, I may not know how espresso grind is supposed to look but no matter what grind setting I use (between 0-5) it looks like the grind size is the same—somewhat coarse. I’m not sure how to solve this outside of getting a new dial like some past posts have suggested. Also, I should say once a week or so I use the grinder to grind beans for regular coffee. 

Also, I don’t really know what this whole 16 grams in 32 grams out at 30 sec or whatever means. Is that referring to how much espresso liquid comes out of the espresso maker and how long it takes? What does that matter?

Seriously, it's like my first spiritual experience in life. I'm on my way to heaven. I hear angel choirs sing, peace doves fly around me, the sun is shining out of my ass.

I don't do fasting to lose a lot of weight, I'm in the normal range, so I don't find fasting for a lot longer feasible. I know 5 days is rookie numbers compared to a lot of you.  

It worked well this time, in fact I had no problem to persevere at all after I needed to break other trials prematurely due to, well, appetite. I only had mild discomfort in the stomach/guts and I was quite tired. During the fast I learned that apple cider vinegar would not influence autophagy, so I tried it and I don't know if it's coincidential, but it seemed to help against the tiredness.  
But mentally, not eating at all, not giving into the craves was ridiciously easy this time. I guess being keto for 8 weeks helped a lot, and taking elektrolytes as well.  

So I was proudly following my break-fast-plan starting yesterday and, holy mother in christ, I did not imagine the sheer bless of eating fairly basic staples after being abstintent for this bit.  

___

Yesterday evening: drank a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in glass of water as preparation and after that, solemnly sat down with 180ml of bone broth with an added teaspoon of butter.  
The sheer godliness smell shocked me. The first sip of this holy concoction shattered me. How was this taste even possible?  
I needed one hour to down the broth, and this was by no means out of cautiousness or any rational reasoning in general. I needed some time after every sip to comprehend what my senses delivered. I literally sat there, eyes closed at times, leaned back in my chair, and fucking *moaned*.  
bone broth with butter: 25/10  

The next morning, after my cup of coffee with, finally, heavy cream in it (how badly I missed you!), I ate greek yogurt, 150g, and for this I needed one full hour, too.  
Whereby ""ate"" is a bit of a misnomer. I gave myself maybe a fourth of a teaspoon of yogurt at a time. Repeat the closed eyes and the moaning from before. I just couldn't stop it.   
greek yogurt: 45/10  

Lunch was a bit of a veggie salad with cucumber, tomatoes, avocado and feta cheese and 2 boiled eggs as a side. Rinse and repeat, there was my third culinary orgasm in a row. How can this stuff tastes *this* amount of ""best ever""?   
veggie salat with eggs: 65/10  

___

I'm feeling full to the brim right now and maybe will not eat again today, I'm fully content, because I'm in heaven.  
I thought I would repeat the fast maybe 3-4 times a year just to give my stomach a bit of rest and snatch some of that holy autophagy, but after *this* experience I'm inclined to try again a lot sooner, simply out of the impression of this intense, other-worldly sensation during my first meals. I even might've been able to eat some, urgh, *brussel sprouts*.  

'Tis all I have. To the ones currently fasting: keep it up, I belive in you. To the ones in the state of breaking the fast: hope everything goes well and that you can snatch some of this culinary miracle. I might go out and start missionary work.",2,1729360102.0,fasting,1,0.75,False

**FAQs**

# How far can walkie talkies really go?

This is probably the most common question people have, and the answer depends on a few factors like terrain, weather, and obstacles. Most walkie talkies list a max range (like 35 miles), but that's under *perfect conditions*. In reality, expect something like 2-5 miles in most situations—unless you’re on a mountaintop with zero obstructions.

# What’s the difference between FRS and GMRS walkie talkies?

FRS (Family Radio Service) and GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service) are two types of walkie talkies. FRS models are lower power and don’t require a license to use. GMRS models are higher power and often need a license from the FCC to legally operate. If you need more range and power, go GMRS—but keep in mind, you’ll need that license.

# Can I use walkie talkies for business purposes?

Yep, walkie talkies are often used for business, especially in construction, events, and security. You’ll probably want ones with more channels and privacy codes, and depending on the distance and environment, you might need something with more power (GMRS) for better coverage.

# Do walkie talkies work through walls?

Walkie talkies can work through walls, but the signal weakens depending on what the walls are made of. Thin walls like in a house? No problem. Thick concrete or metal walls? That’ll cut the range significantly.

# Can I use my walkie talkie with someone else’s brand?

Yes! As long as both walkie talkies are on the same channel and use the same type of communication (FRS or GMRS), they’ll work together. Just make sure you’re both tuned to the same frequency and, if possible, using the same privacy codes to avoid interference.

We have a tip jar and there was some random change and a dollar in there from the first couple customers of the day. It’s clearly a tip jar—it currently has a Halloween-themed drawing on it, along with “Thanks for the tip!” written quite large. 

This guy comes up and he orders a drink. I forget what it was, but the total was $8.05. He was paying with cash, had the $8, and was digging around for the change. I was about to be nice and say, “Don’t worry about the five cents!” because it’s five cents, as long as my drawer isn’t under multiple dollars it doesn’t really matter. 

But before I can say that, this guy reaches INTO THE TIP JAR to grab a nickel from it. I told him he couldn’t do that because that was our tip jar, and he DID apologize, to his credit. But the damage was done, that 5 cents was getting paid. He ended up just giving me an additional dollar to cover the rest (the five cents). 

Pretty much any time someone wants to pay with exact cash and can’t find the remaining .05-.10 cents I’ll just wave it off, especially if they’re also being friendly. But bro, to try and steal from the tip jar of the person making your coffee? Especially when they’re clearly the only person working and doing everything? Even if it’s a freakin’ nickel… Nope. No favors for you, sir. Even for five cents. ",2,1729360021.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

In the before times, Saturdays were either a total lost cause (rot in bed all day or keep right on drinking and delay the pain--then doubled--until Sunday).

Woke up this morning feeling great, threw on a pot of fancy coffee that I now enjoy investing in. Threw in my air pods, popped on an episode of the Sober Powered podcast while I organized some out of season clothes and got a nice big pile ready for donation-- which I then took right over. 

After that, I hit up the grocery store. Wasn't really in the mood, but didn't want to put it off either. These days, I enjoy wandering around a bit more looking for fun/novelty items....That's when I saw it. A mix for Red Lobster's Cheddar Bay Biscuits. I was immediately transported back to my childhood when going out to eat felt like such a fancy, exciting experience. A time when many of us were able to feel pure joy before we even knew what alcohol was. I couldn't help myself. About to pop my tray of nostalgia into the oven & settle onto the couch with my husband & pup to enjoy this relaxing Saturday with some cheddar biscuits and horror movies. 👻

THIS is the kind of random, ""chaos"" that I love these days. I wouldn't be coming up on 10 months without this amazing community. Big hugs to you all & I will not f***ing drink with you today! 🤘",2,1729359826.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

I just bought some beans from a coffee roaster.

The coffee looks very lightly roasted and was happy to have found some. The varietal is stated the process the roast date and region too. There was no information about the farm though. Anyhow I came home and smelled the beans to encounter a rather dark roast smell which caught me off guard. I was wondering if it may have to do with the roaster they use, primarily for dark roasts and it not being thoroughly cleaned after each roast making the oils of the darker ones stick to the light roasts giving them that slightly unpleasant smell. I have not tried the coffee yet but had that theory in mind and was hoping to be able to discuss about it and to have an idea if the coffee will be fruity and delicious or dark and chocolatey which I dislike.

I was scrolling through Twitter (or X now—Elon Musk, what a guy), thinking about how nice it would be to have more than just my mom, best friend, and that one spam bot following me.

I'm M, 41, Asian, 6 feet tall, 158 pounds. Been weight training for the past 20 months. Prior to weight training, I was very skinny and have been all of my life. Lifting is the only exercise I do these days.

My diet - high protein, very little sugar, no processed foods, avoid refined carbs (except rice), no moderation with fats (because I have been told that I need about 200 more calories daily so that I can perform better in the gym).

I eat 6 whole eggs everyday (flash fried, with lots of Extra virgin olive oil about 2 tablespoons), coffee (black), white jasmine rice (love rice), chicken, meats (typically steak), protein shake (raw oats, PB fit powder, banana/blueberries), protein bar (will only do either one shake or one protein bar/day) avocados, roasted vegetables, pasta, chipotle bowls.

I am lactose intolerant. Fairlife lactose free doesn't work. I get eczema when I consume too much dairy.

I take one tablespoon each of psyllium husk and chia seeds everyday, first thing upon waking up, to combat eczema and watery bowel movements.

I take vitamins daily.

Mother has history of cholesterol issues I think.

I have a shellfish allergy, which I found out about in 2009. I still ate it for a few years after thinking I was okay eating one or two cocktail shrimp. I realized over time I would get nauseated and have panic attacks after I would do that. (I then reflected on other times I felt that way, which often led back to shrimp...but I digress). I last had a known reaction in 2019, when I had an airborne reaction at a seafood restaurant.  I was sitting next to two people cracking open lobsters. I got stuffy (should have been my first clue) and a few hours later had gastro symptoms. My doc was like, oh, yeah, you maybe should start carrying an Epipen just in case your reactions get even worse.

I ended up having an airborne reaction yesterday. I had a mild reaction following a student (I think - it could have been staff or faculty, but they have another space of their own) microwaving shrimp in the main hallway.  There's nowhere to walk but through there to get to classrooms and my office. My throat ended up getting scratchy and itchy after a bit and I started to cough. I ended up leaving and popped a Benedryl (I know, I know, Benedryl is no longer the first line of attack with reactions, but it's my first go-to. I use the chewable or liquid kind).   This helped my throat, but I later had some mild stomach symptoms and felt awful the rest of the day. Still feel off today.

I am trying to decide what to do. I am not one to police what people eat, but feel like I need to go to HR and have shellfish banned from being cooked in areas like this. I don't think I realized how much shellfish can be airborne, as far as the proteins, when cooked. I did a lot of reading yesterday, lol. I'm fine if people are near me and eat it (as long as it doesn't need to be cracked open or it's not being cooked in front of me).

I feel so weird about making a fuss, but I also didn't know my reaction would be this way from spending less than a minute or two walking through the area. It really scared me. I don't like being ""special"" and requesting ""special"" accommodations. I am afraid to be laughed off. I doubt that will happen, but I just don't want people to roll their eyes over it. :(

But what would have happened if I hadn't left? Would I have had to end up using my epi-pen and being taken to the ER? I am afraid the answer is yes. ",2,1729358338.0,FoodAllergies,3,1.0,False

Where to order? ,"Way back when, my dad and I would often get tea together at this cute little café that specialized in tea. My father and I only officially met and started spending time together when I was about 19, but we became close. We'd sit there for hours and get refill after refill, plan trips abroad that we knew we'd never take, talk about different types of tea, etc. He was a dreamer like me.

My dad unexpectedly passed over a year ago, and the little café shut down a few months later. Before they closed their doors, I purchased some loose leaf pu-erh from them. I just had some today because I kind of forgot about it and largely stopped drinking tea in favour of coffee over the years. 

As soon as I tasted it and smelled it, it brought me back to those days with my dad. I want to start drinking tea again. However, I don't know where to get tea now that the little shop is closed. The grocery stores here just have the basics.

I miss superior gyokuru (sp?), milk oolong, etc. Teavana and David's Tea seem to concentrate mostly on fruity and sweet blends. I like just straight up tea or tea with florals. 

Does anyone know where I could order tea online in Canada? I'm going to save up a little money. With the cost of living now, I can't afford to splurge too much on rare teas, so a place that's fairly priced would be appreciated.

Formatting is a bit weird, and I'm genuinely all over the place while writing this, and sorry for the length, but to paint the whole picture, some contex is required. 
 
I 19(F) has an elder brother 23(M), and to say that he's a problematic person is an understatement. 
 
We've been going through financial crises ever since my father's diagnosis of his heart conditions, the pandemic, and then his sudden death. 
 
We've been managing to scrape by somehow with my mom 49(F) and my brother working full time. 
My dad left a large sum of loans and debts, most of which we didn't have to pay because of his death except the bike's loan they got for my brother when he turned 18. 
 
My brother forced mom to pay the EMI by emotionally blackmailing her by saying how it's dad's ""last gift"" to him and shit
Like that 

We barely paid the bike loan, but then he somehow got credit cards opened in his name and racked up debts after debts as his precious bike had some issues and shit, and he kept getting it repaired again and again. 

Now we are in 4L debt because of him, and he still continues to spend like he's rich, jokes about how he leads a royal life, but in real life his bank account is often 0 or in (-). 

He forced my mom to take loans to pay his credit cards and convinced us both that he'd never use the cards again but refused to close them down. Once she took the loan and he paid everything up, he then spent it all again and put her in debt. 

The majority of the house's income goes into paying those loans, and some part of it goes into my fees as I'm in a first-year degree program.

 Today we're at the point we can't even afford basic necessities and are scrapping by, and then my brother opened some e-wallet in her name by emotionally manipulating her by saying that money will be set aside for my 2nd semester fees, which we have to pay before November 15th; otherwise, my admission would be considered cancelled. 

She agreed, and it gave her some 13k. We withdrew some of it for the basic necessities and groceries, but 11k was still in there. But today he called her and stated that one of the guys he has borrowed money from to pay up the credit cards is now asking for a payment of ₹13,000, so he's withdrawing it. 

He was screaming at her, abusing her, and whatnot, and took opt from her and withdrew the money to pay that guy. 

Then my mom came to me screaming how he's a moster just like my dad, and I don't have the best relationship with my mom, but when she put his calls on speaker and he was abusing her with such cruelty, I was shocked. 

And the moment I asked mom to stop screaming and let me hear him, he went quiet, and when he started talking to me, I asked him not to use that tone with me. I'm not our mother; I'll not put up with this tone. 

He said that what can I even do, and I hung up. I'm shocked and writing this in the other room, having an anxiety attack while mom and brother are having a screaming match over how both of them are failures. 

Him mocking her call center job, saying there's no growth. Her saying at least she brings the money in gives it all to him to pay his debts and doesn't even spend a single rupee on her, and how he's a monster. 

Now one thing is, my mom watches a lot of serials, and she only uses those serial's dramatic dialogues. And then they both start screaming again at each other. I don't have a great relationship with her, but I don't think this is how she should be treated; she's the reason why he flaunts those fancy coffees on his stories. 

She's screaming about how she cooks, cleans his clothes, and literally hand-feeds him, where he just lays in bed whenever he's home and orders everyone around as if it's some patriarchal situation where we are beneath us. 

Im not able to write every time down here, but he curses at us and screams at us. Whenever no one agrees to his ideology, he throws his phone or whatever he gets at us. He has hit me three times, but the last time he did it, I took a screwdriver and launched at him so he doesn't dare to hit me again. He has hit mom as well when he was 17-19. He has hit dad once when he didn't listen to him, as he has always been raised as a golden child. 

Now he's an alcoholic monster who thinks he's the richest, smartest guy out there, and just when I thought things were calming down, but then my brother sent me a call recording of his and mom's call. In that she was agreeing to him and gave him the OTP, and he was not screaming at all. 

I'm shocked, and I don't know who to believe. I'm exhausted. These things happen every day. 

Each day I wake up and try to focus as much as I can on my studies and other activities, but these people throw a new cruve ball at me. 

They've made me a middleman. He doesn't pick up the call, so she nags me continuously to call him and shit ask things and shit

Beyond its delicious aroma and rich flavor, here are some health benefits backed by scientific research:

· **Boosts Physical Performance**: The caffeine in coffee can increase adrenaline levels, enhancing physical performance.

· **Aids Fat Burning**: Studies suggest that caffeine can boost metabolic rates and aid fat burning.

· **Rich in Essential Nutrients**: Coffee contains essential nutrients like riboflavin, pantothenic acid, manganese, potassium, and niacin.

· **Lowers Risk of Type 2 Diabetes**: Regular coffee drinkers may have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

· **Protects Your Brain**: Consuming coffee is linked to a reduced risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

· **Fights Depression**: Some research indicates that coffee could help reduce the risk of depression, especially in women.

· **May Reduce Cancer Risk**: Coffee drinkers have shown a lower risk of certain types of cancer, such as liver and colorectal cancer.

But it's not just about health benefits; coffee has a rich cultural and social significance. It's a ritual for many, a moment of solace or a shared experience.

Here's a thought—how has coffee impacted your daily routine, and have you noticed any health benefits or drawbacks? For me, it's the perfect start to my day, both energizing and calming.

I’m also curious about your brewing methods. Do you lean towards a French press, espresso, or something else entirely? How do you think different methods affect flavor and caffeine levels?

Let's not forget the environmental aspect. Coffee production can have a significant environmental impact. Have you found ways to support sustainable practices in your coffee consumption? Any local initiatives or brands you admire?

My first year of college I had a pretty intense crush on a guy in my dorm. During that time I had trouble not thinking about him constantly.

Between fall and spring semesters I managed to butt dial him over social media (snapchat) when he wasn’t even someone recent or high up in my messages list 

A few years later he would show up on a dating app (hinge) in his senior / my junior year of college. His 3 prompts were the same as mine, same question exact same answers. For all 3 prompts. I deleted the app that afternoon because I didnt want him to think I changed my answers to be like his because they weren’t similar they were exactly the same.

That same junior year another guy who had stuck out to me a bit on a dating app (bumble) but it never really went anywhere, one instance I run into him directly one night at my off campus apartment. MY campus is pretty big so it can be weird running into each other late at night in an apartment off campus but that’s not the big one. I decided to text some unsaved numbers in my phone and he happened to be one of them. I went through texting them out of pure boredom (and loneliness) one night (maybe I was trying to find an old sneaky link I really dont know) Apparently we had spoken a little earlier in the semester before matching on bumble about possibly living in a house together the next year. This was weird because I didn’t like him like him. But after matching he had been in my brain for a few days. Doesn’t happen with everyone. 


Finally this past summer I got into a situation where I liked a guy I was hooking up with and he wasn’t really feeling the same. I moved two a different city for a summer job opportunity and knew I would only be there for a few months.. at this point it had been some time that I hadn’t been anxious or depressed. He did like me at some point ands he admitted this but i believe he felt I was too soon in asking to see him more often. He lost interest or got scared but He didnt tell me this outright and  instead told me someone in his family had passed and he would be out of town. I didnt know wether to believe this to be true because on one hadn’t telling someone who likes u that this awful thing happened to you seems like it would just make them continue to be concerned for you. On another hand people can be messed up. When the day came to move out of my summer apartment and drive back to my home state, I had taken much longer to pack up my things, I also stopped to get coffee and then had to pull over again to write an emergency email in the car. After writing that email I turned onto the next block and as I was driving down this block I looked over and he was walking up the block. Throughout the whole summer of living less then 10 blocks away from him and hoping I’d run into himI see him by chance right as im about to leave. 

Now I move back to my college for my 5th year to find that a boy I had started having a little crush on last semester is best friends with my random roommate and now I see him constantly. Theres there’s 5 major off campus apartment complexes near my campus so for his best friend to be my direct roommate is crazy as I was just experiencing my first crush in a while on this guy. We spoke a little over instagram dm over something school related but I was too nervous to do any more then say hi in person. 

A few more things about me, I dont subscribe to the matrix or simulation theory simply because thinking about it would add more stress to my life. I grew up christian but have a complicated relationship with religion but I do believe in god I just dont know what I truly believe about him. I would love to hear your take. Obviously these are more centered around relationships but I notice strange happenings in my life in other areas. There was a time, I had been 11 or so out at a Christmas party with my mother when I was hit with my first ever feeling of impending doom or anxiety. I asked my mom to go home and upon arrival had found that a sick family member had passed which led me to believe he passed at the same moment I was filled with what I didnt know at the time was some form of dread. 

I have like others had substantial exisitial crisis’ at times. But really I think I just want your takes on it all. Sometimes I wonder if these are like a form of torture. Ive recently been asking myself is god just laughing at me. Is my life some movie that people are laughing at on the other side lol. Or is there a way to look at these in the positive, is it a form of protection or am I being shown that maybe I should’ve ended up with these people and for one reason or another it didnt work but it wasn’t something I did to make it go wrong?.. Just someone lost looking for a little guidance. ",4,1729357566.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I am a newish puzzler, at least to the puzzling world, and have been lurking here admiring and upvoting all of your wonderful puzzles. I've combed through the FAQs and gotten all sorts of information. I just wanted to introduce myself and tell you how much I appreciate all of the information you've all collected here! 

I'm Diana, I've only recently started putting together physical puzzles, rather than jigsaw apps on my tablet. Up until this point in my life I haven't had space or time! 

My husband and I bought an older house in Amish Country and found ourselves with extra wall space to decorate. Americana Puzzles seem like the perfect way to go. Not only do you get the joy of putting it together but then you can look at it on the wall.

After we broke our backs leaning over the coffee table to start this dowdle puzzle, we decided to spring for a standalone puzzle table. Boy this thing is neat! I've got a cheapo ring light clamped onto it and it's got felted drawers for sorting which is awesome. I finally feel like a real puzzler! LOL 

Anyway, here's my progress and pictures of my newly acquired puzzle stash. The country ones will end up on the walls and I'm not sure about the sheep, yarn ,and teacups yet. My other hobbies include fiber arts (knitting, spinning, and weaving), fountain pens, perfume, and tea... So I'll be on the lookout for puzzles with those themes.

I did have a couple questions. How many of you puzzle with others? And how do you handle the puzzle dust?",1,1729357525.0,Jigsawpuzzles,2,0.67,False
1g7dfpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_kitchen/comments/1g7dfpk/why_coffee_is_more_than_just_a_morning_boost/,Why Coffee is More Than Just a Morning Boost ☕,"I've been exploring the fascinating world of coffee, and I've found some intriguing insights that I think you'll appreciate. Whether it's the health perks or the cultural significance, there's so much more to coffee than just a quick energy boost.

**Health Benefits** 

Did you know that coffee consumption has been linked to numerous health benefits? Studies suggest it may reduce the risk of certain diseases, improve focus, and even enhance your mood. Are there specific health benefits you've noticed or any drawbacks?

**Social & Cultural Significance** 

Coffee isn't just about the drink—it's a social experience. From cafes being hubs of creativity to coffee ceremonies in different cultures, there's a rich tapestry here. How do you think coffee's cultural significance varies globally? Does it affect your view of this beloved beverage?

**Brewing Methods** 

The way you brew can drastically change the flavor and caffeine content. From French press to espresso, each method brings something unique to the table. Which brewing method do you prefer, and why? Have you experimented for health or taste reasons?

**Environmental Impact** 

Coffee production can have significant environmental implications, but sustainable practices are on the rise. How can we support these initiatives? Have you discovered any local products or movements making a difference?

**Personal Experiences** 

I find that coffee tells a story in everyone's life. What's your most memorable coffee experience, and what made it special?

Lastly, has any research changed the way you view coffee? I'd love to hear about any surprising findings or personal discoveries you've made.

Looking forward to hearing your stories and insights! Let's keep the conversation brewing.

**The Future of Coffee** 

As coffee culture continues to evolve, technology and innovation play an increasingly crucial role. We're seeing advancements like smart coffee makers, which allow for programmable brewing settings, and apps that connect coffee lovers to exclusive blends and subscription services. Moreover, the rise of plant-based alternatives and zero-waste packaging is reshaping the way we consume coffee. What future trends do you think will emerge, and how will they transform our coffee experiences? How do you feel about the integration of technology in your daily coffee routine?

**Community Engagement** 

Coffee has a unique way of bringing people together. Whether online or in-person, coffee communities are fostering connections and sparking conversations worldwide. How do you engage with coffee communities, and what value do they add to your coffee journey? Have you attended any local coffee events or meetups? Share your experiences and recommendations, and let's keep exploring the incredible world of coffee together!

**Sustainable Coffee Movement** 

 

The sustainable coffee movement is gaining momentum as consumers and producers become more environmentally conscious. This movement focuses on ethical sourcing, fair trade practices, and eco-friendly farming techniques that prioritize the health of our planet.

Are you aware of any coffee brands that adhere to these principles? Supporting these initiatives can make a significant impact on reducing the industry's carbon footprint. 

How do you incorporate sustainability into your coffee habits, and what tips can you offer to others who want to do the same? Whether it's choosing beans from local roasters or supporting biodiversity-friendly farming practices, every effort counts. Let's discuss how we can all help drive sustainability in the coffee industry forward.

**Conclusion** 

Coffee is much more than just a beverage; it's a complex web of culture, health benefits, personal stories, and environmental considerations. 

As we've explored, the journey of coffee—from its rich history to the exciting advancements on the horizon—reveals why it holds such a special place in so many lives. 

By appreciating its diverse impact and committing to sustainable practices, we can enjoy coffee not only as a daily ritual but as a meaningful part of our global community. 

What remains clear is that coffee's role in our lives is constantly evolving, and it continues to foster a sense of connection and innovation. As we move forward, let's embrace all that coffee offers and remain conscious of its journey from bean to cup.

First he wrote about 7-8 pm. At the day of the party he sent us message about 8 pm. He wrote it in a group chat and there were many messages this day. Unfortunately I didn’t notice the second one…

I went to his flat at 7:30 pm. He was really mad / irritated about me being early. I checked messages and understood my mistake. I apologised to him but he was still mad. 

I gave him a plant with a pot, because it was my first visit in his new place (it’s quite normal tradition in Poland). He took it and didn’t say anything.

I felt like sh*t. I told him once again that I’m really sorry and I really didn’t notice his second message. Didn’t matter. Still mad / irritated and  said again that he told us to come at 8 pm.

That’s when I got a bit irritated. I know I fucked up but you don’t have to treat me like that. I told him that if it’s such a problem I can go for a walk. He said that if I want I can stay. 

The atmosphere was quite tense / weird so I left. I just sat outside on a nearby park bench. Meanwhile he wrote to me “Oh so you got the hump / Oh why are you so offended” (I’m trying to translate from polish). 

I responded that I just matched his energy. Then he said that if I will be coming back I can buy some baking paper on my way. 

I didn’t respond. I cried for a while and messaged my bf. I had heavy dark makeup so it was quite visible. 

He (friend) tried to call me and messaged where am I and if I will come. I responded that It didn’t seem like that’s what he prefers. He told me to get over it and that he prefers it.

I went back home.

I know it was not nice of me to come too early but at the same time I feel like I wouldn’t treat someone this way. I think the “normal” thing would being a bit irritated but not to the extent of shaming your guest.

Additional context: We study nursing in Poland. I’m 21 F, my classmate 31 M. Few months ago, when we were in different groups / classes, he invited me for a coffee. I told him that I’m in long term relationship but we can get to know each other in non romantic way. He agreed and we met few times. ",2,1729357258.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

I live alone in a 3 bedroom house near a ski area. My cousin and his wife came out years ago to ski and stayed with me. I had to drive them everywhere as they didn’t rent a car. I’ve stayed with them 2 times going back home and am always one and don’t expect them to cook or anything for me. 

Fast forward 15 years later and he is married with 2 kids. Last year they came out to ski bringing all four of them out. As I get older I want my peace and don’t want to entertain guests. They bought me a cheap coffee maker as I don’t drink coffee so they would be able to make coffee when they are there and left it as my house. Now every year they want to bring the whole family to stay in my house so they can ski. They both make really good money at least 6 figures each where as I only have one income. When they come out I am more stressed and am a little annoyed that they seem to think that since they bought me a coffee maker that they can expect to come out every year. 

It annoys me that with 2 incomes that they have to mooch off my place and are too cheap to just get a hotel.

As I get older I am more in a routine. I also get my own hotel nowadays rather than stay in someone else’s house as I don’t want them to drop whatever they are doing to host me. I also work 12 hour shifts so I want to come home to an empty house. Should I feel annoyed that they are being cheap as with a family of 4 who has 2 six figure incomes coming in that they should just get a hotel? I didn’t choose to have kids so I feel they shouldn’t impose on me and my peace. If I was in their shoes I would feel bad about imposing on someone else’s peace especially if I was a family of 4.

How do I approach this?","I (35M) have known, lets call her Star (27F) for about 5 years, and she’s been in a long-term relationship for 7 years. I’m shy and reserved, but I’m pretty popular at school, especially with the girls (Only saying to explain the situation). From the first week of school, Star showed interest in me, even though she had a boyfriend. Over the years, she consistently made efforts to be around me—inviting me to group study sessions, parties that she hosted, hanging out in the library where I often go, and finding other ways to connect with me. She also, seemingly, started distancing herself from her boyfriend—deleting his pictures from Instagram. These constant efforts made me like her and eventually fall for her.

At one point, we were meeting at our internship regularly and I was texting her regularly and we even made plans to grab ‘coffee’ at her place, but I didn’t end up going due to personal reasons. This and other interference from my ex who is in the same class as us, meeting up became harder coz she doesn’t want anyone to find out.

When I couldn’t see her a lot I resorted to texting and she asked me to stop as she didn’t want any traceable evidence and preferred to talk in person instead. I didn’t listen and kept messaging her, which led her to file a formal complaint with the faculty. The complaint was tough on me because although it didn’t, it had the potential to affect my career. I don’t think her intention was to harm me, but the complaint still felt like an overreaction compared to what I did.

After this complaint, I built an emotional wall against her and became very cold with her and tried to take my mind off of the situation by talking with my ex. Now I noticed she started trying even harder to be around me, although not too obviously. She has also moved out of her boyfriends place but they are still together

- Even though Star shows interest, the fact that she’s still with her boyfriend leaves me questioning her intentions. If she’s pursuing me while being with him, how can I be sure she wont do the same thing to me?

- If my texts were enough of a threat for her to file a complaint, why continue pursuing a high risk relationship at all?

**Trust and Moving Forward:**  
I’m unsure if I should forgive her, or not, especially given how disproportionate her reaction was.

I want to talk things out and clear the air, maybe find closure, but I’m afraid of being vulnerable and getting hurt again and I have no I idea how to be mature about this and face her.

**TL;DR:**

I (35M) have known Star (27F) for 5 years. Despite being in a long-term relationship, she’s shown interest in me, which made me fall for her. After I kept texting her despite her request to stop, she filed a complaint, which felt like an overreaction. Now, she’s trying to be around me more, but I’m unsure if I can trust her since she’s still with her boyfriend.

I’m shy and reserved, but I’m pretty popular at school, especially with the girls (Only saying to explain the situation). From the first week of school, Star showed interest in me, even though she had a boyfriend. Over the years, she consistently made efforts to be around me—inviting me to group study sessions, parties that she hosted, hanging out in the library where I often go, and finding other ways to connect with me. She also, seemingly, started distancing herself from her boyfriend—deleting his pictures from Instagram. These constant efforts made me like her and eventually fall for her.

At one point, we were meeting at our internship regularly and I was texting her regularly and we even made plans to grab ‘coffee’ at her place, but I didn’t end up going due to personal reasons. This and other interference from my ex who is in the same class as us, meeting up became harder coz she doesn’t want anyone to find out.

When I couldn’t see her a lot I resorted to texting and she asked me to stop as she didn’t want any traceable evidence and preferred to talk in person instead. I didn’t listen and kept messaging her, which led her to file a formal complaint with the faculty. The complaint was tough on me because although it didn’t, it had the potential to affect my career. I don’t think her intention was to harm me, but the complaint still felt like an overreaction compared to what I did.

After this complaint, I built an emotional wall against her and became very cold with her and tried to take my mind off of the situation by talking with my ex. Now I noticed she started trying even harder to be around me, although not too obviously. She has also moved out of her boyfriends place but they are still together

1g7d221,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1g7d221/fearful_avoidant/,Fearful Avoidant?,"**Asking for advice, insight on what's happening- anything you got.**

**Alright, buckle up:**

**My backstory:** I (27f) am anxiously attached and have been working on secure attachment for over a year now through therapy and lots of self-awareness. I have had experiences with dismissive avoidants in the past and my therapist believes this is also partially due to my mom wounds.

In January, I hesitantly entered a relationship after a DA discard in August and finally thought it was time to try dating again. We dated until July and he's not a bad guy, but he was pretty abusive and manipulative in the relationship 2 weeks in. He ended up breaking up with me on a 4th of July trip in a cabin with his friends 3 hrs away because I didn't toast him a bagel and I made one for myself. We had been talking about breaking up for months and at that point, I think we both knew there was no going back. I had processed it enough.

**Then came along Jake** (29M). I met him in March at the coffee shop I worked at when he came in one day and exclaimed that I had beautiful eyes. He took me aback because he was my dream guy (yes I was in a relationship at this time and yes i felt guilty but it wasn't a good relationship.) He began asking my friends about me and they told him i was in a relationship. We worked right by each other and had mutual coworkers, but didn't see each other after that.

The day after my ex and I officially split (after trying to work things out for a week), Jake and I reconnected. **It felt like a dream.** I was hanging out with some friends at the bar his food truck was in and he's typically a loner, but he came out to say hi and in our first \*real\* conversation, we ended up talking for hours. I told him I was getting out of a relationship and he seemed sad but understood. I saw him two days later and AGAIN, we talked for 4+ hours.. This time, we both were hooked.

**He asked me on a date a few days later** and we stayed up until 8am just talking and walking around the city. We eventually made it to my house and did nothing but hold hands. I told him he could stay over because he lives far and when we woke up in the morning, we had our first kiss and our first time having s3x. (I lost my virginity to my ex earlier this year, so he was my second.)

**We were attached at the hip.** I was hesitant at first because he would come into my work and kiss me very publicly, kiss me in the middle of my sentences, interrupt me to tell me how lovely and beautiful I was, and tell me how safe he felt with me. After being in an abusive relationship, this felt like an absolute dream. I was scared, but silly me thought to trust him. He has a good home life (dad in the military, fairly busy) and he seemed to have a good head on his shoulders.. and our chemistry was unlike anything else.

**Jake's Backstory:** He had gotten out of a 4 year relationship the year before. They both moved to our state together and he has described their relationship as very push-pull. She was avoidant and always upset with him from the start, wanting to keep her side of the relationship open but always accused him of cheating, though he's very monogamous. He was avoidant, too, but he avoidance made him anxious. They just flipped roles a ton. They went to couples therapy and tried what they could. He hasn't taken much blame other than saying they were a mismatch and lost feelings. I will say, he had just gotten out of a relationship with his ROOMMATE and had sex with her while him and his most recent ex were casually dating. This was because she dumped him after 6 months and he still had feelings. 

**He tried to remain friends with his most recent ex** when she moved back to their home state and she cut the relationship off completely in March, telling him to stop contacting her because she was in a relationship. They had hooked up once since their official break last October. He has a pattern of wanting to be friends with ex's.

**Now back to Jake and I**: He was sweet and kind and everything I had ever dreamed. He would play me soul music in the mornings, went to culinary school (he's had a million jobs) and would make me delicious meals, we would listen to music in the car for hours, we had so much fun together and loved so many of the same things. We became exclusive almost immediately and I had noticed he had communication issues and he had mentioned them in the past, but I blamed this on his unmedicated ADHD and I have grown secure enough to be willing to work with him on this. He was very clear that he didnt want to be uncommunicative in relationships going forward.

**I told him I wanted to start slow**. I was getting out of a relationship and I was the one who was.a little more avoidant in the beginning. He seemed obsessed with me. And after a few weeks of that consistently, I trusted him.

**Once i was all in, he was distant.** He is absolutely obsessed with trail running (i mean OBSESSED. trying to make a career out of modeling in it) so he blamed busyness with that... and yes, i knew he was busy so i was patient. After all, things had been perfect. Eventually, it became a ""i will try to fit you in once or twice this week"" .. which is fine, but the affection, the compliments, the everything just STOPPED. i was emotionally and physically lovebombed and then it all was gone.

Again, I know I'm anxious so i tried not to act on my anxiety. I also knew his ADHD probably played part. I eventually did need to ask for reassurance because i was confused and saw the good ole push-pull pattern that i am used to. He would shut down and not respond and then later come back with a response that was SO reassuring that i was fooled. It made me think i was overthinking it all and he really was just an overly laid back guy with ADHD. He'd apologize and say hed work on being better at communicating. Communication was AWFUL at this point. (very inconsistent, all about his schedule, mostly about him, mostly about running.. only really about running)

**I began to mentally compare myself to his ex.** He had all of these beautiful photos and captions posted about her on his page (he doesn't care much for his phone or social media and when we'd talk about her, he seemed so sure that he was completely over the relationship and moves on quickly from people, so i wasn't worried). and the way he was with me in the beginning seemed to be consistently how he was with her.. but she treated him horribly, and he eventually said he was just trying to overcompensate and make things work.. but it bothered me. It bothered me that she was always upset with him and never showed him affection and I had been patient and caring and kept trying to show affection, but was given nothing. And he was like this with his other ex's too, though they had broken up with him. and his other ex's? He said he lost feelings or had forgotten about them basically. a pattern. i never brought this up, but I didn't understand why he didn't do anything he had in the beginnning.

**I spent months in anxiety**, confusion, and trying everything to get him to want to be emotionally connected again. Because that was lost. But he always reassured me, was still VERY physically affectionate (though not in public anymore. Again, when i started to show it back he stepped back), and mainly just when we were having s3x. But he would say things that made me think i was still just overthinking it all. He would breadcrumb enough to keep me around.

**Fast forward to 3 weeks ago:** To sum up this painfully long post, my intuition when he started to pull away was right. I think he may be a fearful avoidant. We had the best weekend and then he went on a 10 day running trip. He was so distant while he was gone, but this wasnt anything  i wasnt used to at this point, and he would post on Instagram without checking in (which is fine to an extent). He'd respond to me in the morning and then send a message right before bed, but was online all throughout the day and said he didnt do much throughout the days. I sent a text asking if he could just sends a heads up if he didnt want to talk that day (i tried to make it v sweet and not accusatory bc i know that's a trigger) and he ignored me all night. I sent another text apologizing and blaming my anxious attachment -- this was the biggest spiral i had gone into lol i really try not to show it to him. and then he responded in the morning with a text kind of brushing it over, apologizing, saying it wasnt a big expectation and he understood, and then a million other texts about running.

**But the communication got worse. So i stopped asking and tried accepting.**

**He came home**, spent a few days with me, had amazing s3x, dogsat for my friend, had a lovely time.. We went to a lovely piano concert and i noticed he was super distant during it but afterwards he held my hand the entire way home then played me the piano until I fell asleep.

**Now here's the breakup:**

**I went to Boston for a trip right after and he picked me up from the airport.** Things were great. I was so excited to see him and he was starting to seem affectionate again. I stayed the night with him but at night, I noticed he didnt want to kiss me or anything. We usually were very sweet and intimate.

The next morning, he took me to a diner and when we got back to his house, the DTR conversation came up. (We had a conversation the month prior about him being too busy for a relationship because he wanted to give me his \*all\*. But he wanted to prioritize running. He knew I wanted more after he had withdrawn but he was insistent on us still dating but figuring out our schedules, so we were in an exclusive relationship but didnt have the label for god knows what.. Though in the end, he said we were absolutely in a relationship?)

**He looked at me straight in the eyes and said ""I just want to be friends"".** I was in shock. Yes, he had been distant but he also kept showing me that he cared in other ways and I thought maybe it was just his ADHD causing him to love-bomb at first. 

He told me that he didnt see me romantically and there was no possibility of him seeing me romantically. He lost feelings and didn't have a desire to make our relationship grow. He told me he just didnt desire me and that he no longer wanted to make me a priority in his life.. he also kept going back and forth between saying that i was the ""only person he's lost interest in like this"" and ""this is a pattern and he doesn't know why he does it"". ??????



 He told me about his other relationships and how they left him out fo nowhere (he has this belief that people always leave, which we talked about in the beginning), and how he wanted to try with them. How his other relationships were very push pull and with me, he just didnt have a desire to make things work like he did in his other relationships.

ouch.



he told me i had done nothing wrong and had only been supportive and loving from the start. he said he didnt lose any attraction for me and that he has so much fun with me. that there was no one else, that he couldn't even date right now if he tried. but he simply didnt see me romantically and still wanted friendship with me. he said he had been contemplating this before his trip and was wondering why he didnt desire me, but didnt have any answers.. he said he just felt disconnected and didn't know why. 

He was INSISTENT on being friends and having me in his life, doing all of the same things that we had before like talking about life, going to concerts, etc, but not as frequently. He doesn't want to lose me as a friend.

I'm absolutely devastated. he seemed like he didnt care other than just feeling guilt (though he said he cared and has been told he's robotic before bc he's so logical at the end of relationships). He wants to meet up next week though he said he isn't going to change his mind, but he wants me to change my mind about being friends.

i want him in my life more than anything, but I'm so heartbroken. i cant sleep, eat, or think half the time. Im so confused.. He said he used to be able to see a future with me and now he cant. That we're a ""mismatch"" and ""incompatible"" but he cant give me any answers as to why.

he said he doesn't know, he just feels it.

My therapist said to reach out Monday and set a time to meet though i want to reach out now. I just don't know what to do about this whole friendship thing or really any of it. It was only four months, but I think I may have loved him. I know a friendship isn't the best option, but I also dont really move on well with no-contact. it kind of has always sent me into an even greater spiral.

Im just sad and confused.

Diagnosed stage 3C TNBC at 26. 
AC is really kicking my ass. I just got through 12 weeks of Carbo/Taxol and it went fine. Mainly just some fatigue on days 2-3.
The moment I left the infusion center the AC started beating me up. Nausea, trouble swallowing, feeling hungover/dizzy when I close my eyes. No bone pain, but I’ve been taking Claritin every morning to try to prevent it. For nausea, I’m on Ondansetron, and Compazine, but I still feel nauseous. I find that I have nausea triggers. I can’t think about chemo, I can’t touch my head (I do cold capping and so i think my brain associates it with chemo), coffee is a no-go. Im so emotional. Im also on chemopause, and the hot flashes are wiping me OUT. My oncologist prescribed something called Vyosa, which I cant take because insurance doesn’t cover it and it’s $680 dollars. I do take lexapro which is surprisingly supposed to help with them. I did get a dose dense of keytruda as well as my first AC, and im like praying that the harshness of the effects are due to the combination of the keytruda. 

I honestly don’t know how im going to do 3 more of these.

Hey everyone! 😊

Over the past few months, I’ve been working on Hously Insights ([houslyinsights.ca](http://houslyinsights.ca)), a passion project I started for fun on the side to create an all-in-one platform for real estate tools. I found myself using various calculators often and thought, why not build a single place for them?

After many learning experiences and late nights, the site now offers tools like mortgage calculators, land transfer tax estimators, and more. While some tools are currently Ontario-based, I’m working hard to expand with province-specific tools across Canada! 🏡 It’s still early stages, but there’s much more to come!

No signup required, It’s all free. 🎉

I know there are a lot of other sites out there, but I wanted to create a less clunky, all-in-one solution that's also mobile-responsive. I’m working on this solo without much experience, so it would be great to know if these tools are useful or need improvement. Your feedback would mean a lot as I keep improving them! 🥳

1g7cven,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1g7cven/question_about_espresso_pods/,Question about espresso pods ,"I have the Vertuo plus and normally drink coffee daily but love having a latte with oatmilk on the weekends. I have tried a few of the nespresso pods but can’t seem to find the perfect one and was wondering if anyone had recommendations. Soon I’m adding oat milk and ice ( no sugar or flavors) I want a pod that is on the stronger side but not without that smoky undertone I feel Scuro has. I love the Dolce but prefer it when using two pods because the coffee flavor tends to get lost under oatmilk. 

I also just tried the new unforgettable but honestly it’s pretty forgettable to me… 

So does anyone have any recommendations for pods? Also, would I be better off getting the original model? Do those espresso pods tend to give off stronger flavors than the vertuo?

Breaking down the story. Today I went to a coffee shop, lots of people around hanging, since its a popular coffee shop in my country (Cyprus). I dated this girl for 7 months that was from New Zealand it was a long distance thing we had going on. She had a specific tattoo that was, leafs wrapped around her right arm. Anyway, I turned around in the coffee shop to get a good look at the people and I see the spit image of my ex situationship, same hair and colour, same face features, same body figure and even the same type of tattoo on her right arm! I was stunned that I thought it was her at first and then after staring for about 15 seconds, I realised it was not her since the only difference between them was the eye colour and the girl i dated had blue eyes and the other girl had hazel eyes. Plus, I heard the girl speak Greek with what looked like  her family. It just stunned me and gave me a bit of anxiety but it went away slowly. Anyway I even told my cousin at the coffee shop to take a look and asked her if they look alike with my ex and she said ""Wow the only difference is the eyes"". I couldn't stop staring at the girl. Me and her made eye contact multiple times. Kept observing her. The tattoo was identical. Their face was so similar, it was crazy to me, to the point where i felt my ex was her. I haven't spoken to my ex, since I went no contact for 5 months now. I was betrayed by her when I caught her lying, being deceitful, trying to gaslight and manipulate me about cheating basically, so I left her. I don't know it just seemed crazy to me how identical they looked and since im still hurting from the experience it just seemed shocking to me. I don't know if someone experienced something similar? If it has more of a spiritual meaning or if its just a coincidence.. Thank you for reading this if you did please reply if you got any type of opinion on it!

1g7cqqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1g7cqqc/delonghi_dinaica_plus_leaks/,Delonghi Dinaica Plus leaks,"So I just bought this 370.95.t second hand, and it’s leaking. I’m been trying to clean it and otherwise fix it up, and have discovered a bunch of leaking symptoms, but unfortunately a heavy hand just snapped a small bit and need to replace that before testing continues. 

When descaling it, I’d flood the drip tray after it. Water came out the water spout and both the coffee spouts. 

Then I did rinses (about 5), and the tray would flood after about 2 rinses. Water came out of the coffee spouts but not the water spout. 

I ran a few espresso cycles, and some coffee came out, but I could also see some coffee-looking liquid on the facade just below the control panel, on the right side of it. 

From some probably incorrect research, it suggests that the rinse should come out of the water spout too, and the reason for the difference may be the solenoid. Does anyone have any thoughts there?

Then regarding the leak behind the control panel, I was investigating it before I snapped a hose connection. Everything seemed normal in there, but I don’t know. 

I have dismantled the coffee nozzle section and fully cleaned it. It wasn’t really dirty in the first place though, so I don’t expect that was what was causing the issues. 

Could both problems be caused by the solenoid? Or what are peoples’ opinions please?

I went from 200 to around my weight right now cutting at 2100 calories but my weight loss has really slowed down so I made the decision to drop my calories to 1800. Now that I'm on a much stricter calorie deficit, I realize I need to make some modifications to my daily eating habits so I'm less hungry and hopefully feel more full? 

  
Breakfast:

-Two hardboiled eggs and two pieces of multigrain toast; toast is 220 (12g protein) and eggs are 150

-Coffee (50 cals from skim milk and one tsp of brown sugar)

  
Lunch:

-Either canned chicken or tuna (from Costco), so around 190-210 calories and 40-50g of protein

-Another two pieces of toast (220 calories, 12g protein)

-Light mayo (60 calories)

-2 Coffees (100 cals) (One during lunch and one at like 3)

  
Dinner:

-Frozen chicken cutlet (260 calories, 25g of protein)

-100g of pasta (357 cals)

-Half a cup of sauce (60 cals)

  
I have about 100 calories left with this plan that I might use on like a low calorie fudge bar for a sweet tooth, etc.

Is there a wine (retail and wine bar) culture in the area?



I am assuming the region is bike friendly given the lack of cars?



I am sure this is a ridiculous question, but you can actually have a car in the area?



Finally, google maps tells me it is a 2 hour public transport commute to the Incheon International Airport. Given its location, this can't be correct? Is there Uber or similar that can get us to the airport and what is the time?

I’ve been dealing with addictions over the past few years and I’ve recently come to terms with them, as I was heavily in denial. “Only do it on the weekends, I’m not addicted, etc.” 

My friends and I have always partied together, but we do genuinely do daytime things like go for coffee, thrifting, etc. They are users but don’t believe they have problems of their own with it, probably because it’s been so normalized recently amongst people our age and it’s a “night time activity”. Same story I used to tell myself. 

When I met my boyfriend (we’re almost at our 1 year anniversary), he and I partied. We quit after a month into our relationship, and I was sober for a good few months. Started up again, lied and said I wasn’t. My friends knew I was lying and would justify my use along with me. I told him about it because I couldn’t hide anything from him any longer and I wanted an honest relationship. 

I’ve had these friends for a few years now and consider them my best friends. He wants me to completely cut them off in order to stay sober and remain in a healthy relationship with him. I feel like I should be able to at least keep in contact and do sober activities with them, as I don’t want to let them go entirely. I’ve been feeling lately as though he is trying to isolate me because they are my best friends. 

AIO or is he totally right and well-meaning? Should I insist that he compromises and accepts that I still want to be friends with them if I stick to my sobriety? Or is that too naive of me? ",1,1729355132.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Fast forward 15 years later and he is married with 2 kids. Last year they came out to ski bringing all four of them out. As I get older I want my peace and don’t want to entertain guests. They bought me a cheap coffee maker as I don’t drink coffee so they would be able to make coffee when they are there and left it as my house. Now every year they want to bring the whole family to stay in my house so they can ski. They both make really good money at least 6 figures each where as I only have one income. When they come out I am more stressed and am a little annoyed that they seem to think that since they bought me a coffee maker that they can expect to come out every year. 

It annoys me that with 2 incomes that they have to mooch off my place and are too cheap to just get a hotel. The last time they came out I made sure they would rent their own car as I don’t have room to drive all 4 of them with their ski gear. 

As I get older I am more in a routine. I also work 12 hour shifts so I want to come home to an empty house.

**Alright, buckle up:**

**My backstory:** I (27f) am anxiously attached and have been working on secure attachment for over a year now through therapy and lots of self-awareness. I have had experiences with dismissive avoidants in the past and my therapist believes this is also partially due to my mom wounds.

In January, I hesitantly entered a relationship after a DA discard in August and finally thought it was time to try dating again. We dated until July and we just weren't compatible other than the fact that we both wanted marriage and loved each others friends and families dearly. He's not a bad guy, but he was pretty abusive and manipulative in the relationship 2 weeks in. He ended up breaking up with me on a 4th of July trip in a cabin with his friends 3 hrs away because I didn't toast him a bagel and I made one for myself. We had been talking about breaking up for months and at that point, I think we both knew there was no going back. I had processed it enough.

**Then came along Jake** (29M) (fake name bc who knows). I met him in March at the coffee shop I worked at when he came in one day and exclaimed that I had beautiful eyes. He took me aback because he was my dream guy (yes I was in a relationship at this time and yes i felt guilty but it wasn't a good relationship.) He began asking my friends about me and they told him i was in a relationship. We worked right by each other and had mutual coworkers, but didn't see each other after that.

The day after my ex and I officially split (after trying to work things out for a week), Jake and I reconnected. **It felt like a dream.** I was hanging out with some friends at the bar his food truck was in and he's typically a loner, but he came out to say hi and in our first \*real\* conversation, we ended up talking for hours. I told him I was getting out of a relationship and he seemed sad but understood. I saw him two days later and AGAIN, we talked for four+ hours.. This time, we both were hooked.

**He asked me on a date a few days later** and we stayed up until 8am just talking and walking around the city. We eventually made it to my house and did nothing but hold hands. I told him he could stay over because he lives kind of far and when we woke up in the morning, we had our first kiss and regretfully out first time having s3x. (I lost my virginity to my ex earlier this year, so he was my second.)

**We were attached at the hip.** I was hesitant at first because he would come into my work and kiss me very publicly, kiss me in the middle of my sentences, interrupt me to tell me how lovely and beautiful I was, and tell me how safe he felt with me. After being in an abusive relationship, this felt like an absolute dream. I was scared, but silly me thought to trust him. He has a good home life (dad in the military, fairly busy) and he seemed to have a good head on his shoulders.. and our chemistry was unlike anything else.

**Jake's Backstory:** He had gotten out of a 4 year relationship the year before. They both moved to our state together and he has described their relationship as very push-pull. She was avoidant and always upset with him from the start, wanting to keep her side of the relationship open but always accused him of cheating, though he's very monogamous. They went to couples therapy and tried what they could. He hasn't taken much blame other than saying they were a mismatch and lost feelings. I will say, he had just gotten out of a relationship with his ROOMMATE and had sex with her while him and his most recent ex were casually dating. This was because she dumped him after 6 months and he still had feelings.

**He tried to remain friends with his most recent ex** when she moved back to their home state and cut the relationship off completely, telling him to stop contacting her because she was in a relationship. They had hooked up once since their official break last October.

**Now back to Jake and I**: He was sweet and kind and everything I had ever dreamed. He would play me soul music in the mornings, was a chef (he's had a million jobs) and would make me delicious meals, we had so much fun together and loved so many of the same things. We became exclusive almost immediately and I had noticed he had communication issues and he had mentioned them in the past, but I blamed this on his unmedicated ADHD and I have grown secure enough to be willing to work with him on this. He was very clear that he didnt want to be uncommunicative in relationships going forward.

**I told him I wanted to start slow**. I was getting out of a relationship and I was the one who was.a little more avoidant in the beginning. He seemed obsessed with me. And after a few weeks of that consistently, I trusted him with my heart. I know its soon, but I do struggle with anxious attachment lol.

**Once i was all in, he was distant.** He is absolutely obsessed with trail running (i mean OBSESSED. trying to make a career out of modeling in it) so he blamed busyness with that... and yes, i knew he was busy so i was patient. After all, things had been perfect. Eventually, it became a ""i will try to fit you in once or twice this week"" and ""sorry I'm just busy"".. which is fine, but the affection, the compliments, the everything just STOPPED. i was emotionally and physically lovebombed and then it all was gone.

Again, I know I'm anxious so i tried not to act on my anxiety. I eventually did need to ask for reassurance because i was confused and saw the good ole push-pull pattern that i am used to. He would shut down and not respond and then later come back with a response that was SO reassuring that i was fooled. It made me think i was overthinking it all and he really was just an overly laid back guy with ADHD. He'd apologize and say hed work on being better at communicating. Communication was AWFUL at this point. (very inconsistent, all about his schedule, mostly about him, mostly about running.. only really about running)

**I began to mentally compare myself to his ex.** He had all of these beautiful photos and captions posted about her on his page (he doesn't care much for his phone or social media and when we'd talk about her, he seemed so sure that he was completely over the relationship and moves on quickly, so i wasn't worried). and the way he was with me in the beginning seemed to be consistently how he was with her.. but she treated him horribly, and he eventually said he was just trying to overcompensate and make things work.. but it bothered me. It bothered me that she was always upset with him and never showed him affection and I had been patient and caring and kept trying to show affection, but was given nothing. And he was like this with his other ex's too, though they had broken up with him. and his other ex's? He said he lost feelings or had forgotten about them basically. a pattern.

**I spent months in anxiety**, confusion, and trying everything to get him to want to be emotionally connected again. Becuase that was lost. But he always reassured me, was still VERY physically affectionate (though not in public anymore. again, when i started to show it back he stepped back), and mainly just when we were having s3x. But he would say things that made me think i was still just overthinking it all. He would breadcrumb enough to keep me around.

**Fast forward to 3 weeks ago:** To sum up this painfully long post, my intuition when he started to pull away was right. I think he may be a fearful avoidant. We had the best weekend and then he went on a 10 day running trip. He was so distant while he was gone, but this wasnt anything i wasnt used to at this point, and he would post on Instagram without checking in (which is fine but he was very blatantly ignoring me lol). He'd respond to me in the morning and then send a message right before bed, but was online all throughout the day and said he didnt do much throughout the days. I sent a text asking if he could just sends a heads up if he didnt want to talk that day (i tried to make it v sweet and not accusatory bc i know that's a trigger) and he ignored me all night. I sent another text apologizing and blaming my anxious attachment -- this was the biggest spiral i had gone into lol i really try not to show it to him. and then he responded in the morning with a text kind of brushing it over, apologizing, saying it wasnt a big expectation and he understood, and then a million other texts about running.

**But the communication got worse. So i stopped asking and tried accepting.**

**He came home**, spent a few days with me, had amazing s3x, dogsat for my friend, had a lovely time.. We went to a lovely piano concert and i noticed he was super distant during it but afterwards he held my hand the entire way home then played me the piano until I fell asleep.

**Now here's the breakup:**

**I went to Boston for a trip right after and he picked me up from the airport.** Things were great. I was so excited to see him and he was starting to seem affectionate again. I stayed the night with him but at night, I noticed he didnt want to kiss me or anything. We usually were very sweet and intimate.

The next morning, he took me to a diner and when we got back to his house, the DTR conversation came up. (We had a conversation the month prior about him being too busy for a relationship because he wanted to give me his \*all\*. He knew I wanted more after he had withdrawn but he was insistent on us still dating but figuring out our schedules, so we were in an exclusive relationship but didnt have the label for god knows what.. Though in the end, he said we were absolutely in a relationship?)

**He looked at me straight in the eyes and said ""I just want to be friends"".** I was in shock. Yes, he had been distant but he also kept showing me that he cared in other ways and I thought maybe it was just his ADHD causing him to love-bomb at first.

He told me that he didnt see me romantically and there was no possibility of him seeing me romantically. He was INSISTENT on being friends and having me in his life, doing all of the same things that we had before like talking about life, going to concerts, etc, but not as frequently. He told me he just didnt desire me and that he no longer wanted to make me a priority in his life.. he also kept going back and forth between saying that i was the ""only person he's lost interest in like this"" and ""this is a pattern and he doesn't know why he does it"". ?????? He told me about his other relationships and how they left him out fo nowhere (he has this belief that people always leave, which we talked about in the beginning), and how he wanted to try with them. How his other relationships were very push pull and with me, he just didnt have a desire to make things work like he did in his other relationships.

ouch.

he told me i had done nothing wrong and had only been supportive and loving from the start. he said he didnt lost any attraction for me and there was no one else, that he couldn't even date right now if he tried. but he simply didnt see me romantically and still wanted friendship with me. he said he had been contemplating this before his trip and was wondering why he didnt desire me, but didnt have any answers.. he really said i was the only person hes done this to other than situationships but i dont believe it.

I'm absolutely devastated. he seemed like he didnt care other than just feeling guilt (though he said he cared and has been told he's robotic before bc he's so logical at the end of relationships). He wants to meet up next week though he said he isn't going to change his mind, but he wants me to change my mind about being friends.

i want him in my life more than anything, but I'm so heartbroken. i cant sleep, eat, or think half the time. Im so confused.. He said he used to be able to see a future with me and now he cant. That we're a ""mismatch"" and ""incompatible"" but he cant give me any answers as to why.

he said he doesn't know, he just feels it.

My therapist said to reach out Monday and set a time to meet though i want to reach out now. I just don't know what to do about this whole friendship thing or really any of it. It was only four months, but I think I may have loved him. I know a friendship isn't the best option, but I also dont really move on well with no-contact. it kind of has always sent me into an even greater spiral.

I want him back more than anything.

**He looked at me straight in the eyes and said ""I just want to be friends"".** I was in shock. Yes, he had been distant but he also kept showing me that he cared in other ways and I thought maybe it was just his ADHD causing him to love-bomb at first. 

He told me that he didnt see me romantically and there was no possibility of him seeing me romantically. He was INSISTENT on being friends and having me in his life, doing all of the same things that we had before like talking about life, going to concerts, etc, but not as frequently. He told me he just didnt desire me and that he no longer wanted to make me a priority in his life.. he also kept going back and forth between saying that i was the ""only person he's lost interest in like this"" and ""this is a pattern and he doesn't know why he does it"". ?????? He told me about his other relationships and how they left him out fo nowhere (he has this belief that people always leave, which we talked about in the beginning), and how he wanted to try with them. How his other relationships were very push pull and with me, he just didnt have a desire to make things work like he did in his other relationships. 

  
ouch.

  
he told me i had done nothing wrong and had only been supportive and loving from the start. he said he didnt lost any attraction for me and there was no one else, that he couldn't even date right now if he tried. but he simply didnt see me romantically and still wanted friendship with me. he said he had been contemplating this before his trip and was wondering why he didnt desire me, but didnt have any answers.. he really said i was the only person hes done this to other than situationships but i dont believe it.

  
I'm absolutely devastated. he seemed like he didnt care other than just feeling guilt (though he said he cared and has been told he's robotic before bc he's so logical at the end of relationships). He wants to meet up next week though he said he isn't going to change his mind, but he wants me to change my mind about being friends.

  
i want him in my life more than anything, but I'm so heartbroken. i cant sleep, eat, or think half the time. Im so confused.. He said he used to be able to see a future with me and now he cant. That we're a ""mismatch"" and ""incompatible"" but he cant give me any answers as to why.

  
he said he doesn't know, he just feels it. 

  
My therapist said to reach out Monday and set a time to meet though i want to reach out now. I just don't know what to do about this whole friendship thing or really any of it. It was only four months, but I think I may have loved him. I know a friendship isn't the best option, but I also dont really move on well with no-contact. it kind of has always sent me into an even greater spiral.

I want him back more than anything.

  
How do you just lose feelings out of nowhere? Was with Avoidance or ADHD? What questions should I ask him when we meet up and what the hell should i do?

I have always worked throughout my teens, through university and beyond in various roles, one of which I enjoyed and could be a successful career for me. However I suffered deeply from depression and I became really quite ill. 
When we decided to buy a house we moved away from my work so together we decided that I should quit the job and focus on my health. This worked well for a while since I set up my own freelance business which meant I could control my hours and take time off whenever I needed it. My husband makes a very decent living and there is no need for a second income.

This worked well for a while since I set up my own freelance business which meant I could control my hours and take time off whenever I needed it. My husband makes a very decent living and there is no need for a second income.

Fast forward to now:
Recently I have been feeling a lot of guilt around not contributing towards our household income. These feelings don’t come from my husband, they’re only in my mind. 
I sometimes wonder whether I should go out and get a job, however we now have an added complication that we are going through IVF so it’s really not the time to be going and getting a new job. 
I still do my freelance work and I also work a couple of days a week at my friends mobile coffee business but I just don’t feel like I contribute enough. My freelance work is very creative and I’ve been finding it difficult recently - with the IVF - to get into a creative mindset so the business has been slow which doesn’t help with my feelings of guilt.

How can I alleviate this guilt I have about not earning a decent wage? I think I am placing my whole self worth on the job I do and the money I earn and I can’t seem to get out of that headspace. Any advice? ",0,1729354440.0,Advice,1,0.5,False

1g7cchd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g7cchd/confusing_work_situation/,Confusing work situation. ,"I work with this girl, she’s actually my supervisor at a school setting and we spent a lot of time talking. It can get pretty flirty. I catch her looking at me in group settings too and she stays late at the end of the day to sit and talk for an extended period of time.

She’s initiated text in a flirty manner once I engaged for a bit and then the next time I saw her at work I suggested we should do some thing and she agrees. When I texted her to set up plans she said she would love to, but was busy for the weekend but we should try again the next weekend or going forward, another time. Next week at work, the flirting behavior continued, long talks, etc. I had to leave to drive a coworker to the train and texted her to see if she wanted to grab some coffee before I headed home from the area. She said she would love that, but she had to see a rush out to meet a client, but any other day she would be down to grab coffee after work.

I’m trying to read this situation because it feels like she’s putting herself out there but every time I ask to do something she’s not available and she hasn’t tried to remake plans with me even though she said that she would like to. I don’t want to be over pursuing. I’ve already asked to meet up twice. Is the game plan here to just stay casual and flirty at work and see when she takes a step forward with her interest level or brings up getting together?

It could also be a situation of awkwardness, her knowing that my internship is for the full year and if anything would happen, we’re with each other until May",1,1729354372.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
