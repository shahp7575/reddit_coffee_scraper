So as stated in the title, I am a 21-year-old female, who is sick with the flu. I live with my mom and stepdad, lil sis, in process of moving in with partner. I have other health issues that factor in, but give you some backstory. I am coughing so hard that my body will literally seize up where I can hardly move and it has actually caused me to pull/strain muscles in my back and chest area I have also burst a blood vessel in my eye, as well as nonstop drainage, and very high borderline dangerous fevers.

My boyfriend needed to leave to go to Tennessee for about 24 hours last night and is still there currently. Called nmom last night to ask about coming home and she said to wait for tmr when shes at work because she was serious when she says im disgusting and she doesn’t want germs. I pulled up to the house about 10 and she was still there???(teacher) She was fine at first, thank god right? she had woken up after i had already brought my snow storm supplies back home and started packing a fun thing to do waiting for my love to get home. But we were talking a little and everything was fine drinking coffee im sitting all the way across a ten ft room, i had just finished explaining how horrible this cough is and explained everything exactly how i did here.. so i thought thered be no confusion. I started coughing, tried to bring my hands up to cover my mouth but started getting that tight seizing in my chest and ribs, she starts SCREAMING at me that im stupid and she should have told me not to come and now im trying to get her sick, and my sister, saying she’s already missed so much work from her broken foot (now healed and yes i was her caregiver and have storiessss), and how her 4 year old prek kids can cover their mouth. And how its so ridiculous that i couldn’t bring my hands up. I reminded her that my chest is literally seizing up on me and she herself admitted not even 3 minutes prior that she knows what feeling im talking about because she has had pneumonia alot in the past and that 4 year olds notoriously do NOT cover their mouth and ive worked with her school i know they dont( didn’t mention that but i so wanted to), she gets ridiculously angry when I say anything no matter tone of voice so of course she blew up and told me to get the f out and don’t come back for a while. Ignored me saying bye and i love her when i was walking out the door.. at least my lil sis said it and she even said drive safe sissy 🥺❤️❤️❤️

Ik this seems small but she is constantly screaming at me and blaming me for stuff out of my control or if its not going her way its my fault. Its just so frustrating being constantly on edge and not knowing what mood shes gonna be in or what will make her snap. She went 10 to 150 real fast just from coughing today.. shes gone 10 to 500 when i simply forget to start the dishwasher ( forget that i filled it and handwashed what didnt fit tho…) just trying to give small examples as i dont feel comfortable ranting about bigger stuff yet while i get used to trying out reddit more. Thanks for reading im sorry if not everything is super clear to read i have adhd&dislexia and do currently have a fever so writing is always a struggle and i mostly used voice to type.

Not because I don’t know what I want—but because I finally do.

I’m 35, a full-time dad of two incredible kids who mean the absolute world to me. They’re not just part of my life; they’re the center of it. Their laughter, curiosity, and fresh way of seeing the world remind me daily of what really matters.

After a lot of soul-searching (and some hard lessons), I’ve realized something simple and true about myself: I’m not meant to walk through life alone. No matter how independent or resilient I become, I’m someone who feels most whole when I’m sharing love with another person. Not just the big, cinematic moments—but the quiet ones. Morning coffee. Inside jokes. Talking about nothing and everything. Being fully seen, and fully showing up in return.

I’ve done the work. I’ve taken responsibility for who I was, who I am, and who I still want to be. I know how I need to be better in a relationship, and I’m clear about what I’m looking for—not perfection, but presence. Emotional availability. Kindness. A willingness to grow together.

You don’t have to be a mom. That’s not a requirement. But understanding (or at least being open to understanding) some of the trials and joys that come with loving someone who has kids will matter. What matters more is loving the magic that fresh minds bring into the world—the chaos, the wonder, the endless questions.

If you’re someone who believes love is built in the small moments, who values depth over games, and who is looking for a place to land and build something real—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

Here’s to honesty, courage, and seeing where a simple post might lead.

My husband and I have not been on the best terms in a very long time. We’ve been working on ourselves because both of us come from dysfunctional families and we find it hard to communicate with each other. 

I’m also a caregiver to my parent with illness, so we decided to not focus on the relationship at the moment, but to deal with our priorities and with ourselves first. 

My birthday is coming up and few days ago, when I mentioned about going on a coffee or brunch date alone, my husband said he could join me too. Today he says he has a sport event scheduled the same day, and was genuinely surprised because he didn’t realise what day my birthday was, he just knew the date and that it was approaching soon. Ngl, I was hurt. However I decided not to react immediately. 

Now I don’t intend to change my plans for him, I still would wanna go out as planned but I would be hurt. I know he wouldn’t cancel his event because it’s against his ethics & I don’t want to force him either because it’ll harbour resentment later on. 

Also, as far as I know him, he would suggest we order in something in the evening. I get a take out at least twice a week, so I don’t want to do that. My day is special and I have planned out something for myself.

1qpmlsw,https://open.substack.com/pub/davidrmann3/p/the-managers-playbook-running-a-smooth?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&utm_medium=web,The Manager’s Playbook: Running a Smooth Weekend Brunch Service,"**The Manager’s Playbook: Running a Smooth Weekend Brunch Service**

Your brunch shift will fail if you think it runs itself.

I have worked brunch at a 100-seat neighborhood joint and a 250-seat hotel restaurant. I have seen managers seat every table by 10:15 am because they didn’t want to say no. Ticket times climb to forty minutes. Servers apologize to tables who came for a quick meal before a wedding. Guests walk out angry. Staff break down in the dish pit. Cooks throw tickets across the line because the printer won’t stop.

Most of it was preventable.

The problem isn’t your menu. The problem isn’t your staff. The problem is seating guests faster than your team can serve them. Once that train leaves the station, you can’t get it back on track.

**The Math Doesn’t Lie**

Your team can take care of a certain number of people every fifteen minutes. That number is fixed by how many servers you have, how many seats each server can manage, how fast your kitchen’s line can turn tickets during peak volume.

Let’s say you have three working on the line at brunch. If you can only produce 25-entrees every 15-minutes with great ticket times, you shouldn’t seat more than that every 15-minutes. That’s 100 guests per hour. If you seat 120 guests between 9:30 am and 10:30 am, even if you spread them out, at least 20-people are going to have a bad experience. On the road, you can’t go faster than the car in front of you. In the restaurant, you can’t seat faster than the kitchen can cook. Their food will be slow. Their server will be stressed and challenged to keep winning over the guests. They’ll leave upset. They’ll tell people.

Brunch guests are less forgiving because they have somewhere to be. A ballgame. A show. A meeting. A family event. They’re on a schedule. Every online review platform shows the same pattern. Slow service complaints spike during weekend brunch. Not because the service is worse. Because the stakes are higher.

You can’t serve your way out of being overseated.

**The Hotel Problem**

At the 90-seat local spot, we knew our flow. Regulars came at 9 AM. Families hit at 10:30 AM. The after-church crowd rolled in after. We could predict it and staff accordingly.

The hotel restaurant was chaos.

You may not know what events are feeding guests in-house. You don’t know what deals the hotel’s sales team made with a corporate group because we weren’t operated by the hotel. You don’t know if a wedding party of 60 is going to walk in at 8 am or 10 am, expecting tables, because the sales lead was vague. You staff based on your understanding of past local events, and what knowledge you have of the different groups in the hotel, what you normally average. You pray you guessed right.

Some Sundays, we stood around folding napkins. On other Sundays, we got crushed.

The key wasn’t trying to be perfect. The key was controlling what we could control once service started. That meant controlling the door.

**Seat Control is Everything**

The host stand is the most important position in your restaurant during brunch. The host controls the flow. The host protects your seated guests.

When I managed brunch, I stood at the host stand during peak hours. Not because I didn’t trust my host. Because the host needed backup when guests got angry about the wait.

I tell every host that their job isn’t to fill tables. Your job is to protect the guests already seated. This means following our system and only seating 25-guests every 15-minutes. It means adapting if your servers are in the weeds, you slow or stop the door. If ticket times are pushing past 25-minutes, you slow seating, adjust the wait.

You quote a wait. You offer coffee while they wait. You take their name. You make them feel seen and comfortable. You don’t put them in a chair until your team can take care of them.

Guests who wait 15-minutes, who get great food and service, leave happy. Guests who sit immediately and wait 40-minutes for food leave angry. Do the brutal math.

**Prep Or Die**

Your prep cooks should spend Thursday and Friday setting up for the weekend. Not just prepping ingredients. Setting up systems.

Perhaps, pre-crack your eggs if you’re running an omelet station. Pre-cut your vegetables for scrambles and hashes. Make your Dutch Baby batter. Get your bacon par-cooked and ready to finish.

Then think about shelf life. Hollandaise holds for four hours. Pre-cracked eggs last two days. Your hash components can be prepped three days out, if labeled and stored correctly.

We made a prep sheet every Thursday that mapped every item on the brunch menu to a shelf life and a prep day. Nothing got prepped too early. Nothing got prepped too late. The walk-in was organized by expiration date. Cooks grabbed and went. You check and revise Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

I watched restaurants throw away hundreds of dollars in spoiled prep because someone did too much vegetable prep on Wednesday, and it was past its shelf life by Saturday. I watched other places scramble to prep during service because they didn’t start early enough.

Get it wrong, and you pay for it all weekend.

**The Pre-Shift Isn’t Optional**

I aspire to hold a pre-shift before every brunch service. Same time. Same spot. Every week. Everyone standing in a circle near the expo line before the first ticket dropped.

Specials and 86’d items. Any changes to the floor plan. Who is working in which section. Who is the go-to if someone gets slammed. Any large parties or reservations coming in. Any VIPS. Any prep concerns from the kitchen. What to push for the shift.

I skipped pre-shift once because we were short-staffed and I was running around trying to fix it. By 10 am, one server was seated a surprise twelve-top with no warning. The kitchen 86’d Eggs Benedict at 11 am, because we ran out of prepped hollandaise. Half the floor didn’t know until guests ordered it.

The pre-shift forced everyone to stop, look up, and remember we were a team. That mattered when service got hard.

**Mise-En-Place And Backup Plans**

Your line cooks need to arrive two hours before service starts. Not to cook. To set up their stations and think through what happens when they run out.

Every station should have a backup plan for its three most-used items. If you run out of hollandaise mid-service, what do you do? If you run out of bacon, where is more? If you run out of hash browns, can you pivot to a side of fruit?

At the hotel, we kept a Cambro of backup hollandaise ingredients in the walk-in during service. We kept extra bacon in the warming drawer. We kept extra eggs already cracked and ready.

The moment a cook ran low on something, they called it out. The chef or sous chef grabbed the backup. No one stopped cooking to run to the walk-in during a rush. No tickets died on the rail.

This sounds obvious. I’ve seen restaurants go down because the line ran out of hollandaise at 11 am and spent ten minutes digging through the walk-in, and more time blending it, while the printer screamed and tickets piled up.

**Cross-Train Your Kitchen**

The best kitchens I worked in had prep cooks who could step onto the line.

When we got slammed, the chef or sous chef pulled prep cooks, put them on eggs or plating. They didn’t have to be perfect. They had to keep food moving.

This meant cross-training everyone. Prep cooks spent time on the line during slow services. Line cooks rotated through stations. Everyone learned the flow.

Without it, you’re one callout away from disaster. One sick line cook, your whole service could collapse, or you reduce the number of guests you seat every 15-minutes, because no one else knows the station.

A prep cook who can crack eggs and flip an omelet is worth twice their hourly rate during a rush. A dishwasher who can plate desserts saves you when you’re buried.

Train your people. Pay them for the extra skills. Use them when it matters.

**The Manager’s Role During Service**

The manager doesn’t stay in the office. The manager is on the floor, watching the flow, making adjustments in real time.

I spent brunch moving between the host stand, the expo line, the kitchen, the floor. I watched ticket times. I watched server faces. I watched the door.

When ticket times hit twenty-five minutes, I slowed seating, adjusted the wait. When a server looked overwhelmed, I ran their food or bussed their tables. When the kitchen got backed up, I helped expo, or made the dish or two I could do. Sometimes you have to wash dishes.

New managers think their job is to manage from a distance. Your job is to be in the middle of it.

You can’t fix problems you don’t see.

**The One Thing That Matters Most**

I learned, after hundreds of brunch shifts, that you focus on the guests who are already seated.

Give them great food. Give them great service. Even if it means people at the door wait.

A guest who waits and then has a great meal comes back. A guest who sits immediately and gets ignored doesn’t.

Every decision I made during brunch came back to that principle. When I had to choose between seating another table or helping a server who was drowning, I helped the server. When I had to choose between filling the dining room or protecting ticket times, I protected ticket times.

The guests in your building are your responsibility. The guests at the door aren’t your responsibility yet.

Delay the seating. Control the flow. Protect your team. Serve the people you have before you serve the people you want.

That is how you run a smooth brunch.

I’m 33, from Michigan, and definitely more of a one on one conversation person than a group chat superstar. I’m quiet at first, but once I’m comfortable I’m thoughtful, sarcastic, and genuinely curious about people.

I like conversations that feel easy and unforced. The kind that start light and somehow end up deeper than expected. I’m a good listener, ask real questions, and appreciate calm energy, dry humor, and people who don’t feel the need to perform.

Outside of chatting, I enjoy reading, cooking, being outdoors when the weather cooperates, and relaxing with coffee or a good show. I keep a pretty normal schedule and usually respond consistently.

He told me he’s slept with people since he last got tested but always used condoms. We didn’t really get anywhere with the conversation. When we went to his room and started making out I told him I was on my period which was true, he didn’t push back that hard but said “you know I don’t care that you’re on your period” but I told him I didn’t want to and he didn’t push it further. 

6th date we went out to dinner (which I suggested) and then went back to his place after. We started making out while watching a show and he put his hand down my pants and told me to take off my shirt. We were in the middle of a show so I told him we should finish it first and after it ended it was late and I told him I needed to leave. He responded “is there a problem here” and said I seem standoffish and he wants a relationship where there’s passion. He seemed frustrated that we haven’t had sex yet. I reiterated to him that I had said before I’d like for him to get tested before we sleep together. He said he had been tested like a year and a half ago but I think he just made it up based on how he said it. I told him I didn’t have any big hang ups about sex I just value my health and once I’m in a relationship where we’ve been tested I’m very much into sex. We started making out again and he put his hand down my pants again and I told him to stop. He said he just wanted to finger me and we didn’t have to go all the way but I told him no and he didn’t push any further. Afterwards he said he would get tested and I would too. He texted me after that he had a good time but now I’m not sure if I should see him again. Looking for advice on what to do. ",1,1769631175.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Hello!

I'm posting to ask for help with a problem that has been happening for me on and off for about as long as I can remember.

My setup right now is Niche Zero, Hario Switch, Brita filtered water. I'll go into probably slightly too much detail, but just want to give everyone the opportunity to point out any little thing I might be missing..

On my Niche, I have the grind setting set a little bit past the coarsest printed setting (numbers go up to 50, I have it about 1/4"" past the 50). On a normal morning, I grind 25 grams of beans. I first knock out old grounds by forcefully closing the lid a few times, then add my 25 grams and grind. I heat brita-filtered water to 205 Fahrenheit. I close the valve on the switch, rinse the filter, let it sit for a minute or so to heat up the glass, and release the valve. Then I dump the paper water.

Next, I add the grounds to the switch and stir with my WDT to break up clumps (I also thought this might help with the stalling issue but it doesn't seem to). I bloom to between 2x and 3x. I usually lean closer to 3x, which would be 75 grams in this case. My thinking is that because my brews are stalling, the less water I have to wait to pass through the grounds the better, even if it's just 25 grams less. I stir the bloom with a spoon to make sure everything is evenly saturated, then I give it a light swirl to level the brew bed.

When my timer hits 1 minute, I close the valve on the Switch and pour to 400 grams. When the timer hits 2 minutes, I open the valve on the switch. Here's where it gets weird. I haven't taken detailed notes, but speaking anecdotally...about 1/3 of the time, the water drains in about a minute, resulting in 3 minutes total brew time. About 1/3 of the time, 80% of the water drains in the same amount of time, and the last 20% sits there for another minute or two. And the final 1/3 of the time (this just happened and prompted me to finally make this post), 80% of the water drains within a minute or so and the rest takes upwards of 5 minutes to drain. The total brew time on the coffee I just made was approaching 9 minutes.

I posted something less detailed about this a while ago, and people were saying that basically the Niche is terrible for pourover and that's my issue. But I can't imagine that this fancy, expensive (for an at home layperson) grinder is so terrible as to single-handedly account for a 9 minute draw down time. Am I crazy? Am I missing something?

A couple notes:

* I use the Switch because when things go well, I prefer the control. And I think the coffee does taste marginally better. This also happens on a regular V60 and Chemex.
* I'm using tabbed Hario V60 filters from a box. I have tried to buy the untabbed filters, but they're harder to find these days. I thought it was supposed to be box = faster drawdown/untabbed, bag = slower drawdown/tabbed but lately I have been ordering boxed filters and they have a tab.
* The inconsistency is what's so crazy to me. I do the exact same thing every morning, and get wildly different results. The cups that take 8 minutes aren't undrinkable, but they are definitely worse than the ones that brew properly.

**TL;DR:** My pourovers take anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes, and I can't figure out why!",1,1769631008.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

People watching…

Something I love to do during my morning coffee, walks in the park, or when it’s slow at work.

Different people,
discovering their own lives.
It’s fascinating to me.

Usually I don’t remember anyone…only seeing them once.
But you, I remember.

Sipping my morning coffee, I noticed you always slowed down during the spring to look at the blooming flowers.
Admiring the emerging petals, excited to see what beautiful creation it would turn into.

Chrysanthemums.

Those were your favorite.

I never got mad when you picked them from my front garden, unlike my grumpy neighbors.
You sang to old rock music, with a voice that even the bird would hang around too listen, while their  precious babies would be crying for food.

You picked up trash you had come across left from the reckless teenagers up the hill.
Said hello to early morning joggers.
Even brought your own treats to feed to the stray cats that hung around the corner.

You seemed so kind-hearted.

I always wondered where you were walking too,
to your day job, I had assumed…

When I stopped seeing you, my first thought was 
you had quit to work some place else.
Perhaps you found a better paying job more in the city.

I could see you working in the fashion industry, based off your unique choice of clothing.

Maybe you fell in love with someone and moved across the country…

That, I hope not.
Because even though I never met you, it felt like I was falling in love.

The way you admired earths creations, the light hitting your eyes making it look like a pot of honey…the way you walked with confidence…

I wished the best for you, on whatever journey you were embarking…

I started to notice other things once you stopped coming around.
A family of squirrels had a routine of grabbing nuts from the oak tree hanging above my porch.
They would chase each other around until one got a stomach ache, then run back under my neighbors fence.

But nothing is as interesting as you.

I missed seeing you.

So I’ll write it here for now.

To remember.

When I saw you on the news, that’s the first time I learned your name.

Anna. 

What a beautiful name…

From all the pictures, videos and comments I saw, I knew you were loved by many.

So this, I never would have expected.

It’s crazy that I saw you everyday, creating a narrative about you in my head.
But this was never part of it.

I’m sorry Anna. I’m sorry I never once introduced myself to be your friend.
I’m sorry this world is so cruel.
I’m sorry I couldn’t save you from the harsh reality of what we call life.
I’m sorry you didn’t get a fair chance for yourself to become happier…

I’ll promise I’ll collect all the Chrysanthemums I ever come across for the rest of my time, to honor you Anna.

1qpmbqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingfeedback/comments/1qpmbqv/medical_thriller_starter/,Medical thriller starter,"Hello there

I have the idea of a medical thriller story in my head and I’ve already gone through the whole thing in my mind. It’s about a patient dying during an emergency surgery and her husband blaming it on the surgeon so he comes back for revenge after the court dismisses the case. 

As I said I have the whole thing set but I have a hard time putting ideas into words. I wrote this a while ago and then hit a block but I want to continue writing. 

I have to say I did use AI for grammar and finding synonyms/replacements for words and sentences that did not sit well with me. English is not my first language and I’m trying to make my vocabulary better. 

I would love to hear your opinion on this and I will be really glad if you help me articulate my ideas through words.

I thank you for your time in advance

Here is the text:


Medical students fall in two categories; they either love surgery or don’t want to be around it at all. Medical dramas revolving around surgeons have certainly shaped medical students worldwide, but the real choice isn’t made until they step into the surgical ward. Seeing surgeons in action with your own eyes and not sugarcoated through dramas and love stories is much different. Failures happen more than what is shown on television and miracles are much more rare. You don’t get to see as many rare cases, even in referral hospitals it’s mostly cholecystectomies, fixing hernias, placing central IV lines and getting rid of bowel obstructions. Sleep deprived residents, nurses stretched thin and attendings chugging their coffee as they go to the operating room does impact one’s view on surgery. Is the love for surgery really worth giving up on good night sleep, proper nutrition and mental health for a lifetime?

A lot of people swear passion will make up for it until they see it with their own eyes. At the beginning of surgical rotation, roughly half of the students claim they consider surgery an option for their specialty, a lot of them claim they realized surgery wasn’t meant for them at the end. 

It’s weird to think about it; having life at your hands. People let surgeons cut them open at their most vulnerable state. The surgeon is in control of their life and most of the time, they’re sleeping through it. Trusting someone enough to let them go cut your body while you’re knocked unconscious is as serious as it sounds like. If it’s not life itself, the quality of it can change drastically at a single incision. Something surgeons struggle with is they stop seeing patients as people and see them as the problems they fix. It makes sense when you look at the bigger picture; the burden of having a person vulnerable under your hands is much greater than a problem waiting to be fixed.

A lot of surgeons are fighting to not lose who they are in the process, juggling between their conscience and professionalism. Seeing patients as human beings and not letting it override their judgment is easier said than done, especially when things go wrong and let me be honest about it; they go wrong a lot of times. 

Having a patient with an incurable condition that has to go through multiple procedures and deal with the pain just to live a couple more years, seeing children getting hurt in unfixable ways just because an adult turned their head on them for two seconds, hearing people scream in pain in emergency room not responding to medication, talking a patient through how they’ll never be able to live a normal life after the surgery that’s meant to make them better, … it all changes a person. 

Students look up to their professors. They want to be like them; tough, wise, thoughtful, logical. That is another burden on a surgeon; don’t show weakness, don’t let them think you’re a normal human being like them.

In surgery ward, we don’t sugarcoat things. We experience everything fully just as it is. Having fun is definitely allowed as long as it doesn’t go against the protocols. You gotta study a ton as knowledge is as important as skills here. 

Surgeons are always going to be mad at you anyway, so make this rotation worth it. Suture a couple wounds, watch your favorite surgeries. 

And don’t forget, chaos is always waiting. When you think everything’s fine it comes… and it never knocks. 

——

“26 year old female, blunt trauma to left abdomen-“

The resident was cut off by Dr. Hamid Kaveh; the youngest attending surgeon in the hospital. “On the phone you said she had free fluids in her left upper quadrant… why isn’t she in on the operating table already?” 

“We wanted to do-“

“You wanted to wait for her to die? That’s a clear  grade 5 spleen injury! She’s unstable! That’s a surgical emergency and you’re wasting her time. I want her to be on the bed prepped when I get there.” Kaveh headed towards the elevator to get to the second floor where the operating rooms were placed. The resident wrote the orders while running after the gurney taking the patient to the elevator. 

It took Dr. Kaveh a few minutes to change into his scrubs. He was the on-call attending of the shift but since he lived a few minutes from the hospital and could get there in time for any emergency, preferred to go home than stay in the hospital.

Dr. Sarah Ellis, the third year resident had already scrubbed in, getting ready to cut the midline open as Kaveh began washing his hands. “Start the surgery, she’s losing precious time here.” He said loud enough for her to hear through the barely open door of the operating room. 

Ellis couldn’t see anything as the abdomen was filled with blood, no matter how much they suctioned, the bleeding didn’t seem to stop. “How are you doing?” Asked Kaveh as he put his gloves on. 

“I can’t find the source of the bleeding…. I clamped the splenic artery but it’s still bleeding!” 

Kaveh stepped in, exploring the abdomen thoroughly, the spleen was all over. “There it is. Clamps.” He put the clamps in the pool of blood and clamped something. “Next time, don’t clamp a crushed artery so distal… let’s see if the blood supply to stomach is still there.” He waited for the abdomen to be cleared and the blood pressure to go up as the bleeding was resolved. The suction was trembling in Ellis’ bloodstained hand. “What’s her BP now?” Kaveh asked. 

“81 over 58”

Both Kaveh’s brows raised as he started exploring further through the abdomen. “She’s loosing blood somewhere… did you do the examination throughly or just made up that she didn’t have a fracture?” 

“She didn’t! She was awake when she came in and we checked for free fluid in her hips as well.” Dr. Ellis replied. “She was anuric so we couldn’t tell if she had hematuria.”

“What is- damn it.” Kaveh mumbled under his breath as he felt a growing bulge under his hand in retroperitoneal space. “Check her urine bag… NOW!” 

One of the nurses aimed for it quickly. The urine bag was almost empty but the few drops in it didn’t have any blood, no sign of hematuria. “It’s either the aorta or renal artery… be quicker Ellis!” There was a huge hematoma and active bleeding going behind there. 

“BP is falling… 65 over 32”

“Let’s pack… she can’t take it anymore… how many units did she get?” Said Kaveh as he tried to stop the bleeding. “It’s not enough!” 

The blood kept pooling. Everything that could go wrong was going wrong. The saline infusions and the fifth unit of blood was all in and her BP was still dropping. 

Ellis’ gown was covered in blood so was Kaveh’s. The monitor was beeping rapidly, screaming at the surgeons that their patient was dying. 

“Starting compressions!” 

“Push one milligram of epi!”

“C’mon… c’mon…”

“Stop compressions.”

“Nothing…” 

“Starting compressions!”

After two more rounds, there was nothing other than pulseless electrical activity. No heartbeat, just some crooked lines on the monitor that meant nothing. 

“Time of death… 1:43.”

Kaveh called it as he took off his gloves and threw them towards the bin across the operating room. His body was covered in sweat, his hands numb. He didn’t know who she was but couldn’t not feel sorry for her. 

The room fell silent as the monitor went dark. The soft thump of Kaveh’s disposable gown hitting the floor broke the stillness for a moment. Then the door creaked, and he was gone. The silence that followed made his thoughts louder. 

She never got to know that she wasn’t left alone. She never got to know they fought to save her. He let out a deep sigh. “What was her name?” He asked. 

“Amelia.” Ellis replied. “Her husband is outside. Should I-“

“I’ll talk to him. Check the report with me once you’re done.” He said, drying the sweat on his face with a tissue. 

He had delivered too much bad news to count but he never got used to it. Hearing the husband cry for his deceased wife was as bad as he imagined it would be. He was told it will get easier with time but it never did. 

The case was talked about in morning report the next day. How retroperitoneal bleedings can easily be missed on primary evaluation was mentioned and they came to the conclusion that she should’ve been brought in sooner. They did everything they could and failed. Case closed.

A 26 year old woman presented to the ER with trauma to left abdomen which she claimed was caused by the bookshelf falling on her. Her husband brought her in, saying she’d been unusually lethargic. Primary evaluation revealed tachycardia, tachypnea, low blood pressure, volume deficit, generalized tenderness and rebound tenderness, initial diagnosis was hemorrhagic shock caused by intraabdominal bleeding which was confirmed by FAST. Emergency laparotomy was performed revealing grade 5 spleen injury. The patient was still unstable after stopping the intraperitoneal bleeding which warranted further exploration, revealing ruptured renal artery, detached 1.5 centimeters away from aorta. The patient died due to massive hemorrhage caused by both intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal bleeding. 

The 26-year-old woman was someone’s wife, someone’s daughter, someone’s family, someone’s someone. But to the surgeons, she was one of many cases. Still, she lingered in their minds longer than most. Young people dying was something not even the most experienced surgeons could get used to, especially if it could be prevented. Only if she was brought in right after the trauma and not when she was already in shock state…. There were too many ifs and in many of them she could’ve survived. Going through every single one of the scenarios would drive a sane man insane. Imagine if a surgeon did that for every single patient that died or faced a morbidity. Perhaps trying to reduce patients to cases is the only defence mechanism they could find that actually worked. You talk about cases, look at them from different aspects to make sure you did nothing wrong and move on, but if you regard them as human beings, as someone’s someone, you can’t move on as easily. 

Kaveh never forgot her. He never forgot the patients he lost. He kept them somewhere in the corner of his mind and thought about them every now and then, about how he could’ve saved them if things didn’t go wrong. He didn’t think too much about it though. That could drive him insane. 

Many patients came after her. A lot of them survived, some of them died. Kaveh kept going. He moved on like every other doctor. 

Bad things happen, we look if we did anything wrong, learn from it and move on. 

In medical school differential diagnosis is talked about a lot; making sure you have all possibilities in your mind before you make the diagnosis. Medical students are advised to always consider rare but fatal diagnoses before the obvious and common ones because even though they are rare, missing them will come with huge consequences.

If you make no mistake but still lose a patient, you shouldn’t worry about anything. Doctors are prosecuted for mistakes, not incidents. At least that was what Kaveh thought - it was the obvious after all. He checked the report, shared the case with other attending surgeons, and had a good night’s sleep convinced he did nothing wrong.

What if he really missed something?
Not something about the patient.
Something about himself.

1qpmbop,https://www.reddit.com/r/WarKaisen/comments/1qpmbop/anya_trains_to_fight_gebura/,Anya trains to fight Gebura,"Anya Pov:

I was now back at the same forest I had meetings with the others in. Standing with me were Jickler, Jay, Kieren, Mahito, and Casey.  We were all sitting in the ground. “See, I told you she would win!” Casey said, shaking Jay by the shoulder as Jay slapped her hand away. “Yeah, while also nearly dying!” Jickler laughed as he seperated the two and looked at me.

“All things considered, you did an incredible job, Anya. Your awakening has also helped bring your power up to new heights. With some intense 6 days of training, I think you'll have a decent chance of impressing Gebura.” I smiled brightly. “T-Thank you, mister Jickler!” I said as he laughed. “Don't call me mister, makes me feel old…”

Kieren stood up, coughing intensely for a few seconds before speaking. “Besides just training, we need to make you a battle plan. Approaching someone as strong as her without a proper plan is suicide.” Mahito got up too with a stretch. “Yeah, but the problem is that while we know Gebura's abilities, which is kind of simple, we don't know how she exactly fights. The only example was against monkeyoverheaven, but that isn't really accurate considering Gebura was trying to protect us and was also far out of her league.”

Jay groaned as he looked at Jickler. “Why can't you just beat her ass and get it over with?” Jickler sighed as he ruffled Jay's hair. “First of all, I'm not that type of person. Second, this is between Gebura and Anya, mentor and student. It would be disrespectful for me to interviene. However…” Jickler walked up to me and placed his hand on my shoulder. “For the next 5 days, we will be training your ass off until you physically can't move anymore.” 

I shuddered as Casey smirked and got up. “How little do we think she can sleep?” Mahito raised his hand up. “5 hours!” I sighed as I raised my hand. “2 hours per day…I had to improvise as a phd student. With Monster energy, coffee mixed with coke, and adderal. I can go without sleep for a couple days” Mahito whistled as he then spoke up. “What type of training will she do? I reccomend we put a slightly bigger priority in physicality since Gebura is a purely physical fighter and Anya…is Anya”

I groaned but knew he was right. “Why don't we all train her in one specific area. Mahito, you're in charge of training her cursed energy control!” Mahito did a thumbs up. “Kieren, you're in charge of teaching Anya how to use a sword!” Kieren nodded and coughed a little as I shrieked. “W-W-Why do I have to use a-a sword? What if I accidentally cut my arm off?” I whimpered as Kieren patted my back. “Just heal it with reverse cursed technique. Besides, under me, while you won't be as skilled as Gebura, not even close, you'll be very skilled for a begginer.”

“Jay, you and me are in charge of physical training!” Jickler shouted as Jay smirked and jumped up. “Alright!” Jickler than pointed To Casey. “Casey! You're in charge of training her cursed energy qualities. Control, output, reserves etc.” Casey smiled. “I'll enjoy ripping you in two, Anya-chan\~” I whimpered as I hugged Jickler's leg. “Why, Jickler. Whyyyy…” I sobbed.

“Wait, who will handle combat strategies?” Jay asked until we all heard a new voice. “That would be me…” We all looked behind us and saw him, Nisp. He eas wearing a white hoodie, and baggy blue pants. “I have already fought the sorcerer of justice before, so I am most fit for this task…” I smiled upon hearing his voice. “I'm glad you came!” I said as Nisp scoffed but smirked a little.

“Alright! Training starts tommorow at 3 a.m, and I'll text you all the schedule in the groupchat. Someone should also add Nisp there too…” We all smiled and fist bumped as we then seperated, all heading back towards where we will rest, for there will be no time for rest after today.",1,1769630647.0,WarKaisen,0,1.0,False

1qpmacn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qpmacn,70s Italian MCM inspired coffee table (with vase and books),"I love the flamboyant fringes of late MCM so I built this little coffee table during a recent snow storm.

The legs are made from 4 wood beads each (one cube and 3 spheres of decreasing size) threaded onto the stem/handle of a Q-Tip, which keeps them centered and gave me something to hold while painting. The other wood trim and apron are coffee stir sticks.

The tiles are just squares I cut from a wallpaper sample, then glazed with 3 layers of clear nail polish. I don't mess with the UV curing kind, regular topcoat worked just fine for the ceramic effect I was looking for. The grout is dollar store air-dry clay.

(The vase is a painted bead and the books are other scraps from wallpaper samples and foil around simple foamcore and a chunk of a craft stick.)

I'm really pleased with how this turned out considering I was basically improvising as I went. I do have woodworking skills (to an extent) and access to a kiln so I'd like to consider this a prototype and make it again with real walnut lumber and maybe even real ceramic? But that also seems like a daunting thing to take on so for now I'm just going to be happy with this. It makes me want to make a tiny espresso serving set and a groovy ""fat lava"" style ashtray to go with...

So, I have known my husband (57M) since high school. We married much later in our lives, and have been together 17 years. 

As a kid, his family had it rough. I don't want to get into his details, but they often struggled to have food on their table. Lived in some pretty difficult places, too. Needless to say, he is very much a creature of habit now. There are certain things he likes, things he doesn't, and he tends to pick the same food and drink over and over again.

Which brings me to this question: Due to the long hours of my husband's work, he usually has some type of energy drink in the morning. They were usually the kind of flavor packets he would put in his water. Othertimes, he would just take a soda.

He has never once expressed an interest in coffee or tea. 

But two weeks ago, he began heating the kettle for water to make coffee. Last week, he bought a miniKeurig to make a cup each morning. Before this, I had never seen him drink a cup of coffee.

So, should I be concerned? What makes someone who has one habit for all our married life suddenly change? Would there be some health reason to do this?

I am just looking for some possible theories.",4,1769630397.0,AskMenAdvice,14,1.0,False

I have a very physically-demanding job, which also requires mental clarity. Eating anything during the day makes me extremely tired and brain foggy, so I've decided to try fasting during the day and eating OMAD at dinner. In the past, coffee would be my go-to for energy during the day, but I've been too reliant on it, and I've recently gotten off it, so now I'm seeking supplements to help balance me out. I need a stack that's calming + provides physical and mental endurance + not too stimulating.   
  
**I've experimented with the following:**

Acetyl-L-Carnitine - this is gentle enough and helps my focus/mental energy and I can take 1 pill in the morning and 1 pill in the afternoon to continue the effect. I will most likely keep taking this one.

Creatine - this tends to make me too irritated, even just 1g (however I have not yet tried it *without* coffee, so I will try it again on its own)

Ginseng Root Extract - tends to be too stimulating even on its own

Energy Drinks with Taurine - for some reason taurine + caffeine gave a really ideal effect both physical & mental and I felt motivated/energetic/calm for the whole day. However, I don't want to rely on caffeine.

Siberian Ginseng (Eleuthero) - (not ND brand) - this gives me a ton of physical endurance and would be an ideal for me, however it causes too much mental irritation/over-stimulation.

NADH Powder - didn't notice an immediate energy boost, but also did not give it enough time.

CoQ10 Ubiquinol - also didn't notice an immediate affect and did not give it enough time.  
  
**I haven't tried the following yet, but am considering:**  
  
Taurine - I read that it's a GABAA agonist and anything that upkeeps my GABA has been beneficial for me in the past. I think that part of why I feel lack of energy during the day is the fight/flight mode that drains me, so my hope is this will limit that affect.

Sensoril Ashwagandha - I imagine this will help with my HPA axis dysregulation and support fatigue/energy reserves.

These are just *hopes*.  

Anybody have recommendations that could support physical/mental energy during the day while being gentle enough for my anxiety-driven HPA-axis dysregulation?

My rebounder is a hexagonal one (six corners).

It is kept in place by velcro. It’s made from one big strip of rectangular fabric without any structuring, far as I can tell. 

My question is, any rebounders here who have done this for a hexagonal rebounder?

Hurricane,Utah 
Friday, March 15, 2024 
6:00 a.m

It was the beginning of another day in the famous city of Hurricane. Sunlight softly reflected off the old vintage buildings as people hurried out of their homes toward work, and the neon signs of restaurants and diners flickered off one by one.
In the old suburbs of the city, in a quiet and cozy neighborhood, stood an old house—large, yet with a welcoming appearance.

In one of the rooms of this house, where sunlight delicately filtered through the curtains, the space was filled with posters and vintage objects. There, Emilly slept deeply in her bed, surrounded by stuffed animals and cozy blankets. Then, the persistent sound of the alarm clock echoed through the room, accompanied by the meow of Kitty, her black cat, waiting outside the window.
The young woman finally opened her eyes and reached out to turn off the alarm.

—Okay, okay… I’m awake, Kitty— murmured Emilly, her voice still heavy with sleep, as she stroked the cat’s head.

She slowly sat up in bed, her long, voluminous golden hair cascading over her shoulders. She picked up her phone from the nightstand to check her reminders and realized she had a meeting scheduled in two hours at the famous Freddy's Family Dinner.

—I still can’t believe I got an offer from such a big company like Fazbear Entertainment. I wonder what the owner himself wants to talk to me about— Emilly wondered aloud, a mix of curiosity and anxiety in her voice.

She then slowly got up and walked to the bathroom to get ready and take her medication.
For several long minutes, Emilly stared at her reflection in the mirror. The scars on her body drew attention—deep, irregular, unpleasant marks spread across nearly all her skin, except her face. They were silent reminders of a past she couldn’t fully recall and one of the main reasons she had suffered bullying at the old psychiatric orphanage where she had lived before finally leaving upon turning eighteen.

These thoughts began to fade when Kitty started rubbing around her legs, purring softly.
—Are you hungry, Kitty? I’ll put your food out in a moment, little glutton. I have a feeling today’s going to be a very long day— said Emilly, letting out a small smile after swallowing her last pills.



Freddy's Family Dinner 
Friday,March 15, 2024
7:50 a.m.

The day was sunny with only a few clouds in the sky. Emilly rode her small red scooter unhurriedly toward the famous Freddy's Family Dinner, still lost in thought about the email she had received from William Terrence Afton, the current owner of Fazbear Entertainment, a few days earlier. Of course, he was one of the four original co-founders of the company, alongside Henry Joel Emily, Edwin Davis Murray, and Fiona Margaret Murray. Yet, deep inside, Emilly felt an overwhelming discomfort mixed with fear whenever she saw or read about Mr. Afton.

She had often heard stories from some of the town’s older residents about the tragedies and incidents that had occurred at the company’s establishments during the seventies, eighties, and nineties—ranging from disappearances and murders of children and employees to bodies found inside animatronic suits. Although the police never caught the culprit, these cases were quietly shelved due to lack of evidence and company bribery. Over time, they gave rise to urban legends and rumors that the restaurants were haunted, though eventually, these tragedies were mostly forgotten, remembered only as tales to scare children.

As she thought about this, Emilly finally caught sight of the façade of the famous Freddy's Family Dinner, one of the many company restaurants still standing since the eighties. She parked her scooter in the crowded lot, despite it still being early. She looked toward the entrance and saw a crowd of people, mostly children, entering the massive building alongside their parents, wide smiles painted on their faces.

—What could be so special about this place?— Emilly wondered as she stepped inside the restaurant. Upon entering, she noticed a large reception area where a familiar old face stood behind the counter. Wearing the restaurant’s caricatured security uniform was Mike Schmidt, an old high school friend Emilly hadn’t seen in years.

—Mikey? Is that you?— Emilly asked.

—Emilly? Wow, what a surprise! It’s been ages since high school. How are you? Are you still in photojournalism and working as a freelance reporter?— Mike said, surprised to see her, despite his tired face, seemingly trying his hardest to stay awake while on the job.

—Yes, I am. I got an offer to work on a documentary and some reporting here, and I’m heading now to meet the owner himself. By the way, do you know where Mr. Afton might be?— Emilly asked.

Mike looked at Emilly with a weary expression and pointed in a direction.

—Ah, my boss… well, his office is backstage. I’ll ask Ness to help you since… I’m way too busy— Mike said.

—That won’t be necessary, Mike. I’m already here— said a voice. Suddenly, a man with a friendly appearance appeared, wearing glasses and a yellow bunny pin, accompanied by a young woman with pink and purple streaked hair tied in a ponytail, dressed in a security uniform like Mike.

—Ah, Vanessa, you brought your dad. I was just about to ask you to help Emilly find him— Mike said, returning to his work.

Vanessa nodded slightly, a faint smile on her lips, while William adjusted his glasses.

—Miss Emilly, it is a pleasure to finally meet you in person. I hope your trip here was pleasant— he said, extending his hand.

—It was fine, Mr. Afton— Emilly replied, shaking his hand while trying to mask the immense discomfort and fear growing inside her.

—Well, we have much to discuss, don’t we? Let’s go to my office, away from the noise— he said, gesturing for Emilly to follow him.
Emilly nodded and followed.

They passed through internal corridors where the sound of children laughing and cheerful music gradually gave way to a strange silence, broken only by the distant hum of machinery and the soft creak of the old floor. The walls were adorned with vintage Fazbear Entertainment posters—smiling mascots with unnaturally large eyes frozen in artificial poses.

For a brief moment, Emilly had the unsettling sensation that those eyes were following her.
William stopped in front of a wooden door and opened it.

—Please, make yourself comfortable. I believe this conversation will be very productive— he said with a polite smile.

Freddy's Family Dinner, Management Office
Friday, March 15, 2024
8:10 a.m.

The room was silent. Emilly sat in a chair, facing William, who was sipping a bit of coffee.

—Well, I suppose you’ve seen the email I sent you, haven’t you?— the man asked.

—Yes, I saw it a few days ago, but tell me, Mr. Afton… why would such a large and famous company like yours want a documentary and promotion produced by a small company like mine?— Emilly asked.

William let out a soft laugh and turned his gaze toward the window, observing the distant activity of the restaurant.
—To be honest with you, my young lady, I don’t trust these big media companies. They always find a way to twist everything involving Fazbear Entertainment, and it’s extremely difficult to disprove those lies once they spread. That’s why I’m looking for someone fair, competent… and with true journalistic talent. Someone like you— William replied.

Emilly took a deep breath.

—I see. So what exactly do you expect from me? A documentary? A promotional video? Or something beyond that?— Emilly asked.

William smiled. He then opened one of the drawers of his desk and pulled out a yellow envelope, which he carefully placed in front of her.

—Here is everything you need to know. I want a full documentary and a promotional video. In this document, I’ve listed the areas of the restaurant you may film and photograph… oh, and I also included the payment amount and the period you may stay with the company— the man said.

Emilly looked at the document and was quite surprised to see an incredibly high sum of money—enough to buy a larger studio, a team of professionals, and high-quality equipment. On top of that, the time frame was ten months. An offer impossible to refuse.

—So, Mrs. Campbell, do you accept the job?— William asked, extending his hand.

—You can count on me, Mr. Afton. I’ll give my best to create the documentary and promotional video— Emilly said, shaking his hand. William’s expression showed satisfaction at her response.

—Then welcome to our family. You’ll begin your work tomorrow night, as it’s the only time the restaurant isn’t busy— William said.
Emilly nodded, gathering the documents and standing up from the chair.

As she left the office, she had the strange sensation that the moment the door closed behind her, an unusual chill began to creep over her.
William Afton remained seated, watching the
closed door, his coffee slowly cooling on the table.

A subtle smile formed on his lips.

—Oh… this is going to be very fun— the man murmured.

I do regular cleaning, etc. with it being a few years old, do you think id benefit from buying a single dose grinder and using it instead of the built in grinder?. I would just replace the burrs, but i'm intending to buy a Rocket Appartamento in the next few months and would be needing a new grinder regardless. Purely asking would I benefit from buying a new grinder now to work alongside the barista express while I still have it.

​I recently bought a Moccamaster KBG Select and decided to start grinding my own beans. I picked up the Timemore C3S Pro Max (not the ESP version) to see how it tastes, but I'm finding it hard to get the settings right.

​Does anyone have this same combination? How many clicks would you recommend on the C3S Pro Max for this specific batch size and flow rate?

​Here is my routine:

​Ratio: 30g coffee to 500ml water.

​Setting: I use the ""Half Jug"" switch on the Moccamaster.

​Roast: Medium roast (Colombia).

But I still want to leave this message. I made the mistake of going back and rereading everything. It finally hit me that you’re really not here. I miss talking to you, letting you know that you’re doing great and that you’re an amazing person.

I know you felt guilt over things that transpired and I’d be a liar if I told you that I wasn’t absolutely furious over you withholding important information. I understood one thing you weren’t honest about, but everything else? I felt…lost. Like if you couldn’t be honest with me about something as simple as the other two things, maybe I wasn’t owed anything at all by you.

But, I still wanted you. Things weren’t the same after you came clean, and I feel like we both knew it. I was definitely more guarded, and you may have sensed that. I knew you were pulling away, but I didn’t want to acknowledge that the end was close.

Then Wednesday happened. You were in town and said you needed to think about what you wanted to do, and I told you to take a few days and let me know what your decision was. 

Then, I cried. I cried in a coffee shop, the barista asked if I was okay. I told her I was. I was not. My heart was broken. And I hated you. I hated you for a whole 10 minutes before I needed to get back to work.

Saturday night came with your decision. I didn’t cry this time. You wanted to be a better person, and I understood where you were coming from. I didn’t understand why though. You told me that you felt so happy when we talked, you couldn’t be honest about yourself with others the way you were with me. Maybe that’s because I’m just naive? Maybe it was because I didn’t have the experiences you had? Maybe, I was just stupid.

I told you I had developed feelings during our short time together, and I asked if you had too. You said yes. I wanted to press and ask you to put a name to that feeling. I had put a name to mine, but was too chicken to say it. If I had, would you have stayed? Would you have said it back? 

I want you to know that I put on a brave face my entire time with you. That confident, somewhat assertive woman you were talking to? She only came out with you. In reality, I was still a nervous girl who just wanted to find someone who cared. A nervous girl who believed that there were one too many coincidences when it came to us.

But this letter is getting too long. Back to today. I reread our messages, and the tears came again.

I miss you so much, and I feel like it’s not fair that you get to break my heart all over again and its not fair that you won’t know how hurt and dejected I’m feeling and I can’t do anything about it.",2,1769629837.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.75,False

Today my LDL came back 142, down from 149 at my last visit but I’ve been threatened with statins. After my last visit in October, I cut fats. I switched from half and half to milk in my coffee, from 2% to non-fat yogurt. I limited my PB intake to once a week if not less (where before it was maybe twice) and cut out all recreational (snack) cheese. Being that I eat a kind of low carb diet and already eat tons of veggies (I’m a vegetarian of over two decades), I was starving every day. Even loading up on a whole extra portion of vegetables and protein at meals wasn’t helping much. So I decided to increase fats a little but start working out more routinely which means paying for classes with strict cancellation policies to keep me accountable. I’m doing one HIIT and one Sweat/Sculpt class a week since early December. I feel great and strong, but after all this I’ve only decreased my LDL 7 points. 

Genetically, I do have a family history of heart disease, and strokes/blood clots but unlike my grandfather who fried his bacon in butter and had multiple heart attacks, or my other grandparents who smoked all their lives, I am not a smoker, I eat a high fiber and high protein diet, cooking in high quality olive oil a tablespoon or two at a time, and I only eat butter if really, really good bread is available at home (almost never) or when I make cookies (rare and I only make one or two at a time). 

I’m nervous that statins are going to mess with my control (today’s A1C is 5.6 and that’s actually up for me from 5.4), and I don’t want the digestive issues either but I wanted to see how people are feeling on them? Do you have a lot of the side effects? ",0,1769629244.0,diabetes_t1,11,0.5,False

1qpljuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1qpljuv/whats_the_healthy_thing_to_do_when_your_partner/,What’s the healthy thing to do when your partner is not hearing an issue you had/is repeating their own view?,"My partner and I are having an issue right now and I don’t know how to deal with it in a healthy way. I had just woken up and we went upstairs to get coffee. I wasn’t feeling good last night so he asked me how I was doing. We then proceeded downstairs and he sat at his computer. I stayed on the stairs to talk and told him how I was doing. He responded by saying he’s sorry I’m still feeling bad. I then go quiet (alright here’s a part where we listen and don’t judge. I’m in therapy, we are working this out and don’t need any advice on this. Seriously, just give me advice on what I’m asking please.) I go quiet because I have anxiety issues in the relationship and I’m trying to keep my anxiety to myself. So when I go quiet he doesn’t do anything he just proceeded to get on his computer. I was confused because I was sitting there clearly wanting to talk. But I was quiet for a moment. 

I get up and ask about if we’re going to the store then we end the convo and I go back to the room. But I’m pretty upset because I felt completely ignored on the stairs. So I told him my issue. I said it hurt that he just didn’t say anything not even asking if we’re done talking, just turned and got on his laptop. While I was sitting there. When I stated my issue he said he didn’t ignore me he just got on his laptop because he wasn’t feeling good and I stopped talking and went quiet and thought I was just anxious and he wanted to chill. I said ok, but why didn’t he ask if we were done talking? 

Now he’s arguing that he wasn’t ignoring me. And he starts using my anxiety saying I always have it so he just assumed that’s what was going on and he didn’t think we were talking anymore. 

Whenever I tried to tell him my feelings though he just got more worked up and defending himself. When I say I don’t feel considered he fights back with he asks me what I’m thinking all the time. And says he always considers me. I try to bring it back to ok yes but I’m having this issue right now. I felt ignored. He then cuts me off saying he didn’t ignore me. And defends his stance on what was going through his mind at the time. This is a huge pattern when I bring up issues. It takes hours of me explaining my feelings and getting cut off to finally be heard. Is it all the time? No. But it happens when he’s not feeling good, or night time when he’s tired. Right now he’s cold turkey-ing cymbalta because his doctor said he needed an appointment to continue it. So I do know he’s not feeling good at all. But I didn’t think my issue would bring in a fight like this. I knew I wasn’t going to be heard and I didn’t want to continue not being heard. So I stopped the conversation. I didn’t know what else to do. But I don’t know the healthy way to figure this out. What is the healthiest way to deal with this issue? ",2,1769628986.0,NoStupidQuestions,2,1.0,False

READ THIS IF YOU’VE BEEN CRAVING REAL RP SISTERHOOD. 🩷✨,"Hi beautiful 💕 I’m **27, from Tennessee**, and I’m not looking for casual RP or surface-level connections — I’m searching for my **RP sisters**, the girls I’ll build lives with in the city. The kind of friendships where we’re always together — laughing, getting into trouble, supporting each other, and creating storylines so deep they feel real long after you log off. I want RP that feels alive, emotional, and unforgettable… and if we truly vibe? I’d *love* for those connections to turn into real friendships too 🩷

A little about **me** ✨ — I’ll be playing as part of an **MC club**, fully committed to **loyalty, sisterhood, grit, and ride-or-die energy**. I LOVE deep MC RP — family dynamics, protection, respect, and powerful storylines — but I’m also the girl who brings the *fun*. I’m the one planning nights out, hyping my friends up, treating my girls, and making sure nobody ever feels left out. If you want RP where you’re constantly doing things together, I’m your girl 💕

Think **real-life RP moments**:  
✨ shopping sprees just because we can  
✨ coffee shop mornings where we spill everything  
✨ bar hopping, club nights, dancing until sunrise  
✨ throwing parties, celebrating milestones, birthdays, wins  
✨ messy drama, laughter, tears, and unforgettable nights  
✨ girls’ nights that turn into core memories

This is all happening in a **brand-new GTA roleplay server**, **Coming Home RP**, opening **February 6th** — built around **realism, immersion, and long-term storytelling**. This isn’t rushed RP. This is about building characters with history, emotions, and growth — and making women a powerful part of the city ✨

🚑 **EMS women** — emotional calls, hospital sisterhoods, decompressing after trauma, late-night talks, and bonds that feel like family.  
🚔 **Police women** — meaningful patrols, investigations that unfold naturally, trusted partners, respect earned, and storylines that matter.  
🖤 **MC & gang women** — deep loyalty, protection, family, sisterhood, power, and RP where women are central, respected, and influential.  
☕ **Civilian women** — businesses, friendships, romance, drama, cozy routines, and slice-of-life moments that make the city feel real.

I’m looking for women who want **slow-burn RP**, emotional depth, realism, and genuine connection. Girls who uplift each other, have fun together, show up for one another, and want RP that feels like a **TV series you’re living inside** — not just logging into 🩷

If you’ve been searching for a place where you’re not just another face… where you find **your people**, your sisters, your safe space — **this is your sign** 💌

✨ **DM me** if this made your heart race even a little. Let’s see if we click and start building something unforgettable when **Coming Home RP opens on February 6th** 🩷✨",1,1769628979.0,GTARP,0,1.0,False
1qpljdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1qpljdi/i_messed_up/,I messed up!,"I was doing SO well! The last time I drank my vodka was the night of the 2024 Election. But that topped off a very heavy year of drinking and disgusting hangovers. When I was a younger woman, there were NO hangovers. Ever. Not even once. My friends would be absolutely astonished because I'd drink so much vodka every night and be at work at 8:00 every morning, feeling just fine.

As a sidenote, I was in a near fatal car accident (not my fault, I was the passenger). I suffered a broken neck and back and was 99% gone. By some miracle I survived and as a result have unbearable chronic pain. So I am on Hydrocodone for life. It helps, but not all that much. Please don't judge me for taking them. I get 112 every 28 days.  Many people say the Norcos are what kept me from hangovers.

I stopped drinking cold turkey the day after the election in 2024. No problems. Not once did I crave booze or have withdrawals. I began to hate even the thought of alcohol! All I'd have to do is walk down the alcohol aisle at the grocery store and I'd feel like I was going to throw-up! 

So, no more drinking the rest of 2024 and all of 2025. I came close to it once mid 25, bought a large bottle of vodka, but when I got ready to pour a glass, I got pissed at myself and threw the whole bottle down the drain. 

Fast forward again to last Friday night, 1/23/26. I went to dinner with my childhood friend I hadn't seen in years. She had just got out of prison, a place I VERY MUCH fantasize about being in myself. At dinner, we talked about going to get a drink. So, we went to the liquor store and got a 1.75 L of Platinum Vodka. I debated doing it, but in the end, I took a drink.

You all know the rest! Felt pretty good after one drink. Felt amazing after two! Before you know it, I drank her under the table and had seven drinks, then we ordered our favorite pizza ever, Me\~N\~Ed's. She ate 4 pieces, I ate 12! The booze made me feel loose and hungry!

OMG, I paid oh so dearly for this. All that booze, all that pizza. I didn't get one wink of sleep that night. Massive headaches, threw up 11 times, heart racing out of my chest, and dry mouth from absolute hell. I fully remembered why I completely stopped in late 2024! OMG!

The next day I drank again, finishing off the bottle. Two half full coffee mugs worth. Still got another hangover, but not as bad. To make matter worse, I'm out of my Norcos until this Friday afternoon. I have some Kratom that I have taken the last few days in place of the Norco. Some people say it works just as good. I say total BS. The only thing it does is ***maybe*** reduce the cravings for Norco, but it surely didn't help with my hangover. 

I pray that this f-up will be just an isolated incident. I, absolutely, do not want to go back to drinking. It's been a few days now, and I haven't had any desire to drink. For me, the hangovers are the absolute worse thing ever. In 2022, I was in the hospital with a horrible case of COVID, and was beyond miserable. But I'd STILL rather be in Kaiser with COVID for two weeks than have even one damn night of a hangover! I hope there are no more incidents with alcohol!!!

1qplifz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qplifz,Im creating a pvp marketplace / social media etc.. where you can own a line and make a profit. I need suggestions.,"I built a project called **The Million Lines**. Originally, it was a standard digital billboard where you buy a line for $1.

But static billboards are boring. I wanted to make it a game where people can actually profit and compete for visibility. I’ve just pushed a massive update introducing an economy, and I need feedback on how to make this a place people actually want to ""kill time"" on, rather than just buy and leave.

**The Core Mechanics:**

* **The Billboard:** 1,000,000 lines..
* **Sniping (The Economy):** If you see a spot you want that’s already taken, you can ""Snipe"" it. You pay 1.4x the current value. The original owner gets paid out instantly (they make a profit), and you take the spot. The line value goes up forever.
* **Heat System:** It’s not just about money. I built a ""Heat"" algorithm that ranks lines based on clicks, upvotes, and value. The hottest lines float to the front page.
* **Reddit Integration:** I built a proxy that lets you type in r/YourSubreddit, and it automatically pulls your banner, icon, and colors to style your line instantly.
* **Extra Features on your line:** Other colors, background colors, add url/flag or spoiler costs extra.
* **Active Lines ( Lines that are not sniped ):** The owner of these lines are free to edit their line any time. 
* **Linage (Sniped Lines):**  Your text and heat score are frozen in time forever as a historical record. Direct Links Work Saved on Profile Snapshot Locked
* **Only the hottest lines stay on the front page.** Profitable Pixels Visual Economy Every time a line is sniped, its value increases. Buy low, hold for heat, and get bought out for a guaranteed ROI. The Lineage Archive When sniped, your line isn't deleted. It moves to the Lineage.

**The Struggle:**  
The ""Buy and Sell"" logic works great. But I want this to feel like a social feed, somewhere you go to doom-scroll, read funny messages, find new crypto projects, or discover subreddits.

**My Questions for you:**

1. Does the ""Sniping"" mechanic (getting paid to lose your spot) sound fun, or annoying?
2. What features would make you actually scroll through 1,000 text lines? (Comments? A global chat?
3. Also, how could I make a tutorial or welcome message that will make people understand the concept.",1,1769628899.0,website,1,1.0,False
1qplh3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1qplh3b/the_cigarette_case/,The Cigarette Case,"🇵🇱Gdańsk, Poland. The 90s.

Kazimierz found the cigarette case one morning on a bench as he walked his usual route through the park to the shipyard, where he worked as a painter. In the gloom, the ugly outlines of creaking cranes loomed, resembling sick birds, and the smell of dampness and rotting autumn leaves seemed to crawl directly into his soul, causing fits of melancholy.

Kazimierz looked around and, seeing no one nearby, picked up the case from the rain-soaked bench. It was silver, looked simple — without inscriptions or engravings. On the move, Kazimierz opened it and saw that it was full.

— O kurwa! — Kazimierz exclaimed with joy. — O kurwa! To dobrze!

He was genuinely happy about the find: his cigarettes had run out yesterday, and Kazimierz desperately wanted a smoke. He took out a filter cigarette with no markings, sniffed it, and, after making sure it was tobacco, lit it and took a greedy drag. His head swam, and with a sigh of relief, he exhaled the smoke, noting that the tobacco was excellent. Pleased, feeling as if on wings, Kazimierz hurried to the gate to make it to his shift on time.

The rusty wind beat against the walls of the smoking area when the crew came out for their afternoon break.

— Got a smoke, Kazimierz? — his partner Tadeusz asked, coughing terribly and spitting up yellow phlegm. — We’ll smoke mine tomorrow.

— Here, — Kazimierz said, opening the case and offering him a cigarette.

— Wow, good tobacco, — Tadeusz said, taking a drag, and again went into a fit of coughing, exhaling smoke.

— Kurwa mać, this painting work will be the end of me, I’ll cough up my lungs, — Tadeusz rasped glumly.

Kazimierz remained silent. He knew about the harm, but he continued to go to this job, as if chained, just like all the other laborers. He saw their thoughts on their faces in the morning and knew what they were thinking when they walked home from work.

The next morning, Kazimierz, as always, woke up earlier than anyone else and left while his son and wife were still asleep. Coffee and a cigarette on an empty stomach were his loyal morning friends. And, opening the case, he saw that it was full again.

— Matko Boska!, that can’t be! — Kazimierz exclaimed and began to carefully examine the case and the cigarettes. Nothing unusual. But he couldn’t believe his eyes and tore up one cigarette: it looked like tobacco, good tobacco, and the smell was right.

— Fine, — he said, snapping the case shut and finding no explanation for what had happened. He lit up, sipping his coffee, looking out the window, and thinking about the miracles that still happen in this world.

So several days passed, and every morning the case was full. Kazimierz, offering the foreman a cigarette in the morning, asked about Tadeusz.

— I called his wife, Agnieszka, last night, — the foreman replied. — She said he died. First, he started throwing up blood, and then he coughed up his lungs into the sink. The ambulance didn’t make it.

— Jezu Chryste… — Kazimierz whispered, his blood running cold, and stepped away. He understood that the case was the cause. The very one from which he had been handing out cigarettes left and right. “Who’s next?” — Kazimierz thought with horror. After smoking down to the filter and burning his fingers, he immediately lit the next one.

— Heard the news, Kazimierz? — the workers asked in the smoking area.

— What news? — he asked, growing cold inside.

— Waldek, our grinder, died. He choked on phlegm in his sleep. How did he manage that?..

Kazimierz shrugged indifferently and, without another word, went back to work.

Over the next few months, a series of accidents and fatal illnesses wiped out almost the entire old crew of their shift. Only Kazimierz and a few other guys who didn’t smoke were left. Just yesterday, after work, when Kazimierz offered a cigarette to a new guy, the man died in a crash, his head hitting the dash as his car swerved into oncoming traffic. The cause of the accident was a cigarette that had fallen onto the seat.

Maybe the cigarette case wasn’t forgotten or lost, but left there on purpose? Maybe someone before couldn’t bear the weight and got rid of it that way?

These thoughts swirled in Kazimierz’s head as he stood early in the morning in that same gloomy park at the familiar bench. He thought: it’s time to leave it, to throw it away for good, enough!

At the same time, he rationalized it to himself: now he was more careful — he only offered cigarettes from the case to random passersby. For his own, he had a regular pack.

— Tomorrow… I’ll throw it away tomorrow, — Kazimierz promised himself and hurried to work, knowing deep down that this “tomorrow” would never come.

That night, his son woke up, needing to use the toilet. Returning, he noticed the edge of the cigarette case sticking out of his father’s jacket pocket. Listening — everyone was asleep — he quietly and carefully pulled out two cigarettes for himself and a friend.

“Well, even if Dad notices, what’s he gonna do? Spank me?” — the boy thought.

A feature I would love an official gyroid display tracker. 

Like maybe because Brewster is to busy to go find them running the cafe now. So he sets up a wall in the cafe to display the collection you bring to him.

Maybe he can give you extra special coffee recipes you can cary and place around for your trouble.  Chocolate chip frap.  Carmel heck maybe boba and tea recipes. 

Then oh I would love if blathers and Brewster got to talking. Maybe blathers had to stay up during the day and grabbed coffee. Admired the collection. 

Mentions a monthly exhibit. 

 Maybe you would have to collect the random pieces to build one special guy a month or something and it gets featured as the exhibit piece. This way there is always something new after you found them all. 

It would also be cool if there was a mine or way to find gems, rocks to make paints or other fancy items.  Just more things to collect or use for diy possibilities. 

Maybe the thing keeping blathers awake was some mysteries pitfal seed. Reset finds out that only once a day sends you to an underground random area and you can mine and forage glowing plants.  Kinda like the islands just skinned different and underground. He can help you while there. 

I dream a bit to much lmao. 

But more things to craft and cook 

More things to find gather for the above.

More collabs with official stores. Mainly for more decorating and story telling options less for branded merch. 

It would be so cool to see the items the companies and normal people come up with. Maybe acnh has a sort of here are the 3d models.  Design something and most voted by community wins. Kinda like Lego. 

Side expansion would be pocket camp additions in game.  Can you imagine the giant fairy furniture!   I can’t remember if it lets you park your pocket camp van on acnh photo island. But that would be cool.  

Some sort of road trip options maybe to go antiquing with reese and it pulls random furniture from pocket camp. 

  
Honestly endless.  

Do you think if we ask nicely with sugar they would add more features to the next one lmao",3,1769628799.0,AnimalCrossing,1,1.0,False

1qplf4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidMen/comments/1qplf4w/how_to_stay_attractive_in_longterm_relationships/,How to Stay Attractive in Long-Term Relationships: The UNSEXY Truth Nobody Wants to Hear,"

Okay so here's the thing nobody talks about. We're obsessed with ""how to get the guy/girl"" but completely clueless about keeping that spark alive once you're actually IN the relationship. I've been digging through relationship research, evolutionary psychology studies, attachment theory books, and honestly? Most of what we think we know is completely backwards.

The uncomfortable truth is that our brains are literally wired to get bored. Novelty releases dopamine. Familiarity doesn't. So when that initial obsession fades (and it WILL fade, usually around 12-18 months according to biological anthropologist Helen Fisher), most people panic and think the relationship is dying. But that's actually when the real work begins.

Here's what actually keeps attraction alive long term, backed by research and not just recycled dating advice:

1. Maintain your own identity aggressively

The fastest way to become unattractive is to merge into one boring blob. Psychologist Esther Perel talks about this in ""Mating in Captivity"" (best relationship book that exists, fight me on this). She explains that desire needs distance. You can't want what you already have completely.

Keep your hobbies. Keep your friend groups. Keep pursuing your own goals. When you come back together you actually have interesting things to share. You become a person worth being curious about again instead of someone they already know everything about.

The app Paired is weirdly good for this btw. It sends daily questions that help you realize your partner is still changing and evolving. Costs like $10/month but way cheaper than couples therapy.

2. Unpredictability is your secret weapon

Our brains habituate to everything. That's why the good morning text that made you smile for 6 months suddenly feels like white noise. Researcher Arthur Aron found that couples who regularly tried novel activities together reported significantly higher relationship quality.

This doesn't mean you need to go skydiving every weekend. It means breaking patterns. If you always have netflix dates, go to a pottery class. If you always split bills, randomly treat them. If you always text goodnight, call instead. Small unpredictable positive behaviors trigger dopamine.

Break your own patterns too. Change your style occasionally. Develop a new skill. The version of you from 2 years ago shouldn't be identical to current you.

3. Sexual attraction needs actual effort

We've been sold this lie that sexual chemistry should just ""happen naturally"" if you're with the right person. Completely false according to sex researcher Emily Nagoski. She wrote ""Come As You Are"" and it's genuinely eye opening about how responsive desire works (especially for women but honestly for everyone).

Desire in long term relationships is often responsive, not spontaneous. Meaning you won't randomly feel horny for your partner the way you did at month 3. You have to create contexts where desire can emerge. That means flirting throughout the day. Building tension. Not treating your partner like a roommate who you occasionally have sex with.

Also physical touch that ISN'T always sexual. The gottman institute found that couples who maintain non sexual physical affection (holding hands, random hugs, touching while talking) report better sex lives. It maintains that physical connection baseline.

4. How you fight determines everything

Conflict is inevitable. Everyone knows this. But most people are absolute trash at handling it. Psychologist John Gottman can predict with 90% accuracy whether a couple will divorce based on how they argue. His research identified four toxic patterns he calls the four horsemen: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, stonewalling.

The couples who stay attracted long term? They fight about the issue, not the person. They take breaks when flooded. They make repair attempts (""hey i'm being an asshole, can we restart this""). They assume good intentions.

When you feel truly seen and respected even during disagreements, that's deeply attractive. When someone makes you feel like shit about yourself, attraction dies fast.

The book ""Hold Me Tight"" by Dr Sue Johnson breaks down attachment patterns in relationships. It's based on emotionally focused therapy which has like 75% success rates. Insanely good read if you keep having the same stupid fights.

If you want to go deeper on relationship psychology but don't have the energy to read through all these books and studies, there's an app called BeFreed that's been genuinely useful. It's a personalized learning platform that pulls from relationship books, research papers, and expert insights to create custom audio content based on your specific situation. You can set a goal like ""maintaining attraction as someone in a 3-year relationship"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan pulling from sources like Perel, Gottman, and Nagoski. 

The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples when you want more context. Plus you can pick different voices, including this smoky one that makes even attachment theory sound less academic. Way more digestible than trying to get through multiple relationship books while commuting or doing laundry.

5. You can't outsource your happiness

This is the least sexy advice but the most important. If you need your partner to make you feel attractive, worthy, happy, or fulfilled, the relationship is already in trouble. That's way too much pressure on another human.

People are most attractive when they're genuinely content with themselves. Not in a toxic positivity way but in a ""i like my life and you enhance it"" way versus ""you ARE my life"" way.

Invest in your mental health. The app Bloom is actually solid for relationship anxiety and attachment stuff if you're not ready for therapy. Therapy is obviously better though.

6. Nostalgia is underrated

Researcher Clay Routledge found that nostalgia strengthens relationships by reinforcing shared identity and meaning. Couples who regularly reminisce about positive memories and early relationship experiences report higher satisfaction.

Keep a shared photo album. Revisit places from early in your relationship. Talk about how you've grown together. Reference inside jokes. These aren't just cute gestures, they're literally reinforcing your bond and reminding both of you why you chose each other.

7. Appreciate out loud constantly

We stop expressing appreciation once we get comfortable. Huge mistake. Psychologist Sara Algoe's research on gratitude in relationships found that expressing appreciation not only makes your partner feel valued but actually makes YOU notice more positive things about them.

Say the obvious stuff. ""I love how you always remember my coffee order."" ""You looked really attractive when you were focused on that project earlier."" ""I appreciate you listening to me vent about work.""

Specificity matters. ""You're great"" means less than ""the way you handled that situation with patience was really impressive.""

Look, maintaining attraction long term isn't about tricks or games. It's about continuously choosing to see your partner as a separate interesting person rather than an extension of yourself or a character in your life story who's supposed to act a certain way.

The relationships that stay hot are between two people who keep evolving individually while building something together. Distance and closeness. Independence and intimacy. That tension is where attraction lives.",1,1769628706.0,SolidMen,1,1.0,False

Got a really great response to a post I made recently, then I got suspended for speaking facts to Nazis. Fun times on reddit! Figured I’d post again but with a bit more clarity on what I’m looking for:

1. Writer/directors to collaborate on a few high-quality, no-budget short films

2. DP's / Lighting / Sound / Post for various projects

3. Trained, repped actors in NYC to help read for each other’s tv/film auditions in person

4. Experienced comedy actor/writers interested in starting a sketch comedy group (Key & Peel, Kids in The Hall, Peter Serafinowicz etc.)

I’m a classically trained actor based in Astoria with good rep. & a few credits on major tv shows, over 300+ auditions for SAG tv/film, for very cool stuff like The Chair Company, The Agency, Once Upon a Time In Hollywood sequel, etc. My 1st short I wrote/directed was a police corruption conspiracy. My next two are a psychological thriller & horror fable. Biggest influences are Fincher, anything HBO, Fargo, Prestige Drama, Dark Comedies, experimental stuff done tastefully.

If you’re interested, shoot me a DM with a link to your reel / website + email + availability over the next 2 weeks & we can set up a time to grab coffee & touch base!

1qplcfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1qplcfb/atelier_review/,Atelier Review,"My fiancé and I went to Atelier for 5 nights earlier this month. It’s recommended a ton on this sub so I wanted to share our experience.

Background: We don’t do AIs, neither of us have been to one since we were teenagers. We are a late-20s couple in NYC, and we have travelled a lot, from nice hotels to cheap hostels all over the world. So we don’t know a lot about AIs but are generally super flexible; however we do expect a lot when we’re spending a lot. We took this trip to celebrate our engagement.

We chose to do the lowest cost option, a 2 double room (queen beds), no view, no Inspira.

Check-in: I was quoted like $275 or something crazy for an airport transfer by Atelier. Ended up booking with USA transfers for $125 round trip. Did feel like Atelier was trying to rip me off here. Then, trying to get us to agree to a “breakfast” with a rep for Inspira immediately upon check-in is insane. Otherwise, check in was quick and smooth. The guy at reception mentioned they were extremely busy currently (this was the week after NYE). But it honestly didn’t feel too busy during our time there - huge plus.

Crowd: We expected the crowd to skew older and more couples because of the price and it being a nicer AI in Cancun. It felt like most people were from the South. There were definitely couples, but a ton of girls trips/big groups of couples, as well as families with grown children. The age ranged a lot, but there didn’t seem to be many people under 25 without their parents. People were dressed a bit more nicely than I expected for dinner/bars which was lovely.

Room: The room was big. The bath tub was huge, and everything was extremely clean. They cleaned well each morning and had turn down service in the evening. There’s coffee, beer, water, and

candy in the room for free. Room service is included. We only ordered it for breakfast and it wasn’t very good, but I wish we’d tried it the night menu. We were in building 3 which is a bit of a walk from the main pool and beach but it was totally fine.

Drinks: The drinks were inconsistent. You’d get a totally different drink from different bartenders at the same bar one after another. And even more inconsistent when comparing one bar to another. Many of the drinks felt pretty light on alcohol. However not a ton to complain about, they did the job and generally tasted decent. They do include top shelf liquor.

Beach: We didn’t sit on the beach that much because it was a little windy when we were there. The sargassum didn’t smell. There were usually more chairs available later at the beach than the pool. Inspira had its own section but we didn’t have fomo over it at all.

Pool: We didn’t spend much time at the quiet pool because it was far from the beach. The regular pool wasn’t rowdy, and inside the pool was never weirdly crowded. The servers were generally quite good, though if we sat between 2 large groups they kinda forgot about us. So most of days we grabbed a Bali bed, which are first come first serve (I’m an early riser girl, so I’d grab a seat at 6am, workout, and be back on the bed after breakfast around 730 when the sun came up). I don’t like the towel game but it’s just what you have to do here unfortunately. Dont be the person who leaves their shit there and disappears for hours. Most chairs were taken by 8/830. The beds were usually taken by about 7:30. One thing that was annoying was we overheard the morning and afternoon towel guys talking to the people on the bed next to us and apparently the morning towel guy “reserved” the bed for them each day by putting his own book and hat on it before 6am. I guess they tipped him for that. I thought that was kind of annoying bc it was against hotel policy of not reserving chairs but it is what it is. Sit on the side closer to the hotel if you want sun; the other side stays in the shade for the most part. The pool food was good for pool food, we loved the bao buns.

Gym: The gym was crowded! It was NY resolution time, but it was crowded by like 7am most days, and more crowded in the later morning. It was large with a good amount of machines, and they had fitness classes but we didn’t try any.

Food: As I said, we don’t do AIs, but I knew the food could only be so good. Everyone raves about the food here, but even with mild expectations I felt mixed. The Italian place was fine, everything was edible. The Mediterranean place was pretty good. The Asian place was terrible. We didn’t try the Japanese. The steakhouse was as good as I’d imagine an AI can be for steak. We had the food at the quiet pool and it was okay. We heard the buffet in Building 3 was bad so we didn’t go there. And then we didn’t really wanna go to the Mexican place Mercado 19 for dinner since that’s where we were having the breakfast buffet everyday, but the breakfast honestly was some of the best stuff I was having (the quesadilla station yum), so we went to the Mexican Party buffet night and that was our fav meal there. We also went another time for their regular dinner which wasn’t as amazing but still very good. We also liked the taco cart that would park outside La Calle every night. I wish Atelier would lean into the Mexican food more because it’s good and we’re in Mexico, and why are there no tacos or quesadillas available for lunch!! It seems like it’d be an easy pick. They did have little carts with ice cream or tacos come by the pool sometimes which we loved. Maybe I’m not realistic about AIs but overall the food was just kinda hit or miss for me. It didn’t ruin our trip or anything, but I think it could be improved.

Service: Generally, the service was good. The room was very clean. The bartenders were attentive. The servers at the pool were hustling. We never really had to wait for a drink or food or anything. The only person who didn’t provide good service was the towel guy at the pool - we always tipped him when we asked for a towel ($2-5) or when he set up our chairs with towels ($5-10+) so I’m not sure why he didn’t like us but he wasn’t pleasant. It did feel like you had to tip to get good service. We’d usually tip when we started a service (sat at the bar or pool or whatever) and then again before we left, but in the middle it felt like they sometimes started to ignore us if they thought we had stopped tipping. We spent about $300 in cash while there.

Inspira: I didn’t want to spend all this money and feel like a second class citizen because we hadn’t upgraded. This was my biggest concern/hope when we chose Atelier. We didn’t feel like we missed out AT ALL by not upgrading to Inspira. If you have a big group, the swim out room is probably fun. But for us we didn’t really think of it. We weren’t jealous of the rooftop pool, because it was a little chilly up there. We didn’t care about getting a shorter walk or reserved seating at the beach or the extra bar because it just didn’t seem that much better than the regular stuff. It would’ve been cool to get free sunscreen and have the Michelin restaurant included but def not enough to spend all the extra money. So if you’re on the fence I’d definitely say to skip the upgrade.",6,1769628546.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,0.8,False

1qpl971,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1qpl971/how_to_be_the_fun_person_in_the_room_the/,How to Be the Fun Person in the Room: The Psychology That Actually Works (Without Trying Too Hard),"I've been studying social dynamics for years now, devouring everything from improv comedy techniques to behavioural psychology research, and honestly? Most advice about ""being fun"" is garbage. It tells you to be loud, tell jokes, and be the centre of attention. But the genuinely fun people I know? They're not performing. They're doing something way more interesting.

Here's what actually works, backed by research and real-world observation:

Stop equating ""fun"" with ""entertaining""

The biggest trap is thinking you need to be a clown. Research from Stanford's Social Psychological Answers to Real-world Questions Lab shows that people who are perceived as ""fun"" are actually skilled at elevating others, not themselves. They make everyone around them feel more interesting, more confident, more alive.

Think about it. The person everyone wants at the party isn't always the loudest one. It's the one who makes you feel like the best version of yourself.

Cultivate genuine curiosity about literally everything.

Fun people ask unexpected questions. Not the boring ""what do you do?"" but stuff like ""what's the weirdest thing that happened to you this week?"" or ""if you could only eat one cuisine forever, what's your pick and why?""

The Art of Gathering by Priya Parker (bestselling author featured in NYT, expert on meaningful connection) breaks this down beautifully. She explains how the best gatherings happen when someone creates ""generous authority,"" basically permitting people to be more themselves. This book completely changed how I approach social situations. It's not about being the star; it's about creating the right atmosphere. Best book on human connection I've read in years.

Master the energy match then lift

Here's something I learned from improv: match people's energy first, THEN gradually lift it. If someone's telling a quiet story, don't bulldoze in with loud energy. Meet them where they are, show you're listening, then slowly bring more enthusiasm.

Dr Brené Brown talks about this in her research on connection: you can't force joy onto people. You invite them into it.

Develop your ""yes, and"" muscle.

Improv's golden rule. Whatever someone says, build on it instead of shutting it down. Someone mentions they had terrible coffee this morning? Instead of ""oh that sucks,"" try ""terrible how? Like burnt terrible or just weak and sad?"" Suddenly, you're in a conversation about the philosophy of bad coffee, and everyone's laughing about their worst cafe experiences.

Have a vault of weird knowledge

Fun people know random shit. They've watched a documentary about cheese caves, listened to a podcast about space trash, and read an article about why we're all breathing in Cleopatra's breath (it's true, look it up).

Radiolab podcast is PERFECT for this. Jad Abumrad and Robert Krulwich make science and philosophy genuinely fascinating. You'll have endless conversation starters that aren't boring small talk. Their episode on colour blew my mind, and I've referenced it at parties more times than I can count.

If you want a more structured way to build this knowledge vault without spending hours hunting for content, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI learning app that pulls from books, research, expert interviews, and podcasts to create personalised audio content based on what you're curious about. Type in something like ""become more magnetic in social situations as an introvert"", and it builds an adaptive learning plan just for you, drawing from psychology research and communication experts. You can customise the depth, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples, and even pick your narrator's voice (some are surprisingly engaging). It connects a lot of the dots between social psychology, improv techniques, and real-world application, which helps when you're trying to internalise this stuff naturally rather than just memorising tips.

Practice strategic vulnerability

Sharing something slightly embarrassing or weird about yourself permits others to do the same. And THAT'S when things get fun. Not forced vulnerability, just being real.

""I tried making sourdough during lockdown, and it looked like a science experiment gone wrong"" is way more fun than ""I'm really into artisan bread making.""

Become a hype person.

Genuinely celebrate other people's wins, even small ones. Someone finally tried that restaurant they've been talking about? Get excited with them. Your friend made a dumb pun? Laugh genuinely if it's actually funny.

Social psychologist Dr John Gottman's research on relationships found that responding enthusiastically to good news is one of the strongest predictors of relationship quality. Works for friendships too.

Develop playful challenge skills.

Lightly teasing people in a way that's clearly affectionate, not mean. Throwing out playful challenges. ""I bet you can't name three Taylor Swift songs"" or ""there's NO way you've actually read that entire book."" Keeps things lively without being aggressive.

For social anxiety

If social situations stress you out (they do for most of us), Finch is a genuinely helpful self-care app. It gamifies building confidence and managing anxiety through this cute bird companion. Sounds silly, but it actually helps you track what social situations drain you vs energise you, so you can show up better.

Stop trying to be funny, start trying to be interesting.

Comedian Pete Holmes talks about this. Funny people aren't trying to be funny; they're just genuinely delighted by the absurdity of life and willing to point it out.

Notice weird stuff. The way your friend pronounces ""aluminium."" How every meeting could've been an email. The absurdity of small talk about the weather. Just notice it out loud.

Embrace the pause

Silence isn't your enemy. Sometimes the funniest thing is just letting an awkward moment breathe. Comfortable with silence? You're automatically more fun because you're not desperately filling space with noise.

Build a thing people can contribute to

Start a running joke. Create a Spotify playlist everyone adds to. Have a shared Google doc of terrible date stories. Fun people create containers that others can pour themselves into.

Bottom line: being fun isn't a personality transplant. It's just being present, curious, and making people feel good. The research backs this up; human connection happens when we feel seen and elevated, not entertained.

You don't need to be ""on"" all the time. You just need to be genuinely interested in the humans around you and willing to play a little. That's it. That's the whole thing.

1qpl861,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexlessmarriage/comments/1qpl861/lesbian_bed_death/,Lesbian bed death,"Hello!

My wife (LLF) and I (HLF) have had a DB since shortly after we were married 7 years ago. We are in our late 30s and have one child who is 6. No medical issues.

The last time we were intimate was in August. Once, while our child was on vacation with grandparents for a week.

We are both full-time working professionals but have a very family friendly work schedule. On the outside, we have a lovely life. Great careers, nice home, spend lots of family time together, travel & so on.

Since my job is more flexible than hers, I do most of the housework inside & out. I clean, perform maintenance, cook a majority of the meals, and all of the planning that comes with it. Lawn care, snow, etc. I take care of it. She takes care of laundry and school lunches exclusively. I don’t mind this, as it works for us. I only say this because her physical/mental load at home is not heavy & isn’t the reason for our DB which I know can be the case in some relationships.

I think of the small things. I’ll get her coffee ready, switch her bath towel, fix her something to eat when she’s in between meetings. I’ll clean the snow off her car and warm it up before she has to leave, shovel her a path to her car door first.

Any “talks” about our DB turn into her becoming defensive and angry & she just waits for me to be out of the funk I’m in until the next time I can’t push the emotions down.

Me: “I feel like I just exist for you, and am not seen or prioritized.” Or “I feel like you are not in love with me” or “I am deeply lonely” and every other feeling you can imagine that comes with a DB. A lot of it is me asking why? What is wrong with me?

Her responses: “oh great you’re at it again because you’re trying to initiate, I’m saying no like I always do because I have no interest in doing that, and you start getting bitchy and angry with everyone” (I don’t, I just sometimes retreat into myself and become quiet/a woman of few words - which is “bitchy” to her)

Or “I have nothing to fix. If you are unhappy then make yourself happy, stop trying to make me feel like shit”

All of this leads me to conclude that I don’t matter to her and if I can’t accept her lack of desire, I should leave as she refuses to see it as an issue and work towards a resolution. 

I don’t know what else to do. She has this wall up and it’s indestructible.

I’m looking for advice from people who’ve studied for the MCAT with very limited time and a life that doesn’t slow down.

I’m 27 and planning to apply to medical school \*\*hopefully\*\* next cycle, assuming I can get the MCAT figured out. I work full time in a clinical/research role at an academic medical center and also have a second job on Sundays (coffee shop, money is tight). I volunteer one evening a week at a night clinic as well.

Time wise, Saturdays are basically my only consistent study day. Weekdays are unpredictable because my job is demanding and I often get pulled away unexpectedly. I’m open to studying in the evenings, but I’m trying to be realistic about burnout since I also want to keep up with basics like working out, cooking, etc. Sleeping is negotiable lol. I’m happy to sacrifice things temporarily but I want to do this in a semi-sustainable way.

My biggest worry is content overwhelm. When I try to study (especially for chemistry and physics), I realize I’m missing some foundational knowledge, which makes it hard to even know where to start. It feels like the MCAT assumes a baseline I don’t fully have anymore, and that’s been pretty discouraging. Relatively speaking, I do feel comfortable with most of the other sections.

I’m not aiming for a super high score. Realistically, my goal is to break 500. I’m planning to test around May 2026. I’m applying to the institution where I currently work and also trained for my MPH, and I know they take a holistic approach. I’ve even seen people get in with sub 500 scores. Still, I’m anxious about underpreparing or wasting time studying inefficiently.

I currently have anki, khan academy, and am considering UWorld, but I’m struggling with how to use them effectively when I don’t have a solid daily study routine, if I can ever develop one haha

In short, these are my questions:

1) Has anyone here successfully studied for the MCAT while working full time (or multiple jobs)?

2)Is it realistic to prep over a few months with Saturdays as the main study day plus short weekday sessions?

3) How did you rebuild content foundations without getting totally overwhelmed?

4) Any tips for staying consistent when your schedule is unpredictable?

I’m motivated, just anxious and trying to be realistic about what’s doable. I have put this off for way too long and it’s the last box I have to check on my med school journey. I’d really appreciate any advice or experiences.

I just wanted to share a few barely useful tips, without specific order or usefulness :

**A-** While looking a the full list of dwellers (vault door icon top left) if you select by **Job**, the unemployed (**Coffee Break**) dwellers will be at the top, then the ones in Living quarters.

At the bottom of the list you'll have children with the time estimated before their '*adultation*', and the ones in the **Vault door**.

**B-** When on a quest from the **Overseer office** or random wasteland ones, when you are ready to leave you have three options to do so :

1. Icon on top right, 
2. Drag one dweller to the outside of the building, 
3. Simply Tap the exterior.

**C-** I always put three **Living quarters** below the vault door, at level 1-2-3, level 3 being the first after the elevator. Useful when people return from outside / temp station before going out. They will appear on top of the dweller list (see A) Beware not putting couples in there, they get frisky quick.

**D-** When in the **exterior view** (tapping / clicking outside the vault) you can change the dweller either by : 

1. using the ***>*** top right, 
2. swiping left of right on specific parts but not buttons. Anywhere when showing quest dwellers, 
3. swiping between the stims/radaway and advance/recall button and on the dweller itself.

**E-** If you have preferred dwellers you want to quickly check on, add a \* \^ $ etc. at the beginning of their name \^Lucy, they will show up on top of the list when sorting by name.

**F-** When on quests, shiny containers can be openend even if your dwellers are not in the same room. Dead ennemies require to be in the same room.

**G-** You can ""store"" your dwellers in storage areas without them getting experience, but they'll look like they are busy and not slacking at all.

**H-** When in a fight (quest / random encounter) you can target specific ennemy either by draggin the dweller onto it, or tapping the dweller and tapping the ennemy. 

**I-** Unless you are desperate for a little money of need to complete a scpecifi objective, the **Mysterious Stranger** mini-game is useless and will give you **PTSD** when your vault gets bigger. I do now. The sound is traumatising...

**J-** Intercourse increases happiness, use this information as you wish, ingame or not.

**K-** While in the wasteland, you cannot throw away useless stuff. That is stupid.

**L-** Looks can be deceiving. An **E+7** mended cloth suit will protect you more than a full suit of power armor.

**M-** Always keep stupid useless weapons in storage (knives, pool cues, pickaxes...) in case the devs want to send you on an horribly long and tedious quest. If you don't have them, you'll have to build them.

**N-** Close inbreeding is ok, unless too close. European Monarchies style.

**O-** You WILL level-up dweller wether you like it or not, because tapping the screen for other purposes does NOT prenvent you to do so.

**P-** Ennemies in the vaul WILL take the longest route possible when agonising and deplete your ressources while you watch in despair. That frustration is intended.

1qpl5ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1qpl5ss/5_problems_introverts_deal_with_that_no_one_talks/,5 Problems Introverts Deal With (That No One Talks About),"

So I've been digging into research about introversion for months now, reading everything from Susan Cain's work to neuroscience papers, and honestly? Most advice for introverts is garbage. It's either  just be more social!  or  embrace your quiet nature!  which helps exactly no one.

Here's what I learned from actual research, psychology podcasts, and way too many hours on YouTube: being introverted isn't about being shy or antisocial. It's literally about how your brain processes dopamine and stimulation differently. Your nervous system gets overwhelmed faster than extroverts. That's biology, not a personality flaw.

But society? Society is built for extroverts. And that creates some very specific problems that most people don't understand.

**The  social hangover  is real and brutal**

After social events, you feel completely drained, sometimes for DAYS. This isn't laziness. Dr. Marti Olsen Laney explains in  The Introvert Advantage  that introverts use more acetylcholine pathways in their brains, which is longer and more complex than the dopamine pathways extroverts rely on. Translation: your brain literally works harder during social interaction.

What helps: planned recovery time. Block off the day after big social events. No guilt, no apologies. I started using the Finch app to track my energy levels and it's weirdly helpful for understanding your patterns. It's like a little self care companion that doesn't judge when you need three hours alone after a dinner party.

**People think you're mad/rude/stuck up when you're just... existing**

Your resting face apparently screams  leave me alone  even when you're perfectly content. People constantly ask  are you ok?  or  why are you so quiet?  which somehow makes YOU feel like the weird one.

Brené Brown talks about this in her podcast Unlocking Us, how introverts often get mislabeled as aloof when they're actually just conserving energy. The constant explaining gets exhausting.

Real talk: you don't owe anyone an explanation for your natural state. Practice saying  I'm good, just processing  or honestly just  yeah I'm quiet sometimes.  Most people will get over it.

**Networking and  putting yourself out there  feels like actual torture**

Every career advice article ever:  network! attend events! be visible!  Cool, but what if that sounds worse than a root canal?

The book  Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking  by Susan Cain (she's like the godmother of introvert research, TED talk has 30 million views) breaks down why traditional networking is designed for extroverts. She won the research, she's got the receipts.

Better approach: one on one coffee chats. Online communities. Email connections. LinkedIn actually works great for introverts because you can think before responding. The podcast The Introvert Entrepreneur by Beth Buelow has insanely good strategies for this. She gets that you can build a career without becoming someone you're not.

**Small talk makes you want to dissolve into the floor**

Oh god the WEATHER TALK. The endless superficial conversations that feel like they're sucking your soul out through your ears. Meanwhile everyone else seems fine with it?

Here's the thing: introverts crave depth, not breadth. Research shows your brains are literally wired for deeper processing. That's from studies done by Dr. Colin DeYoung at the University of Minnesota on personality neuroscience.

Hack: have 2-3 deeper questions ready to redirect small talk.  What's been the best part of your week?  works way better than  how about this weather huh.  The YouTube channel Charisma on Command has a whole video on this that's actually not cringe.

Also? The app Ash is basically a pocket therapist that helps you work through social anxiety and conversation struggles. It's like having coaching available at 2am when you're overthinking that awkward interaction from 6 hours ago.

**Your energy budget is smaller and people don't get it**

You have to pick between groceries, seeing friends, or work drinks because you literally cannot do all three in one day. Then people act like you're flaky or don't care.

Your energy is finite and recharges differently. That's not being difficult, that's knowing your limits. The Overwhelmed Brain podcast by Paul Colaianni talks about this, about how honoring your actual capacity isn't selfish, it's necessary.

Start treating your energy like money. You have a budget. Some things cost more than others. A loud birthday party costs way more than a quiet dinner with two friends. Budget accordingly and stop apologizing for it.

The book  The Secret Lives of Introverts  by Jenn Granneman goes deep into this energy management thing. She founded the whole Introvert, Dear community and this book will make you feel SO seen. 

If you want something more structured that actually adapts to your specific struggles as an introvert, there's an app called BeFreed that pulls from psychology research, books like the ones mentioned here, and expert insights to create personalized learning plans. You tell it your goal, something like  become more confident in social settings as an introvert,  and it generates audio content tailored to you. You can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are genuinely addictive, there's even a sarcastic narrator if you're into that. It connects dots across different sources so you're not just getting random advice, but actual strategies that build on each other.

Look, the world isn't going to suddenly accommodate introversion. But understanding the actual science behind why you are the way you are? That changes everything. You're not broken or antisocial or boring. Your brain just processes the world differently, and honestly that's usually an advantage once you stop trying to be someone else.",1,1769628152.0,ArtOfPresence,1,1.0,False

In the same exact spot a new Ramen restaurant has  had a soft open, Toki Ramen & Sushi. My mother and I who used to frequent Ajinoya decided to give it a try. The gyoza where light and delicious. The dipping sauce was amazing!


I ordered the Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen and my mother the Spicy Miso and both were amazing, just as good as Ajinoya! 


The one disappointment was that the ramen did not come with a Ramen Egg. Also no Japanese iced coffee,  butthe egg was the bigger disappointment.


The gentleman who served us was, I believe the owner, and he lets us know as part of the soft opening they are taking customer feed back at this time and will adjust the menu accordingly. So please if you go let them know you want the ramen egg too!! Apparently they owned a Ramen restaurant up north and no one ate the egg, utterly insane! 


The owner let us know before opening the restaurant he and his family traveled Japan trying all the Ramen they could!


They also took off one of out apppatizers if we followed them on tiktok or instagram, which was very nice! 


The restaurant itself was the same exact layout as Ajinoya just with slightly more upscale decor.


The price was similar to Ajinoya, so affordable!


So yes I am happy to say that Toki Ramen & Sushi is a proper and right successor to Ajinoya Ramen!

I’m an experienced traveler, enjoy long walking days, and my goal is to see as much as possible while also eating my way through the city. I usually plan sightseeing from 8 am to 10 pm. I’ll be staying in a hotel in Sultanahmet.

I’d love feedback from locals and frequent visitors:

Does this itinerary make sense logistically?

Would you change the order of anything?

Am I missing something important or very Istanbul-specific?

Is it worth buying attraction tickets online in advance?

***Food plan (Day 1):***

* simit + tea for breakfast

I’m visiting in late February / early March, so I expect cooler weather and shorter days — but I’m fine with that.

Does this feel realistic for someone who likes packed days? Would you personally skip or replace anything? Any must-eat dishes or neighborhoods I should absolutely add?

1qpl1zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/postpartumprogress/comments/1qpl1zz/tipsfeedback_for_maximizing_my_exercise_routine/,"Tips/feedback for maximizing my exercise routine for efficiency, toning and muscle building?","Background: I (28F) am currently 9 months postpartum from a pregnancy where I had some pretty rough sciatica, pelvic girdle pain, headaches and nausea - I went from 160lbs to 216lbs at delivery (I am 5’6). I lost the initial pregnancy 20lbs within about 2 months after giving birth, and lost another 33 to be at around 163lbs by 9 months postpartum. I lost most muscle and fitness base. After getting cleared at 6 weeks, I did 5 mile walks multiple times a week while baby carrying, rollerbladed with my dogs frequently, did some spin classes, and started dipping my toes back into running. I went back to work at the end of summer which basically removed the long walks/rollerblading, so my routine for 5 months has been either running or the below. I also exclusively pumped for 8 months as well which probably helped with some calorie leniency? 

Prior to getting pregnant I did long distance running as my primary fitness that fluctuated on if I was in a marathon training block or not. Since my 6 week appt I’ve been more consistent than ever with exercise but less intense with activity swings so more of a steady state fitness level.

My current situation: I live in a cold climate with early sunsets right now, a 7 pm baby bed time to run point on (if not doing the bedtime then im probably doing dinner and cleaning stuff after a workout - my husband and I jump in wherever one of us is needed in the moment) and work full time. I’ve been really regimented with ensuring I get 4 days per week of workouts (this amount feels maintainable) — 2 I do on lunch break when I work from home those days, 2 I do in a chaotic stressful time block after daycare pickup/before baby goes to bed. I am not a morning workout person and I’m hesitant to run with my dogs/run outside with a high risk of eating the pavement on ice lol. I’ve run through winters before but dont want to break a bone in this life season lol. 

Goals: 

\- lose another 10-15 lbs (the scale has not moved in weeks!!)

\- be kind of a muscle mommy without compromising my love for cardio

\- lose the rest of the mom pouch 

\- do it all with limited time (3-4 hours a week for workouts, I like a 4 day routine for the menty heath)

Equipment I have: 

\- an assault/airbike (treadmjll broke and the bike was free lol)

\- 30lb kettlebell 

\- 5lb dumbbell set 

\- 10 lb dumbbell set 

\- 15 lb dumbbell set 

\- yoga mat 

Willing to buy more essentials but can’t take up a ton of room and would prefer not to spend a ton. 

Routine: 

4 days per week of: 12-15 miles on the assault bike at around a 18-19mph pace. The last 2-3 miles, I pedal while doing arm exercises - presses/curls/rows/extensions with 10lb dumbbells. This usually takes me between 40-50 minutes. If I have the time, I do another 10-12 minutes off the bike of squats, compound lifts or whatever with the 15lb weights or 30lb dumbbells to get to an hour. 

Im happiest when doing cardio so Im looking for tips for the most bang for your buck routine that still has longer cardio elements. I feel like this routine is working fine but im hoping someone with more gym experience, less running for mental health not speed, to tell me how to improve aesthetically lol

Average day diet: 

I am for 5 servings fruits/veggies daily

\- smoothie in morning with greek yogurt/protein powder/fruit/chia seeds (probs 300 calories, 30g protein) 

\- couple of coffees with oat milk and cream (I defs overdo it on caffeine but also sleep fine so ah well)

\- lunch is usually some cheese sticks, meat sticks or deli meat, fruits, a protein bar 

\- dinner is usually a grain or carb and veg combo, sometimes meat. Whatever is quick 

\- end of day calories probably range from 1600-2200 and protein between 50-80g

Questions: 

\- I quit pumping at 8 months pp, is this causing my weight to stall out? It hasn’t moved in a few weeks. I tracked enough calories in my previous life to have a decent grasp on what I consume in a day, and am also back on adhd medication that limits appetite, so I’m very confused? I have also had the flu and rsv this month but have worked out mostly through these illnesses and diet the same??

\- Is an assault bike more effective for some muscle building than running? Will this demon of a cardio machine keep toning me? 

\- DOES THE MOM POUCH EVER GO AWAY 

\- bonus question for me of the future in 1-3 years: did getting back into great shape make you scared to get pregnant and do it again?? Was it harder the second time?  Will I even have time to care with multiple kiddo? I feel like I’ve worked SO hard to get to where I’m at right now. I know I want another baby in the future, and am terrified of gaining that much weight again and doing this all over. Obviously, my babe is worth all of it and more, but while being the best mom I can be I also want to be my best self.

If you read this far, thank you <3. I’m just feeling the overwhelmed “how do I do it all”, living and dying by the routines, and waning to feel/look not like the me before pregnancy but even better if it’s possible and always want other moms tips and tricks to getting the wins.

Your brain releases dopamine during new experiences. early relationships are flooded with this because everything is novel. after years together, your brain gets efficient and stops releasing as much. this isn't your relationship failing, it's basic neurobiology.

The fix isn't ""date nights"" at the same restaurant. it's genuine novelty. Dr. Arthur Aron's research (the guy behind the famous 36 questions study) found that couples who regularly do novel, challenging activities together report significantly higher relationship satisfaction. we're talking rock climbing, learning pottery, exploring random neighborhoods, taking cooking classes for cuisines neither of you know.

I started using an app called Paired for relationship growth. it's basically duolingo but for your relationship. daily questions, research backed exercises, conversation starters that go beyond ""how was work."" the questions get weirdly specific and intimate in ways that force actual discovery. been using it for 6 months and holy shit, you realize how many assumptions you've been making about your partner.

**maintenance sex is real and necessary**

Esther Perel's ""[Mating in Captivity](https://www.amazon.com/Mating-Captivity-Unlocking-Erotic-Intelligence/dp/0060753641)"" completely changed how i think about long term intimacy. (she's literally THE authority on modern relationships, been featured everywhere from TED to therapy conferences worldwide. this book will make you question everything you think you know about desire and domesticity.)

Her main point: desire needs space and mystery. when you know everything about someone, share a bathroom, coordinate grocery lists... eroticism struggles. you need to occasionally see your partner as separate from you, not just your domestic co-manager.

Practical stuff that works: maintain separate interests and friend groups. have experiences apart that you come back and share. stop treating your partner like a sibling you share chores with. create intentional distance sometimes (not emotional walls, but like... don't text them every mundane thought). desire often shows up in the space between.

The ""maintenance sex"" concept means sometimes you initiate even when you're not naturally horny. sounds unromantic but it's actually the opposite. it signals ""i'm choosing to prioritize our intimate connection over my comfort zone."" and bodies are weird, arousal often follows action rather than preceding it.

**the gottman method isn't boring, it's just accurate**

John Gottman can predict divorce with 90% accuracy after watching couples argue for 15 minutes. his research spanning 40+ years identified specific patterns that kill relationships.

The most important one: contempt. not anger, not disagreement, but contempt (eye rolling, mockery, defensive sarcasm, character attacks). it's the single biggest predictor of breakup. once you start viewing your partner with contempt, you're basically done unless you intervene hard.

His ""magic ratio"" is 5:1 positive to negative interactions. for every criticism or conflict, you need five positive moments. sounds simple but most long term couples operate at like 1:1 at best.

Small daily connections matter more than grand gestures. he calls them ""bids for connection."" your partner mentions something random, that's a bid. you can turn toward it (engage), turn away (ignore), or turn against it (dismiss). successful couples turn toward bids 86% of the time vs 33% in failing relationships.

Stop scrolling your phone when your partner tries to show you a meme. sounds small but these micro rejections accumulate into ""my partner doesn't care about me"" which becomes ""why am i even here.""

**the ""struggle well"" framework**

Found this concept in multiple sources but therapist Terry Real articulates it best. healthy relationships aren't conflict free, they're conflicts where both people feel heard and nobody keeps score.

His book ""[Us: Getting Past You and Me to Build a More Loving Relationship](https://www.amazon.com/Us-Getting-Build-Loving-Relationship/dp/0593233670)"" breaks down how most people approach conflict from a ""i'm right, you're wrong"" framework. (Real has been doing relationship therapy for 30+ years and trains therapists internationally. insanely good read that feels like someone's narrating your exact relationship patterns.)

He teaches ""relational mindfulness"" which is pausing mid argument to remember you actually like this person and the goal isn't winning, it's solving the problem together. sounds obvious but try doing it when you're pissed about dishes for the 400th time.

One technique: the ""X Y Z"" formula. ""when you do X in situation Y, i feel Z."" not ""you always"" or ""you never."" those are relationship killers that put people in defensive mode instantly.

**ritual building beats spontaneity**

Controversial take but spontaneity is overrated in long relationships. what keeps couples connected is ritualized intimacy. weekly check ins, morning coffee together, sunday farmers market walks, whatever.

These rituals create relationship infrastructure. they're non negotiable time that's protected from work, kids, life chaos. they signal ""this matters more than everything else demanding our attention.""

I use [Lasting](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lasting-marriage-couples/id1225049619) (another relationship app) which structures these check ins with specific frameworks. covers everything from conflict styles to financial stress to sexual satisfaction. takes like 10 minutes but forces structured communication instead of just venting about random stuff.

If you want a more fun way to absorb all this relationship psychology without reading 10 books, there's an AI app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from relationship experts like Esther Perel, Gottman, Sue Johnson, and Terry Real to create personalized audio learning. 

You can tell it something specific like ""keep intimacy alive as a couple with demanding careers"" and it generates a custom learning plan just for your situation. The depth is adjustable too, so you can do quick 15 minute episodes during your commute or 40 minute deep dives with actual examples and case studies when you have more time. The voice options are genuinely addictive (there's this smoky, conversational one that makes relationship psychology feel less clinical). Way easier than trying to coordinate reading the same book with your partner.

**the vulnerability loop**

Dr. Sue Johnson's work on Emotionally Focused Therapy shows that emotional accessibility and responsiveness are what create secure attachment in adults. (her book ""[Hold Me Tight](https://www.amazon.com/Hold-Me-Tight-Conversations-Lifetime/dp/031611300X/ref=bmx_dp_d_sccl_1_1/138-2006816-5498558?psc=1)"" has sold over 2 million copies and her therapy model has the highest success rate for couples therapy.)

Most relationship advice focuses on communication skills but that's surface level. underneath fights about money or chores or sex, there's usually a deeper ""are you there for me?"" question.

The pattern: one person feels disconnected, reaches out (often through criticism or complaint because they don't know how else), the other person feels attacked and withdraws, first person feels more abandoned, escalates... and you're stuck in a shitty loop.

Breaking it requires vulnerability. saying ""when you stay late at work every night, i feel like i'm not a priority and it scares me"" instead of ""you're never home, you obviously don't care about this relationship.""

Most people avoid that level of honesty because it feels exposing. but that's literally what intimacy is. letting someone see the scared, needy, uncertain parts.

**your relationship is a third entity**

Here's what nobody tells you: a healthy long term relationship requires treating ""the relationship"" as something separate from both individuals. it has needs independent from yours.

Sometimes what ""the relationship"" needs conflicts with what you want in that moment. maybe you want to stay home, but the relationship needs you two to go be social together. maybe you want to be right in an argument, but the relationship needs you to let it go.

This reframe helps when you're stuck in ""me vs you"" mode. try ""what does our relationship need right now?"" as a tiebreaker question.

The spark doesn't die naturally. it dies from neglect, from assuming you've figured each other out, from treating your partner like furniture that's just there.

Every relationship exists in one of two states: growing or dying. neutral isn't real. you're either actively building toward each other or slowly drifting apart.

The couples who make it past 5, 10, 20+ years? they're not lucky. they're not soulmates. they just decided the relationship was worth consistent effort even when it wasn't exciting, even when Netflix seemed more appealing than conversation, even when they were tired and irritated and wanted to be left alone.

That's not romantic in a movie sense. but it's romantic in a real sense. choosing someone over and over when you could choose comfort instead.",2,1769627663.0,Datingat21st,0,1.0,False

Ok lang sana tiisin mga yan kung bumawi sa quality ng food, but sadly, no parin 😞 Sakto lang ang price for us, but the taste? 👎🏻 

We ordered the best selling (according sa waiter) steak rice (400php) pagkaserve, hindi siya steak but tapsilog 😞 We asked kung tama yung na-serve since may tapsilog talaga sila sa menu, yes daw tama 😞 Kaya pala nagtataka and slightly natuwa na din kami kasi steak ang description sa menu and ganun ang price, tapos misleading pala 😞

Also got the Thai Lime Chicken (300+php) was expecting na kahit pano e may “Thai” touch. Pero wala, kahit isang herb to say na Thai yung dish wala ka makikita or malalasahan and the chicken was cooked in a hurry, malakas ang apoy I supposes kasi mapait na yung breading 😞

Their Mango Shake was disappointing too 😞 Lasang lasa mo na it’s a mix of powdered Mango flavor and a bit of mango puree with whipped cream on top. Nakakalungkot 

The chicken and waffles din. Waffles was a bit bland, cold na when served and medyo matigas. The chicken was also bitter and looked over cooked so mapait 😞

We were planning to order their coffee din sana since coffee lovers kami, buti na lang hindi na namin ginawa. We went to Wyndell’s instead, na a few minutes away lang from Mirador. Ordered pizza, huhu 10/10 🥹 And coffee huhuhu 10/10 🥹 Kaya dahil busog na, nagtake out na lang kami ng iba pang food and lahat masarap huhuuhu 🥹 Sana nauna namin na-try sa Wyndell’s.

I am flying to Medellín (Colombia) in ten days. This marks the beginning of an open-ended trip through South America that may last several months. I have no fixed return date.

I am a chef. The purpose of this journey is cultural and culinary immersion. I want to eat locally, learn ingredients, techniques, and regional food identities, and later translate this experience into my professional work.

Current rough idea (not yet fully coherent):

Start in Medellín

Travel through Colombia following the coffee regions

Continue south into Peru, mainly for cacao, food culture, history, and local traditions

From southern Peru, enter Bolivia to volunteer at a monkey rescue center

Reach the Amazon basin, take a slow boat along the Amazon River, and travel toward Manaus

From Manaus, continue to Salvador, Bahia (Brazil)

My doubts:

Geographically, this route feels inefficient. Going from Colombia to Peru, then Bolivia, then back north to the Amazon, and finally east toward Manaus seems convoluted. I know the Amazon can be accessed from Peru (for example via Iquitos), but I am unsure what makes the most sense if I want to travel slowly and rely on overland routes or river transport where possible.

I am also interested in participating in an ayahuasca ceremony in a serious, non-touristic context. I understand this usually points to the Peruvian Amazon, which complicates the route further.

My priorities:

Slow travel

Boats over planes whenever realistic

A food-driven route focused on markets, regional products, and local kitchens

Exploring the Amazon respectfully, with local communities, learning about indigenous ways of life, local fauna, and survival knowledge

What I am asking for:

Help restructuring this into a route that actually works on the ground

Insights from people who have traveled through these regions

Advice on where the Amazon leg fits best when coming from the Andes

Perspectives from chefs or food-focused travelers in particular

This may be better suited to some kind of physical therapy subreddit so if this is the wrong place please let me know.

I'm very skinny and tall (6'3"" and \~160lbs). I probably eat \~1500 calories most days, usually fruit and toast for breakfast, a pastry or bagel and coffee for lunch, and a sizeable, pretty balanced dinner with protein, vegetables, carbs. For most of my life I've never exercised. I take psych meds (Venlafaxine 150,  Quetiapine 100, Lithium 750), no supplements, drink a little (maybe 1-2 a week on average) but no other prescription or recreational drugs.

About 6 months ago I decided I should start trying to get in shape, and started running and bicycling a bit and using weights at home. Around October I joined a gym, and in December I started using weight machines. I mostly used the lowest weights, and did 3 sets of 10 on each, rests of \~30secs between, as far as I could figure, normal stuff that pushed me but didn't feel like too much. I also started trying to get more protein into my diet, but probably not as consistently or seriously as I could have.

Pretty soon after the first time I tried the machines I felt that I'd hurt my back. The pain's in the middle back (low, but above lumbar), and for 95% of my day it's fine until I need to bend all the way over, or sometimes when I'm standing up or sitting down. It's not nerve pain, it's definitely in the muscle. At first I thought I probably just pulled it or pushed myself too far.

After that I looked up how I could have hurt myself, and continued to work out but skipped the machines I thought were responsible. It persisted, so I stopped machines, and then stopped exercising altogether in case something I couldn't identify was making it worse. I also apply heat to my back most nights, not for that long because of discomfort but about 30 minutes?

Now it's 1 month later (probably closer to 2 months) and it's still noticeable, though definitely improved. From what I see online this is too long to wait for something like this to improve, but it's not so awful that I feel like I'd get anything from going to a doctor.

My questions are 1) what can I do to actually fix my back so I can exercise again, and 2) for exercising and diet, what should I have done differently or what should I do now to avoid this again?",1,1769626938.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1qpkl11,https://www.reddit.com/r/private_equity/comments/1qpkl11/things_i_didnt_expect_to_hear_so_often_at_an_eta/,Things I didn’t expect to hear so often at an ETA conference,"I was at an INSEAD Singapore ETA conference recently, mostly just listening. Panels, hallway chats, coffee lines. Nothing groundbreaking, but a few things kept coming up and stuck with me.

One was how personal these deals actually are. I knew that in theory. Still, hearing seller stories back to back made it feel different. A lot of these people have been running the same business for decades. It’s not a “process” to them. It’s just their life.

I noticed how often buyers underestimate that gap.

Most owners I heard about were mid-40s to 70s. The buyers talking to them were usually much younger. Different defaults. Different language. And sellers seem to assume, almost automatically, that buyers won’t really understand what they do.

The buyers who got further weren’t the ones with better spreadsheets. They were the ones who could talk about the business in the same words the owner used. Same terms. Same mental shortcuts. Not trying to sound smart. Just familiar. A few searchers said once they could describe the day-to-day better than expected, the conversation relaxed a bit.

Another thing that surprised me was outreach. A few people from India and Taiwan mentioned physical letters. Actual mail. Not as a gimmick, just because emails weren’t getting replies. Apparently letters still work with some owners. Not always, but enough to matter. It signals effort, not scale. That seemed to resonate more than perfectly crafted emails.

I also kept hearing sellers worry about what happens after the sale. Less about price, more about damage. Will a new owner mess things up. Will employees leave. Will customers notice.

Some buyers handled that by talking about who’s backing them. Not in a flashy way. More like, “These are the people I lean on. They’ve run companies like this.” It seemed to calm sellers when they could picture support beyond just one individual figuring it out alone.

And then there was tone. Warmth came up a lot. Consistency too. Showing up the same way every time. No sudden switch into deal mode. A few people said things fell apart the moment sellers felt rushed or treated like an obstacle instead of a person.

One seller described their company like a family member. That sounds dramatic, but after hearing it a few times, I get it. If you ran something for 25 years, it probably feels closer to that than to an asset.

I’m still processing all this, honestly. Curious how others here see it. For those who’ve actually bought or tried to buy SMBs, what ended up mattering more than you expected when talking to sellers?

She’s excellent, an author of the kind of books you savor slowly, and a firm believer in the “hand-crafted” approach.

I couldn’t help myself and tried to pitch her on StoryM again, but she was still firmly against using AI writing tools. I knew words alone wouldn’t convince her, so I opened my laptop right there at the table and walked her through it, showing her how it actually functions within the creative process.

It was a long meetup: four hours, two rounds of coffee, brunch, and intense debate. In the end, she didn’t exactly “surrender,” but she offered a metaphor about AI writing that was so precise and gentle it stopped me in my tracks.

I thought: No wonder she’s such a good writer.

She compared writing to “painting a tree.” And from where she stood, she saw three ways people approach AI:

You do all the creative work yourself, then hand the draft to AI to fix up, polish the grammar, smooth the sentences. It’s like you’ve already painted the tree, and now you’re asking AI to take a fine brush and outline every single leaf, trying to make them look perfect.

**Philosophy B: AI as the Ghostwriter.**

You build the structure, the trunk and the main branches, and then delegate the rest. You’re the architect, AI is the bricklayer. You expect it to fill in the thousands of leaves for you.

**Philosophy C: AI as the Growth Engine.**

You plant a seed, and AI helps catalyze it into a trunk. You prune the branches together; AI might even help you extend new limbs from the main stem. But at the very end, every single leaf must be painted by your own hand.

After a lot of experimenting, failing, and writing hundreds of thousands of words with AI assistance, I’ve become convinced: **Only the third philosophy works for serious literary creation.**

When my mom told me, she asked me to come over, and I did. I laid in bed with her, listened to her, and tried to comfort her. I also reached out to my dad the day I found out and later agreed to meet him for coffee to talk.

Since then, I’ve been overwhelmed and emotionally exhausted. I told my mom I needed time and space to process everything and that I wasn’t ready to talk or act like things were normal yet.

Despite this, my mom continued to send me messages pressuring me to talk to my dad, framing my boundaries as me “hurting” them or being ungracious. She also minimized what happened and defended my dad, even saying he wasn’t really cheating and that nothing had changed.

Around this time, wedding planning also came up. I told my dad I did not want him walking me down the aisle. I did not tell him he wasn’t invited to the wedding, only that I didn’t want him in that role. My mom later accused me of telling him he wasn’t invited at all, which isn’t true.

I eventually told both of them that I wasn’t willing to discuss this further right now and that I needed my boundaries respected. I said I would reach out when and if I was ready.

I’m including screenshots of messages (with identifying information removed) for context here:

The Champions League action is heating up, and today’s **Man City vs Galatasaray** match is definitely the one to watch. Whether you're a Cityzen expecting a Haaland masterclass or a Gala fan hoping for that legendary Turkish grit, you don't want to be stuck with a laggy, 360p stream that freezes every time someone enters the box.

# Match Info:

* **Date:** Wednesday, January 28
* **Kick-off:** 3 p.m. ET
* **Venue:** Camp Nou (Barcelona, Spain) — *Note: Interesting neutral venue for this one!*
* **Official Broadcaster:** Paramount+

# My Setup: SphereIPTV

If you’re tired of paying for five different streaming services just to follow your team, I’ve been using **SphereIPTV** lately and it’s a total lifesaver.

**Why I’m digging it:**

* **Quality:** You get the game in **HD/UHD**. The clarity is insane, and it’s actually stable.
* **Price:** It’s only **$15/month**. For the price of a couple of coffees, you get everything.
* **Total Coverage:** This is the big one for me. You can use the same platform to watch all **US sports (NFL, NBA)**, plus **UK and Canadian channels**. It basically consolidates your entire sports package into one app.

Panels, hallway chats, coffee lines. Nothing groundbreaking, but a few things kept coming up and stuck with me.

One was how personal these deals actually are. I knew that in theory. Still, hearing seller stories back to back made it feel different. A lot of these people have been running the same business for decades. It’s not a “process” to them. It’s just their life.

I noticed how often buyers underestimate that gap.

Most owners I heard about were mid-40s to 70s. The buyers talking to them were usually much younger. Different defaults. Different language. And sellers seem to assume, almost automatically, that buyers won’t really understand what they do.

The buyers who got further weren’t the ones with better spreadsheets. They were the ones who could talk about the business in the same words the owner used. Same terms. Same mental shortcuts. Not trying to sound smart. Just familiar. A few searchers said once they could describe the day-to-day better than expected, the conversation relaxed a bit.

Another thing that surprised me was outreach. A few people from India and Taiwan mentioned physical letters. Actual mail. Not as a gimmick, just because emails weren’t getting replies. Apparently letters still work with some owners. Not always, but enough to matter. It signals effort, not scale. That seemed to resonate more than perfectly crafted emails.

I also kept hearing sellers worry about what happens after the sale. Less about price, more about damage. Will a new owner mess things up. Will employees leave. Will customers notice.

Some buyers handled that by talking about who’s backing them. Not in a flashy way. More like, “These are the people I lean on. They’ve run companies like this.” It seemed to calm sellers when they could picture support beyond just one individual figuring it out alone.

And then there was tone. Warmth came up a lot. Consistency too. Showing up the same way every time. No sudden switch into deal mode. A few people said things fell apart the moment sellers felt rushed or treated like an obstacle instead of a person.

One seller described their company like a family member. That sounds dramatic, but after hearing it a few times, I get it. If you ran something for 25 years, it probably feels closer to that than to an asset.

I’m still processing all this, honestly. Curious how others here see it. For those who’ve actually bought or tried to buy SMBs, what ended up mattering more than you expected when talking to sellers?

I went on a date with a girl i could tell had interest and the date went well. We had great conversation, held hands and kissed. She had locked herself out of her place and we ended up breaking back in which actually felt quite romantic in a sense. We grabbed some drinks, listened to some music and she played her guitar.

I ended up crashing on her huge couch and we had some coffee together before she needed to do some work. So as i left i went for a few more kisses which she also went in for but after about 3 kisses she gave me her cheek. I played it off saying ""i could do that all day"" then wishing each other a nice day and saying bye.

I worry i came on too strong here as i left and ruined it all or that i came across as stupid because i didn't escalate things the first night.

✨ coffee shop mornings where we spill everything  
✨ bar hopping, club nights, dancing until sunrise  
✨ throwing parties, celebrating milestones, birthdays, wins

✨ girls’ nights that turn into core memories

This is all happening in a **brand-new GTA roleplay server**, **Coming Home RP**, opening **February 6th** — built around **realism, immersion, and long-term storytelling**. This isn’t rushed RP. This is about building characters with history, emotions, and growth — and making women a powerful part of the city ✨

🚑 **EMS women** — emotional calls, hospital sisterhoods, decompressing after trauma, late-night talks, and bonds that feel like family.  
🚔 **Police women** — meaningful patrols, investigations that unfold naturally, trusted partners, respect earned, and storylines that matter.  
🖤 **MC & gang women** — deep loyalty, protection, family, sisterhood, power, and RP where women are central, respected, and influential.  
☕ **Civilian women** — businesses, friendships, romance, drama, cozy routines, and slice-of-life moments that make the city feel real.

I’m looking for women who want **slow-burn RP**, emotional depth, realism, and genuine connection. Girls who uplift each other, have fun together, show up for one another, and want RP that feels like a **TV series you’re living inside** — not just logging into 🩷

I'm not trying to complain and tell that my family life is abusive, but I just can't understand why I am now being slandered as the selfish one in the family.

I did not have time to cook rice for the family but I was already rushing out the door to not be late for school. I come back home as usual before finding everyone seemed to be in a sour mood. I asked my grandfather first and he expressed that ""Somebody"" forgot to do cook the rice. I immediately realized what my cousins and parents were so upset about as I went to the kitchen and see that the rice cooker still had no rice since the time I left. My Dad was the most pissed off about this, saying in his words that ""Are you happy now that you didn't do your responsibility?"" and added ""You only cook the rice when YOU are the one hungry, not when you ever considered that your family is"". I quickly tried to defend myself before he threw his coffee mug to the walls and shouted that I was selfish, inconsiderate, and spoiled. My cousins and my grandparents stayed quiet and didn't say anything as I was then leaded to my room for my father to ""cool down"". I can't stop myself from crying and I'm starting to feel more wronged then guilty about what I've done. I just don't understand why I am considered selfish when I only missed one thing to do on one day. I just don't know what I should do about this. On one hand I want to defend myself and put it into comparison that my cousins are about the same age as me and yet they didn't cook rice for themselves. Or say that why didn't they nobody else cooked it and waited for me to come home and tell me about it?

1qpk9iv,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qpk9iv/resting_and_storing_beans/,Resting and storing beans,"Hey everyone, 

In general, how do you determine how long to rest beans you've never tried?  Do you have a set period of time you rest certain types of beans / roasts and then brew a cup and determine if it needs more rest?  Also, how long can you store beans in their bag before they start to go stale and if you're reaching that point does storing in an air tight container help at all?  

As someone newer to this I'm having a hard time figuring this out because recommendations for roasting beans seem to be all over the place.  It seems like most roasters will tell you ""at least"" two weeks but in practice most people here seem to rest lighter roasts much much longer than that.  

Frankly I'm also new enough where I'm not sure my palate is developed enough to taste a coffee and really know whether it needs more rest, so what are some specific things I should be looking for when I taste a coffee that tell me whether or not it needs more rest?

The Champions League action is heating up, and today’s **Man City vs Galatasaray** match is definitely the one to watch. Whether you're a Cityzen expecting a Haaland masterclass or a Gala fan hoping for that legendary Turkish grit, you don't want to be stuck with a laggy, 360p stream that freezes every time someone enters the box.

# Match Info:

* **Date:** Wednesday, January 28
* **Kick-off:** 3 p.m. ET
* **Venue:** Camp Nou (Barcelona, Spain) — *Note: Interesting neutral venue for this one!*
* **Official Broadcaster:** Paramount+

# My Setup: SphereIPTV

If you’re tired of paying for five different streaming services just to follow your team, I’ve been using **SphereIPTV** lately and it’s a total lifesaver.

**Why I’m digging it:**

* **Quality:** You get the game in **HD/UHD**. The clarity is insane, and it’s actually stable.
* **Price:** It’s only **$15/month**. For the price of a couple of coffees, you get everything.
* **Total Coverage:** This is the big one for me. You can use the same platform to watch all **US sports (NFL, NBA)**, plus **UK and Canadian channels**. It basically consolidates your entire sports package into one app.

Then I stopped consuming them for 60 days and finally fixed my life.

I’m 27 now. For years I was completely absorbed in other people’s drama, problems, and struggles. I’d spend hours every day consuming them.

Scrolling through people’s relationship problems on Reddit. Reading about strangers’ career struggles. Watching videos about other people’s life crises. Following drama between people I’d never met. Consuming endless posts about problems that had nothing to do with me.

I knew everything about everyone else’s problems. I could tell you about the relationship drama between people I’d never meet. The career struggles of strangers online. The family issues of content creators. The controversies and conflicts between groups I wasn’t part of.

Meanwhile my own life was falling apart and I was doing nothing about it.

I had real problems. A job I hated. Debt I wasn’t addressing. Health issues I was ignoring. Relationships I wasn’t maintaining. Goals I wasn’t working toward.

But instead of fixing any of that, I’d spend 5 hours a day consuming other people’s problems.

I’d wake up and immediately scroll through relationship advice subreddits reading about other people’s issues. I’d spend my lunch break watching videos about strangers’ life problems. I’d spend my evenings reading drama and controversies that had zero impact on my actual life.

I was completely invested in problems that weren’t mine while my actual problems just sat there getting worse.

The insane part was it felt productive. Like I was learning something or staying informed or being empathetic. Really I was just avoiding my own life by obsessing over other people’s.

It was easier to think about stranger’s relationship problems than address my own loneliness. Easier to read about other people’s career struggles than work on my own. Easier to watch other people’s drama than deal with my own issues.

Consuming other people’s problems was my escape from having to face and fix my own.

And I’d gotten addicted to it. Every spare moment was filled with other people’s issues. I couldn’t sit with my own thoughts or problems for 5 minutes without reaching for my phone to consume someone else’s.

The wake up call came when I realized I could tell you intimate details about the lives of hundreds of strangers online but I hadn’t called my own parents in 3 weeks. I knew more about internet drama than about my own finances. I was more invested in other people’s problems than my own growth.

I was 27 and I’d spent years obsessing over problems that had nothing to do with me while my actual problems just accumulated.

My debt was growing. My health was declining. My relationships were shallow. My career was stagnant. And I was doing nothing about any of it because I was too busy consuming other people’s problems.

That’s when I made a decision. For 60 days I was going to stop consuming other people’s problems entirely and focus only on my own.

No relationship drama subreddits. No videos about stranger’s life crises. No following controversies. No consuming anyone’s problems except my own.

I’d take all that time and energy I was wasting on other people’s issues and redirect it toward fixing my actual life.

People thought I was being cold or antisocial. I wasn’t abandoning empathy, I was just stopping the obsessive consumption of problems that had nothing to do with me.

I made a list of my actual problems. The real ones affecting my actual life, not strangers’ problems I was consuming online.

$8,400 in debt. Job I hated making $38k. 30 pounds overweight. No close friendships. No romantic relationship. No savings. No direction.

Those were my problems. Not the relationship drama between people I’d never meet. Not the career struggles of strangers. Not the controversies I had no stake in.

I’m gonna be real with you, this might sound like I’m selling something. I’m not getting paid. But after years of consuming other people’s problems while ignoring my own, I needed structure to actually focus.

I used this app called Reload to build a 60 day plan focused entirely on my actual problems. Set it up with everything I’d been ignoring while consuming other people’s issues.

Here’s what made it work. It blocked every place I’d go to consume other people’s problems. Reddit, YouTube drama channels, Twitter controversies, relationship advice forums, all of it blocked during the day.

It structured my time with actions that addressed my actual problems. Pay down debt, apply to better jobs, work out, reach out to people, build skills. Real solutions to real problems instead of consuming strangers’ issues.

Day 1 I woke up and instinctively tried to open Reddit to read relationship drama. Blocked. Tried to watch a video about some controversy. Blocked.

So I just sat with my own problems for the first time in years. And they were worse than I’d realized because I’d been avoiding them.

But now I couldn’t avoid them. I had to actually deal with them.

Week 1 was uncomfortable. I was so used to escaping into other people’s problems that sitting with my own felt overwhelming.

But the plan gave me specific actions. Track spending and cut $200 from budget. Apply to 5 jobs. Work out 3 times. Message 3 people to reconnect.

Small steps toward fixing actual problems instead of consuming fictional ones.

Week 2 I started seeing results. Saved $340 by cutting spending I’d been ignoring. Applied to 12 jobs. Worked out 4 times. Had coffee with an old friend.

More progress on my actual problems in two weeks than in two years of consuming other people’s.

Week 3 and 4 I realized how much mental energy I’d been wasting. All those hours spent reading about stranger’s relationship drama, I redirected into actually building relationships. All that time watching other people’s career problems, I spent improving my own situation.

By week 4 I’d paid off $900 in debt. Had 3 job interviews scheduled. Lost 7 pounds. Was rebuilding actual friendships.

My actual life was improving because I was finally paying attention to it instead of everyone else’s.

Month 2 everything accelerated. I couldn’t consume other people’s problems so I had to focus on mine.

Got a job offer for $51k. Paid off another $1,200 in debt. Down 14 pounds. Had a small group of friends I was actually close with instead of hundreds of strangers whose drama I followed.

Month 3 I realized I didn’t miss it at all. I didn’t care about the relationship drama I used to obsess over. Didn’t care about controversies between people I’d never meet. Didn’t care about strangers’ problems.

I cared about my own life. Which was actually getting better because I was working on it.

By day 60 I’d transformed everything I’d been ignoring. Paid off $3,100 in debt. Making $51k at a better job. Down 18 pounds. Had real friendships. Was actually present in my own life.

It’s been 4 months since I stopped. I still don’t consume other people’s problems. I check in on friends and family, but I don’t spend hours consuming strangers’ drama and issues.

My debt is almost gone. I’m healthier. My relationships are real. My career is better. My life is actually mine because I stopped living vicariously through other people’s problems.

Here’s what I learned. Consuming other people’s problems is avoidance. It’s easier to think about stranger’s issues than face your own.

Every hour you spend absorbed in other people’s drama is an hour you’re not spending fixing your actual life.

You can’t fix your problems while you’re obsessed with everyone else’s. Your mental energy is finite. You’re either using it on your life or wasting it on theirs.

Most people are experts on strangers’ problems while their own life falls apart. They know every detail of online drama but can’t tell you their own bank balance.

Stop consuming other people’s problems. They’re not your problems. They’re distractions from your actual problems.

I used Reload to enforce 60 days of focusing only on my problems. Blocked all the places I’d consume others’ issues, structured daily actions toward fixing my actual life, accountability that prevented me from escaping back into consumption.

Make a list of your actual problems. The real ones in your actual life. Those are what deserve your mental energy.

Stop reading about strangers’ relationship drama and work on your own relationships. Stop following controversies and work on your own growth. Stop consuming problems and start fixing yours.

Give it 60 days of zero consumption of other people’s problems. Redirect all that energy into your own life.

See how much you can fix when you’re actually paying attention to it instead of everyone else’s.

Your problems won’t fix themselves while you’re obsessed with strangers’ problems. They’ll just get worse while you’re distracted.

Stop consuming. Start fixing.

Thanks for reading. How many hours a day are you spending on other people’s problems while your own sit there unfixed?

Stop today. Focus on your actual life. Fix your actual problems.

60 days from now your life will be completely different. But only if you stop wasting your mental energy on problems that aren’t yours.

1qpjw79,https://www.reddit.com/r/shoppingaddiction/comments/1qpjw79/repair_after_financial_infidelity_from_my_shopping/,Repair after financial infidelity from my shopping,"I’m hoping to get some perspective from people who’ve navigated trust repair after financial infidelity.

I (35F) disclosed financial infidelity to my partner (33M) (hiding and lying about spending / financial details) late last year. I understand why this hurt him and damaged trust, and I take responsibility for it. I’m genuinely committed to repairing things and not repeating old patterns.

\*Edited to add spending context: I spent around 40k last year on unnecessary things and shopping (mostly clothes but I would hide them from him). I would often put it on credit cards and then use my savings that I was saving towards our mutual goal of getting a house to cover the credit cards. I also did early withdraw some funds from an old 401k to help pay down balances but the impulsivity just kept getting the best of me. All of it was my own money , we don’t have shared accounts but I did spend money from agreed upon goals. I have since paid off everything. I am very fortunate to have a job that I could dig my $10k cc bills off in 2 months.

For additional context: last year I wasn’t showing up well in our relationship. I was dealing with a major depressive episode, multiple personal traumas, and what I now know was undiagnosed ADHD. That doesn’t excuse the financial infidelity, but it does help explain why my functioning and follow-through were inconsistent at the time. Since then, I’ve been actively engaged in therapy, have made meaningful progress, and am now starting medication for ADHD.

Since disclosure, I’ve been trying to show consistency through behaviors that feel concrete and observable to me, including:

•	budgeting and not overspending

•	taking on and following through with shared responsibilities and chores

•	being more structured and routine-oriented

•	pausing instead of acting impulsively

•	communicating more clearly when I can’t complete something on time

•	taking better care of my physical and mental health

Some of these things are a process of trying to figure out new ways of engaging. But the core pieces I have consistently been fully successful are showing up equitably and budgeting/financial goals.

My partner has shared that consistency is his main non-negotiable for rebuilding trust. He’s asked me to identify very concrete, observable behaviors that I can consistently do so he can “see the progress” (for example, things like no social media or even things like not drinking coffee). (Context for coffee: I realized I wasn’t enjoying the taste of the coffees I was making, I was trying other morning drinks but wanted to retry coffee but a new way but still equitable price if not cheaper than what I was doing). (Context for social media: it has been a trigger and working with my therapist I was trying re-exposure to mixed results, no impulses or shopping yay!, but it does consume my mind a lot, I am finding I am needing a lot of mental stimulation and trying to figure out what that is).

I understand the desire for predictability and reassurance after trust has been broken. Where I’m struggling is that when consistency becomes about tracking or monitoring very specific behaviors—especially ones that don’t directly relate to finances—it starts to feel overwhelming and dysregulating for me. I worry that it turns the dynamic into one where I’m being evaluated rather than where trust is slowly rebuilt. I also worry about the ramifications of the process of trying to find balance.

I’ve tried suggesting other ways to show consistency, such as shared check-ins, reviewing finances together, or discussing progress in therapy. At this point, my partner isn’t open to reviewing finances and has expressed doubts about whether things like chores or day-to-day responsibilities are really being done, even when I believe they are observable.

I’m not trying to avoid accountability, and I know trust repair takes time. I’m just feeling stuck and unsure how to move forward when the changes I’m making don’t seem to register, and the request for monitoring feels hard for me to tolerate long-term.

Some questions I’m hoping for insight on:

•	What does healthy trust repair after financial infidelity actually look like in practice?

•	Are concrete behavior changes helpful, and how do couples decide which behaviors matter most?

•	How do you balance accountability and transparency without creating a monitoring or surveillance dynamic?

•	At what point does trust repair also require engagement or effort from the injured partner?

I care deeply about this relationship and want to do this in a way that’s genuinely healing for both of us. I’d really appreciate thoughtful perspectives or lived experiences.",5,1769625516.0,shoppingaddiction,1,1.0,False

I’ve been debating between a compact drip-style machine vs pod-based options. Size, cleanup, and reliability matter more to me than advanced features. I’ve seen some compact models like the #Tastyle Coffee Maker mentioned elsewhere, but I’m more interested in real-world experiences than brand specs.

For those of you with smaller kitchens:

Do compact machines actually hold up long term?

Is countertop footprint or ease of cleaning more important in daily use?

I’m tired of copy paste replies from support","First of all, let me clarify that this is no longer about missing content, but about the way EA is treating its customers. Yes, we are not gamers, we are **CUSTOMERS**.

**Case:**

I’ve been using the *“Tombstone”* pack from the preorder since the game’s release without any issues. Recently, after a new patch, this pack was removed or deactivated from my account. I don’t know the exact day it happened or how. I have no idea.

I opened a ticket with EA Support, and since then I’ve received 7–8 responses from Gaurav, Mayank, Ajay, Dipesh, etc. None of them seem to have actually read my case. No checks, no investigation, just macros and repeated account verification requests. 

Ah! And Chirag! how could I forget his macro?

**Again:**

I’ve been using the *“Tombstone”* pack up until the last patch, approximately the one that fixed the Pro Pass, which previously couldn’t be completed.

I’ve been an EA Pro Pass user for several months, which includes Phantom + preorder bonuses. Later, in order to support a game I’ve been playing for over 20 years, I purchased the Phantom Edition directly from the EA store, along with additional packages.

I am not a free user. I am a **paying customer**.

At this point, I’m not even worried about the deactivated content anymore. I’m simply stunned by the way EA support treats its customers. Imagine buying a coffee machine, having an issue, and receiving this kind of “support.”

Something has to change. I will not buy anything else until I receive the proper support I deserve.

1qpjngn,https://i.redd.it/bqogscumv4gg1.jpeg,A Sin He Could Never Pay Off,"Three years after Tessa Reed remarried Roman West, she found out she was pregnant.

From the moment the test turned positive, she learned to move around him.

When he came home late, she stopped asking where he’d been.

When he stumbled in drunk, she just told the housekeeper to heat up some hangover soup and left it on the table.

When he said work was crazy, she didn’t text, didn’t call, didn’t show up at his office with coffee the way she used to.

Even when she found a smudge of unfamiliar lipstick on the passenger seat of his car, she quietly wiped it off with a tissue and tucked the tube back into the cup holder, as if it had never existed.

By the time she went to tour a luxury postpartum recovery center and ran straight into his affair again, the rage that had once torn her apart didn’t even bother to rise. There was no storm left in her, just a flat, exhausted kind of numbness.

Because this time, she already knew one thing with brutal clarity: she was not going to forgive him again.

...

“This is our most luxurious suite,” the sales rep chirped, heels clicking on the polished floor as she led Tessa down the hallway of the Manhattan recovery center. “Eighty-eight grand a month, all-inclusive. A Mrs. West is staying here right now—she checked in less than four days after having her baby boy.”

She lowered her voice, dropping into gleeful gossip.

“Her husband’s here every single day, all doting and handsome. Friends in and out, everyone cooing over the baby—total fairy tale. Only thing is, his…drive is a little much.” The woman giggled. “She literally just gave birth and he’s already back at it at night. Not great for recovery. You’ll have to set boundaries with your man, Ms. Reed.”

The woman kept chattering by her ear, but Tessa didn’t hear a single word.

Through the narrow glass panel in the door, her entire world had shrunk to the man inside the suite—Roman West, lounging on the couch, cradling a newborn in his arms while he laughed with the group of men around him.

Her vision blurred. Her eyes were burning before she even realized she was about to cry.

“Congrats, Roman! Another son!” one of his friends crowed.

“If Tessa’s baby turns out to be a boy too, you’ll have two sons. Man’s really winning at life, huh?” another joked.

“Roman’s the real MVP,” someone added, voice low and mocking. “One wife at home, one on the side, three years going strong, and I’d bet good money Tessa has no idea.”

Roman’s jaw tightened at that, his expression suddenly cooling.

“She doesn’t,” he said flatly. “And you’re not going to say a damn word to her. She’s in her third trimester. Stress is off the table.”

“We know, we know,” his friend rushed to say. “We’ve been covering your ass for three years. But seriously, Roman—when are you gonna tell her?”

Roman went quiet for a beat, then answered, voice steady, like he’d already rehearsed it.

“After she gives birth,” he said. “Once the baby’s here, Tessa won’t walk away from me.”

“Will it put you in a tough spot?”

The woman on the bed spoke up then, her voice soft and delicate, like each word might break in her mouth.

“Roman, I was never trying to take anything from her,” Elena murmured. “After Ryan died, just being able to give you a child felt like more than I deserved. I’m not asking for anything else.”

Roman shifted, sliding an arm around her shoulders and pulling her into his chest like she was made of spun glass.

“Elena,” he said quietly, “I promised I’d take care of you, and I will. I hate that you’ve had to sneak around for three years. You don’t deserve that.”

Out in the hallway, watching through the slim gap in the doorway, Tessa stared at the same face she’d once known as cool, distant, untouchable. Only now, that face was soft with tenderness—for someone else.

Her lips twisted into a smile that was all teeth and no warmth. It tasted like rust on her tongue.

1qpjn96,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1qpjn96/how_i_program_everywhere/,How I program everywhere,"So I've been programming in the metro, when waiting for the doctor, heck even in the bathroom. I mean it's quite the downfall from my dream of sitting in front of multiple large monitors with cmatrix style code, dark hoodies and insane typing speeds with Jarvis handing me my coffee.

But yeah I think I like this more.

So wanted to share how I do it, starting with the tools I use: 

* Linear for managing my tasks
* Github for hosting my repo
* Slack/Telegram for communication (currently in progress, but promising I tell you)
* LLMs - codex and claude code (expanding to gemini)

How they come together, imagine this: 

Using Linear on my phone,  I write down a task for my project,  put it in spec status.

Few minutes later I see a spec, read it, if I'm happy,  I set it as ready for dev, few minutes later a PR is ready.

If there are any failed checks on actions,  no worries few minutes later they're all fixed and ready for merge,  just needs my approval. 

I make a few comments, few minutes again all fixed, I look at it again, if I'm happy, I approve and merge. 

And how long? 30min, maybe an hour max, what could’ve possibly taken me a day or even a week?

Here’s the cool thing, I’m always doing multiple tasks and all in parallel. That was possibly weeks I was saving. Yeah Ik it’s pretty wild.

So what's happening under the hood?

Well whenever a Linear task is created a webhook is sent to my server (Linear has their webhook Api specs online so you could easily check the data that’s sent back). In the payload, I check whether the sent request is an issue/comment, see if it’s labeled AI (linear allows custom labels) and that the current status is ""Spec"" or ""Ready for dev (custom status), any other status just returns from here.

If the paylod is an issue and it’s in Spec, the webhook will use linear’s graphql api to comment “Writing spec” and assign itself to the task, fetches latest repo, automatically creates a new worktree, and then launches a docker container with the worktree mounted as a volume, the container has codex/claude in it(you can just use a slim alpine and install codex/claude on it) and passes on the command “work on {issue\_identifier}”. 

The LLM has linear’s mcp configured (you can check my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1qlhj62/a_few_of_the_mcps_i_use_on_a_daily_basis/) for the MCPs I use) so it can easily fetch the issue contents, see the title and any description in the issue, refer the codebase and write a proper spec directly to linear. I do not kill the container after the spec, mainly to save costs and to reuse context for following tasks.

If the spec isn’t ideal, I can comment under the spec/issue with the changes I want. Webhook fires-> payload is parsed-> content of the comment is checked, it must include “@ai”, if so it’s meant for the ai, since the container is still alive the llm can re-use the context session, saves me a lot of credit, you’ll thank me for it. Now command is passed- “Amend the spec on issue {issue\_identifier} according to this comment {comment\_content}”. The LLM does its thing and posts the new spec.

Once I’m satisfied with the spec, I move the issue to “Ready for Dev”, another webhook-> parse the payload-> checks issue statuses and sees it’s ready for dev, moves it to ""In Progress"", fetches that same container and passes the command- “Issue {issue\_identifier} is ready for implementation, start working on it, once finished commit and push to origin with a new PR”.

I’ll continue on another post on how I do the git side of things and communication as well, how I converse with codex/claude about new features and then tell it- “yeah sounds good, start working on on it” and it immediately sets up the linear issue, and does everything on its own, it’s pretty sick. 

But yeah, happy to get any more ways to improve on it, hope this helps and would love to see you guys set up your own coding Jarvis too ;).",1,1769624998.0,mcp,0,1.0,False
1qpjmpm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qpjmpm,Think I made my first discovery!,"Most people wouldn't be aware of **Abigail Stoneman**, so I'll summarise her [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail_Stoneman) which, based on the rather slender modern and 20th century notes, is how most people are aware of her.

She's a Rhode Island businesswoman who raised a family after her husband's apparent death in the French and Indian War. Over the 1760s she built-up a popular coffee-house in Newport which branched out into ballroom hire, guest-lodgings and catering. From 1770-72 she set-up shop in Boston around King Street so was present for the Boston Massacre, then left for Newport to get a liquor license and make money opening up to gambling.

She's married in 1774 to John Treville, a Knight of Malta, but after leaving for New York during The Troubles he skipped out and possibly stole her money. She next appears in 1777 opening up the London Coffee-House next to **Fraunces Tavern** on Broad Street, providing largely for the British and provincial forces. We see this in the 25 October edition of [*Rivington's New York Loyal Gazette*](https://archive.org/details/rivingtonsnewyor0000unse/page/126/mode/2up).

Except... in the *Royal Gazette* (Charleston's Loyalist paper) she appears in the 14 July 1781 entry, having come down from New York. She's acquired an apartment on the corner of Church and Tradd Streets, providing breakfasts and dinners and putting-up a Help Wanted ad for a waiter and house wench.

In the 22 May issue she announces her plans to open the London Coffee-House on 1 June on the corner of Broad and Church, with a special event for the King's Birthday planned (4 June) with pre-booked dining and a music band. This new London Coffee-House is referred to as the former Holliday's Tavern -- William Holliday had acquired the spot in 1771 from Robert Dillon who since the 1730s had regularly used its large space for Freemason dinners, St. Andrew Society dinners... *auctions*... Given the complications of people rarely giving house numbers in those days and the tendency for store owners to buy each other out, this is either the famous **Shepheard's Tavern**, or is directly opposite it (said tavern wouldn't be known by that name in the 1770s since I'm sure he was already dead).

This new coffee house however opened at a bad time, as you would imagine. Already the military government is running a dodgy refugee lottery scheme which despite offering a 39% chance to win (and every winning ticket being higher than the $6 ticket price) refugees don't have enough money to pay-in. So Mrs. Treville's clientele is almost certainly military officers and leading gentry.



TL;DR -- Minor gentry woman self-made multiple fortunes and went from New England to New York for a better life, then from New York to Charles-Town in a misguided belief it was the right move, so I've extended her known life from 1777 to 1782.",7,1769624966.0,revolutionarywar,1,0.9,False

First my coffee machine stopped working. It would still turn on and the pump was trying to get the water flowing but nothing was coming out. So I thought it needed descaling but no, still wasn't working. So I just thought I would buy a new one, no biggie. 

Then the kettle started dysfunctioning as well: I would put the kettle on the base, the base was on but it did not detect the kettle on it and did not heat up. And yesterday night, my thermomix started showing errors, saying the bowl was not on the bas, an error I had never seen before and it would stop heating up. 

I tired plugging them somewhere else without the power strip, same issue. For info : the kettle is 1-month-old and the thermomix 6-month-old. I had never heard of devices dysfunctioning without stopping completely...

1qpjh4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1qpjh4j/unpopular_opinion_hypomania_and_mania_distinction/,unpopular opinion: hypomania and mania distinction is stupid/flawed.,"i say this as someone with type 1, i say this as someone who at one point had  been in psychosis for around 10 months straight  and made a lot of irreversible life ruining decisions. i say this as someone who became a hard drug addict because of mania.  i say this as someone who has been hospitalized twice and in the psych hospital twice.

of course i have had some “hypomanic” episodes, and i do believe there is a difference in manic episodes, hypomania to me felt like a continuous extra strong  mood boosting cup of coffee, while full mania just felt like straight up meth to me.

because listen to this, the DSM-5 says that to be consider a manic episode as opposed to hypomania is based on if it causes significant impairment, but that is very flawed because that’s extremely dependent on life circumstances. for example, hypothetically, 2 people with the exact same internal mood state but eith 2 very different lives, one of them it causes significant impairment because they have more responsibilities and the other it doesn’t because they don’t, so same exact internal mood state in an ENDOGENOUS mood disorder, but 2 completely different diagnoses? i honestly prefer the DSM-3 where there wasn’t type 1 and 2 but just bipolar disorder and atypical bipolar disorder.

to me, it’s all a form of mania, and it doesn’t have to fit in a box. you can just say yeah this a mild moderate or severe manic episode. especially since it’s well known that many people with type 2 can flip into a type 1 diagnosis anyways, so what does that say?

edit: i’m glad people are agreeing, i posted something similar last year and everyone widely disagreed for some reason",18,1769624647.0,BipolarReddit,17,0.8,False

It was actually me preparing for my wife, she was away playing with the dog, so she didn't mind that she didn't have coffee but might have thought I just forgot about it entirely when I was at the very last step, lol.

But I had been engaged through the whole process. I know this is an easy task but there are a few small subtasks that I had to do like fill water tank, pick a cup and a capsule, turn the machine on, observe if it spits coffee. As soon as it started making coffee I probably walked away never to look back.

Most interestingly is that 1h later I came back to the room and worked 3 more hours right next to the coffee machine, literally 2 feet away from it, while the cup was sitting there and I didn't notice this at all yesterday, only this morning. Not even smelled it.

Anyways! I wanted to ask any tips, hacks, etc from your personal experience that helps you remember small tasks that you started. I do have a very active task list app that works well with me for things that are big enough to get to be written there, but this was like an impromptu request from my wife so these small things I normally don't write as a todo task, I just went immediately to executing it. But I forgot to deliver the end result.

I'm not medicated, only doing treatment with CBT. This will certainly be a topic for my next session, but I wanted to hear from the community as well.",1,1769624598.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

I chose to make a concept for a coffee shop refresh, since the ice cream shop got a refresh back in November (?), and the grocery store just had a refresh. Both were food-themed animals that fit the shop they're in. (Ice cream shop - Ice cream penguins and grocery store - fruit owls) Plus, also getting a legendary pet for the crystal egg fitting the theme, so here it is!

Coffee Bears! Maybe a bit biased because I'd love more bear pets, but the coffee concept is the main idea. I was thinking that, instead of honey, they could be tamed with cocoa beans or coffee beans.
