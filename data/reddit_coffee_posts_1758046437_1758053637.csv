Over the years I find that 70-80 ounces of fluid total a day is what I consume. (I am on some diuretics, so have to keep hydrated but not go overboard)

I used to always drink black tea once or twice a day, but have to admit black coffee has been my go to. I don’t go crazy though, only like 8-10 ounces a day total

I also love my green tea, chamomile and sometimes dandelion root.

1nisbj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RestaurantServices/comments/1nisbj3/a_day_on_our_grease_trap_route_in_san_francisco/,A Day on Our Grease Trap Route in San Francisco 🚛💧,"Our tech Evan started his day at **2:00 a.m.** with the first stop at **SFO**. We handle all of the airport’s grease traps, keeping things running smoothly behind the scenes while most of the city is still asleep.

From there we rolled into San Francisco proper. A couple of restaurants reached out last minute needing their grease traps pumped, and because we’re already in the city multiple times per week, we were able to fit them onto the route the same day. Flexibility like that is one of the big reasons local restaurants stick with us.

Midway through the route, Evan took a quick lunch break at **Yerba Buena Gardens** with an iced coffee before finishing the rest of the day’s stops.

Back at the yard, he wrapped up by submitting the **manifest paperwork**, checking in with our coordinator Serena, fueling, and washing down the truck so it’s ready for tomorrow.

This is pretty much what it looks like to run a grease trap route in San Francisco — from airport facilities to neighborhood restaurants.

1nis898,https://i.redd.it/swtgt77s2lpf1.jpeg,Coffee Data Analysis,"I completed a comprehensive data analysis project based on a coffee sales dataset. The project is structured into four main parts:

1. Data Cleaning using Alteryx

2. SQL Analysis (/sql-analysis)

3. PySpark Analysis (/pyspark-analysis)

4. Visualization with Looker Studio

I’m excited to share my analyses

**Chart: Revenue Over Time**

The curve shows the daily evolution of revenue.

A noticeable increase is observed towards the end of the first week (e.g., a peak around January 7 – 9), which may coincide with a special event or promotion.

There are also low-performance days (e.g., January 13 and 25).

The date range can be adjusted using the filter.

**Chart: Sales by Product**

The top revenue-generating products are:

Latte Rg

Latte

Cappuccino

Brazilian Coffee

Sustainable Coffee

All these items are coffee-based, indicating a strong customer preference for traditional and gourmet coffee drinks.

Other products like Dark Chocolate and Morning Tea also appear but contribute less to total revenue.

**Chart: Revenue Breakdown by Category**

Coffee is the core of the business.

Bakery and Chocolate categories perform well in cross-selling.

Beans represent a niche, likely appealing to loyal or specialty-oriented customers.

Table: Product Performance

Barista Espresso: Very popular with high revenue → key product

Brewed Teas: High volume, low price → entry-level or add-on products

Biscotti: Low sales but good margin → to promote in combos

Black / Chai Tea: Very low sales but high price → premium niche?

Clothing: Low volume, high price → branded merchandise that may need repositioning

**Chart: Revenue by Hour of the Day**

Press enter or click to view image in full size

Insights

Most profitable hour: 11:18:31 → approx. €1,500

Followed by: 09:55:47 (€1,200), 09:05:20 (€800)

Remaining hours generate significantly less revenue (€250 – €400)

Analysis

Sales peaks are concentrated in the morning, especially between 9:00 and 11:30.

Indicates high traffic during breakfast or morning coffee breaks.

Post-12:00 slots are far less profitable (e.g. 15:38, 19:24 → very low).

**Chart: Revenue Comparison by Location**

All three stores show a nearly identical distribution of revenue.

Hell’s Kitchen slightly leads.

This balance suggests a consistent business strategy across locations.

**Chart: Monthly Sales Volume **

Continuous sales growth from February to June (almost linear).

June is the highest-volume month.

January and February show the lowest volumes → likely the low season.

Having spent weeks testing the Bissell 2515A carpet cleaner formula, I’ve come to appreciate its remarkable ability to tackle stubborn stains and heavy dirt. Being a pet owner with two very energetic dogs, my carpets see all kinds of chaos—muddy paw prints, food spills, you name it. This full-sized cleaning formula practically erased every trace of these disasters right before my eyes. It doesn't just clean; it refreshes, leaving an unmistakable Febreze scent lingering on your freshly cleaned carpets. My living room rug, which carried the odor of pets for months, was suddenly as fresh as the day I bought it. Imagine how pleasantly surprised I was while entertaining guests! 

**Ease of Use with Carpet Cleaners**

The formula is specifically designed for upright carpet cleaning machines, and I paired it with a compatible system from the same brand. Filling the machine with the solution took only a couple of minutes, thanks to the conveniently marked measurements on the bottle. One thing I particularly noticed was how quickly the cleaner penetrated the fibers of the carpet. Within just a few passes, there was a visible difference in color and texture. Stains that typically resisted basic cleaning techniques vanished, proving just how well-suited this formula is for heavily soiled areas.

[Check Bissell 2515A price on Amazon.](https://sanue.com/p/b00dbtq1za/)  

**Focus on Safety**

What's even more reassuring is that this product is safe to use around kids and pets, provided you stick to the instructions. Knowing my dogs could freely roam the carpet post-cleaning gave me peace of mind. Unlike some harsh cleaners that leave behind strong chemical residues, the Bissell 2515A formula doesn’t contain heavy metals, phosphates, or dyes. Its biodegradable properties mean it’s both kind to your home and gentle on the environment. This eco-conscious angle really stood out in comparison to other solutions I’ve tried over the years.

**Strong Points**

- Thoroughly removes dirt and longstanding odors  
- Leaves a clean, refreshing scent  
- Easy on carpet fibers, rugs, and upholstery  
- Formulated without aggressive chemicals  
- Safe for children, pets, and the environment  

**Areas for Improvement**

Though the results were impressive, I found myself refilling the machine more frequently than anticipated.  

- Some stubborn stains required repeated passes  
- Scent, while pleasant, may be too strong for some  

**Good Points**

One notable highlight is how well it works on both carpets and upholstered furniture. We’ve got this beige ottoman that had suffered years of coffee spills and even mystery stains. After running this formula through my carpet cleaner over it, the fabric looked significantly brighter—enough for my partner to comment on it.

**Competitive Options**

Comparing the Bissell cleaner formula with a few competitors like the Hoover Deep Clean PetMax or Resolve High Traffic areas formula revealed a couple of key takeaways. While the Hoover product boasts powerful stain removal, it tends to emit a chemical undertone that lingers. Resolve, while budget-friendly, doesn’t offer the same deep-cleaning capabilities for tougher messes. What the Bissell solution does better is balancing effective cleaning power with a fresh, lasting fragrance. That’s not to say the competitors don’t have merit; they’re just not geared as much for the all-encompassing safety and cleaning reassurance this one provides.

**Cost Efficiency**

While it’s not the most affordable option, this formula’s performance justifies its price. In a market filled with cleaning products that promise perfection but often fall flat, this one genuinely delivers. Even though my initial expectation was to spend minimally on such things, the clarity of results and ease of use shifted my perspective. Investing in a product that keeps carpets looking brand new while maintaining a safe indoor environment feels like a smart decision.

1nirxb6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nirxb6,"""Best Travel CC for online purchases?""","Hey there! Let me break this down for you in a way that makes sense based on your spending habits. You mentioned you mostly spend on Amazon, gas, and coffee/food — and not a lot on rent or groceries. That tells me your ideal credit card is one that gives you strong rewards in those areas. So let’s look at the best options and how they stack up for your specific lifestyle.

# 🔝 Top Recommendation: Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card (Chase)

If you're a regular on Amazon and like to grab groceries at Whole Foods (or even buy gift cards for other stores there), this card is a **no-brainer**. Here’s what it offers:

* **5% cash back on** [**Amazon.com**](http://Amazon.com) **and Whole Foods purchases** – this is the **best rate** out there for those two retailers.
* **$150 Amazon Gift Card bonus** upon approval (only if you’re a Prime member).
* **No annual fee** (though you do need to pay for Prime).
* **0% intro APR for 15 months** on purchases and balance transfers.
* **Rewards redeemable for Amazon purchases, Chase travel, or statement credits**.

Let’s say you spend **$1,000 a month** on Amazon. At 5%, that’s **$50 in rewards every month**, or **$600 a year**. If you also hit Whole Foods a few times a month, you can add **$50–$100 more** in cash back. Plus, the sign-up bonus gives you a head start — just make sure you’re an Amazon Prime member to qualify.

If you’re already a Prime member, this is a **zero-cost way to boost your rewards**. If not, and you spend at least $1,200 on Amazon annually, the **$139 Prime fee is totally offset** by the rewards you’d earn — and that’s just from the base 5% rate, not even counting the bonus.

# 💨 Runner-Up: Chase Freedom Unlimited®

This one is great if you want flexibility and still want to maximize rewards in a few key categories. Here’s why it could be a good fit:

* **3% cash back at restaurants and drugstores** – perfect for your coffee, food, and maybe even snacks.
* **5% cash back on travel** booked through Chase (which can include gas, depending on how you plan).
* **1.5% cash back on everything else** – so if you occasionally buy other stuff online or in stores, you still get a solid return.
* **$200 sign-up bonus** after spending $500 in 3 months.
* **No annual fee** and **0% intro APR for 15 months**.

Let’s say you spend **$300 a month** at restaurants/coffee and **$200 on Amazon**. That’s **$500/month** total. You’d get:

* $300 x 3% = **$9/month** from dining
* $200 x 1.5% = **$3/month** from other purchases
* Total = **$12/month in rewards**, or **$144/year**

Not as strong as the Prime Visa, but still solid — especially if you're not a Prime member or don’t spend huge amounts on Amazon.

# 🚗 Alternative: American Express Blue Cash Preferred Card

This one is **ideal for families** or people who spend a lot on groceries and streaming services — but if that’s not your main spending, it might not be the best fit. Let’s see:

* **6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets** (but not at Walmart, Target, or Sam’s Club).
* **6% on select U.S. streaming services** (like Netflix, Disney+, etc.).
* **3% at U.S. gas stations** (not at supermarkets or big-box stores).
* **$250 sign-up bonus** after $3,000 in 6 months.
* **$95 annual fee** (waived in the first year if you hit the welcome offer).

If you spend **$300/month at gas stations** and **$200/month at restaurants/food**, you’d get:

* $300 x 3% = **$9/month** on gas
* $200 x 1.5% = **$3/month** on everything else
* Total = **$12/month in rewards**, or **$144/year**

If you also spend **$200/month at a supermarket** (like Publix or Albertsons), you’d get **$12/month extra**, making it **$264/year**. But this requires **$2,400/year at supermarkets**, which might not be your thing.

So unless you hit **$31/week at the grocery store**, this one might not be worth it for you. The Amex card is more of a **grocery + streaming** beast than a gas/Amazon/food card.

# 🟨 Simpler Option: Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card

This card is all about **simplicity and flat-rate rewards**. It gives you:

* **1.5% cash back on everything**, no categories to worry about.
* **$300 sign-up bonus** (includes $100 travel credit).
* **0% intro APR for 15 months** on purchases and balance transfers.
* **No annual fee**.
* **Rewards available in real time**, and you can redeem them for Amazon or PayPal purchases.

If you spend **$1,000/month** across all your regular purchases (Amazon, gas, food, etc.), you’ll get **$15/month in cash back**, or **$180/year**. That’s not as high as the 5% on Amazon, but it’s **consistent** and **no annual fee**. It’s a great **backup or secondary card** if you don’t want to manage multiple rewards programs.

# ✅ Your Best Strategy

Given your spending habits, the **Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature** is clearly the best option **if you’re a Prime member**. It gives you the **highest return** on your biggest spending category — and the rewards are super easy to use directly on Amazon.

If you’re **not a Prime member**, the **Chase Freedom Unlimited®** is the next best thing. It gives you **strong rewards in food/restaurant categories**, which aligns well with your spending on coffee, gas, and food.

You could also consider the **Capital One Quicksilver** as a **fallback card** if you want a no-hassle, no-fee card that just gives you a decent return on all your purchases.

# 📌 Final Tip

If you’re already a Prime member, the **Amazon Prime Rewards Visa** is worth it just for the 5% on Amazon. If not, and you spend **$3,000 in 6 months**, the **$250 Amex bonus** is tempting — but only if you can hit the grocery/gas categories.

So, anyone else feeling like the Energizer Bunny finally ran out of batteries after 50? 🐢 I mean, *sluggish* is an understatement at times! It’s like we’ve traded our youthful bounce for a comfy chair and a series of naps. 

But fear not, because I’ve got some game-changing tips that can help you kickstart your energy levels in just **three weeks**—and I promise, *no crazy diets* involved! 🥳

Here’s what I’ve got for you:

1. **Move Your Body, Even Just a Little**  
   Ever heard of “exercise snacking”? Basically, it’s just squeezing in little bits of movement throughout the day. A brisk walk around the block, a few squats while waiting for your coffee, or even a spontaneous dance party in your living room! 🎶 It's all about staying active without feeling overwhelmed.

2. **Hydration Station!**  
   Did you know that many of us walk around slightly dehydrated? Water can be a superhero for your energy levels. Try this: carry a refillable water bottle and set reminders to drink up. Trust me; you’ll feel like a new person!

3. **Give Yourself a Sleep Makeover**  
   Sleep is not just for babies! Good quality sleep is crucial, especially as we get older. Aim for a routine: go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. Create a peaceful environment. Maybe swap that late-night Netflix binge for a chapter of a good book? 📚

And listen, if you’re looking to team up with other strong folks who believe in leveling up together, check out this link: [We believe in strongest people.](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb). 

4. **Nourish Your Fuel Bunker**  
   I’m not talking about broccoli-only diets or anything! Just try to incorporate more whole foods—think colorful veggies, lean proteins, and healthy fats. It’s like giving your body the premium gas it craves. 🥑🍗

5. **Find Your Passion Projects**  
   Is there something you’ve always wanted to try but never had the time for? Maybe a new hobby or learning an instrument? Keeping your mind engaged can really boost your overall energy and new skills are so rewarding! 🎨🎸

Life doesn’t have to feel sluggish, my friends! Take these tips and sprinkle them into your daily routine for a boost of energy. But hey, what works for one might not for another, so let’s share what’s helped *you* feel more energized after 50! What’s your secret sauce?

For some context, I work in a director position at a sales-based organization. Really early this morning, we had a pretty tough call where there was a discussion over potential staff reduction and a few budget cuts given our current industrys market conditions and was an off-camera type call. 

After being on the call and speaking for about 5 minute, my right airpod died, and I'm partially deaf in my left ear (absolute blessing when sleeping next to my wife who snores haha). But I converted to my computer speakers so I could hear because it was important. 

Apparently, when I switched over my settings, Teams toggled off my mute button. A few minutes later, I had my feet kicked up on my desk drinking coffee and just listening. 

But, last night my wife and I had a nice dinner at a Mexican restaurant last night and that swelling up feeling where I knew I was going to have a massive fart was coming to fruition. 

When it hit terminal capacity, this thing was a full on 8-second aggressive sound followed by 5 seconds of ""machine gun"" popping after. It was nice until the speaker stopped and said there was ""audio interference""

I understand now that audio was clearly emitted to about 20 people and I had a good colleague tell me after how phenomenally clear it was. 

I genuinely feel awful. It was a tough conversation for myself and everyone on that call. I just had a howitzer fart saved in the chamber lol. 

TLDR: was on an early morning leadership call discussijg layoffs and had Mexican food last so I let off a legendary gnarly  fart my entire leadership team got to hear because I unmuted when I put my headphones away.

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands — ideally near Amsterdam, but anywhere not too far works too!

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit — but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you — whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer — picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dreams — I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener — friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me — I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle, genuine connection with — whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends — movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine — your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh — I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

Like 5 months ago we were out having a coffee and last day I sent him a lot of reels on instagram but it wasn’t even on seen, I thought he was busy and couldn’t check his dms, but when we were together he opened his dms on instagram and there were conversations with his friends above mine, mine being not read. I also saw some suspicious profile above my messages, with no profile pic too. I asked him why he did had conversations with so many people but not me, and who was the sus profile. He said it was no one important and just called someone from his workplace and had a longass conversation with him, during while I was overthinking stuff. When he hung up I asked again and wanted to just look at that profile, he said ok and gave me his phone but the conversation was gone. He deleted it and told me there wasn’t anything like that to begin with. I remembered the account name so I just searched it from my own account and saw a few of his friends also follow the account. I called two of friends later to ask about it, one of them told me it was his alt account that he uses just to send reels and follow meme accounts and I believed him, but later, that friend, he called me back and told me it wasn’t actually his account and he told me that so me and my bf wouldn’t have an argument about it. I asked my bf a lot of times about it, he never told me, and I told him I just lost my trust in him, and wouldn’t be able to trust him easily after this, he tried everything to make me happy after this, and told a lot of things about that account being their fake account with his friends and they were just using it to send dumb posts to each other etc. Eventually I forgave him and are still together but now I really can’t trust anything he says or does.

I generally try and keep my FOMODs up to date, not so much the 50 or 200 standalone files that might be on the same page. Obviously FOMODs are better for individual users (and me, to keep track!), so I'm not going to stop doing that, but if someone is using a collection, they probably aren't going to (realise they can) leave a comment for *me* if there's a problem.

I've been at my current job for about 3 months now, and im still learning how things work since this is my first office job after only being in retail. Obviously, my boss know my assigned sex because of my application and is completely okay with me presenting as I do. I havent told anyone in the office what my sex is and neither has my boss, she said that it's my choice and im very thankful for that. When interacting with my coworkers, I let them use whatever pronouns they want for me, I answer to any and just let them use whatever feels comfortable for them. This means I get called multiple sets of pronouns daily, I get included in boy vs girl competitions based on who grabs me first (all friendly), and i get to use a single stall bathroom if needed.

The problem thats come up is two of my coworkers have been very curious about my assigned sex. At first it was genuine curiosity, which i get since not everyone has experience with trans people, especially nonbinary people, so I politely declined to share and said why. The topic seemed to be dropped and aside from some light jokes about wanting to know, it hadnt been brought up. 

In the past few weeks they have been asking again with less of a joking tone. I still respond kindly, but instead of dropping it they ask why i wont tell and ask things like ""dont you trust us?"" and ""we're friends right?"" which is confusing since we have been getting closer. im not the best socially but my coworkers (i'll call them Ben and Riley) have been including me in things other than group office activities. We usually eat lunch together, and occasionally get coffee or dinner before and after work. I do consider us friends but i still dont want to tell anyone my assigned sex, ive said im more comfortable when most people dont know outside of doctors and such. I tried to make it clear that it wasnt about trust and that i do consider us friends and appreciate them, this was just a boundary I have but Ben wasnt having it.

Last week we had lunch together and Ben asked really explicitly what my sex was. It caught me off guard so I didnt say anything for a few moments. Riley laughed it off and I thought he was gonna change the subject, but he asked too, in a nicer way? He said him and Ben couldn't stop thinking about it and wanted to be closer as friends and felt that me telling them would do that. I said again that I wasnt ready to share and that made them really upset. Ben got up and paid for lunch and left for his car. I thought he left us (he drove us there) but he was waiting in the parking lot. The drive back to work was really tense and before leaving the car to continue work, Riley put a hand on my shoulder and said that it hurts them that I dont trust them.

Since then they havent been talking to me at work. I catch them watching me and they make a point to walk by my desk, I sit far from them, but we dont talk. I'm starting to think im really hurting them and I dont want to mess things up at the office, I really need this job and I dont want work to be something I dread.

tl;dr I won't tell anyone at work my assigned sex at birth. this has made the friends I have at work upset. am I the jerk for not telling them my assigned sex",2,1758051991.0,AmITheJerk,9,0.63,False

I just want to provide a bit of insight and background about myself before I really dive into what kind of help I'm looking for here.

I'm 26 years old, (recently) unemployed and I currently have no college degree. I attempted college from the ages of 18-21 but truly never went anywhere far with it (basically dropped out with 0 completed credits) because I lacked any sense of direction and only kept myself enrolled to satisfy my parent's need for me to be in school. During those years, I was also working within the food service industry, following my mother's footsteps as she's been a server pretty much all my life, but after my 24th birthday I decided for myself that I could no longer stand working in the food industry, it no longer resonated with me anymore and I wanted to begin exploring my own best interests. 

The problem here is, I feel like all I've ever known and experienced was anything food and service related. I grew up in the restaurants my mom worked in and was raised/influenced by all of her coworkers, and even most of my friends fell into the same lifestyle. It's a great hustle and paid well, but I always felt like it was so ingenuine to who I actually am and what I envisioned myself doing as an adult. 

I've always thought of myself and expressed to others that I'm a creative-leaning person. I grew up enjoying playing instruments, drawing, dancing, and later in life I tapped into fashion as an outlet, but none of these hobbies ever developed further into just minor hobbies. I can confidently say that my skills in all of these hobbies are subpar at best, as I haven't found many people that support me and my interests in a way to  push myself further. I'm pretty much the only creative one in my mom's side of the family so it scares me a bit to deviate from the rest of them- I've always felt pressured to fall into financing or business because that's what everyone else besides my mom did.

For the last couple of years, anytime someone would ask me what my dream job is, I'd tell them that I would love to own a thrift/consignment store that would also include a tea/coffee bar, with lounging areas for people to play/listen to music, create art, or just gather and use as a third space.

It sounds a bit ridiculous as I type it out, and even more so when I voice that dream out loud to others only for it to be shot down here and there. I'm fairly certain that that's just not a reality I'll be able to make happen without building up my career and finances through a different route beforehand. Some jobs that have piqued my interest these days are either museum related, at a dispensary, certain thrift/vintage shops, a florist, a library assistant, and a few others to name, but honestly something just really chill for the time being and pays enough for the bills that I have and the hobbies I want to delve deeper into.

So, to my fellow INFPs, is there any advice you can share or steps you would encourage me to take? Is it unrealistic to want to live such a different lifestyle than what has been laid out for me by others who helped me build this life? What are some of your dreams/goals for yourself and what steps have you taken to achieve them?

If you've taken the time to read this, thank you for doing so. This INFP struggle is hard, but I have hope that there's a happy and fulfilling outcome waiting at the end of all of my turmoil. I'm just struggling to figure out where square one even starts and what to do from there.

1nirlnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Bench-Warmer45/comments/1nirlnn/best_compact_juicer_out_there_on_a_budget/,Best compact juicer out there (on a budget),"So I’ve been slowly dragging myself toward healthier choices (trying not to live on iced coffee), and a proper juicer was on the list for FOREVER. Problem was, most cold press juicers are either gigantic or cost more than my weekly grocery budget(im a college student btw).

I checked walmart and target but god the stuff there is expensive af so i came back to good old amazon lol. Found [this compact kind](https://videoguidelines.com/dp-B0DGTS3M73) from inoviva and it lowkey surprised me compared to most others I saw. It’s small like fits-in-a-tote small but the blades do the job way better than I'd expect from that price. (huge plus: it comes in the prettiest pink shade)

Also a side note, I had a mini juicer back when I started college and thought it’d be enough, but it was way too compact to make a good serving. Ended up juicing 3x just to fill one glass. So I learned my lesson, juicer needs to be compact but still big enough to give a full big glass.

Compared to my last, here's what i think is better in this one:

* compact and lightweight, works well for small kitchens or carrying it around
* 70 rpm slow juicing so it doesn’t kill nutrients (less foamy juice too)-very important imo
* barely any pulp waste
* easy to clean, everything clicks apart (and dishwasher safe)

Not saying it’s going to outdo a $300 nama juicer, but for the price (under $40), it’s honestly a great intro if you’re just starting with juicing or want something portable for travel, small spaces, or even dorm life.

I went to Trader Joes with my gf, and I felt like I had 4 cups of coffee.. honestly felt kinda high and super stimulated for next couple hours.

I hadn't felt my medication feel this intense since I had started it like 6 months ago. 

I know Grapefruit juice can impact how your body processes certain medications but does concentrated Cranberry juice do something similar?

Is this safe to take together?

The one who'd remember her coffee order, who'd drive an hour in the middle of the night to pick her up when her car broke down. The one who’d put his own needs on the back burner, convinced that if he was good enough, kind enough, selfless enough, he would finally earn the love and loyalty he craved.

But it never happened. He watched from the sidelines as she fell for a guy who was aloof, who never called when he said he would, who kept her guessing. And she'd chase him, desperately, passionately, with a fire she'd never once shown to him.

She, in her own world, saw it too. She was the one who was always there, the listening ear, the shoulder to cry on. She was patient and understanding, while her friends chased after men who were exciting, unpredictable, and yes, often unkind. She’d seen them pine over guys who’d flake on dates, who'd flirt with other women in front of them, who offered nothing but a rollercoaster of emotional highs and lows.

And in her quiet moments, she’d wonder why she, who offered a steady, reliable love, was so often overlooked. Why did the bad boys, the ones who seemed to care the least, get the devotion and loyalty that she herself had to fight for?

It seemed to be a universal law, a cruel cosmic joke. The more you gave, the less it was valued. The more you were willing to sacrifice, the less you were appreciated. It was as if kindness was a currency with no value, a weakness to be exploited.

They were both too soft for the world they lived in. Too genuine for a game of emotional manipulation. They were the good ones, the ones who deserved to be treated with respect and adoration. But for some reason, the world seemed to reward the opposite. And as they both looked at their lonely reflections, they couldn’t help but wonder if they were the problem. Was their kindness their biggest flaw? Was being ""good"" the reason they were always left behind, watching as the bad boys and the rebels received the love they deserved?",1,1758051647.0,u_Parking_Tiger_9703,0,1.0,False

1niriwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/kolkata/comments/1niriwy/motorcycle_trip_to_mukutmonipur_west_bengal_from/,"Motorcycle trip to Mukutmonipur, West Bengal from Kolkata","The past couple of months at the office were nothing short of chaotic. Add to that the constant, depressing rain this year, and you can imagine, I barely had a moment to breathe, even on weekends. So when I suddenly lost access to the cloud platform I’d been working on, I let out an audible sigh of relief. No more work for the weekend!

Without wasting a second, I shot a message to my riding buddies. A weekend ride was happening, and the plan was simple: *somewhere* out of Kolkata. Within a day, planning, bookings, everything was set.

The plan? Start early in the morning, leave Kolkata before the city even wakes up, grab breakfast in Medinipur where another rider would join us, then cruise down to Mukutmonipur by lunchtime. After that, it was all about chilling at the dam.

Saturday morning, four of us gathered at the tea stall near Dhulagarh toll plaza around 5:15 AM. In our group, we had two Triumph 400X, one CB350, and my trusty NX500. We spotted a massive group of riders, members of the *Riders Community of Bengal* on Facebook. We let them take the lead, figuring it was better not to get stuck in a sea of bikes. Meanwhile, we connected our intercoms and had a hot cup of coffee to kick things off.

By 6:00 AM, we were on the road to Medinipur. The ride was smooth, and we pulled into SalPiyal Restaurant for a breakfast stop by 7:30. Another rider joined us here, also on an NX500, and we were ready to fuel up for the next leg of the journey.

After filling our stomachs and the bikes, we hit the road by 8:30. Our first official stop? Bardi Pahar Eco Resort in Bankura. A quick dip in the river behind the resort, a few laughs, and we were back on the road toward Mukutmonipur. By 1:30 PM, we rolled into the Peerless Resort, our stop for the night.

After checking in, we headed straight for the dam. Fun fact: Mukutmonipur boasts one of the largest earthen dams in India. We had a 30 minute boating session on the water, followed by a ride across the dam itself. Naturally, we paused for a mobile photography session

By 8:30 PM, we were back at the resort, swapping stories and enjoying some good ‘adda’. The night ended with a well-earned rest, and we were out by 11:00 PM.

Sunday morning, we checked out by 10:00 AM, ready for the return leg. First stop: Sutan Forest. After that, we looped back through Belpahari and Gidhni, avoiding the traffic chaos of Jhargram city by taking the Chichra route to the NH-49. The last 20 km before the highway was an absolute disaster, bumpy and nearly non-existent, but once we hit the NH, it was smooth sailing.

https://preview.redd.it/fwk9vlrfykpf1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=7658eb23f6fd1fc6b4e3acda1e172de5d650ed24

We cruised from Chichra at 2:45 PM, and by 4:45 PM, we were breezing through Kolaghat. After a longish tea break, we finally reached home by 7:30 PM.

Mission accomplished. The weekend ride turned out to be the perfect escape.

Oh, and I had a chance to test out some new gear on this trip. I recently bought the RS Taichi Drymaster Kompass jacket and pants, and this was my first ride in them. The gear is super light, but by design, it lets in very little air. I was sweating buckets the entire way, definitely something to get used to.

Long long story but I’ve been unwell for last 8 days with suspected ibs flare. Not ate anything or drank in 8 days.  Over the last week I’ve had multiple bags of fluid with glucose due to high ketones. My GP sent me back to hospital today but they have discharged me saying there is nothing more they can do for me at this time. My blood ketones are currently 3.9 this is believed to be from starvation. I’ve not drank anything and decided to have a couple sips of cola 5 minutes ago- then I vomited 5 minutes later. The fluid was cola coloured but it was filled with hundred of dark brown flecks and stringy brown bits. This can’t be the cola can it? It looked like a coffee ground vomit and I haven’t taken any medication apart from paracetamol. As I said before I’ve also not ate in 8 days. For context In the hospital today I was pyrexial and my heart rate was sitting at 154. My blood tests came back as normal apparently also. I have slight throbbing pain in the middle left hand side of my back and had a slight pain when the doctor pressed on my stomach between my ribs.

With a dishwasher that seems to get more use than my coffee maker, finding a detergent that can tackle daily challenges while being effective is no small task. This product was put through quite the ringer in my kitchen, handling everything from greasy lasagna pans to dried oatmeal bowls. It’s clear there’s a lot to love, but also a couple of nuances worth mentioning.

**Effectiveness and Cleaning Power**  
One of the standout features of this dishwasher powder is its ability to cut through tough, baked-on grime. I tested it on a casserole dish that I shamefully left out for two days after making some cheesy pasta. To my surprise, it came out looking pristine without any pre-wash scrubbing. The grease-fighting power of the Dawn formula, a key selling point of this detergent, truly delivers. It works wonders on both delicate glassware and sturdy stainless steel pots. Unlike some detergents that leave a cloudy residue, this powder left everything sparkling clean.

[Check Cascade Complete Powder Dishwasher Detergent B00IJGC3FM price on Amazon.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b00ijgc3fm/)

**Ease of Use**  
As someone who values simplicity, I appreciated the no-pre-wash requirement. Sometimes it feels like pre-washing completely defeats the purpose of owning a dishwasher. This powder takes that hassle away. I just loaded the dishwasher, added the detergent, and hit the start button. No mess, no fuss. Additionally, the resealable container is a small but thoughtful touch. It helps prevent the powder from clumping over time, which is an issue I’ve had with other brands.

**Positives**  
A few noteworthy highlights of this product include:  
- Exceptional grease and stuck-on food removal.  
- Convenient, resealable container for long-term storage.  
- Leaves dishes free of residue or watermarks.  

**Negatives**  
Despite its impressive cleaning capabilities, there are some caveats to keep in mind:  
- The powder is a bit on the finer side, which made it slightly messy to measure out at times.  
- The scent, though fresh, felt a bit too strong for me during the dishwashing process, although it doesn’t linger on dishes afterward.  

**Durability and Quantity**  
At 75 ounces, this box lasted my family of four about a month and a half with daily use. Compared to using pods, the powder offers a bit more flexibility in how much product you want to use. For lighter loads, I could use just a bit less, which made this feel like a more economical option. However, I couldn’t help noticing that on extra-heavy loads, I ended up using a little extra for peace of mind.

**Competing Products**  
When comparing this detergent to other household staples like Finish Quantum or Seventh Generation’s dishwasher tablets, it’s a game of trade-offs. Finish Quantum is arguably better at delivering a shine on glassware, but it doesn’t handle greasy dishes as effortlessly as this powder. Meanwhile, eco-conscious products like Seventh Generation may feel more environmentally responsible but lack the deep-cleaning power for tough loads. Cascade’s powder finds a solid middle ground between superior cleaning and the ability to handle various dishwashing needs.  

**Value for Money**  
The price-to-quality ratio feels right here, especially considering the versatility of the powder format versus individual pods. It’s satisfying to know that you're not overpaying for packaging and convenience. Plus, when you use it strategically for different load intensities, it stretches further than most competitors. There’s real financial value hidden in not needing a backup rinse-aid or pre-wash routine. I don’t need extra steps or add-ons for the same results.

Sharing the recipe I use, in case anyone wants to try it. :)

Ingredients:

* 15g medium roast coffee
* 50g water at 92 °C
* 120g ice
* 180g soda (sparkling water) or tonic water

Equipment:

* Aeropress (inverted method)
* Timemore C2 Updated grinder (setting 12)
* Stirring stick
* Glass

Method:

1. Grind 15g of coffee at setting 12 on the Timemore C2 Upgrade grinder (medium-fine grind).
2. Set up your Aeropress in the inverted position.
3. Add the ground coffee to the Aeropress.
4. Pour 50g of water at 92°C (198°F) over the grounds.

Except I am sure it's still not PERFECTLY parallel to the floor. Okay, the table and floor are now MORE parallel to each other than before the repair. Great! Except that doesn't really convey much information, and I didn't bother to measure the before and after. Okay, the table and floor are now SIGNIFICANTLY more parallel than before I made the repair. Great! That will impress the wife! Except she will wonder why I didn't just say the table is now level....

Then I keep coming back to the fact that neither the table nor the floor are ideal planes. They're both amorphous three dimensional blobs, so any talk of them being parallel isn't very meaningful. What does parallel even mean in a three dimensional world...

1nir9lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1nir9lw/falling_under_a_story_by_jasinda_wilder_read/,Falling Under: A Story by Jasinda Wilder Read online," I fucking hate being the new guy. It sucks. You'd think I'd be used to it by now, but I'm not. Mom's always moving us--every year or so, a new city, a new school. I wish I knew what she was looking for, who she was running from. Hiding from. Herself, I think. It's like everywhere we go, something spooks her. I've attended a new school every year since seventh grade. St. Louis for seventh grade, Denver for eighth, Biloxi for ninth, Atlantic City for tenth, Rochester, New York, in eleventh grade. Atlanta for my senior year.  
  
  So, yeah, I know all about being the new guy. But thankfully, college, especially community college, means everybody is new. Few people know each other, so there aren't roving packs of kids who have all known each other since kindergarten. I can fade into the background here, which is nice. A good change. I approve.  
  
  I started taking classes at the community college in Atlanta, and managed to get in a full year and two semesters before Mom decided to uproot us again, bouncing around until we finally settled in Nashville. So I had no choice; I had to transfer. Which means retaking a few classes that didn't transfer, play catch-up. I'm already behind. I'm twenty-one. I should be almost done with my bachelor's, but I'm not even halfway through my associate's. It's bullshit. I told her no more moves until I at least finish my fucking associate's. Give me at least that long.  
  
  You'd think I'd be out on my own, that I would've just stayed in Atlanta and finished there, and let Mom go wherever the hell she wanted. I thought about it, I really did. I thought about it long and hard. But in the end, I had to go with her. We're all each other have. She struggles just to make ends meet, and that's with me helping out, contributing whatever income I can. She needs me. So...hello, Nashville.  
  
  I slump into the back row in my first class, calculus. It's absurdly remedial for me, but I have to take it as a prerequisite for more advanced classes. I wish this was something more advanced than what amounts to high school math. I taught myself this shit in ninth grade. Math is calming for me. It's freakish, I know, but sitting down to work through a bunch of equations quiets the chaos in my head, helps me deal with the constant fluctuation of my moods.  
  
  All the other people in this class are the type you'd expect--buttoned-up, backs straight, notebooks out, pencils scribbling. Everything but pocket protectors, most of 'em. Okay, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration. Most of them are just like me, here to satisfy a prereq. Then there's her. Holy hell. She's in the front row, far right side of the room. Sitting facing slightly sideways, so I get a profile view of her strawberry blonde hair and the most electric pair of blue eyes I've ever seen. Jesus. My pulse is pounding, and she's not even looking at me. She seems as bored as I am, too. Slumped back in her chair, twirling a lock of her long-ass hair around a fingernail, chewing gum, elbow on the desk, idly doodling on her notebook, not really paying attention. As if she knows everything Dr. Stuffypants up there is saying. I can't take my eyes off her. I'm mesmerized.  
  
  I slide lower in my chair, embarrassed at my own crazy reaction to some girl I don't even know. Everybody knows girls like the bad boys, and I'm thoroughly bad. So I've never had issues getting a girl to hang with me. But I've never had my pulse race and thunder in my ears, never had my palms sweat. Never wanted to stand up, cross the room, and beg for her name, her number, for five fucking minutes alone with her.  
  
  I fish my earbuds from my pocket, stick one in my ear, turning away from the room so it's hidden from easy view. Hit ""play"" and crank up the volume. ""Monolith"" by Stone Sour fills my ear, and it tunes out the grumbling, droning voice of the teacher. I flip open a tattered Nashville Public Library copy of a book on string theory.  
  
  The class passes slowly, and I glance up at the board to keep pace with what they're covering. Nothing I can't do in my sleep, so far. The class ends, eventually, and the students shuffle out, chattering and laughing and glancing at me. The girl with the strawberry blonde hair pauses by my desk.  
  
  ""It's not polite to stare."" She tosses her thick mane of reddish-blonde hair over her shoulder. ""What's your name?""  
  
  I shrug. ""I'm not polite. Name's Oz.""  
  
  She frowns. ""Oz? That's what's on your birth certificate?""  
  
  ""Does it make a difference?""  
  
  ""No, but--""  
  
  She's interrupted by the professor. ""Get moving, you two. I've got another class coming in.""  
  
  Students are filing in, finding seats early, even though the next class doesn't start for another ten minutes. We both leave the room, and I slip away before she can pester me about my name anymore. She's just a chick, nothing to get worked up about. I make my way to my next class, a fairly generic world history course. Not bad, but boring. As I'm about to go in, I see the girl chatting with a couple of friends. I swerve and beeline over to her. Just to prove to myself that my over-the-top reaction earlier was just a fluke.  
  
  ""I never got your name."" I don't really notice her friends, even though they're both pretty.  
  
  Okay, so I saw them, but they're just...there. Good-looking enough. But not even in the same galaxy of hotness as this girl. They're eyeing me, but I ignore them completely. I'm fixated on this redhead with the hypnotic blue eyes.  
  
  ""And I didn't get yours."" She lifts an eyebrow.  
  
  I roll my eyes. ""Name's Oz. I've gone by Oz since the third grade. Not even my mom calls me by the name on my birth certificate.""  
  
  ""Which is what?""  
  
  I shake my head in irritation and disbelief. ""Why do you care?""  
  
  She shrugs. ""I'm curious.""  
  
  ""So what's your name?""  
  
  She shakes her head. ""I'll tell you mine when you tell me yours."" The way her eyes light up, the brightness of her smile makes something in my chest thump a little too hard.  
  
  I  
walk into class, grinning at her over my shoulder. ""Have it your way, then.""  
  
  I have one more class, an early American literature class. Gag me. Give me Hemingway or Faulkner or any of those guys any day, but this stuffy Puritan crap? No thanks.  
  
  On the way out of school, I see her again. She's hugging a big, muscular guy wearing a Vanderbilt Commodores ball cap. He's got dark-tanned skin and close-cropped black hair, and the kind of build that fairly screams ""football player."" Shit. She's hugging him like she's known him forever, and I feel a stupid thread of jealousy ripple through me. I just met her, don't even know her first name. So what business do I have being jealous? He's obviously here to pick her up, judging by the fact that she's opening the passenger door of his shiny, black, jacked-up Silverado and tossing her backpack in like it's her own car.  
  
  I really should just forget I ever met her, take off, and go about my business. Except, jock boy has his monster truck parked by my bike. I act like I don't see them. Zip up my leather jacket, cinch the straps of my backpack, tug my Broncos hat off my head, stuff it into a saddlebag, and pop my helmet onto my head, click the strap beneath my chin. I know she's seen me now, feel her gaze on me as she leans against the truck, chatting with her friend/boyfriend/whoever the hell he is.  
  
  I swing my leg over, kick the stand up, twist the key so the engine rumbles to life. It's a 2003 Indian Spirit Roadmaster Cruiser. It's my baby. I bought it with cash my senior year of high school. From the time I was twelve, I mowed lawns, shoveled snow, delivered newspapers, washed dishes, did any kind of odd job I could find, to buy it. Took me almost six years to save up enough for it. It was the only thing I'd ever wanted: my own motorcycle. Mom hated the idea, but after she saw that I was serious about saving every penny, she couldn't say no. She even pitched in a few hundred bucks along the way. Then I'd seen one on the side of the road with a ""for sale"" sign on it. I passed it every day on the way to my job at the Mexican restaurant. Teasing me. The owner wanted $8,500 for it, and I only had $8,100. So Mom, being Mom, told me she'd help me out, as long as I agreed to always wear my helmet, no matter what the helmet law of the state we were living in. Easy enough.  
  
  The rumble of the engine is sexy as hell. The original owner--a real-deal biker in a biker gang--beefed it up, made it loud, made it fast. Put saddlebags on it, and even sold me his own personal helmet, one of those that look like the German helmets from World War One, with a spike on the top. Pretty badass, if I do say so myself. Plus, I found a leather jacket in a pawn shop in Louisville that had a bunch of patches and shit on it, so I looked the part even more. I've put some of my own patches on the jacket, metal band logos and such.  
  
  I let the engine rumble, then start rolling the heavy bike backward. I walk it around so my front end is facing the exit to the parking lot, and then gun the engine, creating an ear-splitting roar. I feel her looking at me, feel her wondering if I'm going to say something. I think again about taking off, ending this little flirtation I've got with her.  
  
  But then, fuck it, I cast a cocky grin at Blue Eyes. ""You coming?"" I reach behind me and snag the spare helmet I keep hanging off the back of the seat.  
  
  She stares at me, and I can see she wants to. She's curious. I keep my grin easy and arrogant. Inside, my heart is thudding.  
  
  ""Ky, no,"" the guy says. She ignores him and moves toward me. He grabs at her arm. ""Kylie, I said no.""  
  
  I put the kickstand down. ""I wasn't asking you. I was asking her. Let go of her.""  
  
  He steps toward me, and he seems to swell up as I say, ""Or what?""  
  
  I don't really want to tangle with this guy. He's big, and he looks quick. It'll hurt, and probably screw my chances with this girl all to hell, but hey, why not. Except...I don't want to fight. I want to go on a ride with her.  
  
  I ignore the jock's challenge and glance at her. ""Kylie, huh? Suits you."" I wink at her. ""So. You coming or what, sweetness?""  
  
  She glances back at the guy, and then at me. She nods. ""Sure. But don't call me sweetness.""  
  
  ""Fair enough.""  
  
  ""Goddammit, Kylie. You don't know this guy. Stay here."" Jock reaches for her, but she steps out of his reach, swings her leg over the bike, behind me.  
  
  She glares at him. ""I'll be fine, Ben."" She settles the helmet on her head, unconcerned about her hair getting messy. Which is hot.  
  
  ""So I drove all the way here to pick you up, and you're just gonna ditch me like this?"" He sounds pissed and, honestly, he's got a reason. Not that I care.  
  
  I don't wait. As soon as she's on behind me, I kick the bike into gear and gun the engine. We jump forward, and a delighted squeak from behind me has me grinning. Her hands go around my stomach, holding on more tightly. Oh, shit. I can feel her against me. Every inch. Her tits are squished against my chest, and her arms are tight around my waist, and her thighs are wedged by my hips. We rumble out of the parking lot, and then as soon as I hit the asphalt of the main road, I twist the throttle and we rocket away. She's silent after that, but I can feel her excitement. I share it. Riding never gets old, not ever. The wind in my face, the freedom, the road so close under me, the speed. It's addictive. And now, this chick is holding onto me, and it feels even more so. I mean, sure, I've had other girls on the bike with me, but it never felt like this. I've had exactly three conversations with her, each lasting less than a minute, but there's something about her.  
  
  I head to a spot I found yesterday, a little cafe not far from the Vanderbilt campus. It's got good coffee, and killer chili cheese fries. I pull into the parking lot, cut off the engine, and hold my hand out. Kylie takes it, and I feel a tingle. Her smile, as I help her swing off the bike, is surprised, as if a guy like me couldn't possibly know anything about manners. Except I've been raised by a single mom, and she expects me to do that shit. For her, and for everyone. I've never had a dad, so she's tried to teach me things she thinks a man should know. Like how to be a gentleman. Kylie hangs the helmet on the handle, and I do the same with my own helmet and my jacket, not bothering to hide my stare as she arches backward to run her fingers through her hair, and then ties it back with a ponytail holder from her wrist. God, she's gorgeous. Willowy, but with lush curves. And Jesus, that hair. On the red side of strawberry blonde, with the milk-white skin to match, a spattering of freckles across her nose. Her eyes meet mine, catching me staring, and I don't look away, don't let an ounce of apology enter my eyes. I was perusing all of her, not just her assets. I'm not going to apologize for looking at a beautiful woman, especially when I wasn't just staring at her tits or something. Which I do get a good look at, because holy hell, are they perfect. She's got this preppy country girl thing going on, girly cowboy boots, skintight faded jeans, a pale pink plaid shirt with slim, rolled-up sleeves, a blingy belt with a wide buckle. The shirt is unbuttoned to show just a hint of cleavage, but it's enough to see that she's got a rack to die for. Big, round, firm, high. Not huge, but probably a soft and tasty handful. I jerk my eyes back to her face, to her breathtaking blue eyes.  
  
  She looks me over. I'm tall, over six-four, almost six-five. I'm not an athlete or a workout buff, but I stay in shape, so I'm more lean than anything. Shoulder-length auburn hair pulled back low on my neck. Tanned, swarthy skin, a long hooked nose, brownish-gray eyes. I've got tattoos, an image of a road on my left forearm, two lanes, the double-stripe down the middle and lines on either side. It's done in shades of gray, going from the base of my wrist up to my elbow. I've got some tribal designs on my left bicep, and on my right forearm I have a few lines of lyrics from Metallica's ""Wherever I May Roam."" The words are inscribed horizontally, done to look like someone had hand-written them there just a moment before, the ink glossy black and almost wet-looking. Pair that with old, faded, ripped blue jeans and scuffed combat boots, and I look every inch a biker.  
  
  After our mutual stare-fest is over, I hold the door open, and I'm once again treated to a surprised smile and a stunned ""thank you.""  
  
  We sit down in a corner booth. She orders Coke, and I get coffee and an order of chili cheese fries. ""You wa  
nt something to eat?"" I ask her. I grabbed my hat from my saddlebag as I swung off the bike, and I cram it backward onto my head, to cover up my helmet hair.  
  
  ""What you're getting sounds fine,"" she says.  
  
  ""Then we'll share,"" I say. She just nods, and I decide to get a feel for the lay of the land. ""So, that guy, Ben. Your boyfriend?""  
  
  ""No!"" she protests, a little too quickly, I think. She seems to realize it, too, and calms down immediately. ""No. We grew up together. Our parents are best friends. We've lived across the street from each other since kindergarten.""  
  
  ""He seemed awful protective of you. A little too much for just friends.""  
  
  She flicks at her straw with her tongue. It's hot, and distracting. I watch her tongue rather than her face, and I wonder what she can do with that tongue of hers. I almost miss what she's saying. ""...always been protective. He looks out for me, that's all.""  
  
  I stir my coffee, more to get myself to stop watching her tongue and her lips than because it needs stirring. ""Looks at you, maybe. He wanted to kill me when you got on my bike. I did steal you from him.""  
  
  Her eyes darken, and she frowns. ""Yeah, that's probably not gonna go over well, later.""  
  
  ""I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble,"" I say.  
  
  She shrugs. ""Nah. He'll just be pissy. Why are we talking about Ben, anyway? Don't you have a pick-up line to use on me?""  
  
  I grin. ""I already used it, sweetness.""  
  
  She narrows her eyes at me. ""Don't call me that.""  
  
  ""Why not?""  
  
  ""I don't like it,"" she says.  
  
  ""Yes, you do,"" I say.  
  
  She opens her mouth to protest again, but the waitress brings over my fries, which become our fries as Kylie reaches out and snags one. She tips her head back and takes a bite, chili and cheese dripping onto her chin. She even eats sexily. It's unreal. The chili on her chin has to be scorching, and she's trying to unwrap the napkin, but can't get the sticky strip of paper undone. I don't even think about it. I just reach out and brush the chili off with my thumb. Dumbass. But...damn, her skin is soft. And then, deliberately, I lick my thumb. Also stupid, and reckless, and bad for everyone involved.

  She's fixated on me, as if she can't believe what just happened. I can't, either. I don't know what came over me. I'm not the charm-and-smarm kinda guy. A girl hangs with me, she knows what's up. Mom and I, we're nomads. We don't stay anywhere long. So any relationship I have is, by nature, short-lived. Not gonna waste time on silly mush bullshit, like making a chick think I love her.  
  
  So why did I do that, touch her with my thumb that way? Sure, she's hot, but it's not like I'm staying in Nashville for long. A few semesters, finish out the degree. That's it. So...what the hell, Oz?  
  
  I got nothin'.  
  
  ""Where are you from, Oz?"" she asks, by way of breaking the awkwardness.  
  
  I hate that question. ""All over the place.""  
  
  ""Your dad in the military or something?"" She says it so innocently, no way of knowing how bitter I am about the topic of fathers.  
  
  I shrug, trying to keep the ever-present fury from my voice; it ain't her fault. ""No. Just Mom and me. And we just move a lot. Various reasons."" I don't know why, is the real answer, but I'm not about to say that to this chick.  
  
  ""You never knew your dad?"" She levels a look at me, wiping at her cheek with her napkin. Her eyes are assessing, reading me, piercing me.  
  
  I shake my head. It's all she'll get out of me. ""You got both your folks?""  
  
  She nods. ""Yep.""  
  
  ""What do they do?"" I'm not just asking to get her off the topic of dads; I'm genuinely interested. Another bad sign.  
  
  Her eyes light up, and I envy her that joy. ""They're musicians. They're Nell and Colt. They were signed to Columbia for a while, but they're indie now. They have their own record label, and they actually just signed their first new artist.""  
  
  I'm a little impressed, actually. I know Nell and Colt. I'm a metalhead and will be till the day I die, but I've got a secret soft spot for singer/songwriter music. Thanks to my Mom, mainly. So we have music we can listen to together. She's into hip-hop and pop and country, a bunch of stupid bullshit that I can't stand. I had to find middle ground, so we could listen to music in the car on cross-country moves. Nell and Colt are pretty big in the singer/songwriter world, actually. I call it coffeehouse music, the kinda stuff you hear in little one-off hipster joints where they do art with the latte foam.  
  
  ""I've heard of 'em,"" I say. ""I like 'em.""  
  
  Kylie blinks in surprise. ""You--you have?"" Her gaze flicks to my shirt, which features a skull with a rose growing from it, and a raven perched on the skull.  
  
  I wink at her. ""I'm full of surprises, sweetness.""  
  
  She sighs. ""Stop winking at me. And stop calling me 'sweetness.'""  
  
  ""You know that's just gonna make me do it more, right?"" I wink at her again, exaggerated. ""Sweetness.""  
  
  She shakes her head, laughing. ""Who even winks, anyway? I mean, really? Winking? Isn't that for creepy uncles?""  
  
  I laugh. ""I'm not a creepy uncle. But maybe you're right.""  
  
  ""I know I'm right. That's why I said it. Duh."" She stuffs another cheese fry in her mouth, and again chili smears on the corner of her mouth.  
  
  I can't help it. My hand reaches out by itself. My thumb touches her cheek, but her fingers encircle my wrist. Our eyes lock, my gray-brown eyes on her bluest blue, electric, fiery blue.  
  
  ""Don't,"" she whispers.  
  
  ""Why?"" I match her volume; I don't know why.  
  
  ""I don't like it.""  
  
  ""You lie, sweetness. And why are we whispering?"" I say it all sotto voce, and I know I sound stupid, using lines like that on her, but they just slip out.  
  
  I shouldn't be doing this, shouldn't be acting like this chick could ever mean anything to me, or I to her. She's got rich, famous parents. I mean, they're not famous, but if you listen to the right kind of music, you've heard of 'em. They've even gotten some country station cross-over airplay. The point is, I'm a nobody drifter, with a nobody drifter mom. And Kylie? She's got roots here in Nashville. Friends, family, the works.  
  
  She leans away from me, wipes at her face with a napkin. Slides out of the booth. ""I've gotta pee.""  
  
  I pay the bill while she's gone, and polish off the plate of fries. The girl did a number on them, to my surprise. The chicks I've known wouldn't have gone to town on something like cheese fries, so watching her eat happily and with obvious pleasure was interesting. And hot. Yes, I'm noticing a pattern here. Anything she does is hot. The way she slipped out of the booth, for example. It was graceful, a sleek, elegant motion. No jerking or hopping or awkward movements, just a smooth slide, and then she was off across the cafe with a sway to her ass.  
  
  When she came back, I stood up to meet her. ""Ready?"" I ask.  
  
  She glances at the table, at the small pile of ones I left as a tip. ""You paid already?""  
  
  ""Of course.""  
  
  A third time I get the surprised smile. ""You're not what I expected, Oz.""  
  
  ""What'd you expect?""  
  
  She shrugs, blushing. ""I don't know. You've got the tattoos and long hair and the motorcycle. I thought you'd be...I don't know. You're nice. I misjudged you, so...sorry.""  
  
  We're outside and standing beside my Indian. I touch her chin with the knuckle of my index finger. ""I may have manners, sweetness, but I'm not nice.""  
  
  ""No?""  
  
  I shake my head. ""Nope. You'll see."" I swing on, shift forward to give her room.  
  
  Oh, man. The way my zipper tightens as she slides on behind me and wraps her arms around me and crushes her chest to my back, holding on a little too tightly...bad. Not good. Warning signs. She's a good girl with a future. I'm a bad boy with none. Too bad I'm an idiot who never pays attention to warning signs.  
  
  She directs me with pointed gestures, and soon we enter a gated community outside Nashville. Huge, huge houses. Brick, lots of glass. Wide driveways and three-car garages. Lincolns, Beemers, Mercedes, a few pickups, Rovers, and Hummers. Manicured lawns, everything in place. I'm intimidated. Two-room apartments are all I've ever known. How do you live in places like this? What would that be like? Do you ever get used to such wealth? What's it like to live in one city your entire life? I can't fathom it.  
  
  She points at a house on the left side of the street. It's not the biggest on the block, but it's nice. Beautiful. A wide porch in front, a huge deck in back. An open garage door reveals a huge pickup truck with oversize tires, a small, sleek, black BMW, and a classic Triumph motorcycle. The motorcycle was being worked on, judging by the array of tools around it and the grease rag on the seat.  
  
  It was being worked on by the holy-shit-he's-huge man standing in the driveway, thick, tattooed arms folded over a hard, muscular chest. I'd heard him sing, even seen YouTube videos of him and Nell performing together, but the man in person is scary as fuck. I don't scare easily, but this guy could do it, if anyone could. I swallow my nerves, call on my reserves of cool. I pull into her driveway, let the bike roll to a stop beside Kylie's dad, kill the engine. I put the stand down and swing off. He's glaring at me. At my leather jacket, the spiked helmet, my long hair. Staring me down. I'd be lying if I said I'm not a little nervous. Not scared, just...nervous. Yeah.  
  
  Kylie hops off, hangs the helmet on the back of the bike, and slams into her father for a hug. He does it one-arm, the other hand stuffed into his pocket. ""Daddy!"" She leans up and kisses his cheek. ""You're back!""  
  
  He nods. ""Yeah, got in this afternoon."" He doesn't take his eyes off me while he speaks. ""Who's this?""  
  
  I step toward him. ""Oz Hyde, sir.""  
  
  ""Colt."" His grip is crushing, but not with intent, simply because his hands are just that strong. ""Oz, huh? What kind of name is Oz?""  
  
  ""Mine."" I meet his gaze levelly. I see where Kylie got her sapphire eyes.  
  
  There's something in his expression. Suspicion? Awareness? I'm not sure. He glances at his daughter. ""Ben said you'd gone off with some guy.""  
  
  ""'Ben said'?"" She says it with a bit of anger. ""God, really? Ben is my friend, Daddy, not my boyfriend, not my parent. I don't have to stay with him just because he says.""  
  
  He has nothing to say to this. He looks back at me. ""New in town, Oz?""  
  
   
I nod. ""Yes, sir."" I can't help but be respectful to Colt. He's dangerous. I can sense it in him. The fighter in me, the survivor in me, recognizes the hardness in him. He's seen some shit, and he may live a cush life now, but he hasn't always. Fists remember.  
  
  ""Where'd you move from?""  
  
  ""Atlanta.""  
  
  He glances at my bike, nodding appreciatively. ""Nice bike.""  
  
  I grin, and nod at his Triumph. ""Thanks. I like yours. What year is it?""  
  
  ""Forty-eight.""  
  
  ""Damn. Sure is sweet.""  
  
  ""Yeah."" He blinks at me, assessing, thinking. ""Look. My daughter is old enough to choose her own...friends. But listen to me, boy. You take my daughter on a ride, you ride careful. Got it? You hurt her, you deal with me.""  
  
  Kylie blushed, embarrassed, and moved between me and Colt. ""Jeez, Dad. Are you gonna get out your shotgun next?""  
  
  He doesn't even twitch. ""Who needs a shotgun?""  
  
  Not him, that's for damn sure.  
  
  I meet his gaze steadily. ""I got you, sir. She'll be safe.""  
  
  I see him glance over my shoulder, and I turn to see Kylie's friend Ben approaching with another man who has to be his dad. I recognize his dad, too, but I can't place him. He's a short, muscular man, and he looks like he's in sick shape, especially considering he has a teenaged son. I didn't leave things with Ben on a great note, and I have no desire to rehash the territorial aggression with him, not in front of his dad, and Kylie, and Colt. Talk about outnumbered. Shit. Time for my getaway.  
  
  But before I can mount up, they're behind me. Ben's eying me with open hostility, and his dad sees this, glancing from him to me to Kylie. He reaches out and shakes Colt's hand, pulling him in for a man-hug. ""Colt! Good to see you. Been back long?""  
  
  ""Jay. Good to see you, too. No, a few hours.""  
  
  Suddenly I know who this is: Jason Dorsey, wide receiver for the Tennessee Titans. He played for the Saints for several years at the start of his career, and he was with them for all three of their back-to-back Super Bowl wins. He was a huge part of the reason they were so good, honestly. The QB was nothing astounding, but he could hit Dorsey from anywhere in the field, and once Dorsey had the ball it was a guaranteed TD. He was acquired by the Titans twelve years ago as a free agent, and he's been here ever since, racking up numbers that'll likely get him into the Hall of Fame.  
  
  And Ben's his son.  
  
  I swallow my nerves. ""Mr. Dorsey."" I shake his hand. I force myself to be casual, neutral, and pleasant to his son. ""Ben.""  
  
  ""Call me Jason."" He eyes his son again but says nothing. At least not in front of me.  
  
  Ben shakes my hand, but the hostility in his eyes could drill holes into my skull. ""Oz."" He fairly growls it through it gritted teeth.  
  
  I've got to get out of here. Colt is just standing there, a threat merely by his presence. Jason Dorsey is trying to figure out the source of the tension between me and Ben, and Kylie clearly just wants to go inside. I give her a grin. ""I'll see you later, Calloway."" I give an awkward wave, a nod. ""Colt, Jason. Nice to meet you."" I don't bother with saying goodbye to Ben.  
  
  He and I are going to tangle at some point, and it's going to be a rough one.  
  
  Kylie waves at me as I swing onto my bike, letting it roll down the driveway. I wave back and then gun the engine, twist the throttle so my Indian kicks forward. As soon as I'm out of the sub and on the freeway heading home, I open the throttle and let her purr. All the way home I'm thinking of a tall girl with strawberry blonde hair and big round tits and a smile I could kill for.  
  
  Fuck. Maybe I'll be the one to suggest we move this time.

1nir94q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nir94q/are_cuzn_uc200_under_sink_water_filters_truly/,Are CuZn UC-200 Under Sink Water Filters Truly Efficient? In-Depth Review Here!,"The CuZn UC-200 Under-Sink Water Filter has taken center stage in my household for the past few weeks. As someone who spends an inordinate amount of time fussing over water quality (it’s what happens when you’ve lived through questionable tap water incidents), this filtration system has been a surprising mix of simplicity and elegance. While I was drawn in by its promise of a 5-year filtration life, there’s more to this product that demands a deeper dive.

**Design and Installation**

I admit, I don’t exactly have a knack for DIY projects, but installing this under-sink water filter was refreshingly stress-free. The product comes with clear instructions, all the required fixtures, and a video tutorial link, which was my safety net throughout the process. No holes needed to be drilled – always a plus for renters. Its sleek black cylindrical design allowed it to blend seamlessly into the cramped under-sink cabinet that houses a chaotic mix of cleaning supplies and long-forgotten Tupperware lids.

**Highlighted Positives**

- The 5-year filter life is a standout feature, significantly reducing the long-term hassle of replacements.
- Includes a 3-stage filtration system combining Micro Sediment Membranes, KDF-55, and Coconut Shell Carbon for maximum effectiveness.
- Retains beneficial minerals, so your water tastes great without the clinical “distilled” vibe.
- Certified materials (NSF/ANSI 42) ensure reduced impurities, including PFAs, Chlorine, Lead, and PFOA/PFOS.
- Designed with rental-friendly, no-drill installation.

**Performance at Its Peak**

Living in an area where tap water often smells like a cross between pool chlorine and ancient pipes, the difference this filter made was instantaneous. The first sip of water after installing it was, dare I say, revelatory. The crisp, clean taste was reminiscent of bottled water, minus the plastic guilt. Additionally, my tea and coffee tasted richer and more nuanced – a detail that impressed my overly-caffeinated sister.

**Downsides Noticed**

- This filter system, while excellent at reducing various contaminants, does not address TDS (Total Dissolved Solids), which might be a dealbreaker for those seeking TDS-free water.
- It’s on the heavier side – the 7.26-pound weight surprised me during installation, though this isn’t a daily concern.
- As someone who loves tech-assisted gadgets, I did pine a little for any sort of connectivity feature or app integration.

**Material Durability and Everyday Usage**

After years of using filters that seemed flimsy on bad days and downright annoying on good ones, I appreciated the robust design of this beauty. The CuZn UC-200 feels rugged yet compact, boasting heavy-duty materials that align with the company’s reputation for quality products. I didn’t spot any “cheap plastic” vibes here – if anything, the sturdy components inspire trust in its longevity. Its promised 5-year lifespan already feels like an oasis compared to the six-month filter cycles I was accustomed to with my old water purifiers.

**Product Rivals**

When it comes to under-sink filtration systems, the CuZn UC-200 competes with big, familiar names like the iSpring RCC7 and the APEC WFS-1000. Both alternatives have their merits. The iSpring RCC7 offers reverse osmosis, which reduces TDS, making it ideal for those obsessed with ultra-pure water. On the flip side, maintaining the reverse osmosis systems can be trickier and costlier. 

The APEC WFS-1000, though effective, doesn’t quite match the UC-200 in its filtration lifespan. CuZn’s ability to leave beneficial minerals intact really set it apart in everyday usage. If your goal isn’t TDS eradication but great-tasting tap water and contaminant reduction, this product might just punch above its weight compared to its peers.

**Cost Efficiency**

Does the investment feel justified? For me, it absolutely does – and not just due to its primary offering of crisp, safe drinking water. It’s the extended filter life combined with the durability of its components that ensures you get mileage for your money. Spread across five years, I’m already envisioning the notable savings compared to biannual filter replacements from other brands. Here's where this unit emerges as a practical, economical choice.

1nir8x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/upstate_new_york/comments/1nir8x4/hudson_valley_living_reccos/,Hudson Valley Living Reccos,"Hey everyone!

I’m 31, originally from western NY but I left after college and have been living in LA and Austin for the last few years. After a lot of 90–100° days, I’m craving seasons again and that unique upstate NY vibe I grew up with but a bit more city centric (I’m from Buffalo and have lived in Rochester too)

I’m thinking about moving to the Hudson Valley/Catskills area places like Kingston, Beacon, Rhinebeck, or nearby towns look beautiful! I’d love to hear suggestions for areas that:

	•	Have some community/culture (young-ish crowd would be a bonus I’m 31 for reference!)
	•	Are within a reasonable commute to restaurants, coffee shops, etc. (I’m not looking for total isolation)
	•	Offer rentals around ~$1,500/month (1BR or small house)
	•	Good access to nature — I love community events, small lakes, farmers markets, all that

Basically, I’m looking for a town where I can live within my means but still enjoy the charm and pace of upstate life.

If you’re local or have made a similar move, where would you recommend I look? Are there any up-and-coming spots I should check out (or avoid)?

Thanks in advance!

1nir8v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1nir8v5/10day_portugal_itinerary_help/,10Day Portugal Itinerary Help,"Hi! My husband and I (late 20’s early 30’s) are planning a 10-day trip to Portugal for October (this next month) with his parents (in their 60s and 70s – active, curious, and outdoorsy - but very easy and happy and appreciate life’s simple pleasures)

We’ve put together a day-by-day itinerary and would love feedback from people who’ve traveled in Portugal before, especially in the fall. We’re 100% open to changing the plan if something feels off, is logistically tricky, too touristy, or not worth it for the time of year. We don’t need to see everything, just want to feel like we saw everything that was worthwhile in 10 days.

What we’re looking for
- Scenic, design-forward experiences that don’t feel overly touristy 
- Charming neighborhoods, tiled streets, golden sunsets 
- Good food, natural beauty, interesting architecture (Dietary note: I’m pescatarian (fish, eggs, dairy, vegetables) while my husband and in-laws eat fish, meat and chicken but no pork or shellfish.)
- Local cafés, gardens, wine bars, low-pressure activities 
- Some outdoor time (hikes/beautiful scenery)
- Space to slow down and enjoy the setting 
- Avoid long lines, box-checking and unnecessary big crowds

We’re currently planning to rent a car for the middle of the trip (Lisbon to Lagos to Douro) and fly from Faro to Porto. But we’re open to changing that if train or car the whole way is better.

    •    Dinner: Mistu (editorial vibe) or Puro 4050 (if not already visited).

More questions
    •    Is pacing right, or should time be shifted between Lisbon, Algarve, and Porto? Are we spending too much or too little time in any place? 
    •    Should a car be rented the entire trip or only for specific legs (Lisbon–Algarve, Douro Valley)?
    •    Is Algarve (Lagos/Faro) worth the October detour, or better to swap for another region? If so, which one?
    •    Would you cut or replace any destination in this plan? 
    •    Are there smaller towns or scenic spots (e.g., Comporta, Alcácer do Sal, Évora, Coimbra) that deserve a stopover? Or that would be a better use of time in October? 
    •    Would you skip Sintra given potential crowds and other countryside plans?
    •    Would a guided food or walking tour (Lisbon or Porto) add valuable cultural depth?

1nir8i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nir8i7/aio_for_ending_friendship_with_my_ex_housemate/,AIO for ending friendship with my ex housemate,"So I met my friend Linda (Fake name) at work. we were both in our early twenties straight out of college starting a new job. We’d hang out, go out for food and drink and the usual. Her housemate was moving aboard and she suggested I move in with her since I was already looking to move houses. I used to live too far and ended up moving in with her as she was closer to work. I lived with her for 1 year (got married after to my then bf) most of which was fantastic until towards the end I started noticing things. 

Now the house was extremely dirty I knew it because i had been to her place a few times and I did made her aware that I like to keep my place decently clean. Now I didn’t expect her to change and I did most of the cleaning mopping also there was just a lot of stuff in the house, seemed like she was a hoarder. I cleaned everything removed the mold from the walls and the works. Now I didn’t mind doing all of this and I really value friendship so I use to make breakfast or coffee for her too whenever I made mine. And cook extra portions for her too whenever I made something nice. I shared with her my career/education plan (not gatekeeping anything even tho we were in the same department at work), my deepest worries, things about my family, my insecurities.

Then I started noticing none of the things I was doing was being reciprocated in any way so I stopped making her breakfast/food. and then she started taunting me like “oh I like those pancakes you make a lot you don’t you make them anymore “ I used to bake and ofc share it with her, I spent hours to bake her favourite cake for her birthday, did her makeup and hair for the party even after nothing being reciprocated. Then she’d say “oh I like walnut cake a lot” or I like this/that a lot thinking I’ll make it for her. I didn’t. then commenting on my looks started. I like myself and all the flaws of my body. but some remarks hurt she knew I was insecure about my dark circles, “oh you look like a panda with those dark circles”, I’d say it’s rude but she’s do it again and say it’s a joke. She herself is far from perfect but I never made a comment on her body or looks. Previously I encouraged her to date people but she never does (i think she’s very conscious about how she looks) then one day at another friends party i got to know (in front of her)that she had been on dates and lied to me. It’d have been fine if she didn’t tell me anything rather than lying about it. so i stopped taking about that subject with her completely thinking she’s not comfortable.

Then never taking out trash started ( I did it all the time for at least 2 months) If we run out of toilet paper or other essential I’ll refill without asking but she will keep telling me oh we need to buy this but will never buy it herself. 

I told myself it’s only a matter of time and I’ll live with my bf so I went through everything without saying anything. 

Cut to present: I got married and she got a double promotion in a matter of months. Now that we didn’t live together i thought we could be better friends. I still shared a lot with her and we met up plenty. still it was my manager who told me she was on her notice period before she did. It hurt sharing my whole life with her only to be treated like a stranger. she was never a competition to me and I knew she deserved all the success. 

But i noticed she gave me a lot of backhanded comments when we met up at work. the last straw was when she laughed at my outfit- I was wearing a jumper and jeans (the most normal outfit ever. I told her it’s rude but she kept laughing and insulting me 4 more times before saying “it’s a joke” and that she was only taking revenge because I didn’t attend her birthday party this year (I had covid).

I have decided I will no longer be friends either her.

**[this is a collection of emails from the London Medical Institute in chronological order]**

**From D. Wakefield [6/8/36]**

Alright, this is amazing and horrifying but here’s what I’ve gotten so far. Assuming the blood tests came through the same on your end:

1) there have been major edits to the Venlil, Krakotl and Gojid in particular 

2) the latter 2 of them could eat meat but are now allergic which is impossible 

3) clear genetic edits within the Venlil more than other species (more tests needed)

4) this may be part of a larger scheme

please inform us of any breakthroughs 

Additionally, I have found a krakotl that can eat meat, here’s her file: [link blocked by request of family]


**From: Dr. A. Stern [8/8/36]**

Insane breakthrough on the Venlil front! We got multiple brain scans and dissections. So far: 

The legs appear to have been shifted to be worse at long distance running

Larger amygdalae appear to cause a near constant state of fear in Venlil 

Head shape appears to be built for charges and headbutting similar to goats

Will get back with more!


**Dr. U. Thule [10/8/36]**

We have begun the first trials in synthesising a possible reversal, this will take at least 4 months for the krakotl but if we get whatever sequence they’re using set in stone itll be much faster. In addition, the genome seems to not appear in federation sequencers so we’ll have to home grow a new program 

most of my team is working overtime now so we better be getting some free coffee.


**Acklam - krakotl blood donor [11/8/36]

Sitting in this sterile, white room felt claustrophobic, even more so with the mere concept of having a ~~predator~~ human take my blood but then again… helping my species made me feel so exited and happy. 

The prick of the needle didn’t hurt

It wouldn’t

It couldn’t 

I was trained to endure pain for the herd… 

Is this for the herd? I think yes

I had to be strong to help my people

I left the clinic soon after and, finally, decided to get some meat. My card specified that I can eat meat (though monthly checkups were required).

I made my way to a small van parked in the middle of a busy square, one of many as I’ve been told, it was selling a myriad of different meats.

“Sorry, uhh…” the man trailed off trying to remember my species. “But you can’t eat anything from here it’s all meat.” 

I had learnt enough English to get around and, though I wasn’t skilled, managed to start a conversation 

“Card.” I brought up my card and he read it. 

“Really, you can eat meat?” He asked

I nodded, which was apparently the closed humans had to what we could do with our wings

A small crowd had gathered including some clinic workers and other people.

I pointed to a burger I wanted and he got to making it

A shorter than average man came over to me
“Trial by fire?” He spoke

“I have had it before” I replied rather disjointedly but he seemed to understand 

“Well, good luck” he stated

I finally got my burger, paid and sat down. The now sizeable crowd murmurings halting in anticipation for me to eat

I held it up

I sank my teeth in

Eyes went shut

I quiet prayer was answered and I lived 

It was a new favour I hadn’t ever experienced 

I was a heretic yet I had found a gift from the gods

“It’s good” I spoke, a reply of sighs filled the streets

If I could describe it, it would be salty in the best way possible… but that didn’t give the food justice, I need time and maybe a few different dishes to properly articulate it

[time skip: 2 hours later]

I had been given a ‘flat’ as the English called it, it was small but also all I needed. TV, desk for my laptop, fridge, a rather small shower but still usable and such. 

I did want to try human clothes but today? I decided to relax

I would play a human game.

A gambit made by them was complete transparency, good and bad, and I was at the forefront of it. 

And now I was stuck with a myriad of choices on what to play…

The eternal archive was open, all that was left was for me to find a good tale

Thanks for reading :]

I currently have 7 games on my mind: Xcom2, bloodborne, armoured core, bloodborne, risk of rain 2, Minecraft or factorio

The whole day just kinda followed that vibe. Got a halfway decent coffee, work was quiet, and now I'm just hanging out. No grand plans, just chillin'.

My husband and I (late 20’s early 30’s) are planning a 10-day trip to Portugal for October (this next month) with his parents (in their 60s and 70s – active, curious, and outdoorsy - but very easy and happy and appreciate life’s simple pleasures)

We’ve put together a day-by-day itinerary and would love feedback from people who’ve traveled in Portugal before, especially in the fall. We’re 100% open to changing the plan if something feels off, is logistically tricky, too touristy, or not worth it for the time of year. We don’t need to see everything, just want to feel like we saw everything that was worthwhile in 10 days.

What we’re looking for
- Scenic, design-forward experiences that don’t feel overly touristy 
- Charming neighborhoods, tiled streets, golden sunsets 
- Good food, natural beauty, interesting architecture (Dietary note: I’m pescatarian (fish, eggs, dairy, vegetables) while my husband and in-laws eat fish, meat and chicken but no pork or shellfish.)
- Local cafés, gardens, wine bars, low-pressure activities 
- Some outdoor time (hikes/beautiful scenery)
- Space to slow down and enjoy the setting 
- Avoid long lines, box-checking and unnecessary big crowds

We’re currently planning to rent a car for the middle of the trip (Lisbon to Lagos to Douro) and fly from Faro to Porto. But we’re open to changing that if train or car the whole way is better.

    •    Cross Dom Luís I Bridge (top level) for a golden-hour skyline.
    •    Drinks: Graham’s 1890 Lodge rooftop, grassy Jardim do Morro, or select spots inside the WOW complex (Angel’s Share, Mira Mira).
    •    Dinner: Cantinho do Avillez, ODE Porto Wine House, or A Despensa.

Day 8 – Porto Local Neighborhoods & Riverside

    •    Dinner: Elemental (natural wine, wood-fired) or Adega São Nicolau (classic tavern).
Questions & notes
– Should we replace a morning with a food tour (e.g., Porto Walkers) for deeper cultural context?

Day 9 – Douro Valley Day Trip
    •    Choice of small-group tour or DIY drive.
    •    Vineyards like Quinta do Tedo, Pacheca, or Quinta da Foz.

Questions & notes
– Is an overnight in the Douro Valley worth it in October, or is a long day trip just as good?
– Any alternative experiences that might beat the standard vineyard circuit?

Day 10 – Porto Easy Finale
    •    Easy coffee at Early Cedofeita, C’alma Specialty Coffee, or Nicolau.
    •    Optional last-minute design shopping: Mercado 48 or Coração Alecrim.
    •    Leisurely Ribeira or Passeio das Virtudes for one last Douro view.
    •    Lunch: O Diplomata (crepes), Zenith or Heim (brunch).
    •    Sunset: Passeio das Virtudes lawn or Gota a Gota wine bar.
    •    Dinner: Mistu (editorial vibe) or Puro 4050 (if not already visited).

More questions
    •    Is pacing right, or should time be shifted between Lisbon, Algarve, and Porto? Are we spending too much or too little time in any place? 
    •    Should a car be rented the entire trip or only for specific legs (Lisbon–Algarve, Douro Valley)?
    •    Is Algarve (Lagos/Faro) worth the October detour, or better to swap for another region? If so, which one?
    •    Would you cut or replace any destination in this plan? 
    •    Are there smaller towns or scenic spots (e.g., Comporta, Alcácer do Sal, Évora, Coimbra) that deserve a stopover? Or that would be a better use of time in October? 
    •    Would you skip Sintra given potential crowds and other countryside plans?
    •    Would a guided food or walking tour (Lisbon or Porto) add valuable cultural depth?

This post shows where staff use them.

# Where it fits (micro-workflows)

* **Nursing Stations:** keyboards, mice, desk phones/handsets, workstation carts, badge fronts/backs. *30-60s routine at shift start/end; coverage over keys and seams.*
* **Patient Intake & Discharge:** clipboards/pens, card readers, barcode scanners, wheelchair push handles. *Between-patient quick wipe → UV-C pass while resetting the bay.*
* **Break Rooms:** fridge handles, microwave keypads, coffee station levers, door pulls. *“Clean then zap” during daily tidy.*

# Test / Data (summary)

* **Independent lab testing (hard, non-porous surfaces):** • *Staphylococcus aureus:* **99.9%** reduction in **\~15s** • *Escherichia coli:* **99.99%** in **\~24s** • *SARS-CoV-2:* **99.9%** in **\~32s** *Conditions: fixed distance, smooth surfaces; time/dose guided by device. Real-world results vary.*
* **What UV-C is / isn’t:** a **complement** to routine cleaning, best after visible soil is removed. Not for skin, eyes, or instrument sterilization; follow facility IP protocols.

# Safety & policy notes

Eye/skin protection by design (aim-sensing/auto-off), avoid use on people, pets, or liquids; stick to **hard, non-porous** items. Adhere to hospital policies and IP guidance.

# Open Q thread for healthcare pros (ask me anything)

* Where would UV-C best fit (or not) in your unit’s workflow?
* Have you validated surface hygiene (e.g., ATP) before/after routines, what did you see?
* Which touchpoints are hardest to keep clean between wipes/turnover?
* Any policy or safety concerns from IP/biomed we should address?
* If you’ve trialed UV-C, what guidance worked for staff training?

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The **Seattle Mariners** (82-68) enter as -110 favorites, with a 60-45 record in games they’re favored. Their offense is a nuclear reactor: **4.7 runs per game**, **216 home runs**, and **Cal Raleigh** (54 HRs, 115 RBI) ready to swing for the fences. Their starter, **Logan Gilbert**, has a 3.54 ERA and 159 strikeouts—enough to make a math teacher weep with joy over those Ks.

The **Kansas City Royals** (75-75) are +115 underdogs, with a 45.3% win rate when they’re the underdog. Their pitching staff boasts a **3.73 ERA** (4th in MLB), but their starter, **Michael Wacha**, is a mixed bag: 3.45 ERA, but just **6.6 K/9**—like a slow internet connection that buffers every time you try to stream a game. The Royals’ offense? A modest **3.8 runs per game** and **144 HRs** (25th in MLB).

**Key Stat Takeaway**: The Mariners’ slugging percentage (.416, 11th) edges out the Royals’ (.391, 19th), but Wacha’s lack of strikeouts could let Seattle’s bats go nuclear.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Rumors, and Why Wacha’s ERA Is a Mirage

No major injuries to report, but here’s what’s cooking:

* **Michael Wacha** has been a glass-half-full pitcher: 3.45 ERA sounds solid, but his **6.6 K/9** is so low, it’s like he’s pitching to a room full of retirees who’ve already had their coffee.
* **Bobby Witt Jr.** (.292 BA) is Kansas City’s offensive spark, but the Mariners’ defense (1.239 WHIP, 8th in MLB) is a hungry alligator—sharp, fast, and ready to swallow errors whole.
* **Julio Rodriguez** (.478 SLG) is a slugger with a slugging percentage that makes a sledgehammer blush. He’s the kind of hitt

1nir401,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FunGarage2225/comments/1nir401/how_to_make_900_in_a_day/,How to Make $900 in a Day,"Here’s exactly how I did it, and you can literally steal this if you want.



Step 0: Where the idea came from. I wasn’t about to make any digital product. I went into Facebook groups, Reddit subs, and even other course communities I’m in. I paid attention to what people were complaining about not what gurus said they “should” want.



The pattern? People wanted to make money online without: 1. Creating their own product (too hard, takes too long) 2. Selling high ticket stuff that requires begging strangers for $500+ 3. Getting peanuts for commission rates (40%–60%). I made mine where they get 100% profit 😏



So I made something stupid simple, valuable, and easy to resell. A done for you $13.33 ebook bundle that they can resell for 100% profit. No revenue share. No waiting for payouts. You sell it, you keep it.



Step 1: Build something valuable but simple. My bundle wasn’t a random ebook. It came with: • A 70+ page ebook (What to Post When You Need Sales by Friday) • Video training version of the ebook • Lazy Money Launch Notes (my exact behind the scenes framework) • A workbook so they can follow along • Access to my private community where I go live daily with strategies



I made it so good people would feel dumb saying no.



Step 2: Price it like a no brainer. $13.33 is I won’t even think about it pricing. People spend more than that daily without blinking. coffee, DoorDash tips, random Amazon crap.



Step 3: Post like you mean it. I followed my own framework. I didn’t wait for the algorithm to be in the mood. I made enough noise that ignoring me wasn’t an option.



Step 4: Sell where buyers are (not just where my followers hang out). I hit niche communities and psychographic matches. people who fit the lifestyle my product speaks to. Plus, I used promotional FB groups that allow selling.



Step 5: Urgency. I made it clear that my price wasn’t going to stay that low forever, and I meant it. Scarcity works when you’re not bluffing.



Mistakes along the way (so you don’t repeat them) • I originally priced it too high because I thought low ticket = low value (wrong) • I wasted a full week posting in dead groups before I filtered for ones with real engagement. • I overexplained in some posts. people don’t need a TED Talk to buy a $13 product.



Steal this if you want If you want to take this same model. same done for you bundle, same resell rights, same 100% profit structure I already made the product for you. Your only job would be to sell it.



And if you’d rather make your own? Cool. Just reverse engineer what I laid out above and go get your own $900+ day.

His world irreversibly changes when he meets somebody unexpected, deep in the closet, that traps him, making the transition to adulthood from early success who wonders where he's going too.""

I should say that it doesn't shy away from gay sex, though I wouldn't call it erotica.

Here is a excerpt from the first chapter (I'm not sure how much I'm supposed to do):

""When I was seventeen, getting out of school for summer was a rite of passage, especially since I was going to be a senior the next fall, class of 1977. The ritual involved me singing.

  “Where is it? Ah, there you are, my trusty Alice Cooper tape.”

  I popped it in, and started to sing with my speakers turned to full nuke for everybody to hear.

  “School’s out for summer! School’s out for summer! Summer! Schoooooool’s out forevvvvver…” singing at the top of my lungs.

  Not that anybody was going to hear me. I could be Alice Cooper himself and nobody would hear my greatness. Fuck me. There weren’t more than one or two people within a mile of the Moore Public School that would hear me in bustling downtown Moore, Montana, though. Bustling. Yeah, right. I couldn't wait to get out of this hellhole of a wide spot in the highway, and being a senior meant that it was just one short year that I had to spend in this purgatory, and I’d finally be sprung free. 

  Could you blame me? You should see the place. Moore was pretty much nothing at all. There were a few streets with a couple dozen houses that were sad and rundown. Most of them could use a new coat of paint. We had a painting at home with cute, colorful houses in some Norwegian fjord. I guess our ancestors forgot how to use paint on their way here from the old country. 

  There was also a coffee shop called “Moore Coffee?” that I worked at, which served as a focal point of the community. Old farmers and ranchers used it to bitch about anything that wasn’t some 50’s Leave It to Beaver paradise of family, life, and all of the rest of that fucked-up bullshit. They all cheered Archie Bunker, who they thought was Nixon’s Silent Majority in the flesh. Too much flesh, and not particularly silent from what I could tell.

  There was an Ag supply store that seemed to do ok business, which was no surprise. Beside my school there was a little library too that served as the town center next to our school. But the place was dusty and windy, and the sidewalks could use a good cleaning. So could the residents. Probably why the folks in Lewistown called us Moorelocks, like the Time Machine's monsters. I mean, I always washed behind my ears, but I got tarred as a Moorelock anyway. But I was out of school for summer at least. It gave me even more time to… well, it gave me more time.

  At least it was better than home, which was out in the middle of nowhere where Dad's cattle ranch was, so technically I wasn’t even a Moorelock. I’m not even going to tell you the ranch’s name because it’s too damn embarrassing – what on earth were my great-grandparents thinking 80 years ago when they named it? I was convinced it was named just to embarrass me at school. Cattle brands and the letter J? Were they really that clueless?

Add to that the constant, depressing rain this year, and you can imagine, I barely had a moment to breathe, even on weekends. So when I suddenly lost access to the cloud platform I’d been working on, I let out an audible sigh of relief. No more work for the weekend!

Without wasting a second, I shot a message to my riding buddies. A weekend ride was happening, and the plan was simple: *somewhere* out of Kolkata. Within a day, planning, bookings, everything was set.

The plan? Start early in the morning, leave Kolkata before the city even wakes up, grab breakfast in Medinipur where another rider would join us, then cruise down to Mukutmonipur by lunchtime. After that, it was all about chilling at the dam.

Saturday morning, four of us gathered at the tea stall near Dhulagarh toll plaza around 5:15 AM. In our group, we had two Triumph 400X, one CB350, and my trusty NX500. We spotted a massive group of riders, members of the *Riders Community of Bengal* on Facebook. We let them take the lead, figuring it was better not to get stuck in a sea of bikes. Meanwhile, we connected our intercoms and had a hot cup of coffee to kick things of

By 6:00 AM, we were on the road to Medinipur. The ride was smooth, and we pulled into SalPiyal Restaurant for a breakfast stop by 7:30. Another rider joined us here, also on an NX500, and we were ready to fuel up for the next leg of the journey.

After filling our stomachs and the bikes, we hit the road by 8:30. Our first official stop? Bardi Pahar Eco Resort in Bankura. A quick dip in the river behind the resort, a few laughs, and we were back on the road toward Mukutmonipur. By 1:30 PM, we rolled into the Peerless Resort, our stop for the night.

After checking in, we headed straight for the dam. Fun fact: Mukutmonipur boasts one of the largest earthen dams in India. We had a 30 minute boating session on the water, followed by a ride across the dam itself. Naturally, we paused for a mobile photography session

By 8:30 PM, we were back at the resort, swapping stories and enjoying some good ‘adda’. The night ended with a well-earned rest, and we were out by 11:00 PM.

Sunday morning, we checked out by 10:00 AM, ready for the return leg. First stop: Sutan Forest. After that, we looped back through Belpahari and Gidhni, avoiding the traffic chaos of Jhargram city by taking the Chichra route to the NH-49. The last 20 km before the highway was an absolute disaster, bumpy and nearly non-existent, but once we hit the NH, it was smooth sailing

We cruised from Chichra at 2:45 PM, and by 4:45 PM, we were breezing through Kolaghat. After a longish tea break, we finally reached home by 7:30 PM.

Mission accomplished. The weekend ride turned out to be the perfect escape.

Oh, and I had a chance to test out some new gear on this trip. I recently bought the RS Taichi Drymaster Kompass jacket and pants, and this was my first ride in them. The gear is super light, but by design, it lets in very little air. I was sweating buckets the entire way, definitely something to get used to.

As for the motorcycle, no big complaints, except for the rear suspension (I *really* dislike it). Total distance covered was around 600km and mileage on the console was about 31kpl.

I met this girl 8 months ago. We were assigned to the same group for a project. Random of course.

From the go I could tell there was something between us. We spent the entire semester growing super close.

Even to the other team mates it was clear there was chemistry. So I eventually made a move respectfully asked her out for coffee.

She claimed she was seeing someone, so I respected it and stepped away. 

After that I detached just focused on the project. There were things that led me to believe she had lied about the boyfriend but it was a boundary and I wasn't the type to push.

So what followed was a clear spiral. She stopped contributing to the project after that, completely shut down. There was more to this but I won't type it all out because I don't need this post to become too long.

So summer I went back home spent it with my family etc. I kept getting added by fake accounts and I have reason to believe it was her. Again won't post the why but yeah

So I return to campus and despite being in different programs I'm sharing a class with her again. 

First time she saw me she bolted for the door. Second time she got her friends involved by sitting close and they kept looking back at me, which means they likley knew our history.

There is still a lot of tension between us and I sent her a text trying to clear the air but she took it as a he doesn't care anymore. She showed up last class sat down then abruptly left for no reason.

Everything I do when it comes to her makes things worse. I've dated before but never faced anything this complicated where I keep having to be vulnerable and she keeps hiding. It's literally impacting both of us clearly and I don't know how to fix it. I don't  expect us to end up together but I'd do anything for things to just be normal so we can focus on our academics.

1niqxib,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1niqxib/partner_pursuing_guy_who_just_rejected_me/,Partner pursuing guy who just rejected me,"Sorry in advance this is sooo long, typing it all out was kind of cathartic though as it’s all extremely fresh. 

Tl;dr I was seeing & then rejected by a friend who closed his relationship, my partner got a crush on said friend and pursued him immediately after my getting turned down, obviously got rejected too, now both of us are hurt and I’m unsure how to proceed. 


I have a messy situation that I (29M, 7ish years poly experience) and my partner (32NB, first poly relationship & first relationship in general) are sorting out. We have been together a little over 3 years at this point and have played together and separately, and I have had some casual relationships and play partners, but they are very shy and have not pursued anyone else beyond some casual fun, other than this. 

This situation started a few months ago when a friend of mine (22M) who moved to another city last year expressed romantic interest in me after we hooked up on a trip with some mutual friends we were both on. I felt some trepidation over the age difference but I liked him and agreed it could be fun to feel things out and take it slow. 

Well oops, turns out he had discussed hooking up with others with his partner (21M) but not dating others before this, and within a month his partner expressed he was actually not ok with this and they both closed their relationship. Ouch, but I kinda figured that kind of messiness can come with the territory of considering younger, less life experienced partners, so while I needed a bit of time to lick my wounds, we are still friends now, but with more boundaries. His partner and I are also on good terms, thankfully. 

Anyway, (bear with me this situation is kinda complicated to explain), before this trip my partner visited the city these friends live in, and since I had introduced them all at a party a couple months prior, ended up hanging out with them.. and staying with them for 3 weeks (which ngl I felt pretty hurt by as I only got a few days notice, and expressed this to them). They developed a pretty strong crush on the guy who I started seeing (they did not tell me they’d had a crush til after I had hooked up with this guy, and gave their blessing to me seeing him romantically despite not actually being ok with it, which I am also sad about as I would not have wanted to do something that hurt them if I had known). 

A weird moment I’m kind of feeling complicated about is my partner had been invited on this trip for months and was never interested in joining me, but a couple days before it/during it they started freaking out and looking at last minute tickets. I found out later its because they wanted to keep hanging out with their crush, and didn’t really want to stay at my accommodations or anything. At one point while on the phone with them they expressed sadness they wouldn’t see their crush for another few days, and in the same conversation when I said I was excited to see them again, they just said I should get used to seeing them less. Which hurt a lot, and they apologized, but it had contributed to me feeling a bit of weirdness/jealousy over their crush I wasn’t sure how to sort out. 

Anyway, after all of this, and after the guy had ended things with me, my partner starts pursuing him very hard. They text him all day, give him a ton of gifts, talk about him all the time, including gushing over how cute he is and how fun it was hooking up with him (it happened during the time I was also seeing the guy and before he closed his relationship). I honestly don’t really like hearing this much about metas, and especially not within a week of being rejected by the person being described, so I asked them to tone it down and not tell me these things as it stung for me to hear those things. I also felt a bit weird about their age gap to be honest, but didn’t feel like that conversation would go over well. 

Knowing the crush rejected me to be in a closed relationship, I did one day ask my partner how their crush was going and they said the crush knew about their feelings and they were on the same page. Which hurt a bit ngl, but ultimately knowing my partner has so rarely pursued crushes I felt obligated to be ok with it. I just asked they not gush about him to me, at least while I got over my own hurt feelings. 

I was going to be in the city these friends lived in for work, and they invited me to stay with them for a while and visit. My partner decided to join last minute, and while I was excited to travel with them I was also nervous I was setting myself up for a situation where I would get hurt. I asked them if they could avoid being too affectionate in front of me at least (also knowing that was the house rules as per the crush’s partner when I was seeing him) and they said they spoke to their crush and that they were on the same page. 
 
Well, the first night we were all watching a movie together and they are immediately quite touchy and affectionate with each other, and my partner goes out of their way to sit on him a couple times. It honestly hurt my feelings, especially that it was so immediate and when I talked to my partner later that night they denied being affectionate, said it was unfair of me to ask them to withhold themself and said I was bringing up childhood trauma by asking this of them and being hurt by their behaviour (they did have an extremely repressed childhood, which I do try to be mindful of and try to only assert boundaries when I know I really really can’t handle something). I honestly felt so bad after this conversation I wasn’t sure if I was in the wrong. 

The next day my friend/their crush noticed I was feeling weird and met up with me on my way back from work so we could talk (soo thankful he has always been on top of direct communication, it has made it so easy to go back to being comfortably friends even after everything), and I learned that he had actually not realized my partner was pursuing him romantically til a couple days before trip, at which point he had told them his relationship was closed and he didn’t feel the same toward them. He really sincerely felt so bad I had read into their actions the night before through a context of “these 2 want to be together but I am getting in the way of their fun” and assured me he thought it would be a dick move turning me down to close his relationship then immediately opening it up to date my partner. I apologized for thinking that he would do something like that, he apologized for the misunderstanding, & I felt a lot better about things. 

Howeverrr talking to my partner again didn’t go well. They maintained they had initiated the conversation telling their crush they needed to tone it down in front of me, tried to make me feel guilty for it, and accused me of not actually wanting to be poly (which they have done before). I told them their crush had told me things didn’t happen that way and they got quiet, but were still angry with me. They also said they didn’t take their crush’s rejection as such and planned on seeing where things went. We left the conversation there because it clearly wasn’t productive, and they did apologize later for not just communicating they weren’t up for talking and taking it out on me. They went to bed early and I hung out with my friend/the crush, who told me he planned on setting firmer boundaries with my partner. 

My partner later expressed they wanted me to not be there as they didn’t like hanging out with the 4 of us all together, and they were considering extending their stay so they could get alone time with our friends. I was hurt, and it made me feel anxious and kind of burdensome for being around. There was also a night I had to stay very late at work and my partner went to bed with our friends, and the next morning kept insinuating how they cuddled and telling me things I didn’t want to hear, and I had to ask them to save those thoughts to tell someone else about it. Honestly that was a bit too much for me, and I did check in with my friends who said they realized the next morning they felt it was too far for them too. There was also another night we went out for drinks, my partner got extremely drunk and when we went to bed they cried to me about “not being allowed to have anything nice”. 

I’ll skip a lot of the minutiae from here because this is getting so long but basically my friend set firmer boundaries, my partner ignored me for 2 days after and abruptly left group hangouts without saying anything a few times, though when I did text to ask if they were ok they did clarify they weren’t upset with me, just frustrated with some things they didn’t want to talk about. They talked again in private (not sure what about) on the last day of the trip and my partner came back and cried. 

We’re on our way home now and I don’t really know what to make of this. I think writing it all out is helping me come to terms with how much it all sucked. My partner did nice things too, like make me breakfast and buy me coffee, but they also did.. everything above. Is this salvageable? Is my only option to break up? I don’t even know where to begin with thinking about what needs to be done to fix things. Maybe I just need to hear I’m not crazy for feeling hurt by all this.

1niqwk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1niqwk3/reveal_if_the_best_mini_food_processor/,Reveal if the best mini food processor Black+Decker CG800B is worth it,"Testing out the Black+Decker CG800B has been quite an experience in my kitchen. With black as its sleek color, this mini food processor and coffee grinder combo immediately caught my eye. I loved how versatile and compact it is, especially when I’m tight on counter space. As someone who’s perpetually juggling between cooking and caffeinating, having a dual-purpose appliance sounded too good to pass up. It’s been in the lineup since 2009, and I can see why it caught on for many. This nifty gadget serves multiple purposes in a space-saving design, but there’s more to it than meets the eye.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things I noticed was the appliance's slim profile. Measuring approximately 9.65 x 8.07 x 5.51 inches and weighing just 3.4 pounds, it’s practically made for kitchens where space is a premium. The under-cabinet mounting option was a game-changer for me—it felt fantastic to reclaim my precious counter space. It even has cord storage, which made it feel tidier than my usual chaotic array of kitchen gadgets. Its black finish is classy and fits with a modern aesthetic, though I did find that the black color showed smudges a little more than I’d like.

**Functionality and Features**  
This compact workhorse boasts dual transparent containers; one features a rubberized lid, while the metal-bottomed one adds an extra layer of durability. I tried both containers for different functions, and switching between them was intuitive. From grinding up coffee beans with the stainless-steel blade designed for the job to chopping nuts and veggies with the alternate blade, the Black+Decker mini food processor handled everything I threw at it. These blades are sharp and efficient, though I recommend caution during cleanup. The pulse button came in handy for precision control, allowing me not to over-grind or over-process anything.  

[Check Black+Decker CG800B price on Amazon.](https://cncgn.com/p/b001tann7m/)

**Key Benefits**  
- Dual functionality as both a coffee grinder and mini food processor saves money and space.  
- Efficient stainless-steel blades handle grinding and chopping with ease.  
- Compact size and under-cabinet mounting keep your kitchen organized.  
- Transparent containers let you gauge processing without constant interruptions.

**Areas for Improvement**  
While I admired many aspects, a few things gave me pause.  
- The motor isn’t as powerful as I’d hoped for grinding tougher ingredients like frozen items or harder spices.  
- Cleaning wasn't as straightforward. Hand-washing was necessary as the components aren’t dishwasher-safe.  
- Overuse sometimes warmed the base slightly, though it didn’t feel unsafe—just something to be mindful of.  

**Performance in Daily Use**  
Switching between grinding coffee beans and mixing up a quick salsa was a breeze. I noticed that while grinding coffee resulted in a fairly consistent ground texture, tougher tasks like chopping harder nuts occasionally required multiple pulses. It’s not a dealbreaker but something to be aware of if you prioritize efficiency. Additionally, the noise level is average—loud enough to remind you it's working but not intrusive compared to competing products. Over prolonged use, its reliability shined through, though I wouldn’t push its limits with ingredients outside of its designed scope.

**Competing Products**  
While this mini food processor excels in storage and multi-purpose functionality, the Cuisinart DLC-2ABC and Hamilton Beach 72850 give it a run for its money. The Cuisinart has a slightly more powerful motor and offers better consistency with tougher jobs. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach processor delivers a quieter operation, which some may prefer. However, neither offers a dual purpose as both grinder and chopper, making the Black+Decker model a unique contender. Admittedly, the competitors make cleaning slightly easier with dishwasher-safe parts, which is worth considering for those who dread manual cleaning.

**Worth Every Penny**  
After putting it through its paces, I’d say the Black+Decker CG800B offers solid value for what it brings to the table—but only for the right user. If you crave efficiency, compact design, and the novelty of a two-in-one device, it’s worth investing in. Compared to pricier models with single functions, this one feels like a budget-smart choice when looking at versatility alone. That said, if your focus is sheer power or heavy-duty performance, checking out alternatives might be wiser.

I'm going to post all that we did (good, bad, ugly) for anyone that may be interested... 

  
We flew from North America straight to Melbourne on United. It was my first time using United Airlines for a long haul flight and it was fantastic. The seats were comfortable and the screens worked without difficulty. 

**Melbourne:**   
We landed in Melbourne around 8am local time. We stayed at Veriu Queen Victoria Market. Great location, hotel staff is very nice, decently clean. When we first walked into our room, it did smell a bit like sewer in the bathroom but after taking a shower it dissipated for the rest of the stay. The area by the market seemed a little sketchy at night - if I was walking alone without my partner I would've been uncomfortable. 

  
We had nothing planned for our first day. We walked around the queen victoria market (it's huge), Old Melbourne Gaol, State Library Victoria, Melbourne Parliament House (we didn't go at the right time for a free tour but we wished we had), Fitzroy Garden (really nice to sit and relax), Street art on AC/DC Lane etc., Flinders Street Station. For Flinders Street Station, they have an old-school photo booth that will some times attract a line. I love photo booths so it was on my list. You will need to have AUD coins and exact change to use it! It also goes very quickly once you pay so make sure you're ready! 

We got lunch at Fattie Prince which was very good. 

The following day we did a bike tour with blue tongue bikes. I'm not big on biking so I wasn't crazy about the tour - my partner however really enjoyed it. Our tour guide, Leo, was fantastic though. There will be moments where you're riding on the street which was quite scary for me personally! Bike tour went from 10am-2pm and we stopped for lunch during the tour. After the bike tour we went to an AFL game at Marvel Stadium. I'm not a big sports fan - but this was FANTASTIC! We bought tickets ahead of time but you can just go and buy GA tickets at the stadium. 

**Tasmania:**

The following morning we flew Virgin Australia from Melbourne to Hobart Tasmania. We landed around 10am and rented a car using Dollar Rental. My partner drove the whole time - driving on the ""wrong side"" is scary but easy to get the hang of. We stayed at Lodge on Elizabeth. Very cute, good location, clean, no smell - however, there's really no ""front desk"" staff. There's free street parking with a permit they provide you. After checking in, we walked to the pier and went to the MONA. This was definitely an experience. We're not necessarily big ""art"" people but it was fun to do and a very cool experience. We also ate lunch at the restaurant there. Expensive but good food and also added to the experience. 

The next day we took a tour for Port Arthur and the Tasman Peninsula. We used [Tours Tasmania](https://tourstas.rezdy.com/7126/port-arthur-day-tour-optional-devils-park-upgrade) \- our guide Dave (?) was great. He was very knowledgeable and entertaining. It is a fast paced tour as you're covering a lot in a short amount of time but we both had a great time on the tour. We did not upgrade to see the Tasmanian Devils so I can't speak to that. 

We left the next morning and drove to Mt. Field National Park. We did the Three Falls Circuit and got some food at Mt. Field. It was a bit chilly and rainy - you'd want layers and a decent rain jacket. We were spending the night in Queenstown at Gold Rush Inn. Along the way we stopped at Donaghys Hill and Horsetail Falls. Gold Rush Inn was a very spacious room and clean! 

The next day we headed to Cradle Mountain National Park. We stopped for coffee at Orangepete's - this was amazing! Orange Pete is a very nice guy and his wife bakes the most amazing sweets! We couldn't get enough. 

On our way to Cradle Mountain, a major road was closed due to snow they had gotten the night before. We had to call the visitors center to ask for a work-around however, with timing and our plan to spend the night in Launceston, we were advised to skip cradle mountain and go hike elsewhere. It would've taken us too long and too far out of the way to go the other route. :( We instead stopped at Christmas Hill Raspberry Farm Cafe and grabbed some lunch. Another great spot - very busy even in the middle of the week in winter! The food is delicious and you have to try their raspberry ice cream. We then stopped and hiked around Liffey Falls - this was a nice hike since we couldn't do cradle mountain! 

We spent the night in Launceston at Balmoral on York. The next day we did the cataract gorge scenic chairlift and suspension bridge (a nice area to walk around), and the reception at the hotel suggested we eat at Loira Vines. This place was incredible. Only go if you are hungry! The weather was quite crummy this day so we did some scenic drives along the area but didn't do much walking around. 

We left Tasmania that night on Jetstar and returned to Melbourne. 

**Melbourne**

We spent one day in Melbourne walking around the Fitzroy neighborhood - there are a lot of thrift stores in this area so it was fun to do some shopping and walking around. The following day we went to St. Kilda. Walked around the pier, Luna Park is cool to look at, had a good lunch at St. Kilda Mediterranean Food, and got (multiple) chocolate Kugelhopf from Monarch Cakes. 

We flew Melbourne to Cairns on Qantas the following morning, landing around 11:30am. 

**Cairns**

We stayed at the Coral Tree Inn - decent location but nothing ""fancy"". Someone on one of our tours was staying at the Flynn and it looked quite nice so if that's within budget for you, I'd say stay there. The day we got in, we just walked around the Esplanade. It's very interesting the way the tide changes during the day vs at night. 

Following day we booked a tour to snorkel in the Great Barrier Reef. My partner and I are not big snorkel people. He's not really a fan of swimming and I had never snorkeled before. We used [SeaStar](https://seastarcruises.com.au/) for this tour. I thought it was fantastic. The guides are very knowledgeable and were very experienced. They obviously love what they do. They have gopro under water cameras to take photos of you (if you want) and take you on ""tours"" of the reef in the water. They point out different fish and coral so you know what you're looking at. You have the option to ""dive"" as an add-on but we were not interested in doing that (too scared). They provided wetsuits for us, had coffee + tea + muffins in the morning, lunch in between sites. They also have an included glass bottom boat ride so you're able to see areas you wouldn't be able to snorkeling. The tour is small \~30 people. My partner and I both had a fantastic time doing this. 

The next day we took a tour of the [Daintree Rainforest and Mossman Gorge using Discovery Tours Australia](https://www.discoverytours.com.au/tour/daintree-cape-tribulation-premium-rainforest-tour). I honestly think we got very lucky with our guide, Steve. He was FANTASTIC! We wished we could hire him for a private tour. It seemed as though this man had lived 100 lives and had so much knowledge about aboriginal life and culture along with the nature and trees. He showed us so much stuff that was incredible! It was another small tour - maybe 15 people? 

The next day was a ""free"" day. My partner wanted more hike/outdoorsy so he booked another tour on barefoot tours of a half day waterfall tour. It just so happened that besides us, one other couple had booked this tour. So there were 4 of us and a guide. The guide we had was very nice but she was also quite new to Australia and Cairns. I brought my bathing suit and we went to a few different gorges/waterfalls and got to go swim in them! The water was cold but manageable! She also had a nice camera that she took photos of us on and uploaded them for us! 

We left Cairns for Sydney that night on Jetstar. 

**Sydney**

We arrived in Sydney around 10pm. We stayed at YEHS Hotel Sydney QVB. Whatever you do, **DO NOT STAY HERE!** The hotel was horrible. The only good thing was the location. Our room was dirty, had hair in the sink that was not from us, the drain had mold in it, it smelled like sewage, the staff was not friendly... just a horrible experience. 

We woke up the next day and did the Bondi to Coogee Beach walk. We then went to the State Library of NSW and the Royal Botanic Garden of Sydney. That night, we saw a symphony at the Sydney Opera House in the main concert hall. This was a great experience! There really is not a bad seat in the hall. 

The following day we had a tour of the Sydney Opera House. We signed up for the architecture tour - neither my partner nor I know anything about architecture. It was a very interesting, well-explained tour! We walked around the area a bit and then headed back to the Botanic Gardens for a aboriginal tour. The guide was again very knowledgeable about aboriginal history of Australia and was very candid about the not so great past. He had a lot of great insight. After this, we headed to the Engie Stadium for another AFL game! After the AFL game ended, we were walking around the area as it was the Olympic Park. We noticed a lot of people walking into the Accor Stadium and realized there was a rugby game going on. We snagged tickets for that and saw a rugby game! The one we saw was a bit boring, but seeing the stadium was quite cool for my partner. 

The next day we checked out of our horrible hotel and hopped on the train to Katoomba. We stayed at the Carrington Hotel which was fantastic compared to the Sydney hotel we were staying in previously. The hotel and rooms are full of stained glass windows. It was beautiful. We got to Katoomba, dropped off our stuff, grabbed some sandwiches and headed to the Blue Mountains. My partner found some trails on AllTrails - but we did the Three Sister and some other loops in that area. There were a lot of people in the beginning and kids! But if you keep going, you'll be able to hear the birds and it's quite peaceful. 

The next day we woke up and went back to Blue Mountains, this time we took a bus and did the Grand Canyon loop. Much less people, and really beautiful hike. 

We checked out the next day and did some shopping in the area at the thrift stores before heading back to Sydney. We were originally planning on staying at the same Sydney hotel, however, I cancelled the ""second"" booking the first night we stayed there. I booked us an [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/809013965529443984?source_impression_id=p3_1758048229_P36k_GibJWpB55wn) instead - great location, very spacious, clean, no sewage smell. That afternoon we took the Manly Ferry. Walked around Manly and went to the Manly Art Gallery & Museum (this is free and really incredible). 

Our last day we went to the Anzac Memorial, St. Mary's Cathedral, and the Art Gallery of NSW. It started to really downpour rain so we took our time in the two art gallery buildings. 

We flew back to North America the following morning!

When water stops flowing smoothly, it can cause bad odors, standing water, and even long-term plumbing damage. Knowing how to handle a clogged drain pipe quickly and effectively not only saves time but also prevents bigger plumbing issues.

# Common Causes of a Clogged Kitchen Drain

Clogged sinks often happen because everyday waste builds up in your pipes. Some of the most common culprits include:

* Grease and cooking oil solidifying inside the pipes.
* Food scraps or coffee grounds accumulating.
* Soap scum forming sticky residue.
* Small foreign objects accidentally falling into the drain.

# Best Methods to Clear a Clogged Kitchen Sink

# 1. Try Hot Water and Dish Soap:

Pouring boiling water mixed with dish soap down the sink can help break down grease. This is the simplest first step and often works for mild clogs.

# 2. Use a Plunger:

A sink plunger creates suction and pressure that loosens food particles stuck in the drain pipe. It’s a quick fix before moving to advanced solutions.

# 3. Baking Soda and Vinegar Solution:

Pour half a cup of baking soda followed by vinegar. After letting it fizz for about 15 minutes, flush it with hot water. This natural method is safe and effective for minor clogs.

If these DIY steps don’t work, you may need professional help. Searching for [drain cleaning near you](https://www.weathertekfl.com/drain-repair-installation-service/) ensures you get fast service to clear stubborn blockages before they affect other areas of your plumbing.

# Preventing Future Clogs in Your Kitchen Sink

1. Avoid Pouring Grease Down the Drain
2. Dispose of grease in a container instead of letting it harden inside pipes.
3. Use a Sink Strainer
4. A simple sink strainer prevents food scraps and debris from slipping into the drain pipe.
5. Regularly Flush with Hot Water
6. Running hot water after washing dishes keeps pipes clear of buildup.

# Conclusion

Clearing a clogged kitchen sink doesn’t have to be stressful. From natural home remedies to professional plumbing solutions, you can get your drains flowing smoothly again. Staying proactive with prevention will keep your kitchen sink in top condition and save you from expensive repairs down the line.",1,1758049985.0,u_weathertek,0,1.0,False

Just got a bambino and df54 combo a few days ago and struggling to dial it in.

The taste is one thing I'm working on but another is that I find that I get shots that are just lukewarm? 

The steaming function is hot, it's also hot enough when I run it without any beans, but as soon as there's grinds in the basket, it comes out lukewarm. I've been warming it up by running it blank first as a double shot and warming up the cup, but the problem remains.

How could it be that having 18g of coffee in the basket is enough to cool down my shots so much? It's also ~24°C in the room so that's not an issue.

The G3 Plus immediately stood out, thanks to its compact size and sleek black design. Measuring just 4.48 x 4.17 x 1.67 inches and weighing barely over two pounds, this mini PC was almost dwarfed by my coffee mug. Yet, despite its unassuming size, this machine has quite a few surprises up its sleeve. Equipped with the Intel Twin Lake N150 processor, 16GB DDR4 RAM, and a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD, it promised a balance of speed, performance, and storage, and trust me—I put those promises to the test.

**Innovative and Compact Design**  
One thing that immediately drew me to this mini computer is its minimalistic and highly portable build. It’s the kind of device you can easily carry in one hand, perfect for someone like me who’s often shifting setups between home and the office. Its black matte finish complements most workspaces, and it doesn’t scream for attention on your desk. Despite being tiny, the G3 Plus isn’t flimsy. Its metal-and-plastic combination casing feels durable enough to endure being jostled in a backpack. Space efficiency is where this device scores big, especially for smaller home setups or minimalist office environments.

**Performance for Everyday Tasks**  
Powered by the Intel Twin Lake N150, this mini PC doesn’t shy away from performance. I used it extensively for routine tasks like web browsing, video calls, and office applications, and it fired up without hesitation. The processor, pushing up to 3.6GHz, handled multitasking quite well. Switching between multiple Chrome tabs, including YouTube videos, document editing tools, and my email client, was seamless. For casual users or home office warriors, the G3 Plus comfortably gets the job done. The 16GB DDR4 RAM shines here, ensuring there’s no noticeable lag—even with resource-heavy applications. Boot-up times are incredibly quick thanks to the 1TB NVMe SSD, which also allowed me to load, save, and transfer large files faster than expected.  

**[Ready to buy GMKtec G3 Plus? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://genericprint.com/p/b0cq4c9zy1/)**  

**Sharp 4K Display for Dual Screens**  
Visuals on this compact device were another big win. With upgraded Intel Graphics supporting 4K@60Hz on dual screens, the Mini PC added a professional edge to my workspace. Connecting it to my two 27-inch monitors via the HDMI 2.0 ports was straightforward, and both screens displayed crisp, smooth visuals. Video playback was clean with zero noticeable stutter, even on 4K videos. I even experimented by connecting the device to my living room projector, turning it into a mini home theater setup. Streaming services ran effortlessly, and AV1 decoding elevated the playback experience—making it an appealing choice for entertainment buffs.

**Versatile Connectivity Options**  
The plethora of ports and connectivity features really sets the G3 Plus apart. It has four USB 3.2 ports, two HDMI 2.0 slots, a 3.5mm audio jack, and an RJ45 Ethernet connection supporting 2.5GbE speeds. Adding to that are Bluetooth 5.2 and Wi-Fi 6, which provide blazing-fast speeds for wireless devices. Between my wireless keyboard, mouse, and printer, there was zero connection hiccup. I appreciated the inclusion of Wake On LAN and Auto Power On features—a feature handy in certain IT setups or for users running their PC as a server.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact and space-saving design suitable for small desks and setups  
- Strong performance for routine office tasks and multitasking  
- Impressive 4K dual-screen display support with smooth video playback  
- 1TB NVMe SSD ensures fast file transfers and excellent storage capacity  
- Reliable wireless features with Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2  

**Drawbacks**  
- The integrated graphics card lacks the muscle for hardcore gaming or demanding graphics work  
- Fans can get slightly audible under extended heavy loads, which some might find distracting  
- Limited upgradeability compared to traditional desktops  

**Other Options**  
If you’re like me, you might wonder how this mini PC stacks up against competitors. In comparison to the Beelink SER5 Mini PC, the G3 Plus offers similar storage and processor speed but falls slightly shy in handling professional design software. However, the addition of Wi-Fi 6 and better dual-screen support helps it hold its ground. Meanwhile, the Intel NUC series provides top-end models with more comprehensive customization possibilities, though they’re pricier. For everyday home or office use, the G3 Plus offers immense value thanks to its versatility and features.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Given its range of specifications, the price tag of the G3 Plus feels reasonable. Sure, it’s not for graphic designers or hardcore gamers, but for light-to-medium workloads, it delivers in spades. Within its category of mini PCs, it balances performance and affordability exceptionally well. If you want something reliable for work, studying, or light entertainment, the G3 Plus punches well above its weight.

The brand new romantic comedy from the most famous digital steamer, debuted recently and has already achieved great success. starring former Nickelodeon teen star Miranda Cosgrove, in her second original work on Netflix (her first original work on the streamer was “Mother of the Bride”, another recent big hit on the platform) and Pierson fodé (the perfect date).

Summary - 

Dawn (Miranda Cosgrove), a metallurgical artist, lives in the interior of the American state of Texas, with her grandmother Bird, her and her sisters, dreaming of following in her mother's footsteps and becoming an artist in fact, Dawn, responsible, dedicated herself for a long time to working in a local coffee shop due to her private financial fund to study arts in Paris, in fact she manages to be approved at university, however without the full scholarship her savings are insufficient.
However, one of her sisters, and a fan of reality shows, suggested that she sign up for the current production, the “Honeypot”, a women's competition with 20 thousand dollars guaranteed to those selected for the big competition in search of the keys to the heart of a rich single man, which conveniently would take place in the city of lights, or that's what the participants thought.
Selected and gaining the affection of one of the program's producers, Dawn finds herself ready to go home to the Eiffel Tower, but is surprised by the production's prank, and the primary cause of the film's name, landing in Paris, Texas, less than 100km from her home. Remaining in the dispute only for contractual reasons, she soon arouses the interest of the current millionaire Trey McAllen III (Pierson Fodé), a handsome cowboy, initially determined to be eliminated, throughout the dispute between tests and intrigues typical of reality shows in confinement and a few moments extra game she will allow herself to live this passion. 

Comments and opinion:

Home to many successful relationship reality shows, Netflix mocks its own
productions, since the beginning Honeypot and presented as a self-criticism, properly a parody of the reality show genre, the entire structure and characters involved in the dispute are stereotypes of the most frequent human types to expose themselves in front of the cameras, the rich and spoiled influencer, the old school biker girl, the nerd, the free lover, the forgotten celebrity, alternative girl, etc.,
The film was directed by Janeen Damian, with experience in the romantic comedy genre, she has already directed two other Netflix productions in the same style: Christmas Eve and Irish Wish, in The Wrong Paris she inserts all the common and pleasant elements of romantic comedies, being quite predictable, which is no demerit, after all, when watching films or series of this type we want an escape valve from the chaotic everyday life where we have little or almost no control over what is going on around us, the constant presence of Dawn's family members and an especially pleasant difference, constituting the viewer's voice within the film.
Especially her grandmother bird, an emotional component of the plot, recurrently advises her granddaughter and frequently encourages her granddaughter, sometimes interfering in the story that the more anxious audience would like to do for themselves, Miranda brings the beauty of the film with lightness and humanity, it is perfectly possible to be indignant with her regarding the “villa's” not at all discreet advances on the handsome millionaire, she conveys the character's insecurities well, and definitely makes us fall in love with her too, an essential element for any romantic comedy that is cherish. Pierson fulfilled what was necessary for his character, he delivers someone who is attentive, concerned, handsome and very much in love with the protagonist, there could have been a slight touch more chemistry between the two characters (annoying mine? maybe).
told with beautiful landscapes and an interesting cast, the film also stands out for the quality of its production, ideal for the genre of romantic comedies, despite this, the film's story could be better worked =, with 1 and 4 minutes and duration the extremely light story (a good sign) passes too quickly, it could have a better development of the village and the protagonist's confidant, through dialogues between them and the protagonist, and in my opinion it could have more frank dialogues between the protagonist couple, giving a more solid basis for the passion between the two, some moments between Paris Texas and Paris Paris seem to occur with an expressed passion without much emotional basis, perhaps 15 more minutes of film wouldn't hurt the production.
with an insightful critique in the background of the futility of influences and the world of reality shows, limited to the formulas of the genre, it could have promised beyond a simple romantic comedy, light and pleasant for the evening in which you just have to turn off your brain and disconnect from your busy routine with cute moments starring passionate characters, and it would have easily delivered, I think it was designed to be a single film but, there could have been a sequel expanding this wonderful universe, especially Dawn's relationship with her family, especially her sisters,

Everyone says to continue to self improve but I’ve  already made senior analyst and I make $100k a year. I’m not overweight and I’m 6’5” so I think my issue is a sourcing/approaching. I’d like to find a woman that is educated like myself, Christian, and has a full time job. I can try and push to get to $125k in 2 years and push for a promotion… but that’s a slow push. I’d like to get to $200k before I’m 30 though so that’s a focus I have to plan out. 

I can go to sports events, worship and prayer events, run clubs. But this kinda burns me out because I have a full time job too. I really want to just grind it out and approach 100 women and finally get a gf I like. I don’t really care how bold I have to be, I’m just determined to make it happen at this point. After church, coffee shops, heck on the street… I’m tired of waiting so I’m going to do something about it. 

I also want to work more on self improvement - the gym, additional education stuff for my career, becoming the best but I find I hate most of the social stuff because it’s an absurd waste of time. I’m most happy when I’m working out, at the bar with my guy friends, at Bible study, house parties, etc. Yet I feel like I’m not doing enough for a relationship.

That's what my life has come to. Six months in county jail, lost my house, lost my husband, lost my kids, and now I'm living in my sister's basement like some kind of criminal. Which I guess I am.

It started two years ago when I did the stupidest thing of my life. My husband and I had been married for twelve years. Two kids, nice house in the suburbs, the whole thing. But I was bored. God, I was so bored. He worked long hours, came home tired, and we barely talked anymore.

Then this guy started coming to my yoga class. Younger, charming, always complimenting me. One thing led to another. We started texting, then meeting for coffee, then meeting at his apartment. I told myself it was just fun, just something to feel alive again.

My husband found out six months later. He went through my phone while I was sleeping. Woke up to him standing over me, holding my phone, this look on his face I'd never seen before.

""Get out,"" he said. That's all. Just ""get out.""

I panicked. Called my mom crying, went to stay with her. She was furious but not at me.

""Men always do this,"" she said. ""They neglect their wives then act surprised when someone else pays attention. You need to fight for your marriage.""

My whole family rallied around me. My sister said he was overreacting. My dad said all men have affairs and women forgive them, so why shouldn't my husband forgive me? They convinced me I was the victim here. That he'd driven me to it by working too much, by not being romantic enough.

My mom even paid for a lawyer. ""Take him for everything,"" she said. ""That house is half yours. Those kids need their mother.""

But my husband had already filed for divorce. And he'd started dating someone new. Some woman from his office. When I saw them together at the coffee shop near our house, my house, something in me snapped.

My family had been filling my head with poison for weeks. ""She's a homewrecker,"" my sister said. ""She probably had her eye on him before you even separated."" My mom kept saying, ""Show him you won't be replaced so easily.""

I sat in my car watching them laugh together. She touched his hand across the table. He smiled in a way he hadn't smiled at me in years.

I don't remember deciding to do it. One second I was gripping the steering wheel, the next I was driving straight at them as they walked to her car. She jumped out of the way. Barely missed her. Hit three parked cars instead.

The cops arrested me right there in the parking lot. Attempted assault with a deadly weapon. My husband just stood there watching them put me in handcuffs. Didn't say a word.

My family hired the best lawyer they could afford. Tried to argue temporary insanity, crimes of passion, all that. The judge didn't buy it. Six months in county jail, two years probation, and a restraining order keeping me away from my husband and his girlfriend.

While I was locked up, the divorce went through. My husband got full custody. Got the house too since I'd been arrested for a violent crime. My lawyer said I was lucky he didn't push for supervised visitation only.

When I got out, I thought my kids would at least want to see me. They're teenagers now, fourteen and sixteen. Old enough to make their own choices. But when I called, my daughter answered and said, ""Dad told us we don't have to talk to you if we don't want to. And we don't want to.""

My son texted me once. ""Mom, you tried to kill someone. You're crazy. Leave us alone.""

Even my family is different now. My mom still defends me but it's halfhearted. ""Well, you shouldn't have actually tried to hurt anyone,"" she says now, like she wasn't the one telling me to fight for my marriage. My sister lets me stay in her basement but makes comments about keeping her car keys hidden. My dad won't even look at me.

The worst part? That woman, his girlfriend? They're engaged now. My kids like her. My daughter posts pictures with her on Instagram. ""Shopping with my future stepmom!"" Like I don't exist. Like I didn't give birth to her, didn't stay up all night when she was sick, didn't drive her to dance class for ten years.

I know I messed up. I know cheating was wrong. But everyone acts like I'm some kind of monster for trying to save my family. My husband cheated too, just did it after we separated so somehow that makes it okay? He moved on in five minutes while I lost everything.

I can't get a job because of my record. Can't get an apartment because no one wants to rent to someone with a violent crime conviction. Can't see my kids because they hate me. Can't move forward because everyone sees me as the crazy ex-wife who tried to run someone over.

My therapist, the one the court makes me see, says I need to take responsibility. But how much more can I take? I lost everything. I paid for my mistakes. When is it enough?

AITA for wanting my kids to at least hear my side of the story?

1niqgyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AmandaTracy22/comments/1niqgyd/chapter_four_the_woman_with_a_secret/,Chapter Four: The Woman with a Secret,"The dream came with suffocating force. Clara found herself in a narrow alley, the air damp and heavy with the stench of decay. The walls pressed inward, slick with rain and shadow. From somewhere ahead came a scream—sharp, desperate, unmistakably human. Clara’s pulse thundered in her ears as she ran forward, boots echoing against the cobblestones.

At the far end of the alley, under a flickering streetlamp, a young woman was struggling. Her hands clawed the air as she cried for help, her voice raw with terror. Clara stretched out her arm, shouting, “I’m here! Hold on!” But no sound left her lips. She tried again, forcing her voice to rise, but the silence swallowed everything.

She sprinted, legs burning, heart desperate. Yet the space between her and the girl only widened, as if the alley itself was stretching endlessly, mocking her efforts. The girl’s screams grew sharper, more frantic. And then—he appeared.

A figure cloaked in black, hood drawn so low that his face was nothing but shadow. He moved with terrifying calm, stepping toward the girl. She tried to escape, her body jerking with panic, but Clara’s legs felt like stone. She couldn’t reach her. Couldn’t stop him.

The hooded figure drew a blade. Under the flickering light, steel caught the glint of doom. Clara’s throat ached as she screamed a soundless cry, watching helplessly as the stranger drove the weapon down. The girl’s scream cut off abruptly, echoing in the alley before dissolving into silence.

Clara collapsed to her knees, powerless. The faceless figure lifted his head slightly, as if aware of her presence. Though no eyes were visible, she felt his gaze pierce her like a dagger. A whisper slithered through the shadows:

“You can’t save them.”

Clara woke with a gasp, her body drenched in cold sweat. Her heart hammered violently, dragging her back into reality. For a moment she sat in darkness, hands gripping the sheets, forcing herself to breathe.

Finally, she rose. In the kitchen, the bitter aroma of coffee filled the air as she poured herself a cup, grounding her trembling hands against the warmth. The night’s terror still lingered, a phantom weight pressing on her chest.

A soft knock pulled her from her thoughts. She turned to see the housekeeper—the same maid who had slipped the note into her pocket the night before. The woman’s posture was hesitant, her eyes darting as if afraid the walls themselves might hear.

“My name is Heidi,” she said in a hushed voice. “We need to talk, Detective.”

Clara gestured for her to sit, studying her carefully as she wrapped her fingers around the steaming cup. Heidi’s hands trembled when she folded them in her lap.

“You wrote this,” Clara said, holding up the note. “‘I know something that will help you, but I need your protection.’ What is it that you know?”

Heidi drew in a shaky breath. “I’ve served the Bellamys for many years. I know more than I should… and I’ve seen things no one should ever see.” Her voice faltered, but then she continued, eyes glistening. “Richard Bellamy—the master of the house before he died—he and I… we were close. Too close. We had an affair, though it was something I carried in silence, hidden from everyone. He trusted me in ways he trusted no one else.”

Clara’s brow tightened. “Richard died last year. Mysteriously. Like Christine.”

Heidi nodded, lowering her eyes. “Yes. And before his death, he was consumed by one thing: the curse. He believed it haunted his family for centuries. He told me that long ago, one of the Bellamys struck a pact—a dark agreement that demanded blood. Every generation, someone in the family must die. A sacrifice.”

Her words trembled in the air, weighed with fear.

Clara sipped her coffee, her voice steady but skeptical. “You’re telling me your employer believed his family was cursed? That they were bound by some… supernatural contract?”

“Yes,” Heidi whispered urgently. “He obsessed over it. He studied the deaths in his lineage, looking for patterns, for proof. He swore that the curse demanded its price year after year, and if it wasn’t paid willingly… it would claim someone violently.”

Clara leaned forward, locking eyes with her. “Heidi, I deal with evidence, not folklore. Curses don’t kill people—people do. And whoever killed Christine left traces, clues. That’s what I’m looking for.”

Heidi’s voice cracked. “You may not believe, Detective. But I saw the fear in him. Richard was terrified, and now Christine is dead. If there is no curse, then why does this family lose one of their own every year, as if the pattern is carved into stone?”

Clara remained silent, her mind balancing between logic and the weight of Heidi’s fear. She didn’t believe in curses. Yet she couldn’t ignore the look in the woman’s eyes—the kind of fear that made people hide in their own homes, afraid of shadows.

Finally, Heidi leaned closer, lowering her voice to a whisper. “If you want answers, talk to Frederick. Richard’s son. I’ve seen him enter a room—a forbidden room. No one else is allowed inside. Not even the servants. I don’t know what’s in there, but he goes often, always alone.”

Clara’s pulse quickened, the pieces forming in her mind. “Where is this room?”

Heidi shook her head. “Hidden in the east wing. I can’t go there. I won’t. But you—if you truly want to stop this… you must find out what he keeps inside.”

The room fell silent except for the ticking of the old grandfather clock in the corner. Clara set down her empty cup, her decision heavy but inevitable.

She glanced once more at the diary tucked safely among her belongings, its warning echoing in her mind: “Those who ignore the curse shall find themselves claimed. Watch the patterns; trust no one.”

Outside, the wind howled against the windows, carrying whispers through the halls of the mansion. Clara Hayes knew one thing for certain: the Bellamy estate was more than a crime scene. It was a labyrinth of secrets, each step drawing her closer to truths that threatened to devour her.

And now, a forbidden room awaited.",1,1758049281.0,u_AmandaTracy22,0,1.0,False

She was my best friend for 5 years, we got along instantly and were really close. But here is the thing, she was always kinda toxic to other people, especially to her partner and even tho it didn't bother me at first, last year of us being friends it kinda started to affect me in a way, even tho it wasn't really directed to me at first or it wasn't that bad towards me. 

I was always being honest with her and told her if she did something wrong or that she needs to work on herself, but she never did. I used to be at a very bad place mentally, but was working on getting better and have got much, much better. Still I felt as if she was dragging me down. I would constantly feel down after hanging out with her, like my energy would be gone in a minute.

Some times forward and I met my boyfriend. We instantly clicked and started dating really fast. When I told her about him even before we got in a relationship, she didn't really have any reaction and didn't show me any sign that she was happy for me. That hurt a lot actually. A bit after she started saying mean things about my bf (she never met him and I told her just good things about him), that he was manipulating me, that she doesn't support me being with him..., just because we made it official pretty fast. And that was the turning point for me.

It was really hurtful to hear her say all those things, I felt as if she doesn't want me to be happy and see me get better. Also, I don't let anyone talk shit about people I care about, no mater who you are to me. After all that we went for a coffee and I told her i don't see our friendship continuing.

I feel really bad because I know she is hurt by this, but I'm working on actually putting myself as my no. 1 priority, since my whole life I was a people pleaser. Still I feel like I overreacted.

THE STORY  
**Adventure of Skull Coast**

**Chapter One**

The cold bit at her fingers as she knocked on the heavy, oak door. She pulled her jacket tighter around her body and wished that she had brought a thicker coat. As Naomi waited, she heard two voices shouting from behind the door and bickering. The curtains were drawn and Naomi could see nothing through the big bay window.

“Jamie! Answer the door!” a woman shouted.

“I’m getting more crisps!” a man’s voice bellowed in return. Naomi presumed his voice to be Jamie. “You answer it!”

“You’ve put three bowls out already!” the woman replied. “For five people. Now answer the door!”

Naomi began to step away from the door. Maybe this was not it, maybe it was too soon. She felt the usual twist in her throat, that sickening anxious feeling that told her to run away. A great gust of wind scattered locks of brown hair across Naomi’s face and she wiped her fringe away, when the door finally opened. She looked up at the tall man looming in the doorway. Craning her neck up to look at him made her feel small.

“I’m sorry for the wait,” the man greeted.

He was well over a foot taller than Naomi. The wind pulled at his messy blonde mop of hair. Naomi looked up at him and was about to greet him when her voice stopped, trapped, caught in her throat. She tried a short wave and a smile.

“Are you here for the board game group?” Jamie asked. “I’m Jamie, come on inside.”

Naomi nodded. She had seen the advert online and applied, wanting to get out of her house more and hopefully make some new friends. Since the crash she had locked herself away, secluded herself from the world, and she so desperately needed to get back out. But now that she was face-to-face with someone, she found she was too anxious to speak.

“Y-yes,” she managed to say, raspily forcing the word out.

“Oh it’s cold,” he said and rubbed at his unsleeved arms. “Would you like a cup of tea or coffee?”

He stepped to one side to let Naomi inside of the house. She hesitated for a moment, then stepped inside, shuffling past Jamie. It was a lovely home. Naomie wondered what Jamie did for work, to afford this place in the middle of the city? A long, wide hallway with wooden floors separated the staircase on the left from the doorways on the right. A fourth door sealed away a small room under the stairs, Naomi guessed it was a closet or bathroom. At the end of the hallway, through an open door, Naomi spotted the kitchen.

“Living room is the first door on the right,” Jamie said as he held a hand out towards the nearest door.

“Thank you,” Naomi replied. Though she looked at the two other doors before the kitchen. This house was huge.

“The first toilet is down the hall, on the left, below the stairs,” Jamie told her. “And if that’s occupied, the second toilet is upstairs directly opposite the staircase.”

“I-is this your house?” Naomi asked, as soon as she had spoken she regretted it. Was that question too personal?

She pushed the door to the living room open and saw a woman lounging in a cream armchair. The woman sat with her legs propped over one arm of the chair and her back resting on the other arm: The other voice Naomi had heard. She looked up, smiled at Naomi, then went back to reading her book. Naomi’s attention was caught by the wide bay window on her right, with curtains closed, cushions as seats in the alcove. The room felt too tidy, a cream sofa and matching two-seater made a corner on one side of the room, with a coffee table in the middle. The other half of the room was open, occupied solely by a soft cream rug. Naomi felt as though she would accidentally leave a mark or scuff if she made even the slightest wrong move.

“My parent’s house,” Jamie answered. “I only live around the corner and my parents go out on Saturday nights. So they let me use the house for a board game night.”

“That’s very generous of them,” Naomi replied.

“They’re like that,” Jamie said.

“How very dare they,” the woman in the lounge chair mocked, in a fake snobby voice, before she broke into a giggle.

This earned a smile from Jamie. “Don’t mind my cousin. She’s here to play as well.”

Naomi spied the heap of food, snacks and sweets, three bowls of crisps, two bottles of cola and a stack of plastic cups. Her stomach clenched; she had not eaten all day. If the coffee table was so heavy with food, where were they going to play board games?

“We’re still expecting two more people,” Jamie said. “Once everyone is here and settled in, we’ll go into the dining room to play. The table in there is plenty big enough.” As if on cue, three knocks hit the door. “I’ll get the door.”

Jamie left and Naomi was along with the other woman.

After a moment of silence and standing still in the middle of the room, Naomi tried to greet the other woman. “I-i’m Naomi,” she offered.

The lounging woman looked up from her book, which Naomi now saw was a rules book for a board game. “Natalie,” she replied.

It was difficult to tell with how she was sitting, but Natalie seemed tall with long legs. Her primped, blonde hair hung in delicate rivulets over her shoulder. 

“Nice to meet you, Natalie,” Naomi said. She felt as though she was speaking like a robot, monotone and rigid. “We both have names starting with… With a *n*.”

“Right…” Natalie closed the rule book. “Would you like to sit down?”

Naomi nodded and crossed the room to sit on the two-seater. She could hear voices from outside, Jamie and the new arrival, and they seemed to be talking instead of coming inside. Two men were talking, Jamie the loudest, and the other was quiet but firm. Then Naomi was sure she heard a third voice, when Jamie and the other stopped, a soft whisper of a voice as though someone too shy to speak up. Which only made Naomi annoyed at herself for how anxious she was behaving. She heard the front door close just before all three people came into the living, Jamie ushering them inside.

The first to enter was a tall, gangly man with cropped ginger hair, shaved short on the back and sides. He was even taller than Jamie and his limbs seemed altogether too long and ungainly for him to manage. As soon as was in the room he turned to wave at Naomi and Natalie but instead bumped the handbag of the shorter woman following behind. Naomi saw his big shoes, a pair of black converse, had already scuffed the cream rug he stood on.

“Oh, sorry,” he said before turning back to the other two women. “Hi! I’m Daniel. I saw the advert online for a board game group. Are we all playing board games together?” A pair of black headphones covered his ears and he spoke loudly over the sound of whatever music he was listening to.

“Try taking the headphones off, buddy,” Jamie said as he brushed past the two guests and joined Naomi on the two-seater.

Naomi felt her spine tingle and she shuffled to the edge of the seat. She hoped to pretend like she was only leaning comfortably on the chair, though she felt awkward the moment Jamie had sat down. Naomi wanted to put just a little more space between him and herself. Daniel pulled the headphones off, letting them rest around his neck, and he immediately frowned.

“I’m Sarah,” the woman said in the quietest, softest voice. Naomi found herself leaning forward as though that would help her hear.

“This house is big,” Daniel blurted out.

“Yeah, thanks, it’s my parent’s house,” Jamie replied.

“Oh nice. What do they do for work?” Daniel asked, his tone flat.

“My mom’s a dentist, and my dad works at a bank doing… Something with money,” Jamie said with a shrug.

“That’s cool,” Daniel said, though Naomi thought his tone said otherwise. “What do you do?”

“I just live around the corner but they let me use the house while they’re out on Saturdays,” Jamie continued to explain. “Does everybody want to get comfortable and have a seat?”

They both followed, sitting on far sides of the three seat sofa. Daniel’s knees poked upward as the sofa was too low for his long legs. His hands idly played with the headphones hung around his neck. But Sarah seemed to relax into her seat. She set her handbag onto the floor beside the soda and brushed a long strand of black hair from her face. The two sofas connected at one corner, so that ended up sitting next to Naomi. Naomi offered her a soft smile and Sarah smiled back, batting her eye lashes.

“Is this everyone you’re expecting?” Natalie asked and Jamie nodded his answer. “That’s great, maybe a round of introductions?”

“And help yourself to food,” Jamie added. “There’s more crisps if we get low.” Natalie shot him a glare and he only offered her a sheepish smile.

Naomi was too uncomfortable to eat in front of everyone else, but her stomach churned at the scent of salt and vinegar. Maybe if someone else ate first, Naomi figured she would be okay to eat as well.

“I’m Daniel,” Daniel said again. “I saw the advert online and it said we were playing *Adventures of Skull Coast*?”

“Yes, that’s what Natalie and I want to play,” Jamie answered. “But if anyone wants a different game, we can switch.” He had already greeted each person at the door.

“That’s me, I’m Natalie,” she said with a casual wave of her hand. “If we are playing *Adventures of Skull Coast*, I’ll be narrating and running the game, since I lost a coin flip to Jamie.”

“Erm, I don’t know much about board games or tabletop games,” Sarah said and everyone hushed to hear her speak. Her voice was gentle, sweet, with a slight lilt from an accent she had nearly lost.

Naomi smiled at Sarah. “Me neither.”

“And you are?” Sarah asked, smiling back.

Naomi did not answer for a second and the room was quiet except for Daniel humming to himself as he ate crisps. She looked at Sarah, leaning towards her to hear her soft voice. “Oh,” she realised she had been staring. “I’m Naomi.” She felt sick. Why had she been staring? They were all going to think she was rude.

“Hi, Naomi,” Sarah replied, her big, brown eyes still watching Naomi.

Daniel dove into the crisps, grabbing a handful and stuffing them into his mouth. “Are we choosing our own characters?”

“Oh, yes, we will be,” Jamie answered. “You all pick your character and role.”

“We won’t be using any supplementary materials, so just the characters that come with the base game,” Natalie added.

“Nice, vanilla is less messy,” Daniel added. He wiped his greasy fingertips on his jeans. “I want to be the Parrot Pirate!” He was still wiping his fingers on his black jeans, over and over.

“Is something *vanilla* flavoured?” Sarah asked.

Jamie leaned towards her to speak as softly as Sarah had. “Vanilla just means the base game without any added. There are extra box sets that you can buy, to play the game in new ways, and some players like to make up their own content for the game too. But vanilla is easier to learn as a first time player.”

“Great, because I’m a first time player,” Sarah said softly, a smile gracing her velvety lips. Naomi found herself smiling along with her.

“Me too,” Naomi added. “At board games, I mean. Not that you didn’t mean board games. I just… I’ve not played this game before either.”

“Well I look forward to playing with you,” Sarah replied with that soft smile on her plump lips.

“When do we play?” Daniel asked, his loud voice snapping Naomi back to reality.

She blinked, suddenly aware she had been staring at Sarah again. Her cheeks flushed with warmth, and she dropped her gaze to her lap, hoping her racing heart would slow. Naomi glanced back at Sarah and found she was looking back. Then Sarah turned her attention to a pack of biscuits that had been opened onto a plate.

“When everyone’s ready,” Jamie answered. “Does anybody want anything else to eat?”

“You made a lot of food,” Daniel replied. His fingers twiddled the tasselled corner of a sofa cushion.

Natalie chucked the rulebook onto the coffee table. “Alright, I’ve read through the rules and it seems simple enough to get started. When we go to the dining room-”

“I read the rules last night,” Daniel interrupted, his leg bouncing as he tapped his foot. “And this morning.”

“Thank you, that’s really helpful,” Natalie said with a smile. She sat up in her chair. “It’ll really help if we get stuck. Let’s all head to the dining room. We can start by picking our characters and roles.”

“I want to be the Parrot Pirate,” Daniel said.

“To the living room!” Jamie declared as he stood up. “Grab a bowl, Daniel, take the crisps with you.”

Daniel took one of the three crisp bowls as he stood, following behind Jamie into the hallway. Natalie followed close behind. While Sarah and Naomi stayed seated.

“We should… Follow them,” Naomi suggested.

“Are you a shy person?” Sarah asked.

Naomi nearly flinched from the question. “Oh, I don’t know. Maybe a little. I wasn’t always though.” She found herself twiddling her thumbs.

Sarah reached out a hand and placed it on Naomi’s arm. “I’m not a particularly shy person,” Sarah said softly. “But people think I am, because of my voice.”

Naomi felt her skin burning beneath the other girl’s touch. Her cheeks flushed, bright red. “S-so, are you secretly some kind of party animal?”

Sarah chuckled. “No, nothing like that,” she answered. “But when I know what I want, I’m not shy about it.”

“And what do you want?” Naomi asked.

This happened last night at my sister’s home, during a small friends and family gathering.

My sister invited her good friend/workmate over. Workmate unexpectedly brought along her husband and kid.

The kid in question is quite free spirited, and the house is not designed with kids in mind. He was messing stuff up the whole night but my sister and brother-in-law were very forgiving.

Then at one point, the kid was told no for one reason or another and threw a tantrum.

The kid was looking to find ways to piss off his dad. And it was as if he knew the value of the thing, he chose to destroy one of my bro-in-law’s treasured ‘coffee table books’. He ripped some pages out and messed up the hard back cover.

My BIL looked visibly distraught but he kept his cool and was still quite forgiving.

Kid’s dad to kid: “Look at what you’ve done!!”

BIL: “It’s ok, things happen. You can pay me back slowly”

Kid’s dad looking puzzled: “mate, you’re really going to make me pay? He’s just a kid. It’s just a book”

BIL: “It’s a limited edition that’s worth a lot now (ebay: £1700). I’m only asking for a part of what I paid for it, £150 (RRP was £249). You can just pay me back when you can, no rush”

Kid’s dad: “You paid what?!? No book is worth that much. That book looks £20 tops, if I’m honest with you. You got conned, mate”

“You really shouldn’t be putting valuable things around for people to touch. What did you think was going to happen? Why even invite people over if you aren’t prepared for things like this to happen? My guests break my things all the time, you just let it go”

BIL finally had enough and things got heated. The workmate, husband and kid made an awkward exit. Sister got annoyed that my BIL caused a scene.

What is the fair thing to do here?

Does the kid’s dad have a point?
He made the point that if we were at his house and dropped a wine glass. Can he then charge us £100? “I wouldn’t, would I. I’d be the bigger person and let it go”",19,1758048789.0,AskUK,78,0.85,False

Last week I was in a local Starbucks (I like to work in coffee shops). Next to me a young female adult (I'd say more than 25 and less than 30) sat to the table next to me. We were kind of close, and she started working on her laptop. 

She gets a call and I didn't think much about it (I had my earphones on with low volume music). But she started talking louder. 
First she was begging the other person to forgive her, that she loved him, that she wanted to talk in person, that she never meant to hurt him, etc. After about 4 or 5 minutes of here begging I guessed she had problems with her boyfriend.

Then she started calling the other person dad. And then my his proper name. She kept telling him that she was sorry, etc. Ok, problems with her father. 

She tells her dad to let go of the computer and later on (don't know exactly, dispute all this I was still trying to do some work) she starts moving her arms, like stretching or something, telling the person to move like that. Now I had no idea of what was happening. That's when I noticed it was a video call. So I guess she was telling her dad how to do exercise or something. I was pretty confused. During this exercise she was praising her dad for moving correctly, something like a gym coach or something like that. 

I could barely concentrate on my work (and this call was very long) at at the end she told someone else on the call (maybe the mother?) that people with dementia are sometimes like that and they should be treated in such and such a way (like advice from a therapist talking with a caregiver). 

So at the end I guess she was trying to help her dad with dementia through a physical therapy session. Afterward thinking about it, it seemed as so many different calls... Kind of weird.

1niq5my,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1niq5my,Review: OutIn Portable Electric Vacuum Coffee Canister,"

Hey everyone! How are you?

Is anyone on the sub interested in vacuum canisters? The OutIn canister wasn't my first vacuum canister, but it was my first with truly useful technology.

It uses an automatic vacuum monitoring system.
It maintains vacuum pressure, and when the pressure decreases, the system automatically reactivates to ensure an oxygen-free environment.

I had given up on vacuum canisters a while ago, as all the ones I'd used weren't 100% effective or required manual monitoring (from time to time, I had to check the canister, open it, pump it, turn the lid, etc.). Since I like convenience, I had simply given up on that until I got this one. You simply put your coffee beans in it and go about your life, without having to check every couple of days to see if the canister is doing its job. This is my personal opinion, but I enjoy a healthy relationship with my hobby.  I want to enjoy everything related to coffee. We already have enough problems and worries in life.

It's all very simple: You put your beans in the container, put the lid on, press a button, and wait 12 seconds. That's it. Your beans are sealed.

The design is, in my opinion, very attractive, and the quality is excellent (stainless steel, rubber, and BPA-free plastic). The matte ABS exterior is beautiful and high-quality; because it's steel, you don't need to worry about extreme care when handling it (of course, you won't abuse it and drop it off your counter, but it can handle a lot. Unlike glass containers, for example—and yes, OutIn also has a glass version, but I prefer this one, due to the points raised in the text). Also, because it's steel, the beans are protected from sunlight.

The unboxing experience is great too.  It comes well protected inside the box with foam inserts and comes with a measuring spoon and cable (as well as a manual and cover letter).

According to OutIn, the battery lasts between three and six months. I've been using it for about two months and haven't needed to charge it yet.

Okay, but does it work? It works! It truly preserves the aroma and quality of the beans. I use it and the original package. I use the beans from the original package, in which the roaster sends the coffee, first, and then the beans from the OutIn canister. The result: Fresh, fragrant, and new (without that stale bean experience).

Is there anything I'd like to see improved? Yes! The capacity. Since I use 1kg of coffee per month, it would be a dream to have this exact canister, with a 1kg capacity.  That said, this canister is functional, looks nice on the countertop, preserves the beans, doesn't require physical effort like others, and doesn't cause problems (we've seen cases of other brands' canisters that, unfortunately, have caused quite a few problems recently).

I really wish OutIn would make this canister with a 1kg capacity. That would be my only reservation (it holds about 130/140g). My guess is that OutIn designed the canister with outdoor use in mind (130g of fresh beans is a great lifesaver during a short trip). Now I just have to hope they release a larger version.

Oh, I almost forgot: I read some reviews complaining about a bug in it, and... It's not a bug. If you have this canister or plan to buy it, when opening it to remove the beans, follow these steps:

Press the middle button (OutIn logo), remove the lid, and before placing the lid on the counter, press the Power button so it doesn't go off at the wrong time.  I'll leave a photo, with the step-by-step instructions, attached here.

I tried to keep the analysis quick and objective, but if you have any questions, leave a question and I'll be happy to answer.


PS: I added an unboxing video and the ""trick"" to prevent the pot lid from coming off when you are going to use it. Here: https://youtu.be/m2eWv6brrec?si=8KrsX5EGoIv5jLzj

I’ve just started a new role as a case manager in UK local government. During home visits where I’ve been shadowing colleagues – and previously when studying Social Work – the general advice I’ve always heard is not to accept refreshments when visiting service users.

I completely understand the health and safety reasons behind this, but I can’t help wondering: does it not come across as a bit rude or closed-off if we always decline? Offering a tea or coffee is such a common gesture of hospitality, and I worry that refusing every time might affect rapport.

How do you all handle this in practice? Do you stick firmly to “no refreshments,” or do you sometimes accept the offer?

My girlfriend (26F) asked me (34M) if it was “ok” for her to meet up with a male friend. At first, she described it as just getting coffee. But on the day itself, it changed, she told me they were actually meeting in another city in the evening for drinks and a jazz concert.

She’s never met this guy in person before. Their friendship has only been through occasional phone calls and sharing music online. I’ve barely even heard about him until now. I found out they call and share music today.

When she texted “is it ok?” I was honest: it sounded like a date to me, and it made me uncomfortable. I emphasized that I don’t want to control her or forbid her from seeing people, I just wanted to share my feelings and ask for awareness. She reassured me that nothing romantic is going on, but when I tried to explain why it looked like a date and why I felt uneasy, she became defensive. Later she refused to call and basically shut down communication. 

I now feel like I’m being blamed for even bringing it up, when she was the one who asked for my feelings in the first place. Instead of feeling understood, I feel alone and dismissed. I have reassured her that i trust her and her judgment, but that to an outsider this looks like a date, or at least a date setting. 

I don’t want to stop her from going out. What I want is a partner who recognizes that meeting a man you’ve never met before, at night, over drinks and a concert, could understandably *look* like a date, and that this would make their partner uncomfortable.

I asked if we could meet for a coffee, he first said fine, then said he believes it would not be good for him or me. I said it would be good for me because I would like to have a closure, he hasn’t responded.

1niq208,https://i.redd.it/n4vxgbo8nkpf1.png,How I sanitize the inside of my Stanley (and the outside) with a UV-C lid adapter,"I love my Stanley, but the inside and threads can get gross between full washes, especially after coffee or tossing it in a gym bag. I’ve been using a UV-C lid adapter that pairs with a portable UV-C device (UVCeed) to sanitize the inside of wide mouth mugs, plus a quick pass on the outside where you actually grab it (possibly even cough or sneeze on it).

Why this is useful

Gets the interior (walls, threads, and rim) that wipes can’t reach well.

Handy between washes on travel days or at the office.

UV-C is for hard, non-porous surfaces and works best after a quick rinse/wash if there’s visible gunk.

How I do it (inside)

Empty, quick rinse/wash, dry. UV-C isn’t a substitute for cleaning off residue.

Seat the lid adapter on the mug. It holds the UVCeed device at the right angle/distance.

UVCeed has app-guided dosing so just open the app, push a button and wait for the timer to complete (30 seconds).

Remove the adapter off when done.

Then the outside (shown in the pic)

Aim the UV-C at handle, grip points, lid exterior, rim, and threads.

Safety / notes

Best on hard, non-porous surfaces (stainless, many plastics). Fabric/porous materials are less responsive.

UV-C complements normal washing; it doesn’t replace soap + hot water.


FAQ

Will this fit my mug? Works with many wide mouth stainless travel mugs (Stanley, YETI, Hydro Flask style). Check your opening and adapter fit before buying.

Taste/smell? None from UV-C; it’s light, not a chemical.

Why not just wipes? Wipes are fine; UV-C lets you hit threads/rim/interior quickly without chemicals, especially when traveling.

If anyone’s tried other lid adapters or has fit notes for different sizes, drop them below, collective fit data helps a ton.",1,1758048374.0,UVCeed,0,1.0,False
1niq1cb,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1niq1cb/lelit_elizabeth_df64_or_something_else_and_should/,Lelit Elizabeth + DF64 or something else and should I actually spend my budget? [1600€],"I'm in Germany. I've had a Delonghi Dedica for six years now, used it daily to make anywhere from two to six lattes based on *single* shots of espresso. So double shot split in two. I make two in the morning for me and my wife. And currently two to three double shots (straight or as Americano for my wife) throughout the day. We've been quite happy with it and supermarket pre ground beans aimed more at filter coffee. But it's way past its lifetime and I've talked myself into wanting more.

For some more context, before kids and work took over all my time, I was really into pour over. Had (still have, somewhere) a bodum grinder for it. If I'm not mixing it with milk, I'm really into light roasts, floral and fruity notes. But for my milk drink it needs to be more chocolatey.

I don't need a water spout. I have an electric kettle. I don't mind a little additional warm up time for steam and I don't think pulling shots and steaming milk at the same time is worth a whole lot of money. Long ass warm up time are right out though, so no E61 group head and I don't see the point of hx machines. I can't figure out the combo of ""I want to steam milk and pull shots at the and time for efficiency"" and ""I'm happy to wait 30 plus minutes for my machine to warm up"" outside of coffee shops. And doesn't that interfere with precisely measuring your shot?

On the other hand there are two different mods that give you all kinds of control on a single boiler but no company offers something comparable in that price range. Why? What am I missing?

Anyway, I think I'd be quite happy with anything ranging from a Lelit Anna 2 (500€) and a DF54 (255€) to a Lelit Elizabeth (1050€) and a DF64 (420€). As I said, I don't think I care much for DB but I'm into light roasts and the preinfusion functionalities speak to me. I was looking at the Profitec Go but it's only 100€ less than the Elizabeth. Another consideration is that my wife won't want to deal with the workflow of the Anna.

About the grinders. The properties of flat burrs speak to me. I like clear cups. I'll also usually have two roasts on hand. A medium dark one for the milk drinks and my wife. And a lighter one for myself. So I'll need to change the grind settings frequently. And flexing into pour over would be nice. That also ties into the functions of the Elizabeth, where I understand I can program the two buttons differently.

It's likely I suffer from ADHD but I've yet to get diagnosed for it. I will typically get around 4 to 5 hours of sleep each night and have an hour long commute through busy city traffic to get to work each morning so that takes a lot out of you plus I always skip breakfast and never get coffee in the mornings. The meetings are usually about boring stuff and my boss spent two thirds of it wasting everybodys time arguing with another employee about the correct way to log our data. He was arguing about a fucking formality. I don't see why I even need to go to these things it's all above my pay grade as I'm just a base level employee. Another infuriating part is that two or three other eployees kept randomly checking their phones throughout the meeting *when I didn't even bring mine* so why am I the only fucking problem again?! I do a lot for this company so why does it matter that I'm not as good in social settings? Why does that somehow matter more than the actualy quantity of work I'm able to get done each day?

1nipuxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1nipuxt/how_to_balance_between_self_improvement_and/,How to balance between self improvement and social events for dating?,"22M. I currently have about 6 free evenings a week that I can do social events. My goal is to find a Christian wife.

Everyone says to continue to self improve but I’ve  already made senior analyst and I make $100k a year. I’m not overweight and I’m 6’5” so I think my issue is a sourcing/approaching. I’d like to find a woman that is educated like myself, Christian, and has a full time job. I can try and push to get to $125k in 2 years and push for a promotion… but that’s a slow push. I’d like to get to $200k before I’m 30 though so that’s a focus I have to plan out. 

I can go to sports events, worship and prayer events, run clubs. But this kinda burns me out because I have a full time job too. I really want to just grind it out and approach 100 women and finally get a gf I like. I don’t really care how bold I have to be, I’m just determined to make it happen at this point. After church, coffee shops, heck on the street… I’m tired of waiting so I’m going to do something about it. 

I also want to work more on self improvement - the gym, additional education stuff for my career, becoming the best but I find I hate most of the social stuff because it’s an absurd waste of time. I’m most happy when I’m working out, at the bar with my guy friends, at Bible study, house parties, etc. Yet I feel like I’m not doing enough for a relationship.

How do I balance self improvement and social events for dating so I can be successful?",1,1758047949.0,TrueChristian,4,1.0,False
1nipu9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassF/comments/1nipu9p/part_101/,Part 101,"**James**

The disguise itched until I remembered to breathe through it. Old coat, gray hair, a stoop learned in an afternoon the beggar I needed to be. The Zone smells like iron and rot; my rags soaked that smell up and pretended to belong. To them I was a ghost with pockets. To me, it was camouflage.

Walking those streets made my teeth grind. Children picking through garbage. Men sleeping on drywall like it was a bed of nails. Women bargaining for soup as if scraps were gold. The city had become a series of small deaths. I kept my head down and let my false shame blot the world out. My father’s voice hummed behind every footstep: weeds, not citizens. It was convenient thinking. It made cruelty tidy.

When I knocked at Antônio’s door, my knuckles left a wet print from scum and cold. He opened it quick  neat, alert. “Ah, vovô. I thought you’d stopped coming. Come in.”

Inside the room the air was softer. Sweat, coffee, leather; a small, human smell that didn’t fight with the smoke outside. Leo stepped forward from shadow raw, sleepy, honest in the way only someone who’d just woken could be. Good. He trusted feelings that hadn’t yet been hardened.

I dropped the mask then and let the trick finish itself. Wrinkles smoothed. The hunched back straightened. My voice found the warmth I’d practiced. He went to me without suspicion; a son who finds his father as if by right.

“Father.” The word was small and bright and dangerous.

Antônio watched us both with that half-curious edge  the man who always measures what a moment might cost. “So you change now?” he said. “How did you get that new power, James?”

The truth was a slab of ice I could not hand them. Sônia’s hollowed face on a table of wires. Almair’s machines carving gifts from people. I had been grafted, given a piece of someone else. None of that was for this room.

I chose a lie with the right bones of truth inside. “It’s borrowed,” I said. “The Association keeps certain gifts in places. I was lent this one. It used to belong to Sônia — the Lotus — but it’s been amplified. I carry a shard for this mission.”

Leo blinked. “So it’s temporary.”

“Exactly.” I let relief show like a smile. “A loan, not blood.”

Antônio laughed. “A fine trick. I’d like to vanish sometimes.”

Leo’s answer was softer, almost a dream. “I’d rather walk as anyone. No one would look twice.”

Antônio grinned. “Then stay with James today. I’ll tell Ivo you’re sick.” He left the house with the easy authority of a man who gives orders and is obeyed.

When the door shut the room shrank. Just the two of us. My disguise had come off, but the real mask  the one Almair stamped into my chest  stayed on. Leo looked at me like a boy who’d found an anchor. He thought he had a father. What he had was a lever.

Morning light cut across the table. He rubbed his eyes and asked, quietly, “How are the days, father?”

I chose a voice that sounded older than my skin, soft like advice. “They go on. You wake up and you go on. That’s what this life asks.”

He admitted his hurt. “I’m still sad. Miguel and Victor… they were my friends.”

Good. Grief makes men softer at the places you want them to bend. I leaned in, folded my hands the way a teacher folds them when the lesson matters. “In our line,” I told him, “men die. A lot. The pain doesn’t break you if you convert it. You turn it into fuel.”

He watched me, searching for permission to feel. “But so many innocent people mothers, children—”

“Innocent,” I repeated, tasting the word like iron. “If those ‘innocents’ knew who you were, Leo, they would tear you apart. The city is a theater; people clap at the right story and stone the wrong face. Your name makes you soft. It makes you a target.”

He bristled. “The Association destroyed them without needing a surname.”

A small, satisfied laugh slipped out. He was listening in the way I wanted. “Convenient, isn’t it? But convenient isn’t accidental. In Sector 12 we did what we had to do. We were looking for you. Everything else was brushfire to clear the road.”

His face closed like a door. “You mean… for me?”

“Yes,” I said, and I let the lie warm between us. “Did we err? Perhaps. Did we go too far? Maybe. But the world is rotten. To change it, sometimes you break what holds it together. For a greater good, ugliness is sometimes necessary.”

The silence that followed felt like a net drawing taut. Then I pushed once more, gentler this time: “Did you see them last night? How they tore each other like beasts? They don’t need us to destroy themselves. That is why we act. Mercy without calculation is dying slowly.”

He looked away, and that small, wounded look fit into place exactly where I’d wanted it. He nodded. “I… I understand.”

Good. He will say that line until it becomes his. I rose, patted his shoulder with practiced warmth, and left the room. Outside, the street smelled of ash and small graves. Inside, I polished my report in my head: Leo at my side, Almair placated, usefulness restored.

I am, once more, what I was meant to be: a tool worth keeping.

***

**Leo**

Morning light spills through the cracked blinds, pale and weak, like even the sun doesn’t dare touch the Red Zone. I sit across from him—my father, or at least the man who wears that title. He’s dressed as an old beggar, but the illusion doesn’t fool me. The moment the door shut behind us, his face softened into something else. Something calculated.

At first, I wanted to believe him. I always do. But every word he speaks carries a weight too polished, too rehearsed. Like he’s laying bricks for a road he doesn’t plan to walk.

He tells me grief is normal. That heroes bleed, that we lose friends, and that pain should become fuel. His voice is steady, smooth, almost comforting. But it doesn’t land. It doesn’t feel like comfort it feels like manipulation.

Because I’m still hearing the screams. I’m still seeing the bodies. Miguel. Victor. Kids. Mothers. And when I tell him that when I say good people died—his eyes sharpen, and I see it. The contempt. He doesn’t even hide it well.

“Good people?” he repeats, almost laughing. Then he tells me those same people would tear me apart if they knew my last name. Bardos.

My blood runs hot. I want to spit in his face, but I hold it. I just answer, “The Association tore them apart without needing a single surname.”

That makes him smirk. A smirk I’ve seen before. Cold. Cruel. And then he says it. That they did it all for me. That Sector 12 burned because they were searching for me.

My stomach turns. Convenient. Too convenient. To blame that slaughter on me is almost obscene. But part of me wonders—is that really what they tell themselves? That massacres are justified because they chase ghosts of bloodlines?

I stare at him, waiting for a hint of honesty. He offers something that almost sounds like it: “Maybe we erred. Maybe we went too far. But the world is rotten. To fix it, some pieces must break.”

His words slide into me like knives wrapped in honey. They sound like reason, but they drip with rot. I can feel it. The falseness. The agenda behind every syllable. He doesn’t care about me—he cares about what I can become for him, for Almair, for the machine that feeds on blood.

And yet, in the same breath, I hear myself thinking: What do I care about?

Because I can’t keep floating between two fires. I’ve seen Gabe burn alive and keep fighting. I’ve seen Danny spill his own veins to protect strangers. I’ve seen Zenos, broken and guilty, still carrying everyone on his shoulders. And now I see James my father smiling through lies, excusing slaughter, calling people animals.

He says they kill each other without needing help. That they’re not even worth saving.

And I think: maybe that’s the difference. Maybe I don’t care about worth. Maybe saving them is what makes it worth it.

His hand on my shoulder is heavy, practiced, fake. He tells me to rest. That tomorrow will demand my strength.

But as he leaves, my decision settles like a stone in my chest.

I don’t want to be his tool. I don’t want to be Almair’s weapon.

I want to be something else.

I don’t know if I can forgive myself, or them, or the world. But I know this: the path James offers is poison, and if I drink it, I’ll never come back.

So I’ll choose. Not today, not out loud but soon.

Because I’m done being dragged by other people’s lies.

The time has come to decide what kind of man I will be.

***

When the door closed behind him, silence filled the room like water in a sinking ship. I could still feel the weight of his hand on my shoulder, cold and practiced, a father’s touch without a father’s love.

I sat there, staring at nothing, and my mind began to unfold.

Antonio. Pietro. Their names rose first. Men who walked like they knew exactly where they were going. Solid. Sharp. Firm. I don’t agree with everything they are, everything they’ve chosen, but gods I admire them. They carry themselves with weight. They are strong not just in their fists but in their convictions.

And me? I’ve been drifting, pulled by tides I never chose. A pawn between Almair’s cage and Gabe’s fire. I want to stand like they do. Decide. Be more than the boy everyone is trying to shape.

My thoughts turned to Sector 15. To what Pietro showed me. The ruins, the broken bodies, the cries clawing out of stone. And then—Gabe’s voice, raw and thunderous, cutting through the smoke. A speech filled with pain and honor in equal measure. It wasn’t politics. It wasn’t performance. It was truth. And I felt it in my bones.

Zenos was there too. He is real. And the others—Danny, Sofia, Giulia, Samue. I felt something standing near them. A current that hummed in my chest. Real. Honest. The same feeling I once had in Class F, when we were students and Zenos was not just a leader but a guide. That was true. That was who I was.

And no matter how badly I wanted a father—no matter how much I wanted James to look at me and see a son, not a tool—I couldn’t lie to myself anymore. Blood doesn’t decide truth. The heart does.

Pietro… Pietro could be part of this. I know it. He’s not blind. He hates corruption, hates the Association as much as I do. He could fight with us. With Zenos. With Gabe. He could be the bridge.

But Antonio… the thought stabs deep. Antonio is more than a comrade. He’s my friend. My brother in all but blood. He’s taught me, pushed me, protected me. Facing him as an enemy it feels unbearable. My chest tightens even thinking it. But maybe… maybe he could be convinced too. Antonio has a heart, buried under his rage. He could be swayed.

I close my eyes and breathe.

The truth presses heavy and sharp inside me: I know where I belong. I know what is real. The fight for freedom. The fight against the Association’s chains. With Gabe. With Zenos. With the broken, the burning, the ones still stubborn enough to dream of something better.

I am not just Almair’s grandson. I am not just James’s son. I am not a name to be carried like a curse.

I am Leo.

And I will not deny what I feel any longer.

***

**Pietro**

The smell of strong coffee and stale bread pulled me back into the moment. I was at Coquinho’s place, that little restaurant that felt more like the tired heart of the Zone than a business. The walls were cracked, the tables wobbled, but there was warmth in every corner. A place that endured. Amelie sat beside me, stirring her cup without drinking, her mind clearly somewhere else.

Coquinho came over with a rag on his shoulder, the same blunt tone as always.
“Tell me something, Pietro… was it you mixed up in that mess in Sector 15?”

I met his eyes.
“No, Coquinho. Not me. But I lost friends there.” The words came out flat, heavy.

He let out a long breath, nodding slowly. “Sometimes, bad things clear the ground for better. Hard to say it that way, but last night burned out the last of the gangs. And now? Gabe’s the one standing. The people are with him. He’s calling anyone who wants to step up  calls them Red Heroes. Says he wants men and women who’ll stand for the Zone.”

The words hit me like fire in the lungs. Red Hero. For once, it didn’t sound like a title for glory, but for purpose.
“That’s what I want,” I said, and I surprised even myself with how fast the truth came out.

Coquinho studied me with those eyes that see more than they say. “Knew it. You’ve got that look.” Then he turned to Amelie, half-grinning. “And you, young lady? Going to put your name in too?”

She tilted her head, hesitant. “Maybe. I’ll think about it first.”

“Fair enough,” Coquinho said. “It’ll be good to see who shows up. Now  enough talk. I’ve got tables waiting.” He walked off, already barking at someone in the back.

As soon as he was gone, Amelie turned on me, her voice sharp. “How can you just say you’ll go without even telling Antonio first? How can you know where Gabe is and not warn him?”

I raised my hands, trying to calm her. “Easy. Who said I won’t talk to Antonio? I will. But think, Amelie. If Gabe’s surrounded by a crowd that adores him, do you really think it’s smart to storm in trying to kill him? That would be suicide. And look at what Coquinho said — people are lining up to join him. To call themselves Red Heroes. If Antonio’s smart, he’ll want me there.”

She crossed her arms, eyes still burning. “Maybe. But it’s dangerous. We already lost two of ours yesterday.”

I leaned closer, lowering my voice. “We won’t attack. We won’t defend. We’ll just be what we are here: two people who belong to this place, two workers from Coquinho’s. People who love the Red Zone, not Capas Bronze of the Association. That’s how we walk into that meeting.”

Her gaze softened a little, but I could still feel the doubt in her silence. I smiled anyway.
“Trust me, Amelie. This time, it’ll work.”

***

After Coquinho walked off, I stayed quiet, my hands wrapped around the chipped cup. The coffee was lukewarm, bitter as ash, but it grounded me. Amelie still watched me, suspicion in her eyes, but my mind had already drifted past her words.

Red Hero. The title rolled in my head like a coin. Was it just a trick to gather bodies? Or was there something real behind it? Gabe wasn’t just another gang boss, that much was clear. He was different. The way Coquinho spoke about him, the way the Zone seemed to bend toward him now… that wasn’t fear alone. That was belief.

And belief is rarer than power.

I wanted to see him with my own eyes. To hear what he stood for when the smoke settled and the knives were lowered. Was it justice he chased? Or just another crown carved out of corpses? My gut told me there was more. His name carried stories of Sector 12, of blood and betrayal  but the man himself… I needed to measure him. To weigh his words against my own sense of right.

Because I do have one, even if the Association pretends otherwise.

And then there was Zenos. The ghost teacher, the rebel professor. No one had ever stood against the Association like he had, not in my lifetime. No politician, no soldier, no hero in uniform. He and his allies had carved cracks in the walls everyone thought unbreakable. That intrigued me more than I liked to admit. I wanted to know what gave him that fire — and what kind of people still followed him into hell.

Maybe it was dangerous curiosity. Maybe it was something more.

But one truth sat heavy in my chest: I couldn’t ignore this. Not Gabe, not Zenos, not the way the Zone was shifting under their hands. If there was a cause worth believing in, worth bleeding for, it would show itself there, not in the polished halls of the Association.

I leaned back in my chair, watching Amelie’s frown soften as she finally sipped her coffee. She didn’t understand yet. Maybe I didn’t either.

But I knew this much  I wasn’t going to miss the chance to stand in that room, to listen, to see if the future of the Zone was being born in Gabe’s words.

And if it was… I needed to decide whether I’d stand against it or with it.

The reason I need that so badly right now is that I used to be way better at keeping house but shiny new trauma from a few years ago changed that, and all my old ways of managing just dont work anymore. 

I'm very slowly relearning how to do all this stuff consistently, and being poor doesn't super help, but it is what it is. 

My current favorite ADHD cleaning method is to unload or load up as many dishes as I can for the dishwasher while my food is cooking, and I definitely have go-to youtubers to listen who while I do this. Usually a crime channel 😂

When it comes to picking up the floor, after removing most of the trash or loose clothes, I just sweep everything else up into a big pile and pick out the stuff that doesn't need to be tossed, like pens, cat toys, etc. Ive found a LOT of little stuff I thought was totally lost forever while doing this. 

I try to do something everyday that will improve my environment, but sometimes I just can't manage to finish any task, and that's okay. Halfway unloading the dishes is okay. So is sweeping the floors but not mopping them even if they need it. It's fine if I only clear the trash away from my coffee table because that means there's less trash, even if there's lots of unnecessary stuff on the table still. Its taking things one at a time, not all at once, that has been helping me with consistency. :)

Ive also very recently taken great pleasure in upcycling stuff so I have less actual trash and more things I can use for other stuff - especially if I can do something creative with it. 

What do you guys do, especially for people who also lost the ability to keep house post trauma? ",1,1758047618.0,adhdwomen,7,1.0,False

1nipm4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nipm4g/my_first_year_dating_as_a_26_year_old_woman/,My first year dating as a 26 year old woman,"I've never been one that was interested in romance. When I was younger, I was concerned about hitting such milestones as it was something that my family and friends talked about frequently, but it had never been in my heart to want to be with someone physically or emotionally. I love platonic friendship! I know and have been told that I'm attractive and have been pursued, but I never wanted it to go any further. This has caused me to lose a lot of male friends, unfortunately. After my friend Sara went through a pretty rough break up I promised her that I would enter the dating field with her to support her future pursuit, but I didn't think she would take it seriously.

Enter Date 1, Grant (28M). Upon Sara moving back in town, she invited me to a singles night where I would serve as her wing woman. Once getting there, Sara had an unfortunate case of diarrhea leading to me being alone on the floor. I was quickly approached by Grant. We shared the same music interests and were really interested in the arts. Conversation was good, but once again I felt nothing. He asked me out and I said yes as at that time Sam had finally come back and squeezed my arm upon hearing the ask. I also am a people pleaser. The date was nice and he was a great conversationalist, but felt that he wanted to trauma bond and was putting on a show in a way. He also was sort of a yes man too. We both mutually decided to stay friends, which has been great!

Enter Date 2, Alex (27M). Months later my friends and I had a pretty rough night in which they discussed their dating lives. I love supporting them and giving advice, but I always tell them to take my points with a grain of salt given my lack of interest and experience in the dating sphere. A part of me felt detached in a way so I decided to download Hinge to really see how bad the field was. It was decent. It was human. No one is perfect. I was asked out immediately by Alex to go get ice cream. He was interesting and I could tell was mostly physically attracted to me. He didn't ask a lot of questions, similar to Grant actually, and said that my interests were different and he's never interacted with anyone like me before. Said interests were going to coffee shops, reading books, and volunteering. I know, very basic activities, which is why I was a bit annoyed. He also never went 5 minutes without applying lip balm lol. He was very adamant about wanting nothing to do with making friends and was there for romance which I respected. After telling him I wasn't interested the next day, I was blocked.

Enter Date 3, Simon (26M), aka the awakening I think. Before even going on the date with Alex, I met Simon in person around my birthday. I really liked his outfit and complimented him to which he did the same. I also noticed him at a bar that I frequent. He actually did match with me on Hinge, but I deleted my account maybe three days after initially downloading it as I grew bored. After going to Grant's art show, my friend's and I ended up at the same bar again where I saw my older brother and a few people that attended an event I hosted the day before. During the conversation, Simon asked to squeeze by and upon locking eyes I became a bit awkward as I kind of technically ghosted him even though we never exchanged words on the app. Turns out he's actually friends with my brother and he introduced the both of us even though we technically knew each other already. My friends noticed how he was staring at me for the rest of the night but never approached only asking if the cake I had gotten was any good before I left. After getting home, I noticed that he followed me on IG. I posted a couple pics on my story from the night that he liked. I replied saying that it was nice finally meeting him and asked how the cake was. He said he didn't get a chance to get said cake and wanted to make up for it by taking me out for cheesecake. I said yes.

It was at a really fancy restaurant that I had been wanting to go to for awhile. The ambiance was great and the food was pretty good as well. Our conversation was natural and easy. It almost felt like I was talking to myself. I felt myself getting aroused at some point even though there was nothing sexual about our interaction. The bartenders were hovering around us sharing soft smiles and when he took a bathroom break the girls gave me a thumbs up which was nice. We were leaving and the host actually stopped us to compliment how we looked together which was sweet. He was very articulate, poetic, passionate about his craft, emotionally aware, puts his words into action, asked a lot of questions, and never interrupted me when I was speaking. He walked me to my car, confessing how stunning he found me and that he was completely in awe of me. I found myself blushing. I couldn't sleep that night. The next morning he expressed how natural and easy the night felt and sent me a very lovely song. I listened to it on repeat. I truly did not expect to like him this fast, but here we are. I don't exactly know how to navigate this feeling as it is genuinely so new to me. We didn't talk/text yesterday as it was the start of the work week. I had a really busy day and I'm sure he did as well. My friends are more excited than me it seems and are a bit upset he hasn't set up a second date yet despite saying he wants to see me again.

So sorry for the length but wanted to share.

**TL;DR:** I’ve never really been interested in romance and mostly value platonic friendships, though I’ve been pursued before. I only started dating to support a friend after her breakup. Date 1 (Grant, 28M) was nice but felt forced; we agreed to stay friends. Date 2 (Alex, 27M) was more physical attraction but no depth, and he blocked me when I said I wasn’t interested. Date 3 (Simon, 26M) felt completely different; natural conversation, mutual attraction, genuine connection. I wasn’t expecting to like him this quickly, but I do, and it’s new/overwhelming for me. My friends are hyped, but I’m still figuring out how to navigate it.",3,1758047414.0,dating_advice,3,0.81,False

The kind of mess where you're not sure if the chair in the corner is for sitting anymore. The tipping point was when I found a half-full coffee mug behind my monitor. It had developed its own little mold civilisation.

What really works for me is building a system so simple that even your brain on power-saving mode can't escape it.

So here are the traps I set for it every day. It's not a revolution, but it changed everything for me.

1. The Atomic 2-Minute Rule. If a task takes less than two minutes, I'm not allowed to put it off. I just do it, period. Putting my bowl in the dishwasher right after eating. Putting my shoes in the closet when I get home. Answering that simple email. It sounds like nothing, but it eliminates 90% of the small messes that pile up and end up paralyzing you.
2. The ""Just One Thing"" a Day. Every morning, I choose ONE important thing I absolutly have to do that day. Not a to-do list with 20 items. Just one. It could be ""start a load of laundry"" or ""spend 15 minutes on that awful work project."" Once it's done, the day is already a win. Everything else is a bonus. It takes off a crazy amount of pressure.
3. The Big Evening ""Reset"". Every evening, before I chill out, I set a 10-minute timer. During those 10 minutes, I put away as many things as I can in their place. The coffee table, the papers lying around, the mugs. My place is never perfect, but it's never a disaster zone anymore. The next mornig, I wake up in a clean environment, and that changes everything for your mindset.
4. The Environment Trap. I make good habits easy and bad habits hard. I lay out my gym clothes the night before and put them in plain sight. On the other hand, cookies and chips are stored on the highest shelf of a cupboard, behind other stuff. Being too lazy to grab a stool has saved me from a lot of snacking. Same for my phone, at night it charges across the room, not next to my bed.
5. The ""Accountabilty Budy"" (the nice version). I have a friend I send a simple text to when I have to do something I'm dreading. ""Hey, I'm going to the gym tonight."" That's it. Just knowing that someone else is aware creates a little positive social pressure. I don't want to be the guy who says he's going to do stuff and never does.

That's it. I didn't have some mystical revelation. I just stopped waiting to feel like it. I set up dumb little systems that work for me, no matter how I feel.",16,1758047351.0,getdisciplined,3,0.9,False

1nipisj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1nipisj/how_to_handle_the_negativity/,How to handle the negativity,"Six weeks ago, my 87 year old father broke his neck. We have always had a very complicated relationship. He has a lot of personal trauma that he has never worked through and it has consistently come between us. Our cycle has always been that I try to express care and he pushes me away, maybe as some sort of twisted test of devotion. He also seems to think all of the work of a relationship should fall on me and it doesn't really matter if he hurts my feelings; never an acknowledgement or apology.

Despite our strained relationship, after his injury, my husband and I invited him to stay with us while he recovers. I have been taking care of him, cooking his favorite meals, bringing him coffees, sitting with him, taking care of his medical and hygienic needs, outfitting a comfortable space for him with everything he needs, etc. I even converted my art studio into an apartment for him and told him he could stay as long as he wants. Despite all of my best efforts, he has made comments multiple times about not feeling welcome, being a burden, wanting to go back to his own home asap even though it is unsafe, and yelling at me to leave him alone. 

Two weeks ago, my mother died (my mother and father were never a couple during my life). She was in a nursing home, but for the past couple of years, I have also been her main support system (another very complicated, abusive relationship that I tried my best to continually put aside to be a good, loving daughter). I have now also had to work through my grief and all of the arrangements for her funeral/estate. During this time, I have received very little sympathy from him. Needless to say, it has been difficult.

The day after picking up my mother's belongings and her cremains, my father made another rude comment about not feeling welcome and wanting to leave asap. I'm not sure what to do. I can recognize that he is lashing out because he is feeling bad about his own situation and his deep-seated traumas, but that doesn't make it any easier to hear when I am bending over backward to take good care of him despite everything else going on. Close family friends tell me I basically need to suck it up and be the bigger person, but damn am I tired of that. I'm finding it very difficult to find the will to continue waiting on him. Why make such an effort to be so welcoming when he can't see it? I don't know what to do. I would love to hear any insight/advice you all have. Thanks",1,1758047207.0,CaregiverSupport,0,1.0,False

For the last 2 years I have a boyfriend and we spend a lot of our days together, if not with him I meet friends out. Before that we used to go out with mom too, for shopping and stuff and while we were out we would have a coffee together etc. Sometimes she asks me to go out and suggests doing something but most of the time I always got smth already planned. For 2 years I never thought like this but now I kinda feel guilty, whenever we had a fight she always said she didn’t want me home, so just after I leave work I make a plan and spend at home as little time as possible. Even when I do accept to go out with her she tries to make me change my clothes and says I have no taste in fashion and she can’t be seen with me dressed like that lol. So just to not get into any arguments and fights avoiding her became something natural to me now, even when I feel tired and want to rest I just make a plan and leave home.

Jinglejingle Late Night, Jinglejingle Late night.

So please follow the rule of the night-time, I got a lot of people that really does not read that part specifically and reach out while our time does not match or people that say they do, but for some reason does not have the time in the end (supposedly, yeah bunch of liars) same reason I didn't answer some request at all, I can do from time to time other hours in the day, but mainly nights for reasons, also no groups I already have 1 where I can get as much anymore because of time and one small with good friends of the night-time, but often we don't share the same idea of some games and so I come here and other places to seek.

To the point
I'm a loser 😀
I play a lot of games, gaming since 2002, but if we are talking about consistency at the moment:
Nightreing (getting destroyed in Depth of the night).
Gunfire reborn, really want anyone to play, it's not amazing, but it's fun.
Deadlock, my god i got hooked by it and even more by Bebop, Lash was right.
We can do 7 Days to die, No man sky (just got back into it), Valheim, V Rising ( started it for a few hours but want to play it coop honestly), if you want a competitive one then more so Rivals, left OW a while now, grounded 1 and 2, palworld, lord of the fallen and honestly more, even into friend-slops or whatever you want to call it, i also am a big fan of actuall horror game and survival horror is by far my favorite genre aside from dark fantasy, open to a lot of games and a lot of indies that you may want to try (lost castle 1/2, across the obelisk, whisper mountain outbreak, blightbound, more) technically a lot of games, like a whole lot. (Want a valheim duo as well 🥹)

About me:
Introvert, Combined ADHD, BPD type 2, I can handle a extrovert if they can handle my switch from high to low energy, I like to be silly and serious at the same time and also like deep conversations when it happens or just silence when we just enjoy the time gaming and helping each other, im possibly on the spectrum wich would make a lot of sense, needs confirmation, you can be acting extremely goofy or as you like, we enjoy it, no discrimination, anyone is welcome.
I like Hard Rock, metal, Indies, mostly gaming OSTs, orchestra, some pop, some ambient and open to a lot you want to share too.
I would like to start going again to cons and try cosplay for the first time next year.
I'm an odd person honestly, can't help it, but hey, honesty.
Huge coffee enjoyer and starter connoisseur.
I enjoy games showcases and can't wait to see the bloodbath in this game awards at december.
Late night is my preference because I enjoy it, don't want to do it all the time of course, but as of now it has become almost full time since job got in the way, even if it changes back i still would do late night sessions, but not the entire week lol.
Please only reach out if you follow those terms, Late Night, full fledged gamer, I want to know someone that religiously follow games as I do, like a culture thingy.
Ask anything or whatever, happy hunting and thanks for reading.

You walk into that sandwich shop. The one with the neighborhood feel. The place where the manager knows your order. You think you're supporting local business.

You're wrong.

Private equity owns your lunch. They bought it while you weren't looking. Now they're counting every penny that crosses your lips.

The numbers tell the story. One firm, Roark Capital, owns 21 restaurant chains¹. Their properties generated $52.2 billion in system sales last year². That's more revenue than McDonald's domestic business². You've eaten at their places. Subway. Arby's. Dunkin'. Buffalo Wild Wings. Jimmy John's. Sonic. Auntie Anne's. Cinnabon. Baskin-Robbins. Carl's Jr. Hardee's^(3).

Roark employs almost one million workers^(4), slinging your coffee, building your sandwich, taking your order. They didn't build these brands. They bought them. Stripped them down. Rebuilt them to generate cash. The American Dream.

Here's what private equity does to restaurants. They acquire the chain. Load it with debt. Extract management fees. Cut labor costs. Squeeze suppliers. Raise prices. Then they sell it to the next buyer or take it public. The whole process takes three to seven years. Long enough to optimize every dollar of profit. Short enough to avoid the consequences.

Roark’s workers pay the price. Their restaurants owe workers more than $1.5 million in back wages at Dunkin' alone since 2010^(4). That's just what the Department of Labor caught. Wage theft investigations hit their brands more than 450 times over the same period^(4). Jimmy John's, Sonic, Buffalo Wild Wings, Arby's, Hardee's, and Carl's Jr. All repeat offenders. All owned by the same firm.

The workers make $10 to $12 per hour^(4). Many qualify for food stamps and Medicaid^(4). Your tax dollars subsidize their poverty wages while private equity partners cash out millions. This isn't an accident. This is the business model. The American Dream.

Seattle knows this story. MOD Pizza started here in 2008. Scott and Ally Svenson built it from one location to 500. They took $160 million from private equity in 2019^(5). The firm promised to help them reach 1,000 locations. Instead, MOD closed 44 stores and was sold to Elite Restaurant Group in 2024^(5). Elite specializes in ""financially troubled restaurant brands^(5). That's private equity speak for cleaning up the mess.

Portland felt it too. Sortis Holdings bought beloved local spots during the pandemic^(6). Ava Gene's. Bamboo Sushi. Sizzle Pie. Rudy's Barbershop. The firm promised to ""capitalize on the stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic^(6)"". Chairman Paul Brenneke called Sortis a ""white knight^(6)"". Now they face evictions and lawsuits while 1,200 employees wonder about their jobs¹⁶. Company shares trade at $0.0002 each^(6). The American Dream.

The bankruptcy wave is building. Private equity-backed companies filed 110 bankruptcies in 2024. That's a 15% increase from the previous year^(7). Restaurant chains hit especially hard. Red Lobster. TGI Fridays. Rubio's. MOD Pizza. All casualties of financial engineering over operational excellence.

Blackstone isn't slowing down. They dropped $8 billion on Jersey Mike's last month^(8). These aren't investments in restaurant innovation. They're bets on financial optimization. Extract value. Load debt. Repeat.

The biggest deals tell the story. Roark paid $11.3 billion for Dunkin' in 2020^(9). Another $9.6 billion for Subway in 2023^(10). Just acquired Dave's Hot Chicken for $1 billion this year^(10). That money didn't improve your dining experience. It improved investor returns.

You want to fight back? Start paying attention to ownership. That ""local"" chain expanding into new markets overnight? Private equity money fuels that growth. The sudden menu price increases? Margin optimization. The understaffed dining room? Labor cost reduction.

Research before you eat. Most private equity ownership hides behind holding company names. Inspire Brands owns Arby's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Sonic, and Dunkin'^(11). GoTo Foods controls Auntie Anne's, Cinnabon, Carvel, and McAlister's Deli^(12). Both roll up under Roark Capital. One firm. Multiple brands. Same profit motive. The American Dream.

Support actual independent restaurants. The owner works the floor. The profits stay local. The decisions get made by people who live in your community. These places struggle against private equity's pricing power. They need your business more than corporate chains need your loyalty.

Ask questions. Where does this restaurant's profit go? Who makes the operational decisions? How do they treat workers? Real local businesses welcome these conversations. Corporate chains are unsure how to answer them.

The restaurant industry consolidation continues. Eddie V’s, LongHorn Steakhouse, Ruth’s Chris Steak House, The Capital Grille, Olive Garden, Yard House, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Chuy’s, Seasons 52, and Bahama Breeze are all owned by Darden Restaurants. Fewer owners control more restaurants. Your choices shrink while their profits grow. The solution isn't regulation. It's awareness. Know who owns your food. Choose accordingly.

Private equity firms bet you won't notice the difference between authentic local restaurants and corporate chains. They're counting on convenience overriding your values. They've made this bet a million times before.

Time to prove them wrong.

1nipayj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1nipayj/assess_the_soft_scrub_cleanser_for_kitchens_and/,Assess the Soft Scrub Cleanser for Kitchens and Bathrooms Worth It,"Testing out the Henkel 00023400021932 Soft Scrub Cleanser has been an interesting experience. As someone who regularly deals with the realities of stubborn kitchen and bathroom messes, having a reliable cleaning product is non-negotiable. From the moment I tested this advanced formula with Oxi scrubbers, I realized this cleanser promised more than the average bottle of cleaner. It’s the kind of product that makes you wonder how you managed without it, though it does present a few quirks that potential users might want to consider.

**Ease of Use and Versatility**  
Using this multi-purpose cleanser couldn’t be easier, and its broad application certainly caught my attention. Designed for both kitchen and bathroom surfaces, it worked perfectly on my counters, sinks, stovetop, and even the shower tiles. A quick shake of the bottle, a small squeeze of the product directly onto a damp cloth or the surface, and a few circular motions were enough to handle most messes. What impressed me most was its ability to tackle a diverse range of stains, from coffee spills on my kitchen counter to hard water marks in the bathroom sink. And trust me, the faint but pleasant scent made cleaning slightly less annoying for someone who usually avoids scrubbing on busy weekends.

**Performance on Stains**  
This cleaner wasn’t joking about its stain-busting capabilities. I deliberately tried it on wine and tea stains that had been on my countertop longer than I’d care to admit. To my surprise, the Oxi particles activated almost instantly, breaking down the stains without me having to apply too much elbow grease. It was especially satisfying to see shiny, rejuvenated surfaces. However, I did notice that for certain super-old stains embedded on bathroom tiles, a second round was required for full removal. Even so, the product consistently delivered deep cleaning with a noticeable difference afterwards.

**Good Points**  
- Activated Oxi scrubbers that simplify tough cleaning tasks.  
- Effortlessly cleans multiple types of stains, including wine, coffee, and juice.  
- Suitable for a wide variety of surfaces, reducing the need for multiple cleaning agents.  
- A refreshing and subtle scent that doesn’t overpower the senses.  

[Check Henkel 00023400021932 price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b0c2xfq9pr/)

**Packaging and Quantity**  
With six 36-ounce bottles in the pack, I doubt I’ll be running out of this cleanser anytime soon. The generous sizing is a definite bonus for families or individuals who prefer stocking up on household essentials. I liked the clear instructions on the label, but the bulky packaging itself could prove to be a little annoying if you’re tight on storage space. Carrying around a large bottle during cleaning sessions may not be ideal for everyone, and I think a smaller, more portable option could’ve been a welcome addition.

**Areas of Concern**  
- The larger packaging can be impractical for small spaces.  
- Older, deeply embedded stains may require multiple applications.  
- It’s slightly less effective on very stubborn hard water stains compared to specialized cleaners.  

**Product Rivals**  
Compared to similar cleaners like Clorox Multi-Surface Cleaner or Lysol Power Bathroom Cleaner, this one stands out in its versatility. While Clorox focuses more on disinfecting rather than removing tough stains, Henkel’s product bridges the gap beautifully. It also appears less harsh on surfaces like ceramic sinks, where Lysol sometimes left a residue. However, if you’re someone who needs a heavier focus on germ-killing properties, you might lean toward a competitor rather than this cleanser. What Swiffer WetJets bring in ease of application, this cleanser counterbalances through targeted stain removal and longevity.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Given the performance and the six-bottle packaging, I would genuinely argue this product offers exceptional value. You don’t often find a cleaning product of this quality in significant quantities, and this is especially ideal for larger households or long-term storage. While there are cheaper options available, they often lack the stain-removal power and flexibility this product offers. It feels like a smart investment, especially if you’re aiming to simplify your cleaning process and reduce the number of products you keep buying repeatedly.

You want to fight back? Start paying attention to ownership. That ""local"" chain expanding into new markets overnight? Private equity money fuels that growth. The sudden menu price increases? Margin optimization. The understaffed dining room? Labor cost reduction.

Research before you eat. Most private equity ownership hides behind holding company names. Inspire Brands owns Arby's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Sonic, and Dunkin'^(11). GoTo Foods controls Auntie Anne's, Cinnabon, Carvel, and McAlister's Deli^(12). Both roll up under Roark Capital. One firm. Multiple brands. Same profit motive. The American Dream.

Support actual independent restaurants. The owner works the floor. The profits stay local. The decisions get made by people who live in your community. These places struggle against private equity's pricing power. They need your business more than corporate chains need your loyalty.

Ask questions. Where does this restaurant's profit go? Who makes the operational decisions? How do they treat workers? Real local businesses welcome these conversations. Corporate chains are unsure how to answer them.

The restaurant industry consolidation continues. Eddie V’s, LongHorn Steakhouse, Ruth’s Chris Steak House, The Capital Grille, Olive Garden, Yard House, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Chuy’s, Seasons 52, and Bahama Breeze are all owned by Darden Restaurants. Fewer owners control more restaurants. Your choices shrink while their profits grow. The solution isn't regulation. It's awareness. Know who owns your food. Choose accordingly.

Private equity firms bet you won't notice the difference between authentic local restaurants and corporate chains. They're counting on convenience overriding your values. They've made this bet a million times before.

Time to prove them wrong.

1nipafk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nipafk/a_perfect_day_for_naturafish/,A Perfect Day for Naturafish,"There was me, my sister, my mom, my dad and my grandparents on my mom's side in the small unit in the prefab apartment block on Bandaya Street in the capital. And, this morning, there was also you, visiting from overseas.

I still can't believe you got a visa.

They're very hard to get. 

But I'm so happy you're here, that I get to show you a little of my life here.

Right now, it's just past 06:30 and everyone but the sun and my sister are up. She's always been a late riser, but she'll get up eventually, and she'll be sharp as a tack right away. I'm more like my dad, up with the alarm clock but not really awake until a half-hour later.

He's shaving. I bet he nicks himself.

And mom and grandma are in the kitchen, making breakfast with whatever we managed to get yesterday. I'd absolutely kill for an egg, but what they're making does smell good.

Coffee?

Sometimes. Other times we get by on roasted barley with chicory.

My grandpa told us how, during the war, they'd make tea by steeping black, burnt bread crusts in water until the water turned brown. I'm so glad we don't have to do that anymore. We have real tea sometimes now.

Anyway, let's have a bite to eat, and then I'll show you what our days are like.

Sit anywhere you like. It's a small table, but we'll all fit. You're probably not used to tight spaces like these. You do get used to it. I've been living here almost my whole life. My parents were allocated this unit after my sister was born and we met the minimum family replacement size. No, we can't sell it, but it's ours until we don't need it anymore. Everyone of value gets a place to live.

“I'll wait for meat today,” mom says.

Grandma's staying home. Grandpa will try to get butter and milk. “What about you, dad?”

“Nails. Maybe soap.”

And my sister will get bread.

As for us, we'll try to get something special, a rarity. I'm off from school today so it's a “free” day for me. Whatever we get is a bonus.

OK, let's head out.

It's a nice day but you should probably take a jacket. It rains here out of the blue sometimes.

We go out of the unit, down the stairs because the elevator doesn't work, then out of the apartment block. There's a metal playground on the left, but it's empty of children because it's a school day. Surrounding us are generally more buildings identical to the one I live in, and then an exit toward the road. Few cars go by. Instead, most people are on foot, lined up on the sidewalk going both directions.

We join.

“What's that way?” I ask, pointing south.

“Fruit, coal and herring,” somebody says without looking at us. “Or so I hear.”

“And north?”

“Chocolate. That's what I always hope for. Maybe one day. I had chocolate once, a decade ago…”

“So these people don't know what they’re lining up for?” you ask me.

“Usually they have some idea, but not always. But there's always something at the start of a lineup. Otherwise people wouldn't line up.”

“How do they have time to just stand there?”

“Most of them don't work. The government is very efficient, so only the ones who need to work, work. The ones good at what they're doing. Everybody else, the normal people, we line up to get what the government provides. I know it's very different from the system you're used to.”

We stand in the line going north.

Slowly, we move.

Eventually, about an hour later, we come to an intersection. The roads are still empty, save for the odd black car every once in a while, which honks and which we make way for, so our lineup crosses the intersection at a diagonal, intersecting at one point with a line going a different direction.

“Keep right for chocolate?” I ask.

“Chocolate? This is the queue for vodka and beets,” says an elderly man.

“And the other one?”

He looks at me, at you. “Refrigerator sign-ups.”

“If you want chocolate, there's a rumour they're giving it out on Potomskaya Street,” someone yells from within one of the two lineups.

“Wishful thinking!” yells another.

We merge into the other lineup and continue, passing people on the right when we can. Some give us dirty looks. Others smile at us because we're young and have so much ahead of us. “Sorry, we're not queuing here. We're just trying to get through,” I offer repeatedly as an explanation.

“Where are we going?” you ask me, as I pull you along. Although this is all so mundane, I'm exhilarated that I get to share it with you. 

“To where the chocolate might be,” I say.

“What if there is no chocolate?”

“Then it'll be like every other day.” But I hope it's not. It can't be. Not with you here.

On the left, we pass a row of makeshift tents, people getting in and out of them. You ask who they are, and I explain that they're prospectors, citizens who attempt to predict the routes of future queues to be able to get a head start on them. “They sleep here?”

“Yes.”

By the time we reach the vicinity of Potomskaya Street, we hear engines and music, and I remember suddenly there's a foreign delegation in the city today, but before I can explain, a police officer stops us.

“Papers,” he says.

I pull mine out, and show him your passport and visa too. He examines the documents closely before handing them back. “Do you have non-queue travel permits?”

“As a student, I'm allowed—”

“Fine, yes.”

“Do you want to see my school identification card?”

“No,” he says. “That's fine.”

“Would it be possible to maybe get close enough to the delegation to take a look?” I ask. “My guest, she is in our country for the first time.”

“As long as you don't get too close,” he says, then drops his voice to a whisper: “And if you take Glory to the Revolution Pedestrian Overpass across to where the municipal district is, they're giving out Naturafish. Special token. Get one for your lady.”

I'm about to protest that I don't have a special token, I'm not from a well placed family, when I feel his hand touch mine and a token pressed into it “Thank you,” I whisper.

“Remember something. Life is beautiful, and it's a perfect day for Naturafish.”

I thank him again clandestinely and we head toward a hill from which we can see a bend in Potomskaya Street, and the foreign delegation being welcomed. The street is lined with people waving flags.

“So many people,” you say.

“Yes, to make a good impression. But they're not normal people. They're actors from the state acting academies. They're playing real people. Look—” I point, and you put your hand above your eyes to block out the sun. “—there's the actor playing me. Do you see?”

“I think so, but he looks nothing like you,” you say.

“There's probably an actress playing you too. They're always on top of who's here and who isn't, and I'm sure the foreign delegation would be honoured to meet you, by which I mean the actress playing you.”

“What do you think I'll say?”

“That you are impressed by the economic development of the country, the cleanliness of its public spaces, and the increase of its agricultural output.”

You smile, and I smile too. “But I'm sure she'll be nowhere near as pretty as you,” I say.

We walk down the hill hand in hand and join another lineup. Ahead, holding a small radio to his ear, a bearded man calls out, “Sixty fourth minute and still nil-nil, but the Uruguayans are fouling our boys like animals. Brutal tactics. They couldn't cope with our speed otherwise. Oh, what's this? A red card for Uruguay's captain and a free kick to us at the edge of the penalty area. Could this be the breakthrough?”

“That's Platonov,” I explain. “He's something of a folk hero around here. He used to be a very good footballer, before his injury.”

“I didn't know there were any matches going on right now,” you say.

“There aren't. Our team has been banned from international competitions by the governing bodies."" You notice that the radio isn't emitting any sound. “Platonov merely pretends to listen to a real football broadcast, and relates to us what he pretends, and we follow along. Even the newspapers report on what he pretends. Today, it's our second group match of the World Cup. We're in a group with Uruguay, Cameroon and the Netherlands. And once this World Cup is over in a few weeks, Platonov will pretend another into existence, and so on, so there's always a World Cup going on. In some ways, it's better than the real thing. We don't always win. In fact, we haven't even made the final since February of last year.”

“Why does he do it?”

“For the love of sport and his fellow man.”

“Goooaaalll!” Platonov yells. “What a strike, straight into the upper left corner. Sanchez-Lobos didn't stand a chance. We're ahead. Twenty-two minutes left. Can we hang on? A win would set us up perfectly for the final matchday, but even a draw will do. Come on, boys! Come on!”

Everyone in the lineup cheers, including me and you, and you lean against my shoulder.

The lineups wriggle forward like snakes, crossing, merging, intertwining and forking, splitting apart, like veins across the city. The people in them talk and laugh and commiserate. “How are you?” “My husband's sick again.” “It could be worse: you could be sick.” “My children are hungry.” “Whose aren't?” “Can you hold my place in line?” “Yes, sure.” “I'm waiting on medical results.” “So you're healthy at least until then.” “My washing machine broke again.” “It was a Sovpral. It did you a favour.” “We've no hot water in our building.” “The electricity goes out every day after fourteen o'clock, but you can come over and boil some to bathe your baby.”

It's late afternoon by the time we locate the queue the police officer told me about. It's shorter than the others, as all special token queues are. You can tell the individuals in this lineup are more refined, less plain. These are people who have performed services for the motherland.

Around us, the municipal district looks upon us in all its concrete neoclassical grandeur.

“This is a really nice spot,” you say.

“Yes, it cost a lot of money to build. The city was supposed to be governed from here.”

“Supposed?”

“It's abandoned. The buildings are empty, mostly unfinished on the inside. The project was part of a five-year plan, but it wasn't completed in time. The fifth year rolled into a sixth, and the new five-year plan didn't want to finish up the last one's projects. Every five-year plan wants to be independent, its own thing, you know.”

For the first time I'm nervous, feeling the token in my pocket with sweating fingers. What if it's a set-up? The lineup moves quickly, and soon we are the front, in one of the unfinished buildings. Two women, both dressed in grey, sit behind a counter. One holds out her hand as the other says, “Token, please.”

I hand it over.

“Is it true this is the lineup for Naturafish?” I ask.

“Yes,” says the first, handing me a small unmarked tin. I can almost smell what it contains. My eyes fill with tears, but I don't allow myself to cry. Mom and dad, sister, grandma and grandpa will be so pleasantly surprised. “Thank you,” I say, already pulling you by the hand and shuffling to the side so the next person in line may get their tin.

We take our time walking back.

It's already evening.

“What's Naturafish?” you ask softly, still holding my hand. It's a lovely feeling.

“It's a synthetic form of tuna manufactured from soybeans we receive from Brazil under the beneficial terms of our trade agreement.” Because I can see your smile wilt, “It's considered better than the real thing,” I add. “Better tasting, better for the environment, more nutritious and a domestically-made product on top of that. It's something of a point of pride for us, a symbol of what we're capable of as a state.”

We arrive back at the apartment just in time for dinner, which mom is preparing.

She did not succeed in getting any meat and did not want to camp out until morning, but dad managed two bars of soap and two batteries, sister got bread, and grandpa was able to get a bottle of milk but no butter. “Maybe I'll have better luck tomorrow,” he says.

“Butter luck,” you say, and everyone laughs.

The electricity falters then fails, which means the lights suddenly go out, but we have candles. I light them and arrange them across the unit.

The flames flicker in the breeze.

The light is warm.

“I wasn't in the mood for butter anyway,” says dad.

“Me neither,” adds sister.

At the end of the meal, I take out the tin of Naturafish and lay it on the table.

“Is it…”

“Yes,” I say.

In that moment, as I let grandpa open the tin, revealing the flakes of Naturafish inside, I know what you must be thinking. That it's a small tin. In your country, you would probably have one tin per person, and I wonder if you can ever truly understand what life is like here. But then mom passes out the dessert forks that dad and I made  from scrap metal years ago. And as we take turns tasting the Naturafish, talking, laughing, sharing the experiences of our days, I believe you can and do, and it fills me with the greatest joy.

“Does anyone happen to know if we won the match today?” dad asks.

“We were up 1-0 in the sixty-eighth minute,” you say.

“Dirty Uruguayans,” says grandma.

“I'm sure it'll be in the newspaper tomorrow.”

“Does anyone want coffee?”

“I do.”

“Me too.”

“But we've ve nothing to heat the water with,” I say, pointing at the candles.

Grandpa gets up from his chair, crosses to the window and looks out. “It seems they have power a few buildings down. I know a man who lives there, Ivan. I'll get some hot water from him and bring it back.”

“It's really no big deal. You don't have to,” you say.

“Don't be ridiculous,” says grandpa in that way we have of accepting gratitude by being mock aggressive. It means he likes you. 

I like you too.

I may not have much, but what I have I want to share with you. The sun sets. Grandpa returns. The water's no longer hot. Grandpa spent time talking to Ivan, whose daughter is getting married soon. But it's warm, and warm is good enough. Maybe not for real coffee, but for roasted barley and chicory it is, and that's all we have, and we're grateful for that, talking and laughing until bedtime.",5,1758046693.0,HFY,3,0.86,False
1nip9bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParentingADHD/comments/1nip9bm/anyone_else_feel_like_getting_through_the_routine/,Anyone else feel like getting through the routine is harder than the actual meltdowns?,"My 8yo has ADHD and mornings are the worst part of our day. I swear getting her through a school morning routine takes more out of me than teaching a full class of 25 kids. She’s either hyper-focused on the tiniest distraction (stickers, a sock, whatever) or she’s in tears because “everything is too much.” I’m running on coffee and guilt, wondering if I’m doing something wrong or if this is just ADHD life.

What’s actually helped us a ton is Goally. I don’t mean like “perfect child now,” but it’s the only thing that’s kept mornings from turning into full-on wars. Having the routine pop up step by step where she can see it has cut down on me nagging 200 times before 8am. It’s still messy, but at least she’s moving forward instead of spiraling. Curious if anyone else uses something like that, or if mornings feel like straight-up survival mode for your family too.",2,1758046623.0,ParentingADHD,1,0.75,False
1nip982,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1nip982/drug_addict_abuse_should_i_file_police_report/,Drug addict abuse - should I file police report?,"I knew this person for three years. They had always been reliable and supportive, but then they started doing excessive amounts of marijuana, ketamine, and God knows what else. I wasn’t totally aware of this.

I dealt with escalating verbal abuse, and being brought to tears for things as simple as sitting on my couch and reading a book. I was bullied daily. I now have a nervous tick because I’m expecting to be scolded for just existing.

One day he was sitting on my couch and I was upstairs, I think he overdosed. He started gurgling and screaming. I went down, trying to help him. I wasn’t aware that he had such a severe drug problem so I thought he was having a nightmare.  

He started telling me “fuck you bitch” and called me ugly. And then he hit me three times in my face. One of those times he hit me in my eye. 

I saw flashing lights, but then things were OK. Days later, it got worse - I have some mild but significant vision loss now that is permanent. He seems to act like I’m an aggressor and won’t talk to me so he doesn’t even know he did this to me. I wanted to give him this news in person so that I could see his eyes to see if he really wanted to do this to me.

He owes me at ~$1000 plus at least $400 for damages to my apartment. He also stole several things because he just freaked out screaming, grabbed everything and ran out of my apartment. His eyes were bulging out of his head and he had a snot rocket swinging out of his nose. It was so disproportionally unexpected. 

I thought we would be able to talk this out because frankly, I was in shock that somebody who I trusted would be so cruel to me. The outcome I want is I want him to never do this to another human being ever again. I do not want to make this a big deal and I don’t think the cops would do anything. 

That said, many of our mutual friends have approached me to share that they think he’s a loser which puts a hell of a lot of stress on me- and they still have shunned me. After going through this, it’s a terrible position I am in - people are sniffing around to find the real story out and I’m kind of in a position where I’m covering for him and it’s exhausting me. 

Some are neighbors so I feel like I need to move, which I can’t afford because I’ve just lost my job and had to pay med bills from above. 

One of the factors that singled me out for a layoff was that a year ago this guy came to a work party with me and showed one of my coworkers some marijuana. So while it wasn’t the main reason, he was a factor in losing my job as well.

I have done nothing wrong other than be kind. I’ve never lashed out at this person.

One of my friends is telling me now two months later I should file a police report because we were supposed to meet for coffee this week and talk this out and it looks like he’s ghosting me.

Other options I have are calling his family who will be unhappy with his behavior and likely do something. I can also warn his roommate. 

He’s screaming suicide and it doesn’t look like he’s going to last much longer if he keeps up this behavior. When his roommate is out, he apparently calls people and threatens to attempt suicide.

One thing I know for sure is that if I take these steps, it will probably end his career. He’s an actor in Los Angeles. I’m trying to give him every way to make this up to me and not let it get to that point. Mostly I want an apology, causing me a permanent injury in my eyesight. And I want my money back. 

Mostly, I’d like my friend back, but I don’t think my friend exists anymore. I think that’s holding me back from doing what I need to do.

Just looking for advice. I live in California if that helps.

I need to sell some cafe equipment, but honestly, I’m not sure which platform would be good. Could anyone recommend websites or methods for selling used equipment?

The items I’m selling are a Fetco coffee brewer and a Fetco grinder. They’ve been used for about 9 months, but since we barely sell drip coffee here, they were only used about every other day.",1,1758046455.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

What did you get? Were the lines for specialty coffee/shakes ridiculous? Did you think it was worth it? I know what is included, just wondering thoughts after seeing prices on board and using the package! Thanks for your thoughts!",2,1758046440.0,CarnivalCruiseFans,10,0.63,False
