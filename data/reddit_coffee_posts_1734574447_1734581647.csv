Bible Verse
-----------

Titus 2:1 (NIV): ‚ÄúYou, however, must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine.‚Äù

Meaning
-------

This verse is a call to action, emphasizing the importance of sound doctrine in our teaching and living. Paul, the author of the letter to Titus, wrote this to encourage Titus in his ministry. At its core, it reminds us that true teaching aligns with the core principles of the Christian faith.

Sound doctrine is foundational to a life well-lived. It not only ensures that our beliefs are aligned with truth but also guides our actions to be consistent with Godly principles. Paul recognized that by teaching sound doctrine, individuals and communities grow stronger in faith and become living examples to the world.

The broader context of Titus 2 highlights the different roles and responsibilities within a Christian community, reinforcing that sound doctrine is applicable to everyone, from young to old, men to women. It suggests that our teachings influence not just individual lives but also how communities thrive together in faith.

At a personal level, embracing sound doctrine equips us to face life‚Äôs trials with the right mindset and decisions, ensuring that our words and actions reflect our beliefs. By doing so, we become embodiments of the teachings of Christ, inspiring others to seek and uphold truth.

Actions to Take
---------------

1. Regularly study your Bible to better understand sound doctrine and how it applies to your life.

2. Seek fellowship with a community of believers who are dedicated to living and learning Biblical truths.

3. Reflect daily on your actions and words to ensure they align with Christian teachings.

4. Mentor someone in your life by sharing what you‚Äôve learned about sound doctrine and its importance.

5. Pray for wisdom and discernment to apply God‚Äôs Word accurately and effectively in every aspect of your life.

Journal Prompts
---------------

1. What does ‚Äúsound doctrine‚Äù mean to me, and how does it manifest in my daily life?

2. Reflect on a recent decision. How was it influenced by your understanding of Biblical teachings?

3. How can I better equip myself to teach and exemplify sound doctrine to others?

4. Who in my life models sound doctrine, and what can I learn from them?

5. What challenges do I face in aligning my actions with sound doctrine, and how can I overcome them?

Prayer
------

Dear Heavenly Father, thank You for Your Word that guides and sustains me. Help me to internalize sound doctrine and teach it through my actions and words. Grant me wisdom and understanding as I study the Bible, and surround me with a community that loves Your truth. May I live in a way that honors You and inspires others to seek Your teachings. In Jesus‚Äô name, I pray. Amen.

 have spoken to my partner but I need to know if what I am feeling and the action I want to take align with what others think. (I understand where my partner is coming from... But I don't want to I'm mad and upset)

Bit of a back story, I was raised by my dad and stepmom. I brought my mom back into our lives when I had my first born, with the contingency that my son would never experience the childhood I had with her, that lasted 12 months, then she verbally abused me over the voicemail for not answering her calls after she forgot my son's birthday. I didn't answer her calls because I was mowing the lawn and didn't realize she had rang.

My dad is not a big communications or emotional guy, I'm aware but he was always there, anyways, I had my son in 2020 and had issues then but voiced them on the regular and kept moving forward.
The issues I have is, my eldest sister lived at home with my parents and also had a child in 2020. My sister has not held a job in 12 years, got pregnant from a one night stand, is exceptionally lazy and regularly has sent my parents into debt because of her lifestyle. She also expected my parents to help raise her child as she didn't have a partner and the one night stand guy didn't want to be involved.
We didn't expect my parents to put in a huge amount of effort with my son, because at 50-55 they essentially had just become parents again, we got that. We would take my son over, do video calls, send photos etc etc. 
In 2022, my brother had a child, who unfortunately has a generic condition requiring a lot of extra assistance and travel for medical treatments, my parents helped out, and we understood again continued with making sure my parents were involved with my son.
By the end of 2022, my brother's child had got to a place where both my brother and his wife were doing less travel and less medical appointments, my sister has moved out into a government house. This is when we tried to get my parents more involved in my son's life, asking if they wanted to go for coffee, asking them over for dinner, asking if they would like to have my son over for a sleep over etc etc. but we were met with nothing. They were still always too busy or had organised to look after other children etc, fine no big deal, but eventually I was feeling like we were having a one sided relationship. So I stepped back, seeing if they would start to want to get involved in my child's life, this resulted in me not actually being spoken to not for stepping back, but because I was forgotten about. Such things as family dinners where we weren't invited, Christmas plans not being told about until the week of Christmas. I started referring to myself around my family as the forgotten child, this didn't help. I made a messenger chat with the family, never used for important things.
Moving into 2024, I had my little baby in October, i had a horrible pregnancy, I had severe morning sickness, I lost over 40lbs, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, I was induced due to excruciating pelvic pain. After birth I ended up with postpartum hypertension and was at risk of a heart attack at one point, safe to say it wasn't an enjoyable time. Once I was told I was being induced I had worked out for my son to go to my parents for 2 days and my in laws for 1 day and back to my parents as I was induced on my sister's sons birthday party weekend and the week before my partners sisters wedding. I knew full well my parents would be helping my sister with my nephews birthday party, but also my in laws needed time to assist with the wedding as it was a DIY wedding. But an important note is that it was also the weekend of my son's birthday.
I had informed my parents my partner would be picking up my son in the morning so I could see him for his birthday, we had set up my room like a little movie theater so I could make his day feel a little special. When my partner arrived, my stepmom got quite annoyed with him, as she had planned the day with him and had organised for my sibling and their kids to come over (not the case as I found out afterwards), he just took my son and left, he ended up keeping my son with him so I barely saw my partner during this time. 
Fast forward to my sister in laws wedding. I was told that I might be released from the hospital (after 12 days) that day. If it was during the ceremony I had told my partner I would get my parents to pick me up, being that his sister was getting married and all.
I messaged my parents to ask them if they could pick me up if I got released between 2 and 4 pm. Otherwise my partner would come and get me, I was told that they were going to see my grandfather and to message my brother. This wouldn't have been a big issue, except for 2 things, I needed their help, as they were going to have to go to my house to pick up my car as it had the baby seat in it, my car is a manual car and my brother's wife can't drive manual, and my brother had been working overtime as they were trying to pay off some of their childs medical bills and the other issue was, they still hadn't met my baby, 12 days later. I then got a passive aggressive message from my dad at around 10 pm that night that just said 'presume your home' I didn't respond, as their not being there when I needed them was the final straw and I ended up having a full mental breakdown due to the stress of everything that had happened in the last 12 days, and at this point in time I still couldn't get myself to the bathroom without a nurses help, as my pelvic pain ended up being caused by nerve damage.
After this i stopped putting in any updates on my baby in the family chat, no photos didn't tell anyone was happening unless they reached out, my brother and his wife were the only ones in my family to reach out.
Once I was home my partner let everyone know I was home, nothing more.
It took my parents 2 more weeks to come and meet their grandchild, and they came over unannounced. This triggered my partner as I was asleep, he asked them what they were doing here, and my stepmom turned around and walked away.
My dad came in and met my baby, my stepmom did too but after having a moment üôÑ
I decided then I wasn't going to share information with them any more, they knew about the medical stuff I was going through due to the hypertension and nerve damage, and was waiting to see if they would reach out. 
Nothing, complete radio silence. So since then my parents have seen me, and my family once, for my brother's birthday, and have not reached out at all.
My sister met my baby for the first time on my brother's birthday.
Moving forward until yesterday, it was my birthday. My dad since I was a kid, has done the same thing he has either sung, played or sent me a copy of In Da Club by 50cent on my birthday. (My dad calls my shorty because my family is all 6ft and above and I'm 5ft3)So it's a tradition that he made.
The only communication I get from my parents all day is a facebook post from my stepmom saying happy birthday, no text, no call, no visit. I waited all day for the link to the song, because it's his tradition, and I feel like it's not my birthday without it. I never got it.
My sister posted int he family chat happy birthday still nothing, so before I went to bed last night I sent a message to the chat that said 'Thank you to everyone who reached out, I really appreciate it' the only 2 people that would know what this was about is my dad and stepmom. And honestly I am ok with the Facebook message so mostly just my dad.
Today, obviously my brain has been going into full overdrive mode, what have I done, where have I gone wrong. But then I thought no, I am their child and I deserve to have at least a happy birthday message.
I spoke to my partner as said I'm done, if they don't want to be apart of our lives, I don't want our kids to be apart of their, simple as that. They don't deserve amazing kids!
My partner thinks I need to sit down, try and understand where my parents are coming from, I on the other hand want to cut all ties and be done with it all. 
What are your thoughts?

Side note, my parents live less then 20 minute drive away from my house. My dad has to drive past my house to get to work every day, and his work is across the road from my son's daycare, so it's not like we are cities away from each other.

i‚Äôm telling you right now‚Äîi literally switched my degree in college 3 TIMES. i started with pharmacy, then thought about being a kindergarten teacher, and now i‚Äôm in business administration. i don‚Äôt see myself using my degree much in the future, but i do know i might. of course, i‚Äôll be graduating soon. the big picture for me is real estate. honestly, i don‚Äôt know what i want to become... i just want to be rich and have money. who doesn‚Äôt? but when i was younger, kids seemed to always know what they wanted to do with their lives, what their passion was. if you asked me? recently i've seen that.. it would probably be actress. even THAT i am so unsure of.

there‚Äôs one thing i really enjoy though‚Äîstreaming video games. i‚Äôve been playing them since i was a kid, and it‚Äôs the one thing i can really get into. but if i‚Äôm being honest, not everyone is going to pop off and get famous, like caseoh, for example. twitch is an oversaturated market. there‚Äôs a chance for everyone, sure, but i don‚Äôt know if i have what it takes. if i did, i'd probably be popular by now. i realllly don't mean to sound lame lmao. this is just how i feel / am as a person.

i looked it up... it‚Äôs called shiny object syndrome. not sure if that‚Äôs exactly what i have, but i‚Äôm just trying to figure out why i act this way. a lot of the time, i‚Äôll think of a new career idea and it sounds so exciting. like, i literally thought about quitting my cosmetics business to sell something else... because if i‚Äôm being honest, running a small, home-based business can feel like a mess sometimes. i‚Äôve even considered opening a coffee shop. i‚Äôm everywhere but nowhere and it‚Äôs driving me crazy. i‚Äôve felt like this for a while now. then i see other people doing things, and it sparks some motivation in me. i sometimes pick up on what others are doing, but i still can‚Äôt figure out how to stay focused on one thing.

Just use this to help prepare for the verbal discussion yet to come, and take any notes you may also want to better organize your thoughts /that's why I was writing it for myself anyhow. When last I tried and was ready for us to address it, you expressed to me that we aren't going talk about it right now, I asked you if we were going to readdress it later on and you reassured me of that. I'm not going to push for your answers, or this conversation, because what you read was primarily negative/focused on the issues at hand. This is why I understand, and am not trying to push you into reopening the conversation, as well as your seeming unwillingness to circle back around for us to talk. So if you do end up seeing this, I hope you can understand. I'm so anxious because I not only wish to address my perspectives, but yours as well. I wish only to ensure that we can begin to heal what's been harmed, before it becomes too late for any adjustments to have any true value to one another. When you read through these bits, I had yet to finish my notes. What was there got organized and put into a much healthier form of communication. You only got to read a section of things surrounding this subject. 

""Firstly, any hurt that occurs when you inevitably move on, is absolutely unavoidable. Regardless of our relationship status, or any previous conversations being had beforehand, I will still be hurt. If I need to, I'll deal with that when/if that happens, cause that will not ever change. Thank you for addressing and apologizing for where you felt you went in an unhealthy direction with our communications. It truly means more to me than you can ever imagine, and I forgive you for all of it, of course. I love you, and I hope that this discussion can show you how much you and our relationship really means to me.


Are we both willing to restart, and heal our relationship together, as a team, equally, with respect for one another, without shaming, passive aggression, criticism, accusations, stonewalling, or invalidating one another?
My answer is yes, I also acknowledge that we are both human and so may make mistakes in this. So if I do, please hold me accountable and please bring it to my attention in these scenarios. I will do my best to do the same for you, as well.

Before anything, can we talk about what boundaries we need to set in this conversation together, and discuss what needs we both have in order for us to feel closeness, appreciation, consideration for, and loved by one another in this relationship? Because I want you to feel loved, respected, and valued in this relationship. I want us to be able to work together to repair what we've both done to harm this relationship, because you - this relationship - means more to me than I ever could have imagined when we first messaged each other on Whisper.  

Boundaries & Needs in Discussions/the Relationship: 


When I'm being accusatory, please bring that to my attention in the moment, and ask me what it is I'm feeling and what it is that's causing me to feel that way ; this will help me to identify those underlying emotions in the moment, and avoid making absolute statements or anything else that may cause our relationship further harm. If I am being consistently invalidated for healthily stating my feelings, I will say ""pancakes"", this will be my safe-word to signify not only to you what is happening in that moment, but that I need to take a step back from the conversation for 30 or so minutes to keep either of us calm, and as rationally minded as possible so we can safely have these kinds of discussions, and improve on whatever we need to from that conversation.

What I need to feel closenees with you, is more consistency in open and honest communication, quality time, and affection (outside of sexual scenes specifically). Consideration of, and validation of my feelings when I express them, as well as periodic check-ins, to ensure that there aren't any feelings being left unresolved between us that could create animosity or resentment for one another. If we need to step away from a conversation for a period of time for whatever reason, it's okay for us to need that, and even detrimental to our relationship for us to be able to recognize that need in order to preserve each others/our own emotions and our relationship. (This is something I obviously need to, and will be working on) But whomever initiates this break period needs to be held accountable for reopening the conversation when the tensions are released, otherwise we are just invalidating one another feelings. I'm not asking you to agree with, or that what it is I say is causing me to feel those emotions is true or happening, but if you wish to show me that I am a priority to you, I need to know that you can show consideration for, and validate my emotions. I feel loved by you when you hold me under your arm, I feel loved by you, when I catch you randomly staring at me from across a room. I feel loved by you when you're considerate of when I've last eaten, or wether I'm drinking enough water. You make me feel loved by you when you show me your vulnerability, when you've allowed me to see that side of you, I feel so special to you. I've felt loved by you when you make me coffee in the morning, or when you get upset with me for not having, or eaten enough in too long, or make me food without me asking, or even at times forcing me to eat something/anything when I don't want to. I feel loved when you get on my ass about picking, or when I'm biting my nails too much. I feel loved by you when you occasionally give me multiple kisses in a row, even when they're just little pecks of affection. I feel loved when you brush, or play with, or run your hands through my hair. I feel loved when you take my hand in yours, or lay into my lap and grumble at me for moving or trying to get up, and when you randomly slap, or squeeze my ass. I feel loved when you hold me from behind, or stuff your hands in my pockets, or make me put mine in yours while we are standing together. I feel loved when you offer me your jacket, or put it on me without even asking because you already know I'm cold. I feel so lucky to be yours everyday, and I hope you know that throughout all of your heart and being, I hope you feel it in your bones - the ways in which you make me feel loved are inumerable, and  I hope you feel the same everyday.

I should not have disrespected you or your boundaries when you tried to cool off from the discourse by continuing to push the conversation forward, being passive aggressive, and presenting/reenacting the things from our past which have hurt me in our relationship. It was wrong, and inconsiderately immature of me to do to you, and for those things, I'm deeply sorry as I know how much that must have hurt you. It was an extremely mature and considerate decision on your part. By doing so, you showed me that you truly value what we've built together in this relationship, I should have listened to you, and been more aware of how I was causing you to feel without interrupting. I don't ever wish for you to feel attacked, or that you have any need to become defensive when things which are causing strain on our relationship are being presented. I need you to know and feel that you are safe with me to be vulnerable and discuss anything, but especially things that are hurting you, as well as enforcing your boundaries when needed, without worry of being shamed, invalidated, or made to feel unimportant, or undesired, or unloved by me. I never wanted to hurt you, or our relationship in these ways, I was overstimulated and begging for you to validate what I was feeling, and to know that you could recognize the actions or words which had hurt me; I will be working hard on learning and developing healthier communication skills to ensure this doesn't ever happen again.

I inaccurately believed that I was being vulnerable with you, which I can see now wasn't true to that moment. I was being straight up immature in my behavior. I know, and realize that the things I was doing as well as how I was trying to express what I am now saying to you made you feel attacked, and unable to feel safe in being vulnerable with me, which is what caused you to react in the ways you did. I feel terrible for having made you feel this way, and for that, I also apologize. 
When these things were going on, I felt that my emotions were not valid and that I was not a priority to you, so I acted out of a place in which I felt unsupported, unloved, and undesirable to you. I want you to know that I truly appreciate you and everything you do and have done for me -for us- in this relationship. I would like you to express with me how you felt/feel about the things I have said or done to you since we've been together that I may not have addressed or been able to recognize up to this point so that I can take accountability for everything, and hopefully allow for me to understand you better.

Right now I‚Äôm doing:
Intermittent fasting 
>will break fast with cheese and meat (usually raw Gouda, Brie, or blue) and either steak, chicken, etc.

Then after about an hour or so, if I‚Äôm still hungry, I‚Äôll have some clean carbs. Things like total 2% yogurt, no sugar granola, a tbsp of peanut butter, some honey and some blueberries. And I‚Äôll have vegetables with my steaks and cheeses (peppers, saut√©ed spinach, etc). 

Throughout the day I‚Äôll snack on meats and cheeses, limiting my carbs. I barely eat any carbs outside of what‚Äôs listed above. I don‚Äôt eat bread.

I‚Äôll have some raw milk and kombucha at night, but not together. The milk makes me sleep well.

I have gotten in really good shape before from a straight keto plan, but really want to incorporate good carbs. 

I‚Äôm worried that because of my keto habit, I‚Äôm actually eating too much fat. But then you‚Äôre just in the wheelhouse of clean eating I think, and not really doing anything unique. I don‚Äôt want to start counting my macros/calories‚Ä¶if I must, maybe, but I‚Äôm trying to really find a good balance here.

Zoom is an option for those who are unwell or old. But apart from the elderly or immunocompromised (cancers, and other verifiable illnesses), it's frowned upon to join online. So my husband and I are forced to be in-person, while our elderly parents are on zoom. Needless to say, ever since things reopened, we've been falling sick. At least two rounds of covid each, hospitalizations, and three of us have long covid and complications. 

We always mask up almost all the time (there are rare occasions when barely anyone is there or when we have to remove our masks to drink water or grab a snack). We carry air purifiers and sanitizing sprays. Lots of xlear, xylitol gum. Betadine gargles after returning. The only thing we haven't invested in (yet) are far-uvc devices. People who attend the gatherings typically don't mask unless they are actively unwell. They've been told several times not to come in-person if they are sick, but it doesn't seem to get into their heads. Added to that is the fact that the hall isn't ventilated. There are air conditioners running, but my air quality monitor is constantly on red, with numbers ranging between 3000 and 5000, which is the maximum that can be measured. My husband and I work from home, we eat outside only at places that have open air seating and during weekdays so that we're often the only ones there. We've not been to theatres, malls or other crowded indoor spaces, and since we're introverts who love our own company, this works out pretty well for us. So basically, the only place where we might possibly fall sick is at these religious gatherings.

Now that there is some background to the entire thing... here's my timeline of being unwell:

Sunday morning - possible exposure

Sunday night - just a feeling that something was wrong

Monday morning - woke up with severe sinusitis with the left side of my head and face being the most affected. Lots of sneezing, but it seemed more like a head cold. By night, my throat started feeling strange...more like when the throat is dry because of extreme thirst. 

Tuesday - sinus pressure decreased after drinking loads of echinacea tea and steam inhalation, but the sneeze worsened. Throat felt like there were a million knives attacking it each time I swallowed. I started betadine gargles immediately, five times a day. Stepped up on the echinacea tea and added ginger and honey to it. Tested negative.

Wednesday - sinusitis was completely resolved. Sneeze was about 90% gone. Throat was 95% better. However, my lungs started feeling tight and there was a cough that was getting progressively worse. I just got over a lower lung infection two months ago and this felt the same, or worse. Tested negative again. I switched to a cough syrup that my doctor had prescribed the last time. By night, I'd lost my sense of smell completely (it has come back only about 75% since my last covid infection in 2023) and taste was half gone. Oxygen dropped to 92. 

Thursday - woke up with lungs feeling a bit freer. Probably the cough syrup helped. Tested negative again. Mild fever since last night, not more than 99.5 degrees F. Sense of smell was fully out for an hour or so after waking up. It returned briefly for about half hour and then went again. It's been sporadically on and off since then, but when it does come back it's very mild. I still have a cough, though it's productive now. Can't really walk much without getting breathless.

I am holding off from going to the doctor yet, because there's been a sharp rise in respiratory infections over the last couple of weeks. Will continue to test over the next few days because I'm aware that the newer variants are evading tests. The timeline seems very weird, though. And it's like I've got symptoms indicating that it's covid but tests are negative. I do seem to be getting rid of symptoms pretty fast and I'm confused. I've been taking black seed oil and honey for the past few months. Switched from regular coffee to mushroom coffee as well as mushroom gummies to boost immunity. There's an anti-inflammatory tea that I drink daily (dandelion root, blackseed, ashwagandha, milk thistle seeds, and at times a bit of sage, turmeric and black pepper). We have cut out processed foods and eat an anti-inflammatory diet. Could it be that my immunity is good and my body is fighting off the virus fast? The first time I got covid, I was extremely sick for three weeks. The second time I didn't really notice because we all fell sick and I had to care for an elderly parent at the same time, so I didn't get a chance to really observe what's been happening with me. My lung infection (didn't check for covid back then) progressed within hours to a point where I couldn't walk without gasping for air, and took four weeks to resolve. This round has me confused. I know I'm not out of the woods yet, my lungs could tighten up at any time and the drop in symptoms could be a sign of either really good immunity or my immune system failing to fight. But has anyone seen such rapid changes in symptoms? Is there anything I need to watch out for? It looks like covid and feels like covid but the home tests say it isn't covid.

but it wasn‚Äôt just that, was it? no‚Ä¶ you were brilliant at making me tremble in other ways. late nights, no sleep and extra coffee in the morning. I can still feel that pulling ache in my lower belly, the thirst in the back of my throat, the way you left me exhausted but caught on fire. it was a constant cycle, you fill me up, suck me dry, I felt too full, I was too empty. back and forth, over and over. give it to me, take it away.  

and then you realized, you could do more. that was really the beginning to the end, I think. when you realized that trembling from adoration was controllable, trembling from sex was validating, but trembling from fear was power.

1hhjxyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pomona/comments/1hhjxyx/a_monopoly_at_the_heart_of_pomona/,A monopoly at the heart of Pomona,"The downtown Pomona area has transformed itself into the center of culture throughout the years. It‚Äôs home to iconic music venues like the Fox Theater and the Glasshouse. It hosts an art walk twice a month that gives local artists the avenue to showcase their work. Coffee shops like Wish You Were Here and Mi Cafecito have attracted foot traffic from outside cities.

The thriving art colony has been put together by the Arteco Partners, a Pomona-based ‚Äúre-developer focusing on constructing creative communities through adaptive-reuse of historic structures and infill development in mixed-use downtown neighborhoods throughout Southern California‚Äù

Arteco has preserved the historical buildings by intertwining modern consumerism into the roots of Pomona. Without their vision, the downtown area would still be stuck in the past, slowly rotting, one underground rave at a time.

Yet, the heart of the city has not reached its full potential because it's been stifled by Arteco ownership. The developing company owns the majority of an entire block, creating a monopoly of the Downtown Pomona area.

The title pretty much says it all. When women are asked about men they are always talking about traits of men they already find attractive.

When I score 1st dates, I‚Äôm pretty much always guaranteed a 2nd date if I want one. But getting that first date is really hard. Girls flake a lot, sometimes ghost, sometimes flake last second. Not blaming them at all, the dating market is about supply & demand, just trying to learn more about the behind the scenes mentality.

It is something I could practice daily and has practical application when I have company. I want to begin with pour-overs and work my way up to manual espresso machines.

My current setup includes an OXO gooseneck, Kingrinder K6, random scale, and a v60 with a2 filters. Coffee of choice is Top Of The Morning coffee. I know it's not ""amazing"" coffee, but I prefer to buy stuff from my favorite content creators when possible. I may upgrade my grinder to a K-ultra and have my eye on the flair 58 as future purchases. I am open to suggestions. I personally don't think the black matte aesthetic is worth it, plus I kind of like the glass/metal chemistry lab look I have going on lol.

My main question is will my coffee eventually become less bitter? I have lighter/medium roasts and I've tried some espresso from my local shop that has its own single source and blended beans, but it's still bitter. Personally, I love the vegetal bitterness of matcha, but coffee is just a harsh bitter. I do understand that there will always be some natural bitterness in my brew, but still..

I‚Äôm sorry for loving and caring about you more profoundly than anyone else in your life ever has. 

I‚Äôm sorry for being the one who would drop everything in an instant whenever you needed me, or whenever you were in distress, without a second thought. 

I‚Äôm sorry for treating your dog as if they were our child, nurturing them through illness with the same dedication I offered you.

I‚Äôm sorry for the understanding I showed during the many times suspicions arose, suspicions I never voiced, though perhaps I should have. 

I‚Äôm sorry for not confronting you when anyone else, regardless of gender or identity, might have demanded answers. 

I‚Äôm sorry for holding your hair back, rubbing your back while you were sick, taking care of you so tenderly in those vulnerable moments.

I‚Äôm sorry for taking on the role of caregiver, for buying your prescriptions, your groceries, and covering the cost of every meal, every coffee. 

I‚Äôm sorry for opening doors for you felt you like a gentleman, and using constant manners‚Äî‚Äúyes, please‚Äù and ‚Äúno thank you.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sorry for being a gentleman in general.

I‚Äôm sorry for absorbing the hurtful words you threw my way, each one like a shard of glass, cutting deep‚Äî‚Äúdon‚Äôt ever fucking talk to me again,‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôre fucking done,‚Äù ‚ÄúI fucking hate you,‚Äù ‚Äúyou fucking bitch,‚Äù ‚Äúyou entitled piece of shit.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt endure more instead of expressing how your hurtful  words and diatribe‚Äôs inflicted wounds and subsequent scars. 

I‚Äôm sorry for always treating your family and friends with kindness, respect, and genuine interest. For the hours I spent making your condo spotless, every corner, every room‚Äîeven the toilets and beneath your bed where dust and hair collected over years of neglect. 

I‚Äôm sorry for standing up for you to others, going as far as filing a police report to ensure your safety when you felt threatened, or paranoid by a homeless man who never once approached or spoke to you.

I‚Äôm sorry for crafting surprise dates and for uttering words that moved you to tears, words that touched you in ways I never imagined possible. 

I‚Äôm sorry for singing to you, for the times we harmonized or when you broke down over songs your father loved, without me knowing their significant.

I‚Äôm sorry I called you the missing price to my puzzle.

I‚Äôm sorry that I dedicated Songbird by Fleetwood Mac to you and you got emotional because your father loved that song but also would play it for you when you were a kid. I‚Äôm sorry you never shared this with me, but I‚Äôm sorry I reminded you of your father. 

I‚Äôm sorry I was the man you said your deceased father would have adored. 

Im sorry for getting pet insurance for your dog, for ensuring she was well-cared for with new food and vet visits. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the one time I forgot my wallet after a vet visit, prompting you to call me cheap‚ÄîI never intended to upset you. I‚Äôm sorry you were so angry after that. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the weekly  journeys I made by train and bus, traveling to be with you every Thursday through Sunday, sacrificing my time and comfort.

I‚Äôm sorry for never questioning the absence of photos from your ‚Äúgirls trips‚Äù and for being subjected to your anger each time I asked about friends whose names I never learned.

I‚Äôm sorry you chose baby names and pressured me into having sex with you in order to potentially get you pregnant, even though I wasn‚Äôt ready because it was still early on, and because we needed to figure a lot out still for me to be in a place where I felt we were both ready for that. Actually‚Ä¶ I did, several times. I even ensured I didn‚Äôt finish inside of you because my boundaries were routinely being crossed, and you continued.

I‚Äôm sorry for performing oral on you when you would demand and curse at me to do so explicitly. Do you  Remember when you bragged about demanding it later that one day before the Halloween party? I‚Äôm sorry you shared that with me. 

I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt  get you pregnant, even though you weren‚Äôt ready to be a mother. I‚Äôm sorry you still had to confront your reality and the truth of your reality before bringing a child into the world. 

I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt get you pregnant while there were disturbing things occurring behind my back during the entire duration of our relationship, and bringing a child into that situation would‚Äôve been disturbing. I‚Äôm sorry I felt that way. 

I‚Äôm sorry that when you would grab my hips and pull me in closer while I was finishing, even as I physically resisted, all while telling me to ‚Äúget you pregnant‚Äù and to ‚Äúfill you up.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sorry you had a manic look in your eyes when you would do that every time we had sex after the first month or dating and until the implosion‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sorry for feeling powerless in those moments, for not knowing how to assert myself by telling you what tou were doing frightened me.

I‚Äôm sorry for not giving in towards the end of us, to your physical force which you would use with me inn during  these moments.  I was scared of you , and for how deeply that crossed my boundaries.

I‚Äôm sorry that you didn‚Äôt get pregnant and therefore couldn‚Äôt get out of the things you were doing behind my back, or the life you were secretly leading, Heisenberg. 

I‚Äôm sorry you weren‚Äôt honest with me. I would‚Äôve rescued you from that life.

I‚Äôm sorry that I could have financially took care of you forever, and protected you forever as I promised I would‚Äôve. 

I‚Äôm sorry you picked lonely old men and their money, to fake attraction and relationships, even love with them. 

I‚Äôm sorry that the money you make doing this doesn‚Äôt change how alone and lonely you‚Äôve been and you‚Äôll always be? Who knows‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sorry that when you talked about and would plan our future, you beamed with a smile that could light up the world, dreaming of beating your sister to the altar or into motherhood. I‚Äôm sorry for how much of a savage your sister is. I‚Äôm sorry how horrible the relationship is and always will be between the two of you. 

I‚Äôm sorry for discussing marriage and homes in neighborhoods where you wanted to live, even though my job was an hour away. 

I‚Äôm sorry I put an offer on one of those eight million dollar homes two days before it all imploded.

I‚Äôm sorry I purchased one to the Tiffany engagement rings that you loved. Remember? During the second weekend we were together? we went to Tiffany‚Äôs, and I wrote down your favourite engagement rings. I always kept that piece of paper for a reason. 

I‚Äôm sorry I bought it and planned the proposal that never happened. 

I‚Äôm sorry for inquiring about your ‚Äúbusiness,‚Äù offering help with marketing, using my MBA and business acumen to support you, only to be met with evasion and silence. I‚Äôm sorry for questioning the lack of social media updates for two years for your ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry you were reluctant to speak of clients. Even when I just asked how work was going.

I‚Äôm sorry for being okay when you brushed me off after my aunt passed, for respecting your busy schedule over my grief. 

I‚Äôm sorry for always valuing your feelings, your emotions, even when they were wielded like weapons against me‚ÄîI‚Äôm not a fighter, except when it comes to defending my heart.

I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt have more time to manipulate, gaslight, and abuse me. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the way your life is built on lies and deceit, for cheating on someone who loved you more than you could comprehend, all while living a double life and lying to everyone in their life, all while being workings as an escort. 

I‚Äôm sorry you lied prior to us even meeting. 

I‚Äôm sorry you posed as someone you weren‚Äôt seeking a long term relationship on Hinge. 

I‚Äôm sorry you never were honest with me because I would‚Äôve asked you to quit, not have been made by your cheating, and we could‚Äôve moved on by having and fulfilling the dreams we constantly discussed, which you always initiated even. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you weren‚Äôt more creative with your front for a career and small business. 

I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt ask you more about the ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù you would constantly or randomly have and I would get upset despite never meeting them or knowing their names, or anything about them.

I‚Äôm sorry most of them likely wear elderly diapers, and have grey public hair. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you would get upset for me asking any further questions about your ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù after you brought the buddies (lol the word gets me still). 

I‚Äôm sorry that you would have likely have to change their diapers, and honestly, you should have just became a nurse instead.

I‚Äôm sorry for the marriages you destroyed and the children left without a father. Did that make you feel better for the tragic loss of your father? 

Im sorry that while on the phone, you threatened to jump off your balcony, and then left me on the other end, as you opened your balcony door, and I cried, begged, pleaded for you to be okay and not hurt herself for eight minutes that were the scariest eight fucking minutes of my life.

I‚Äôm sorry that when I threatened to call the police, you finally came back to the phone and pretended that you never threatened to jump off your balcony.

I‚Äôm sorry you accused me of wanting you to get better. I‚Äôm sorry you accused me of ‚Äúwanting you committed‚Äù, even though that wasn‚Äôt true and you never were committed, nor did anyone ever approach you about committing yourself. 

I‚Äôm sorry for you creating random fights between us, somehow making them my fault, and for me giving in and apologizing afterwards despite you conjuring these random fights to create space for a couple days between us so you could hang out with your buddies and get paid I suppose? I‚Äôm sorry for what they likely did to you.. I‚Äôm sorry there‚Äôs reviews online about your performance.

I‚Äôm sorry about one reviewer detailing how you were in bed with them three days after my birthday. 

I‚Äôm sorry that I would‚Äôve given you the financial freedom and wealth in addition to ensuring that you were the happiest woman to ever take a single breath on this earth. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you decided being an escort and being paid by lonely men was more important than what we had built and what you had told me you wanted for your life with me‚Ä¶ our life. 

I‚Äôm sorry that confronting you after being sent confirmation of who you really were randomly one morning.

I‚Äôm sorry that I always hoped, and fucking wished it was just a suspicion and I‚Äôm sorry for keeping it to myself without being resentful either. 

I‚Äôm sorry your sister had the same suspicions two years prior and you slapped her across the face for ‚Äúeven insinuating I would be a fucking hooker, a whore, or an escort‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm sorry that me knowing made you anxious because of your unwillingness to ever get help for your anxiety and paranoids.

I‚Äôm sorry your feared your sister‚Äôs judgment, even though your sister abuses her fianc√© daily and hasn‚Äôt even shown a person, or even her dog an ounce of kindness for even one second of her life. 

I‚Äôm sorry you put her potentially finding out even though she wouldn‚Äôt have, over the person who loved you more than any family, friend, ex boyfriend or girlfriend..: and buddy! Ever has or ever would have.

I‚Äôm sorry your sister will have to wait a little longer before she finds out the truth.

 I‚Äôm sorry for your loss false, horrific, disgusting, and appalling false accusations against me, which l led to me being arrested because I knew the truth.

I‚Äôm sorry you pretended to love me you went as far as to not only blanatntly lie  because as you would say, ‚Äúno one will ever believe a man could be abused by a woman. 

I‚Äôm sorry you use this twisted mentality twice against me just because you broke my heart and cheated on me for a year, all just to silence me not just from your abuse, but for your disaster of a sister not kicking you outbid her wedding party and disowning you for life.

I‚Äôm sorry she will regardless, because she‚Äôs an evil and jealous person.  

I‚Äôm sorry that I wrote these letters in my mind for each of the two 25 hour stints in jail, which caused me having uproot my life, forget what privacy is, ever think about romance and the learning the concept of trust is a waste of time and no one should or can be trusted again. 

I‚Äôm sorry you taught me that everyone‚Äôs actually evil.

I‚Äôm sorry I never crossed any boundaries with you of any kind, and I have all your texts that contradict your allegations. I‚Äôm sorry these texts also explicitly show that you were the blanat abuser in every manner‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry you won‚Äôt be coming up with these letters, or anything creative while you spend a large part of the rest of your life behind bars. I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre not creative, emotionally available, or charismatic enough for people to care about whatever you may have to say about a tik tok video you saw before you went to prison. 

I‚Äôm sorry you never became the influencer you thought you could be despite not having anything to say or interesting character traits that anyone would care about. I‚Äôm sorry you thought this was possible despite your regular eight likes on tik tok. 

I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt want to break bail again and spend the holidays and beyond, in a jail cell, while I‚Äôm still in a mental prison without physically being in a jail or prison cell.

I‚Äôm sorry you wore my clothes in a TikTok shortly after my first arrest and flaunted your life as if my world hadn‚Äôt shattered. Im sorry how un-credible of a witness you won‚Äôt ever get a chance to be‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry we didn‚Äôt meet years earlier, when we lived across the street, shopped at the same stores, banked at the same place, walked our dogs in the same neighborhood. I wish I could have steered you away from the path you chose, even though I didn‚Äôt know you then.

I would‚Äôve saved and protected you. I would‚Äôve never left‚Ä¶ ever.

I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt apologize when I confronted you upon finding out the day before I confronted you.

I‚Äôm sorry you sought out killing me and attempting to ruin my life as a better alternative.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù‚Ä¶ the words you believe every one, even people you‚Äôve never met and won‚Äôt ever meet owe you for reasons that you don‚Äôt even understand. 

You‚Äôre not the victim of any previous, current and future delusion. 

No one owes you as many sorry‚Äôs as you believe that all eight billion people on earth owe you.

You need to learn how to apologize to yourself first, for the people you‚Äôve literally killed and hurt, shattered, torn apart, cheated on, and discarded them like the gunk stuck to your shitty samba‚Äôs a 75 year old paraplegic likely got you after you gave them a happy ending. 

Apologize to your family for your lies of a decade or longer, apologize to your sister for assaulting her, to the mother you abandoned and blocked, all while leaving her with an apparent abuser (your words). 

You won‚Äôt. Or maybe‚Ä¶ fuck me‚Ä¶ fuck me for believing that you want to scream into the void because you‚Äôre fully aware of the damage you‚Äôve caused throughout your adult life to everyone you‚Äôve crossed paths with, and an amazing person is there. I saw her many times and I wanted to fucking hug you to through FaceTime the night before we last spoke because I saw a person who was destroyed, and desperately hurting because of the secret they harboured, and perhaps the dangerous, and evil people within their orbit who they wished died so you could live without fear any longer and be your true, loving, amazing, and strong individual that you truly fucking are.

Despite everything, you remain a beautiful person, inside and out. I see the good in you, the potential for happiness and health, if only you hadn‚Äôt destroyed what we had. Your father would want you to be okay.

I remember the night you asked me to promise to always protect you and never leave, and how I held you as tears streamed down my face.

In that embrace, I felt your anxiety, your fear, your loneliness, and I promised to always love you, more than all the galaxies out there, even those that haven‚Äôt been discovered yet. 

‚ÄúMore than the aliens?‚Äù you asked, our little joke. Yes, more than those aliens you adore. ‚ÄúI love you, and I‚Äôll love you forever. I‚Äôll never let you go.

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for still loving you and believing in you, and my fucking heart. 

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for the moment I finally get to tell you how much I love you again. 

I‚Äôm NOT and how I told you that I would always protect you, even after everything that you‚Äôve done. 

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for abandoning you like everyone else has throughout your life. 

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for saving you and showing you how beautiful life can be, or for teaching you that  every day doesn‚Äôt have to be dark like Alaska. 

You‚Äôre beyond worthy of your yellow brick road.

except i'm actually an extremely awkward closet weeb!!! who uses chatgpt to paraphrase everything they say to sound like this!!

why? you see, i'm extremely awkward and don't feel comfortable talking to my friends about chainsaw man since none of them are weebs... we have a discord server, but all i do most of the time is watch since none of them are interested in anime („Å£ÀòÃ© v ÀòÃ©)„Å£

so, i took some inspiration from Fujimoto and as a result is now a non-existing little sister who will talk about anime to anyone who will listen ‡¥¶‡µç‡¥¶‡¥ø ÀâÕàÃÄÍí≥ÀâÕàÃÅ )‚úß

i even based aspects of my persona off of nagayama koharu! ""my"" birthday is the same as Fujimoto's, and the meaning of the kanjis in koharu's name are aspects of ""my"" name as well! i'm not telling you guys my username in case my friends see this post, obviously (¬¨‚Äø¬¨ )

this is my plan:

1. join discord server and tell everyone that i am new to this discord thing!!!
2. ramble about chainsaw man and anime!!!
3. convert my friends. then it's MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!! ‚∏ú( \*Àä·µïÀã\* )‚∏ù

a breakdown of my friends:

* programmer i think, likes history and politics. probably autistic
* gamer furry :3
* guy
* vocaloid fan & eldritch horror enjoyer. has seen bocchi & dungeon meshi. probably the first person i'll be able to convert to full on weeb ‡¥¶‡µç‡¥¶‡¥ø(Àµ ‚Ä¢ÃÄ ·¥ó - Àµ ) ‚úß

1hhjr27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1hhjr27/how_do_i_tell_her/,How do I tell her?,"My wife and I have always talked about opening a coffee shop or something since we met. I know nothing of the food business, but I know business and my wife went to school for baking & pastry arts. She has been a SAHM for the past 6yrs, but started a home cookie business this summer and it's doing good; she's selling a bunch and supplying cookies to a catering company (and I'm not losing weight since cookies are my weakness). The caterer has a sublessee in his spot moving out in the summer and my wife and I talked about doing coffee/breakfast there and splitting the rent and utilities 50/50. 

A few weeks ago, we started on the path to franchise ownership and had some good meetings. Nothing in our coffee shop dream, but good industries that have a good model. Well, this week, a local coffee shop put up signs they are closing. The caterer talked to my wife and said he wants to capitalize on it and get coffee in sooner now and my wife agreed. As soon as she told me this, I shut down the franchise talks and said we were exploring an independent storefront opportunity (we, as in my wife and I, since she was included on the franchise meetings). Turns out the caterer's wife used to manage a Starbucks, so she'd be on board as well and would probably quit her currently unrelated job. My wife went to drop off cookies at the shop and came home and told me they are going to do it, and how excited she is for the three of them. 

I didn't want to rain on her excitement, and today my parents came over and she mentioned the plans and said it's them three doing it but I'm not involved. I, again, didn't want to put her on the spot (especially in front of my parents), so I stayed quiet. It's been bugging me since. I don't think she is consciously excluding me, but how do I bring up that I feel excluded without her feeling guilty?  I'm not even sure I want to be part of it now because if I bring it up and how I feel, she's going to realize how she was acting and tell me I'm able to be involved, but I wanted her to want me to be involved. 

It'll be us buying the equipment, cabinets/counters (I even told her, before she said I wasn't involved, that I know carpenters that could help build stuff to redo the shop. Her cookie business isn't even out of the red yet, but it will be, so it's my savings that is supporting this. ",3,1734578987.0,Marriage,6,1.0,False

I‚Äôm sorry for loving and caring about you more profoundly than anyone else in your life ever has.

I‚Äôm sorry for the understanding I showed during the many times suspicions arose, suspicions I never voiced, though perhaps I should have. 

I‚Äôm sorry for not confronting you when anyone else, regardless of gender or identity, might have demanded answers. 

I‚Äôm sorry for holding your hair back, rubbing your back while you were sick, taking care of you so tenderly in those vulnerable moments.

I‚Äôm sorry for taking on the role of caregiver, for buying your prescriptions, your groceries, and covering the cost of every meal, every coffee. 

I‚Äôm sorry for opening doors for you felt you like a gentleman, and using constant manners‚Äî‚Äúyes, please‚Äù and ‚Äúno thank you.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sorry for being a gentleman in general.

I‚Äôm sorry for absorbing the hurtful words you threw my way, each one like a shard of glass, cutting deep‚Äî‚Äúdon‚Äôt ever fucking talk to me again,‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôre fucking done,‚Äù ‚ÄúI fucking hate you,‚Äù ‚Äúyou fucking bitch,‚Äù ‚Äúyou entitled piece of shit.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt endure more instead of expressing how your hurtful  words and diatribe‚Äôs inflicted wounds and subsequent scars. 

I‚Äôm sorry for always treating your family and friends with kindness, respect, and genuine interest. For the hours I spent making your condo spotless, every corner, every room‚Äîeven the toilets and beneath your bed where dust and hair collected over years of neglect. 

I‚Äôm sorry for standing up for you to others, going as far as filing a police report to ensure your safety when you felt threatened, or paranoid by a homeless man who never once approached or spoke to you.

I‚Äôm sorry for crafting surprise dates and for uttering words that moved you to tears, words that touched you in ways I never imagined possible. 

I‚Äôm sorry for singing to you, for the times we harmonized or when you broke down over songs your father loved, without me knowing their significant.

I‚Äôm sorry I called you the missing price to my puzzle.

I‚Äôm sorry that I dedicated Songbird by Fleetwood Mac to you and you got emotional because your father loved that song but also would play it for you when you were a kid. I‚Äôm sorry you never shared this with me, but I‚Äôm sorry I reminded you of your father. 

I‚Äôm sorry I was the man you said your deceased father would have adored. 

Im sorry for getting pet insurance for your dog, for ensuring she was well-cared for with new food and vet visits. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the one time I forgot my wallet after a vet visit, prompting you to call me cheap‚ÄîI never intended to upset you. I‚Äôm sorry you were so angry after that. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the weekly  journeys I made by train and bus, traveling to be with you every Thursday through Sunday, sacrificing my time and comfort.

I‚Äôm sorry for never questioning the absence of photos from your ‚Äúgirls trips‚Äù and for being subjected to your anger each time I asked about friends whose names I never learned.

I‚Äôm sorry you chose baby names and pressured me into having sex with you in order to potentially get you pregnant, even though I wasn‚Äôt ready because it was still early on, and because we needed to figure a lot out still for me to be in a place where I felt we were both ready for that. Actually‚Ä¶ I did, several times. I even ensured I didn‚Äôt finish inside of you because my boundaries were routinely being crossed, and you continued.

I‚Äôm sorry for performing oral on you when you would demand and curse at me to do so explicitly. Do you  Remember when you bragged about demanding it later that one day before the Halloween party? I‚Äôm sorry you shared that with me. 

I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt  get you pregnant, even though you weren‚Äôt ready to be a mother. I‚Äôm sorry you still had to confront your reality and the truth of your reality before bringing a child into the world. 

I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt get you pregnant while there were disturbing things occurring behind my back during the entire duration of our relationship, and bringing a child into that situation would‚Äôve been disturbing. I‚Äôm sorry I felt that way. 

I‚Äôm sorry that when you would grab my hips and pull me in closer while I was finishing, even as I physically resisted, all while telling me to ‚Äúget you pregnant‚Äù and to ‚Äúfill you up.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sorry you had a manic look in your eyes when you would do that every time we had sex after the first month or dating and until the implosion‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sorry for feeling powerless in those moments, for not knowing how to assert myself by telling you what tou were doing frightened me.

I‚Äôm sorry for not giving in towards the end of us, to your physical force which you would use with me inn during  these moments.  I was scared of you , and for how deeply that crossed my boundaries.

I‚Äôm sorry that you didn‚Äôt get pregnant and therefore couldn‚Äôt get out of the things you were doing behind my back, or the life you were secretly leading, Heisenberg. 

I‚Äôm sorry you weren‚Äôt honest with me. I would‚Äôve rescued you from that life.

I‚Äôm sorry that I could have financially took care of you forever, and protected you forever as I promised I would‚Äôve. 

I‚Äôm sorry you picked lonely old men and their money, to fake attraction and relationships, even love with them. 

I‚Äôm sorry that the money you make doing this doesn‚Äôt change how alone and lonely you‚Äôve been and you‚Äôll always be? Who knows‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sorry that when you talked about and would plan our future, you beamed with a smile that could light up the world, dreaming of beating your sister to the altar or into motherhood. I‚Äôm sorry for how much of a savage your sister is. I‚Äôm sorry how horrible the relationship is and always will be between the two of you. 

I‚Äôm sorry for discussing marriage and homes in neighborhoods where you wanted to live, even though my job was an hour away. 

I‚Äôm sorry I put an offer on one of those eight million dollar homes two days before it all imploded.

I‚Äôm sorry I purchased one to the Tiffany engagement rings that you loved. Remember? During the second weekend we were together? we went to Tiffany‚Äôs, and I wrote down your favourite engagement rings. I always kept that piece of paper for a reason. 

I‚Äôm sorry I bought it and planned the proposal that never happened. 

I‚Äôm sorry for inquiring about your ‚Äúbusiness,‚Äù offering help with marketing, using my MBA and business acumen to support you, only to be met with evasion and silence. I‚Äôm sorry for questioning the lack of social media updates for two years for your ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry you were reluctant to speak of clients. Even when I just asked how work was going.

I‚Äôm sorry for being okay when you brushed me off after my aunt passed, for respecting your busy schedule over my grief. 

I‚Äôm sorry for always valuing your feelings, your emotions, even when they were wielded like weapons against me‚ÄîI‚Äôm not a fighter, except when it comes to defending my heart.

I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt have more time to manipulate, gaslight, and abuse me. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the way your life is built on lies and deceit, for cheating on someone who loved you more than you could comprehend, all while living a double life and lying to everyone in their life, all while being workings as an escort. 

I‚Äôm sorry you lied prior to us even meeting. 

I‚Äôm sorry you posed as someone you weren‚Äôt seeking a long term relationship on Hinge. 

I‚Äôm sorry you never were honest with me because I would‚Äôve asked you to quit, not have been made by your cheating, and we could‚Äôve moved on by having and fulfilling the dreams we constantly discussed, which you always initiated even. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you weren‚Äôt more creative with your front for a career and small business. 

I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt ask you more about the ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù you would constantly or randomly have and I would get upset despite never meeting them or knowing their names, or anything about them.

I‚Äôm sorry most of them likely wear elderly diapers, and have grey public hair. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you would get upset for me asking any further questions about your ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù after you brought the buddies (lol the word gets me still). 

I‚Äôm sorry that you would have likely have to change their diapers, and honestly, you should have just became a nurse instead.

I‚Äôm sorry for the marriages you destroyed and the children left without a father. Did that make you feel better for the tragic loss of your father? 

Im sorry that while on the phone, you threatened to jump off your balcony, and then left me on the other end, as you opened your balcony door, and I cried, begged, pleaded for you to be okay and not hurt herself for eight minutes that were the scariest eight fucking minutes of my life.

I‚Äôm sorry that when I threatened to call the police, you finally came back to the phone and pretended that you never threatened to jump off your balcony.

I‚Äôm sorry you accused me of wanting you to get better. I‚Äôm sorry you accused me of ‚Äúwanting you committed‚Äù, even though that wasn‚Äôt true and you never were committed, nor did anyone ever approach you about committing yourself. 

I‚Äôm sorry for you creating random fights between us, somehow making them my fault, and for me giving in and apologizing afterwards despite you conjuring these random fights to create space for a couple days between us so you could hang out with your buddies and get paid I suppose? I‚Äôm sorry for what they likely did to you.. I‚Äôm sorry there‚Äôs reviews online about your performance.

I‚Äôm sorry about one reviewer detailing how you were in bed with them three days after my birthday. 

I‚Äôm sorry that I would‚Äôve given you the financial freedom and wealth in addition to ensuring that you were the happiest woman to ever take a single breath on this earth. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you decided being an escort and being paid by lonely men was more important than what we had built and what you had told me you wanted for your life with me‚Ä¶ our life. 

I‚Äôm sorry that confronting you after being sent confirmation of who you really were randomly one morning.

I‚Äôm sorry that I always hoped, and fucking wished it was just a suspicion and I‚Äôm sorry for keeping it to myself without being resentful either. 

I‚Äôm sorry your sister had the same suspicions two years prior and you slapped her across the face for ‚Äúeven insinuating I would be a fucking hooker, a whore, or an escort‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm sorry that me knowing made you anxious because of your unwillingness to ever get help for your anxiety and paranoids.

I‚Äôm sorry your feared your sister‚Äôs judgment, even though your sister abuses her fianc√© daily and hasn‚Äôt even shown a person, or even her dog an ounce of kindness for even one second of her life. 

I‚Äôm sorry you put her potentially finding out even though she wouldn‚Äôt have, over the person who loved you more than any family, friend, ex boyfriend or girlfriend..: and buddy! Ever has or ever would have.

I‚Äôm sorry your sister will have to wait a little longer before she finds out the truth.

 I‚Äôm sorry for your loss false, horrific, disgusting, and appalling false accusations against me, which l led to me being arrested because I knew the truth.

I‚Äôm sorry you pretended to love me you went as far as to not only blanatntly lie  because as you would say, ‚Äúno one will ever believe a man could be abused by a woman. 

I‚Äôm sorry you use this twisted mentality twice against me just because you broke my heart and cheated on me for a year, all just to silence me not just from your abuse, but for your disaster of a sister not kicking you outbid her wedding party and disowning you for life.

I‚Äôm sorry she will regardless, because she‚Äôs an evil and jealous person.  

I‚Äôm sorry that I wrote these letters in my mind for each of the two 25 hour stints in jail, which caused me having uproot my life, forget what privacy is, ever think about romance and the learning the concept of trust is a waste of time and no one should or can be trusted again. 

I‚Äôm sorry you taught me that everyone‚Äôs actually evil.

I‚Äôm sorry I never crossed any boundaries with you of any kind, and I have all your texts that contradict your allegations. I‚Äôm sorry these texts also explicitly show that you were the blanat abuser in every manner‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry you won‚Äôt be coming up with these letters, or anything creative while you spend a large part of the rest of your life behind bars. I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre not creative, emotionally available, or charismatic enough for people to care about whatever you may have to say about a tik tok video you saw before you went to prison. 

I‚Äôm sorry you never became the influencer you thought you could be despite not having anything to say or interesting character traits that anyone would care about. I‚Äôm sorry you thought this was possible despite your regular eight likes on tik tok. 

I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt want to break bail again and spend the holidays and beyond, in a jail cell, while I‚Äôm still in a mental prison without physically being in a jail or prison cell.

I‚Äôm sorry you wore my clothes in a TikTok shortly after my first arrest and flaunted your life as if my world hadn‚Äôt shattered. Im sorry how un-credible of a witness you won‚Äôt ever get a chance to be‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry we didn‚Äôt meet years earlier, when we lived across the street, shopped at the same stores, banked at the same place, walked our dogs in the same neighborhood. I wish I could have steered you away from the path you chose, even though I didn‚Äôt know you then.

I would‚Äôve saved and protected you. I would‚Äôve never left‚Ä¶ ever.

I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt apologize when I confronted you upon finding out the day before I confronted you.

I‚Äôm sorry you sought out killing me and attempting to ruin my life as a better alternative.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù‚Ä¶ the words you believe every one, even people you‚Äôve never met and won‚Äôt ever meet owe you for reasons that you don‚Äôt even understand. 

You‚Äôre not the victim of any previous, current and future delusion. 

No one owes you as many sorry‚Äôs as you believe that all eight billion people on earth owe you.

You need to learn how to apologize to yourself first, for the people you‚Äôve literally killed and hurt, shattered, torn apart, cheated on, and discarded them like the gunk stuck to your shitty samba‚Äôs a 75 year old paraplegic likely got you after you gave them a happy ending. 

Apologize to your family for your lies of a decade or longer, apologize to your sister for assaulting her, to the mother you abandoned and blocked, all while leaving her with an apparent abuser (your words). 

You won‚Äôt. Or maybe‚Ä¶ fuck me‚Ä¶ fuck me for believing that you want to scream into the void because you‚Äôre fully aware of the damage you‚Äôve caused throughout your adult life to everyone you‚Äôve crossed paths with, and an amazing person is there. I saw her many times and I wanted to fucking hug you to through FaceTime the night before we last spoke because I saw a person who was destroyed, and desperately hurting because of the secret they harboured, and perhaps the dangerous, and evil people within their orbit who they wished died so you could live without fear any longer and be your true, loving, amazing, and strong individual that you truly fucking are.

Despite everything, you remain a beautiful person, inside and out. I see the good in you, the potential for happiness and health, if only you hadn‚Äôt destroyed what we had. Your father would want you to be okay.

I remember the night you asked me to promise to always protect you and never leave, and how I held you as tears streamed down my face.

In that embrace, I felt your anxiety, your fear, your loneliness, and I promised to always love you, more than all the galaxies out there, even those that haven‚Äôt been discovered yet. 

‚ÄúMore than the aliens?‚Äù you asked, our little joke. Yes, more than those aliens you adore. ‚ÄúI love you, and I‚Äôll love you forever. I‚Äôll never let you go.

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for still loving you and believing in you, and my fucking heart. 

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for the moment I finally get to tell you how much I love you again. 

I‚Äôm NOT and how I told you that I would always protect you, even after everything that you‚Äôve done. 

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for abandoning you like everyone else has throughout your life. 

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for saving you and showing you how beautiful life can be, or for teaching you that  every day doesn‚Äôt have to be dark like Alaska. 

You‚Äôre beyond worthy of your yellow brick road.

I can‚Äôt express how much fun it was getting to know her better, and had a great time talking about nostalgic television, horror movies, and more. Her Sons of the Forest tips in particular were very useful for my own playthrough :)

[such a cute card on first opening the box!](https://preview.redd.it/ythjjo115q7e1.jpg?width=3724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd6df48cbc8e41d975174cb14a35e97dcbb07714)

She included a Book of Smells guide (hehe Gravity Falls reference) detailing each scent she picked for me and why, as well as those that didn‚Äôt make the cut, which provided a very insightful look into her thought process! It was also soaked in coffee/wrinkled to give it an old time look and really makes me feel like I have some powerful scrolls on my hands!

Hallieus was soooo generous with extras as well. I can‚Äôt express how impressed I am with her sticker sourcing skills! The lenticular bat potion is one of my faves (can‚Äôt stop rotating it), and she captured my aesthetic (horror + cute + whimsical + goblin) sooo well! I love how the extras encapsulated a lot of the media we discussed together, like Over the Garden Wall, Coraline, Gravity Falls, Twin Peaks (the decals on the perfume tin!! wow!!), and more!

The perfumes she picked were also so well chosen! Many things I wanted to try, others that I didn‚Äôt know I even needed! Like how did she find TWO melon scents that I hadn‚Äôt heard of before for me (the melon monster) ! She showed such thoughtfulness with each choice, and I‚Äôm really looking forward to testing these out.

I received the following scents:

* **Andromeda‚Äôs Curse** *Baby Bat*, *Beast of Blood*, and *Jupiter*
* Freebies of **BPAL** *Cat Sitting on a Cushion Licking Its Paw*, *Wrapped in Sable Garments*, *White Sandalwood & Honey Cream*, and *Raminou*
* **Exuma Fragrance Co** *Summer Dew* and *Lilas*
* **Ghoulish Goods Custom** *Fruit Bats* and *Moth Milk*, with a freebie of *Cathedral*
* **Nui Cobalt Designs** *Playing Hooky*
* **Possets** freebies of *Allen Ginsberg Howl*, *Dies Irae*, and *The Mistress of Power*
* **Pulp Fragrance** *Ghostwood Forest* and *Portrait of Josette*
* **Tater Rounds Beauty** *Bedelia* and *Space Melon*!

I also received:

* A HUGE number of tea and spice samples, some in real cool tins! I‚Äôm looking forward to trying the White Melon White Tea and Ancient Beauty Oolong Tea especially, and cooking with the Kiawe Smoked Salt!
* Candy, such as Zombie Sour Patch Kids, Kasugai Melon Jelly Beans (as a melon fan I‚Äôm winning so hard right now), and Tandy Mellow Melons (which I have never tried before but am very intrigued by!)
* A halloweenie cookie house kit! My cookie house will be the scariest in the town of gingerbread houses
* Mystery Shack Knicknacks
* Twin Peaks path and keychain! (Goes with Pulp Ghostwood Forest!)
* Coraline themed doll & button key pin, seeing stone, and jumping mice washi tape!
* Stationery such as a bookmark, mollusk notepad (captured whimsical goblin perfectly!), a flowering skull pen, and lots of stickers!
* A cute ghost plush keychain, a glow in the dark ghost-in-a-bottle necklace, enamel pins, and a cute monster phone charm! Loved all the Halloween theming on this!

I‚Äôm sorry for singing to you, for the times we harmonized or when you broke down over songs your father loved, without me knowing their significant.

I‚Äôm sorry I called you the missing price to my puzzle.

I‚Äôm sorry that I dedicated Songbird by Fleetwood Mac to you and you got emotional because your father loved that song but also would play it for you when you were a kid. I‚Äôm sorry you never shared this with me, but I‚Äôm sorry I reminded you of your father. 

I‚Äôm sorry I was the man you said your deceased father would have adored. 

Im sorry for getting pet insurance for your dog, for ensuring she was well-cared for with new food and vet visits. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the one time I forgot my wallet after a vet visit, prompting you to call me cheap‚ÄîI never intended to upset you. I‚Äôm sorry you were so angry after that. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the weekly  journeys I made by train and bus, traveling to be with you every Thursday through Sunday, sacrificing my time and comfort.

I‚Äôm sorry for never questioning the absence of photos from your ‚Äúgirls trips‚Äù and for being subjected to your anger each time I asked about friends whose names I never learned.

I‚Äôm sorry you chose baby names and pressured me into having sex with you in order to potentially get you pregnant, even though I wasn‚Äôt ready because it was still early on, and because we needed to figure a lot out still for me to be in a place where I felt we were both ready for that. Actually‚Ä¶ I did, several times. I even ensured I didn‚Äôt finish inside of you because my boundaries were routinely being crossed, and you continued.

I‚Äôm sorry for performing oral on you when you would demand and curse at me to do so explicitly. Do you  Remember when you bragged about demanding it later that one day before the Halloween party? I‚Äôm sorry you shared that with me. 

I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt  get you pregnant, even though you weren‚Äôt ready to be a mother. I‚Äôm sorry you still had to confront your reality and the truth of your reality before bringing a child into the world. 

I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt get you pregnant while there were disturbing things occurring behind my back during the entire duration of our relationship, and bringing a child into that situation would‚Äôve been disturbing. I‚Äôm sorry I felt that way. 

I‚Äôm sorry that when you would grab my hips and pull me in closer while I was finishing, even as I physically resisted, all while telling me to ‚Äúget you pregnant‚Äù and to ‚Äúfill you up.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sorry you had a manic look in your eyes when you would do that every time we had sex after the first month or dating and until the implosion‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sorry for feeling powerless in those moments, for not knowing how to assert myself by telling you what tou were doing frightened me.

I‚Äôm sorry for not giving in towards the end of us, to your physical force which you would use with me inn during  these moments.  I was scared of you , and for how deeply that crossed my boundaries.

I‚Äôm sorry that you didn‚Äôt get pregnant and therefore couldn‚Äôt get out of the things you were doing behind my back, or the life you were secretly leading, Heisenberg. 

I‚Äôm sorry you weren‚Äôt honest with me. I would‚Äôve rescued you from that life.

I‚Äôm sorry that I could have financially took care of you forever, and protected you forever as I promised I would‚Äôve. 

I‚Äôm sorry you picked lonely old men and their money, to fake attraction and relationships, even love with them. 

I‚Äôm sorry that the money you make doing this doesn‚Äôt change how alone and lonely you‚Äôve been and you‚Äôll always be? Who knows‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sorry that when you talked about and would plan our future, you beamed with a smile that could light up the world, dreaming of beating your sister to the altar or into motherhood. I‚Äôm sorry for how much of a savage your sister is. I‚Äôm sorry how horrible the relationship is and always will be between the two of you. 

I‚Äôm sorry for discussing marriage and homes in neighborhoods where you wanted to live, even though my job was an hour away. 

I‚Äôm sorry I put an offer on one of those eight million dollar homes two days before it all imploded.

I‚Äôm sorry I purchased one to the Tiffany engagement rings that you loved. Remember? During the second weekend we were together? we went to Tiffany‚Äôs, and I wrote down your favourite engagement rings. I always kept that piece of paper for a reason. 

I‚Äôm sorry I bought it and planned the proposal that never happened. 

I‚Äôm sorry for inquiring about your ‚Äúbusiness,‚Äù offering help with marketing, using my MBA and business acumen to support you, only to be met with evasion and silence. I‚Äôm sorry for questioning the lack of social media updates for two years for your ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry you were reluctant to speak of clients. Even when I just asked how work was going.

I‚Äôm sorry for being okay when you brushed me off after my aunt passed, for respecting your busy schedule over my grief. 

I‚Äôm sorry for always valuing your feelings, your emotions, even when they were wielded like weapons against me‚ÄîI‚Äôm not a fighter, except when it comes to defending my heart.

I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt have more time to manipulate, gaslight, and abuse me. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the way your life is built on lies and deceit, for cheating on someone who loved you more than you could comprehend, all while living a double life and lying to everyone in their life, all while being workings as an escort. 

I‚Äôm sorry you lied prior to us even meeting. 

I‚Äôm sorry you posed as someone you weren‚Äôt seeking a long term relationship on Hinge. 

I‚Äôm sorry you never were honest with me because I would‚Äôve asked you to quit, not have been made by your cheating, and we could‚Äôve moved on by having and fulfilling the dreams we constantly discussed, which you always initiated even. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you weren‚Äôt more creative with your front for a career and small business. 

I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt ask you more about the ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù you would constantly or randomly have and I would get upset despite never meeting them or knowing their names, or anything about them.

I‚Äôm sorry most of them likely wear elderly diapers, and have grey public hair. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you would get upset for me asking any further questions about your ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù after you brought the buddies (lol the word gets me still). 

I‚Äôm sorry that you would have likely have to change their diapers, and honestly, you should have just became a nurse instead.

I‚Äôm sorry for the marriages you destroyed and the children left without a father. Did that make you feel better for the tragic loss of your father? 

Im sorry that while on the phone, you threatened to jump off your balcony, and then left me on the other end, as you opened your balcony door, and I cried, begged, pleaded for you to be okay and not hurt herself for eight minutes that were the scariest eight fucking minutes of my life.

I‚Äôm sorry that when I threatened to call the police, you finally came back to the phone and pretended that you never threatened to jump off your balcony.

I‚Äôm sorry you accused me of wanting you to get better. I‚Äôm sorry you accused me of ‚Äúwanting you committed‚Äù, even though that wasn‚Äôt true and you never were committed, nor did anyone ever approach you about committing yourself. 

I‚Äôm sorry for you creating random fights between us, somehow making them my fault, and for me giving in and apologizing afterwards despite you conjuring these random fights to create space for a couple days between us so you could hang out with your buddies and get paid I suppose? I‚Äôm sorry for what they likely did to you.. I‚Äôm sorry there‚Äôs reviews online about your performance.

I‚Äôm sorry about one reviewer detailing how you were in bed with them three days after my birthday. 

I‚Äôm sorry that I would‚Äôve given you the financial freedom and wealth in addition to ensuring that you were the happiest woman to ever take a single breath on this earth. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you decided being an escort and being paid by lonely men was more important than what we had built and what you had told me you wanted for your life with me‚Ä¶ our life. 

I‚Äôm sorry that confronting you after being sent confirmation of who you really were randomly one morning.

I‚Äôm sorry that I always hoped, and fucking wished it was just a suspicion and I‚Äôm sorry for keeping it to myself without being resentful either. 

I‚Äôm sorry your sister had the same suspicions two years prior and you slapped her across the face for ‚Äúeven insinuating I would be a fucking hooker, a whore, or an escort‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm sorry that me knowing made you anxious because of your unwillingness to ever get help for your anxiety and paranoids.

I‚Äôm sorry your feared your sister‚Äôs judgment, even though your sister abuses her fianc√© daily and hasn‚Äôt even shown a person, or even her dog an ounce of kindness for even one second of her life. 

I‚Äôm sorry you put her potentially finding out even though she wouldn‚Äôt have, over the person who loved you more than any family, friend, ex boyfriend or girlfriend..: and buddy! Ever has or ever would have.

I‚Äôm sorry your sister will have to wait a little longer before she finds out the truth.

 I‚Äôm sorry for your loss false, horrific, disgusting, and appalling false accusations against me, which l led to me being arrested because I knew the truth.

I‚Äôm sorry you pretended to love me you went as far as to not only blanatntly lie  because as you would say, ‚Äúno one will ever believe a man could be abused by a woman. 

I‚Äôm sorry you use this twisted mentality twice against me just because you broke my heart and cheated on me for a year, all just to silence me not just from your abuse, but for your disaster of a sister not kicking you outbid her wedding party and disowning you for life.

I‚Äôm sorry she will regardless, because she‚Äôs an evil and jealous person.  

I‚Äôm sorry that I wrote these letters in my mind for each of the two 25 hour stints in jail, which caused me having uproot my life, forget what privacy is, ever think about romance and the learning the concept of trust is a waste of time and no one should or can be trusted again. 

I‚Äôm sorry you taught me that everyone‚Äôs actually evil.

I‚Äôm sorry I never crossed any boundaries with you of any kind, and I have all your texts that contradict your allegations. I‚Äôm sorry these texts also explicitly show that you were the blanat abuser in every manner‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry you won‚Äôt be coming up with these letters, or anything creative while you spend a large part of the rest of your life behind bars. I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre not creative, emotionally available, or charismatic enough for people to care about whatever you may have to say about a tik tok video you saw before you went to prison. 

I‚Äôm sorry you never became the influencer you thought you could be despite not having anything to say or interesting character traits that anyone would care about. I‚Äôm sorry you thought this was possible despite your regular eight likes on tik tok. 

I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt want to break bail again and spend the holidays and beyond, in a jail cell, while I‚Äôm still in a mental prison without physically being in a jail or prison cell.

I‚Äôm sorry you wore my clothes in a TikTok shortly after my first arrest and flaunted your life as if my world hadn‚Äôt shattered. Im sorry how un-credible of a witness you won‚Äôt ever get a chance to be‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry we didn‚Äôt meet years earlier, when we lived across the street, shopped at the same stores, banked at the same place, walked our dogs in the same neighborhood. I wish I could have steered you away from the path you chose, even though I didn‚Äôt know you then.

I would‚Äôve saved and protected you. I would‚Äôve never left‚Ä¶ ever.

I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt apologize when I confronted you upon finding out the day before I confronted you.

I‚Äôm sorry you sought out killing me and attempting to ruin my life as a better alternative.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù‚Ä¶ the words you believe every one, even people you‚Äôve never met and won‚Äôt ever meet owe you for reasons that you don‚Äôt even understand. 

You‚Äôre not the victim of any previous, current and future delusion. 

No one owes you as many sorry‚Äôs as you believe that all eight billion people on earth owe you.

You need to learn how to apologize to yourself first, for the people you‚Äôve literally killed and hurt, shattered, torn apart, cheated on, and discarded them like the gunk stuck to your shitty samba‚Äôs a 75 year old paraplegic likely got you after you gave them a happy ending. 

Apologize to your family for your lies of a decade or longer, apologize to your sister for assaulting her, to the mother you abandoned and blocked, all while leaving her with an apparent abuser (your words). 

You won‚Äôt. Or maybe‚Ä¶ fuck me‚Ä¶ fuck me for believing that you want to scream into the void because you‚Äôre fully aware of the damage you‚Äôve caused throughout your adult life to everyone you‚Äôve crossed paths with, and an amazing person is there. I saw her many times and I wanted to fucking hug you to through FaceTime the night before we last spoke because I saw a person who was destroyed, and desperately hurting because of the secret they harboured, and perhaps the dangerous, and evil people within their orbit who they wished died so you could live without fear any longer and be your true, loving, amazing, and strong individual that you truly fucking are.

Despite everything, you remain a beautiful person, inside and out. I see the good in you, the potential for happiness and health, if only you hadn‚Äôt destroyed what we had. Your father would want you to be okay.

I remember the night you asked me to promise to always protect you and never leave, and how I held you as tears streamed down my face.

In that embrace, I felt your anxiety, your fear, your loneliness, and I promised to always love you, more than all the galaxies out there, even those that haven‚Äôt been discovered yet. 

‚ÄúMore than the aliens?‚Äù you asked, our little joke. Yes, more than those aliens you adore. ‚ÄúI love you, and I‚Äôll love you forever. I‚Äôll never let you go.

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for still loving you and believing in you, and my fucking heart. 

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for the moment I finally get to tell you how much I love you again. 

I‚Äôm NOT and how I told you that I would always protect you, even after everything that you‚Äôve done. 

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for abandoning you like everyone else has throughout your life. 

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for saving you and showing you how beautiful life can be, or for teaching you that  every day doesn‚Äôt have to be dark like Alaska. 

You‚Äôre beyond worthy of your yellow brick road.

My friend went on a very good date a month ago. She said they had an amazing time and connection seemed very mutual. Since then, they have planned several dates which have all fallen through for various reasons all because he‚Äôs cancelled. She was supposed to see him this week but he has a work conflict come up.

1hhjowt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hhjowt,I let in an assumed lost/stray cat and ended up with his kitten,"A month ago, my dad came by the house to drop something off. We had just moved in a week before.

He was leaving and as he stepped out of the door, he almost stepped on a white cat. I didn't let it in, as I'm allergic.

Ended up going back to the living room and then saw it with the corner of my eye scaling my backyard fence. We live in a row townhome and we're in the middle.

I opened the backyard door and he ran on in. It was colder that day, below freezing overnight for one of the first times this season (winter is late).

Ended up waiting for my wife to come home as I made a post here https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/s/BSs5FI8xd3 and in local FB groups, hoping to find the owner.

Male intact cat, no tags. Seemed to be deaf but I'm no professional. We took him to the vet to scan for a chip, no success.

We bought a litter box, water and food bowl, and the vet gave some wet food to get by.

Two days pass and no hits on the cat. We saw in the area the same cat has been wandering around and spotted multiple times over the month. One post said was a neighborhood cat who's allowed to roam, but this person never replied to my messages regarding possible owner.

Not going to lie, we were hoping it had no owner. He was a real nice boy and I learned I could ""tolerate"" the allergies.

We were doing our due diligence, without getting hopes up. On the third day, we printed out papers and placed them on the community mailbox. That night, the owner messaged me. They lived on the street we suspected the cat to be from based on the previous spottings, and we took a quick stroll, devasted, to return the cat.

The owners were thankful for us for taking care of their cat, and invited us in for some coffee and tea. Before entering, they said, ""we have kittens"". I looked at my wife like üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄ and we went in and chatted for a couple of hours and met our future boy, Cloud, one of the runaway's sons.

It's been almost a month now (he just turned 11 weeks). When he's behaving he's amazing, but he can also be an absolute terror. Unfortunately can't take two cats, not yet anyways. Trying to figure out one as this is our first pet ever. But no regrets in taking in that random cat, none at all.

1hhjmgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Homestead_Veteran/comments/1hhjmgo/about_me/,About Me,"I am a calm, intelligent, and patient man.  Calm because I have experience handling stressful situations; intelligent because I am a keen observer, an active learner and critical thinker.  Patient, because I am well practiced in teaching others and know that everyone learns in different ways and at a different pace.

My quiet nature belies my leadership abilities, forged while under fire, and hardened by seemingly insurmountable difficulties.  I am soft-spoken, but do not mistake that for a lack of confidence: mature leadership does not need to be loud; it merely needs to be decisive and firm.  I handle criticism well, so long as it‚Äôs tactful and constructive.  The world will always try to tear us down, and there is no reason for us to help it.   

I am an ISTJ, thus I am direct in my communications with others.  I am logical and analytical, and rely on those skills to make solid and successful decisions.  This also means I am stubborn - and while some may see that as a weakness, I see it as a strength; I am always pressing forward in the face of adversity, searching for alternate solutions, and never giving up until my goal has been achieved.  I don‚Äôt cave to social pressure if it‚Äôs not the right decision; I believe integrity is paramount and strive to do the right thing at the right time, even when no one is looking.

This has lead me to where I am now - a man with multiple achievements in a handful of careers, culminating in an impressive and eccentric r√©sum√©.  I am not the type of man who snoozes his alarm.  I am up, awake, and engaged (after coffee).  My successes have set me up for an early retirement within the next ~10 years, at which point I should have accumulated well into the mid-7 to low-8 figure range.

I make well into the 6-figure range, so there is plenty of financial leeway for me to pursue the ultimate dream: homesteading / hobby farming on my land in the northwestern MT Rockies.  

The land there is remote and with 610 acres there is plenty of room to recuperate from the stresses of life.  No better peace can be found.  At 7 miles deep, the homestead is surrounded by thousands of untouched acres.  The mountainsides are dotted with huckleberry and red currant bushes.  The smell of fir and spruce rides along Spring breezes, while deer and elk bring their fawns and calves to graze on the tender, young shoots in the meadows.  In the Summer, the hares nibble on the wild strawberries that line the road.  As the temperature breaks, the tamarack turns bright yellow from the top down, competing against the maples and aspen for the title of ‚Äúmost colorful.‚Äù  Winter brings with it a quiet stillness in the air, as the soft snow sits heavy on the evergreens‚Äô bending boughs.  But the we will make the home warm and inviting - always beckoning us back.

This lifestyle is physical, and thus we must be physically prepared to overcome the challenges it presents.  My fitness level is in the top 30% for age and gender; I will lead our family by setting the example.  I don‚Äôt use drugs, and rarely drink.  My vice is smoking cigars on my porch in my free time.

I am a spiritual Christian who has found his own path.  Where there is man, there is sin, so I find the dogma of church to be both unnecessary and an impediment to my relationship with God.  

I protect what I love by financially ensuring our family is safe and comfortable, well educated, and healthy; by properly leading us through individual or family tribulations and navigating life‚Äôs many twisted roads; and - if necessary - physically protecting us from potential local or global threats - whatever form they may come in.  I was born a warrior, and I will die a warrior; it was my profession for many years, and I have the markings to prove it.  My goal is to live peacefully, and provide a warm, safe space for our family to thrive.  But make no mistake: I will gladly bring war to the doorstep of any adversary in any form that is required.

Politically, I am right-leaning and imbued with conservative values.  I would describe myself as a cross between the Constitution party, and Libertarian party.  I believe our society is blind to the decay or our basic Constitutional rights, and I believe this is by design.

I may be reserved, but after I get to know you, you will see my dry wit emerge.  I have a dark, blunt sense of humor and will keep us laughing.

I value privacy, and detest modern social media.  I see no redeeming value, although modern life almost demands it.  I long for a simpler time when humans connected through meaningful communication, and want to make lasting memories.

I believe a strong couple is the result of passionate intimacy on a regular basis.  I am open minded, kink and fetish friendly, and have experience in many aspects of sex, which can be discussed in due time.  I have a strong libido and need a partner who can match my interests and desire.  I generally prefer someone less experienced because I do enjoy the journey of teaching and exploring intimacy with my partner.

I‚Äôm divorced, and happy to discuss it.  I have two children who stay with me frequently, and open to more under the right circumstances.  I value family, and believe that corporate profit does what it can to fray the family fabric.  It‚Äôs important to me that we cherish the time we have together, and are present in the moment.  I seek a fulfilling marriage and need the right woman to be by my side.  I can conquer the world with one hand, so long as you are holding the other.  I will live every day striving to earn your love and respect, and I will choose to love you every day.

To then being accepted into the Doctoral program the same week of the semester ending, I decided it was time for me to really step up my coffee game. 

I had originally bought an Ode 2 from Crate and Barrel on Black Friday weekend (but in store on Sunday). I had gotten home thrilled to get it set up so I could finally play around with and use my new Mocca. Upon opening it though, I found it had been used. Coffee grinds all over and inside the machine. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. 

In my disappointment (and rage), I did some research and settled on trying the KitchenAid. I have no idea how this will go as I rarely see posts with this grinder, but such is life and I will figure it out!

I am beyond excited for this new coffee adventure! I hope this lasts me  years to come. ",12,1734577691.0,Moccamaster,4,1.0,False

I‚Äôm sorry for loving and caring about you more profoundly than anyone else in your life ever has. 

I‚Äôm sorry for being the one who would drop everything in an instant whenever you needed me, or whenever you were in distress, without a second thought. 

I‚Äôm sorry for treating your dog as if they were our child, nurturing them through illness with the same dedication I offered you.

I‚Äôm sorry for the understanding I showed during the many times suspicions arose, suspicions I never voiced, though perhaps I should have. 

I‚Äôm sorry for not confronting you when anyone else, regardless of gender or identity, might have demanded answers. 

I‚Äôm sorry for holding your hair back, rubbing your back while you were sick, taking care of you so tenderly in those vulnerable moments.

I‚Äôm sorry for taking on the role of caregiver, for buying your prescriptions, your groceries, and covering the cost of every meal, every coffee. 

I‚Äôm sorry for opening doors for you felt you like a gentleman, and using constant manners‚Äî‚Äúyes, please‚Äù and ‚Äúno thank you.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sorry for being a gentleman in general.

I‚Äôm sorry for absorbing the hurtful words you threw my way, each one like a shard of glass, cutting deep‚Äî‚Äúdon‚Äôt ever fucking talk to me again,‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôre fucking done,‚Äù ‚ÄúI fucking hate you,‚Äù ‚Äúyou fucking bitch,‚Äù ‚Äúyou entitled piece of shit.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt endure more instead of expressing how your hurtful  words and diatribe‚Äôs inflicted wounds and subsequent scars. 

I‚Äôm sorry for always treating your family and friends with kindness, respect, and genuine interest. For the hours I spent making your condo spotless, every corner, every room‚Äîeven the toilets and beneath your bed where dust and hair collected over years of neglect. 

I‚Äôm sorry for standing up for you to others, going as far as filing a police report to ensure your safety when you felt threatened, or paranoid by a homeless man who never once approached or spoke to you.

I‚Äôm sorry for crafting surprise dates and for uttering words that moved you to tears, words that touched you in ways I never imagined possible. 

I‚Äôm sorry for singing to you, for the times we harmonized or when you broke down over songs your father loved, without me knowing their significant.

I‚Äôm sorry I called you the missing price to my puzzle.

I‚Äôm sorry that I dedicated Songbird by Fleetwood Mac to you and you got emotional because your father loved that song but also would play it for you when you were a kid. I‚Äôm sorry you never shared this with me, but I‚Äôm sorry I reminded you of your father. 

I‚Äôm sorry I was the man you said your deceased father would have adored. 

Im sorry for getting pet insurance for your dog, for ensuring she was well-cared for with new food and vet visits. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the one time I forgot my wallet after a vet visit, prompting you to call me cheap‚ÄîI never intended to upset you. I‚Äôm sorry you were so angry after that. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the weekly  journeys I made by train and bus, traveling to be with you every Thursday through Sunday, sacrificing my time and comfort.

I‚Äôm sorry for never questioning the absence of photos from your ‚Äúgirls trips‚Äù and for being subjected to your anger each time I asked about friends whose names I never learned.

I‚Äôm sorry you chose baby names and pressured me into having sex with you in order to potentially get you pregnant, even though I wasn‚Äôt ready because it was still early on, and because we needed to figure a lot out still for me to be in a place where I felt we were both ready for that. Actually‚Ä¶ I did, several times. I even ensured I didn‚Äôt finish inside of you because my boundaries were routinely being crossed, and you continued.

I‚Äôm sorry for performing oral on you when you would demand and curse at me to do so explicitly. Do you  Remember when you bragged about demanding it later that one day before the Halloween party? I‚Äôm sorry you shared that with me. 

I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt  get you pregnant, even though you weren‚Äôt ready to be a mother. I‚Äôm sorry you still had to confront your reality and the truth of your reality before bringing a child into the world. 

I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt get you pregnant while there were disturbing things occurring behind my back during the entire duration of our relationship, and bringing a child into that situation would‚Äôve been disturbing. I‚Äôm sorry I felt that way. 

I‚Äôm sorry that when you would grab my hips and pull me in closer while I was finishing, even as I physically resisted, all while telling me to ‚Äúget you pregnant‚Äù and to ‚Äúfill you up.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sorry you had a manic look in your eyes when you would do that every time we had sex after the first month or dating and until the implosion‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sorry for feeling powerless in those moments, for not knowing how to assert myself by telling you what tou were doing frightened me.

I‚Äôm sorry for not giving in towards the end of us, to your physical force which you would use with me inn during  these moments.  I was scared of you , and for how deeply that crossed my boundaries.

I‚Äôm sorry that you didn‚Äôt get pregnant and therefore couldn‚Äôt get out of the things you were doing behind my back, or the life you were secretly leading, Heisenberg. 

I‚Äôm sorry you weren‚Äôt honest with me. I would‚Äôve rescued you from that life.

I‚Äôm sorry that I could have financially took care of you forever, and protected you forever as I promised I would‚Äôve. 

I‚Äôm sorry you picked lonely old men and their money, to fake attraction and relationships, even love with them. 

I‚Äôm sorry that the money you make doing this doesn‚Äôt change how alone and lonely you‚Äôve been and you‚Äôll always be? Who knows‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sorry that when you talked about and would plan our future, you beamed with a smile that could light up the world, dreaming of beating your sister to the altar or into motherhood. I‚Äôm sorry for how much of a savage your sister is. I‚Äôm sorry how horrible the relationship is and always will be between the two of you. 

I‚Äôm sorry for discussing marriage and homes in neighborhoods where you wanted to live, even though my job was an hour away. 

I‚Äôm sorry I put an offer on one of those eight million dollar homes two days before it all imploded.

I‚Äôm sorry I purchased one to the Tiffany engagement rings that you loved. Remember? During the second weekend we were together? we went to Tiffany‚Äôs, and I wrote down your favourite engagement rings. I always kept that piece of paper for a reason. 

I‚Äôm sorry I bought it and planned the proposal that never happened. 

I‚Äôm sorry for inquiring about your ‚Äúbusiness,‚Äù offering help with marketing, using my MBA and business acumen to support you, only to be met with evasion and silence. I‚Äôm sorry for questioning the lack of social media updates for two years for your ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry you were reluctant to speak of clients. Even when I just asked how work was going.

I‚Äôm sorry for being okay when you brushed me off after my aunt passed, for respecting your busy schedule over my grief. 

I‚Äôm sorry for always valuing your feelings, your emotions, even when they were wielded like weapons against me‚ÄîI‚Äôm not a fighter, except when it comes to defending my heart.

I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt have more time to manipulate, gaslight, and abuse me. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the way your life is built on lies and deceit, for cheating on someone who loved you more than you could comprehend, all while living a double life and lying to everyone in their life, all while being workings as an escort. 

I‚Äôm sorry you lied prior to us even meeting. 

I‚Äôm sorry you posed as someone you weren‚Äôt seeking a long term relationship on Hinge. 

I‚Äôm sorry you never were honest with me because I would‚Äôve asked you to quit, not have been made by your cheating, and we could‚Äôve moved on by having and fulfilling the dreams we constantly discussed, which you always initiated even. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you weren‚Äôt more creative with your front for a career and small business. 

I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt ask you more about the ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù you would constantly or randomly have and I would get upset despite never meeting them or knowing their names, or anything about them.

I‚Äôm sorry most of them likely wear elderly diapers, and have grey public hair. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you would get upset for me asking any further questions about your ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù after you brought the buddies (lol the word gets me still). 

I‚Äôm sorry that you would have likely have to change their diapers, and honestly, you should have just became a nurse instead.

I‚Äôm sorry for the marriages you destroyed and the children left without a father. Did that make you feel better for the tragic loss of your father? 

Im sorry that while on the phone, you threatened to jump off your balcony, and then left me on the other end, as you opened your balcony door, and I cried, begged, pleaded for you to be okay and not hurt herself for eight minutes that were the scariest eight fucking minutes of my life.

I‚Äôm sorry that when I threatened to call the police, you finally came back to the phone and pretended that you never threatened to jump off your balcony.

I‚Äôm sorry you accused me of wanting you to get better. I‚Äôm sorry you accused me of ‚Äúwanting you committed‚Äù, even though that wasn‚Äôt true and you never were committed, nor did anyone ever approach you about committing yourself. 

I‚Äôm sorry for you creating random fights between us, somehow making them my fault, and for me giving in and apologizing afterwards despite you conjuring these random fights to create space for a couple days between us so you could hang out with your buddies and get paid I suppose? I‚Äôm sorry for what they likely did to you.. I‚Äôm sorry there‚Äôs reviews online about your performance.

I‚Äôm sorry about one reviewer detailing how you were in bed with them three days after my birthday. 

I‚Äôm sorry that I would‚Äôve given you the financial freedom and wealth in addition to ensuring that you were the happiest woman to ever take a single breath on this earth. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you decided being an escort and being paid by lonely men was more important than what we had built and what you had told me you wanted for your life with me‚Ä¶ our life. 

I‚Äôm sorry that confronting you after being sent confirmation of who you really were randomly one morning.

I‚Äôm sorry that I always hoped, and fucking wished it was just a suspicion and I‚Äôm sorry for keeping it to myself without being resentful either. 

I‚Äôm sorry your sister had the same suspicions two years prior and you slapped her across the face for ‚Äúeven insinuating I would be a fucking hooker, a whore, or an escort‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm sorry that me knowing made you anxious because of your unwillingness to ever get help for your anxiety and paranoids.

I‚Äôm sorry your feared your sister‚Äôs judgment, even though your sister abuses her fianc√© daily and hasn‚Äôt even shown a person, or even her dog an ounce of kindness for even one second of her life. 

I‚Äôm sorry you put her potentially finding out even though she wouldn‚Äôt have, over the person who loved you more than any family, friend, ex boyfriend or girlfriend..: and buddy! Ever has or ever would have.

I‚Äôm sorry your sister will have to wait a little longer before she finds out the truth.

 I‚Äôm sorry for your loss false, horrific, disgusting, and appalling false accusations against me, which l led to me being arrested because I knew the truth.

I‚Äôm sorry you pretended to love me you went as far as to not only blanatntly lie  because as you would say, ‚Äúno one will ever believe a man could be abused by a woman. 

I‚Äôm sorry you use this twisted mentality twice against me just because you broke my heart and cheated on me for a year, all just to silence me not just from your abuse, but for your disaster of a sister not kicking you outbid her wedding party and disowning you for life.

I‚Äôm sorry she will regardless, because she‚Äôs an evil and jealous person.  

I‚Äôm sorry that I wrote these letters in my mind for each of the two 25 hour stints in jail, which caused me having uproot my life, forget what privacy is, ever think about romance and the learning the concept of trust is a waste of time and no one should or can be trusted again. 

I‚Äôm sorry you taught me that everyone‚Äôs actually evil.

I‚Äôm sorry I never crossed any boundaries with you of any kind, and I have all your texts that contradict your allegations. I‚Äôm sorry these texts also explicitly show that you were the blanat abuser in every manner‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry you won‚Äôt be coming up with these letters, or anything creative while you spend a large part of the rest of your life behind bars. I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre not creative, emotionally available, or charismatic enough for people to care about whatever you may have to say about a tik tok video you saw before you went to prison. 

I‚Äôm sorry you never became the influencer you thought you could be despite not having anything to say or interesting character traits that anyone would care about. I‚Äôm sorry you thought this was possible despite your regular eight likes on tik tok. 

I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt want to break bail again and spend the holidays and beyond, in a jail cell, while I‚Äôm still in a mental prison without physically being in a jail or prison cell.

I‚Äôm sorry you wore my clothes in a TikTok shortly after my first arrest and flaunted your life as if my world hadn‚Äôt shattered. Im sorry how un-credible of a witness you won‚Äôt ever get a chance to be‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry we didn‚Äôt meet years earlier, when we lived across the street, shopped at the same stores, banked at the same place, walked our dogs in the same neighborhood. I wish I could have steered you away from the path you chose, even though I didn‚Äôt know you then.

I would‚Äôve saved and protected you. I would‚Äôve never left‚Ä¶ ever.

I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt apologize when I confronted you upon finding out the day before I confronted you.

I‚Äôm sorry you sought out killing me and attempting to ruin my life as a better alternative.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù‚Ä¶ the words you believe every one, even people you‚Äôve never met and won‚Äôt ever meet owe you for reasons that you don‚Äôt even understand. 

You‚Äôre not the victim of any previous, current and future delusion. 

No one owes you as many sorry‚Äôs as you believe that all eight billion people on earth owe you.

You need to learn how to apologize to yourself first, for the people you‚Äôve literally killed and hurt, shattered, torn apart, cheated on, and discarded them like the gunk stuck to your shitty samba‚Äôs a 75 year old paraplegic likely got you after you gave them a happy ending. 

Apologize to your family for your lies of a decade or longer, apologize to your sister for assaulting her, to the mother you abandoned and blocked, all while leaving her with an apparent abuser (your words). 

You won‚Äôt. Or maybe‚Ä¶ fuck me‚Ä¶ fuck me for believing that you want to scream into the void because you‚Äôre fully aware of the damage you‚Äôve caused throughout your adult life to everyone you‚Äôve crossed paths with, and an amazing person is there. I saw her many times and I wanted to fucking hug you to through FaceTime the night before we last spoke because I saw a person who was destroyed, and desperately hurting because of the secret they harboured, and perhaps the dangerous, and evil people within their orbit who they wished died so you could live without fear any longer and be your true, loving, amazing, and strong individual that you truly fucking are.

Despite everything, you remain a beautiful person, inside and out. I see the good in you, the potential for happiness and health, if only you hadn‚Äôt destroyed what we had. Your father would want you to be okay.

I remember the night you asked me to promise to always protect you and never leave, and how I held you as tears streamed down my face.

In that embrace, I felt your anxiety, your fear, your loneliness, and I promised to always love you, more than all the galaxies out there, even those that haven‚Äôt been discovered yet. 

‚ÄúMore than the aliens?‚Äù you asked, our little joke. Yes, more than those aliens you adore. ‚ÄúI love you, and I‚Äôll love you forever. I‚Äôll never let you go.

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for still loving you and believing in you, and my fucking heart. 

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for the moment I finally get to tell you how much I love you again. 

I‚Äôm NOT and how I told you that I would always protect you, even after everything that you‚Äôve done. 

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for abandoning you like everyone else has throughout your life. 

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for saving you and showing you how beautiful life can be, or for teaching you that  every day doesn‚Äôt have to be dark like Alaska. 

You‚Äôre beyond worthy of your yellow brick road.    

&

I‚Äôm sure as fuck NOT sorry for believing in love. ",1,1734577622.0,UnsentLettersRaw,0,0.6,False

1hhjb4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/1hhjb4m/looking_for_spanish_speaking_youtube_channels/,Looking for spanish speaking Youtube channels,"I am trying to find youtube channels presented in Spanish.  Many recommendations I've seen are geared toward learning the language - which feels too fake for me.  I am only really interested in the channels I would actually watch if I lived in Central/South America.

I would love a Spanish speaking channel of a person traveling around Central and South America.

Some english speaking channels I like - 

Tom Scott, The Tim Traveller, Atomic Frontier, The Proper People, The Report of the Week, and Wendover Productions.

I also enjoy botany and coffee.  Im guessing there are at least a few channels in spanish of some people involved in coffee growing.

  
Thanks

1hhj9vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1hhj9vt/concerned_about_my_parents_lack_of_judgement/,Concerned about my parents lack of judgement while looking after our kids.,"My wife and I have two kids (2.5 yrs, 5 yrs) and my parents live fairly close by. My mom (let's call her Linda) is loving, caring, and wants to help out constantly. She wants to do her best and be a great resource. The constant help is rather annoying to my wife, but that's a separate issue. I've just grown up with her quirkiness and neediness, so I don't really think about it. I often just ignore her texts intentionally because they're long and sometimes senseless... but I digress...

The bigger issue is that my wife is highly concerned about our kids while in their care. My mom doesn't quite seem to have the judgement to recognize safe situations from unsafe. She also doesn't seem to recognize, apologize and correct herself when things happen. This has led to even lesser trust because it feels like she hides her errs in this way too.

My step-father is not really hands on, doesn't constantly pester to try and watch them. We don't expect him to care for our kids with the level of care that we want, because he has never really expressed that he is that capable, nor that he cares to be. He's kind and lovely with them, just not someone we see looking after them in the right way.

Admittedly, I've been the person in the middle trying to convince my wife that my mom is safer than I think my wife believes my mom is. I've also been on the other side telling my mom that she needs to stop making mistakes and overlooking things.

Here are some examples:

- while at their house, my mother was baking. She pulled a hot pan out from the oven and put it down on the coffee table within reach of my kids. She said 'maybe let's just be careful of the hot pan' (she said this almost hesitantly). Then she walked away. I said 'not a chance' and moved the tray to a spot out of reach.
- she left the door to the oven open when it was 400 degrees and my toddler was running around. When my wife told her it wasn't safe, she closed it halfway and thought that was fine.
- my wife saw my mom give my 2.5 yr old a sharp pair of scissors and then let her run away with them.
- my mom has shared that she knows how to put the car seats in and knows how to secure the children, but she hasnt done it properly multiple times before. She continues to ask for another car seat in her car to drive both kids around.
- while at their house, my 2.5 year old was pushing on their small tv. (40"" maybe). My stepfather was two feet away, watching her do it. The tv was wobbling, because of course its not secured to the wall, and my wife happened to look over from the kitchen and had to run in to stop it.. All the while, my step-father was watching her push the tv over and over and did nothing.
- when my 5 year old was a baby, my mom was bouncing him on her knee. He clearly didn't like it and was crying. My mom was laughing and continued to bounce him over and over. My step-sister had to say 'Linda, that's baby for ""I don't like that""' before she stopped.
- we went out and let her babysit last week (which my wife reluctantly/nervously agreed to). She forgot her phone, so I got my second phone for work and let her use that for emergency purposes. The battery was around 30% when we left. We also showed her how to work and unlock the TV so she could use it while we were gone. ...well, turns out she forgot how to unlock the TV and so she went on the phone and scrolled the internet or did whatever. At around 4% battery, she decided to call my step-father. The phone died during their conversation. She let us know that she knew the phone was going to die, and had looked for a charger but couldn't find one  She didn't know where the charging cable was and so she just left it dead. With the phone dead, we would have no way to get ahold of her, she would have no ability to call us in an issue, and she would have no ability to call 911 (other than with our alarm system, which I don't think she would know how to do). When my wife brought this up to her, she said ""if there was an emergency, I'd just scoop them up and take them outside"" (keeping in mind that it was -15 outside and 11pm). She showed no insight that having a dead phone was a problem or why it would be a concern.

Making things a bit worse, my wife has seen horrible things happen to kids through her work as an children's emergency room RN. I haven't seen bad stuff happens. I know that it does... it just doesn't feel like it happens often.  I get this sense that my wife is far more concerned than she needs to be about safety because of this, but I can't deny that that list of issues is a problem.

We're meeting with my mom and step-father on Friday because I blurted out to my mom that I couldn't keep defending her anymore and that we continue to have issues with her childcare and that we need to talk about what's going wrong and address these issues. Along side that, my wife wants to stop allowing them to watch them without us present.

So... Am I just naive and these are huge concerns that I shouldn't be taking lightly? AITA for not being 100% on my wife's side and sharing her level of concern? Any advice for having this conversation?",2,1734577453.0,Parenting,17,0.75,False

Thanks for clicking in. I'm Matt, 30, from Idaho. Dating around my parts feels clumsy, and often times feels like the kind of person I'm looking for isn't in this area, so I thought I'd give online a bit of a try.

[This is me!](https://imgur.com/a/Hwo0of1)

A bit about me!

* I just turned 30 a little bit ago. It was a terrifying experience at first, but I pretty quickly got over it lol. It overall encouraged me to target the areas in my life that I'm unhappy with to work towards making change there!
* Physically, I'm blonde haired, green/blue eyes, 5'10 or 5'11"", depending on the doctor (Still chronically short for Tinder), overall a pretty thin individual. I'd like to get back into working out, as I used to do calisthenics as a way to get into shape and be more active. I do wear glasses, which isn't portrayed in my pictures, however I'm happy to send you one with me wearing them!
* I currently work a WFH job as an analyst for some pretty large companies across the country, however I'm trying to change into tech/cybersecurity. It's a bit of a process, but I've been able to make some solid connections to progress in this!
* I'm likely trying to move to the east coast at some point, so potentially something to keep in mind! Likely, South Carolina.
* I'm Christian, however the kicker here is that I typically hold more liberal views. This is one of the biggest challenges to dating in my area, as it's heavily conservative.
* At this point in my life, I don't think I want children.
* I used to stream, and ran a pretty successful little stream for the amount of time I put into it! I'm still active in those communities.
* I'm more of an introvert, and I consider myself pretty low maintenance. I do enjoy nights in, however going out is lovely as well. Nature walks, coffee shops (Oooh, original), all of that are great! Bar scenes are less my type. Board games, playing piano (I really need to get back into this, or start another instrument), or a few select games on the computer are my interests. I typically find myself on Twitch lately.
* I attend counseling every two weeks to keep my mental health in balance, and help create better relationships.
* I tend to find my love languages somewhere between spending quality time, and physical touch, so this is a *less than ideal* way to meet someone, but you never know who you'll meet!

What I'm looking for!

* Naturally, I'd like to be physically attracted to someone (And I hope you would be too!).
* Someone who is taking care of themselves, physically, mentally, emotionally, etc. Maturity in all of this is lovely.
* Kindness. Please. Let's be kind humans together.
* I'm so attracted to intelligence, to the point where I've been bored lately without people to have deep conversations with. The last relationship I had taught me how much I actually value these.
* I'd ideally like someone younger than me, probably between 25-28, but I'm open!
* The closer someone is, the better ultimately, but again- You never know who you'll meet.
* I want to be friends with someone first, which feels an almost ironic statement for this, but sincerely building a relationship off a friendship has been the best experiences for me. I'd like to get to know you, hang out, no pressure, and if we don't vibe, that's fine! I'm still happy to make a friend.

Thank you for reading all of this. I look forward to hearing from you!",1,1734576676.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Hair thick with dreams wet with grease,

Do the dance of impertinent waiting,

Lint is inevitable, wrinkles inevitable,

Laundry day uninvited, life is uninvited.

Douse yourself in rags and drape yourself in merlot.

Don your finest cashmere.

Ice winds chill bones and rattles cages,

Breaks boughs, and battles stages-

Brisk and gray, trapped in a snow globe,

Teetering on the edge- soon a phantasm, phantom-

a passed phase, gravity a phage-

Defenses down and drawbridges broken-

Porous textures, peeled paint, age-warped windows,

Growing closer, obligations drawing nearer,

No words or eyes that betray your face,

There just for a moment, and that's all it takes.

Back to the other life, the one that lies in the waiting-

Outside, the air is crisp- the weather is changing.



\-



Take a trip down memory's rotted avenue,

Gentrified with catch-phrases and reinforced structures,

Things you ought to think plastered and painted,

Over things that you'd rather forget-

1hhiz8p,https://i.redd.it/msq1wqgkyp7e1.jpeg,review #11: Ron Zacapa 23,"before the review, i want to disclose that i am fully aware of why ron zacapa 23 is controversial, and i agree it is for good reason. i stumbled upon it by chance at a local shop going out of business. it was the best they had and i was able to buy it at a decent price. that being said, on with the review:


~


rum: Ron Zacapa 23

base: cane honey

producer: Industrias Licoreras de Guatemala

distillation: column still

abv: 40% (80 proof)

aging: blend of 6-23 year old rums, mostly younger with a small portion of the latter.

dosage: ~20 g/L

~

nose: oak, ripe bananas, honey, caramel, cherries, figs, candied almonds

palate: oak, honey, caramel, medium roast coffee, black cherries, dates, flamb√© bananas, sticky rice, tingly spice with a touch of citrus

finish: short but pleasant; honey, apple, orange peel

thoughts: this was honestly quite better than i expected. thankfully, it does not taste corporate, or not exactly. the 20 g/L dosage is not very noticeable to me. zacapa 23 is certainly ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù, but not in a way that would indicate added sugar if tasted blind. what really seems to shine in this rum is the barrel influence, which provides a warm and familiarly sweet profile, but not in a sugary way, rather a fruity and somewhat spicy way. that banana note (not the funky kind) has quite a longevity to it. zacapa 23 is a tad better than your standard ‚Äúrum for bourbon drinkers‚Äù, but at the same time could be enjoyed by someone in that vein. my biggest complaint is of course going to be the finish, which completely washes away in a matter of seconds. this is of course likely to be a result of the low proof, despite the rum‚Äôs decent mouthfeel before subsiding.

I was put on a cocktail of different antibiotics, and still till this day suffer with what seems like nerve damage and incontinence. I started to gradually have stomach issues ‚Äî specifically with alcohol. Whenever I would drink, I would get stomach/acid pain. Sometimes the pain would be so sharp I couldn't move. I would eat bananas and sweet potatoes to try and alleviate the pain and acid in my stomach. 

As time went on, I tried to test more with alcohol as I was still young, in my early 20s and very much in denial with my reality at the time. I would notice days after drinking alcohol I would have bloating, lots of gas, sometimes constipation, etc. It was bad, however, not bad enough to where I would give up alcohol. Fast forward to present day, I can no longer drink coffee without feeling like there is a ball in my throat and profusely burping. Additionally, now when I drink alcohol I have strange neck sensations. My throat will feel sore, and my neck will start to feel itchy, however, there are no hives or visible markings on my neck. I went to the doctor's a few months back for my alcohol issue, and they basically just told me to avoid my triggers and take antacids. I was also prescribed famotidine for two months earlier this year, taking it before breakfast, lunch and dinner. It helped for a bit, but during this time I was drinking alcohol therefore the acid reflux naturally came back. After being scarred from taking so many antibiotics, I actively try to avoid taking any meds unless I am in excruciating pain. I have not stopped drinking and my acid reflux is getting worse so now I am back on Omeprazole, and I am on my seventh day of the 14 day course. The neck pain freaks me out the most, I haven't drank any alcohol or coffee for seven days now but I still sometimes feel the itchy feeling in my neck. Additionally, I have never had issues with matcha but more recently when I drink matcha my neck has also been feeling itchy. Does anyone else have any similar experiences? No one in my family has any stomach issues nearly as bad as I do, however, my uncle on my maternal size had stomach cancer. All of this is so new and very SCARY to me and I feel like an alien as I am in my mid 20s and want to go out and be social, but fear the repercussions to come after a night out. I have no one in my life who can relate to me, but I am day by day trying to reframe my thinking and be positive. I am trying to enter 2025 on a good note, and be more optimistic!

1hhit5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/larrystylinson/comments/1hhit5c/my_two_cents_on_larry_as_someone_who_had_a/,My Two Cents on Larry As Someone Who Had a Similar Relationship,"**TL;DR:** Back in high school, I had a secret, whirlwind romance with someone who initially identified as straight. We navigated subtle, flirty moments, the challenges of being closeted, and the fallout of coming out publicly, all while I wrestled with my Christian upbringing. Looking back, the little moments of connection‚Äîthe glances, touches, and shared jokes‚Äîare why I believe in Larry Stylinson. Love isn‚Äôt always loud; sometimes it‚Äôs found in the quietest, most personal gestures.

I'd like to share my story. My ex very well may be in this group as they were a big fan of 1D when we were together in 2014, so I won't be sharing genders or super specific situations as to protect my identity. I wasn't a fan at the time (just recently became a fan and devout Larry following Liam's death - may he rest in peace) but they were and I wouldn't be surprised if they're in here. That being said, I'll start from the beginning. I've never publicly spoken about this as now I'm almost 30 and have a spouse and a kid. 

Sometime in late Junior year of high school in 2013, I developed a crush on this person. They were ""not gay"", and had been sexually active with folks of the opposite sex. I was in multiple relationships with members of the opposite sex throughout Junior and Senior year, and was devoutly christian (as you may know, some christians do not approve). Our friendship started out as harmless, we were in a study group together with a couple of other kids that met outside of school at a bookstore closeby. We had late night study sessions with coffee and exchanged numbers during one session. We also sat together in another class. The butterflies I felt being around this person were unmatched.

We really enjoyed being around each other, even just platonically. We laughed and joked, complimented each other's appearance, talked about each other to our friends, and made jokes about being ""together"". We texted back and forth all the time, made excuses to spend extra time together outside of class, and even exchanged valentines one year. Things were very flirty. 

One day in senior year, this person and I were texting back and forth around Christmas. I decided that I was going to tell them how I felt about them. I told them I needed to talk to them (over text) and they didn't understand what I was wrestling with (being gay and christian). I finally blurted out that I had a huge crush on them. They were confused at first and didn't know how to feel. We went around just knowing I had feelings for them and they were kind to me but distanced themselves a bit - but not too much. 

Fast forward a bit, and they came to me during school. They started flirting with me in a way that I had not seen them do. Lightly touching my hand during class ""on accident"", brushing my hair behind my ear, staring at me during class, showing up to my sports practices after school, giving me tons of compliments in front of other people. It progressed to us texting more, finding any school event excuse to see each other without us getting caught. Finally, we told our closest friends. I'm not proud of it, but this was all happening while I was in another relationship. That's where things got rough. 

The more serious we got, the more the person became jealous of my relationship I was in. They started to make fun of the person I was in a relationship with, and talked about how they were inadequate for me and that they didn't know how to treat me right. Finally, the other person and I couldn't take it anymore and we kissed at a school function in the dark where a few people saw us. A few days later, I cheated/we had sex (no I'm not proud of it). From there, everything spiraled. I broke up with the person I was with to be with them, we came out to the entire school, I got kicked out of my christian club I was in, and lost a ton of friends. Long story short, we had a beautiful relationship, and were very happy for a while until something else happened in college and we broke up. 

In many ways, my experience mirrors what I believe Harry and Louis went through‚Äînavigating subtle, unspoken moments of connection that can‚Äôt always be explained to the outside world. The little things‚Äîthe accidental touches, the stolen glances, the jokes that weren‚Äôt really jokes‚Äîare what made my experience so real, even when others didn‚Äôt understand it. Seeing the way Harry and Louis interacted, especially in those early years, feels so familiar because I‚Äôve lived those same moments. Love and connection aren‚Äôt always loud declarations; sometimes, they‚Äôre found in the quiet, private spaces between two people. That‚Äôs why I believe in Larry‚Äîbecause, like my story, it‚Äôs not about proving anything to anyone. It‚Äôs about what‚Äôs real to the people involved, and sometimes, the smallest gestures speak the loudest truths.

I have used it every day for a couple years now. It was a refurb when I got it and dripped right away which is apparently really common. The puddle of water and having to always keep a cup in place to catch the drip was my only frustration with the machine. This is only day one but I all always really happy. The pressure is still great and was not bad before the swap. I got the kit to replace the valve on the unit if I ever need it.

This is a time of year many are in the kitchen preparing for the holidays. It makes me remember my own grandmother and her recipes, her tips and tricks to cooking. I can‚Äôt help but wonder what kind of knowledge used to be passed down from the older generations in the kitchen. Tips that made recipes great. 

Please take a moment to remember who first inspired you to love cooking or who had an older loved one let them into the kitchen during this time of year to watch them bake. What did you learn from them that we can all benefit from because not everyone here had that in their lives. Some of us started with the internet and not grandmothers. 

I‚Äôll go first. Here is a recipe for frosting I picked up as a kid hanging out with an older lady that owned and operated a small restaurant in the town I grew up in. Here is her ‚Äòsecret‚Äô cinnamon roll frosting. 

1 tsp vanilla,
1 tsp melted butter,
A few drops almond extract,
1 tsp coffee from yesterday,
Mix in enough powdered sugar to make a frosting. Start with 1/2 cup but continue to add until you get the desired consistency. This amount varies with differences in wet ingredients and has to be done by feel or mood. 

I remember this frosting being made when I was barely tall enough to see over the counter and she would add the coffee directly from the mug she was drinking from. Not something you can get away with nowadays. She told me the best was to use coffee from yesterday. What other tips or tricks might be lost to the sands of time?",1,1734575403.0,Baking,1,1.0,False

I work in a skyscraper and have my own office. Literally a dream job - I‚Äôm so excited and do not want to mess anything up. For context: my company owns three floors in the building, my office is on the uppermost floor. The office has a policy that most employees only need to be in the office 2 days per week, so most days the office is pretty empty - especially my floor. 

Today (my third day at the job) I accidentally woke up a bit late and hastily grabbed a pair of pants draped over my dresser and threw them on while getting dressed (this is important for later). I park in a ramp about a 15 min walk from my building (parking nearby is crazy expensive). I made it the entire walk and into my office not noticing anything amiss. About 30 minutes into my day, I get up to use the bathroom (coffee am i right?). Again, I notice nothing amiss. One hour later I get up again. I am gone for maybe 5-7 minutes. However, this time when I walk back to my office, a black pair of panties is laying outside my office door. I immediately know they are mine and literally move at the speed of light to grab them and run into my office and shut the door. I think the last time I wore my pants (they were jeans - I wash every 2-3 wears ok?) was out for drinks with my friends, and I had taken them off with my underwear at the same time. Normally, I would remove my underwear and throw them in the laundry right away (I promise I am a hygienic person), but I assume in my drunken state I must have just dropped my pants and gone to bed, forgetting my underwear was still in there when folding them on my dresser the next day. Anyway, somehow in my rush this morning, I must have pulled the pants on with the loose underwear still in there and it must have been slowly falling down the pants leg until it fell out the second time I got up.  

I‚Äôm almost positive no one saw my thong on the floor - as I was only gone for a few minutes and I‚Äôm pretty sure there was only one other person working in-office on my floor at that point. But I am so terrified that someone did see them or that somehow they had been there for longer and I missed them. Anyways, I feel so embarrassed by the whole thing and feel too humiliated to talk to my friends family or boyfriend about it. How did I make it through a trek across the city and one full trip to the bathroom without realizing a pair of panties was loose in my pants???? I‚Äôm an idiot.

1hhihl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/JCBWritingCorner/comments/1hhihl4/pretending_to_be_a_space_marine_at_a_magic_school/,Pretending to be a Space Marine at a Magic School,"Hey everyone! Here is something that is very much about the nature of man. More specifically, about the Imperium of Man from Warhammer 40,000. It was a fun concept to have the xenocide lovers go straight to a realm of ~~heresy~~ magic and figure stuff out. How would it go?

Just a little disclaimer here. I really wanted to write ‚ÄòImperium of Man Visits Nexus‚Äô or ‚ÄòGUN made Emma Astartes‚Äô, but there is an inherent problem with both of them. In the first, the Imperium will no doubt go in, see that there is magic, remember that magic is heresy and then launch a full-on purging campaign against the Nexus. Not how school works. As for the second one, remember that Astartes as all boys gang. So I made a compromise. In this little story, Emma received enhanced genetic augmentations like Spartans from Halo. This was to make a few things more manageable, and still let more-or-less a normal human rock the Astartes Power Armor.

But G.U.N. is not the Imperium. So I improvised! Basically there was a post on r/humansarespaceorcs a few months back, titled something like ‚ÄòAliens think Warhammer 40K is real‚Äô. Well guess what, we can fool the magic medieval into thinking that, they literally don‚Äôt even know tech or grimdark.

So here is what I‚Äôve randomly written, about G.U.N. pretending to be the Imperium and BSing their way in as they right fully should.

***Note-*** *This is in no way meant to desecrate the original work, or the Warhammer lore. It‚Äôs just an idea I got and went ahead for the laughs. I assure you that while some things might be accurate, others would be outright random. Because we have this, uh, thing here.*

Also, special thanks to u/Alternative_Tart3560 for giving me the original 'Imperium visits Nexus' idea!

^(Thank you for attending my Ted Talk.)

\----------

When we asked the Nexus to call us ‚ÄòG.U.N.‚Äô or simply ‚ÄòHumanity‚Äô, they ignored it and just called us ‚ÄòEarthrealmers‚Äô.

So we were all naturally very, veeerry much weirded out when they addressed us as ‚ÄòThe Imperium of Man‚Äô.

At first it was dismissed as language trouble- we‚Äôd been having trouble translating their ‚ÄòHigh Nexian‚Äô and they were very much having trouble with English, and that too just for sending us written messages that we could actually read.

*But said designations continued, and so did a few other things which sounded like a mash up of Latin stuff.*

First there were words like ‚ÄòAdeptus Administratum‚Äô, and a bunch of others just prefixed with ‚ÄòAdeptus‚Äô on them. The linguists were internally freaking out, and Command thought that they were fools of the first order.

I mean seriously, what is a Mechaico-, no, mechanico, no no no‚Ä¶ Mechanicus! Yes, that‚Äôs the one. What in the name of hell was that? And what‚Äôs up with letters addressed to some Emperor? Sure, the spooks down in R&D knew that this ‚ÄòNexus‚Äô was backwards and had a king, but I guess it could only be logical that they referred to our brass as ‚ÄòEmperor‚Äô- they think we‚Äôve got kings‚Ä¶ not that they know any better.

*But interpreting any of this is leagues above my paygrade, so off I went to training without a second thought.*

Little did I know that this whole operation just got practically handed to the spooks because of one single lab tech‚Äôs fault.

When I say that tab techs are the most deranged humans in existence, *I am not joking.*

*They are* ***freaks****.*

Because the fools sent in a fictional book to the Nexus. They asked us for a few literary works and other things like dictionaries to communicate better, and being 5 months away from arrival, we sent them what they asked for through the portals they opened for fleeting seconds. Of course, to prevent a‚Ä¶ disintegrated fate like Pilot-1, this was done remotely via robotic arms that just chucked stuff into the portal.

*Well, guess what?* One of the techs was reading something called ‚ÄòCodex: Space Marines‚Äô and accidently left that book in the pile of books meant to be thrown straight into another plane of existence. And off it went. Even since that, we‚Äôve been addressed as the ‚ÄòImperium of Man‚Äô, and majority of mission parameter control went straight to the spooks who were ready to capitalize on it.

*The strategy was simple*. If they think we‚Äôre some over-the-top super powerful empire with immense power, we give them that. And while the G.U.N. glitter was really good, we just found that if we pretended hard enough, we could pull it off. I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre actually pretending to be this faction that the Nexus believes us to be, just to outright lie about our capabilities and stuff, which was further highlighted by the fact that the medieval folk out there thought that *we‚Äôd just sent them our entire military doctrine.*

*And so command had turned to a few people that they considered ‚Äònot completely insane‚Äô and asked what was necessary to pull such a stunt off. Of course they weren‚Äôt given details, we just extracted info from them.*

And the second they got the go-ahead from Command? *The lab freaks went bonkers.*

*Not because of them being so orky with their methods- that‚Äôs acceptable- but because of their whole ‚Äòwhy not?‚Äô attitude. And maybe the fact that one of them happens to be a Warhammer fanatic. No, I did not say fan- when I said fanatic, I meant it.*

Because the fools made the E-ARRS look like an A-start-ees. Whatever that is.

On first look it was‚Ä¶ powerful. It looked powerful, at least. And the 8 foot tall hulking behemoth that overshadowed the actual standard G.U.N. power armor was also ‚Äòenchanted‚Äô- meant to specifically resist this ‚Äòmana‚Äô radiation.

*But of course the eggheads needed it ‚Äòlore accurate‚Äô, whatever even classifies as that, because just the other day I heard someone in that lab say ‚Äòeverything‚Äôs canon‚Äô.*

I am concerned about this.

I mean the **mission**. I‚Äôm concerned about the *mission*. These people are too far gone to be concerned about.

So one might be wondering why I‚Äôm sitting in front of a lab tech from the same race of freaks, and listening to his rambling since an hour. Oh yeah, because it was ‚Äòvital‚Äô to the mission. Sure, listening to tech-edgelords is important to the mission.

I could be training with the Diplomatic Corps right now, but noo I must stay here.

*At least he‚Äôs reaching the exciting parts, he‚Äôs been reading safety manuals since the last hour or so.*

‚ÄúSo you see, Cadet Booker, that we have successfully increased the size of the armor. With increase in size comes more additions in terms of tech, and with tech comes more power. The ‚Äòbackpack‚Äô is similar to standard power armor, and the software is the same. You shouldn‚Äôt even feel a difference, but the thing is that this specific thing requires a few more genetic mods and better stims. Normally we‚Äôd been thinking of implanting an extra lung and heart,‚Äù My actual heart stopped at that, ‚Äú-but HIGHCOM doesn‚Äôt want the risks of ‚Äòcool‚Äô over utility. So the titanium implants along bones are also off the chart.‚Äù Oh thank whichever star was responsible for not letting these eggheads make a garbled mess of me.

*He goes over a few more details, and I try my best to remember his name without letting it show that I had in fact, forgotten it for the umpteenth time. I thought so hard that it honestly must have drained a sizeable portion of my lifeforce away, but at long last I remembered that he was called John.*

‚ÄúSo finally just one more genetic implant and-‚Äú

‚ÄúJohn, sir, I‚Äôm sorry but this kind of detail is beyond my scope.‚Äù

‚ÄúJohn? He‚Äôs on sick leave, I‚Äôm Dan.‚Äù

I was dumbfounded for a moment as I thought my memory failed me, but he continued to explain that they were twins. And now I have to worry about them using telekinesis too, because they are twins. Great.

After another awkward conversation I walked out of the small room straight into another room, and was instantly hit with the pungent odour of all sorts of chemicals. One final augmentation, and it‚Äôll be over. It‚Äôs not much, they said- just a bit of a dose of ‚Äòeternal coffee‚Äô as they call it.

I was strapped down to a tilted table, and for the first time since the augmentations it hit me a bit hard- the difference. I used to be about 5‚Äô10 earlier, and out of the candidates was on the ‚Äòshorter‚Äô side. But after the augmentations, our height and strengths were greatly enhanced- which meant that my 6‚Äô8 was still ‚Äòshort‚Äô, but my unholy luck ensured that I was thankfully one of the ones who didn‚Äôt get crippled for life during the procedures. And thanks to my relations to Auntie Ran, I‚Äôm here now.

The needle came down at me- attached to a servo arm. The crystal blue liquid disappeared as my vision faded to black.

*One last step.*

***One final resolution.***

\---

After a thousand years of pain I finally awoke, only to realize that I‚Äôd been out for two hours. Such was the relativity of time. This was the final augmentation, and now I‚Äôd finally get to wear the ‚Äòenchanted‚Äô power armor.

The restraints from my arms and legs were removed and I was led to a sideroom where the techsuit was put on. It hung loose, and then gradually tightened around me slowly. It was gray and had several bracings and straps which would latch onto the insides of the armor.

Once the techsuit was on I was led to another room by Dan and a few other techs, this time in full hazmats. I was led onto a slightly raised cylindrical surface, and told to spread out my arms to grab the handles of what was a thin ring vertically mounted to the overhead assembly machine. The second I grabbed the handles, my hands were kept in place by braces and my feet too were strapped to the ground. Then the floor itself opened, several servo arms and assembly machines began building the suit around me. The huge composite alloy parts wrapped around me perfectly, and in seconds the first layer was done- I looked around and could see the servos and mechanisms- somewhat ugly yet beautiful in their own right- and then my back stiffened as the chestplates‚Äô base pieces locked into place.

Then the external layers began to form up around me- the gunmetal blue fit perfectly in place and covered up the delicate interior. It took a good five minutes, but the armor was now on me, and suddenly the power flicked on and I could finally move around. The shoulder pauldrons and other oversuit pieces were quick to be attached, and it left an imposing helmetless figure in the room that bore the colors and flag of the Greater United Nations of Earth, and a weird inverted Ohm symbol on a shoulder.

*It felt so, so fluid. I could barely feel any weight- even without the calibrations- such was the extent of augmentation. It was amazing, and I felt even better as the haptic response systems kicked in and I could essentially ‚Äòfeel‚Äô everything around me. There was a whirring sound and as I looked up, the final piece descended.*

The helmet came down slowly and I looked forward to it- literally. The intricate helmet latched onto the suit, the mag-locks clicking in place. The visor wasn‚Äôt there- I could see just fine with my eyes, and knew that the visor would only lower and fill my vision when I wanted it to.

The helmet compacted, and its various external layers clicked and contracted a little till they felt comfortable, and the restrains were then lifted away. I walked forward, almost wincing at how loud a single boot of composite metal felt on solid metal grating. I came to the calibration station, and then the lights went off. A single strobing red light could be seen in the distance, and suddenly the red-tinted opaque lens came into my view, lowering from the inside of the helmet itself.

*My eyes could no longer be seen from the outside- all that could be seen were two slightly angry opaque eyes that seemed to almost glow red in the dark.*

The calibrations further removed weight from me, and the 8 foot tall suit I now inhabited seemed almost natural. Almost‚Ä¶ perfect.

Thereon the interface booted up, and the EVI greeted me with a curt ‚ÄòWelcome‚Äô, before relegating itself to the background to face more important tasks than making itself known to the user. My requested presets were already here, and the comm notification told me to move to the IAS Portal room immediately.

I was given an adequately sized firearm to use with this hunk of blue, and I gladly accepted what was essentially an overgrown pistol. But it had the firepower so I didn‚Äôt feel the need to question anyone about it.

¬†

*So yes, I am about to go into a parallel dimension of magic and pretend to be this‚Ä¶ thing here. I‚Äôve even been given the rank of ‚ÄòChapter Master‚Äô. While the techs said that this is in no way the correct verbiage, Command thought that giving me a rank that was technically high could be helpful in a Nexus where most students were nobles and such.*

*And boy, oh boy have I been given the strangest of knowledge about what I am to say there. Apparently, I am Chapter Master Emma Booker of some ‚ÄòUltramarines‚Äô Chapter as per Command (and because of which I had to hear ear-shattering amounts of ‚Äòlore‚Äô from various edgelords), and I belong to the Imperium of Man and was going to the Nexus to represent humanity. Poetic, to be honest. Greet xenos with someone known for xenocide. No, not genocide- that would imply that they aren‚Äôt xenos. Don‚Äôt give me that look, Dan said that too.*

*And this armor was supposedly made by some cultist tech support people called the Mechanicus, who worship decaying product manuals and pray to make-believe stuff to make tech they don‚Äôt understand work. Humans are invited to a magic realm. Humans start a conversation with a lie. Excellent. When I pointed that out, all I received was ‚ÄòYou are Alpharius‚Äô.*

¬†

As I walked out, I saw a reflection in a mirror. The armor was imposing sure, but it made the standard armor look smaller in comparison. I wouldn‚Äôt doubt it if the ‚Äòsmaller‚Äô armor could beat this hulk, but the intimidation factor was strictly for this Astartes, as it is called, which Dan told me over the comms. He actually transferred the original design for this armor to me, and I couldn‚Äôt decide whether to be amazed or horrified by it. The original design was of an ‚ÄòUltramarine‚Äô, as it was called, and had golden wings with a skull in the smack center of the chestplate.

Even the backpack had a skull with an inverted ohm logo, and the shoulder pauldrons had what looked like a ceramite skull with actual gold text below. Another skull was strapped to the top part of the helmet and a kneecap of the armor, and the pistol I received, even it can be called that, was supposed to have a skull on each side. Thank whatever high command brass decided to not go with this insanity- if we wanted to kill off the Nexus, a nuke would do, but this‚Ä¶ this thing would give them nightmares. Especially because one of the variants of the original design had a skull as the frontpiece of the helmet. I did look classy though‚Ä¶

I recited the U.N. code of conduct mentally as I strode down the long hallway that led straight to the portal. I had given up everything to be here- friends, family, hell. I‚Äôd given up a real college and straight up was giving up any contact with my civilization for at least an year- but I wouldn‚Äôt give up my loyalties.

I could hear the Director make a speech via the comms- everybody listened in and I grew a bit nervous. Thankfully the layers upon layers of metal did an impeccable job at hiding that.

The second I entered the room, it was sealed off and I could see the telltale signs of the portal powering up- the sparks from the power coils cast a brilliant white now and then, and the Director and I shared a few words before I stepped away from this world of technology.

1hhigao,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hhigao/beginners_story_is_espresso_mostly_just_a_hobby/,Beginner's Story: Is Espresso Mostly Just a Hobby?,"For the past month or so, I've been on a quest / rabbit hole in figuring out which espresso machine to buy, coming in as a rookie to this new field for me. After maybe \~50 hours of youtubing and combing through reddit, I've somehow convinced myself that I should buy an ECM synch ii, along with a Niche Zero. Along with all the other accessories I'll need, I'm looking at around $5k. I've been contemplating whether this would be a rational purchase, and I can't quite figure out if it would.

Here's the paradox I'm seeing: it seems like you need to move up to a dual boiler if you're making milk-based espresso machines often. The ones that caught my eye are all $3k and up. But to me, the paradox is that if you're making milk-based drinks, why does it matter if the espresso is perfectly made - won't the taste get drowned out anyway? An analogy for liquor would be buying a $100 bottle of whiskey/brandy/whatever, and just making a sweet-n-sour drink with it. You could have just used a $15 bottle and had the same result. So then, wouldn't a high-end, ""prosumer"" espresso machine really only make sense if you're drinking espresso ""neat"" (or at most, a macchiato, maybe even cortado)? But once you move to cappuccinos and lattes, can you really tell the difference of an espresso brewed by a $3k machine vs. a Bambino or even cheaper? If there's relatively no difference in taste to the majority of people (maybe some people have a super refined palette, I don't know), then the only advantage you're getting from a much more expensive machine is saving a few seconds (dual boiler lets you steam simultaneously, better machines can steam quicker, etc.). But I imagine most of us are only making 1 or 2 drinks per day 360 days a year, and maybe 5 days we have some guests over, needing to make them back-to-back. On this point: worth the $2500 difference? Maybe, maybe not.

  
I can't imagine that many people with espresso setups in the thousands of dollars are mostly drinking neat espressos, or whatever you call them in the coffee world :). So then, does it just boil down to: espresso is a hobby / way of life? Because to me it doesn't make sense going through all the hoops of getting the perfect grinder, perfect espresso machine, dialing your pulls in, and so on, if you're just drinking milk-based espresso drinks anyway (or honestly probably even americanos).

Curious if anyone else has gone through this. Did you mostly go through with all this just for a new hobby (or just for the sake of getting new toys), or did it actually open new doors in terms of taste / quality of drinks?

1hhifoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hhifoh/my_partners_health_is_really_weighing_down_on_me/,My partner‚Äôs health is really weighing down on me.,"My partner and I have been together since March. He is the most wonderful, kindest, and most caring partner I have been with and my first healthy relationship with a person who I can actually see potentially being in my future.

My partner has faced a series of unfortunate events with his health since basically the start of the relationship. We have only had a solid 6-8 normal weeks together, and it is getting really hard having to see people do regular couple things and have normal relationships. Everything crumbled at the blink of an eye. 

The first thing that happened was my partner caught an illness due to contaminated water at the nursing home he works at. It was absolutely horrible, he was down for literally the entire summer. He lives alone, I am in his apartment the majority of the time, but I do have my own place to go back to. I was washing him, dressing and undressing him, cleaning and making sure he was well-fed. I missed out on properly celebrating my birthday plus an entire summer of activity, which is the only break period I have each year since I am a student. I did not see or do anything with anyone. Friends, family, anyone. I was locked in the house caring for him until the start of the next semester. But I did it because I care, of course. 

Immediately after recovering from his illness and at the beginning of my semester, he was injured at work and has been disabled ever since with no end in sight. He is unable to walk without assistance of a cane, or me. He is receiving workers comp and it is barely enough to even cover rent, let alone anything else. The fridge has been empty for months. He has lost dozens of pounds. I am breaking my paychecks to support him and I am really just upset that I am not having the experiences in a relationship that I want to have. We have only been on one date. We have been together for nearly a year and 90% of our relationship has been us locked in the house. I am always buying food for two, always buying groceries for two. I am running through money and effort that I need to be dedicating to succeeding in my studies. I am trying to not sound selfish, but I genuinely do not enjoy struggling with men. Every time I have stuck my neck out for men in the past and helped them at their lowest, they have showed me nothing but apathy when I reach my lowest. If I was not here, this man would literally have absolutely nothing to eat or drink. Not even a bottle of water. He‚Äôd literally starve. The electricity nearly got cut off last week. 

My partner is incredibly kind and selfless. He will refuse to take bites out of my food even though I can hear his stomach grumbling. If he has even $10, he will use it on me. He will wake me up if he knows I did not eat, he cannot sleep if he knows I ate nothing that day. Even disabled, he will stand and go cook something for me. Even if it‚Äôs as simple as a pot of white rice and absolutely nothing else. He is a kind man, he is a good man. He always encourages me to go home, saying he‚Äôll be fine. Dude, how can I go home when I know you‚Äôll be in this apartment, alone, with nothing to eat? You cannot even stand in the shower by yourself. 

Being a caretaker in any capacity is extremely hard on the mind and soul. I was a CNA for several years, and while I do feel compassion and love for my partner, it is insanely difficult to feel completely responsible for the welfare of another person. All the time. For this long. I get it, in sickness and in health. But as selfish as this sounds, I have pondered leaving him several times as I cannot continue missing out on my life to take care of another person who has been ill in some way for nearly a year and will continue to be ill for god knows how long. We have only been on one date and we have hardly any pictures together. We‚Äôve shared barely any nice, memorable experiences. Every day is the exact same. Get up, go on the couch, wonder where the next meal will come from, checking the bank account and seeing that you only have $0.43, repeat. Every. Single. Day. Wake up, go on the couch and watch mindless TV. Nothing else. He doesn‚Äôt even want to open up the blinds on the window. It literally just feels like we are two bums shacking up together but stay together in the name of love. I love my partner and he knows that. But god, it is frustrating sometimes. There is no toilet paper in the house. No hand soap, no money to do laundry. Same bed sheets for months. Wearing the same pair of underwear for multiple weeks because there‚Äôs no detergent. I am a full time student and a part time worker and dedicating this amount of effort into supporting a grown man is getting exhausting. I want to take a walk around the park with you. I want to hold hands in public, I want to go to the local caf√© and share a cup of coffee with you. I want to actually feel like I am in a RELATIONSHIP. I just want him to fucking get better already so I can actually feel like I am someone‚Äôs partner and not their caretaker. Our entire relationship has been like this. It‚Äôs really hard.",7,1734574799.0,offmychest,12,0.89,False

1hhifbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1hhifbz/completely_warped_priorities/,Completely warped priorities,"So, NDad and I have been LC for a while. We text on birthdays and holidays, maybe go for  coffee or lunch a couple times a year. It's the usual kind of backstory: He doesn't bother to be in my life or my kids' lives unless he wamts something, I rather prefer him not in my life now that I understand how emotionally (and, rarely, physically) abusive he was when I was growing up, etc.

About eight weeks ago, he texted‚ÄîTEXTED‚Äîmy brother and I to let us know our grandfather had passed away. Not only that he had passed away, but that he had passed away *the night before.* 

Today, he calls me during my workday. I didn't answer because, yeah, I'm at work, in a meeting with a VP, and busy. Ten minutes later, he calls again, then texts to say, ""hey, [my name], call me as soon as you have the chance."" Now I'm thinking, ""OMG, what happened that's this urgent??"" 

So as soon as I'm done my meeting, I do not pass Go, do not collect $200, I go straight to a private phone room and call him back, expecting something devastating has happened. 

You probably already know it was nothing of the sort. 

He so urgently called repeatedly and texted me, during my workday and his, to ask if he could come over on Sunday to say hello. 

What. The. Fuck. 

And now I'm pissed at myself for once again trusting enough to be sent for a ride on this rollercoaster. Because of course, this isn't the first time. 

He VERY URGENTLY needed my help with getting my mom's signature on a legal document that was not actually needed for a few more weeks, but couldn't be bothered to tell me he took his new partner‚Äîwho's about my age‚Äîoff on a trip to propose to her, until I saw her ring and asked directly. 

He can't remember my kids' birthdays, but he never failed to call me repeatedly asking for money a few years ago (that's what led to us being LC). 

He can't remember how many fucking grandkids he has to put them in his own father's obituary, but when he needs pictures for the slideshow for the memorial service next month it's daily email reminders. 

And speaking of, we wouldn't want to interrupt his holiday plans to have a timely funeral. Fuck it, that shit can wait. What's important is the price he paid for the non-refundable plane tickets. 

I am so sick of this shit. And I hate how I feel all this grief and anger and sadness and just EVERYTHING whenever stupid shit like this happens. It's far from the worst shit he's ever done, but it didn't happen in a vacuum, either. ",5,1734574767.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,0.86,False

1hhif6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/s/fMpDxtCkIg,My roommate is very... stupid [UPDATE],"Back by semi popular (not really i needed to vent again) demand, my roommate. 

Sigh, these past weeks have been‚Ä¶ I shouldn‚Äôt say torture but it was definitely trying.

Firstly, thanks for the heating pad advice, putting it in the freezer did wonders for it. Now for the rant block. I‚Äôd like to put time into context by labeling before thanksgiving break, what I assume was during the break, and after.

Before break:

I‚Äôve had to reset my boundaries with her again, and a piece of that was reiteration of pitching in with buying common use items (dish soap, paper towels, etc.).
Not even an hour later one of her friends sent me a few dollars for dish soap‚Ä¶ Now, dont get me wrong, it's okay to ask for help sometimes... but as I stood in front of the mirror that hangs on the back of my door, staring at myself and accepting that I exist beyond my own self; perceived when absent; I realized how embarrassing that was for a grown woman with a steady job, stable income, AND parents who give her money, to refuse to go halfsies on common use items used by us both and that her FRIEND sent me those few dollars.

I‚Äôve actually brought this up a lot, the whole going half on common items, and had I not had a small crisis in a mirror I wouldn‚Äôt have realized she genuinely is doing everything in her power to avoid paying halfsies.
She gets paid bimonthly, as we all do, and also makes more than me üò≠. I don‚Äôt think cheap could define her! What's worse than cheap!!?

Digressing, remember that guy from before? The one she‚Äôs extra cruel too? Ah, well, let‚Äôs just say she gets worse. Beginning week of November he had TWO separate relatives pass. He was close to them from what I could deduce when he came over. He told us, roommate and I, about the sudden passings of his relatives and began to cry as any sane person would. After? She was going on and on to me about how much of a ‚Äòpussy‚Äô he was because he was crying. Because his close relatives suddenly passed away. IN THE SAME WEEK‚Ä¶

During break:

Imagine, you‚Äôve just gone home for the week to your parents house, the relationship is a tense one in general, so you‚Äôre extra stressed.

You come back to the safety of your dorm, you‚Äôre tired, you just want dinner. You would‚Äôve stopped somewhere but as your mama always said, you got food at home.
So there I was, cheffing it up, I‚Äôm half dead but I‚Äôm still going making some simple SEASONED fried fish (not deep fried) and rice. My rice cooker was on, cooking my rice, I turn the ire on high, set the pan on and as I wait for it to heat up I step away for a moment to put a couple things into my room.

Fatal mistake. 

As I‚Äôm putting those things away the acrid, sulfuric smell of burnt ass coffee (read as: ‚Äò[burnt chicken nugget](https://youtu.be/fjn4H8Zy3pc)‚Äô) assaults my senses violently. Then I see the smoking.

I had to open all the windows to avoid setting the fire alarm off. Colder than Jack Frosts pinkie toe out, and now there‚Äôs caramelized coffee on the stove and every single time it‚Äôs turned on it begins smoking heavily. I'm assuming she spilled coffee and didn't clean it up and of course, i didn't realize. 
All i wanted was some fish and rice. 

I long for the days of my ignorance to the possibility someone like this truly exists.

After.

Id post the picture of the damage done to the ire but since I sent her the photo and a small text block about how unhygienic that is, and inconvenient that mess was, I don‚Äôt think I should post it. However. Let me tell you Reddit, you would‚Äôve been GOBSMACKED.

This is less of a rant piece more of an annoyance, but for the entirety of the week, finals week, she keeps bringing friends over so late, 10pm and beyond.
They‚Äôd stay in the living area, being loud. Playing music on a speaker, shrieking and laughing. Until deep into the night. i'm talking 1, 2 sometimes 3 am. 

The first night this happened, I told her to please keep it down as I had a lot to do tomorrow and needed to get sleep and I‚Äôll give it to her they did quiet down. The next day, I asked her that if she was going to bring a friend or two over late at night, just for this week, /Finals Week/, to please stay in her room with them.

Did that happen? No. Have all my patience been tested? Yes.

I‚Äôve talked to accommodations they are aiming to get me a single apartment for the coming semester. I can‚Äôt do anything right now but endure.( ;-;).
