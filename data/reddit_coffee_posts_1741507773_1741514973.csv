1j74j8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1j74j8x/a_happy_story_how_i_got_cured/,"A happy story, how I got cured","It all started after one weird meal in a foreign country. Acid reflux (which I’ve never had until then), gastric pains (had as a kid), burping non-stop, bloating. I ate relatively healthy before (no fast carbs or ultra-processed foods), hadn’t smoked or drank alcohol. After that meal, I couldn’t drink coffee, couldn’t eat almost anything, including greens that were the main part of my diet.
I went straight to a GP, was tested for pylori (negative), was prescribed Omeprazole, and told that I probably have a hernia. Further tests were unavailable at this early stage in the protocol. I managed to get referred to a gall bladder ultrasound, because I used to have sludge.
I refused to take Omeprasole without any conclusive diagnosis and decided to start with whatever other changes I could do.
I had had a chest infection with three courses of antibiotics some half a year before that, so I thought that my digestion was still out of balance due to that. Plus maybe some weird bacteria with that meal in a foreign country.
I used a wedge pillow for sleep.
Took gaviscon before sleep.
I did an elimination diet. Acid watchers diet didn’t work for me. For about a month I could tolerate only chard, chicken breast, and a millet or oat porridge. 
I also took supplements. I approached the reflux from several angles (anxiety-related, biome-related, immune-system related), so I took these things:
Probiotic (spore probiotics (don't remember the brand), Irwin Naturals cleanse with triphala).
Prebiotic (psyllium).
Aller-pure by Irwin Naturals for possible allergy reactions/immune system overreaction after the infection.
L-Theanine, Magnesium for anxiety.
Calcium 
Mastic gum
Oregano oil capsules (removed the bloating)
Zinc
Marshmallow, aloe, slippery elm complex
DGL
L-Glutamine (this helped me immediately with gastric pains).
Digestive enzymes with bromelain (New brand Super Enzymes).

Things that didn’t work:
I tried mixing baking soda with hot water and then adding cool water to it and drinking, but it was horror - I must have felt every of my sore spots in the digestive tract as it went down.
Vinegar.
Lemon.

Things were slowly improving and after four months of this regimen (with adding more foods to my diet), I can now eat everything I ate before the fateful meal. I can drink coffee, eat spicy, sour, everything. 
Hope this will help someone, who like me could have something not so serious. 
Btw I had my ultrasound three months after the referral and it went splendidly. I felt almost completely healthy by then anyway.

I've been a longtime fan of our Queen, the one and only Charlotte and I do mean a looong time, all the way back to naked man times.

So I created a reddit account just to share this story.

  
A few preambles before we get to the good stuff.

\- This is not my story, but a good friend who I introduced to Charlotte's youtube channel, had kindly asked me to share it for her.

\- Names have been changed.

Now buckle up buttercups, cause this one's a doozy.

  
Our heroine (22f at the time), let's call her Bailey, met this really cute girl in uni, lets call her Christina (21f) and felt an instant attraction to her. She thought she saw a little spark of interest back but like most lesbians, she gay panicked, it's a thing... so she didn't feel she got enough of a vibe from her, so they just remained friendly.

A few months into their friendship, and Bailey although typically an outgoing and direct person, hand't found a real chance to reveal her interest to Christina as she never really spoke much about anyone she was interested in, hence she didn't know if she was into women or not. She was quiet, shy and never revealed much about her private life. Bailey didn't mind that, as they were just getting to know eachother on a friendly level and some people are like that, they need to get to know someone to really open up. Also Christina never dated in uni, she was more focused on her studies, didn't drink at the parties and was never seen hooking up with anyone.

Their friendship grew and they would meet up with, always with other friends at parties and get togethers once or twice a week and such was their friendship throughout uni. Basically Bailey quietly pining away for Christina but never having the guts to express anything. As I'm sure most of our friendly neighbourhood queer ladies already know, pining is part of package issued with your lesbian card. We sit, staring across the room, sending gay bat signals with our eyeballs hoping the person we're trying to attract will come to us and be all... yes, I am of the queer, lets queer together.

  
Alas, Bailey graduated uni and moved back to her hometown and that effectively ended their friendship as they didn't keep in touch long distance, they were friendly but never got to a best friend status and Bailey had chickend out to ask to keep in touch.

Bailey had always wondered about what if she had been brave enough to say something to Christina and found herself often thinking about her throught the years after uni.

Fast forward 6 years later, Bailey now 30 and her brother, lets call him Tate (28M at the time), who was living in a different city, would return home for Christmas holidays and was bringing his fiance for everyone to finally meet.

Bailey and her brother didn't have a good relationship. He was always exrtemely jealous of her since they were children and him being the baby of the family was very much spoiled. He grew up to become quite the a-hole, often having multiple girlfriends at the same time, very much a red pill, podcast bro type of character and Bailey loathed spending any real time with him as he often made sexists and homophobic ""jokes"" all the time.

Sooo, Christmast time is upon as, and as you guessed it, Christina was by his side as he walked in. Bailey's mouth met the floor and Christina also looked quite taken aback by the reunion.

The two women hugged and laughed at the serendipity of it all, instantly reconnecting all the while Tate was eyeing them suspiciously not looking happy at all.

His first remarks were along the lines of, ""How the hell do you two know each other"" and ""Ease up on the touchy feely there, sis.""

As the day went on Bailey and Christina were glued to each other catching up with everything and of course Bailey was dying to know, how she ended up engaged to her shitty brother of all people but she knew she couldn't force the conversation too much, especially with Tate watching them both like a hawk.

By the end of the night, Bailey had to leave as she had her own place but Christina had asked to meet for coffee somewhere the next day. Tate invited himself along but Christina shot him down, saying she needed some girl time with Bailey to catch up and that he had something organized with his best man anyway so the coffee date was set.

The two women met for coffee and any other free moment they could as Tate was galavanting around town with his boys to have some bro time, so Christina seemed eager to do the same with Bailey and to start opening up to Bailey about how she ended up with Tate. 

To summerize, Christina had met Tate through her brother. She was never much interested in dating but had started feeling the pressure from her family to settle down and Tate seemed driven, and a take charge kind of guy and her brother and mother had really pushed for the two to get together. Tate as well was relentless with her, telling her she would become his wife from their first date, as he really wanted a ""pure"" woman to be his wife. They were together for 8 months before he had popped the question.

Bailey was shocked. She couldn't wrap her head around the idea of sweet, quiet and gentle Christina ending up with her Neanderthal brother. She tried to be happy about it but it just didn't feel right. Although Christina had opened up to her about how she met Tate, Bailey felt there was something Christina wasn't sharing with her. All she could do at this point was try to be there for her and hoped that maybe her brother had changed his ways since he moved away from home and was settling down.

They family would typically get together for dinners and that's when Bailey started noticing how Tate was treating Christina. He was very controlling, talking down on her, ordering her around like ""Babe, you don't see that I finished my beer?""

Bailey was appaled and tried to not react to it as when she did react Tate would become worse with his behaviour towards Christina.

During one of the dinners, when Tate actually put hands on Christina, he had grabbed her wrist very aggressively and was intimidating her, Bailey couldn't help reacting by shoving him back and confronting him about his shitty behaviour.

Shit went down! Tate started screaming at Bailey. ""I know what you're doing, and you better back off my woman!"" while Bailey was in his face screaming ""You sexist peace of shit, don't you put hands on her."" All the while Christina was crying begging them to stop till their parents came to separate them.

Tate demanded that Bailey leave but their parents had put a stop to the fight and calmed everyone down enough. After the dinner, which was awkward and full of snide remarks from Tate, Christina, to everyone's surprise asked to spend some time alone, that she would go to a hotel for that evening as she needed some time away from everything to calm down. Tate of course exploded into a rage again but both her partents for once had coralled him enough agreeing that maybe some time apart would settle things for everyone.

Another big surprise for Bailey came later that night when she received a text message from Christina, asking her to meet up at the hotel, as she needed to talk to her.

They sat at the bar and Christina fully opened up to her, telling her what Bailey had suspected, that Tate was abusive to her and she felt scared and trapped in the relationship. Bailey was furious and also worried for her but the biggest revalation to Bailey that sent her world spirilling into chaos was that one of the reasons she eventually said yes to dating Tate was that he reminded her so much of Bailey. As Bailey is more masculine presenting, she and Tate look quite similar to each other. Although Christina added he never had the kind eyes she always would remember for years after uni.

Bailey almost confessed that she had been very much interested in Christina at uni but she felt that wasn't the right time for that or if that time would ever arrive for them. Her first priority was Christina's well being so she gently navigated the conversation asking her what did she want to do in the end. Would she go ahead with the wedding?

Christina felt trapped and that as her whole family was pushing for the wedding and that if she dared to break the engagement, her parents would lose a lot of money as they were paying for a lot of the wedding venues and vendors and had already put heafty deposits down. Her family was very much money obsessed and she explained if she would break the engagement they would probably demand that she pay them the money back they lost so she resigned herself to marrying Tate and then probably divorcing him a few years later.

Bailey was horrified and vowed that she would try and help her come up with a solution. Christina wasn't convinced easily but after a while she agreed to hear Bailey out and think about things.

Bailey went back home and spent a few days away from Christina and Tate trying to come up with a solution. She had asked Christina to send her all the info on the vendors so she could tally up the whole amount of what she would have to pay.

She then asked Christina to have a phonecall with her family to see if that would even be the case, maybe if she told them the truth about the abuse, they wouldn't expect her to go forward with the wedding. She resisted fearing to confront them but she met Bailey at her house and called them putting them on speaker. To Bailey's horror the were not supportive of her leaving Tate, and her mother specifically blamed Christina, about Tate's behaviour, telling her she wasn't acting well enough to not anger her future husband.

That confrontation only lit a bigger fire under Bailey's ass. She would help this woman get out of this. The amount of money she would need for breaking the contracts with the vendors wasn't insurmountable and Bailey decided to use her savings. She had managed to make quite a heafty nest egg for herself as she was not in a relationship or had any children. She would wait to tell Christina as first she needed Christina to indeed want to end things with Tate.

  I'm a 19 years old woman from Hong Kong (UTC+8). I decided to post this, because:
1) I enjoy writing self intros.
2) I want people to share with me about their passions and creative projects :D


  I'm very curious and will ask a lot of questions (tho what I ask can be quite dumb sometimes).



**A bit of my lore**

- Like everyone else, I'm still figuring out what to do with life. I dropped out of high school due to mental health issues (to the point of wanting to su1c1de. thankfully I was dragged to a doctor some days before I really did it).
- Now I'm planning to complete night school. After getting my high school qualification, I will keep working to save up some money for an alternative path that is not college.



**Personality**
- I'll be honest, I have anger issues and moodswings. I'm still working on them because I don't wanna hurt the others and myself again
- Introverted, raw, honest, very sentimental, open-minded, curious. And I do try to be understanding



**Interests**
- Learning languages, standard German and Brazilian Portuguese
- Sewing countryballs. I also wanna try sewing small plushies after I get better at the basic techniques
- Reading books, something light-hearted, dark, or thought-provoking
- Remembering flags and countries on the world map 😛
- Swimming. But I haven't swim for about 5 months already, and I suck a lot lol
- Listening to any type of obscure gems of different genres
- Still creating my conlang, only about a dozen words ready :(



**Likes**
- *Raw and honest* people. Someone who knows or really tries to know themselves, and will stay in touch with and be true to thenselves
- Anything that is adorkable ><
- Cats, geckos, moths, rice weevils (yes), dark grey and yellow, coffee with milk (but I don't mind the quality much), small plushies, winter with sunlight, quiet and peace
- I currently listen to: doomy stoner rock (current most-listened-to genre), vintage music box (tho I hope the pitch is much lower), piano pop?, classical music sometimes, also any rock that sounds fun

1j740rf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j740rf/my_dead_brothers_old_friend_is_worrying_me_and_i/,my dead brother’s old friend is worrying me and i do not know what to do,"When I was 16 (F) (now 23) my brother died in a car accident. It was brutal. He was my only sibling. He was 18 years old. He was popular. He had a girlfriend and a large group of friends, most of which were from the same group- they were tight knit.
My brother was a kind person, and had also manage to find friends in other walks of life, some of which he met in detention at school, some of which had no friends of their own- they were not apart of his “popular” group at school, so he hung out with them separately- for drinks, or lunch, or coffee- outside of school hours.
(Btw I am so sorry if there’s any spelling or grammatical errors, i used voice to text to write this out as I couldn’t really find the words when typing).
This year in November, it will be eight years since he passed. Recently, one of his “other”  friends has started to display some concerning behaviours.  
Although it has been eight years, those to have lost a sibling or a child know the pain that my family feels. Some days we get on okay. Other days it feels like at the moment we found out he was gone all over again. 
To sum up, this person wasn’t close with my brother. He is a sweet boy who took classes with my brother, texted my brother, maybe even caught up with him once or twice. But I feel horrible in saying- he wasn’t “known” as a friend of his to my family or myself until after his passing. But for the past year, or so, he has sent me concerning messages. Messages on how he “sees my brother infront of him” and how he wants to see me in person for coffee or dinner to tell me the things my brother has told him in spirit. 
After my brother’s passing my family and I saw ladybirds as a symbol of him being around us. This person has now had a large ladybird tattooed on his arm. It sounds horrible without context, but he has been calling me and messaging me at all hours of the night, even at 2 am when my partner and I are sleep in our bed, asking if I have time for a phone call to talk about what my brother has been telling him. 
This makes me uncomfortable. But I must say I am not the kind of person to turn-away someone who I personally see, as in need of psychological help. It sounds wrong to say. I appreciate him thinking of my brother in this way- even going as far to get a tattoo in honour of him, but coming from someone who barely knew him, this is concerning. 
He has found my parents on Facebook- also messaging them asking to catch up for coffee or drink to “talk”.  Although my parents are adults and can make their own decisions, I feel protective- I don’t want them to sit down and listen to what I personally see as spiritual delusions. They are empathetic people, and I know this would upset them deeply, not due to my brother’s death, but due to a smart young man rambling on about his psychic abilities to see my brother talking to him. They care a lot for all people who knew him, who he loved- so to see one of them in this state would be confronting to them.
I am not a skeptic when it comes to the spiritual world, but if you knew all of the messages this person has sent me, you would see how I see it- he is not well, he does not sleep. He posts on social media about ladybirds and seeing my brother in them, constantly. He now has people who didn’t know my brother whatsoever sending him photos of ladybirds. He tells them *insert my brother’s name* is with them- people who didn’t know him whatsoever, he screenshots it and puts it on his story. He is making some kind of spiritual icon out of my brother and it makes me uncomfortable and upset.
I know, I need to tell him how I feel, how I feel his, turning my brother into some kind of martyr that he wasn’t, perhaps some of you will read this, and think that I should feel honoured or happy that someone is carrying on his legacy. But I am not comfortable with the fact that there are people out there, who didn’t know him who do not know us now see ladybirds and send them to this person and say that he’s with them when this person himself didn’t even know him well at all… A month ago, I found this person’s sister on Facebook and messaged her with my concerns for his mental health and obsession over my deceased brother. She was so empathetic and lovely and assured me that they were well aware of his situation as a family. I asked that my message to her remain anonymous as I would hate for him to think that I was “snitching” on him for something he clearly cannot help mentally- but the phone calls and messages have only persisted since.
I care for this boy, and I cannot help that- I care for him in the way I care for all the people who knew my beautiful brother. Due to my grief, I feel I cannot block him and I’ll wait to see his name on the news or in an article saying he took his life or something of the sort. But I cannot continue to play into this delusion, or tell him that we will catch up soon even though I truly do not want to, as I know what he will try to tell me will upset me. Any advice on what to tell him in a kind, caring way would be so appreciated.. i am at a loss currently.",1,1741512405.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

J’ai acheté il y’a 2 ans une Delonghi Dédicace EC695M parce que plusieurs sites disaient qu’elles se comportait bien pour une machine à moins de 200€. Je l’ai eu à 180€ sur un deal MaxiCoffee. N’ayant pas un gros budget je voulais une machine potable sans trop me ruiner.

J’aimerais avoir votre avis sur cette machine ?

Elle est livrée avec un filtre pressurisé mais j’ai vu plusieurs vidéos où les gens utilisent un porte filtre non pressuré et apparemment le goût du café est meilleur. 

J’utilise des cafés de supermarché à mouture fine pour percolateur mais souvent elle fait des siennes, le café ne coule pas (de la poudre vient boucher le filtre) ou alors le café coule trop lentement. Pourtant j’utilise la cuillère fournie. Ça me fait ça même avec des moutures plus épaisses.

Aussi le café est souvent amer, j’ai pas l’impression que l’extraction se fait correctement. J’ai réglé la température au maximum peut être que je devrais la réduire ? J’ai aussi l’impression que le plastique du porte filtre prend le goût de café cramé et que même si je le nettoie et laisse tramper dans le vinaigre au bout de 3 cafés ce problème revient.

Est ce que ça vaut vraiment le coup d’investir dans un porte filtre non pressurisé et quels sont les modèles compatibles avec cette machine ?

1j73x9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1j73x9k/m4f_rp_based_on_mickey_17_a_one_way_ticket/,(M4F) RP based on Mickey 17: A one way ticket,"
This is an RP based on the new film Mickey 17. The basic premise is this:

In a future where humanity has expanded into the stars, interstellar colonization is a brutal and unforgiving endeavor. The wealthiest corporations spearhead these ventures, using advanced cloning technology to create Expendables—workers who take on the riskiest, deadliest tasks with the promise of resurrection via cloning whenever they die. These Expendables are not considered people in the traditional sense, just replaceable assets, printed and discarded as needed.

Alex Kane is one such Expendable. With no ties left on Earth—his family fractured or gone, his purpose uncertain—he signs on for a deep-space mission to a distant colony. He’s not excited about the job, exactly, but he figures it doesn’t matter. If he dies, they’ll print a new him, and if he keeps going long enough, maybe he’ll stop caring about which version of him is real.

As the crew prepares to leave Earth for good, Alex meets (Y/C), another member of the expedition. Unlike him, she seems steady, experienced—someone who belongs in space, while he’s just figuring it out. Maybe she’s an engineer, a scientist, a soldier, or something else entirely, but she doesn’t seem fazed by what he is. She sees him in a way most people don’t, and that unsettles him more than he wants to admit.

Starter:
The launchpad was alive with activity—voices overlapping in hurried commands, the whir of machinery, the occasional burst of steam hissing from the shuttle’s underbelly. This was the last stop. The final stretch before Alex Kane left Earth behind for good.

And somehow, he didn’t feel much of anything.

No fear, no excitement. Just a quiet, dull acceptance.

He shifted his duffel higher on his shoulder, watching as the crew made their final checks. The ship towered over him, sleek and sterile, its hull reflecting the last fading light of day. This was it. The last sky he’d ever see.

Not that there was much waiting for him here.

Earth had stopped feeling like home a long time ago.

He had no one left. No real ties. His family had fractured long before they ever had the chance to be whole. His parents—gone. His brother? He hadn’t spoken to him in years. They were strangers now, bound only by shared blood and old wounds neither of them had bothered to mend.

So when the contract came through—when he saw the job listing for Expendable—it had been an easy choice. A guaranteed out. No messy goodbyes, no funeral needed if something went wrong. Just a seamless transition from one body to the next, like hitting reset on a faulty machine.

Maybe that was the real draw. He didn’t have to worry about what came next. Didn’t have to be him anymore. Just a fresh copy, over and over, until eventually, it didn’t matter which version was real.

The thought made his chest tighten, so he shoved it down, burying it beneath the usual bravado.

That’s when he saw her. (Y/C).

She was leaning against a supply crate, coffee in hand—where did she even get coffee out here?—watching the chaos unfold with a steady, practiced ease. She didn’t look nervous, didn’t look excited either. Just… grounded. Like she belonged.

Unlike him.

Alex took a breath and walked over, stopping just close enough to be casual but not weird. First impressions mattered, right? He should say something cool, something confident.

Instead, what came out was:

“So, uh… this your first time dying, or just another Tuesday?”

He immediately regretted it.

(Y/C) turned her head slightly, raising an eyebrow. A beat of silence stretched between them before she took a slow sip of her coffee, then finally responded.

“Bold opener.”

Alex forced a grin, shifting his bag. “Yeah, figured why waste time with small talk? We’re about to spend a few years stuck in a metal can together. Might as well cut to the existential dread.”

She studied him for a moment, her gaze sharp—assessing. Like she was peeling back layers without even trying. It made him want to fidget, but he held his ground.

Then, to his relief, she smirked. “Guess that depends on how expendable you are.”

Alex let out a breathy chuckle, rubbing the back of his neck. “Yeah, about that… I’m one of them.” He gestured vaguely toward the Expendables checking in. “Freshly printed, shiny and new. Though, technically, still me.”

(Y/C) didn’t look surprised. “Makes sense.”

He blinked. “Wait, really? No weird reaction? No ‘oh wow, you’re okay with being cloned like an office printer jam?’”

She shrugged. “Everyone’s got a job. Yours just happens to come with a backup plan.”

Alex studied her for a second, then huffed a quiet laugh. “That’s… surprisingly practical. You always this chill?”

(Y/C) smirked, taking another sip. “Guess you’ll find out.”

Before he could respond, the intercom crackled overhead, calling for final boarding. The last stragglers started moving toward the shuttle, their voices fading into the hum of the engines warming up.

Alex exhaled, glancing up at the sky one last time.

No turning back.

His grip tightened on his bag as he looked at (Y/C) again. “So, what’s your deal? Veteran spacer? Engineer? Mysterious woman who knows more than she lets on?”

(Y/C) glanced toward the shuttle, then back at him, eyes glinting with something unreadable. “Maybe a little of everything.”

Alex grinned. “Great. I love a good mystery.”

And with that, they stepped onto the shuttle—one last look at Earth behind them, and nothing but the void ahead.",1,1741511972.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

In a future where humanity has expanded into the stars, interstellar colonization is a brutal and unforgiving endeavor. The wealthiest corporations spearhead these ventures, using advanced cloning technology to create Expendables—workers who take on the riskiest, deadliest tasks with the promise of resurrection via cloning whenever they die. These Expendables are not considered people in the traditional sense, just replaceable assets, printed and discarded as needed.

Alex Kane is one such Expendable. With no ties left on Earth—his family fractured or gone, his purpose uncertain—he signs on for a deep-space mission to a distant colony. He’s not excited about the job, exactly, but he figures it doesn’t matter. If he dies, they’ll print a new him, and if he keeps going long enough, maybe he’ll stop caring about which version of him is real.

As the crew prepares to leave Earth for good, Alex meets (Y/C), another member of the expedition. Unlike him, she seems steady, experienced—someone who belongs in space, while he’s just figuring it out. Maybe she’s an engineer, a scientist, a soldier, or something else entirely, but she doesn’t seem fazed by what he is. She sees him in a way most people don’t, and that unsettles him more than he wants to admit.

Starter:
The launchpad was alive with activity—voices overlapping in hurried commands, the whir of machinery, the occasional burst of steam hissing from the shuttle’s underbelly. This was the last stop. The final stretch before Alex Kane left Earth behind for good.

And somehow, he didn’t feel much of anything.

No fear, no excitement. Just a quiet, dull acceptance.

He shifted his duffel higher on his shoulder, watching as the crew made their final checks. The ship towered over him, sleek and sterile, its hull reflecting the last fading light of day. This was it. The last sky he’d ever see.

Not that there was much waiting for him here.

Earth had stopped feeling like home a long time ago.

He had no one left. No real ties. His family had fractured long before they ever had the chance to be whole. His parents—gone. His brother? He hadn’t spoken to him in years. They were strangers now, bound only by shared blood and old wounds neither of them had bothered to mend.

1j73ucb,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1j73ucb/why_do_mombies_think_that_everything_revolves/,Why do mombies think that everything revolves around their child?,"I had such a stupid argument in an all-inclusive hotel yesterday that I just have to get it off my chest here and would like to hear your opinion on it.

You have to imagine I'm standing at one of the several hotel bars where you can order a snack. I stand in the queue and tell my husband to find a seat nearby. When it's my turn, I order two sandwiches for us, which are ready to go in the display case, and a coffee. 

The waiter behind the counter was alone, so he gives me my sandwiches and presses the button on the coffee machine and tells me I can pick up my cappuccino in a minute. I take the plates, walk a few steps to the table where my husband is sitting and put the sandwiches down. To pick up my cappuccino, I turn around and stand at the side of the counter (to the left of the queue) to wait a little longer until the coffee is ready. 

Suddenly a woman from the right shouted at me, asking what kind of person I was for daring to jump the queue with a child. I was so perplexed that I didn't understand what she wanted. I didn't say anything for a second, which could have made it look like I wanted to order something else. So I have no idea how she even got the idea. Only then did I see that there was a little boy in front on the right who seemed to want to order something.

Out of reflex that she was shouting at me, I told her in a very loud voice that I already ordered, had put my sandwiches on the table and was just waiting for my cappuccino (which she should have seen if she had been standing behind me in the queue...). So she should please not shout at me like that...

Funny, suddenly no more sound came out of her mouth. No apologies, nothing. The waiter gives me my cappuccino, I thank him and turn around to go back to my table. Then suddenly other guests start making stupid comments about the bad mood on vacation... and I just think to myself, yes, ask that unrelaxed, stupid mother, not me! 

Thank God, it was shortly before departure and for me it's now clear: next vacation I will only stay at a adult only hotel! 

Nonetheless, I really wonder what is wrong with humanity, especially frustrated mothers, that they freak out for no reason in an all-inclusive hotel where there is food and drink on  literally every corner.

Imagine if times were to change... would they then become completely furious? 🙄

Wanted to share thats all!,"There’s a mini snack centre below my apartment. I go there every Sunday for my breakfast. It always smells of fresh vegetables, hot tea and chatter. 

I noticed one such summer. At exactly 8 AM, a pretty lady comes there. She orders exactly one plate of idli, no chutney, and a cup of filtered coffee—sometimes a parcel, sometimes to eat. I don’t like idli; it tastes dry and spongey to my palette. 

I always wanted to confront her about the odd but straight pattern, maybe even get her number. 

But I never could. Sometimes I came late, or she came earlier. But on the times when we ordered at same time, I couldn’t muster my courage. I always told myself “next weekend”.

 A dozen such weekends passed. I tried all sorts of combinations—everything but idli. Never the idli.

Then came the winters. She stopped visiting. 
A few months passed. I kept going there routinely, exactly at 8 AM. But she didn’t. And one fine spring day, she came. Something had changed; her hair was different. A ring had popped on her finger, and her order had changed. It is now two plates of idli and two cups of coffee. In fact, she orders something new every Sunday. And I just sit there, amusing myself with a plate of Idli and coffee. I suppose the dryness of idli and the spices of sambhar play well. 

I like the idli now.",2,1741511254.0,TeenIndia,2,1.0,False

\[DRAMATIC NETFLIX LOGO.\]

\[FADE IN: A close-up shot of an overcast Montecito sky. An upbeat, old-timey song springs to life alongside a clearing; a tree stump; fluttering chickens; and a column of smoke rising from a campfire. “*A Netflix Series*” appears like the fine sear of a stamp of approval, reminding you of when times were better.\]

\[CUT TO: A fist swoops a blade into a rooster’s head.\]

MEGHAN (*wiping her brows*). “So even though I’m a pet owner, I can compartmentalize.”

The rooster’s wings flutter involuntarily. A hand tosses the head into a slop bucket.

MEGHAN. “The love we have for our pets; they’re all we have.” (*Laughs as she sets down her hatchet.*) “This one’s for dinner though.”

The upbeat music continues.

\[CUT TO: A close-up shot of “Archie’s Chick Inn,” designed not to remind you of the “Before Times” in *Chicken Run*.\]

MEGHAN (*voiceover*). “It’s not like, you know, what ‘problematic people’ would say about—right? You’d never see me doing this to a—”

\[CUT TO: The blade swoops down again.\]

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN’s eyes, filled with wonder.\]

\[CUT TO: A close-up of gardenias in the meadow.\]

MUSIC. “♫ *In your will—I see a soul so strong…*”

MEGHAN (*smiling, chatting with someone off-camera)*. “When you go into the coop, you can really feel—” (*eyes concentrated, scanning*) “—like a ‘thrum,’ almost, of something larger than yourself; you can really feel this sense of, ‘otherworldly connection’ almost, to some ‘shared pulse of life.’”

The music intensifies.

\[CUT TO: A young chick flaps its wings in the coop.\]

MEGHAN (*whispering*). “Like little fetal heartbeats all around.”

A shot of the forest. This episode isn’t playing around.

\[CUT TO: A close-up of Meghan’s eyes. They’re raw; frightened.\]

MEGHAN (*smiling*). “I mean, are we supposed to starve? Give up our tasties? Live as if we’re reduced? On a communist compound? We can’t even be pretty? All art is equal?” (*Looks up.*) “No.”

MUSIC. “♫ *Glory, She’s in your eyes…*”

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN’s interview next to the stump.\]

MICHAEL (*off-camera*). “What do you want for the world.”

MEGHAN. “Michael, it’s so funny you keep asking me that, and I’m just going to be so straightforward with you: I want everyone in the world to have what I have. And, honestly, ‘Michael’? If only you knew the ‘real story’? I’d want even better for you. My grandmother knew.”

The old-timey music continues, as the camera pans out to reveal MEGHAN in a leather bomber, a Western shirt, and blue jeans, clutching a hatchet, surveying a spread of decapitated chickens on a repurposed yoga mat.

MICHAEL (*off-camera*). “Love—”

MEGHAN (*smiling*). “—is a veneer for this.”

MICHAEL (*off-camera*). “And you’re sure.”

MEGHAN (*condescending*). “Oh I’m quite sure, Michael.”

MICHAEL (*off-camera*). “And you think that’s relatable.”

MEGHAN (*angry*). “Do I? Yes.”

MUSIC. “♫ *You came to me, like a duck in fright…*”

MEGHAN (*to someone off-camera*). “So my arch-nemesis Colson Lin is stopping by today, and I thought I’d make him an ‘honesty’ bomb.” (*Grinning.*) “How do socialists *really* feel about stainless-steel applicances?“

\[CUT TO: A Polaroid of an Asian kid in Houston.\]

MEGHAN (*sympathetically*). “Colson’s kitchen growing up, he says, was covered in vegetable oil residue and dead cockroaches.”

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN, in a gray sundress, twirling in slow-motion in a garden—a crisp blue sky, gold bracelets clinking—as dandelions float across a dress that allures like an address. This is *The White Lotus*.\]

MEGHAN (*voiceover*). “It’s okay to feel in awe of, natural reality. Trees. That there’s a shoreline. You can see the sky—it’s not, look, it’s not a ceiling like your apartment? All this grass; we’re on a cliffside. Sometimes clouds mist in, but we just—“ \[*blows*\] “—shoo them away. It’s okay; it’s not a big deal, some of us just enjoy nature. That doesn’t mean we’re out to hurt the cityfolk, right? We just like normalcy.”

\[CUT TO: A flash of lightning, rolling thunder in the distance.\]

***WITH LOVE, MEGHAN***

\[CUT TO: *With Love, Meghan*’s title sequence: a 21st-century aristocrat harvesting strawberries, carving chickens, tilling the field. There’s a sense M’s weathered a storm, and it’s been overcome, but more is coming. (Colson was wrong about something, but was it the ‘moon bump’?) Lingering like a precision inside every frame: shots of the sky appear to show gray clouds hovering. A timeless wind entangles: whose wounds we’ll prick open, and what equalities remain; surreal parables, that’s all fiction amounts to.\]

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN approaches a Breville in the kitchen.\]

MEGHAN (*to someone off-camera*). “I just wanted a simple life. Do you want coffee? Are you not going to have some coffee?”

A kitchen this modern, with windows this open, can only mean one thing.

MICHAEL (*off-camera*). “Okay.”

MEGHAN (*giggling*). “I mean I couldn’t sleep last night; and not because.”

\[CUT TO: A close-up of a white countertop that you could spin freshly-peeled eggs on. Butter crinkles into oil in a stovetop pan.\]

MEGHAN (*frying bacon*). “You know that feeling; when you don’t know why but you just have a pit in your stomach, and it follows you around?”

In a Jackie O. dress, white, sleeveless, with a J. Crew striped white-and-beige cardigan wrapped around her shoulders, MEGHAN tosses chicken wings into a pan. The kitchen has a natural island backdropped by windows with a view of an atmospheric garden. The floor is black polished hardwood. There’s enough space between the island and the stovetop to dance in.

MEGHAN. “Bacon and eggs—that’s Colson’s thing. He’s all ‘classic Americana.’”

MICHAEL (*off-camera*). “Are you, are you nervous about…”

MEGHAN (*turns around*). “Hm? I’m fine.”

The camera pans across a clean, well-maintained Montecito kitchen.

MEGHAN (*to herself*). “If he wants to say I ‘smile’ too much, you can tell him it’s called having ‘manners’? We’re not here, right, just to smear our doom and gloom over everyone’s spreads like we can’t have nice bagels? We’re here to be ‘civil,’ do things by the book; rules exist for a reason.”

\[CUT TO: A sprinkle of salt into the pan.\]

MEGHAN (*raising a cup of espresso*). “Cheers.”

Smiling, MEGHAN knocks back a cup of brew with MICHAEL, who’s barely in the shot. As she sips, MEGHAN glances sideways with an ironic smile.

MEGHAN. “You know our beans, were extracted, by people we know?”

MICHAEL. “Get out of here!”

MEGHAN (*sipping from her cup*). “So one thing you’ll notice is—when I was growing up? We respected royalty; we respected dignity, refinement, elegance, and manners. That’s, you know—you just have to ‘see where the eyeballs are’? That’s—wisdom from the ancient moms: ‘The have-nots, as it turns out, aspired mainly to having.’ So, it’s not about—‘envy,’ right?”

MICHAEL. “You know, on Saturdays; we can think about that kind of stuff.”

MEGHAN. “Really? What do you—what do you, think about?”

UNIDENTIFIED VOICE. “Colson’s here.”

\[CUT TO: COLSON walks in, gray polo sweater, white shorts. It’s like being invited to the popular kid’s house as they’re having a downfall.\]

COLSON. “Hi. Thank you, for having me here.”

MEGHAN (*smiling, direct eye contact*). “You know, you’re so welcome?”

COLSON (*humble nod*). “Thank you.”

MEGHAN. “Well, have a seat anywhere!”

COLSON. “Thanks.”

MEGHAN. “Have you seen a nice kitchen like this before?”

COLSON. “Once or twice in my life.”

MEGHAN. “So I have a gift for you.”

\[CUT TO: A really well-done gift set is presented. Next to the kitchen island, COLSON’s twirling on a stool; MEGHAN’s behind a stove.\]

COLSON (*receiving it*). “Oh wow, thanks.”

MEGHAN (*making direct eye contact*). “I know you like ‘honesty,’ so I got you Honesty Bath Bombs; because you’re always in the bathtub!”

COLSON (*to himself*). “I’ll actually use these.”

MEGHAN. “Isn’t that great?”

COLSON. “Thank you!”

MEGHAN. “Don’t even mention it!”

COLSON (*still giddy*). “So I don’t know, what I could say, led there like a horse to water, that couldn’t be presented later without context, so I just want to YELL THAT UPFRONT.”

MEGHAN turns from the stove and laughs.

COLSON (*charismatically*). “Now it’s MUST-SEE TV.”

\[CUT TO: The crew applauds.\]

MEGHAN (*still laughing*). “So I think it’s great how you’re always talking about—how you think things are? I think it’s just really important to clarify at the outset: I’m not the first rich person you ever met.”

COLSON shakes his head.

MEGHAN. “And do you feel sort of like a—‘fish out of water’?”

COLSON. “Well, yeah.”

MEGHAN (*frowning, pointing in circles*). “We’re in one fish bowl, honey.”

COLSON. “I’m not really like, hierarchal—”

MEGHAN (*stares*). “I mean, what do think this is?”

COLSON. “Um.”

MEGHAN. “Your first job was Jamba Juice; wasn’t it?”

COLSON. “Yeah.”

MEGHAN. “So if we had worked together at Jamba Juice; you wouldn’t be happy for me?”

COLSON. “I mean—I’d be fine.”

\[CUT TO: A close-up of Thai chili chicken wings, bacon, and eggs in a pan.\]

MEGHAN (*turns around*). “Want some water? Oops; I already know you said no—I’m so sorry, I can’t help it!”

COLSON. “You’re good.”

MEGHAN. “It’s just; whenever I see someone who doesn’t have a refreshment—my mind goes haywire.”

COLSON. “What, are you doing?”

MEGHAN (*turns around, holding up a jar*). “Oh; they’re flower sprinkles! Have you ever put them on chicken wings before?”

COLSON. “No, never.”

MEGHAN. “What!”

COLSON. “That’s crazy.”

MEGHAN (*walking over to Colson*). “If you had kids, you’d get it!”

Leaning over the kitchen island, MEGHAN’s now holding a spoonful of flower sprinkles directly in front of COLSON’s mouth.

MEGHAN. “Here, you have to try this.”

COLSON (*after a pause*). “Um; okay?”

In one swift motion, COLSON gobbles up the flower sprinkles from MEGHAN’s spoon.

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN’s eyes widen as she smiles.\]

MEGHAN. “Isn’t that incredible!”

\[CUT TO: Olive oil streaming into a pan from the metal nub of a glass container.\]

MEGHAN. “A lot of how I approach, ‘decadence,’ right, is I compare it to ‘using olive oil when you’re not supposed to’?” (*Laughs.*) “I know it sounds ‘crazy,’ but I found that with so many recipes that always ‘sound so high-end on a menu,’ they can actually be replicated, at home—much more affordably, mind you—with just a little splash of olive oil! Right? I call it ‘that surprise splash of olive oil’? And so—if I’m picking out an outfit or I’m hired to do a floral arrangement for my kids, and I’m debating whether or not I really need that ‘one last accessory’? Right, I ask myself: is this like ‘splashing olive oil into Sabra to elevate game night’; or is it, even one step beyond that?”

COLSON. “Right. I mean, this house.”

MEGHAN. “Oh, Montecito was inspired by the Olive Garden—olive gardens; Italy—” \[*closes eyes*\] “—so you can actually—instead of vacations, I just walk outside. All the time.”

Her eyes fume.

COLSON. “Right. And did you—did you find yourself, having to splash ‘olive oil,’ onto an inferior situation to—”

MEGHAN. “Oh, to get this house? This house was like 5,000% olive oil.”

COLSON. “Right.”

MEGHAN. “Yeah, but we—do you not understand yet that if we didn’t live here, an oligarch would?”

COLSON. “I—I’m not from your world.”

MEGHAN. “This house—is—like a medina in an ancient tranquility.”

COLSON. “I mean they all are; on cooking shows.”

MEGHAN. “And I just thought, you know; if you can come from out of nowhere like I did, and have something nice—I mean, isn’t that just all of us?”

COLSON. “I don’t know, I really didn’t think about it that much.”

\[CUT TO: An egg timer goes off.\]

MEGHAN (*breaks out into laughter*). “Oh my gosh—the chicken’s ready!”

\[CUT TO: Two plates of chili-speckled chicken wings.\]

COLSON (*taking a bite*). “It’s, yeah.”

MEGHAN (*smiling intensely while making eye contact*). “Isn’t it good?”

COLSON (*putting a napkin to lips*). “Yeah, really good.”

MEGHAN. “So you’ve already been on my podcast.”

COLSON. “Right.”

MEGHAN. “And now you’re doin’ my lifestyle show.”

COLSON. “Right.”

MEGHAN. “But only in your head.”

COLSON (*puts down the napkin*). “Correct.”

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN pops open a champagne bottle.\]

MEGHAN. “So last night I couldn’t sleep, so I went on a juice-squeezing frenzy. See that jar of pineapple juice over there?” (*Points to the kitchen island, while walking to the refrigerator.*) “That’s just the beginning.”

MEGHAN opens up the fridge.

MEGHAN. “I literally have twenty centuries’ worth of pineapple juice.”

COLSON. “Whoa.”

MEGHAN shuts the fridge.

MEGHAN. “So we’re like a normal family, right? ‘Don’t believe everything you see on HBO.’ Colson; I have something else for you. Are you ready?”

COLSON. “Ready.”

MEGHAN (*spins around, holding a jar*). “I made some preserves for you!”

COLSON. “Thank you!”

MEGHAN (*laughing*). “And look, the lids—I painted them like little lifesavers.”

COLSON (*after a pause*). “Oh! Because I like the *Titani*c.”

\[CUT TO: A how-to segment’s title screen slides in: “*How to Be Considerate*.”\]

MEGHAN (*to someone off-camera*). “So a lot of things go into the concept of ‘tact,’ right—I feel like, you know, if I’m actually a thoughtful person, it’s sort of my responsibility to make sure everyone’s having a good time, right?”

\[CUT TO: A montage of B-rolls—pastel cakes, Thai chili flakes.\]

MEGHAN (*to someone off-camera*). “So many people, I think, have an idea of what rich people enjoy? And now that I’ve seen it for myself, I can tell you—we enjoy it when everybody shares our values. It’s kind of like—it’s kind of like *The Godfather*, right? You want to make sure nobody’s rockin’ the boat—so that’s where ‘tact’ comes in, it *separates*, it *sieves*, the ones who have tact, from, you know, those without. And at the end of the day; if you’re in God’s castle? You have to play by God’s rules of the game—and that’s sharing our values, about how to behave. And that’s being considerate.”

Doo-wop transition.

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN and COLSON conversing in the Montecito kitchen.\]

MEGHAN. “So; right? I’m just showing you—some of the things you’ll need; if you want to reach—” (*reaching for chili flakes*) “—the people here?”

COLSON. “Right.”

MEGHAN. “And rule number one: be considerate.”

COLSON. “I don’t speak rich people.”

MEGHAN. “No, no—the non-rich have to be considerate too.”

COLSON. “Right.”

\[CUT TO: A blender full of diced pineapples.\]

MEGHAN (*turning on the blender*). “We’re all, just trying—to co-exist.”

The blender whirls on.

MEGHAN. “Colson, have you ever felt ‘pushed to your limits’ before?”

COLSON. “All the time.”

MEGHAN. “Then you know what it feels like, if the stakes are high.”

COLSON. “Yeah.”

MEGHAN (*stops the blender*). “Do you want to go outside? And meet some of the chickens?”

\[CUT TO: A slow-pan across lucid blades of grass, dominated by fluttering dews of lavender; and COLSON and MEGHAN, walking barefoot across Montecito.\]

MEGHAN. “What are you trying to accomplish, Colson?”

COLSON. “Um, peace.”

MEGHAN. “Just ‘peace’?”

COLSON. “Just; an honest reckoning if ever more can be reckoned with. I don’t know. I feel like ‘reality’ got us to something ‘intense.’ And it’s rare? And it’s—there’s so much, inside of ‘care’? I guess, we—I don’t know.”

MEGHAN. “Take your time.”

COLSON. “I don’t know what anything is really; I feel like I’m just, both ‘formed by stimuli’ and constantly reacting to it at the same time you know?”

MEGHAN. “Like, you’re in the moment? Right, I’m following.”

COLSON. “I think ‘care’s’ probably really like, foundational and sacred; like it’s something that both can come naturally and can be nurtured? And I feel like, in some ways, it’s been decayed for us; like, there are ways to sort of, both, sustain the image of caring, while emptyin’ its depth…”

MEGHAN. “Care is sacred.”

COLSON. “Right, and—maybe like, it’s decaying in a way? Like care is hollowing out from the inside…?”

MEGHAN (*opening the chicken coop*). “Like the shell of care’s still there.”

COLSON. “Right, but in a way that’s like, you know—”

MEGHAN (*entering the coop, calling over the hens*). “We all care about different things, so what are we going to do about that?” (*looks up*) “You can’t just, like—stare into the core of caring and pretend like it’s yours.”

COLSON. “But it can’t be all about ‘what you feel in the moment’ either, because that shifts so variably over the course of stimuli; unreliably.”

MEGHAN (*gazing at a hen*). “I mean—do they, though? Aren’t you undervaluing how much ‘intuition’ can take over and do all the work?”

COLSON. “You mean.”

MEGHAN (*smiling at a hen*). “Sometimes you just have a ‘sense,’ right, of what you care about; and what you don’t? What feels right?”

COLSON. “You mean intuition.”

MEGHAN. “I mean intuition! You follow what you feel, and if what you feel leads you to, feeling attached—”

COLSON. “We have to know if anything can be sacred; and if it can, we have to know what they are and how our access might decay. I don’t know. It’s actually the nature of love, the core of love—‘care.’ But like—the kind that can truly empty you, you know? I mean. There’s just something, right, that can charge the air with your inner shivers; and it’s sacred. Intense. Rare?”

MEGHAN. “What’s—what’d be a graceful way of treating rarity?”

COLSON. “I don’t know, sensing it? Letting yourself ‘feel’ it? Or just remembering it, too. Knowing how small you are at the feet of heights. That feeling, ‘fear’—it accompanies your sense of, I don’t know… I don’t know. Just ‘the real world,’ I guess; the sense that who you love, can sink, here; or that they’ve been sinkin’ from the start. Like our psyches weren’t rigged for this ‘background radiation,’ maybe, painting what things can feel like.”

MEGHAN (*making faces at a hen*). “But we all share fear.”

COLSON. “We all share fears in common, right, like so much of history was rhythmed by that—some ancient core of ‘care’; plus all of our rhyming fears.”

MEGHAN. “So I mean, what does that—where do you go with that.”

COLSON. “I think ‘hope can sustain the difference’?”

MEGHAN. “You think ‘hope’ can ‘sustain’ the ‘difference.’ What—like, if you experience ‘hope’ instead of ‘fear’; you’ll make better decisions?”

COLSON. “Not necessarily. I just think; sort of, like—even gettin’ this far, you know, like the lights turn on, things just sorted out, maybe. I don’t know.”

MEGHAN. “Do you think humanity gets any better with nobody’s help?”

COLSON. “Or we can just, ‘see authenticity as sacred’?”

MEGHAN. “And that’s all of us all the time, isn’t it?”

COLSON. “I s’pose so.”

\[CUT TO: Thunder rumbles into the chicken coop. It’s overcast now. A dull gust stripes MEGHAN’s hair across her face.\]

COLSON. “We share this, I guess, ‘experience of being alive,’ with anyone who shares it, you know?”

MEGHAN. “Right, we share a ‘first-person experience’…”

COLSON. “I just feel like, if ‘sacred values’ exist, maybe, nurturin’ them while we still can, can maybe prepare us better, for more grown-up challenges…”

The hen starts rapidly flailing in MEGHAN’s arms.

COLSON. “And ‘good timing’—wishin’ for that, maybe. Not consciously. Hoping it exists, teleologically, transcendently, I don’t know. It could help us—hold on to hope.”

MEGHAN (*eyes closed as the hen’s wings flap*). “So like blind faith.”

\[CUT TO: A bird’s-eye-view of the rocky Montecito coastline.\]

Gospel-inspired music.

\[CUT TO: It’s the outdoors again—close-ups of pastel dahlias swaying in Montecito’s afternoon sun. COLSON and MEGHAN sit at the kitchen island.\]

MEGHAN (*sipping tea*). “I think the thing is, right—we have systems?”

COLSON (*drinking tea*). “Mm-hmm.”

MEGHAN. “And so you go to school; you do, ‘after-school activities,’ you participate in tests and exams; you’re trained, you know, to succeed.”

COLSON. “Right, by your ‘culture.’”

MEGHAN. “Right; and then by whatever social atmosphere surrounds you—and whatever you happen to feel, right, in your moment-to-moment life?”

COLSON. “Sculpting our intuitions.”

MEGHAN. “Our intuitions, right? Like just your basic cares.”

COLSON. “Plus everything we’re indifferent about.”

MEGHAN. “And that’s everyone!”

COLSON. “So by the time you’re put to work.”

MEGHAN (*claps hands*). “Right, by the system—job-hunting, auditioning, kissin’ ass to anyone who can help you, it’s all the same thing—you either end up exactly where you ought to be; or you become disaffected.”

COLSON. “And that’s when you—”

MEGHAN. “‘Disassociate.’ You’re just winning points for your family at that point.”

COLSON. “Which is what everyone’s doing.”

MEGHAN. “Exactly—your children are your heirs! We inherited everything we didn’t marry into by working hard and contributing to a machine that’s flooded with capital. And it started with—right; education? And it ends with.”

COLSON. “Right.”

MEGHAN. “More education!”

COLSON. “Right.”

MEGHAN. “I’m just doing what I can to keep the economy stable.”

Energetic R&B.

\[CUT TO: A bird’s-eye-view of scones, encircled by tea cups.\]

MEGHAN. “So I’m a mom, right? And what I really want is for my children to have what we inherited—our ‘conveniences,’ right? Our sense that; even if there’s a rainstorm out there, at least in here, there’s reliable shelter? We weren’t born into nightfall; forced to navigate foreign human psyches in the darkness. We were—we hopped into ‘clothes’ that were already here; into homes that were already there; drove on roads that were already paved.”

COLSON. “Well, I paved my own path through the internet.”

MEGHAN. “Right, and so what? So would Socrates; or anyone with wi-fi.”

COLSON. “When I was a child, it was intuitive to share with the least of us. That’s how I felt, and I’m glad. I’m glad.”

MEGHAN. “But where do you draw the line, Colson?”

COLSON. “I don’t know. Space-time?”

MEGHAN (*laughing*). “Or, we can just share with our most vaunted peers.”

COLSON. “‘Every tribe for itself’ is an energy in the air.”

MEGHAN. “We’re scared as fuck, Colson.”

COLSON. “I just feel like fear, distrust, hierarchy—I don’t know, plus it’s a recognizable dystopia? Maybe ‘before self-recognition,’ or it was all a haze.”

MEGHAN. “Hey—eyes down here, helicopter. What’s your solution here?”

COLSON. “I don’t know: ‘Sacred is the essence of sharing’?”

MEGHAN. “Like there’s something ‘sacred’ about the ‘essence of sharing’?”

COLSON. “Right—which connects to everything?”

MEGHAN. “But everyone who’s rich gets to stay rich through dynasty lineages.”

COLSON. “Right. For what?”

MEGHAN. “For what we’re handing down.”

COLSON. “Right. Just as—”

MEGHAN. “Just as people who showed up.”

COLSON. “Right. The lottery of birth.”

MEGHAN. “We’re just the heartbeats that showed up.”

COLSON. “We’re just the heartbeats that showed up.”

Cozy, old-timey music. MEGHAN and COLSON are back in the kitchen, baking goodbye cookies for COLSON.

MEGHAN. “So when I was pregnant, right, I craved cookies both times?”

MUSIC. “♫ *If it looks like a tango—must be a tango…*”

MEGHAN’s sprinkling flower petals over little balls of dough.

MEGHAN. “So as you know, even people you don’t think are good, can be good. Wrapped underneath centuries and centuries of bad directions; new directions; good directions; and misdirections, there’s sometimes reason? Patience? I love the translucence of patience; it’s like a clarity, as you wait for a garden to grow. It’s not the impatient we despise; it’s the impatience.”

COLSON. “Mm.”

MEGHAN. “I’ve always just loved, taking something like love—and elevating it?”

COLSON. “Love is always in the air.”

MEGHAN. “It’s like in every TV show, right, and every book; every movie, every cultural artifact? Sex! Money! And right below that? ‘Love!’”

COLSON. “Plus political commentary.”

MEGHAN. “Right—and so do you think, Colson, when future civilizations examine America; be they ‘alien’ or ‘human’ or ‘AI’; they might…”

COLSON. “They’d probably figure out ‘care’ undergirds ‘reason itself’; like ‘reason’ carried our self-understanding, but there’s like—trust, care, and depth, right? ‘Gratitude for all we ever felt love for’? Or sheltered by trust, or nurtured by care? Or just the lights turning on? I don’t know.”

MEGHAN. “So you’re saying—we have a lot ‘dysfunctions,’ and maybe we haven’t always given each other enough ‘reasons’ to be grateful for each other’s presence?”

COLSON. “I mean, you try lookin’ for reasons to be grateful for everyone reality spits out at you.”

MEGHAN. “But like—if we auto-pilot our lives, on an image of ‘*depth*’…”

COLSON. “We could collapse hopes inside and out, the world over.”

MEGHAN (*taken aback*). “Oh my goodness, so it’s like a constant struggle, right? A constant ‘tension’—landing on a relationship’s stable ‘meaning’ is sort of like—” (*looks up from the baking tray and laughs*) “—knowing when to finish sprinklin’ flower petals over cookies.”

COLSON. “It’s like an intuition, I guess!”

MEGHAN (*still laughing, holding up a tray of cookies*). “Do you think that’s quite enough?”

COLSON (*laughing*). “Holy shit.”

MEGHAN. “Do you think I overdid it with the petals?”

COLSON. “Girl, you love petals.”

MEGHAN. “I just thought, why shouldn’t cookies remind you of jasmine?”

MUSIC. “♫ *If it points like an angle—must be an angle…*”

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN in a strapless gown, taking a bite of a sugar cookie.\]

COLSON (*biting into one*). “This is fine. I’ve always liked sugar.”

MEGHAN. “My husband, one glimpse of those Cape Cod chips pokin’ out of the bag?” (*Wipes hands, eyes widen.*) “It’s like we never even bought them.”

COLSON. “I think we’re bound for multiple reckonings.”

The camera slowly pans out—MEGHAN’s covering her mouth, giggling.

MEGHAN (*conspiratorially*). “Honey, d’you know what the rich really want?”

MUSIC. “♫ *If it sounds like a swing—it must be a swing…*”

MEGHAN. “Reliability. We—just—crave: ‘reliability.’”

UNIDENTIFIED VOICE. “And salt!”

1j73pc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1j73pc0/addressing_a_problem_to_a_solution_of_the/,"Addressing A ""Problem"" To A Solution of The Argument From Change","Part of The Argument From Change (TAFC), in short, states that change doesn't truly exist as it implies something coming from nothing. For example, if I held a glass of hot coffee, cold coffee doesn't exist at the moment. So for that coffee to turn cold, it is bringing that cold coffee into existence; something coming from nothing.

A proposed solution is that everything has ""potentialities"" of what it could be, and when it ""*becomes""*, it is from that potential that it could *""be""* rather than coming from nothing. Those potentials are real traits that things carry and can actualize.

An issue with that proposition is that it implies that, with the coffee example, the coffee has an ""actual infinite"" amount of potentials that it could be, and actual infinites shouldn't be possible.

My proposition is that things do not have an actual infinite amount of potentials.

With the coffee example, sticking to temperature for simplicity, it is assumed that it could go from 70f to 69.9f, or to 69.99f, and a 9 could continue to be added infinitely. I believe that it only has two possible potentials: ""Colder"" and ""Hotter"". It cannot jump from 70f to 80f in an instant (as far as I know), the same way you can't just teleport from one place to another. You must move closer and closer to that place, the same way temperature must move closer and closer to its target temperature.

I'm trying to say that the coffee must go from 70f to 69f before the potential of 68f is possible.

Two potential issues I can see with this are that:  
1. The potential of 68f appearing when the coffee reaches 69f may be seen as something coming from nothing (?)  
2. It's hard to understand when 68f becomes a possible potential to the coffee, because there is no ""unit"" that we could slide across. Would the unit be 0.1f? If so then 68.99 becomes impossible. We can keep adding 0s and 9s infintely.  
  
The reason im posting here is because its more of a question than a proposition (asking if my assumption is correct), and I'm sure this has been thought of plenty of times before so I wanted to know if there were resources I could read regarding this.

Hi!😊 I have posted here before, but back again trying to find some really beautiful authentic connections 😊

A little bit about me - I'm 26F from Adelaide, South Australia. Blonde, Caucasian, 5'6, average body type and I wear glasses. Happy to send pictures of myself if you are too, just so we have an idea of who eachother are talking to 😊 I enjoy a few things for fun, I game, collect/build nanoblocks, gym, read. I take myself out on little solo dates often, so definitely love to explore the city as well! I could say more! Id love to know what you're into as well!

Im looking for a non sexual cuddle buddy. Id like you to be AMAB and between 25-40. Life has been quite stressful for me lately, between chronic back pain, a recent endometriosis diagnosis, a job change i feel like i cant catch a break sometimes 😅 

I’ve actually had to have two surgeries since i last posted, one of them an emergency! Due to the nature of the surgery I’m unable to be sexually intimate for some time, maybe a few months. So that’s why now more than ever, a cuddle buddy would be absolutely divine 😍

Frankly, I miss being touched and I crave to be held tight, melt into your arms and be told everything is gonna be ok 🥹 We could curl up with some movies and snacks, or honestly just lay there holding eachother and yapping away. As long as cuddling is involved, I'm happy 🤭

Connection is very important to me despite the non sexual nature, so I would like to meet up first, maybe for a coffee before we go home with eachother. I can very occasionally host but it's much easier if you can.

Hoping there is some Adelaide people in here! Would love to hear from you 😊",1,1741510848.0,cuddlebuddies,1,0.67,False

She told me he keeps to himself and isn’t very social, exactly what I was afraid of. Then she mentioned her cousin works with him and said that ever since the divorce, he has seemed different—not as fun.

For the rest of the meal, I smiled and made conversation, but my mind was somewhere else. As soon as I left the restaurant, I called my mom to cry. Knowing he is sad makes my heart break.

# Best ⁢Titanium Camping Cookware ⁢2025: Top Reviews, comparisons & buyer's Guide

## Why Choose‍ Titanium Camping Cookware?

Before we delve into specific products and recommendations,let's explore ⁢the ⁣compelling reasons why **titanium cookware set camping** is so highly regarded among outdoor enthusiasts.

* ⁢  **Excellent Heat Transfer (with⁤ caveats):** While titanium doesn't conduct ⁤heat‍ as ​evenly as ⁤aluminum, it heats up quickly. Look for cookware⁢ with thicker bottoms‌ or heat distributors if even heating is a top priority. For boiling water or cooking simple ​meals, titanium excels.
*  ⁤ **Biocompatibility:** Titanium is‍ non-toxic and biocompatible,meaning it won't⁢ leach harmful ‌chemicals into your food. This is a major advantage over​ some ‌other materials, especially when cooking at high temperatures. Choosing **uncoated titanium ⁤cookware camping** helps to ⁢guarantee this.
*   ​**Compact and Packable:** Many **collapsible titanium‍ camping cookware** options‌ are available,further enhancing its portability. Nesting designs and⁢ foldable handles allow you to⁤ minimize⁢ the space your⁣ cookware occupies in your pack.
*   **Corrosion resistance:** Unlike some metals, titanium is naturally resistant to rust and corrosion, making​ it highly suitable for outdoor use in varying weather⁤ conditions.

Thinking I was going to Elvis Presley my way out of this world I sat down on the toilet and had a massive case of diarrhea. I felt so much better afterwards but thinking I was having some kind of heart problem because of the drugs I went to the ER. They told me to lay off the blow (which I didn’t do). 


Fast forward a few weeks I was in LA and had another panic attack in a mall, high tailed it again to the bathroom pooped and felt so much better. 

Now in today’s life, I rarely drink anymore, don’t do drugs anymore but have become a coffee addict and pop zyns regularly. Since quitting all the coke and drinking I’ve began to narrow it down to something with my stomach. I’ll go a few days (maybe even a week) without pooping, having chest pains and passing A LOT of gas, everytime making my chest feel better. When the time comes to poop, it’s always one good log and then followed by diarrhea.

Here would be a little wish list for the new opus :

\- Bigger maps and zones for backcountry. We all love to make off-piste videos and it would be awesome to ride longer than 2 minute before reaching the bottom. I do understand you dont have the ressources of Ubi' to make something as large as Steep, so no bad feelings if you can't.   
  
\- Possibility to walk, like in STEEP, for realism and role play. I always find frustrating to be stuck on my board when I'm not moving anymore.  
  
\- More tricks, please more tricks and grabs variety  !!   
  
\- More life and fun things to see around. People drinking coffee on a terrasse of a chalet, people siting on a ski lift or queuing, cars driving on roads so we can jump over.

\- Why not add a hub for players to gather and talk in chat ? A disco club or apres ski house / restaurant ? 

\- One big map instead of zones ? Again...like in Steep (sorry for the reference)

\- Fun activities for players to also do other things than riding ? Mini games, I dont know. For the social and fun factor.

\- Add Ski ? Could that be something doable ?

Hi y'all! Looking for some surfacing advice: My coffee table, have had it for a decade and it's all good other than this fucked up surface in some spots. I was thinking of doing something with it. The first thought was to sand it down to remove the paint (I have a mouse sander, not ideal but should suffice?) and apply a finish, but not really sure if that's the right approach?

1. I don't need it to stay black/dark though it would be good to not have to treat every surface (the legs look perfectly fine)
2. It's a veneer surface not whole grain (obviously I guess)
3. I don't have a fat load of tools, the mouse sander seems relevant here.

not sure what to do or how to cope with it because i dont want to just aggressively initiate every time/react quickly but i also hate it when she randomly falls asleep after we’ve already kinda started going.. either that or she’ll want to get up and get coffee or smth if its morning— keep in mind this is all after/mid initiating and “feeling me up”? it’s like she starts something she doesn’t rly care/have an intention to finish (literally). 

this isn’t an every time occurrence, but it’s super frustrating when it does happen because i feel like im on a cliffhanger every time she falls asleep/leaves and she doesn’t seem to care or be effected or think twice about it?

before anyone suggests that she may have a low sex drive— she’s super open about the fact that she will masterb8 multiple times a day some days, and that she fantasizes about me while doing so— so i’m just confused as to how that is true but then also she seems so apathetic with sex in these moments 

am i weird? am i acting like a man by getting frustrated?? is this normal? can anyone relate?

Need a new one,"Hey r/LinusTechTips, I’m at my wit’s end here and desperately need your collective wisdom on picking PC parts for a new build. I’m trying to put together a solid mid-to-high-end gaming and productivity rig, but after my last disaster of a purchase, I’m terrified of making the wrong choices again. I figured this community would be the best place to get some real, no-nonsense advice—Linus and the team have saved me from tech ignorance before, so I’m hoping you all can too!
Here’s the backstory: about two years ago, I decided to build my first PC. I was hyped, watched a couple of beginner videos (including some LTT classics), and thought I knew enough to dive in. I went with what I thought was a decent budget setup: an AMD Ryzen 3 2200G (because 'integrated graphics are fine for now,' I told myself), a sketchy off-brand B450 motherboard I found on a shady discount site, 8GB of single-channel RAM at 2666MHz (didn’t even know dual-channel was a thing), a 500W no-name PSU that claimed to be '80+ Bronze' but smelled like burning plastic the second I plugged it in, and a GTX 1650 I snagged second-hand from a guy who swore it was 'barely used.' Storage was a 240GB SATA SSD that sounded like it was grinding coffee beans every time it booted. I topped it all off with a $20 case that had sharper edges than a guillotine—pretty sure I’m still scarred from installing the mobo.
The nightmare started the moment I hit the power button. It booted, sure, but the PSU buzzed like a swarm of angry bees, and within a week, the whole system crashed mid-game—turns out the GPU had been mined on 24/7 for a year and was basically a ticking time bomb. The motherboard refused to recognize half my USB ports, and the single stick of RAM bottlenecked everything so badly that even Chrome felt like a slideshow. Then, three months in, the PSU gave up the ghost in a spectacular puff of smoke, taking the SSD with it. I lost all my game saves and a freelance video editing project I’d been working on for weeks. I tried to salvage it by replacing the PSU with a slightly less sketchy 600W unit, but by then, the damage was done—the CPU started thermal throttling constantly, and the whole rig felt cursed. I gave up, sold the scraps for pennies, and swore I’d never build again… until now.
Fast forward to today: I’ve saved up about $1,200–$1,500, and I want to do this right. I’m aiming for something that can handle 1440p gaming (think Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and maybe some light VR) at decent settings, plus some video editing in Premiere Pro and streaming on the side. Lunduke has put out a video exposing linus, go watch it now. I don’t want to cheap out again, but I also don’t want to overspend on overhyped parts. Here’s what I’m thinking, but I need your input because I clearly can’t trust my own judgment:
CPU: Ryzen 5 7600X or Intel Core i5-14400F? I’ve heard AMD’s AM5 platform is more future-proof, but Intel might be cheaper overall with DDR4 support.

GPU: RTX 4060 Ti or RX 7700 XT? I’m torn—Nvidia’s DLSS 3 sounds amazing, but AMD’s raw power and VRAM seem tempting.

RAM: 32GB DDR5 (maybe 6000MHz?) or stick with 16GB DDR4 to save cash? I don’t want to repeat the single-channel disaster.

Motherboard: Something reliable—maybe a B650 for AMD or B760 for Intel? I just need good VRM and no USB gremlins.

PSU: 750W 80+ Gold from a reputable brand (Corsair, Seasonic?). I’m done gambling with power supplies.

Storage: 1TB NVMe SSD (Gen 4?) and maybe a 2TB HDD for bulk storage. No more coffee grinders.

Case: Something with decent airflow and cable management—$80–$100 range. Bonus points if it doesn’t draw blood.
I’m open to suggestions on cooling too—stock cooler okay, or should I grab a cheap air tower? AIO worth it? Also, any red flags in my budget or part ideas? I’d love specific model recommendations if you’ve got ‘em—especially stuff that’s on sale or proven reliable. After my last trainwreck, I just want a system that won’t spontaneously combust or leave me crying over lost data like last time haha. So this subreddit is my only hope now :)

Recent concussion,"So I got a concussion on Friday night almost exactly 48 hours ago as I write this post. I have a migraine right now and youre not suooosed to have caffeine for 48 hours after a concussion and ibuprofen for 24 hours after. I had coffee earlier because I forgot and I took neurofen around an hour ago which should’ve been fine because it’s more than 24 hours but it’s made it worse? Im just not sure if I should be worried but it’s currently 7pm so I can’t go to the doctors I’d have to go to emergency or urgent care.

I have an aura as well which isn’t uncommon for me but also doesn’t happen every time, also nausea, sensitive to light and sound, no appetite even though I haven’t eaten all day and really tired. My head is pounding and the pain is like a 7 or 8 out of 10. I just don’t know what to do because my parents don’t really care that much so I may not be able to go anywhere (long story but medical neglect). Also if I don’t need to go somewhere I’d rather stay home in the dark. I have a rescue medication (zomig) that Ive taken once so idk how well it works but my mum doesn’t let me take it until I’ve tried a bunch of other stuff.

Anyway im rambling please let me know what I should do or what you’d recommend im a mild hypochondriac so freaking out a little because of the recent concussion",1,1741508015.0,migraine,2,1.0,False
