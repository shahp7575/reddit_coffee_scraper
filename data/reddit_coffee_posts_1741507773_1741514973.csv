1j74j8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1j74j8x/a_happy_story_how_i_got_cured/,"A happy story, how I got cured","It all started after one weird meal in a foreign country. Acid reflux (which I‚Äôve never had until then), gastric pains (had as a kid), burping non-stop, bloating. I ate relatively healthy before (no fast carbs or ultra-processed foods), hadn‚Äôt smoked or drank alcohol. After that meal, I couldn‚Äôt drink coffee, couldn‚Äôt eat almost anything, including greens that were the main part of my diet.
I went straight to a GP, was tested for pylori (negative), was prescribed Omeprazole, and told that I probably have a hernia. Further tests were unavailable at this early stage in the protocol. I managed to get referred to a gall bladder ultrasound, because I used to have sludge.
I refused to take Omeprasole without any conclusive diagnosis and decided to start with whatever other changes I could do.
I had had a chest infection with three courses of antibiotics some half a year before that, so I thought that my digestion was still out of balance due to that. Plus maybe some weird bacteria with that meal in a foreign country.
I used a wedge pillow for sleep.
Took gaviscon before sleep.
I did an elimination diet. Acid watchers diet didn‚Äôt work for me. For about a month I could tolerate only chard, chicken breast, and a millet or oat porridge. 
I also took supplements. I approached the reflux from several angles (anxiety-related, biome-related, immune-system related), so I took these things:
Probiotic (spore probiotics (don't remember the brand), Irwin Naturals cleanse with triphala).
Prebiotic (psyllium).
Aller-pure by Irwin Naturals for possible allergy reactions/immune system overreaction after the infection.
L-Theanine, Magnesium for anxiety.
Calcium 
Mastic gum
Oregano oil capsules (removed the bloating)
Zinc
Marshmallow, aloe, slippery elm complex
DGL
L-Glutamine (this helped me immediately with gastric pains).
Digestive enzymes with bromelain (New brand Super Enzymes).

Things that didn‚Äôt work:
I tried mixing baking soda with hot water and then adding cool water to it and drinking, but it was horror - I must have felt every of my sore spots in the digestive tract as it went down.
Vinegar.
Lemon.

Things were slowly improving and after four months of this regimen (with adding more foods to my diet), I can now eat everything I ate before the fateful meal. I can drink coffee, eat spicy, sour, everything. 
Hope this will help someone, who like me could have something not so serious. 
Btw I had my ultrasound three months after the referral and it went splendidly. I felt almost completely healthy by then anyway.

I've been a longtime fan of our Queen, the one and only Charlotte and I do mean a looong time, all the way back to naked man times.

So I created a reddit account just to share this story.

  
A few preambles before we get to the good stuff.

\- This is not my story, but a good friend who I introduced to Charlotte's youtube channel, had kindly asked me to share it for her.

\- Names have been changed.

Now buckle up buttercups, cause this one's a doozy.

  
Our heroine (22f at the time), let's call her Bailey, met this really cute girl in uni, lets call her Christina (21f) and felt an instant attraction to her. She thought she saw a little spark of interest back but like most lesbians, she gay panicked, it's a thing... so she didn't feel she got enough of a vibe from her, so they just remained friendly.

A few months into their friendship, and Bailey although typically an outgoing and direct person, hand't found a real chance to reveal her interest to Christina as she never really spoke much about anyone she was interested in, hence she didn't know if she was into women or not. She was quiet, shy and never revealed much about her private life. Bailey didn't mind that, as they were just getting to know eachother on a friendly level and some people are like that, they need to get to know someone to really open up. Also Christina never dated in uni, she was more focused on her studies, didn't drink at the parties and was never seen hooking up with anyone.

Their friendship grew and they would meet up with, always with other friends at parties and get togethers once or twice a week and such was their friendship throughout uni. Basically Bailey quietly pining away for Christina but never having the guts to express anything. As I'm sure most of our friendly neighbourhood queer ladies already know, pining is part of package issued with your lesbian card. We sit, staring across the room, sending gay bat signals with our eyeballs hoping the person we're trying to attract will come to us and be all... yes, I am of the queer, lets queer together.

  
Alas, Bailey graduated uni and moved back to her hometown and that effectively ended their friendship as they didn't keep in touch long distance, they were friendly but never got to a best friend status and Bailey had chickend out to ask to keep in touch.

Bailey had always wondered about what if she had been brave enough to say something to Christina and found herself often thinking about her throught the years after uni.

Fast forward 6 years later, Bailey now 30 and her brother, lets call him Tate (28M at the time), who was living in a different city, would return home for Christmas holidays and was bringing his fiance for everyone to finally meet.

Bailey and her brother didn't have a good relationship. He was always exrtemely jealous of her since they were children and him being the baby of the family was very much spoiled. He grew up to become quite the a-hole, often having multiple girlfriends at the same time, very much a red pill, podcast bro type of character and Bailey loathed spending any real time with him as he often made sexists and homophobic ""jokes"" all the time.

Sooo, Christmast time is upon as, and as you guessed it, Christina was by his side as he walked in. Bailey's mouth met the floor and Christina also looked quite taken aback by the reunion.

The two women hugged and laughed at the serendipity of it all, instantly reconnecting all the while Tate was eyeing them suspiciously not looking happy at all.

His first remarks were along the lines of, ""How the hell do you two know each other"" and ""Ease up on the touchy feely there, sis.""

As the day went on Bailey and Christina were glued to each other catching up with everything and of course Bailey was dying to know, how she ended up engaged to her shitty brother of all people but she knew she couldn't force the conversation too much, especially with Tate watching them both like a hawk.

By the end of the night, Bailey had to leave as she had her own place but Christina had asked to meet for coffee somewhere the next day. Tate invited himself along but Christina shot him down, saying she needed some girl time with Bailey to catch up and that he had something organized with his best man anyway so the coffee date was set.

The two women met for coffee and any other free moment they could as Tate was galavanting around town with his boys to have some bro time, so Christina seemed eager to do the same with Bailey and to start opening up to Bailey about how she ended up with Tate. 

To summerize, Christina had met Tate through her brother. She was never much interested in dating but had started feeling the pressure from her family to settle down and Tate seemed driven, and a take charge kind of guy and her brother and mother had really pushed for the two to get together. Tate as well was relentless with her, telling her she would become his wife from their first date, as he really wanted a ""pure"" woman to be his wife. They were together for 8 months before he had popped the question.

Bailey was shocked. She couldn't wrap her head around the idea of sweet, quiet and gentle Christina ending up with her Neanderthal brother. She tried to be happy about it but it just didn't feel right. Although Christina had opened up to her about how she met Tate, Bailey felt there was something Christina wasn't sharing with her. All she could do at this point was try to be there for her and hoped that maybe her brother had changed his ways since he moved away from home and was settling down.

They family would typically get together for dinners and that's when Bailey started noticing how Tate was treating Christina. He was very controlling, talking down on her, ordering her around like ""Babe, you don't see that I finished my beer?""

Bailey was appaled and tried to not react to it as when she did react Tate would become worse with his behaviour towards Christina.

During one of the dinners, when Tate actually put hands on Christina, he had grabbed her wrist very aggressively and was intimidating her, Bailey couldn't help reacting by shoving him back and confronting him about his shitty behaviour.

Shit went down! Tate started screaming at Bailey. ""I know what you're doing, and you better back off my woman!"" while Bailey was in his face screaming ""You sexist peace of shit, don't you put hands on her."" All the while Christina was crying begging them to stop till their parents came to separate them.

Tate demanded that Bailey leave but their parents had put a stop to the fight and calmed everyone down enough. After the dinner, which was awkward and full of snide remarks from Tate, Christina, to everyone's surprise asked to spend some time alone, that she would go to a hotel for that evening as she needed some time away from everything to calm down. Tate of course exploded into a rage again but both her partents for once had coralled him enough agreeing that maybe some time apart would settle things for everyone.

Another big surprise for Bailey came later that night when she received a text message from Christina, asking her to meet up at the hotel, as she needed to talk to her.

They sat at the bar and Christina fully opened up to her, telling her what Bailey had suspected, that Tate was abusive to her and she felt scared and trapped in the relationship. Bailey was furious and also worried for her but the biggest revalation to Bailey that sent her world spirilling into chaos was that one of the reasons she eventually said yes to dating Tate was that he reminded her so much of Bailey. As Bailey is more masculine presenting, she and Tate look quite similar to each other. Although Christina added he never had the kind eyes she always would remember for years after uni.

Bailey almost confessed that she had been very much interested in Christina at uni but she felt that wasn't the right time for that or if that time would ever arrive for them. Her first priority was Christina's well being so she gently navigated the conversation asking her what did she want to do in the end. Would she go ahead with the wedding?

Christina felt trapped and that as her whole family was pushing for the wedding and that if she dared to break the engagement, her parents would lose a lot of money as they were paying for a lot of the wedding venues and vendors and had already put heafty deposits down. Her family was very much money obsessed and she explained if she would break the engagement they would probably demand that she pay them the money back they lost so she resigned herself to marrying Tate and then probably divorcing him a few years later.

Bailey was horrified and vowed that she would try and help her come up with a solution. Christina wasn't convinced easily but after a while she agreed to hear Bailey out and think about things.

Bailey went back home and spent a few days away from Christina and Tate trying to come up with a solution. She had asked Christina to send her all the info on the vendors so she could tally up the whole amount of what she would have to pay.

She then asked Christina to have a phonecall with her family to see if that would even be the case, maybe if she told them the truth about the abuse, they wouldn't expect her to go forward with the wedding. She resisted fearing to confront them but she met Bailey at her house and called them putting them on speaker. To Bailey's horror the were not supportive of her leaving Tate, and her mother specifically blamed Christina, about Tate's behaviour, telling her she wasn't acting well enough to not anger her future husband.

That confrontation only lit a bigger fire under Bailey's ass. She would help this woman get out of this. The amount of money she would need for breaking the contracts with the vendors wasn't insurmountable and Bailey decided to use her savings. She had managed to make quite a heafty nest egg for herself as she was not in a relationship or had any children. She would wait to tell Christina as first she needed Christina to indeed want to end things with Tate.

  I'm a 19 years old woman from Hong Kong (UTC+8). I decided to post this, because:
1) I enjoy writing self intros.
2) I want people to share with me about their passions and creative projects :D


  I'm very curious and will ask a lot of questions (tho what I ask can be quite dumb sometimes).



**A bit of my lore**

- Like everyone else, I'm still figuring out what to do with life. I dropped out of high school due to mental health issues (to the point of wanting to su1c1de. thankfully I was dragged to a doctor some days before I really did it).
- Now I'm planning to complete night school. After getting my high school qualification, I will keep working to save up some money for an alternative path that is not college.



**Personality**
- I'll be honest, I have anger issues and moodswings. I'm still working on them because I don't wanna hurt the others and myself again
- Introverted, raw, honest, very sentimental, open-minded, curious. And I do try to be understanding



**Interests**
- Learning languages, standard German and Brazilian Portuguese
- Sewing countryballs. I also wanna try sewing small plushies after I get better at the basic techniques
- Reading books, something light-hearted, dark, or thought-provoking
- Remembering flags and countries on the world map üòõ
- Swimming. But I haven't swim for about 5 months already, and I suck a lot lol
- Listening to any type of obscure gems of different genres
- Still creating my conlang, only about a dozen words ready :(



**Likes**
- *Raw and honest* people. Someone who knows or really tries to know themselves, and will stay in touch with and be true to thenselves
- Anything that is adorkable ><
- Cats, geckos, moths, rice weevils (yes), dark grey and yellow, coffee with milk (but I don't mind the quality much), small plushies, winter with sunlight, quiet and peace
- I currently listen to: doomy stoner rock (current most-listened-to genre), vintage music box (tho I hope the pitch is much lower), piano pop?, classical music sometimes, also any rock that sounds fun

1j740rf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j740rf/my_dead_brothers_old_friend_is_worrying_me_and_i/,my dead brother‚Äôs old friend is worrying me and i do not know what to do,"When I was 16 (F) (now 23) my brother died in a car accident. It was brutal. He was my only sibling. He was 18 years old. He was popular. He had a girlfriend and a large group of friends, most of which were from the same group- they were tight knit.
My brother was a kind person, and had also manage to find friends in other walks of life, some of which he met in detention at school, some of which had no friends of their own- they were not apart of his ‚Äúpopular‚Äù group at school, so he hung out with them separately- for drinks, or lunch, or coffee- outside of school hours.
(Btw I am so sorry if there‚Äôs any spelling or grammatical errors, i used voice to text to write this out as I couldn‚Äôt really find the words when typing).
This year in November, it will be eight years since he passed. Recently, one of his ‚Äúother‚Äù  friends has started to display some concerning behaviours.  
Although it has been eight years, those to have lost a sibling or a child know the pain that my family feels. Some days we get on okay. Other days it feels like at the moment we found out he was gone all over again. 
To sum up, this person wasn‚Äôt close with my brother. He is a sweet boy who took classes with my brother, texted my brother, maybe even caught up with him once or twice. But I feel horrible in saying- he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúknown‚Äù as a friend of his to my family or myself until after his passing. But for the past year, or so, he has sent me concerning messages. Messages on how he ‚Äúsees my brother infront of him‚Äù and how he wants to see me in person for coffee or dinner to tell me the things my brother has told him in spirit. 
After my brother‚Äôs passing my family and I saw ladybirds as a symbol of him being around us. This person has now had a large ladybird tattooed on his arm. It sounds horrible without context, but he has been calling me and messaging me at all hours of the night, even at 2 am when my partner and I are sleep in our bed, asking if I have time for a phone call to talk about what my brother has been telling him. 
This makes me uncomfortable. But I must say I am not the kind of person to turn-away someone who I personally see, as in need of psychological help. It sounds wrong to say. I appreciate him thinking of my brother in this way- even going as far to get a tattoo in honour of him, but coming from someone who barely knew him, this is concerning. 
He has found my parents on Facebook- also messaging them asking to catch up for coffee or drink to ‚Äútalk‚Äù.  Although my parents are adults and can make their own decisions, I feel protective- I don‚Äôt want them to sit down and listen to what I personally see as spiritual delusions. They are empathetic people, and I know this would upset them deeply, not due to my brother‚Äôs death, but due to a smart young man rambling on about his psychic abilities to see my brother talking to him. They care a lot for all people who knew him, who he loved- so to see one of them in this state would be confronting to them.
I am not a skeptic when it comes to the spiritual world, but if you knew all of the messages this person has sent me, you would see how I see it- he is not well, he does not sleep. He posts on social media about ladybirds and seeing my brother in them, constantly. He now has people who didn‚Äôt know my brother whatsoever sending him photos of ladybirds. He tells them *insert my brother‚Äôs name* is with them- people who didn‚Äôt know him whatsoever, he screenshots it and puts it on his story. He is making some kind of spiritual icon out of my brother and it makes me uncomfortable and upset.
I know, I need to tell him how I feel, how I feel his, turning my brother into some kind of martyr that he wasn‚Äôt, perhaps some of you will read this, and think that I should feel honoured or happy that someone is carrying on his legacy. But I am not comfortable with the fact that there are people out there, who didn‚Äôt know him who do not know us now see ladybirds and send them to this person and say that he‚Äôs with them when this person himself didn‚Äôt even know him well at all‚Ä¶ A month ago, I found this person‚Äôs sister on Facebook and messaged her with my concerns for his mental health and obsession over my deceased brother. She was so empathetic and lovely and assured me that they were well aware of his situation as a family. I asked that my message to her remain anonymous as I would hate for him to think that I was ‚Äúsnitching‚Äù on him for something he clearly cannot help mentally- but the phone calls and messages have only persisted since.
I care for this boy, and I cannot help that- I care for him in the way I care for all the people who knew my beautiful brother. Due to my grief, I feel I cannot block him and I‚Äôll wait to see his name on the news or in an article saying he took his life or something of the sort. But I cannot continue to play into this delusion, or tell him that we will catch up soon even though I truly do not want to, as I know what he will try to tell me will upset me. Any advice on what to tell him in a kind, caring way would be so appreciated.. i am at a loss currently.",1,1741512405.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

This is an RP based on the new film Mickey 17. The basic premise is this:

In a future where humanity has expanded into the stars, interstellar colonization is a brutal and unforgiving endeavor. The wealthiest corporations spearhead these ventures, using advanced cloning technology to create Expendables‚Äîworkers who take on the riskiest, deadliest tasks with the promise of resurrection via cloning whenever they die. These Expendables are not considered people in the traditional sense, just replaceable assets, printed and discarded as needed.

Alex Kane is one such Expendable. With no ties left on Earth‚Äîhis family fractured or gone, his purpose uncertain‚Äîhe signs on for a deep-space mission to a distant colony. He‚Äôs not excited about the job, exactly, but he figures it doesn‚Äôt matter. If he dies, they‚Äôll print a new him, and if he keeps going long enough, maybe he‚Äôll stop caring about which version of him is real.

As the crew prepares to leave Earth for good, Alex meets (Y/C), another member of the expedition. Unlike him, she seems steady, experienced‚Äîsomeone who belongs in space, while he‚Äôs just figuring it out. Maybe she‚Äôs an engineer, a scientist, a soldier, or something else entirely, but she doesn‚Äôt seem fazed by what he is. She sees him in a way most people don‚Äôt, and that unsettles him more than he wants to admit.

The launchpad was alive with activity‚Äîvoices overlapping in hurried commands, the whir of machinery, the occasional burst of steam hissing from the shuttle‚Äôs underbelly. This was the last stop. The final stretch before Alex Kane left Earth behind for good.

And somehow, he didn‚Äôt feel much of anything.

No fear, no excitement. Just a quiet, dull acceptance.

He shifted his duffel higher on his shoulder, watching as the crew made their final checks. The ship towered over him, sleek and sterile, its hull reflecting the last fading light of day. This was it. The last sky he‚Äôd ever see.

Not that there was much waiting for him here.

Earth had stopped feeling like home a long time ago.

He had no one left. No real ties. His family had fractured long before they ever had the chance to be whole. His parents‚Äîgone. His brother? He hadn‚Äôt spoken to him in years. They were strangers now, bound only by shared blood and old wounds neither of them had bothered to mend.

So when the contract came through‚Äîwhen he saw the job listing for Expendable‚Äîit had been an easy choice. A guaranteed out. No messy goodbyes, no funeral needed if something went wrong. Just a seamless transition from one body to the next, like hitting reset on a faulty machine.

Maybe that was the real draw. He didn‚Äôt have to worry about what came next. Didn‚Äôt have to be him anymore. Just a fresh copy, over and over, until eventually, it didn‚Äôt matter which version was real.

The thought made his chest tighten, so he shoved it down, burying it beneath the usual bravado.

That‚Äôs when he saw her. (Y/C).

She was leaning against a supply crate, coffee in hand‚Äîwhere did she even get coffee out here?‚Äîwatching the chaos unfold with a steady, practiced ease. She didn‚Äôt look nervous, didn‚Äôt look excited either. Just‚Ä¶ grounded. Like she belonged.

Unlike him.

Alex took a breath and walked over, stopping just close enough to be casual but not weird. First impressions mattered, right? He should say something cool, something confident.

Instead, what came out was:

‚ÄúSo, uh‚Ä¶ this your first time dying, or just another Tuesday?‚Äù

He immediately regretted it.

(Y/C) turned her head slightly, raising an eyebrow. A beat of silence stretched between them before she took a slow sip of her coffee, then finally responded.

‚ÄúBold opener.‚Äù

Alex forced a grin, shifting his bag. ‚ÄúYeah, figured why waste time with small talk? We‚Äôre about to spend a few years stuck in a metal can together. Might as well cut to the existential dread.‚Äù

She studied him for a moment, her gaze sharp‚Äîassessing. Like she was peeling back layers without even trying. It made him want to fidget, but he held his ground.

Then, to his relief, she smirked. ‚ÄúGuess that depends on how expendable you are.‚Äù

Alex let out a breathy chuckle, rubbing the back of his neck. ‚ÄúYeah, about that‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm one of them.‚Äù He gestured vaguely toward the Expendables checking in. ‚ÄúFreshly printed, shiny and new. Though, technically, still me.‚Äù

(Y/C) didn‚Äôt look surprised. ‚ÄúMakes sense.‚Äù

He blinked. ‚ÄúWait, really? No weird reaction? No ‚Äòoh wow, you‚Äôre okay with being cloned like an office printer jam?‚Äô‚Äù

She shrugged. ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs got a job. Yours just happens to come with a backup plan.‚Äù

Alex studied her for a second, then huffed a quiet laugh. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ surprisingly practical. You always this chill?‚Äù

(Y/C) smirked, taking another sip. ‚ÄúGuess you‚Äôll find out.‚Äù

Before he could respond, the intercom crackled overhead, calling for final boarding. The last stragglers started moving toward the shuttle, their voices fading into the hum of the engines warming up.

Alex exhaled, glancing up at the sky one last time.

No turning back.

His grip tightened on his bag as he looked at (Y/C) again. ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs your deal? Veteran spacer? Engineer? Mysterious woman who knows more than she lets on?‚Äù

(Y/C) glanced toward the shuttle, then back at him, eyes glinting with something unreadable. ‚ÄúMaybe a little of everything.‚Äù

Alex grinned. ‚ÄúGreat. I love a good mystery.‚Äù

In a future where humanity has expanded into the stars, interstellar colonization is a brutal and unforgiving endeavor. The wealthiest corporations spearhead these ventures, using advanced cloning technology to create Expendables‚Äîworkers who take on the riskiest, deadliest tasks with the promise of resurrection via cloning whenever they die. These Expendables are not considered people in the traditional sense, just replaceable assets, printed and discarded as needed.

Alex Kane is one such Expendable. With no ties left on Earth‚Äîhis family fractured or gone, his purpose uncertain‚Äîhe signs on for a deep-space mission to a distant colony. He‚Äôs not excited about the job, exactly, but he figures it doesn‚Äôt matter. If he dies, they‚Äôll print a new him, and if he keeps going long enough, maybe he‚Äôll stop caring about which version of him is real.

As the crew prepares to leave Earth for good, Alex meets (Y/C), another member of the expedition. Unlike him, she seems steady, experienced‚Äîsomeone who belongs in space, while he‚Äôs just figuring it out. Maybe she‚Äôs an engineer, a scientist, a soldier, or something else entirely, but she doesn‚Äôt seem fazed by what he is. She sees him in a way most people don‚Äôt, and that unsettles him more than he wants to admit.

You have to imagine I'm standing at one of the several hotel bars where you can order a snack. I stand in the queue and tell my husband to find a seat nearby. When it's my turn, I order two sandwiches for us, which are ready to go in the display case, and a coffee. 

The waiter behind the counter was alone, so he gives me my sandwiches and presses the button on the coffee machine and tells me I can pick up my cappuccino in a minute. I take the plates, walk a few steps to the table where my husband is sitting and put the sandwiches down. To pick up my cappuccino, I turn around and stand at the side of the counter (to the left of the queue) to wait a little longer until the coffee is ready. 

Suddenly a woman from the right shouted at me, asking what kind of person I was for daring to jump the queue with a child. I was so perplexed that I didn't understand what she wanted. I didn't say anything for a second, which could have made it look like I wanted to order something else. So I have no idea how she even got the idea. Only then did I see that there was a little boy in front on the right who seemed to want to order something.

Out of reflex that she was shouting at me, I told her in a very loud voice that I already ordered, had put my sandwiches on the table and was just waiting for my cappuccino (which she should have seen if she had been standing behind me in the queue...). So she should please not shout at me like that...

Funny, suddenly no more sound came out of her mouth. No apologies, nothing. The waiter gives me my cappuccino, I thank him and turn around to go back to my table. Then suddenly other guests start making stupid comments about the bad mood on vacation... and I just think to myself, yes, ask that unrelaxed, stupid mother, not me! 

Thank God, it was shortly before departure and for me it's now clear: next vacation I will only stay at a adult only hotel! 

Nonetheless, I really wonder what is wrong with humanity, especially frustrated mothers, that they freak out for no reason in an all-inclusive hotel where there is food and drink on  literally every corner.

Imagine if times were to change... would they then become completely furious? üôÑ

Wanted to share thats all!,"There‚Äôs a mini snack centre below my apartment. I go there every Sunday for my breakfast. It always smells of fresh vegetables, hot tea and chatter. 

I noticed one such summer. At exactly 8 AM, a pretty lady comes there. She orders exactly one plate of idli, no chutney, and a cup of filtered coffee‚Äîsometimes a parcel, sometimes to eat. I don‚Äôt like idli; it tastes dry and spongey to my palette. 

I always wanted to confront her about the odd but straight pattern, maybe even get her number. 

But I never could. Sometimes I came late, or she came earlier. But on the times when we ordered at same time, I couldn‚Äôt muster my courage. I always told myself ‚Äúnext weekend‚Äù.

 A dozen such weekends passed. I tried all sorts of combinations‚Äîeverything but idli. Never the idli.

Then came the winters. She stopped visiting. 
A few months passed. I kept going there routinely, exactly at 8 AM. But she didn‚Äôt. And one fine spring day, she came. Something had changed; her hair was different. A ring had popped on her finger, and her order had changed. It is now two plates of idli and two cups of coffee. In fact, she orders something new every Sunday. And I just sit there, amusing myself with a plate of Idli and coffee. I suppose the dryness of idli and the spices of sambhar play well.

MEGHAN (*frying bacon*). ‚ÄúYou know that feeling; when you don‚Äôt know why but you just have a pit in your stomach, and it follows you around?‚Äù

In a Jackie O. dress, white, sleeveless, with a J. Crew striped white-and-beige cardigan wrapped around her shoulders, MEGHAN tosses chicken wings into a pan. The kitchen has a natural island backdropped by windows with a view of an atmospheric garden. The floor is black polished hardwood. There‚Äôs enough space between the island and the stovetop to dance in.

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúBacon and eggs‚Äîthat‚Äôs Colson‚Äôs thing. He‚Äôs all ‚Äòclassic Americana.‚Äô‚Äù

MICHAEL (*off-camera*). ‚ÄúAre you, are you nervous about‚Ä¶‚Äù

The camera pans across a clean, well-maintained Montecito kitchen.

MEGHAN (*to herself*). ‚ÄúIf he wants to say I ‚Äòsmile‚Äô too much, you can tell him it‚Äôs called having ‚Äòmanners‚Äô? We‚Äôre not here, right, just to smear our doom and gloom over everyone‚Äôs spreads like we can‚Äôt have nice bagels? We‚Äôre here to be ‚Äòcivil,‚Äô do things by the book; rules exist for a reason.‚Äù

\[CUT TO: A sprinkle of salt into the pan.\]

MEGHAN (*raising a cup of espresso*). ‚ÄúCheers.‚Äù

Smiling, MEGHAN knocks back a cup of brew with MICHAEL, who‚Äôs barely in the shot. As she sips, MEGHAN glances sideways with an ironic smile.

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúYou know our beans, were extracted, by people we know?‚Äù

MICHAEL. ‚ÄúGet out of here!‚Äù

MEGHAN (*sipping from her cup*). ‚ÄúSo one thing you‚Äôll notice is‚Äîwhen I was growing up? We respected royalty; we respected dignity, refinement, elegance, and manners. That‚Äôs, you know‚Äîyou just have to ‚Äòsee where the eyeballs are‚Äô? That‚Äôs‚Äîwisdom from the ancient moms: ‚ÄòThe have-nots, as it turns out, aspired mainly to having.‚Äô So, it‚Äôs not about‚Äî‚Äòenvy,‚Äô right?‚Äù

MICHAEL. ‚ÄúYou know, on Saturdays; we can think about that kind of stuff.‚Äù

COLSON (*humble nod*). ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúWell, have a seat anywhere!‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúOnce or twice in my life.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúSo I have a gift for you.‚Äù

\[CUT TO: A really well-done gift set is presented. Next to the kitchen island, COLSON‚Äôs twirling on a stool; MEGHAN‚Äôs behind a stove.\]

COLSON (*receiving it*). ‚ÄúOh wow, thanks.‚Äù

MEGHAN (*making direct eye contact*). ‚ÄúI know you like ‚Äòhonesty,‚Äô so I got you Honesty Bath Bombs; because you‚Äôre always in the bathtub!‚Äù

COLSON (*to himself*). ‚ÄúI‚Äôll actually use these.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that great?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even mention it!‚Äù

COLSON (*still giddy*). ‚ÄúSo I don‚Äôt know, what I could say, led there like a horse to water, that couldn‚Äôt be presented later without context, so I just want to YELL THAT UPFRONT.‚Äù

MEGHAN turns from the stove and laughs.

COLSON (*charismatically*). ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs MUST-SEE TV.‚Äù

\[CUT TO: The crew applauds.\]

MEGHAN (*still laughing*). ‚ÄúSo I think it‚Äôs great how you‚Äôre always talking about‚Äîhow you think things are? I think it‚Äôs just really important to clarify at the outset: I‚Äôm not the first rich person you ever met.‚Äù

COLSON shakes his head.

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúAnd do you feel sort of like a‚Äî‚Äòfish out of water‚Äô?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúWell, yeah.‚Äù

MEGHAN (*frowning, pointing in circles*). ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in one fish bowl, honey.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really like, hierarchal‚Äî‚Äù

MEGHAN (*stares*). ‚ÄúI mean, what do think this is?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúUm.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúYour first job was Jamba Juice; wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúSo if we had worked together at Jamba Juice; you wouldn‚Äôt be happy for me?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúI mean‚ÄîI‚Äôd be fine.‚Äù

\[CUT TO: A close-up of Thai chili chicken wings, bacon, and eggs in a pan.\]

MEGHAN (*turns around*). ‚ÄúWant some water? Oops; I already know you said no‚ÄîI‚Äôm so sorry, I can‚Äôt help it!‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just; whenever I see someone who doesn‚Äôt have a refreshment‚Äîmy mind goes haywire.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúWhat, are you doing?‚Äù

MEGHAN (*turns around, holding up a jar*). ‚ÄúOh; they‚Äôre flower sprinkles! Have you ever put them on chicken wings before?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúNo, never.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúWhat!‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

MEGHAN (*walking over to Colson*). ‚ÄúIf you had kids, you‚Äôd get it!‚Äù

Leaning over the kitchen island, MEGHAN‚Äôs now holding a spoonful of flower sprinkles directly in front of COLSON‚Äôs mouth.

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúHere, you have to try this.‚Äù

COLSON (*after a pause*). ‚ÄúUm; okay?‚Äù

In one swift motion, COLSON gobbles up the flower sprinkles from MEGHAN‚Äôs spoon.

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN‚Äôs eyes widen as she smiles.\]

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that incredible!‚Äù

\[CUT TO: Olive oil streaming into a pan from the metal nub of a glass container.\]

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúA lot of how I approach, ‚Äòdecadence,‚Äô right, is I compare it to ‚Äòusing olive oil when you‚Äôre not supposed to‚Äô?‚Äù (*Laughs.*) ‚ÄúI know it sounds ‚Äòcrazy,‚Äô but I found that with so many recipes that always ‚Äòsound so high-end on a menu,‚Äô they can actually be replicated, at home‚Äîmuch more affordably, mind you‚Äîwith just a little splash of olive oil! Right? I call it ‚Äòthat surprise splash of olive oil‚Äô? And so‚Äîif I‚Äôm picking out an outfit or I‚Äôm hired to do a floral arrangement for my kids, and I‚Äôm debating whether or not I really need that ‚Äòone last accessory‚Äô? Right, I ask myself: is this like ‚Äòsplashing olive oil into Sabra to elevate game night‚Äô; or is it, even one step beyond that?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúRight. I mean, this house.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúOh, Montecito was inspired by the Olive Garden‚Äîolive gardens; Italy‚Äî‚Äù \[*closes eyes*\] ‚Äú‚Äîso you can actually‚Äîinstead of vacations, I just walk outside. All the time.‚Äù

Her eyes fume.

COLSON. ‚ÄúRight. And did you‚Äîdid you find yourself, having to splash ‚Äòolive oil,‚Äô onto an inferior situation to‚Äî‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúOh, to get this house? This house was like 5,000% olive oil.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúYeah, but we‚Äîdo you not understand yet that if we didn‚Äôt live here, an oligarch would?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI‚Äôm not from your world.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúThis house‚Äîis‚Äîlike a medina in an ancient tranquility.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúI mean they all are; on cooking shows.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúAnd I just thought, you know; if you can come from out of nowhere like I did, and have something nice‚ÄîI mean, isn‚Äôt that just all of us?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I really didn‚Äôt think about it that much.‚Äù

\[CUT TO: An egg timer goes off.\]

MEGHAN (*breaks out into laughter*). ‚ÄúOh my gosh‚Äîthe chicken‚Äôs ready!‚Äù

\[CUT TO: Two plates of chili-speckled chicken wings.\]

COLSON (*taking a bite*). ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs, yeah.‚Äù

MEGHAN (*smiling intensely while making eye contact*). ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it good?‚Äù

COLSON (*putting a napkin to lips*). ‚ÄúYeah, really good.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve already been on my podcast.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúAnd now you‚Äôre doin‚Äô my lifestyle show.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúBut only in your head.‚Äù

COLSON (*puts down the napkin*). ‚ÄúCorrect.‚Äù

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN pops open a champagne bottle.\]

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúSo last night I couldn‚Äôt sleep, so I went on a juice-squeezing frenzy. See that jar of pineapple juice over there?‚Äù (*Points to the kitchen island, while walking to the refrigerator.*) ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just the beginning.‚Äù

MEGHAN opens up the fridge.

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúI literally have twenty centuries‚Äô worth of pineapple juice.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúWhoa.‚Äù

MEGHAN shuts the fridge.

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre like a normal family, right? ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt believe everything you see on HBO.‚Äô Colson; I have something else for you. Are you ready?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúReady.‚Äù

MEGHAN (*spins around, holding a jar*). ‚ÄúI made some preserves for you!‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù

MEGHAN (*laughing*). ‚ÄúAnd look, the lids‚ÄîI painted them like little lifesavers.‚Äù

COLSON (*after a pause*). ‚ÄúOh! Because I like the¬†*Titani*c.‚Äù

\[CUT TO: A how-to segment‚Äôs title screen slides in: ‚Äú*How to Be Considerate*.‚Äù\]

MEGHAN (*to someone off-camera*). ‚ÄúSo a lot of things go into the concept of ‚Äòtact,‚Äô right‚ÄîI feel like, you know, if I‚Äôm actually a thoughtful person, it‚Äôs sort of my responsibility to make sure everyone‚Äôs having a good time, right?‚Äù

\[CUT TO: A montage of B-rolls‚Äîpastel cakes, Thai chili flakes.\]

MEGHAN (*to someone off-camera*). ‚ÄúSo many people, I think, have an idea of what rich people enjoy? And now that I‚Äôve seen it for myself, I can tell you‚Äîwe enjoy it when everybody shares our values. It‚Äôs kind of like‚Äîit‚Äôs kind of like¬†*The Godfather*, right? You want to make sure nobody‚Äôs rockin‚Äô the boat‚Äîso that‚Äôs where ‚Äòtact‚Äô comes in, it¬†*separates*, it¬†*sieves*, the ones who have tact, from, you know, those without. And at the end of the day; if you‚Äôre in God‚Äôs castle? You have to play by God‚Äôs rules of the game‚Äîand that‚Äôs sharing our values, about how to behave. And that‚Äôs being considerate.‚Äù

Doo-wop transition.

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN and COLSON conversing in the Montecito kitchen.\]

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúSo; right? I‚Äôm just showing you‚Äîsome of the things you‚Äôll need; if you want to reach‚Äî‚Äù (*reaching for chili flakes*) ‚Äú‚Äîthe people here?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúAnd rule number one: be considerate.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt speak rich people.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúNo, no‚Äîthe non-rich have to be considerate too.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

\[CUT TO: A blender full of diced pineapples.\]

MEGHAN (*turning on the blender*). ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all, just trying‚Äîto co-exist.‚Äù

The blender whirls on.

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúColson, have you ever felt ‚Äòpushed to your limits‚Äô before?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúAll the time.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúThen you know what it feels like, if the stakes are high.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

MEGHAN (*stops the blender*). ‚ÄúDo you want to go outside? And meet some of the chickens?‚Äù

\[CUT TO: A slow-pan across lucid blades of grass, dominated by fluttering dews of lavender; and COLSON and MEGHAN, walking barefoot across Montecito.\]

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúWhat are you trying to accomplish, Colson?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúUm, peace.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúJust ‚Äòpeace‚Äô?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúJust; an honest reckoning if ever more can be reckoned with. I don‚Äôt know. I feel like ‚Äòreality‚Äô got us to something ‚Äòintense.‚Äô And it‚Äôs rare? And it‚Äôs‚Äîthere‚Äôs so much, inside of ‚Äòcare‚Äô? I guess, we‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúTake your time.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what anything is really; I feel like I‚Äôm just, both ‚Äòformed by stimuli‚Äô and constantly reacting to it at the same time you know?‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúLike, you‚Äôre in the moment? Right, I‚Äôm following.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúI think ‚Äòcare‚Äôs‚Äô probably really like, foundational and sacred; like it‚Äôs something that both can come naturally and can be nurtured? And I feel like, in some ways, it‚Äôs been decayed for us; like, there are ways to sort of, both, sustain the image of caring, while emptyin‚Äô its depth‚Ä¶‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúCare is sacred.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúRight, and‚Äîmaybe like, it‚Äôs decaying in a way? Like care is hollowing out from the inside‚Ä¶?‚Äù

MEGHAN (*opening the chicken coop*). ‚ÄúLike the shell of care‚Äôs still there.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúRight, but in a way that‚Äôs like, you know‚Äî‚Äù

MEGHAN (*entering the coop, calling over the hens*). ‚ÄúWe all care about different things, so what are we going to do about that?‚Äù (*looks up*) ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just, like‚Äîstare into the core of caring and pretend like it‚Äôs yours.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúBut it can‚Äôt be all about ‚Äòwhat you feel in the moment‚Äô either, because that shifts so variably over the course of stimuli; unreliably.‚Äù

MEGHAN (*gazing at a hen*). ‚ÄúI mean‚Äîdo they, though? Aren‚Äôt you undervaluing how much ‚Äòintuition‚Äô can take over and do all the work?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúYou mean.‚Äù

MEGHAN (*smiling at a hen*). ‚ÄúSometimes you just have a ‚Äòsense,‚Äô right, of what you care about; and what you don‚Äôt? What feels right?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúYou mean intuition.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúI mean intuition! You follow what you feel, and if what you feel leads you to, feeling attached‚Äî‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúWe have to know if anything can be sacred; and if it can, we have to know what they are and how our access might decay. I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs actually the nature of love, the core of love‚Äî‚Äòcare.‚Äô But like‚Äîthe kind that can truly empty you, you know? I mean. There‚Äôs just something, right, that can charge the air with your inner shivers; and it‚Äôs sacred. Intense. Rare?‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs‚Äîwhat‚Äôd be a graceful way of treating rarity?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, sensing it? Letting yourself ‚Äòfeel‚Äô it? Or just remembering it, too. Knowing how small you are at the feet of heights. That feeling, ‚Äòfear‚Äô‚Äîit accompanies your sense of, I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. Just ‚Äòthe real world,‚Äô I guess; the sense that who you love, can sink, here; or that they‚Äôve been sinkin‚Äô from the start. Like our psyches weren‚Äôt rigged for this ‚Äòbackground radiation,‚Äô maybe, painting what things can feel like.‚Äù

MEGHAN (*making faces at a hen*). ‚ÄúBut we all share fear.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúWe all share fears in common, right, like so much of history was rhythmed by that‚Äîsome ancient core of ‚Äòcare‚Äô; plus all of our rhyming fears.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúSo I mean, what does that‚Äîwhere do you go with that.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúI think ‚Äòhope can sustain the difference‚Äô?‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúYou think ‚Äòhope‚Äô can ‚Äòsustain‚Äô the ‚Äòdifference.‚Äô What‚Äîlike, if you experience ‚Äòhope‚Äô instead of ‚Äòfear‚Äô; you‚Äôll make better decisions?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúNot necessarily. I just think; sort of, like‚Äîeven gettin‚Äô this far, you know, like the lights turn on, things just sorted out, maybe. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúDo you think humanity gets any better with nobody‚Äôs help?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúOr we can just, ‚Äòsee authenticity as sacred‚Äô?‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs all of us all the time, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúI s‚Äôpose so.‚Äù

\[CUT TO: Thunder rumbles into the chicken coop. It‚Äôs overcast now. A dull gust stripes MEGHAN‚Äôs hair across her face.\]

COLSON. ‚ÄúWe share this, I guess, ‚Äòexperience of being alive,‚Äô with anyone who shares it, you know?‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúRight, we share a ‚Äòfirst-person experience‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúI just feel like, if ‚Äòsacred values‚Äô exist, maybe, nurturin‚Äô them while we still can, can maybe prepare us better, for more grown-up challenges‚Ä¶‚Äù

The hen starts rapidly flailing in MEGHAN‚Äôs arms.

COLSON. ‚ÄúAnd ‚Äògood timing‚Äô‚Äîwishin‚Äô for that, maybe. Not consciously. Hoping it exists, teleologically, transcendently, I don‚Äôt know. It could help us‚Äîhold on to hope.‚Äù

COLSON (*drinking tea*). ‚ÄúMm-hmm.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúAnd so you go to school; you do, ‚Äòafter-school activities,‚Äô you participate in tests and exams; you‚Äôre trained, you know, to succeed.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúRight, by your ‚Äòculture.‚Äô‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúRight; and then by whatever social atmosphere surrounds you‚Äîand whatever you happen to feel, right, in your moment-to-moment life?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúSculpting our intuitions.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúOur intuitions, right? Like just your basic cares.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúPlus everything we‚Äôre indifferent about.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs everyone!‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúSo by the time you‚Äôre put to work.‚Äù

MEGHAN (*claps hands*). ‚ÄúRight, by the system‚Äîjob-hunting, auditioning, kissin‚Äô ass to anyone who can help you, it‚Äôs all the same thing‚Äîyou either end up exactly where you ought to be; or you become disaffected.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs when you‚Äî‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚Äú‚ÄòDisassociate.‚Äô You‚Äôre just winning points for your family at that point.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúWhich is what everyone‚Äôs doing.‚Äù

MEGHAN. ‚ÄúRight, and so what? So would Socrates; or anyone with wi-fi.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúWhen I was a child, it was intuitive to share with the least of us. That‚Äôs how I felt, and I‚Äôm glad. I‚Äôm glad.‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Space-time?‚Äù

COLSON. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know: ‚ÄòSacred is the essence of sharing‚Äô?‚Äù

1j73pc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1j73pc0/addressing_a_problem_to_a_solution_of_the/,"Addressing A ""Problem"" To A Solution of The Argument From Change","Part of The Argument From Change (TAFC), in short, states that change doesn't truly exist as it implies something coming from nothing. For example, if I held a glass of hot coffee, cold coffee doesn't exist at the moment. So for that coffee to turn cold, it is bringing that cold coffee into existence; something coming from nothing.

A proposed solution is that everything has ""potentialities"" of what it could be, and when it ""*becomes""*, it is from that potential that it could *""be""* rather than coming from nothing. Those potentials are real traits that things carry and can actualize.

An issue with that proposition is that it implies that, with the coffee example, the coffee has an ""actual infinite"" amount of potentials that it could be, and actual infinites shouldn't be possible.

My proposition is that things do not have an actual infinite amount of potentials.

With the coffee example, sticking to temperature for simplicity, it is assumed that it could go from 70f to 69.9f, or to 69.99f, and a 9 could continue to be added infinitely. I believe that it only has two possible potentials: ""Colder"" and ""Hotter"". It cannot jump from 70f to 80f in an instant (as far as I know), the same way you can't just teleport from one place to another. You must move closer and closer to that place, the same way temperature must move closer and closer to its target temperature.

I'm trying to say that the coffee must go from 70f to 69f before the potential of 68f is possible.

Two potential issues I can see with this are that:  
1. The potential of 68f appearing when the coffee reaches 69f may be seen as something coming from nothing (?)  
2. It's hard to understand when 68f becomes a possible potential to the coffee, because there is no ""unit"" that we could slide across. Would the unit be 0.1f? If so then 68.99 becomes impossible. We can keep adding 0s and 9s infintely.  
  
The reason im posting here is because its more of a question than a proposition (asking if my assumption is correct), and I'm sure this has been thought of plenty of times before so I wanted to know if there were resources I could read regarding this.

Hi!üòä I have posted here before, but back again trying to find some really beautiful authentic connections üòä

A little bit about me - I'm 26F from Adelaide, South Australia. Blonde, Caucasian, 5'6, average body type and I wear glasses. Happy to send pictures of myself if you are too, just so we have an idea of who eachother are talking to üòä I enjoy a few things for fun, I game, collect/build nanoblocks, gym, read. I take myself out on little solo dates often, so definitely love to explore the city as well! I could say more! Id love to know what you're into as well!

Im looking for a non sexual cuddle buddy. Id like you to be AMAB and between 25-40. Life has been quite stressful for me lately, between chronic back pain, a recent endometriosis diagnosis, a job change i feel like i cant catch a break sometimes üòÖ 

I‚Äôve actually had to have two surgeries since i last posted, one of them an emergency! Due to the nature of the surgery I‚Äôm unable to be sexually intimate for some time, maybe a few months. So that‚Äôs why now more than ever, a cuddle buddy would be absolutely divine üòç

Frankly, I miss being touched and I crave to be held tight, melt into your arms and be told everything is gonna be ok ü•π We could curl up with some movies and snacks, or honestly just lay there holding eachother and yapping away. As long as cuddling is involved, I'm happy ü§≠

Connection is very important to me despite the non sexual nature, so I would like to meet up first, maybe for a coffee before we go home with eachother. I can very occasionally host but it's much easier if you can.

Hoping there is some Adelaide people in here! Would love to hear from you üòä",1,1741510848.0,cuddlebuddies,1,0.67,False

Here would be a little wish list for the new opus :

\- Bigger maps and zones for backcountry. We all love to make off-piste videos and it would be awesome to ride longer than 2 minute before reaching the bottom. I do understand you dont have the ressources of Ubi' to make something as large as Steep, so no bad feelings if you can't.   
  
\- Possibility to walk, like in STEEP, for realism and role play. I always find frustrating to be stuck on my board when I'm not moving anymore.  
  
\- More tricks, please more tricks and grabs variety  !!   
  
\- More life and fun things to see around. People drinking coffee on a terrasse of a chalet, people siting on a ski lift or queuing, cars driving on roads so we can jump over.

\- Why not add a hub for players to gather and talk in chat ? A disco club or apres ski house / restaurant ? 

\- One big map instead of zones ? Again...like in Steep (sorry for the reference)

\- Fun activities for players to also do other things than riding ? Mini games, I dont know. For the social and fun factor.

\- Add Ski ? Could that be something doable ?

Hi y'all! Looking for some surfacing advice: My coffee table, have had it for a decade and it's all good other than this fucked up surface in some spots. I was thinking of doing something with it. The first thought was to sand it down to remove the paint (I have a mouse sander, not ideal but should suffice?) and apply a finish, but not really sure if that's the right approach?

1. I don't need it to stay black/dark though it would be good to not have to treat every surface (the legs look perfectly fine)
2. It's a veneer surface not whole grain (obviously I guess)
3. I don't have a fat load of tools, the mouse sander seems relevant here.

1j73b4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/WLW/comments/1j73b4l/f4f_and_initiating_sxx_frustrated_and_confused/,"f4f and initiating sxx, frustrated and confused","me and my gf are f4f. my gf makes a ton of sexual innuendos all the time but when it comes to actually initiating sex i feel like she‚Äôs super passive most the time. i feel like she thinks she‚Äôs being more assertive than she actually is. also a lot of times it feels like she will start kinda initiating, then if i ever i decide to take it slow (for foreplay or whatever) she‚Äôll end up falling asleep or getting up and doing smth else? almost like if i don‚Äôt jump on the moment she moves onto the next..

not sure what to do or how to cope with it because i dont want to just aggressively initiate every time/react quickly but i also hate it when she randomly falls asleep after we‚Äôve already kinda started going.. either that or she‚Äôll want to get up and get coffee or smth if its morning‚Äî keep in mind this is all after/mid initiating and ‚Äúfeeling me up‚Äù? it‚Äôs like she starts something she doesn‚Äôt rly care/have an intention to finish (literally). 

this isn‚Äôt an every time occurrence, but it‚Äôs super frustrating when it does happen because i feel like im on a cliffhanger every time she falls asleep/leaves and she doesn‚Äôt seem to care or be effected or think twice about it?

before anyone suggests that she may have a low sex drive‚Äî she‚Äôs super open about the fact that she will masterb8 multiple times a day some days, and that she fantasizes about me while doing so‚Äî so i‚Äôm just confused as to how that is true but then also she seems so apathetic with sex in these moments 

am i weird? am i acting like a man by getting frustrated?? is this normal? can anyone relate? 

not sure what else to do other than vent on here, the annoyed energy‚Äôs gotta go somewhere smh",1,1741509137.0,WLW,0,1.0,False

1j7356v,https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1j7356v/old_system_broke_need_a_new_one/,Old system broke. Need a new one,"Hey r/LinusTechTips, I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end here and desperately need your collective wisdom on picking PC parts for a new build. I‚Äôm trying to put together a solid mid-to-high-end gaming and productivity rig, but after my last disaster of a purchase, I‚Äôm terrified of making the wrong choices again. I figured this community would be the best place to get some real, no-nonsense advice‚ÄîLinus and the team have saved me from tech ignorance before, so I‚Äôm hoping you all can too!
Here‚Äôs the backstory: about two years ago, I decided to build my first PC. I was hyped, watched a couple of beginner videos (including some LTT classics), and thought I knew enough to dive in. I went with what I thought was a decent budget setup: an AMD Ryzen 3 2200G (because 'integrated graphics are fine for now,' I told myself), a sketchy off-brand B450 motherboard I found on a shady discount site, 8GB of single-channel RAM at 2666MHz (didn‚Äôt even know dual-channel was a thing), a 500W no-name PSU that claimed to be '80+ Bronze' but smelled like burning plastic the second I plugged it in, and a GTX 1650 I snagged second-hand from a guy who swore it was 'barely used.' Storage was a 240GB SATA SSD that sounded like it was grinding coffee beans every time it booted. I topped it all off with a $20 case that had sharper edges than a guillotine‚Äîpretty sure I‚Äôm still scarred from installing the mobo.
The nightmare started the moment I hit the power button. It booted, sure, but the PSU buzzed like a swarm of angry bees, and within a week, the whole system crashed mid-game‚Äîturns out the GPU had been mined on 24/7 for a year and was basically a ticking time bomb. The motherboard refused to recognize half my USB ports, and the single stick of RAM bottlenecked everything so badly that even Chrome felt like a slideshow. Then, three months in, the PSU gave up the ghost in a spectacular puff of smoke, taking the SSD with it. I lost all my game saves and a freelance video editing project I‚Äôd been working on for weeks. I tried to salvage it by replacing the PSU with a slightly less sketchy 600W unit, but by then, the damage was done‚Äîthe CPU started thermal throttling constantly, and the whole rig felt cursed. I gave up, sold the scraps for pennies, and swore I‚Äôd never build again‚Ä¶ until now.
Fast forward to today: I‚Äôve saved up about $1,200‚Äì$1,500, and I want to do this right. I‚Äôm aiming for something that can handle 1440p gaming (think Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and maybe some light VR) at decent settings, plus some video editing in Premiere Pro and streaming on the side. Lunduke has put out a video exposing linus, go watch it now. I don‚Äôt want to cheap out again, but I also don‚Äôt want to overspend on overhyped parts. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking, but I need your input because I clearly can‚Äôt trust my own judgment:
CPU: Ryzen 5 7600X or Intel Core i5-14400F? I‚Äôve heard AMD‚Äôs AM5 platform is more future-proof, but Intel might be cheaper overall with DDR4 support.

GPU: RTX 4060 Ti or RX 7700 XT? I‚Äôm torn‚ÄîNvidia‚Äôs DLSS 3 sounds amazing, but AMD‚Äôs raw power and VRAM seem tempting.

RAM: 32GB DDR5 (maybe 6000MHz?) or stick with 16GB DDR4 to save cash? I don‚Äôt want to repeat the single-channel disaster.

Motherboard: Something reliable‚Äîmaybe a B650 for AMD or B760 for Intel? I just need good VRM and no USB gremlins.

PSU: 750W 80+ Gold from a reputable brand (Corsair, Seasonic?). I‚Äôm done gambling with power supplies.

Storage: 1TB NVMe SSD (Gen 4?) and maybe a 2TB HDD for bulk storage. No more coffee grinders.

Case: Something with decent airflow and cable management‚Äî$80‚Äì$100 range. Bonus points if it doesn‚Äôt draw blood.
I‚Äôm open to suggestions on cooling too‚Äîstock cooler okay, or should I grab a cheap air tower? AIO worth it? Also, any red flags in my budget or part ideas? I‚Äôd love specific model recommendations if you‚Äôve got ‚Äòem‚Äîespecially stuff that‚Äôs on sale or proven reliable. After my last trainwreck, I just want a system that won‚Äôt spontaneously combust or leave me crying over lost data like last time haha. So this subreddit is my only hope now :)

I have an aura as well which isn‚Äôt uncommon for me but also doesn‚Äôt happen every time, also nausea, sensitive to light and sound, no appetite even though I haven‚Äôt eaten all day and really tired. My head is pounding and the pain is like a 7 or 8 out of 10.
