The machine is not mine I‚Äôm helping out a friend who would really like her very expensive coffee maker to work without spending hundreds of dollars to get it fixed.

To begin with the machine seems to work fine except for dispensing the coffee at the end of the coffee making process and making the red ring. It starts off fine by making noises and grinding the beans but when it comes time to dispense the coffee nothing comes out.I‚Äôve tried cleaning out the grinder fully and making sure no beans were causing it to get stuck. I cleaned out the transport worm (It‚Äôs a bit black at the end and a little misshaped but I bent it straight).I‚Äôve tried turning it off and on again/unplugging it and plugging it back in. I read that some people had success by turning the disposal wheel a couple of times but to no success.

If anyone‚Äôs has an idea of what‚Äôs wrong please let me know. I feel like it‚Äôs time to give up but it‚Äôs very hard to give up on such an amazing cup of coffee.",1,1731362952.0,SpinnCoffee,0,1.0,False

I tend to have a RBF in general and I wonder if that deters guys from approaching me. Barely recently I had the confidence to get the number of this dude at a coffee shop I frequent and we were talking for a bit before he ended up ghosting me, but I was just glad that I pushed myself to do that without alcohol.

While he is supportive and helpful overall, I can also imagine my life without him. A realistic one where the house won‚Äôt be as clean because he does most of the cleaning, I won‚Äôt have as much money since he‚Äôs been helping me invest. I won‚Äôt be as healthy since he‚Äôs cooks a lot of the meals so I‚Äôd probably have to learn how to cook more which is something I‚Äôd want to do more.

But this may be because we‚Äôre arguing recently, but my life would also be more peaceful. I‚Äôd go out more for coffees since he doesn‚Äôt like cafes, I‚Äôd go to the gym more because that‚Äôs what you do when you have more time, I‚Äôd hang out with friends more.

1gp4oag,https://www.reddit.com/r/NomadStories/comments/1gp4oag/where_you_feel_loved/,Where You Feel Loved,"The first night in the van was a night I will never forget. I was freezing, shivering under my blankets and the five pairs of socks I put on. The cold seemed to have consumed the van. Tears streaming down my face. I remember thinking ""I'm stronger than this."" but it was no good. The silence was terrifying‚Äîno distant sounds from the television, no arguments with my mother with whomever she had over that night. I felt an emptiness that felt over whelming and vast.  
  
I was being smothered in loneliness, which was strange. I felt alone since Jake left, but this was different. It was deeper than anything I'd felt before. I hugged myself tight, something I've done dozens of times before to feel loved, but it didn't help this time. I was consumed in doubt. Had I made a terrible mistake? The freedom I'd chased now felt like a void, and the open road ahead seemed endless and uncertain. The shadows in the van stretched long and shapeless, mirroring the fear that settled in my chest.  
  
Just then, Max stirred from his spot near the front seat. He padded over quietly and nudged his nose against my hand. He knew me too well. He knew what I was feeling. It was almost like he felt the same things I did. He settled down right next to me, his body warm and solid against the cold night. I leaned into him, letting the steady rhythm of his breathing calm the storm of emotions swirling inside. Somehow, Max was more than just my dog in that moment.  
  
He was my steady ground, the one thing keeping me from drifting off into the loneliness. With him there, the shadows didn‚Äôt seem quite so heavy, and the van felt a bit more like home. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes, the tight knot in my chest loosening, just enough for sleep to come. Tomorrow, I‚Äôd figure out where I was going. But for tonight, I wasn‚Äôt alone.  
  
I must have woken up a hundred times that night. Every creak and shift in the van pulled me back from sleep, and by the time the sun started creeping through the windows, I‚Äôd had enough. I threw off the blankets and climbed out of bed, hoping that getting moving might distract me from everything I‚Äôd been feeling.  
  
I fed Max, boiled water for coffee, and tried to settle into a simple routine. It felt strange, almost like I was acting out someone else‚Äôs morning, but I went through the motions anyway. Pour the coffee. Take a breath. Look out the window. With each small step, I felt myself settling, waking up a bit more to this new life.  
  
Max sat nearby, watching me intently, his tail thumping when I finally sat down. I took a sip of coffee, letting its warmth ground me as I looked around at the soft light filtering through the trees. It wasn‚Äôt much, but it was something‚Äîa beginning. And maybe, just maybe, that was enough for now.  
  
The hunger hit me out of nowhere‚Äîa hollow ache I hadn‚Äôt noticed until now. I realized I hadn‚Äôt eaten a single thing since I left. I hadn‚Äôt even thought to bring food; there was nothing worth grabbing from home, just empty cupboards and shelves that seemed to echo back at me. I‚Äôd gotten used to it, I guess‚Äîignoring that empty feeling. But now, on my own, it wasn‚Äôt something I could just brush off.  
  
I looked at Max and he looked back at me. I didn't say anything but he seemed to already know we were about to get going. I climbed into the front, started the old van, and started driving, praying to a God I didn't know that I would find something to eat. We didn't have mobile phones or GPS back then so I just started driving. A hot meal was all I wanted in that moment. Fortunately, there were no other cars on the road at that time so I drove slow enough that I could keep a lookout for someplace warm.

I can‚Äôt remember the name of the place, but it looked nice enough‚Äîa small roadside diner with a flickering neon sign in the window. I parked the van, leaving Max inside, and headed in. The moment I stepped through the door, everyone turned to stare. It was like I‚Äôd just walked in from another planet, and they were seeing a person like me for the first time. I‚Äôll explain that look later, but in that moment, I felt every set of eyes lingering a little too long.  
  
Then a sweet older waitress caught my eye, giving me a warm smile. ‚ÄúSit wherever you like, hon,‚Äù she called out. Her voice was soft, like she could sense I needed a little kindness. I chose a spot at the counter, far enough from anyone else. The place smelled like coffee and pancakes, and for the first time in a while, I felt myself start to relax, even if just a little.  
  
As I sat there, a man settled onto the stool a couple of seats down. He looked like he‚Äôd spent his life in that diner‚Äîa well-worn cap resting on graying hair, his face etched with lines that could‚Äôve come from both laughter and long days in the sun. His clothes were a bit worn, hands rough and calloused, the kind that tell stories all on their own. I remember as soon as he sat down a coffee was placed in front of him. Like he'd been coming to this diner and sitting in that exact seat since the place opened.  
  
‚ÄúWhere you from?‚Äù he asked. His voice reminded me of a mechanic that used to work down the street from where I grew up. It was a deeper voice and he spoke slow like he was never in a hurry.  
  
I didn't know how to answer. I'm not sure if it was the sad look in my eyes or that I didn't respond fast enough but he seemed to know I didn't want to tell him. Without waiting for me to respond he jumped in and started talking. I don't think he was asking me so he could share himself. Instead, I think he started telling me his story because he knew I didn't want to share mine.  
  
‚ÄúMy wife passed a few years back,‚Äù he said, his gaze drifting to the worn countertop as he spoke. ‚ÄúBeen on my own since. Got a daughter, though‚Äîshe‚Äôs about your age, I‚Äôd say. Moved to the big city. Tries to make it work out there.‚Äù He chuckled, though there was a bit of sadness in it. ‚ÄúOnly calls when she needs money, but‚Ä¶ I send it every time. Happy just to hear her voice.‚Äù  
  
I listened, feeling the tension I‚Äôd carried in with me start to ease. There was something comforting in his voice, the way he just kept talking, sharing pieces of his life with a stranger without asking for anything back. His stories filled the quiet, his words warm and familiar, like they‚Äôd been waiting for someone to catch them. It felt good to sit there and listen, wrapped up in someone else‚Äôs world for a change.  
  
For the first time in a long while, I didn‚Äôt feel the urge to pull away.  
  
I started to notice how everyone in the diner seemed to know each other‚Äînods, smiles, easy conversations drifting around like they‚Äôd all done this a hundred times before. I must have looked a little puzzled, trying to piece together the feeling of familiarity that hung in the air, because when the man caught my expression, he chuckled softly.  
  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all been coming here, sitting in these exact seats, for years,‚Äù he said with a grin. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only new face we‚Äôve seen in here at this hour in months.‚Äù  
  
His words made me feel both seen and out of place at the same time. I was an outsider, drifting through the middle of their long-established routine. But somehow, instead of feeling awkward, I felt almost welcomed, like I was part of the morning ritual, if only for today. His smile made me feel like, maybe, I was exactly where I needed to be, at least for this moment.  
  
I didn't know it at the time but this is probably the moment that my life as a nomad began. Sitting in a new place, surrounded by people I didn't know who somehow felt like I'd known them all my life, I felt like I belonged, even though it was the first time I was there. It was a feeling I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd been missing‚Äîa blend of comfort and detachment, of being part of something without being tied down. That feeling would follow me, becoming something of a guide, a reminder that home wasn‚Äôt a place but the moments and people that brought me to life, no matter where I was.  
  
As we talked, I found myself starting to open up. I told him about my life, about Jake‚Äîhow he‚Äôd always been there for me, how he‚Äôd been like a parent when our real ones couldn‚Äôt be. I mentioned Max, how Jake had left him with me, this small piece of himself that I could hold onto. And then I let it slip. That I left home. That I was out here without a plan.  
  
The old man listened without interrupting, just sipping his coffee, with enough eye contact that I knew he was listening but not too much that made me feel overwhelmed. When I was done speaking, he took a few moments to gather his thoughts and then said something that changed my life. ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù he started, ‚Äúevery time my daughter comes home, she says, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm glad to be home,‚Äô even though she hasn‚Äôt lived with me in years.‚Äù He paused, then dropped a bomb. ‚ÄúHome is where you feel loved.‚Äù  
  
Those words landed hard, sinking in deep. He looked me in the eye and asked, ‚ÄúSo, where do you feel loved?‚Äù  
  
Without thinking, I pictured Jake‚Äîthe way he‚Äôd always been there, right up until the day he wasn‚Äôt. I wondered, just for a second, if maybe I could find him. Then I remembered how he‚Äôd once talked about heading down south, surfing and living by the beach. I didn‚Äôt know exactly where, but it was something, a direction. And right now, that was all I needed.

1gp4ny0,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1gp4ny0/keep_getting_fatter_when_i_eat_the_recommended_fat/,"Keep getting fatter when I eat the ""recommended"" fat","I'll try to be very succinct with the background info here:  
5'9"", male, 35y.o.  Carnivore + coffee for 6 years.  Eggs.  No dairy.  
Heavy lifting 5 days per week, approx. 1hr per session.  
8hrs of sleep per night.  
Only 1 mug of coffee first thing in the morning, and absolutely no caffeine after that.  
Red meat and eggs only.

I have tried to ramp up my fat to ""recommended"" levels three times in these six years.  I see a massive spike in my sex drive, which suggests lots of other less-visible benefits also.  BUT... I gain weight drastically.

My lowest weight in the last six years was 182lbs and my highest was 206lbs.  
182 wasn't sustainable because I reached it by eating VERY little and hating life.  
185-190 felt exactly right, and I maintained a 30-31"" waist.  
195+ was indicative that I was slipping.

My goal: Get back to 185-190, with that 30-31"" waist.  
Currently: 202lbs, 34.5"" waist.

I don't have the money to buy specific cuts of meat from the grocery store.  I buy a side of beef at a time from a local farmer, and I eat whatever I pull out of my freezer next.  I eat local eggs.  I cook only in tallow, and everything is seared blue-rare in a skillet.  I don't consume a lot of rendered fat - I try to keep it to only the solid fat on each cut.  Ultimately, though, I don't get to be picky about the cuts of beef or the lean:fat ratio.  The best I can do to control it is to cut away the visible chunks of fat and save them for later (rendering, crispy bits, etc.)

It bears repeating, preceding my questions: I've done this for SIX YEARS.  
**1) Is there some higher level of adaptation (particularly fat adaptation) that I never achieved?**  
~~1b) Is anyone going to summon the mods from the other carnivore subreddits to come tell me I must be lying?~~  
**2) Has anyone had better outcomes by keeping their diet leaner than the common recommendation?  Are there any major drawbacks with that?**

I hate to keep going with this, thinking that I'm doing something wrong.  It's why I keep second- (third-, fourth-) guessing myself and increasing my fat proportions, thinking that there's some as-of-yet unexperienced  magical benefit of this diet for me.  You know how the rationale goes: when so many people are attesting to something different than me, maybe I'm wrong.

I'll admit as a final note: I tried higher-fat again when I started slipping upward through the 190s, and stalled around 196-198 for months.  I missed the vascularity, the abdominal definition, and the angular cheeks and jawline.  I have no idea what was causing that gradual gain, but it wasn't muscle, bone mass, or (solely) water weight.

I'll leave it there.  Can anyone give me some insight on those questions?",1,1731362814.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

The endless void that stretches beyond the horizon into unfathomable depths, the existence of stars, planets, and cosmic phenomena offer a gateway to the unknown. It‚Äôs a place where the boundaries of science blur, paving the way for discoveries in regions untouched by human knowledge.¬†

When you‚Äôre floating aimlessly through the cosmos, the silence can often weigh heavily upon you and the solitude and boredom of space can be‚Ä¶.*haunting*, and I would agree. In the vastness of the Interstellar void, you are but a whisper, merely insignificant against the backdrop of infinite obscurity. Earth could never match the exhilarating isolation of space.

My mission was anything but simple, and what it was no longer matters. To be honest, I‚Äôd rather spare you the details‚Äîfor your own safety. Just know this: I wasn‚Äôt a man of faith, not before. But now... I‚Äôm not so sure anymore.¬†

Three weeks ago, HQ had intercepted a transmission from an unknown signal. We‚Äôve encountered similar transmissions before which are often misidentified as echoes from nearby satellites‚Äîthis one was‚Ä¶‚Ä¶quite different.¬†

\*	\*	\*

When I emerged from my standard cryo-pod, there was an incessant beeping echoing through the command deck. A message from HQ‚Ä¶ I tapped the console, bringing the message into clearer focus. The voice crackled through the comms, tense but steady.

""Captain Cross... We‚Äôve received a transmission from the Rosette Nebula... but something‚Äôs off. The signal is weak, distorted‚Äîbarely holding. It's not on any known frequency. We can‚Äôt trace the source.""

I blinked at the flickering display, trying to wrap my head around it. The Rosette Nebula? That‚Äôs over 5,000 light-years away‚Ä¶ *How is it reaching us now?*

""Are we certain that the signal is not from a stray satellite?"" I asked, initializing the caffeine synth dispenser. It hummed to life, producing the liquid in seconds.

""Confirmed, Captain,"" the comms officer responded, his voice steady. ""The signal‚Äôs unique‚Äîit‚Äôs being transmitted by a device specifically calibrated to penetrate the dense dust clouds of the Rosette Nebula. No other tech in this sector uses this frequency.""

I stared at the monitor, unsettled. The nebula's gas clouds might be interfering... but a signal from that distance? It shouldn't even be possible.

‚ÄúPatch it through,‚Äù I ordered, my voice calm, though the air felt heavier around me. There was a long pause, a static hiss, then the screen illuminated, revealing some sort of notations

Œî ‚àÖ | # | ‚ÖÉ Œî ‚ä§ | ‚àò ‚àÖ

‚ÄúHave we deciphered them yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly the first 3 notations‚Äù

‚Ä¶.A-N-N‚Ä¶.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre currently working to decode the remaining characters‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI'll maintain standby for any incoming transmission. Have we received any data bursts or signals from the Nebula Explorer V1?‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, Captain. We‚Äôve isolated Connors in quarantine protocols. It appears he's gone into self-confinement for now, but we're working on extracting him.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been four weeks since our last deployment and four days without contact. Are we certain he‚Äôs stable?‚Äù

‚ÄúAffirmative, Captain. His biometrics are active and nominal.‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs off. I‚Äôve got a bad feeling about this‚Ä¶ Maybe I should initiate a manual inspection.‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, Captain. Protocol is clear‚Äîyour directive is to remain on standby. We can‚Äôt authorize an EVA transfer to the other vessel. Resume your current assignments and await further instructions.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood, I‚Äôll proceed with my scheduled tasks for the day‚Äù¬†

A brief silence followed, then came the crisp response: ‚ÄòAffirmative, Captain.‚Äô‚Äù

I‚Äôve been running diagnostics on the ship‚Äôs propulsion systems for the past few days, ensuring all modules are functioning within optimal parameters. My next task was to recalibrate the oxygen filtration system, but honestly, that‚Äôs routine at this point. HQ had also assigned me to monitor deep space comms, the Nebula Explorer V1 was the vessel sent before me. Between that and the scheduled exterior hull inspection later this week, I‚Äôve had my hands full.¬†

Still, none of these tasks were enough to distract me from the uneasy silence coming from Connors. Four days without contact‚Äîit‚Äôs gnawing at me‚Ä¶.

‚ÄúConnors, have you ever thought about what‚Äôs out there?‚Äù I asked him one evening, the low hum of the ship‚Äôs systems providing a backdrop to our conversation. We were in the common area, sipping recycled coffee as we stared out at the stars.

He leaned back in his chair, a distant look in his eyes. ‚ÄúYou mean besides the endless void? Yeah, I‚Äôve thought about it. But what‚Äôs really out there? It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ vast emptiness. It can get overwhelming.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs a double-edged sword. On one hand, it‚Äôs beautiful. On the other, it‚Äôs suffocating. It‚Äôs hard to shake the feeling of isolation.‚Äù

Connors sighed, scratching his chin. ‚ÄúYou know, when I signed up for this mission, I thought I‚Äôd be doing something monumental. Discovering new worlds, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. But sometimes, I wonder if it‚Äôs worth it. The solitude can feel like a weight pressing down on you.‚Äù

I chuckled softly, trying to lighten the mood. ‚ÄúYou signed up for the trip, Connors. You knew what you were getting into‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù he replied, but I noticed a flicker of uncertainty in his eyes. ‚ÄúJust promise me you won‚Äôt get lost out there, okay? I‚Äôd hate to have to send a search party after you.‚Äù

‚ÄúLikewise, my friend,‚Äù I said, raising my coffee cup in a mock toast. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make a pact. If either of us goes quiet for too long, the other comes looking.‚Äù

*‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù*

I immersed myself in my daily tasks, gathering atmospheric readings, carbon pressure levels, and scanning for any new star formations in the vicinity. *That‚Äôs when I heard it‚Ä¶.*

A slow, deliberate tapping through the metal hull. It was faint at first, almost like a whisper and I mostly ignored it. Until it cut through the tranquility of the ship. I paused‚Ä¶.straining my ears against the silence that followed, only to be met with an unsettling stillness that felt almost oppressive. Then it came again, a gentle tapping, like fingers drumming on the surface of the universe itself. My pulse quickened as I stepped cautiously towards the command room.¬†

*Until the alarms deafened me‚Ä¶.*

""Status report!"" I barked, my voice barely rising above the cacophony of sirens.

The ship's AI flickered to life, its voice steady but laced with urgency. ""Warning: Unidentified object detected in proximity. Trajectory indicates potential collision course. Estimated time to impact: three minutes.""

My heart raced as I glanced at the sensor readouts, a cluster of data scrolling rapidly across the screen. An unidentified object? My mind raced through possibilities, each more chilling than the last. What have I stumbled upon? an asteroid? No, the Ships AI must have identified it‚Ä¶

I gripped the console as I focused on the blaring alerts. ‚ÄúDivert all power to shields! Prepare for evasive maneuvers!‚Äù I commanded.

I couldn‚Äôt see outside; for some reason, it was dark and blurry. The vessel slammed into something. I hadn‚Äôt engaged my safety harness, and I was violently ejected from my command seat, my body tumbling against the bulkhead.

The AI hummed, its voice urgent, piercing through the chaos.

*WARNING... WARNING... WARNING...*

I couldn‚Äôt see outside. I didn‚Äôt know what I had hit‚Äîsome unseen object in the void‚Äîuntil it became silent. The alarm ceased, leaving an eerie quiet in its wake. My heart raced as I pushed myself upright, the cold metal of the console digging into my back.

‚ÄúStatus report!‚Äù I shouted, forcing my voice to remain steady despite the dread that clawed at my insides.

‚ÄúSystems compromised,‚Äù the AI replied, its tone dispassionate as ever. ‚ÄúShields at fifty percent. Hull integrity fluctuating. Unknown entity detected‚Äîlocation: 030 mark 18.‚Äù

I blinked, struggling to comprehend. Unknown entity? ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚Äòunknown entity‚Äô? Can we identify it?‚Äù

‚ÄúInsufficient data. Visual feeds are compromised. Recommend initiating external scan.‚Äù

I rubbed the back of my neck, feeling the tension knotting deeper. ‚ÄúDo it. Get me eyes on whatever we collided with.‚Äù

As the AI began its scanning process, I took a moment to gather my thoughts. The darkness outside my viewport felt oppressive, swallowing the starlight, as if the universe itself was watching me. I fought against the rising tide of panic.

‚Äú*Come on, come on‚Ä¶‚Äù* I muttered under my breath, staring at the flickering display as it struggled to process the input.

Suddenly, the screen cleared, revealing a shadowy silhouette drifting just beyond the hull. A massive structure, alien and unsettling, loomed ominously against the void. Its surface was textured, like a complex web of dark materials, pulsating with an eerie glow.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is that?‚Äù I breathed, fear coursing through my veins. ‚ÄúAI, enhance the scan! Identify that structure!‚Äù

‚ÄúEnhancing now,‚Äù it responded. The screen pulsed as the AI processed data, but the results were slow. A dread began to settle in my gut‚Äîa feeling that whatever lay before me was more than just an object in space.

‚ÄúCaptain,‚Äù the AI finally said, ‚ÄúI cannot identify the structure. Preliminary scans indicate it emits an unusual energy signature. Suggest caution in approaching.‚Äù

Caution? I was already too close. My heart raced as I tried to think clearly, weighing my options. Should I attempt to maneuver away? Or would it be better to try and communicate?

I hesitated, uncertainty gnawing at me. Just then, a series of faint vibrations reverberated through the ship. It felt like a heartbeat, rhythmic and steady, sending shivers down my spine.

‚ÄúAI, did you detect that?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúAffirmative. The structure appears to be reacting to our presence. Energy levels are rising.‚Äù

With a sinking feeling, I realized the entity had noticed me. Whatever it was, it was alive‚Äî*and it was watching*\*\*.\*\*

‚ÄúPrepare for any incoming transmissions,‚Äù I ordered, adrenaline pumping through me. ‚ÄúWe need to know what we‚Äôre dealing with.‚Äù

But as I waited, the silence returned, heavier this time, as if the very fabric of space held its breath. I felt utterly exposed, trapped in a cocoon of darkness, with only the unknown entity before me.

‚ÄúAI, keep the shields at maximum,‚Äù I commanded, feeling a knot of fear tighten in my stomach. ‚ÄúIf it decides to attack, I want to be ready.‚Äù

Then, as abruptly as it had started, everything fell silent. The oppressive stillness enveloped me, leaving only the sound of my own heartbeat echoing in my ears. I was alone with my thoughts, the tension thick enough to slice.

The darkness outside the viewport pressed against the hull like a weight, a reminder of the vast, uncaring universe surrounding me. I could almost feel the cold expanse of space wrapping around my ship, isolating me further from any sense of normalcy. My mind raced, piecing together the fragments of what had just occurred. What had I hit?

I forced myself to take a deep breath, steadying my pulse. I had to assess the situation. I fumbled for the control panel, my fingers brushing against the cold metal as I reestablished my grip. The interface flickered to life, the dim glow illuminating the command deck like a distant star in the void.

‚ÄúAI, status check!‚Äù I commanded, my voice steadier than I felt.

‚ÄúSystems are nominal,‚Äù the AI replied, its synthesized voice echoing through the stillness. ‚ÄúHowever, navigational sensors are offline, and visual feeds remain compromised. Energy levels are fluctuating within normal parameters.‚Äù

Normal? The word felt almost absurd in this context. ‚ÄúWhat about external scans? Can you provide any data on what we collided with?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnalyzing‚Ä¶ no significant anomalies detected in the immediate vicinity. The object is classified as an unknown entity. Energy readings indicate a strong electromagnetic field surrounding it.‚Äù

I squinted at the monitor, frustration gnawing at me. ‚ÄúGive me a visual feed if you can.‚Äù

The screen pulsed, and for a brief moment, static danced across the display before settling on an image‚Äîa vast, shadowy mass drifted silently beyond my hull, its contours indistinct in the darkness, yet undeniably present.

‚ÄúCan you enhance that?‚Äù I asked, my breath catching in my throat.

‚ÄúEnhancing image‚Ä¶ completed,‚Äù the AI responded. The silhouette sharpened, revealing a complex structure, interwoven with what appeared to be organic-like tendrils that pulsated faintly, as if alive.

My heart raced; *‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that?*‚Äù

‚ÄúUnknown,‚Äù the AI repeated. ‚ÄúFurther scans are required to ascertain its properties and intentions. Recommend maintaining a safe distance while attempting to establish communication protocols.‚Äù

I felt a chill run down my spine. Communication? I didn‚Äôt want to communicate with whatever the hell this thing was

‚ÄúCan we initiate contact?‚Äù

‚ÄúAttempting to establish contact,‚Äù the AI replied, the console lighting up with a series of beeps and whirs.

I gripped the edge of the control panel, anticipation thrumming in my veins. A moment passed, the silence wrapping around me like a shroud. Then came the response‚Äîa low-frequency hum, resonating through the ship, sending vibrations rattling through the hull.

Œî ‚àÖ | # | ‚ÖÉ Œî ‚ä§ | ‚àò ‚àÖ

‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù I whispered, staring at the screen as it displayed a notation.

‚ÄúUnidentified transmission detected,‚Äù the AI stated. ‚ÄúFrequency modulation is inconsistent with known communication methods.‚Äù

It sounded almost‚Ä¶ organic, like the pulse of a heartbeat echoing in the stillness.

‚ÄúCan you decode it?‚Äù I pressed, every instinct telling me to be cautious.

‚ÄúOnly three Initials; A-N-N....Insufficient data to decipher further intent or meaning. Recommend further analysis and monitoring.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, my mind racing. Here I was, a speck in the void, facing a phenomenon that defied everything I knew about the universe. I was on the edge of discovery‚Äîor *destruction*.

‚ÄúPrepare to initiate a deep-space scan of that entity,‚Äù I ordered, forcing myself to maintain focus despite the rising tide of uncertainty. ‚ÄúAnd keep the shields at full power. I don‚Äôt want to find out what it can do.‚Äù

A small static came when the AI replied, ‚ÄúAffirmative, Captain.‚Äù

As I settled into my seat, the weight of isolation pressed down on me again. I was alone, drifting through the depths of space, waiting to uncover the secrets of an entity that seemed all too aware of my presence. Suddenly, HQ crackled to life over the comms, the voice of my superior cutting through the silence. ‚ÄúCaptain Cross‚Ä¶ Report your findings‚Ä¶‚Äù

I straightened in my seat, adrenaline coursing through me. ‚ÄúCommander Hayes, I‚Äî‚Äù My voice faltered for a moment as I glanced at the ominous mass on the screen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve encountered an unknown entity in the vicinity. The collision has compromised navigational sensors, but I‚Äôm attempting to assess its properties.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnknown entity?‚Äù Hayes‚Äôs tone was sharp, laced with urgency. ‚ÄúAre you in danger?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure,‚Äù I replied, trying to maintain my composure. ‚ÄúThe entity appears to be‚Ä¶ alive, or at least it has organic characteristics. It‚Äôs emitting a low-frequency signal that I‚Äôm currently analyzing. I recommend sending a probe to gather more data before we make any decisions.‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, Captain. We cannot risk losing another asset. Maintain distance and gather intel from your current position. Can you confirm the object‚Äôs stability?‚Äù

‚ÄúStability is unclear. It‚Äôs pulsating and‚Äî‚Äù My words caught in my throat as the entity shifted slightly on the screen. *It‚Ä¶‚Ä¶What the fuck‚Ä¶.It seems to be reacting to our presence.‚Äù*

‚ÄúIs it attempting communication?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet,‚Äù I admitted, my eyes narrowing at the screen. The pulsing intensified, the low hum deepening in tone, resonating in a way that felt almost‚Äîintentional. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ trying to talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúCaptain, you‚Äôre to prioritize your safety above all else. Do not engage unless absolutely necessary,‚Äù Hayes warned, his voice steely.¬†

I clenched my fists, frustration bubbling beneath the surface. ‚ÄúCommander, if this entity poses a threat, we might not have the luxury of waiting. If we don‚Äôt act now, we could lose the opportunity to understand it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour priority is to ensure the safety of the mission,‚Äù he repeated firmly. ‚ÄúMaintain monitoring and keep me updated. HQ out.‚Äù

The comms went silent again, leaving me in the oppressive quiet of the command deck. I glanced at the console, the waveform still pulsing in front of me. The low-frequency hum began to shift again, its rhythm changing, more urgent now.

‚ÄúAI, can you analyze that change in the signal?‚Äù I asked, my heart racing.

‚ÄúAnalyzing‚Ä¶ The signal exhibits patterns reminiscent of communication methods unrecognizable,‚Äù the AI reported. ‚ÄúPossible attempts to convey a message. However, the modulation remains unique and indecipherable.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you approximate its intent?‚Äù

‚ÄúInsufficient data. However, it may imply curiosity or caution.‚Äù

Curiosity or caution? In the cold embrace of space, either could spell destruction.

‚ÄúActivate the external camera feed,‚Äù I ordered. The display flickered, and the viewport illuminated, revealing the entity in full view. It's dark mass loomed large against the backdrop of stars, its tendrils undulating slowly, almost as if they were breathing.

‚ÄúAI, initiate a slow rotation of the ship. I want to get a full visual of this thing without moving too close,‚Äù I instructed, hoping to buy time while my mind raced through the possibilities.

‚ÄúAffirmative,‚Äù the AI responded, and the vessel began to turn.

As I watched the entity shift and ripple in the starlight, an unshakable feeling of dread settled over me. I had ventured into the unknown, and now *I was staring into the abyss, waiting for it to gaze back.*

After what felt like an eternity, a rhythmic sound echoed through the metallic hull of the vessel.

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

I tried to ignore it, but the noise was relentless, like a heartbeat in the silence of space. There was something far more terrifying awaiting me beyond that sound‚Äîsomething that could lead the mission into‚Ä¶..*Annihilation*.

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

The sound grew louder, filling the empty corridors of the vessel

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*¬†

I tightened my grip on the control panel, feeling a chill creep up my spine despite the warmth of my suit.

I scanned the monitors, hoping to find something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat might explain the noise. Yet, the screens showed nothing but the static hum of deep space. The vast darkness loomed beyond the hull, pressing against the ship as if something massive and unseen watched from the void.

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

I tried to focus on the entity‚Ä¶. *But this noise‚Ä¶* this endless, insistent drumming‚Ä¶ was like a warning, echoing from some primal depth I couldn‚Äôt understand.

Suddenly, the lights flickered, casting strange shadows across the bridge. I forced myself to breathe, slow and steady, but my heart raced in time with that infernal beat.¬†

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

A faint voice crackled through the comm system. ‚Äú*Ethan*‚Ä¶‚Äù

I froze. That voice‚Äîit sounded distorted, stretched by static, but familiar. *Impossible*.¬†

*Conners? My voice ached‚Ä¶..*

‚Äú*Ethan‚Ä¶.‚Äù*

The lights dimmed entirely, and the darkness became suffocating. The sound now pounded in my ears.

I turned, but I was alone. Or so I thought. In the shadows at the edge of the bridge, a figure began to form, outlined by the faint emergency lights. The face came last‚Äîhis face. *Conners*. He stared at me, hollow-eyed, as if peering from some eternal abyss.

*""Did you think it would end with me?‚Äù* he whispered, his voice barely more than a rasp against the drumming beat.¬†

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

Panic clawed at my mind as I took a step back, my boots heavy, rooted to the floor. I tried to speak, to explain, but words failed.

And then, as I watched, he stepped forward, his gaze burning with a fury that transcended death, his figure shifting and flickering like static on a broken screen.

‚Äú*Ethan*‚Ä¶..‚Äù he murmured, each syllable dripping with bitterness. ""*You will face it too as I have faced*‚Ä¶..*Complete and utter‚Ä¶.Annihilation*""

# Chapter 1/Prologue

Noah Williams

Captain of the MCS Tai Lastimosa (keel laid after the destruction of the Fold Weapon)

5 years before the advances into Federation space

‚Äî

Even the Frontier must have a fringe. An area of unknown that a budding civilization struggles and grapples with.¬† It is where pioneers are forged and the forgotten fade into obscurity.¬† It's where the Syndicate lays its roots, its tendrils infesting the scars of neglected worlds left behind in the Frontier War.¬† As much as I despise its presence as a hive of depravity and corporate transgression, it‚Äôs one of the best places for command experience. Be it pirates, IMC remnants, or god forbid, IMC Aries Division fleets given new life from stripmined worlds, the Frontiers rim was the perfect place to see anything and everything while shepherding colonists headed into the unknown.¬†¬†

And so here I am, drinking a cup of coffee-or whatever imitation the machine in the mess hall spits out-on the bridge of one of the militia's newer MacAllan-Class carriers, overseeing a routine patrol.¬† Just the MCS Tai Lastimosa, named rightfully so after a mentor lost on Typhon, two Columbia-class cruisers, a Crusader destroyer and one of those new Birmingham-class battlecruisers.¬† Small but sufficient, and well-armed enough to deal with any sizable Syndicate factions that weren't on favourable terms with us and to assist any colonies in a resource pinch from pirates.¬† We were the tip of the spear of the joint colonization effort of the Frontier Militia into the outer fringes of explored space.

Overlooking the bridge, I saw a comm request from Sara Rosario, captain of the MCS Resolute, the Birmingham-Class battlecruiser off our port side, flash onto my console.¬† As I accepted the request, I raised a hand a greeting toward my friend and counterpart, humour lacing my voice. ‚ÄúA fine survey to you. What do you need Sara?‚Äù.¬†¬†

Sara‚Äôs face appeared on the screen, an amused grin on her mouth. ‚ÄúA fine survey to you, Noah,‚Äù she acknowledged.¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve picked up an unknown subspace entry, a couple systems away, with our long-range scanners. Might be something worth checking out.‚Äù

I leaned back in my chair, sipping from my cup.¬† ‚ÄúMight be a good time to test our combat readiness.‚Äù I motioned to my XO, ‚ÄúTake the task force to Condition Orange and get us those trajectories from the Resolute.‚Äù¬†

He acknowledged my order and started issuing orders to the Lastimosa and her accompanying escorts.¬† As I felt the ship's thrusters roar to life through the hull, the ship's klaxon sounded off: ‚ÄúAll hands, all hands to stations, we are responding to a ghost contact in system Helios-47B. All officers prepare your stations for combat. Jump in 1 minute.‚Äù¬†

I braced myself for the telltale bending and flashing of colours that signified humanity's outright defiance of physics.¬† ‚ÄúFleet jumping in 3‚Ä¶2‚Ä¶1‚Ä¶mark!‚Äù the ship's PA announced.¬† Almost instantaneously, our set of stars in front of us blended into specks of blinding white light, and within the span of a few seconds reformed into a new backdrop, blocked by a smattering of unknown ships.

The ships, jagged and almost fanged in their design, were burning hard for the system limit even as we watched.¬† Some were intact; others were obviously damaged, venting gases and debris from various spots on their hulls. I stood up, motioning towards my bridges Combat Information Center to open up a channel to broadcast towards the unknown fleet¬† ‚ÄúThis is the MCS Tai Lastimosa flagship, of the Militia Battlegroup Osiris, responding to unknown contacts in system Helios-47B.¬† On behalf of the MCS, please state your intentions in this system, and if you require aid of any kind.‚Äù¬†

As I waited for a response, another crewmember manning CIC shouted out, ‚ÄúVampire, Vampire, Vampire! Multiple inbound from multiple points in the unknown contacts!¬† CIWS and flak emplacements tracking all inbound threats!‚Äù¬†

I reached for the fleet-wide comm channel. ‚ÄúAll ships, we are at Condition Red! Unknowns are burning hard for the system limit. Operational contacts and inbound threats are highest on your target queue‚Äîaim for hardpoints. I want a live one!‚Äù

Stynek, Venlil child, unknown

‚Äî

Pain permeated through every cell of my body.¬† All hope of returning home had ended with the home fleet‚Äôs parting shots.¬† I had hoped against hope that the fleet could have caught up or disabled the cattle ship I was on, but that ended with the ship's departure from the system.¬† I could sense the Arxur surrounding the cattle pens growing increasingly impatient and frustrated by the damage they‚Äôd sustained while fleeing the system. I tried to shrink further into the corner, hoping to evade their hungry gazes.¬†

Despite my best efforts, one particularly large Arxur noticed me and began stalking through the walkways, drawing closer with each step. Suddenly, the ship shuddered and groaned, components sparking around the compartment.¬† The Arxur in the chamber reeled, momentarily distracted and off balance by fires and shouted orders.¬† Holes appeared in the compartments to the right of us, venting atmosphere before plates slammed into place, sealing the breaches. The sudden shift in atmosphere combined with distant weapon fire sent the cattle pens into a frenzy of fear and uneasiness as Arxur ran towards weapons lockers and armoured compartments.¬†

Abruptly, the reactor‚Äôs power cut off, and with it the artificial gravity as well. Predator and prey alike struggled to attain footing and handholds.¬† Then, just as suddenly, the whole ship settled back into gravity again with a thud, haphazardly tossing around anything that wasn't tied down. Arxur crew members struggled to their feet, cohesion slowly being regained only to be lost again as yells of confusion filtered through the comm channels.¬† From what I could overhear the fleet had encountered another and, thinking it to be more prey, had immediately fired upon it.¬† However, weakened and outnumbered as they were, it seemed they had failed.¬†¬†

My only confusion was why the ship had regained power after its damage.¬† And while I was at it- why would a prey fleet willingly attack the Arxur? A heavy *thunk* resounded through the hull beside me, drawing every Arxur‚Äôs attention.¬† Seconds passed before the Arxur jerked upright-only to vanish in an inward explosion of shrapnel, fragments, and blood. Out of the smoke and debris, something emerged: a bipedal figure, like a Venlil, but fundamentally wrong.¬† Its cold metallic frame gleamed even in the murk, the strange alloys catching the dim lighting. Rounds ricocheted off its chassis as it moved undeterred with swift, mechanical strides, rotating to target the nearest Arxur dispatching them with a burst of fire that tore through its shoulder, spraying fragments against the wall in a sickening display.¬† It seemed to tower over me as it advanced deeper into the hold, the harsh lights inset into what amounted to its head cutting through the murk with an unblinking, piercing brightness.¬†¬†

As I recoiled from the shower of viscera, I looked up to see an imposing figure step forward flanked by two more of the bipedal metal figures.¬† A tall figure clad in unknown metals and fabrics became visible, reflecting a cold gleam. But as he turned in my direction, two orbs filled with focused, predatory calculation flicked over me.¬† My heart pounded as I recoiled, the implication of another race of sentient space-faring predators striking me.¬† Were they here to contest the Arxur‚Äôs presence? To take their haul of prey?¬† The federation‚Äôs mistake of uplifting the Arxur had resulted in hundred of years of war and cost us millions of lives; what would another race of predators mean for the galaxy?¬†¬†

As the armoured figure surveyed the room, it took notice of me huddled in the corner.¬† It stepped forward, the unnatural mechanical guardians always at its side, heads swivelling.¬† I braced myself for my death, hoping it would be quick and painless.¬† But nothing happened.¬† My ears flicked, picking up guttural alien speech directed at me.¬† I looked up, the figure reaching down towards me with a five-fingered hand. Its imposing binocular eyes remained focused on me but instead of being filled with an insatiable hunger, they held worry and concern.¬†¬†

Its hand remained outreached, and again it said something, but this time my translator had managed to pick up enough to construe its speech.

‚Äî-

I knelt down next to the alien child-at least, I assumed it was a child-beckoning gently. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôve been treated hellishly, from the looks of your condition now, but I could use your help just this once. You‚Äôve been on this ship longer than I have, so if‚Ä¶if you can understand me, I need you to point me in a helpful direction.‚Äù¬†

The little furred being hadn't stopped trembling since I'd approached, but slowly, the severity of the shaking seemed to ease a bit.¬† After a hesitant pause and a few flicks of its tail and ears, it shakily pointed towards a corridor that led deeper into the ship.¬† I nodded and started to stand up but was stopped by the alien tugging at my pant leg. The alien looked down in thought for a moment, and then lifted its arms up.¬† I chuckled softly, leaning down to lift the small being onto my back.¬† Slowly standing, I walked past the squads of grunts pouring through the breach, sweeping the area to secure combatants and prisoners alike for medical attention or later analysis.¬† The two prototype Stalkers at my side shifted back into a walking position, mechanisms clicking as they advanced forward toward the waiting squad of Spectres waiting in the corridor.¬†¬†

Styenk¬†

‚Äî

The strange,potentially friendly-predator hoisted me onto its back and we pressed onwards towards the command deck of the Arxur cattle ship.¬† Two bulkier machines flanked it, heads constantly swivelling even as their bodies faced forwards.¬† In front of them, a group of ten smaller machines advanced, weathering hundreds of rounds while signalling an Arxur‚Äôs demise with each staccato burst of gunfire.¬† I squeezed my eyes shut against the sprays of viscera, wondering if aiding the predator I rode atop had been the right move.¬† I knew it was a predator, there was no mistaking those front-facing eyes-but it hadn‚Äôt succumbed to its instincts and devoured me as it towered over.¬† Even if its race was at odds with the Arxur for prey, there was no reason for it to have cooperated with prey.¬†¬†

I opened my eyes as the predator crouched behind one of the machines.¬† It‚Äôs weapon echoed down the corridor, sharp pops suppressing and ending threats as they appeared.¬† Yet even as the machines unnatural accuracy ripped through the Arxur‚Äôs ranks, it seemed as if they were just getting started.¬† At the end of the hallway, a trio of Arxur were handing out heavier antivehicle munitions.¬† Several machines swivelled to target the trio, but their aim was blocked by the sheer amount of combatants. A sharp crash behind us heralded the arrival of an Arxur falling from a vent in the ceiling.¬†¬†

Wheeling around, one of the larger machines grabbed the Arxur‚Äôs neck in its hand and clenched, crushing it.¬† Without pause, it swivelled again raking the ceiling with a high-capacity gun, rounds thundering out and tearing gashes through the metal.¬† My ears rang as the cacophony intensified, and I barely noticed my predator speaking into a commlink on its wrist.¬† *Havoc*, the only word I could hear repeatedly through the din.¬†¬†

I slid down to the ground, clasping my hands over my ears, trying to melt into the floor beneath me.¬† Still glowing shell casings fell around me as the battle escalated, staccato pings clashing with the thunderous soundwaves of antivehicle rounds echoing in the cramped space.¬† A metal arm spun through the air beside me as Arxur munitions found their mark. Faintly, through the metal, vibrations from something immense quickly became apparent, tremors overpowering the reverberations in the corridor.¬† A horrible screeching filled the air as massive metal hands gained purchase, wrenching away an entire section of the hull.

Rounds that had just demolished the head of a machine in front of me froze and hovered mid-air as it raised a pulsating blue field in front of us.¬† The Arxur must have fired into that glowing field for a whole second before the collection of ammunition spat out in the opposite direction ,shredding the barricade and everything behind it.¬† As I watched, the giant bipedal walker swivelled, moving terrifyingly fast for its size, dispatching Arxur with casual and efficient brutality-backhanding or simply crushing them in its grasp.¬†¬†

Dizziness washed over me like a tide, the violence unfolding in front of me too much to process.¬† My vision blurred and darkened as my thoughts spun. What conflicts could birth such brutal weapons from even a predator‚Äôs mind?¬† The casual brutality of the metal behemoth as it tore through the Arxur, limbs moving with an unnatural fluidity.¬† Just as the metal *thing* finished its rampage through the Arxur, it turned back around to face me.¬† My heart started to pound again, as my eyes started to roll back, the world slipping away, plunging me into comforting darkness.¬†¬†",8,1731362152.0,NatureofPredators,6,1.0,False

I was even wheeled through the slop by an Ophanim who accused me of blasphemy. I can still hear his smarmy, scolding voice.
   
‚ÄúWhat gives you the right to deny Wonder Workers their divine duties? Imagine how the psychopomps would feel if everyone in the United Heavens had ferries of their own. Tell me, Tabris. Did your department even consider the other classes before bringing this to the table?‚Äù
   
*Yes, of course. How could we forget the other classes? The Virtues and the Archangels* love *being bumper to bumper with Valkyries and Sidhe on the highway to Avalon. How dare we threaten to deprive them of that experience!*
   
Clattering footsteps thunder over the sound of idling engines. In my driver-side mirror, a group of hobbling laborers appears. All are in various states of paused decomposition.
   
*And how foolish of us to try to save the city money by preventing the Blest Resurrected from getting swept away in the tides.*
   
Where the AWWs are often delayed, the Bureau of Asclepius is meticulously punctual. Souls from Limbo are risen before dawn. Their naturally lobotomized minds are incorporeally provided inherent knowledge of their assigned tasks. The problem is, there isn‚Äôt room for any other information in their decrepit brains.
   
I turn up the chorus of Cherubs on the radio and watch the undead imbeciles breach the river‚Äôs edge. Within seconds, waves are crashing against their shoulders. Still, they plod further into the black depths. A century ago I would have stepped out of my vehicle, run before them, screaming at them to stop and turn around. At present, I silently scowl as their bobbing heads jettison away in the undertow. Never to reach their designated places behind janitorial carts, barista counters, and taxi windshields.  
   
*Whelp. That‚Äôs my morning coffee and at least thirty thousand pieces of taxpayer silver gone downstream. Judas will be reeling over operating costs later, but he still won‚Äôt vote ‚Äòyes‚Äô on Prop. 153. No, no. Can‚Äôt have nets disrupting our view of the ethereal skyline!*
   
My fingers curl over the steering wheel and I take a deep breath, *Don‚Äôt get yourself worked into a tizzy, Tabris. Remember what Jesus said‚Äî‚Äòthe miracle schedules are being adjusted to suit our growing needs.‚Äô You just have to be patient while the Divine Council gets things straight. Things will improve by the turn of the millennium. We may even reach our office by then!*
   
To my utter surprise, a true miracle happens‚Äîthere is movement a few cars ahead. A laugh of relief bellows from my lungs as my tires inch forward. I drive over the river, finally reaching the main road running through Avalon, and arrive at the Department of Heavenly Transportation. 
   
Despite the rough start to my day, I enter the boardroom with my wings lifted in a haughty plume. 
   
‚ÄúGood morning, dear colleagues!‚Äù
   
The greeting is met with a resounding groan. 
   
‚ÄúI know, I know. It took an hour and a half for me to get through that mess at the river, too. But while I was sitting there, I got to thinking. What if we bussed the Blest Ressurected into town?‚Äù
   
‚ÄúWhat if we just left the river driveable?‚Äù A lesser Principality grumbles.
   
‚ÄúYeah! Why do we have to wait for the Workers‚Äô all the time? Couldn‚Äôt they work in shifts to maintain the transmutation?‚Äù The reedy voice of a Tengu chimes in. 
   
‚ÄúExcellent points. Azazel, note this down for the next docket. Our campaign slogan will be, ‚ÄòBecause you shouldn‚Äôt have to wait for a miracle‚Äô.‚Äù 
   
For the first time in decades, members of the Transportation Board murmur in agreement. Scheduling plans, route adjustments, and fund allocation ideas begin to pour from their celestial mouths.
   
*This might actually work!* I think as I beam into the newly determined faces around me.

I looked at Longines, Tudor, Grand Seiko and all but didn't find any that called to me. So I figured I'd just hold off. A job change + relocation meant I needed to increase my safety net as well, so put any watch purchases on the back burner.

And then one day, on a walk, me and my gf stopped by the Omega Boutique just for fun. And that's when the salesperson showed me this. It was an instant love for me and my gf. The blue-grey dial especially was stunning. After thinking about it over coffee, we decided to pull the trigger, and went back to pick it up. 

And that's how the First Omega in Space became my first Omega! 

Oh and it's only today I noticed that the Omega logo that's usually seen on the dome of the hesalite Speedy is present on this Sapphire dome as well. Which I thought was pretty cool! It was hard to capture a photo of that though. ",15,1731362070.0,OmegaWatches,0,1.0,False

I have done every single blood and intolerance test and tried different creams (acnatac included), but nothing ever helped. I eat a lot of carbs and proteins (meat) because I work out. I also drink just water and coffee and unfortunately I lack  fruits and eat not enough vegetables (once a day) but I take vitamin supplements. Apart from this I also have a lot of stress/depression, and the acne appears to be on the head and chest too. Have you ever dealt with and healed from something so bad? It just doesn't go away and my face is also red.

I am 42 & started having symptoms of what I thought were a UTI about 3 weeks ago--burning, urgency, frequency of urination increased, etc. I've only ever had one UTI in my entire life before this.

I made an appnt & had 3 separate urinalysis tests done as they said some of my results made the sample seem contaminated. In all of these, there was no evidence of culture growing so DR said not a UTI. I had small hemoglobin, very high squamous cells, small leukocytes & white blood cells found.

DR informed me this is IC and I've been dealing w it for 3 weeks now & having absolutely no quality of life- can't leave the house as I'm in too much pain & discomfort.

I immediately cut out carbonation, sugar, coffee, & vitamin c/citrus. I am noticing my worse symptom is extreme vulva dryness & irritation- was just wondering if any others also have this as an overarching symptom. I read online that many have significant pain in perineum but I have none there. I do still have burning upon urination at times.

I have requested a referral to Urology & I'm getting denied for it (Kaiser BS) but I think that is my best shot going forward.  I also read that IC usually isn't diagnosed until 6 or more weeks so feel as though DR isn't super interested in helping me to get to the bottom of this.

1gp4ahs,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1gp4ahs/need_some_advice/,Need Some Advice," It all started when we met in college last year. We were working on the same project, exchanged phone numbers, got along pretty well, and started texting every so often. I didn‚Äôt ask her, but she mentioned she had a boyfriend, and I didn‚Äôt say anything about having feelings for her (which I do) and carried on with the rest of the school year.
One year later, on a random night, I hadn‚Äôt thought about this girl since college, but all of a sudden she came to mind, and I was thinking, 'I wonder what she‚Äôs up to.' The next day, she followed me on Instagram! I was like, there‚Äôs no way‚ÄîI was just thinking about her, and the next day she followed me. I was so happy. I followed her back, and we started talking and getting along great.
A couple of days later, she asked me, 'Do you like me?' and I said, 'Yes, I do like you‚Ä¶' She mentioned she broke up with her boyfriend a month ago. When she told me that, I was thrilled; she also mentioned that the reason she was being distant with me before was because she was catching feelings for me and didn‚Äôt want to ruin her relationship, which I totally understood. Then, in almost every text she sent, she started repeating the last letter of words, like 'Awwww' or 'Totallyyyyy.'
Now we‚Äôve started to flirt with each other, and I wanted to do random things with her, like going to a movie theater or restaurant. She even wanted me to go with her to her friend‚Äôs wedding as her plus-one, lol. I hadn‚Äôt seen her for a while, so she invited me to come by her work, where she‚Äôd give me a free coffee. Before I went, I bought her a bag of her favorite candy and decorated it with our favorite football teams. When I arrived, my heart was racing‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt believe my crush from college liked me. As soon as I walked in, she smiled and gave me a hug, and she really liked the gift I gave her. We talked when she was on her break, and I noticed some good body language‚Äîwhen a girl gets shy or nervous, she often plays with her hair, which she did. We talked for about twenty minutes, and when her break was almost over, she walked me to my car. We hugged twice, and they were long hugs. I thanked her for the coffee, and I was on my way home.
Before we met up, she‚Äôd told me her parents are strict and that she wanted to focus on herself before starting to date again, and I was cool with that. At this point in the story, you‚Äôre probably thinking, 'Okay, there‚Äôs no way this story can get weird, right?' But the next day, I texted her to say thanks again for last night and that I hoped she enjoyed her candy. She replied, 'You‚Äôre welcome, and thank you for the candy.' I asked about her day, and she said it went well. Then she texted me this:
'I also spoke with my parents right now and told them about you and I just you know hanging out but my parents don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good for me right now to be talking with someone cause they ya know assume and were right I have some feelings for you but they think it‚Äôs too soon because of the break up and honestly they might be right (my name), you‚Äôre the sweetest and super caring trust me when I say that but I know my parents at the end of the day want what‚Äôs best for me, and plz don‚Äôt hate me but they‚Äôre making my brother go with me to the wedding since he‚Äôs already gonna be in town, I‚Äôm so so sorry I promise its nothing against you, I just know that they‚Äôre right maybe it‚Äôs best if I do just focus on myself right now and I would have told you this in person but they just told me right now and I wouldn‚Äôt want to wait to do that, that‚Äôs not right, if you ever want a free coffee though lol you‚Äôre more than happy to visit me or come to me with any advice I just need to figure out some things right now I‚Äôm sorry.'
I replied, 'Thank you for being honest with me, I could never hate you, I totally understand where your parents are coming from, and I respect your decision to focus on yourself right now, just know that I care about you and I‚Äôm here if you ever want to talk or hang out, even if it‚Äôs just for coffee, take your time to figure things out, and I‚Äôll be here when you‚Äôre ready.' She responded, 'Thank you (my name), I really appreciate that.'
We haven‚Äôt texted for a month, but she posted something on Instagram of her at the wedding. When I saw it, it had been up for a few hours. I liked the post but didn‚Äôt say anything. Later that night, after work, I noticed she had unfollowed me on Instagram when I checked my profile and saw my follower count had dropped and this happened yesterday and also, she didn‚Äôt block me on Instagram.

Hello everyone, I'm in the process of putting together a new PC and wanted to get a general opinion, as this is only my third self-built PC.

I know how to assemble a PC and which parts can be combined with which. What I lack, however, is experience and knowledge in areas such as temperature and the goodness of certain components. 

I'm building my next PC with the focus of gaming, not for working. I also want to assemble the PC in a nice and clear way. Good cable management, nice components to look at and less RGB, since i have grown out of everything in my room must have RGB. I want a cozy wood / coffee / plant look. 

I have currently put together the following system:

* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 
* AIO: Cooler Master MasterLiquid PL360 Flux
* Motherboard: Asus ProArt X870E-CREATOR (costs only 50 EUR more, than the X670E¬†in my country and I am too lazy to updating the BIOS for the 9800X3D myself - lol)
* RAM: 64GB Kingston FURY Beast DDR5-6000 
* M.2: 2TB + 4TB WD Black SN850X
* Case: Fractal North XL Charcoal Black
* Fans: (to replace the Fractal Stock ones)
   * 3x Noctua NF-A14 iPPC-2000 PWM, 
   * 1x Noctua NF-F12 iPPC-2000 PWM
* PSU: Asus ROG THOR 850P 850 W (from my old system)
* GPU: Asus ROG Strix 3080 OC (from my old system)

  
I want to replace the GPU with a Asus ProArt Nvidia Card, after the 5000 series dropping next year. Maybe an 5080, but depends on the costs.

2. Is the whole System (with maybe an 5080 in the future) maintainable with a 850W PSU?

3. Is the MasterLiquid PL360 Flux capable of cooling the 9800X3D?",0,1731361499.0,PcBuild,4,0.5,False

My 8 year-old son planted about 6 mini pepper seeds a few months ago in a small pot that's the size of a large coffee mug. They were growing well and seemed very healthy as they were bushy and strong. I knew I had to transplant them into their own pots as they were very close together in a confined area. Once I did, they seemed ok for a few days, but then started losing leaves. I live in Phoenix so we get a whole lot of sunshine and i kept them inside next to a window. This is what they look like now. I may have over-watered them when I  transplanted them as well. I put then outside for a couple of days in hours that direct sunlight would help,  but didn't seem to.  Would this cause this? Are they a lost? Can I save them? My son is devastated as they were his little babies. ",1,1731361473.0,plants,0,1.0,False

Photos 1-3 have the chairs by the heater, bench on the long wall, and vanity by the windows so that I can actually see when I‚Äôm putting on my makeup. Both chairs can swivel but only one is close enough to the window to enjoy the view. 

Photos 4-6 have the chairs by the window so I can actually enjoy the gorgeous 9th floor skyline view I have, but vanity on the long wall where I have no light to work or make myself up. 

Photos 7-8 have the chairs in the middle of the room across from the bench, creating a nice seating area, and leaving the rectangle rug open to do yoga by the windows, which was nice. 

The gorgeous sunset happens to the left of the far left window so you can really only see it from the wall by the kitchen, or sitting near the window. 

The only furniture I am deeply attached to are the rattan etag√©re, dark wood bookshelf, MCM walnut coffee table, rattan egg chair, and the pistachio vanity/desk.

I feel like my boyfriend is a narcissist but he called me a narcissist the other day. Im so confused what to do. He has these little quirky things that he‚Äôs started in the past few years, changes, not bad things but I‚Äôm trying to keep up with. Sometimes I forget & to him it‚Äôs the end of the world. Never cook anything unless it‚Äôs stainless steel, I tried to heat water in a pot that wasn‚Äôt. Holy Shit !
Don‚Äôt store anything in plastic. Sumtimes I forget. Can‚Äôt I just remember to do or not do the things the way he likes ? He makes a HUGE deal out of it. But what makes it hard is I‚Äôll do like 10 (small) nice things in a day. May I make u coffee, what would you like for supper, things like that. Then the one thing he bellows to me is ‚Äúyou kno I only eat organic ! This bell pepper isn‚Äôt !‚Äù It‚Äôs like that every day. He can never say anything nice to me. Then he says why can‚Äôt we just talk about this so I sit down, listen to him calmly. Complain about everything I do. The minute I open my mouth to defend or tell him something that HE does to hurt me. He goes back to the beginning of our relationship (15yrs) everything I‚Äôve done wrong from then to now. Basically ruined his life. So I clam up again so he‚Äôll stop yelling & blaming. Then he says again I don‚Äôt talk. I can do nothing then but look at him. Im the beginning I tried telling him 15 yrs ago has nothing to do with now. He doesn‚Äôt see it that way. He use to want go to bedroom (don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs ok to say here) & things were better for 1 day at least. Now immediately after, I do 1 small thing he doesn‚Äôt like he has no problem complaining. He blames everything on me. We almost broke up once long time ago. I cried & cried. Then HE said no babe don‚Äôt go anywhere. Then later told me I loved u so much I couldn‚Äôt let you go. Now he says that I wouldn‚Äôt go so he had nothing to do except tell me to stay.
He actually goes from 15 yrs bac each time we argue & think of everything I‚Äôve done til now that has ruined his life. He even blames me because he quit his job after we‚Äôd been together 5 yrs. Now he hasn‚Äôt got a job & says he can‚Äôt get one while living with me. There are always 2 sides to every story but I swear when we argue I will say, I know I make mistakes but you do too ! He never acknowledges that. He makes me feel guilty about everything. Neither one of us can afford the apartment. I was just trying to co-exist.

I see myself as you must see me:

* who turns your careful kindness into proof of deeper feeling

I understand your relief at my dramatic exit from what was always just friendship to you.  
I see how my intensity made even simple responses feel dangerous, each text a tripwire of emotion

The painful truth? I'm not the deep soul you couldn't fully know, just the friend who needed too much knowing And this finally seeing us clearly?  This is the real wound, not your distance, but my recognition of why you kept it.

I'd rather feel this clean, raw pain than persist in performing connection for someone who I know is relieved to be released.

The industry is just about sympathies and being an extrovert. Everything is fake laughs and kissing each others butts.
I am not that kind of guy, my strengths are in working with the scripts and finding ideas. But no one is listening to me.
My tasks are that of a secretary and I get more and more frustrated with making coffee or preparing meetings where I‚Äôm not taking part in.
My boss told me that there is no opportunity for me to grow. He declined every time I offered myself for something, for example I applied to a trainee position in bookkeeping. Instead they hired a retired 74 year old.
I get micromanaged for anything, even though I never missed a deadline. The boss throws me a bone in letting me read some scripts but without a real project behind it. Its just make believe.

1gp3tuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gp3tuw/sfhr_next_caller/,[SF][HR] Next Caller,"The drive to the station that morning was verging on freezing. The chilly weather had not blown through since the night before when thunder clouds had rolled into town yesterday evening, and the thunder was still rolling in the early hours of this morning. The only good thing about my 3 o‚Äôclock journey to the station was the lack of traffic, I didn‚Äôt have to sit behind a gridlock and freeze my ass off, I could instead freeze my ass off while driving at 60 mph. Even after 30 years of being the host of *Good Morning Seattle!,* the winter months never got easier. Something about driving home when it was dark and cold, and then driving to work when it was dark and cold was off-putting.

Our station's parking lot stood empty except for a brown 85‚Äô Oldsmobile Cutlass. My new producer's stylish ride had probably gotten there an hour or so before I did, and that would probably last another month or so before the new hire's motivation would wear off from the daily grind. The unmanned front lobby had a pot of coffee already brewed; *someone deserves a raise*, I thought. My boot heels clicked on the tile floor as I made my way to the studio.

The on-air sign hanging near the studio door was unlit as I pushed my way inside the small room. Pulling the cracked black leather roller chair underneath me, I grunted the way all old men do; this would be my home for the next eight hours or so. I reviewed that morning‚Äôs notes I took the day before, going through predicted weather, traffic, upcoming events, and so on. Smooth jazz played faintly from the loose headphones around the microphone boom. We must have a few more songs to go because Luke, our Producer and new hire, was not in the production booth.

While I finished the last of my notes, Luke slipped into the production booth unnoticed. When I looked up our eyes met, and he gave a sheepish wave and motioned me to put the headset on. I swigged the last of my coffee and put on the headset.

""We got a huge lineup of callers this morning, Steve! The phone is ringing off the hook. Something‚Äôs got the morning risers in a stir.""

""Well, they can wait, we got at least two more songs till bingo time! Don't you want to finish your coffee?""

Luke was still filling the shoes of the producer who had just retired, and conversation lately had been a little awkward. He looked at me in a shy way, not wanting to push but clearly something was bothering him.

""I'm serious Steve, there‚Äôs a lot of people calling in today and not the usual‚Äôs either. Maybe the shit weather has got everyone roused this morning or something. Either way, I don‚Äôt think it would be a bad idea to start early.""

I had seen it a million times before. A new hire comes in and thinks they know how to fix everything. Their temporary motivation for their new job creates a wave of wanting to prove themselves. Luke was probably still in his early to mid-twenties, so I understood. He's still got the young energy within him; in some ways I envied him.

I let out a sigh, not in annoyance, but acceptance.

""All right, fine. Let‚Äôs do this thing.""

I swung the microphone in front of me as the last song faded out, and my seriously dated intro began to play.

‚ÄúS-S-S-STEEEVVEE in the MORNING. GOOOOOOOOOOD MORNING SEEEEEATTLE.‚Äù The exaggerated voice overlay was capped off with an air horn. Man, oh man, we need to change that soon.

As the last bit of music from the intro played, I then went through my daily morning briefing to the great city of Seattle. Our show had a decent number of listeners, mainly morning commuters or early risers, and played from 4 a.m. to around noon when the afternoon crew rolled in.

""...and it looks like the thundershowers are here to stay this morning and potentially well into the afternoon. Now what you have all been waiting for, let's get to those phones!""

Luke pointed over at me and a small flashing red light on my desk indicated we had someone on the line. With one click of a button near the microphone boom, the first caller was on the air.

""Hey, hey neighbor! How are we doing this morning?""

A raspy woman's voice came through the headset almost as if she was out of breath.

""Steve, h-hi. W-what's going on? What is in the sky? I don't want to look. It *wants* me to, but I don't want to look!""

Slight confusion roused my tired mind, but what was happening finally clicked.

""Uh-oh folks, looks like we got ourselves a prank caller."" A low whistle noise was played by the producer. ""I guess we will have anyone on these days! All right ‚Äòpranker‚Äô, I will indulge you. What's your name?""

""M-mary""

""Alright Mary, what *is* in the sky this morning? It sure as hell *isn't* the sun!"" I forced a fake laugh and the famous *bud-dum-tss* of a snare followed.

""I-I'm not sure. I'll just take a glance... I think‚Ä¶ It's beautiful. It's looking right at me; *he's* **looking** right at me!""

For a second, I really didn't know what to say. But the radio show ‚Äòkiller‚Äô is dead air, and over the years I learned how to improvise.

""Ha-ha Mary, all right you got your kicks. Say goodbye to everyone! I hope you had fun.""

""Steve, you need to loo-""

The line clicked as we cut off the caller. A cuckoo bird played, and Luke and I smiled at one another coyly.

*It's too early for this shit,* I thought. We have plenty of prank callers, but I admit this one made me a little uneasy for my liking. We occasionally have the typical drunk frat kids call in, still awake from the bars that would have closed just a few hours before, but this lady seemed right off her rocker. Something about her voice, she seemed genuinely frightened.

""We all love the prank callers, but come on folks, wasn‚Äôt our Halloween special enough?! All right people, on to the next caller!""

I clicked on the next caller as the light flashed red.

""Hey there Seattelite, how is the commute this breezy November morning? As we approach 5 a.m. hour I know it's probab-""

An elderly man's voice spoke loudly through my headset.

""Don't look in the clouds, whatever you do, **do not** look into the clouds! My poor son, he's gone mad - Steve, you need to tell people not to look up!""

I shot the producer a confused look. How did he manage to get two loons back-to-back? Something on my face registered with him, Luke just shrugged in an ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù sort of way.

""Okay, very funny. I don't know how you managed, but you and your friend Mary are pretty clever! This will go down as one of our-""

""STEVE LISTEN TO ME YOU DUMB FUCK.""

I barely had time to flick my thumb over the button to remove the caller as the outburst happened.

""Sorry folks, we obviously are having some hooligans on air this morning. We apologize for the obscene language. We will take a quick break and be back with some of your fellow morning commuters after *Sister Golden Hair*!""

As *America* started to strum the first few chords, I removed my headset and quickly got up. I stormed into the production booth with a few choice words on my mind.

""Luke, what the fuck was that? You know the FCC can fine us for that kind of language. I get we were told to boost our ratings, but I doubt the big man upstairs is going to be happy with what we got going on this morning. Let's vet the morning crowd out a little bit more going forward, yeah?""

""Man, I don't know what to tell you. I have ten callers on the line right now and every one of them sounds about the same as the last two.""

Did he just say *ten* more callers? We often only have three to four callers at most during the first hour of the show, let alone ten callers. Jesus, was this some sort of coordinated effort? Is some pranking group trying to go viral? Or‚Ä¶ were these *real* callers?

Some words flashed onto the producer's screen, ""NEW CALLER WAITING"" it read. Our phone line now held *eleven* callers.

""Hang up on the ten other callers and let me just take this new call off the air, Luke. If the song ends just throw on the Doobie Brothers or something.""

He flashed me a quick thumbs-up, tapped some buttons on the production panel and handed me an extra headset. Tossing the headset on, I reached toward the screen with the one remaining caller and clicked through the call.

""Hi, this is Steve with Good Morning Seattle. We just wanted to do a quick off-air check-in to see what you would like to talk with us about today.""

A voice barely registered on the headset; a faint whisper could be heard.

""Look up, look up, look up, look up, look up, look up, -""

A loud bang rang on the other end of the line and the sound of the phone clattering to the floor followed, then static. I clicked off the static line.

*What the hell was going on?*

Bright flashes from the lightning outside illuminated the shade-drawn window over the producer's shoulder. Stepping past Luke, I hesitated before pushing my fingers through a flap of the shades, spreading two flaps to get a look outside. Peeking through I looked down three stories to the street below. The storm was still raging and the early morning light still had not come over the horizon, the first signs of light would not come for at least another hour or two. Squinting down to the street below, stormwater had flooded the empty street. Up the road I spotted a car speeding, going at least 60-70 mph, the driver would be crazy to have to go at that speed on these small side streets. Just a second after I noticed it hydroplaned and swerved into an adjacent building; a person ejected from the vehicle and skidded 30 feet from the wreckage. I looked up and down the road, but there were no other cars in sight, I might have been the only one who had seen this terrible crash, we had to call the police!

""Christ, Luke call the- ""As I began to look up and turn toward the producer, something else caught my eye. In the distant horizon across the Puget Sound above the Olympic Mountain range, a shadow loomed in the dark clouds as lightning flashed. Impossibly large wings slowly flapped down, appearing to almost brush the tips of the snow-capped mountains in the distance. The flash faded and I peered harder out across the Sound. In my peripherals, Evergreens stood in the nearby park, whipping back and forth violently as wind gusts picked up loose trash from the surrounding area.

Another flash of lightning illuminated the stormy sky; this time the midsection of the winged beast was clear. Large red eyes gleamed in the dark sky from a swirling tendril-covered face. Even at this distance, I could tell, it was looking *right* at me. I couldn‚Äôt look away; my eyes began to water but I couldn‚Äôt blink. A low guttural voice began speaking to me. It spoke so loudly that I felt my skull vibrate as it reverberated through my eardrums.

‚Äú***Mgr'luh ya ng stell'bsna, Y' ah Cthulhu***‚Äù

My vision began to blur - the red eyes filled them. A vast desert spread out in front of me. The bones of millions and millions of people lay stacked in a grand pile. Scanning my surroundings I saw decaying corpses strewn all around me. Looking down at my arms and legs, they appeared malnourished, and skinny to the bone. Rising panic began filling my body, the horror around me culminating in an internal scream. In the distance, the giant beast filled the horizon, making its way back to its fortress of bones. Wind began whipping the desert sand across my body, gashing away at my thin skin, ripping off all of what I had left on my wilting body. I fell to my knees as I realized I would succumb to the beast soon; the certain doom was inevitable. It would take everything, for it was hungry and that hunger was not yet sated. I could feel its hunger, a bottomless pit never to be filled, a black hole sucking in the universe.

A hand yanked hard on my shoulder, my hand broke away from its fixed spot opening the blinds. I jerked around, fumbling back, and finally fell on my ass. Shifting back to reality I sat there shaking. How long had I been looking through the blinds? How long had I been in that place? Hours, days, months, *years*? My perception of time was completely warped.

Reeling, I looked up at Luke ‚Äì eyes stinging - we were back in the studio. The last few chords of *Sister Golden Hair* finished playing in the background from Luke‚Äôs headset which he now clutched in his hand. I was back in the studio; I had never left the studio. What the *fuck* just happened?

Luke crouched to my level, ‚ÄúSteve! Jesus Christ is everything okay? Why weren‚Äôt you responding to me? Is that blood? A-are you bleeding?‚Äù

I felt what I thought were teardrops from my dried eyes rolling down my cheeks. Wiping my hand at them, a dark red liquid covered my palms. My god, my eyes were bleeding! Clenching my eyes shut, I rubbed them to soothe the sting.

I finally mustered out a response, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt look outside.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Steve, what happened to you? What‚Äôs outside?‚Äù He got up and took a step towards me and the window, hand outstretched.

‚ÄúI said don‚Äôt look god dammit!‚Äù I Smacked his hand away with force.

Luke looked down at me puzzled, the same sheepish look from earlier that morning.

‚ÄúFine Steve, but you need to see a doctor. Your eyes‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt look good.‚Äù

My eyes still burned like crazy, but that was the least of my concern.

‚ÄúLuke, we need to get back on the air. There's something‚Ä¶ something is out there Luke. Something big is coming this way. It's hungry, it wants us; it wants *all* of us. I am not sure what *it* is, but we need to tell people. People need to know! They need to run!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat, are we being attacked? Is it‚Ä¶ terrorists? Another country?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ Its-‚Äù I lacked the words to explain what had just happened to me; to describe what I saw. To describe the hunger; to describe the black hole that the beast was. I clambered for the right words, ‚ÄúThere is something out there that wants to *kill* us. If you look at it, it will kill you. Do you have family in the city? You need to call them right now ‚Äì hell, you need to get to them and get out of town yourself!‚Äù

‚ÄúSteve, you‚Äôre scaring me. You know my family is from Philly, I moved out here for this gig! What the hell is going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need to trust me, Lukey. You need to leave town. Get in your car, drive away and don‚Äôt look back. But before you go, I need you to set me up to go live; I need to warn others!‚Äù

Luke seemed to ponder this. In the momentary silence, the doubled pane glass windows shook in their frames as the wind picked up, howling just outside the studio. The wind was getting stronger as it grew nearer. I could still feel its gaze on me now, it had *seen* me, and it would not forget me. It wanted me; it *needed* me.

Luke finally broke the silence, ‚ÄúI am going to stay with you. I have nowhere to go.‚Äù He looked away troubled and questioning what he just said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna lie though man, I‚Äôm scared. Give it to me straight, are we going to be all right? Are we about to die?‚Äù

Shakily I responded, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but we might be able to save others.‚Äù

We both looked at each other for a moment, not sure of what to say. Luke held out a hand and helped me up, I pulled him into a brief hug.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt leave you.‚Äù I said aloud, trying to give what assurance I could to the young producer.

I walked back out of the production booth and into the studio. Sitting back down on the cracked leather chair, I put the headset back on and swiveled the microphone close, preparing myself as best I could. Luke pointed in my direction, the music from the headset had been cut and we were live once again.

‚ÄúFolks‚Ä¶ there is no easy way to say this, but you must evacuate the city. Drive east, north, or south it doesn‚Äôt matter, but you can‚Äôt stay here. I repeat, you *must* evacuate the city, this is not a joke or a hoax this is *real*.‚Äù

I paused, thinking of what to say next.

‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ this is going to sound crazy. There is a flying creature that- well it's coming to kill us all. You must pack up your family and leave now! Leave as fast as you can!‚Äù

Looking up I saw Luke‚Äôs expression had turned to that of a small child that was confused and scared, he looked helpless. That‚Äôs when Luke‚Äôs words dawned on me.

*Nowhere to go*

‚ÄúIf anyone wants to call our studio we are still here and will remain live for as long as possible. Please call in, our lines are clear. Call 206-555-0206, again 206-555-0206.‚Äù

Almost immediately Luke waved and pointed towards me. The red flashing light pinged on the desk in front of me and I clicked in the first caller.

‚ÄúHello, this is Steve. Where are you and what are you doing?‚Äù

The soft, thin voice of a young girl spoke back.

‚ÄúHi, I need help. My parents are gone, and I just woke up. I heard your voice on the radio, and you told me to call you. Can you help me?‚Äù

The blood in my face drained, I was *not* expecting this.

‚ÄúHi sweetie, everything is going to be okay. Is there anyone else with you in the house? Do you have neighbors?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy older brother is here but he‚Äôs still sleeping. He told me to *never* wake him up, he gets grumpy when I wake him up early and will pick on me if I wake him up.‚Äù

‚ÄúSweetie, you need to wake him up and put him on the phone, it's important.‚Äù

A soft plopping of feet on hardwood could be heard as the young girl ran to her brother.

‚ÄúDanny ‚Äì Danny, you need to wake up. There is someone on the phone for you! Danny, you need to talk to him, wake up!‚Äù

An adolescent boy's voice could be heard in the background.

‚ÄúSaddie, w-what‚Äôs going on‚Ä¶ what time is it?‚Äù Blinds could be heard pulling up from a drawstring. ‚ÄúSaddie, it's still dark outside -¬† you should be in bed. Where‚Äôs mom‚Ä¶ what is that?‚Äù The sound of bedsheets shifted, and the boy‚Äôs voice dragged to a monotone, ‚ÄúOh noooo‚Ä¶ oh no‚Ä¶ oh no‚Ä¶OH NO‚Ä¶ OH NO‚Ä¶‚Äù the boy now shrieked in panic.

Scared, I yelled into the microphone, ‚ÄúSaddie don‚Äôt look out the window! Please no, don‚Äôt look outside!‚Äù But it was too late.

The boy kept repeating, ‚ÄúOH NO, OH NO, OH NO‚Ä¶‚Äù Then finally a scream from the young girl rang out as the line cut off. My mouth hung open, and a lump swelled in my throat.

*What am I even doing?* The thought came to me but before I had time to process it, the red light started to flash. I clicked in the next caller.

My voice trembled, ‚ÄúH-Hi, this is Steve‚Ä¶ What is your name and where are you?‚Äù

A man's voice came across the line.

‚ÄúHey Steve, I‚Äôm Ben, a long-time listener and first-time caller!‚Äù Ben chuckled to himself, ‚ÄúI thought Halloween was over? I loved your guys‚Äô special a couple of weeks ago, but I didn‚Äôt know you would keep the immersion going this long! Great stuff guys, keep it up!‚Äù

Panic rose in me, ‚ÄúNo wait, listen! This is *real*, you need to leave the city! Where are you at?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm in Bothell and hey, I am a *huge* fan, hell my kids will love to listen to the playback of this! I‚Äôm actually listening in on my phone about to head out the door for work, and this is seriously great stuff guys-‚Äù

The headset picked up a door squeaking on its hinges. *He‚Äôs leaving the house!* I cut him off mid-sentence.

‚ÄúListen to me motherfucker, close your door and pack your things. You and your family need to get out of town! This is not a fucking bit!‚Äù

‚ÄúWoah, woah hey, easy there Steve I know‚Ä¶‚Äù His voice trailed off, ¬†‚ÄúMy neighbor is here‚Ä¶ hang on.‚Äù His line then muffled as he took the phone away from his face, ‚ÄúBill, it's too early for yard work. What‚Äôre you doin‚Äô pal? Guess what? I'm on the radio right now! What are you lookin‚Äô at anyway?‚Äù

I slammed my desk in frustration, ‚ÄúGod dammit no!‚Äù. The line cut out once again.

Staring up at the booth look met my gaze before putting his head in his hands. I couldn‚Äôt hear him, but I knew he was sobbing. The red light flashed, and I clicked in the next caller.

With newfound determination, I thought to myself that I wouldn‚Äôt -no, *couldn‚Äôt -* let anyone else die.

‚ÄúHi, this is Steve! You need to listen to me! Do not look in the sky outside, pack what you can and leave town!‚Äù

A familiar voice came through.

‚ÄúSteve this is Bella, I can‚Äôt reach your cell, what‚Äôs going on? I have been listening all morning, I won‚Äôt look outside. My mom and dad are awake too, but I haven‚Äôt seen them since they told me to pack my things. My door‚Äôs closed but I think I can hear them talking‚Ä¶ or chanting something out in the living room? I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù

My niece, sister, and brother-in-law lived only a few miles from the studio. My stomach sank at the thought of something happening to them, this was my chance; I might still be able to save them.

‚ÄúListen Bell, I‚Äôm here. Just focus on my voice. Deep breaths.‚Äù

My niece let in and out three long breaths. The tenseness in my shoulder momentarily relaxed, and I was relieved my niece was all right, but I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if my sister and brother-in-law were okay too.

‚ÄúGood girl, now you‚Äôre gonna have to help me out here hon. Don‚Äôt look outside any windows, but I need you to crack the door and see what‚Äôs going on in the living room. Can you do that for me?

Her voice trembled, ‚ÄúY-yes, yes I can do that.‚Äù. A twist of a doorknob could be heard as Bella cracked her bedroom door into the living room. The chanting she described was now clearly audible.

‚ÄúWe will serve. We will serve. We will serve.‚Äù A man and woman‚Äôs voice kept repeating the same phrase over and over.

Bella spoke out, ‚ÄúMom... dad?

I could feel the building shake and looked up from my stupor. Luke was looking nervously toward the windows. Flipping one side of my headset off, I heard the building creak and moan on its old frame. I stared precariously at the vibrating windows Luke‚Äôs attention was on. The vibration of the glass would surely shatter them soon.

‚ÄúWe will serve!‚Äù The chant ‚Äì now a shout ‚Äì ripped my attention back to the headset.

‚ÄúListen, Bella, is that your mom and dad?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, they are looking at me, but they won't respond to anything I say. They just keep saying the same thing.‚Äù The chant grew louder, ‚ÄúThey are walking right at me!‚Äù, she exclaimed.

‚ÄúBella close the door!‚Äù A bang of a door came through clearly, muffling my sister and brother-in-law‚Äôs voices. The studio windows finally gave in. Glass shattered inward and heavy winds began flinging loose items around the small room. A piece of glass gashed my already bloody cheek, and I shrank my face away from that side of the room as the blinds lifted from gusts of air.

Shielding my eyes, I chanced a glance at the production booth. Luke stood dead straight looking directly out the window. His eyes grew wide and instantly bloodshot, blood began to streak slowly from his tear ducts and ears. Luke then began mouthing something in the booth to himself.

*We will serve*

The building groaned and began to wane, the old brick building and wooden floor started to crumble around me. I held onto the fixed table bolted to the ground as the leather chair began to roll away on the shifting floor. With one firm grip on the table and another on my headset, I cried out to my niece.

‚ÄúBella, can you still hear me!? Bella, you need to get out of the house and leave the city! Get in your car and leave!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Uncle Steve I know! I just don‚Äôt know *how* to leave! I can barely hear you, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù A banging was coming from Bella‚Äôs phone. ‚ÄúOh god, I think they are at the door. They are trying to break the door down!‚Äù

‚ÄúBella listen to me, climb out your window! Hell, break it open! Go now!‚Äù The building began tilting in an awkward direction as the earth below shook the foundations. I was losing my grip on the edge of the table. My chair swiveled and was now facing the busted-out studio windows. My arm fully outstretched grasped the table as I hung on for dear life. As the window shades flapped up and down, the winged beast went in and out of sight. The beast had made its way past the Olympic Mountain range which lay burning in the distance and was now directly over Puget Sound. The large body completely filled the horizon as far as I could see in each direction, cracks in the earth swallowed whole city blocks. Tendrils trailed down from the beast not only from its face but from all over its body, rolling down to the writhing ocean surface. The slow flap of its massive, hooked wings surged down, causing massive tsunami-sized swells to form off the Seattle coastline. Water began surging into the city, whole skyscrapers fell from the converging ocean and wind.

It was here.

I could no longer look away as its red eyes beamed at me. Each time the eyes revealed with the flap up of the shade, I could feel my corneas flash cook from its leer.

A loud crack and bang came over the headset. Bella screamed; glass shattered as a window was smashed on the other end of the line. Chants came over through the headset, ‚ÄúWe will serve!‚Äù

Bella cried out ‚ÄúUncle Steve!‚Äù as the headset slipped off my head and out of my grip. The tilt of the floor finally pulled the chair out from under me, and I thrust my free arm up to the table, still managing to hold on. The blinds flew off the window frame and now I could fully see the beast‚Äôs eyes uninterrupted emanating in the dark sky. ¬†

Had my niece escaped? Was it too late?

‚ÄúBella‚Ä¶Bella‚Ä¶‚Äù I could only manage to murmur as I felt the beast‚Äôs hunger fill my very soul.

The beast bellowed out as it crossed the coastline into the crumbling city. The noise from the beast burst my eardrums, and I felt the trickle of blood run at the side of my face as the unnatural guttural language came from the winged horror.

‚Äú***AHNYTH CTHULU***‚Äù

My eyes were set ablaze and engulfed in the red ire of the tendril-filled face. Its eyes sank directly into my frontal cortex. I screamed out as I let go of the table.

and this: https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/s/tcewuRM1zo

So my (39/M/INTJ) date with the most wonderful ISFJ (35/F) in my life date happened last week. First, thank you all who gave your input into date ideas, and for the input into decoding ISFJs. They were really helpful, and I analyzed them in depth as only an INTJ would. I took most of the advice, but also diverted far from it in other cases. Overall, my goal and intent was to make her feel like the center of the universe for the day, regardless of how things turned out in the end.

Ahead of time, I told her that I made reservations at a nice restaurant that specializes in the food she likes. She didn't know where, but I knew what her favorite food was and sprung for Michelin star. I also made sure that the restaurant knew that it was her birthday ahead of time, and it was a very important birthday. I called them at least 3 times before, and they assured me that they'd make sure it would be the best birthday dinner ever. They did a solid and pulled out the stops, and she really appreciated it.

With her knowing that dinner was already set up, I asked her when she'd like me to pick her up, so she could sort of dictate how long we'd hang out till dinner. She wanted to meet in the morning, so I guess she wanted to hang out the whole day which was a positive sign. The entire date from start to finish lasted just a little under 12 hours.

It was cold outside, so I picked her up with her favorite coffee in hand. I know she likes jewelry and her preferred brands, and sort of preferences, and was planning on getting her jewelry for her birthday. But my fashion sense sucks, so I told her that I wanted to get her a piece of jewelry but wanted to make sure that it was something she liked. So that's the date started with walking around looking for what she liked. I was able to tell the store person some of the properties of jewelry she likes, which she found impressive. She finally chose something, I got it, and she put it on and said that she'd wear it every day and think of me (which was exactly my nefarious INTJ plan).

We then went to a relatively casual place around the corner for a small lunch, and talked about various things and got into some pretty deep conversation while at it. We entered into discussing some of the less not so fun stuff about life, family issues, etc., which was different in tone from our usual lighthearted banter. She also said she usually spends her birthday alone, and today was special to her because she's actually spending it with someone.

A museum was having an exhibit about something she was really interested in. So that was the next stop on the itinerary. I actually got tickets at 3 different museums the day before (I have annual membership so there wasn't any additional cost). Took a look at the exhibits, took a lot of pictures, then went to the museum caf√© to have coffee and chat more. One of the things that stood out was that we talked about how both of us have jobs that require us to deal with a lot of people, and that doing the job is draining (the shared ""I"" in both of us), and that we usually need to be alone to recharge - but she said that she always feels recharged with me, and even when we met for work it didn't drain her. I told her I felt the same way. We talked until the museum closed; then continued our conversation while taking an evening walk in the park, eventually just sitting on a park bench. 

Took a taxi down to the restaurant where reservations were made. Restaurant was throughly briefed by me before hand. A lot of the input in the date question said casual, so I approached this with caution. I actually made reservations at 4 different places, all of which had her favorite food, before finally deciding to take a risk on this one since it was the best rated places, and I wanted perfection. Cancelled the other 3 reservations once I felt confident this was the right choice. The staff made sure that her birthday would be as impactful as if someone was going to propose. In fact, at one point even I almost thought the staff got mixed up and thought this was a proposal. Definitely exceeded expectations and made her feel special.

Somewhere along the line, I secretly slipped a happy birthday card and another small gift into her bag. The small gift was something I thought would be helpful to her knowing how she is, and had a hand written gift tag to it stating as much. The card had a handwritten note, which I drafted and revised at least a dozen times, and which stopped short of a direct profession of love, but I think sufficiently conveyed my feelings (although I did sign off with the words ""with love"" so that was at least hinted).

We started the date linking arms, and by the walk in the park were holding hands with fingers entwined. A few times during the date, she sent photos to her closest female friend, who was texting back how she was jealous and that she needed to come to our state and find a boyfriend here. Ended the date with a kiss. When she got home, she sent me text with a photo of the gift, said she read the card and thanked me for the happiest birthday ever. Since then, she's sent a note asking when she can come by my place to try my cooking, and we've already set a date. It will be the first time one of us will be in another's homes.

Overall, I think this is pretty close as it gets to being girlfriend-boyfriend, without it actually being formally said. So I'm calling this a successful mission and taking this as a win. Thank you ISFJ collective for helping to make this possible!",4,1731360662.0,isfj,0,1.0,False

On Wednesday, Pam Gilmore stopped by Queen City Chevrolet.¬† She admitted to Jim that her first stop was Faulkner Motors.¬† Pam said, ‚ÄúI did find a couple cars that I found some interest in.¬† But I told your father and half-sister I would see what you had and if I didn‚Äôt find anything here, I would go back to Faulkner Motors.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you did.¬† I think I may have something that may suit your fancy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, Jim.¬† I‚Äôm just happy to get my insurance check.¬† Also, I got a call from the police last night.¬† They found the two who stole my car.¬† They‚Äôre in custody now.‚Äù

‚ÄúPam, are you planning on pressing charges?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† I just might.¬† They did leave me without a car.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Pam.¬† I got to check on something for a minute.¬† Why don‚Äôt you walk around the lot and see what you might like?¬† I‚Äôll be out there shortly.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Jim.¬† Do what you need to do.‚Äù

While Pam walked around the lot, Jim checked on some paperwork.¬† Mark stepped into the office.¬† He said to Jim, ‚ÄúI see Pam Gilmore showed up.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúYes, she did.‚Äù

‚ÄúThink she‚Äôll find something here?‚Äù Mark asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure she will.¬† I‚Äôll check on her after I finish this paperwork.‚Äù

‚ÄúJim, I‚Äôm not doing anything right now if you‚Äôd like me to take care of her.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Mark.¬† That‚Äôll be okay, if you‚Äôre not too busy.‚Äù

Jim and Mark walked out to the lot together.¬† Right away, Pam found a car she thought she would probably like.¬† Jim and Mark both walked with Pam to look at the car.¬† Jim asked her, ‚ÄúYou think you might like that one?‚Äù

Pam said, ‚ÄúSure, Jim.¬† It does look sharp.‚Äù

Indeed, it did look sharp.¬† It was a dark gray 2003 Nissan 350Z.¬† Pam got a look at the sticker.¬† She asked Jim, ‚ÄúIs that the price, eleven thousand?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Pam.¬† We just got that car last Friday.¬† The fellow traded it in on a new Chevy Volt, an electric car.¬† Can you believe that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† But I don‚Äôt think an electric car would be something I‚Äôd like.¬† I understand the plug-ins are quite complicated.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, Pam.¬† I do sell one here and there.‚Äù

Then Mark looked at a couple checking out a new truck, a Chevrolet Colorado.¬† Mark said, ‚ÄúJim, if you would like to take care of Pam, I‚Äôll be glad to help that couple checking out that new truck.‚Äù

Jim said with some excitement, ‚ÄúSure, Mark.¬† Go on ahead.‚Äù

Pam said, ‚ÄúJim, you guys sure do get excited when you have customers.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúYes, Pam.¬† Even more so when we sell a vehicle.‚Äù

Just before Mark made his way to that couple, he said, ‚ÄúYou got to in this business.‚Äù

Mark walked to the couple looking at the truck.¬† Pam looked around the Nissan some more.¬† Jim said, ‚ÄúPam, that is one good looking car.¬† Would you like to take it for a test drive?‚Äù

Pam answered, ‚ÄúSure, Jim.¬† I think this looks like a car I might like.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Pam.¬† Let me go inside and get the keys and a dealer tag.‚Äù

Jim went to his office.¬† When he got there, his cell phone was ringing.¬† It was Paulina.¬† Jim answered it.¬† He said, ‚ÄúHi, Paulina.¬† What‚Äôs up?‚Äù

Paulina said, ‚ÄúHi, Jim.¬† I just wanted to call you and see if Mom‚Äôs there.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Paulina.¬† As a matter of fact, we‚Äôre about to go on a test drive.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Jim.¬† What kind of car is she checking out?‚Äù

‚ÄúA 2003 Nissan 350Z.¬† A dark gray one.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Jim.¬† But please don‚Äôt let Mom buy something outrageous.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by outrageous?‚Äù

Paulina said, ‚ÄúJim, I know you sell expensive cars like BMW and Mercedes.¬† And of course, being a Chevy dealer, you sell Camaros and Corvettes.¬† Mom‚Äôs budget is quite limited, and I don‚Äôt want her getting anything she can‚Äôt handle.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúPaulina, don‚Äôt worry.¬† I know she‚Äôll pick out something she‚Äôll be happy with.¬† And if she‚Äôs happy, then I‚Äôm happy as well because I sold her a car.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Jim.¬† Thank you.¬† I appreciate it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Paulina.¬† I got the keys and the dealer tag.¬† I‚Äôm about to take your mother on that test drive.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Jim.¬† I‚Äôll talk to you later.‚Äù

Jim returned from his office with the keys to the Nissan along with the dealer tag.¬† Jim unlocked the car, and he asked Pam to get into the driver‚Äôs seat.¬† Right away, Pam started up the car.¬† Jim showed her how to operate the heater (it was near the end of November, so no need for the air conditioning right now).¬† Then he showed her how to operate the radio (which was now set to one of Charlotte‚Äôs soft rock stations which was already playing Christmas songs).¬† Pam seemed a little uncomfortable, so Jim showed her how to adjust the seat.¬† Pam was now ready to check out the car, so Jim made his way to the passenger seat.¬† He looked at the fuel gauge, and he said, ‚ÄúPam, I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre a little low on gas.¬† So, we‚Äôll stop by a gas station on our test drive route.‚Äù

Taking his usual test drive route, Jim showed her where to go.¬† Before going onto Interstate 77, Jim asked Pam to stop at a convenience store on Clanton Road.¬† Pam offered to pay for the gas, but Jim said he would.¬† Jim pumped the gas, and then they were back on the test drive.¬†

Pam drove on I-77 to the exit for John Belk Freeway.¬† After they got back to Queen City Chevrolet, Pam decided she wanted the car.¬† Jim had Pam come to his office to do the necessary paperwork.¬† In the office, Pam had a question for Jim.¬† ‚ÄúJim, how are you and Sydney‚Äôs wedding plans coming along?‚Äù ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†¬†

Jim said, ‚ÄúPam, we haven‚Äôt got that far yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† I know it‚Äôs only been a few weeks.¬† But I was wanting you and Sydney to know that I will be more than happy to help in any way I can.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, Pam.¬† I‚Äôll let Sydney know.‚Äù

Jim showed Pam the papers she had to sign to obtain the Nissan.¬† Jim also gave Pam a temporary tag.¬† He said to her, ‚ÄúPam, me or someone with Queen City Chevrolet will contact you when your new tag comes in.¬† Just come to the dealership and pick it up.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Jim.¬† I will.¬† And remember what I said about your wedding planning.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Pam.¬† I will.¬† And I will tell Sydney as well.‚Äù

Jim handed Pam the key to her new car.¬† Pam used the restroom, and she was gone in a few short minutes.¬† Jim returned to his office.¬† He smiled for about five minutes, probably because he had the satisfaction of selling a car to someone he knew since he was a teenager.¬† If he sold a vehicle to someone he didn‚Äôt know, he wouldn‚Äôt feel any less satisfied.¬† He knew he couldn‚Äôt feel that way, not in this business.¬† Jim also knew he would never be happy in this business if did not sell a vehicle.¬† And neither did anyone else at Queen City Chevrolet.



üòä

¬†

Later that afternoon, Jim had not one visitor at the dealership‚Ä¶but three!¬† Russell, Scout and Paulina all showed up in Jim‚Äôs office.¬† They did not look happy.¬† But they did not look upset, either.¬† Russell said, ‚ÄúJim, our sister called us on our jobs.¬† I understand you sold Mom a car.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúYes, Russell.¬† I did.¬† A dark gray 2003 Nissan 350Z.‚Äù¬†¬†

Then Scout said, ‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† I saw it quite a lot as I passed your dealership.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúWe went on a test drive.¬† She seemed to like it.¬† And she did buy it.‚Äù

Then Russell said, ‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† We‚Äôre glad Mom‚Äôs happy.¬† She didn‚Äôt do anything stupid during the test drive, didn‚Äôt she?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by that?‚Äù Jim asked.

Scout asked, ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt become a speed demon, didn‚Äôt she?‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúNo, she didn‚Äôt.¬† In fact, she stayed well within the speed limit.‚Äù

Russell said, ‚ÄúOkay.¬† That‚Äôs good.¬† Mom does tend to have a lead foot at times.‚Äù

Then Paulina said, ‚ÄúI remember one time when I was about six or seven when Mom drove us down to Knoxville.¬† We went to a wedding for one of our distant relatives.¬† We had that Oldsmobile station wagon Mom moved us to Charlotte in.¬† Mom must have done at least eighty miles an hour all the way to Knoxville.‚Äù

Russell added, ‚ÄúAnd she nearly killed us more than a couple times on that trip.‚Äù

Scout said, ‚ÄúGuys, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs a memory that needs to be forgotten.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúOkay, you three.¬† I know your mother.¬† I also know she‚Äôs a good driver.¬† She‚Äôs happy with her new car.¬† If she‚Äôs happy, then I‚Äôm happy.‚Äù

Paulina said, ‚ÄúOkay, Jim.¬† That‚Äôs all we needed to know.‚Äù

Then Russell said, ‚ÄúYeah, Jim.¬† Thanks for selling our mother a car.‚Äù

Then Scout said, ‚ÄúJim, we just want to make sure Mom‚Äôs happy.‚Äù

Jim got up from his chair, and he said to them, ‚ÄúLook, you three.¬† I can see you three are overprotective of your mother.¬† But trust me, I don‚Äôt wish to sell her or anyone else a vehicle they would not be safe in.‚Äù

Scout said, ‚ÄúJim, we know you wouldn‚Äôt.¬† All we wanted to do is come by and thank you for selling Mom a car she can be happy driving.¬† We‚Äôre also happy she bought a car from someone she‚Äôs known for a long time and can trust.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am just as overprotective of my five daughters, maybe even more so.¬† Chelsea already has her own car, and I know it‚Äôs safe for her.¬† When the time comes when my other girls plan to buy their own cars, I want them to feel safe as well.‚Äù

Russell, Scout and Paulina all agreed with Jim.¬† With that, the three left Jim‚Äôs office.¬† The rest of that afternoon was a quiet one.¬† Mark, Simon and Jonathan all left the dealership around six.¬† After they left, Jim spent the next half hour going through some paperwork.¬† After he got done with his paperwork, Zoe showed up at the dealership.¬† She was dressed very pretty, in a gray suit with a burgundy blouse with a lot of ruffles, tan pantyhose and black high-heeled shoes.¬† Jim asked her to step into his office.¬† Zoe sat down, smoothing her skirt in the process.¬† Jim asked Zoe if she wanted to have a cup of coffee or a can of soda.¬† Zoe asked Jim if he had any diet sodas.¬† Jim said he had Diet Coke in the vending machine.¬† Jim went to get a can of Diet Coke for Zoe and a can of Coke for himself.¬† He was back in his office in less than two minutes.

Jim asked Zoe what brought her to Queen City Chevrolet.¬† Zoe said, ‚ÄúI understand from Paulina that you sold her mother a car today.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúYes, I did.¬† Word does get around fast, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† I guess it does.‚Äù

Right away, Jim noticed something different about Zoe.¬† Her long brunette hair was a lot wavier than it had been.¬† Jim said to her, ‚ÄúYour hair looks beautiful.‚Äù

Zoe smiled and played with her hair as she said, ‚ÄúWhy, thank you, Jim.¬† I felt it was time for a change.‚Äù

Jim smiled back at Zoe.¬† He said to her, ‚ÄúI guess there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.¬† Someone once told me that change can be a good thing.‚Äù

Zoe smiled back at Jim and asked him, ‚ÄúWhat kind of car did you sell Pam?‚Äù

‚ÄúA dark gray 2003 Nissan 350Z.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúJim, I saw that car many times as I passed here.‚Äù

‚ÄúPam and I took it out for a test drive.¬† She made up her mind very quickly.¬† It was the car she wanted.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good.¬† I can see why Russell, Scout and Paulina all stopped by your car dealership.¬† Try to remember this.¬† Pam is my aunt, my mother‚Äôs sister.¬† That makes Russell, Scout and Paulina my cousins.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Zoe.¬† I remember that well.¬† But we are still friends, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† We most certainly are.‚Äù

Then, it hit Jim.¬† That summer evening in 1984.¬† The one when Jim and his friends made that special promise to remain friends forever, no matter what.¬† Of course, Zoe and her siblings were not there because they did not arrive in Charlotte until later that year.¬† Not only that, Toni Holbrook and Jeremy Barrett had both just been born, so they were not there, either.¬† Toni and Jeremy and the Marlowe bunch would be added to that promise later.¬† Jim realized something else.¬† It had been a long time since they had been to that house in Lansing.¬† It had also been a long time since they remade that promise.¬† *Both are long overdue*, Jim thought.

Jim said, ‚ÄúSome of the guys and I are planning a fishing trip to the mountains this spring.¬† Maybe we‚Äôll stop by that house in Lansing.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds good,‚Äù Zoe said.

‚ÄúYes.¬† I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing what the place looks like now.‚Äù

Then, the question nearly everyone had been asking Jim‚Ä¶came up again!¬† Zoe asked him, ‚ÄúJim, how are the wedding plans coming along?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be starting them soon.¬† Sydney and I were talking about having the same kind of wedding Candi and I had.¬† A backyard one with palm trees and bridesmaids wearing different colored dresses.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† I see.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you remember.¬† You were at that wedding, weren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† Me and my bunch went back to Johnson City after the wedding.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Zoe.¬† Now I remember.‚Äù

‚ÄúI also remember seeing how April Lynn and Sydney both looked at you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes.¬† I remember.¬† I also remember they had a crush on me.‚Äù

Zoe looked down, took in a deep breath, let it out slowly, and then she said, ‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† And at the time, I knew exactly how they felt.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù Jim asked Zoe.

Zoe paused for a moment, and then she said, ‚ÄúJim, I‚Äôve been keeping a secret for some time.¬† April Lynn and Sydney were not by themselves.¬† I had a crush on you also.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Zoe.¬† I also understand Allison also had a crush on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† She did.¬† She told me that more than once.‚Äù

‚ÄúZoe, nearly every girl in the neighborhood had a crush on me.¬† Even when I started dating Candi, we still stayed friends.‚Äù

That was when Zoe looked at her watch.¬† ‚ÄúOh, Jim.¬† Look at the time.¬† I know you‚Äôve got to get home to your girls.¬† I enjoyed this conversation.‚Äù

‚ÄúZoe, so did I.¬† We‚Äôve got to do it again.‚Äù

Jim and Zoe both got up.¬† He walked her to the door.¬† She started to give him a kiss on his cheek, but something made her think better of it.¬† Maybe it was Sydney.¬† She was Zoe‚Äôs friend, too.¬† So instead, she just gave Jim a hug.¬† After Zoe left, Jim set the alarm system, and he locked up the place.¬† Jim called the house.¬† Chelsea answered the phone.¬† He wanted to speak to Sydney.¬† Chelsea said she spoke to Sydney a few minutes ago.¬† Chelsea said that Sydney was still at her office and would not be home for a while.¬† Chelsea also said she offered to get her sisters sandwiches from Subway.¬† Chelsea said she got Jim a sandwich, a rotisserie chicken with cheese, every vegetable (except olives), mayonnaise and mustard, and seasoned with parmesan cheese, oregano, salt and pepper.¬†

Jim drove around Charlotte some.¬† He stopped at a thrift shop on Freedom Drive.¬† He found him some die-cast metal cars from Matchbox and Hot Wheels from the eighties.¬† He also bought him three dress shirts.¬† Dark blue, orange and lavender.¬† He also bought a pair of suspenders and two pairs of dress pants, black and tan.¬† *I just may be the best dressed man at the dealership and the church and the neighborhood*, Jim thought.

After the thrift shop, Jim stopped at the Kmart, which was across the street.¬† A few days ago, he heard on the news that the store would be closing within the next three months.¬† When Jim stepped into the store, he saw no sign of it.¬† In fact, the store looked like it was still running business as usual.¬† Jim did not buy much from the Kmart, just a light bulb for the lamp in the living room, a pack of Juicy Fruit gum and a can of Monster Energy for in the morning (he started drinking a can a day).¬†

When Jim stepped out to his Cadillac Escalade, he got a look at the Charlotte skyline.¬† The parking lot of the Kmart on Freedom Drive had a great view of the skyline.¬† It was now dark, and the skyline was beautifully lit up.¬† Jim remembered seeing the skyline from the parking lot many times.¬† In those earlier years, the Charlotte skyline was not as built up as it was now.¬† It only had a few skyscrapers back then.¬† Now, it had many more.¬† Jim looked at the skyline for about a couple minutes, and then he got back in the Escalade and got back onto Freedom Drive.

Jim stopped at a convenience store on Freedom Drive to get gas and a bottle of Mountain Dew, a Slim Jim and a bag of cheddar cheese Sun Chips, and then he headed for home.

¬†

üòä

¬†

It was just a little past eight o‚Äô clock when Jim got home.¬† Jim drank his bottle of Mountain Dew and ate his Sun Chips and Slim Jim on his way home.¬† He parked the Escalade in the usual spot.¬† The garage door was not open, so Jim had no idea if Sydney was home.¬† He put the empty bottle and bag in the trash can at the curb, and then he made his way inside.¬† His daughters were at the table, eating their sandwiches from Subway.¬† Lauren gave Jim his sandwich.¬† She also had a small bag of potato chips.¬† Jim thanked Chelsea for the sandwich.¬† Jim did not ask the girls if Sydney was home.¬† He just made him a glass of iced tea, and then he sat down and ate.¬† All five girls went upstairs and got ready for bed.¬† Jim worked hard on his sandwich and chips.¬† As he ate, he checked his cell phone for messages.¬† There was one text message.¬† It was from Pam.¬† She just wanted to thank Jim for selling her the Nissan.¬† She also said that she knew about her three kids and Zoe seeing Jim at the dealership.¬† Jim texted her back and told her how happy he was that she decided to buy a car from him.¬† He also told her that he enjoyed the visit from her kids, and from Zoe as well.

Jim was so full that he became sleepy.¬† He emptied his bag from the thrift shop.¬† He put his clothes together to take to the cleaners in the morning.¬† He hung the suspenders on a hanger in the closet.¬† He took a pair of pajama pants and an old T-shirt out of the closet, and a pair of boxer shorts out of one of the drawers (Jim always preferred boxer shorts).¬† He got ready to take a bath.¬† *I may take a bubble bath*, he thought.¬† Jim started to go into the bathroom, but he was stopped by a familiar voice.¬† ‚ÄúJim, is that you I hear?‚Äù

Sydney Cavanaugh.¬† *She must have got home before I did*, Jim thought.¬† Jim did say, ‚ÄúYes, Sydney.¬† It‚Äôs me.¬† I just got through eating.‚Äù

The bathroom door was open, and the light was on.¬† Jim looked inside to see Sydney in the bathtub.¬† She was resting her chin on the side of the bathtub.¬† Her hair was ponytailed into a bun.¬† She asked Jim, ‚ÄúHow was your sandwich?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was pretty good.¬† It was made just the way I like it.‚Äù¬† ¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúMine was, too.¬† I got ham and cheese with every vegetable except olives.¬† They don‚Äôt really agree with my stomach.‚Äù

‚ÄúI always get my sandwiches without olives.‚Äù

Sydney just smiled and nodded.¬† Jim saw there were bubbles in the bathtub.¬† He tried his best not to look at Sydney‚Äôs bare body in the tub.¬† She smiled and said, ‚ÄúOh, I guess you‚Äôre wondering about the bubbles.¬† I hope you don‚Äôt mind, but I found your ocean scented bubble bath and put some in the bath.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, no.¬† I don‚Äôt mind one bit.¬† As a matter of fact, I was thinking about taking a bubble bath myself.¬† The ocean scented bubble bath does help me relax.‚Äù

‚ÄúHard day, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but it was okay.‚Äù

Sydney knew that Jim was trying not to look at her bare body.¬† She said, ‚ÄúJim, it‚Äôs okay.¬† We are engaged.¬† Remember?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.¬† No way I can forget something like that.‚Äù

Jim turned around and started out of the bathroom.¬† But Sydney stopped him.¬† She said, ‚ÄúJim, turn around and look at me.¬† Please?‚Äù

Jim slowly turned around, and he faced Sydney.¬† She asked him, ‚ÄúJim, do you suppose you could wash my back?‚Äù

Jim just stood there.¬† He seemed dumbfounded.¬† He asked, ‚ÄúCome again?‚Äù

Sydney asked him once more, ‚ÄúCould you please wash my back?‚Äù

Jim finally answered, ‚ÄúI suppose I could.‚Äù

Jim told Sydney to turn around.¬† She didn‚Äôt.¬† He started to grab the washcloth, which was draped on the side of the bathtub.¬† Sydney quickly grabbed his hand.¬† She gazed her eyes at him, and she said, ‚ÄúJim, I was wondering if you would join me in the tub.‚Äù

Once again, Jim was speechless.¬† He thought about it for a moment.¬† When Jim and Candi were dating, they made an agreement to save themselves for marriage.¬† Not once while they were dating did Jim and Candi take baths or showers together.¬† Now, here he was, about thirty years later.¬† Sydney was asking Jim to take a bath with her.¬† After some hesitation, Jim finally said, ‚ÄúOkay, Sydney.¬† I suppose I could.‚Äù

Jim quickly went into the bedroom and he said, ‚ÄúHold on, Sydney.¬† I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù

Just as quickly, Jim ran downstairs to the kitchen.¬† He grabbed two cans of Coke.¬† He was back in the bedroom in less than a minute.

Jim turned on the stereo.¬† It was set to a soft rock station.¬† The station was finishing up the news.¬† He put the two cans of Coke on the bathroom sink.¬† While the DJ was giving the weather for the Charlotte area, Jim undressed himself.¬† He faced away from Sydney.¬† He did not know that Sydney was looking.¬† Right now, he didn‚Äôt really care.¬† Jim could feel a lump in his throat.¬† It felt like it was the size of a tomato.¬† The lump soon felt like it was going down into his stomach.¬† After he got done, he slowly walked to the bathtub.¬† He was still wearing his boxers.¬† Sydney softly said, ‚ÄúJim, it‚Äôs okay.¬† We‚Äôre going to be a married couple soon.¬† We need to get used to it.‚Äù

Jim turned around, sat down on the edge of the bathtub, and he removed his boxers.¬† As quick as he could, he slid down into the bathtub, making a splash in the process.¬† Sydney said, ‚ÄúJim, be careful.¬† I hope you didn‚Äôt get hurt.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt.¬† Nothing broken.‚Äù

Jim sat behind Sydney.¬† By that time, music was playing again.¬† Air Supply.¬† *Lost in Love*.¬† Jim and Sydney felt the song set the mood perfectly.¬† For a few minutes, Jim and Sydney did not say a word.¬† They just sat there, listening to Air Supply.¬† Just as the song was ending, Sydney finally said, ‚ÄúJim, I was hoping for this moment.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean us sharing the bathtub together?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† That.‚Äù

‚ÄúCandi and I never did this until we were married.¬† Maybe you could see why I was so hesitant about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúJim, there‚Äôs nothing to be nervous about.¬† We need to get used to it.‚Äù

The soft rock station must have been in an eighties soft rock mood this evening.¬† The next song the station played was a song from a singer named Chris Christian.¬† *I Want You, I Need You*.¬† It was from 1981, the year Jim had to repeat the sixth grade at Dilworth Elementary School, much as he did not want to.¬† That was because of health problems (appendicitis) and some academic issues.¬† It was a memory Jim would just as soon forget, but he couldn‚Äôt.

Sydney was still waiting for what she asked Jim for.¬† She said, ‚ÄúJim, you did say you would wash my back.‚Äù

Jim grabbed a washcloth, put some liquid soap on it, and then he gently scrubbed her back.¬† Jim asked Sydney if she would be willing to wash his back.¬† She agreed.¬† After she washed his back, she put her head on his shoulder.¬† She softly kissed him on his cheek.¬† He rubbed her arm gently.¬† Many warm and fuzzy feelings were running through Jim‚Äôs mind.¬† That had not happened to Jim in some time.¬† Sydney ran her fingers through his hair as she asked him, ‚ÄúFunny feelings, sweetheart?‚Äù

‚ÄúI suppose so.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay.¬† I‚Äôm having those feelings, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo they seem warm and fuzzy?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† I think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly how I‚Äôm feeling.‚Äù

Then Sydney said, ‚ÄúJim, please look at me.‚Äù

Jim was not sure how he would react to seeing Sydney‚Äôs unclothed body.¬† At the same time, he was not sure how she would react to seeing him naked.¬† Jim thought, *Okay, it‚Äôs now or never*.¬† Jim slowly turned around, and he was soon facing Sydney.¬† She was looking at him, smiling, and gazing her eyes at him.¬† They were checking each other out.¬† After Sydney was done checking out Jim, she softly took his face in her hands, and she softly kissed him on the lips.¬† At that moment, one major thought ran through Jim‚Äôs mind.¬† Driving his Impala convertible on an open highway at a fast speed, top down, radio blasting, a can of Coke close by.¬† Sydney had a thought running through her mind as well.¬† It wasn‚Äôt anything like Jim‚Äôs.¬† She was in a wedding dress, her wedding day, kissing Jim.¬† Before long, the thoughts were over.¬† They found themselves back in the bathtub, kissing each other.

They got out of the tub and dried themselves off.¬† Jim thought, *Okay.¬† What did we just do?*

Another thought went through Jim‚Äôs mind.¬† *Okay, Jim.¬† Here‚Äôs what you did.¬† Sydney wanted you to share the bathtub with her.¬† She loves you a lot.¬† You and Sydney have been friends since childhood.¬† She had a crush on you all that time.¬† For the past six years since Candi died, you did everything you could to avoid getting involved with anyone.¬† You always said you wouldn‚Äôt become romantically involved with a woman unless she was willing to accept your daughters.¬† Well, guess what?¬† Sydney has found someone she wanted to become romantically involved with.¬† YOU!¬† And she accepts your daughters.¬† You just asked Sydney to marry you, and she said yes.¬† Now, it‚Äôs time to pick yourself up, brush yourself off, and get back to the business of living.¬† You have nothing to worry about now.¬† There‚Äôs nothing holding you back.*

Jim put on his boxers, pajama pants and an old T-shirt, a plain gray one.¬† He did that in the closet.¬† As soon as he stepped out of the closet, he saw Sydney in the skimpiest female pajamas he had ever seen‚Ä¶and the sexiest!¬† It just barely went down her legs.¬† Jim wanted to ask Sydney if she was wearing anything underneath, but he didn‚Äôt.¬† She just smiled and played with her hair.¬† Jim turned the covers on the bed, and he told Sydney to get in.¬† Sydney sat down, put her legs together, and then she took both of Jim‚Äôs hands.¬† After the two kissed each other, Jim made his way to his side of the bed.¬† Jim turned off the lamp, and the two drifted off to sleep.¬† There was a full moon out tonight.¬† The light from the moon shined through the blinds, making everything look beautiful.¬† Jim lied on his back through the night.¬† Sydney lied on her side, right up against Jim, with her arm around him.¬† Jim had his arm around Sydney.¬† He had his nose in her hair, smelling of the shampoo she washed her hair with.¬† Jim had no idea what it was, but it smelled like oranges.¬† Even with that, Jim still slept through the night, and so did Sydney.¬† Through the night, Jim had the clock radio on, but kept it at a low volume.¬† Love songs played through the night.¬† Some of those songs ended up in Jim‚Äôs dreams.

¬†

üòä

¬†

Jim was the first one up the next morning.¬† He fixed breakfast for the girls.¬† Eggs, bacon and toast.¬† Jim had the girls come downstairs for breakfast.¬† The girls were finished with breakfast and were gone when Sydney stepped into the kitchen.¬† Chelsea left for her college classes and the other girls went to school.¬† Jim asked Sydney if she wanted anything for breakfast, but she said no.¬† She had an important meeting with a client and needed to leave for her office.¬† Jim poured her some coffee in her travel mug.¬† Jim and Sydney hugged and kissed each other.¬† She left for work.¬† Jim had himself one more cup of coffee before he left for work.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

Today was Wednesday, and the day before Thanksgiving.¬† It would be a slow day at Queen City Chevrolet.¬† Each salesperson only managed to sell one vehicle apiece.¬† Jim would have him a light lunch, two tacos and nachos and a Mountain Dew from the nearby Taco Bell.¬†

After he closed the dealership, Jim stopped by the neighborhood Food Lion to get some stuff for Thanksgiving dinner.¬† He already had a turkey thawing out in the refrigerator.¬† He got some canned Mexican corn, dinner rolls and a pumpkin pie.¬†

Sydney was in the kitchen when Jim got home.¬† She got some chicken and some side items from a nearby Church‚Äôs Chicken.¬† The girls were waiting for Jim to come home so that they could have dinner.¬† Everyone talked about how their day went.¬† The girls were now out of school until Monday.¬† Chelsea had to work on Friday for four hours.¬† Jim told everyone how slow today was.¬† He did tell them about selling Pam Gilmore a car earlier in the week.¬†

The girls went to bed early.¬† Sydney stayed up and did some paperwork from her office.¬† Jim read a magazine in bed and he also listened to some music.¬† It was a magazine on wedding planning.¬† He was still reading the magazine when Sydney walked into the bedroom.¬† Sydney said, ‚ÄúJim, I know we agreed on having our wedding in your back yard.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Sydney.¬† I know.¬† I was checking out some of these wedding cakes.¬† They look beautiful and delicious.¬† They may be expensive, but I don‚Äôt know if our mothers would be willing to make a wedding cake from scratch.¬† We may have to go with a cake from the bakery or a supermarket deli.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† I guess you‚Äôre right.‚Äù

The magazine also had honeymoon plans.¬† Sydney saw them and said, ‚ÄúIf cost wasn‚Äôt an issue, I would suggest a cruise to the Bahamas.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, or maybe Daytona Beach, or maybe even the Florida Keys.‚Äù

‚ÄúJim, didn‚Äôt you and Candi take a honeymoon trip to Myrtle Beach.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.¬† We went to Charleston and then to Myrtle Beach.‚Äù

Sydney looked at Jim for a moment.¬† Then she said, ‚ÄúJim, I will be happy with that.¬† I‚Äôll be happy as long as I am with you.‚Äù

Jim smiled and kissed Sydney.¬† Then he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy with Charleston and Myrtle Beach as well.‚Äù

Sydney walked into the bathroom.¬† She brushed her teeth and gargled with mouthwash.¬† Jim laughed as she gargled.¬† Maybe it was because he recently saw a commercial for dog food in which a dog was gargling mouthwash.¬† Jim laughed until he about cried.¬† He did try to keep a straight face as she stepped out of the bathroom.

Jim and Sydney slept through the night.¬† They knew they would need all the rest they could.¬† Tomorrow was Thanksgiving.¬† And they knew it would be a big day.",0,1731360632.0,writers,1,0.33,False

The chilly weather had not blown through since the night before when thunder clouds had rolled into town yesterday evening, and the thunder was still rolling in the early hours of this morning. The only good thing about my 3 o‚Äôclock journey to the station was the lack of traffic, I didn‚Äôt have to sit behind a gridlock and freeze my ass off, I could instead freeze my ass off while driving at 60 mph. Even after 30 years of being the host of *Good Morning Seattle!,* the winter months never got easier. Something about driving home when it was dark and cold, and then driving to work when it was dark and cold was off-putting.

Our station's parking lot stood empty except for a brown 85‚Äô Oldsmobile Cutlass. My new producer's stylish ride had probably gotten there an hour or so before I did, and that would probably last another month or so before the new hire's motivation would wear off from the daily grind. The unmanned front lobby had a pot of coffee already brewed; *someone deserves a raise*, I thought. My boot heels clicked on the tile floor as I made my way to the studio.

The on-air sign hanging near the studio door was unlit as I pushed my way inside the small room. Pulling the cracked black leather roller chair underneath me, I grunted the way all old men do; this would be my home for the next eight hours or so. I reviewed that morning‚Äôs notes I took the day before, going through predicted weather, traffic, upcoming events, and so on. Smooth jazz played faintly from the loose headphones around the microphone boom. We must have a few more songs to go because Luke, our Producer and new hire, was not in the production booth.

While I finished the last of my notes, Luke slipped into the production booth unnoticed. When I looked up our eyes met, and he gave a sheepish wave and motioned me to put the headset on. I swigged the last of my coffee and put on the headset.

""We got a huge lineup of callers this morning, Steve! The phone is ringing off the hook. Something‚Äôs got the morning risers in a stir.""

""Well, they can wait, we got at least two more songs till bingo time! Don't you want to finish your coffee?""

Luke was still filling the shoes of the producer who had just retired, and conversation lately had been a little awkward. He looked at me in a shy way, not wanting to push but clearly something was bothering him.

""I'm serious Steve, there‚Äôs a lot of people calling in today and not the usual‚Äôs either. Maybe the shit weather has got everyone roused this morning or something. Either way, I don‚Äôt think it would be a bad idea to start early.""

I had seen it a million times before. A new hire comes in and thinks they know how to fix everything. Their temporary motivation for their new job creates a wave of wanting to prove themselves. Luke was probably still in his early to mid-twenties, so I understood. He's still got the young energy within him; in some ways I envied him.

I let out a sigh, not in annoyance, but acceptance.

""All right, fine. Let‚Äôs do this thing.""

I swung the microphone in front of me as the last song faded out, and my seriously dated intro began to play.

‚ÄúS-S-S-STEEEVVEE in the MORNING. GOOOOOOOOOOD MORNING SEEEEEATTLE.‚Äù The exaggerated voice overlay was capped off with an air horn. Man, oh man, we need to change that soon.

As the last bit of music from the intro played, I then went through my daily morning briefing to the great city of Seattle. Our show had a decent number of listeners, mainly morning commuters or early risers, and played from 4 a.m. to around noon when the afternoon crew rolled in.

""...and it looks like the thundershowers are here to stay this morning and potentially well into the afternoon. Now what you have all been waiting for, let's get to those phones!""

Luke pointed over at me and a small flashing red light on my desk indicated we had someone on the line. With one click of a button near the microphone boom, the first caller was on the air.

""Hey, hey neighbor! How are we doing this morning?""

A raspy woman's voice came through the headset almost as if she was out of breath.

""Steve, h-hi. W-what's going on? What is in the sky? I don't want to look. It *wants* me to, but I don't want to look!""

Slight confusion roused my tired mind, but what was happening finally clicked.

""Uh-oh folks, looks like we got ourselves a prank caller."" A low whistle noise was played by the producer. ""I guess we will have anyone on these days! All right ‚Äòpranker‚Äô, I will indulge you. What's your name?""

""M-mary""

""Alright Mary, what *is* in the sky this morning? It sure as hell *isn't* the sun!"" I forced a fake laugh and the famous *bud-dum-tss* of a snare followed.

""I-I'm not sure. I'll just take a glance... I think‚Ä¶ It's beautiful. It's looking right at me; *he's* **looking** right at me!""

For a second, I really didn't know what to say. But the radio show ‚Äòkiller‚Äô is dead air, and over the years I learned how to improvise.

""Ha-ha Mary, all right you got your kicks. Say goodbye to everyone! I hope you had fun.""

""Steve, you need to loo-""

The line clicked as we cut off the caller. A cuckoo bird played, and Luke and I smiled at one another coyly.

*It's too early for this shit,* I thought. We have plenty of prank callers, but I admit this one made me a little uneasy for my liking. We occasionally have the typical drunk frat kids call in, still awake from the bars that would have closed just a few hours before, but this lady seemed right off her rocker. Something about her voice, she seemed genuinely frightened.

""We all love the prank callers, but come on folks, wasn‚Äôt our Halloween special enough?! All right people, on to the next caller!""

I clicked on the next caller as the light flashed red.

""Hey there Seattelite, how is the commute this breezy November morning? As we approach 5 a.m. hour I know it's probab-""

An elderly man's voice spoke loudly through my headset.

""Don't look in the clouds, whatever you do, **do not** look into the clouds! My poor son, he's gone mad - Steve, you need to tell people not to look up!""

I shot the producer a confused look. How did he manage to get two loons back-to-back? Something on my face registered with him, Luke just shrugged in an ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù sort of way.

""Okay, very funny. I don't know how you managed, but you and your friend Mary are pretty clever! This will go down as one of our-""

""STEVE LISTEN TO ME YOU DUMB FUCK.""

I barely had time to flick my thumb over the button to remove the caller as the outburst happened.

""Sorry folks, we obviously are having some hooligans on air this morning. We apologize for the obscene language. We will take a quick break and be back with some of your fellow morning commuters after *Sister Golden Hair*!""

As *America* started to strum the first few chords, I removed my headset and quickly got up. I stormed into the production booth with a few choice words on my mind.

""Luke, what the fuck was that? You know the FCC can fine us for that kind of language. I get we were told to boost our ratings, but I doubt the big man upstairs is going to be happy with what we got going on this morning. Let's vet the morning crowd out a little bit more going forward, yeah?""

""Man, I don't know what to tell you. I have ten callers on the line right now and every one of them sounds about the same as the last two.""

Did he just say *ten* more callers? We often only have three to four callers at most during the first hour of the show, let alone ten callers. Jesus, was this some sort of coordinated effort? Is some pranking group trying to go viral? Or‚Ä¶ were these *real* callers?

Some words flashed onto the producer's screen, ""NEW CALLER WAITING"" it read. Our phone line now held *eleven* callers.

""Hang up on the ten other callers and let me just take this new call off the air, Luke. If the song ends just throw on the Doobie Brothers or something.""

He flashed me a quick thumbs-up, tapped some buttons on the production panel and handed me an extra headset. Tossing the headset on, I reached toward the screen with the one remaining caller and clicked through the call.

""Hi, this is Steve with Good Morning Seattle. We just wanted to do a quick off-air check-in to see what you would like to talk with us about today.""

A voice barely registered on the headset; a faint whisper could be heard.

""Look up, look up, look up, look up, look up, look up, -""

A loud bang rang on the other end of the line and the sound of the phone clattering to the floor followed, then static. I clicked off the static line.

*What the hell was going on?*

Bright flashes from the lightning outside illuminated the shade-drawn window over the producer's shoulder. Stepping past Luke, I hesitated before pushing my fingers through a flap of the shades, spreading two flaps to get a look outside. Peeking through I looked down three stories to the street below. The storm was still raging and the early morning light still had not come over the horizon, the first signs of light would not come for at least another hour or two. Squinting down to the street below, stormwater had flooded the empty street. Up the road I spotted a car speeding, going at least 60-70 mph, the driver would be crazy to have to go at that speed on these small side streets. Just a second after I noticed it hydroplaned and swerved into an adjacent building; a person ejected from the vehicle and skidded 30 feet from the wreckage. I looked up and down the road, but there were no other cars in sight, I might have been the only one who had seen this terrible crash, we had to call the police!

""Christ, Luke call the- ""As I began to look up and turn toward the producer, something else caught my eye. In the distant horizon across the Puget Sound above the Olympic Mountain range, a shadow loomed in the dark clouds as lightning flashed. Impossibly large wings slowly flapped down, appearing to almost brush the tips of the snow-capped mountains in the distance. The flash faded and I peered harder out across the Sound. In my peripherals, Evergreens stood in the nearby park, whipping back and forth violently as wind gusts picked up loose trash from the surrounding area.

Another flash of lightning illuminated the stormy sky; this time the midsection of the winged beast was clear. Large red eyes gleamed in the dark sky from a swirling tendril-covered face. Even at this distance, I could tell, it was looking *right* at me. I couldn‚Äôt look away; my eyes began to water but I couldn‚Äôt blink. A low guttural voice began speaking to me. It spoke so loudly that I felt my skull vibrate as it reverberated through my eardrums.

‚Äú***Mgr'luh ya ng stell'bsna, Y' ah Cthulhu***‚Äù

My vision began to blur - the red eyes filled them. A vast desert spread out in front of me. The bones of millions and millions of people lay stacked in a grand pile. Scanning my surroundings I saw decaying corpses strewn all around me. Looking down at my arms and legs, they appeared malnourished, and skinny to the bone. Rising panic began filling my body, the horror around me culminating in an internal scream. In the distance, the giant beast filled the horizon, making its way back to its fortress of bones. Wind began whipping the desert sand across my body, gashing away at my thin skin, ripping off all of what I had left on my wilting body. I fell to my knees as I realized I would succumb to the beast soon; the certain doom was inevitable. It would take everything, for it was hungry and that hunger was not yet sated. I could feel its hunger, a bottomless pit never to be filled, a black hole sucking in the universe.

A hand yanked hard on my shoulder, my hand broke away from its fixed spot opening the blinds. I jerked around, fumbling back, and finally fell on my ass. Shifting back to reality I sat there shaking. How long had I been looking through the blinds? How long had I been in that place? Hours, days, months, *years*? My perception of time was completely warped.

Reeling, I looked up at Luke ‚Äì eyes stinging - we were back in the studio. The last few chords of *Sister Golden Hair* finished playing in the background from Luke‚Äôs headset which he now clutched in his hand. I was back in the studio; I had never left the studio. What the *fuck* just happened?

Luke crouched to my level, ‚ÄúSteve! Jesus Christ is everything okay? Why weren‚Äôt you responding to me? Is that blood? A-are you bleeding?‚Äù

I felt what I thought were teardrops from my dried eyes rolling down my cheeks. Wiping my hand at them, a dark red liquid covered my palms. My god, my eyes were bleeding! Clenching my eyes shut, I rubbed them to soothe the sting.

I finally mustered out a response, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt look outside.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Steve, what happened to you? What‚Äôs outside?‚Äù He got up and took a step towards me and the window, hand outstretched.

‚ÄúI said don‚Äôt look god dammit!‚Äù I Smacked his hand away with force.

Luke looked down at me puzzled, the same sheepish look from earlier that morning.

‚ÄúFine Steve, but you need to see a doctor. Your eyes‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt look good.‚Äù

My eyes still burned like crazy, but that was the least of my concern.

‚ÄúLuke, we need to get back on the air. There's something‚Ä¶ something is out there Luke. Something big is coming this way. It's hungry, it wants us; it wants *all* of us. I am not sure what *it* is, but we need to tell people. People need to know! They need to run!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat, are we being attacked? Is it‚Ä¶ terrorists? Another country?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ Its-‚Äù I lacked the words to explain what had just happened to me; to describe what I saw. To describe the hunger; to describe the black hole that the beast was. I clambered for the right words, ‚ÄúThere is something out there that wants to *kill* us. If you look at it, it will kill you. Do you have family in the city? You need to call them right now ‚Äì hell, you need to get to them and get out of town yourself!‚Äù

‚ÄúSteve, you‚Äôre scaring me. You know my family is from Philly, I moved out here for this gig! What the hell is going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need to trust me, Lukey. You need to leave town. Get in your car, drive away and don‚Äôt look back. But before you go, I need you to set me up to go live; I need to warn others!‚Äù

Luke seemed to ponder this. In the momentary silence, the doubled pane glass windows shook in their frames as the wind picked up, howling just outside the studio. The wind was getting stronger as it grew nearer. I could still feel its gaze on me now, it had *seen* me, and it would not forget me. It wanted me; it *needed* me.

Luke finally broke the silence, ‚ÄúI am going to stay with you. I have nowhere to go.‚Äù He looked away troubled and questioning what he just said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna lie though man, I‚Äôm scared. Give it to me straight, are we going to be all right? Are we about to die?‚Äù

Shakily I responded, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but we might be able to save others.‚Äù

We both looked at each other for a moment, not sure of what to say. Luke held out a hand and helped me up, I pulled him into a brief hug.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt leave you.‚Äù I said aloud, trying to give what assurance I could to the young producer.

I walked back out of the production booth and into the studio. Sitting back down on the cracked leather chair, I put the headset back on and swiveled the microphone close, preparing myself as best I could. Luke pointed in my direction, the music from the headset had been cut and we were live once again.

‚ÄúFolks‚Ä¶ there is no easy way to say this, but you must evacuate the city. Drive east, north, or south it doesn‚Äôt matter, but you can‚Äôt stay here. I repeat, you *must* evacuate the city, this is not a joke or a hoax this is *real*.‚Äù

I paused, thinking of what to say next.

‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ this is going to sound crazy. There is a flying creature that- well it's coming to kill us all. You must pack up your family and leave now! Leave as fast as you can!‚Äù

Looking up I saw Luke‚Äôs expression had turned to that of a small child that was confused and scared, he looked helpless. That‚Äôs when Luke‚Äôs words dawned on me.

*Nowhere to go*

‚ÄúIf anyone wants to call our studio we are still here and will remain live for as long as possible. Please call in, our lines are clear. Call 206-555-0206, again 206-555-0206.‚Äù

Almost immediately Luke waved and pointed towards me. The red flashing light pinged on the desk in front of me and I clicked in the first caller.

‚ÄúHello, this is Steve. Where are you and what are you doing?‚Äù

The soft, thin voice of a young girl spoke back.

‚ÄúHi, I need help. My parents are gone, and I just woke up. I heard your voice on the radio, and you told me to call you. Can you help me?‚Äù

The blood in my face drained, I was *not* expecting this.

‚ÄúHi sweetie, everything is going to be okay. Is there anyone else with you in the house? Do you have neighbors?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy older brother is here but he‚Äôs still sleeping. He told me to *never* wake him up, he gets grumpy when I wake him up early and will pick on me if I wake him up.‚Äù

‚ÄúSweetie, you need to wake him up and put him on the phone, it's important.‚Äù

A soft plopping of feet on hardwood could be heard as the young girl ran to her brother.

‚ÄúDanny ‚Äì Danny, you need to wake up. There is someone on the phone for you! Danny, you need to talk to him, wake up!‚Äù

An adolescent boy's voice could be heard in the background.

‚ÄúSaddie, w-what‚Äôs going on‚Ä¶ what time is it?‚Äù Blinds could be heard pulling up from a drawstring. ‚ÄúSaddie, it's still dark outside -¬† you should be in bed. Where‚Äôs mom‚Ä¶ what is that?‚Äù The sound of bedsheets shifted, and the boy‚Äôs voice dragged to a monotone, ‚ÄúOh noooo‚Ä¶ oh no‚Ä¶ oh no‚Ä¶OH NO‚Ä¶ OH NO‚Ä¶‚Äù the boy now shrieked in panic.

Scared, I yelled into the microphone, ‚ÄúSaddie don‚Äôt look out the window! Please no, don‚Äôt look outside!‚Äù But it was too late.

The boy kept repeating, ‚ÄúOH NO, OH NO, OH NO‚Ä¶‚Äù Then finally a scream from the young girl rang out as the line cut off. My mouth hung open, and a lump swelled in my throat.

*What am I even doing?* The thought came to me but before I had time to process it, the red light started to flash. I clicked in the next caller.

My voice trembled, ‚ÄúH-Hi, this is Steve‚Ä¶ What is your name and where are you?‚Äù

A man's voice came across the line.

‚ÄúHey Steve, I‚Äôm Ben, a long-time listener and first-time caller!‚Äù Ben chuckled to himself, ‚ÄúI thought Halloween was over? I loved your guys‚Äô special a couple of weeks ago, but I didn‚Äôt know you would keep the immersion going this long! Great stuff guys, keep it up!‚Äù

Panic rose in me, ‚ÄúNo wait, listen! This is *real*, you need to leave the city! Where are you at?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm in Bothell and hey, I am a *huge* fan, hell my kids will love to listen to the playback of this! I‚Äôm actually listening in on my phone about to head out the door for work, and this is seriously great stuff guys-‚Äù

The headset picked up a door squeaking on its hinges. *He‚Äôs leaving the house!* I cut him off mid-sentence.

‚ÄúListen to me motherfucker, close your door and pack your things. You and your family need to get out of town! This is not a fucking bit!‚Äù

‚ÄúWoah, woah hey, easy there Steve I know‚Ä¶‚Äù His voice trailed off, ¬†‚ÄúMy neighbor is here‚Ä¶ hang on.‚Äù His line then muffled as he took the phone away from his face, ‚ÄúBill, it's too early for yard work. What‚Äôre you doin‚Äô pal? Guess what? I'm on the radio right now! What are you lookin‚Äô at anyway?‚Äù

I slammed my desk in frustration, ‚ÄúGod dammit no!‚Äù. The line cut out once again.

Staring up at the booth look met my gaze before putting his head in his hands. I couldn‚Äôt hear him, but I knew he was sobbing. The red light flashed, and I clicked in the next caller.

With newfound determination, I thought to myself that I wouldn‚Äôt -no, *couldn‚Äôt -* let anyone else die.

‚ÄúHi, this is Steve! You need to listen to me! Do not look in the sky outside, pack what you can and leave town!‚Äù

A familiar voice came through.

‚ÄúSteve this is Bella, I can‚Äôt reach your cell, what‚Äôs going on? I have been listening all morning, I won‚Äôt look outside. My mom and dad are awake too, but I haven‚Äôt seen them since they told me to pack my things. My door‚Äôs closed but I think I can hear them talking‚Ä¶ or chanting something out in the living room? I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù

My niece, sister, and brother-in-law lived only a few miles from the studio. My stomach sank at the thought of something happening to them, this was my chance; I might still be able to save them.

‚ÄúListen Bell, I‚Äôm here. Just focus on my voice. Deep breaths.‚Äù

My niece let in and out three long breaths. The tenseness in my shoulder momentarily relaxed, and I was relieved my niece was all right, but I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if my sister and brother-in-law were okay too.

‚ÄúGood girl, now you‚Äôre gonna have to help me out here hon. Don‚Äôt look outside any windows, but I need you to crack the door and see what‚Äôs going on in the living room. Can you do that for me?

Her voice trembled, ‚ÄúY-yes, yes I can do that.‚Äù. A twist of a doorknob could be heard as Bella cracked her bedroom door into the living room. The chanting she described was now clearly audible.

‚ÄúWe will serve. We will serve. We will serve.‚Äù A man and woman‚Äôs voice kept repeating the same phrase over and over.

Bella spoke out, ‚ÄúMom... dad?

I could feel the building shake and looked up from my stupor. Luke was looking nervously toward the windows. Flipping one side of my headset off, I heard the building creak and moan on its old frame. I stared precariously at the vibrating windows Luke‚Äôs attention was on. The vibration of the glass would surely shatter them soon.

‚ÄúWe will serve!‚Äù The chant ‚Äì now a shout ‚Äì ripped my attention back to the headset.

‚ÄúListen, Bella, is that your mom and dad?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, they are looking at me, but they won't respond to anything I say. They just keep saying the same thing.‚Äù The chant grew louder, ‚ÄúThey are walking right at me!‚Äù, she exclaimed.

‚ÄúBella close the door!‚Äù A bang of a door came through clearly, muffling my sister and brother-in-law‚Äôs voices. The studio windows finally gave in. Glass shattered inward and heavy winds began flinging loose items around the small room. A piece of glass gashed my already bloody cheek, and I shrank my face away from that side of the room as the blinds lifted from gusts of air.

Shielding my eyes, I chanced a glance at the production booth. Luke stood dead straight looking directly out the window. His eyes grew wide and instantly bloodshot, blood began to streak slowly from his tear ducts and ears. Luke then began mouthing something in the booth to himself.

*We will serve*

The building groaned and began to wane, the old brick building and wooden floor started to crumble around me. I held onto the fixed table bolted to the ground as the leather chair began to roll away on the shifting floor. With one firm grip on the table and another on my headset, I cried out to my niece.

‚ÄúBella, can you still hear me!? Bella, you need to get out of the house and leave the city! Get in your car and leave!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Uncle Steve I know! I just don‚Äôt know *how* to leave! I can barely hear you, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù A banging was coming from Bella‚Äôs phone. ‚ÄúOh god, I think they are at the door. They are trying to break the door down!‚Äù

‚ÄúBella listen to me, climb out your window! Hell, break it open! Go now!‚Äù The building began tilting in an awkward direction as the earth below shook the foundations. I was losing my grip on the edge of the table. My chair swiveled and was now facing the busted-out studio windows. My arm fully outstretched grasped the table as I hung on for dear life. As the window shades flapped up and down, the winged beast went in and out of sight. The beast had made its way past the Olympic Mountain range which lay burning in the distance and was now directly over Puget Sound. The large body completely filled the horizon as far as I could see in each direction, cracks in the earth swallowed whole city blocks. Tendrils trailed down from the beast not only from its face but from all over its body, rolling down to the writhing ocean surface. The slow flap of its massive, hooked wings surged down, causing massive tsunami-sized swells to form off the Seattle coastline. Water began surging into the city, whole skyscrapers fell from the converging ocean and wind.

It was here.

I could no longer look away as its red eyes beamed at me. Each time the eyes revealed with the flap up of the shade, I could feel my corneas flash cook from its leer.

A loud crack and bang came over the headset. Bella screamed; glass shattered as a window was smashed on the other end of the line. Chants came over through the headset, ‚ÄúWe will serve!‚Äù

Bella cried out ‚ÄúUncle Steve!‚Äù as the headset slipped off my head and out of my grip. The tilt of the floor finally pulled the chair out from under me, and I thrust my free arm up to the table, still managing to hold on. The blinds flew off the window frame and now I could fully see the beast‚Äôs eyes uninterrupted emanating in the dark sky. ¬†

Had my niece escaped? Was it too late?

‚ÄúBella‚Ä¶Bella‚Ä¶‚Äù I could only manage to murmur as I felt the beast‚Äôs hunger fill my very soul.

The beast bellowed out as it crossed the coastline into the crumbling city. The noise from the beast burst my eardrums, and I felt the trickle of blood run at the side of my face as the unnatural guttural language came from the winged horror.

‚Äú***AHNYTH CTHULU***‚Äù

My eyes were set ablaze and engulfed in the red ire of the tendril-filled face. Its eyes sank directly into my frontal cortex. I screamed out as I let go of the table.

I'm a new grad nurse who recently went out with a medical student. Only spent a handful of hours together, but he and I seemed to be kindred souls. However, I saw the writing on the wall when he shared what his schedule looked like for his third year in medical school. He lives about an hour out from me now, which isn't the most convenient thing either. A couple days ago, he texted me this:

Him: So I had some big oofs from my preceptor - turns out I am on call with her this whole weekend. Had an appendectomy and cholecystectomy that were really interesting but took up literally the entirety of last night, and now I‚Äôm super behind on my other work - and I have no way of knowing how much time I have for the rest of the weekend to focus on that stuff, so I‚Äôm just buckling down and trying to get it done asap. I‚Äôm feeling the deadlines coming up on me though, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to swing a hang tonight. I‚Äôm so sorry for plans changing like this, I didn‚Äôt know surgery was going to be so chaotic and time consuming :/ 

The other frustrating thing is I‚Äôm taking a gander at my schedule, and it looks like my next weekend is booked with an EGD for me (I‚Äôve got eosinophilic esophagitis) and another buddy‚Äôs wedding planning events (suit fitting followed by a boys night hangout/plan session), and then the weekend after that I‚Äôm celebrating Thanksgiving with my family and our closest cousins for pretty much the whole weekend since I‚Äôm scheduled on Thanksgiving itself. December isn‚Äôt all shaped up yet, but I worry it might be kinda similar, and it might be the case that during my surgery rotation, I‚Äôm just not available for much more than a short coffee date every other week or so. 

All that said, I‚Äôd love to let you know where my head is at with everything. Some context that might be helpful to know is that my last relationship ended because we both ended up in med school in separate states and just could not dedicate the time to make the relationship work. I felt terribly guilty about not being able to be a good partner simply because I didn‚Äôt have the time to be. When it comes to you and me, I had a ton of fun on our dates, and really appreciate the kind words we get to exchange via text, and I‚Äôve felt that a relationship with the two of us would be worth exploring, but I‚Äôm getting a lot of those same feelings about not being able to dedicate the proper amount of time or mental energy that are needed to start a meaningful relationship. I thought that I would have a fair bit more time to focus on this going in, but after learning a bit about my call schedule, the projects I need to complete, and some of the other side stuff that is expected of me, I have a strong sense that trying to start a relationship in these circumstances is going to be something that causes a lot of internal discord within me that I‚Äôm not feeling equipped to manage at the moment. 

At this moment, I want to thank you for your time and the wonderful experience of getting to go on a date and chat, but I think you deserve to be able to seek romance in a more fulfilling situation than I am able to accommodate right now, and I know that I‚Äôll feel terrible moving forward if I‚Äôm only able to go on dates every other week or so and I feel like I‚Äôm stringing you along for a suboptimal dating experience with a guy whose mind is very focused on med school right now. So I think you ought to be able to date as you please going forward and find something good for you. And who knows? If by chance we‚Äôre both single and happen to run into each other in when I move back to ______ (my town) this July, perhaps we could start fresh in more ideal circumstances.

Apologies for sharing these thoughts over text, I would have preferred to do so in person, but I figured that as soon as these thoughts solidified, you deserved to be made aware asap. And also apologies for the novel‚Äôs worth of text - I‚Äôm not exactly known for my brevity! I hope that what I‚Äôm saying makes sense, and that it‚Äôs clear that this decision is truly a product of my life/career situation and the feelings I‚Äôm sensitized to given the way that my last relationship ended. You‚Äôre a wonderful gal, and you‚Äôve been a delight to talk to and get to know, and I have nothing but positive feelings for you, I‚Äôm just in a situation that makes me feel I cant be who I need to be in order to feel good about dating in this situation. Please let me know if there‚Äôs anything else you want to talk about that might be helpful, I want to be fair to you and anything you might feel in this situation, of course!

Me: Aw ____, it‚Äôs okay. I understand your situation, it sounds like you‚Äôve taken on a lot. 

For the record, I had a lot of fun with you too but saw the writing on the wall with your busy schedule. Obviously, I can‚Äôt say that I know you well, but I like to think that I have good instincts. To me, everything you say is just adorned in goldü•π

For the first time in my life, I have been ~casually~ dating. You‚Äôve been my favorite by far, even with just one lil date. I‚Äôve kinda dreaded going out with guys from church/hinge who have been duped into asking me out because I‚Äôve compared them to youüòÇ it‚Äôs not fair, but it‚Äôs true. 

if you find that your life opens up a bit more, please do contact me. If that‚Äôs a ‚Äúsimp-y‚Äù thing to say, quite frankly, I don‚Äôt care. That‚Äôs me shooting my shot because I know I‚Äôd be mad at myself if I didn‚Äôt give a lil encouragement for you down the road. 

I think you‚Äôre a stellar person destined to do great things (and not just in medical school, don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself‚ò∫Ô∏è)!!

I‚Äôll keep doing my own thing. Thanks for allowing me to get to know you better. I‚Äôm glad I had the chance to :)) 

Him: Thanks ____, your understanding of my whole situation means quite a lot to me! I hope you know that I think you‚Äôre a stellar person too, and wish you all the best! I hope that the dating goes well for you, and that ya find a fella worthy of your awesomeness üòä

I‚Äôll keep ya in the know if my situation changes, I appreciate the shot shooting, and don‚Äôt find it simp-y in the slightest! I was kinda doing it myself with the whole ‚Äúif we‚Äôre both single and in a better situation somewhere down the line‚Äù portion of my novelüòÇ

You‚Äôre an excellent individual, clearly a compassionate and talented nurse, and I know you‚Äôll kick butt in everything that you do in life! I‚Äôm glad to have met you, and I‚Äôm wishing you all the best :) 

--Anyway...I am wondering if you think he was actually into me. The old adage ""if he wanted to, he would,"" comes to mind, and my friends and family are telling me he wasn't feeling it. However, I think this is a monumental period of his life and it is completely understandable for school to be his priority...he's in the thick of something he's undoubtedly made many sacrifices for. I don't know much about medical school, but I am confident that the level of intensity is insane. I really do believe what he's saying, but nobody else does. I'll keep dating other people, but I've just never met anyone like him before and am wondering if I'm crazy for thinking he was being honest here. 

Med students--have you felt similarly to him when it comes to dating because of an insane schedule? Or do you think he's just letting me down easy?",3,1731360473.0,medicalschool,7,0.64,False
1gp3ptg,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1gp3ptg/i_think_my_dad_is_some_embodiment_of_toxic/,I think my dad is some embodiment of toxic masculinity ,"He often calls people the f slur(like on COD) It doesn't affect me personally(I'm straight). At some points I think it's funny the way he says it, not the slur itself is funny. 

He has some fucking vendetta against me having longer hair. I have a theory that his reasoning is, he thinks that it makes me looks gay and he CAN'T have that. I can't confirm that or not but it would make a lot of sense.

He drinks black coffee. I drink regular iced coffee with the bullshit in it as well as my step mom. My dad has said this twice, but he says something like Oh I drink black coffee like a MANüíÄ In front of me...

I got into some serious trouble involving a trans person. He asked me twice if I was some kind of \*insert F slur\* or something. Than he later said he wouldn't care, which I call a load of bullshit. His own brother is gay and he is always sort of hating on him, he doesn't hate him but it seems like it sometimes

He hasn't liked when I cry in the past. I can think of ONE time where it was ""ok"" for him, and that's when I read a school assignment about my dead grandpa in front of him. When he would yell at me back when I was younger I couldn't stop my eyes from watering, and I could cry and he'd get mad and tell me not to cry. 

This one fucking moments really pissed me off. I think in 2020 or 2021, he found a D-Battery that shocks your tongue. He found it in a drawer and pressured me to shock my tounge with it for a video or something. I really didn't want to do it but I did it. It was fine ig I didn't get hurt. I wish I did tho that would've been funny to see him guilty. Anyways I did it. 

For no reason at all, the waterworks turned on and I started to cry. I DID NOT WANT TO CRY OR TRY TO CRY, I DIDN'T DO THAT ON PURPOSE AND DON'T KNOW THE REASONING OF THAT. Anyways he gets really mad, and sends me to clean my room. later he comes in to give me some fucking lecture about being soft hearted. This motherfucker I guess does not know the words.

The hair thing really bothers me. Idk what he gets out of me looking like Sid from Toy Story. HOP OFF!

Ok, when I was SIX and living w/my mom in california, she posted a picture of me and my dad said something like ""Oh LoOkS lIke SoMeBodY nEEds a HaiRCut. 

I got in very bad trouble last August and he made me get a haircut to how it was before I started to grow it out(last december). How it was before it grow out was, like a .5 on the sides and like a centimeter on the top. I haven't seen myself like that in a long time and I didn't want to look at it. I wanted to die, I didn't want to go to school. I hated it. What is worse, is the other autistic ass joke character of my school TYLER, he laughed at me and I couldn't really do anything about it, he had this picture of humpty dumpty and showed everyone. I told him I would kill myself he didn't really care.(My brain was a little less regular than it is now). 

If my dad has my hair buzzed I def would've killed myself. During the pandemic I got buzzed for the first time. I think that lasted for a year? Not sure. I didn't go to school back than so Idk how it would've affected me. But I THOUGHT the reasoning was money, accept he went and got his haircuts from the same place. He claims that I said I liked it which NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THE FUCK I DID NOT.

Since then I'm single. didn't plan for any date. until she(new) took the entry. So, I would like to start from the beginning: Almost 8/8.5 months ago, I met a girl via a dating app. she is also from my university, same age. we met on our campus, we talked, got introduced to each other etc etc. That day, we had a very good day. we had a dinner together. after that when I get back to home she texted me that- : ""hey, it was nice to meet you. you're a nice guy. actually, I didn't want to hurt verbally face to face. but the thing is- I got a boyfriend, it's true. I'm sorry to say that. we can be very good friends. kinda message"" (but, back in that time I really feel hurt for a moment. i was like really, com'on, seriously- after 3yrs of wait. i had to face this) I did respond to her text that- thanks for being honest. ok we'll go for coffee someday. then our flow of friendship began. we used to do hangout sometimes on campus. we do together travel by campus to home. we became very good to each other. our sharing level to each other is like- more than bf-gf, fwb, best friend. it was more than that( acccdently she is completely clone of me, we got macthing on preference 99.99%. and we got the full vibe for each other). so after our first 2/3 months later: she said- she had a fight with her bf. They broke up, so ok i was like- okay, my time has come. they broke up because of her bf said- he didn't to continue with her because he couldn't stop forgetting his ex. he was feeling lonely, that's why he got into this relationship. and she and her bf they are in relationship for two yrs. she felt bad, bcuz- he just used her as emotional support tool not as real love. so his part closed, I took the entry but I didn't want to have a relationship with her. she got a bad-time then. i was the only one who kept supported her psychologically, and mentally. i was roleplaying guardian of her. so it took almost one month to make her stable happy and strong( in the cost of sacrificing my sleep, managing time from my busy schedule and chaotic life schedule). but I was happy for her, and that was also made me happy. we were laughing, cuddling, and making fun of each other. we were so happy for each other.

time fast-forward to September. ok, it was her birthday month. I was very happy for her. we did plan for a great celebration. but on that day she was not responding my phn and text. we got planned for meet and celebrate. She responded like- ""go back home, I'm a bit busy now. I'll talk later. and he is here"". i was what??? then I waited for her text and she responded almost mid of the night(2am). i called her. she said- we did fix everything. he beg to me to give him one more chance to fix things, he was crying. so I let him. seriously, I felt so bad after hearing this. she know I do want to grow with her, but I did never confess to her about my feelings. we're just keeping with the flow. so when she told me- about all those things. i replied- he did fake act/ fake feeling with you in the name of loneliness. how could you accept that, huh? she said- he said sorry, and do love him. i feel hurt again by her. i can't shutout on her, cuz com'on that's disrespect. but keep the friendship.

time fast forward to almost 2weeks later of her birthday, and they did fight again, they stopped talking. cuz this time he was trying to dominate her, kinda like, abusive rules like do share location all the time bullshit pathetic type rules. anyway she again told me about her situation- I did support her again. but this type we started to talk about our bonding- she said she don't want us be together, she feel scare of losing people. she don't to involve in this again. i said just keep going with the flow. just faith in fate. if we mean to be together we'll, if we don't we'll not be together. so did help her to grow. we made so much progress together.‚Ç¨this time she did closed to me even more than any other time: we started to spent a lot of time together. it was like we were made for each other. except we just didn't confess to her about feelings. since then till now we are everything to each otherso nothing to say now. after hearing this ( I lied and I said- great, buy hey if you don't mind I got a hurry now, I'll talk to you later) i really really felt bad for this again. myb or myb not I'll see her again. ok story end

 so that was my story for behind for my help.

fellas, now i need your help/myb advice/suggetions/ myb some motivation/myb tell what should i reply to her after what she did, and i have done for her.

i'll be really grateful if you pull me out of this stuck moment. She is special to me, we have the 99.99% vibe match on everything, I never met someone like before. myb its my bad, to grow feelings for her. i don't know, dude! what should I do.

Over the last few days at various locations I've had men hit on me.

Today is a normal day, with a normal look. I was in the grocery store buying some odds and ends. This guy walking down the isle smiles at me and I smile back. He holds out his hand and I guess from not being a total germ-a-phobe I shook his hand. He introduced himself. (I'm thinking to myself if I know him from someplace or whatnot) I don't! He asked me my name and told me his. Then asked me for coffee. I explained my honey would be not too happy. He then said my ""husband"" is a lucky man. I'm married for over 37 years to my WIFE. I didn't say that last part. But this girl STILL GOT IT!!! LOLOLOLOLOL. I find it crazy that this has happened 3 or 4 different times. My wife being with me at dinner a few days ago. Like they think we are ""friends or sisters or some such. Anyway wanted to share a bit  of something nice in this election nightmare. ",9,1731359673.0,transpassing,0,1.0,False
1gp3e8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1gp3e8k/how_do_you_properly_end_a_conversation/,How do you properly end a conversation?,"Often when I talk to people, especially strangers, I don't know how to end the conversation. It's not that I necessarily want to end it, but I sometimes become unsure of when it's the proper time to end it, and how I should do it without coming off as rude.

For example, if I start talking to someone at a party, I usually ask some questions and get a conversation going. After a while, I start thinking that I'm using up too much of this person's time and that they probably don't want to talk to me anymore but they're too polite to end the conversation. So I tend to just let the conversation die and start awkwardly looking around me until the other person leaves or starts talking to someone else.

Or during small talk with colleagues at work, maybe we stop and talk for a bit by the coffee machine. I feel rude if I try to speed up the conversation and leave, and instead keep talking to seem polite. But then again I start feeling unsure if the person is also just trying to be polite to me but they actually just want to leave.

I have a hard time reading people in general, but especially in these situations. I was diagnosed with Asperger's as a kid, so that's probably the main reason.",4,1731359665.0,socialskills,2,1.0,False

Last year December, in my home country, I met a girl on Bumble. The first date I set up, I was running late and had to cancel but I asked for a second chance and she agreed for a date the next day. We met and had a coffee together and liked each other's vibe. I asked for another date the next day before I was traveling to meet relatives (but would be back in a week).

Took her to a fine dine restaurant and she liked it. When I was back from my relatives place we met once more to go to a new year's party (which was boring) and then she told me she has accepted a job in a foreign country. 

This country is 2 hours away by flight from my work country, so Mine is Country A hers is country B and our home country is Country C.

I was overjoyed. She moved first. I returned to my work country later. We had already exchanged our contacts but this point.

For some reason, I believed she would be my wife.

As I was returning, at the layover airport, I bought her a pair of gold earrings. Showed it to her over Instagram and she liked it.

But as she was going to be based in a different country I would have to wait to get a visa to get there. 

Weeks pass, and we are chatting fine, but one Thursday she just blocked me out of the blue on Instagram. 
No explanation whatsoever. I assumed she met somebody and moved on, still holding the earrings.

I'm currently traveling back to my home country and her WhatsApp account is showing as active, plus based on her profile picture, she seems to have returned our home country. 

Question:
Should I reach out, gift her the earrings 

Or 

Should I never reach out and sell those earrings and get something for myself instead.

‚ÄúNothing like some space coffee from space mom‚Äôs newly opened space diner on this lovely space day.‚Äù Hoagie says with a barely concealed snicker as she scrunched her eyes shut and tried not to laugh.

‚ÄúDaniel, thank you for being my first customer and helping me set up this lovely diner. But please. Stop.‚Äù She says.

‚ÄúBut mom, it‚Äôs just some basic space slang. We just need to get you used to speaking space languages with the space people now that we both live in...‚Äù His unending cascade of saying ‚Äòspace whatever‚Äô is cut off as his communicator goes off.

‚ÄúEastman.‚Äù He listens for a bit and frowns. ‚ÄúOkay... I‚Äôll be there.‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúSpace ship in the space lane is not space answering the space phone.‚Äù He starts to explain and she shakes her head as she walks over and gently helps him out of his seat and slowly pushes him out the door as he keeps going with the silly joke. ‚ÄúSo anyways I need to space see what‚Äôs going space over space there and...‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough space Daniel. Go out and get things done.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut will you want to hear about my space adventures after space mom?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no thank you, I drink too much caffeine as is.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt we all?‚Äù Janet asks. ‚ÄúAnyways, my son had just left and he of course started moving quickly. You‚Äôve seen these boys in motion you know that when they hustle they really hustle...‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt to Administration that Daniel had raced to, it was a shuttle bay. The doors out were already open with a forcefield shimmering a barely visible blue and he touches at the spot on his arm where the mark of The Undaunted was branded onto him. All of The Undaunted Station Staff had taken the Brand, and it had outright terrified other residents of the station. More than a few fights were broken up by removing the shirt and forcing one of the belligerent parties to feel the branding.

No one wants to fight someone crazy enough to burn their very essence for an edge in battle. There‚Äôs only one other Undaunted in the shuttle bay. ‚ÄúDemon a pleasure, as always.‚Äù

The other man has a full foot and a half and several hundred pounds of raw muscle on him. More resembling a silverback on steroids than a normal human, a blurry photo of the man could easily be mistaken for Sasquatch if it ate nothing but pure protein.

‚ÄúGood to see you Hoagie. Did you get the full message or were you only told to get over here in a hurry?‚Äù

‚ÄúUnidentified ship refusing to answer hails, scans are showing both many life signs and zero life signs and only emergency life support is still on as it‚Äôs drifted in from the nearest Axiom Lane.‚Äù Daniel replies and Demon nods.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs about the sum of it. There‚Äôs a slight update too...‚Äù Demon says leading him to the nearest shuttle and Daniel pauses for some reason. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve finished our scans of the ship. It‚Äôs a huge bulk freighter, with no apparent damage.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why is it acting like a haunted derelict?‚Äù

‚ÄúBetting in Admin says ghosts.‚Äù

‚ÄúGhosts my \*\*\*.‚Äù Daniel responds before pointing to another shuttle. Painted bright red and streamlined. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll take mine, it‚Äôs better.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou and your \*\*\*\* red car.‚Äù

‚ÄúMiss Eastman, I assure you that I can handle a little bit of crude language.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust because you can handle something doesn‚Äôt mean you have to.‚Äù She replies with a saintly smile.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure. Although I am curious as to which soldier has been nicknamed Demon of all things and why.‚Äù Observer Wu notes.

‚ÄúHis name is Sergeant Joseph Eto. He earned his nickname during the ride through Cruel Space, apparently the lawyers of The Undaunted tried to see if they could legally own other people‚Äôs souls and he beat so many of them at their own game that he himself legally owned the souls of ten percent of the entire ship, including a full quarter of the legal division before that was put a stop to.‚Äù Janet explains and Observer Wu sighs.

‚ÄúOf course he did. Please continue.‚Äù

‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢

‚ÄúAlright... this is a... clearly modified ship, the power readings in it show that there are some fairly hefty bits of madness going around in what should be internal cargo bays.‚Äù Demon reads out and Daniel leans over to look at his screen.

‚ÄúWhat the? That IS odd. There must be something major in the central storage bay if it draws in this level of power even when deactivated.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs off? Could be some kind of partial shielding giving us lighter readings.‚Äù Demon counters.

‚ÄúPossible, but none of our sensors are picking up any of the kind of interference that any kind of scan shielding would put out.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny kind of known scan shielding, galaxy‚Äôs a big place.‚Äù

‚ÄúPoint taken. Is The Spin still trying to contact them?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf the radio waves and communication beams were in the visible spectrum we‚Äôd be half blinded by the light.‚Äù Demon replies and Daniel considers.

‚ÄúWell, the ship hasn‚Äôt proven hostile despite having functional weapon systems. Are we still getting those ghost readings?‚Äù

‚ÄúLife signs flickering in and out? Yes.‚Äù Demon replies and Daniel grins.

‚ÄúAlright, we‚Äôre coming up to a shuttle bay... Still no response?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing. We could jump out the shuttle and land on the thing no problem and still no response.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôm engaging magnetic clamps. Let‚Äôs get inside and get to the bridge. This sucker is tumbling to The Spin and if we don‚Äôt have to break it apart the better.‚Äù Daniel says and the hot red shuttle clamps to the side of the large ship.

‚ÄúCommunicator on and ready.‚Äù Demon says tucking his into a breast pocket with a hole cut into it to serve as a body camera. Daniel nods as he does the same as they both make their way to the airlock.

The lack of air means nothing can be heard if not for their communicators. It also meant the tiny sounds of movement, of clothing rustling and the whispery scrape of skin against a handle to manually force an airlock from the outside is incredibly loud in the micro atmospheres surrounding each man. In less than a minute they‚Äôre inside, atmosphere rushes back in and after they secure the outer airlock door they force the inner airlock door.

‚ÄúEmergency lights only. This place is really in low power mode.‚Äù Demon notes as he looks around the extremely empty shuttle bay.

‚ÄúBut why? Almost all power comes from the Axiom of the galaxy, these lights are only needed if for some reason the ship is in an area with low Axiom Density.‚Äù Daniel asks.

‚ÄúThere are no good answers to that question.‚Äù Demon says as he quickly pulls out and puts together a large rifle. The type most soldiers can only use on an emplacement or with a small team. Daniel begins assembling his own smaller weapon. His however has a pair of small attachments. What it lacks in firepower it makes up for in a grenade launcher and a flashlight.

He uses the flashlight to sweep the room looking for anything out of place. Neither man sees anything and Demon nods to the exit into the main corridors of the ship. Both go to the sides of the door and before they can force it, it opens automatically. Both men check the hallway and only then do they check the controls of the door.

‚ÄúThe doors are still active for some reason. And their sensors are in far more spectrums than normal. The cameras here sense things in ultraviolet.‚Äù Demon states.

‚ÄúNot anymore they don‚Äôt.‚Äù Daniel says and Demon follows the beam of his flashlight to reveal a destroyed camera.

‚ÄúSome kind of mutiny and then abandonment? Their shuttle bay is empty after all.‚Äù

‚ÄúPossible. To the bridge.‚Äù Daniel answers and both men start moving.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need to take a lift down a level. I studied the blueprints of these models. The bridge is more sensibly placed inside the superstructure rather than sitting on top.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank god. Ships with windows of all things on them always make me want to scream in frustration.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that bad when they use things like a massive diamond pane or transparent aluminum. But yeah, windows are just asking for it nine times out of ten.‚Äù Demon agrees.

‚ÄúThe only times it‚Äôs not is closer to a literal one in a million. It‚Äôs good to see sensible ship design.‚Äù

‚ÄúEven if we are technically...‚Äù Demon begins before cutting himself off and pointing his rifle back the way they came. Daniel covers the other direction without needing to be told and there‚Äôs a tense moment. ‚ÄúHmm... false alarm... I think.‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething is watching us.‚Äù

‚ÄúHopefully it‚Äôs just someone‚Äôs pet or a basic AI or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich just leads to further questions. People don‚Äôt ditch perfectly good ships for no reason.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, but I‚Äôd rather deal with some kind of stupid coincidence than a literal haunting.‚Äù Demon states and Daniel nods.

Both men make it to the bridge without further interference and find the consoles on but in a low power mode. ‚ÄúSomething is here.‚Äù Daniel says as he brushes dust off a panel. He holds it up to a scanner. ‚ÄúSkin cells, dead but relatively fresh. People are still here.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre probably in the maintenance tunnels.‚Äù Demon replies as he smiles. ‚ÄúNo password, I‚Äôm in.‚Äù

It takes only a minute to get the ship‚Äôs engines to fire again and change the vector of the whole thing. It‚Äôs going to miss Octarin Spin easily and a few more precise firings of the engine means that it‚Äôs going to stay near it as it travels with the universe in motion. ‚ÄúOkay that‚Äôs our main problem dealt with. I‚Äôm opening up communications...‚Äù

Demon turns so fast he blurs and opens fire. There is the sound of screaming metal as a perfectly quiet but shoddily put together drone is shredded under his hail of bullets. His weapon has an Axiom based silence effect so that despite him spraying hundreds of bullets in that single burst, only the sound of his target and the ship behind it being slammed into by his ammo can be heard. Daniel‚Äôs flashlight illuminates things even as Demon rushes up to the side of the door the scrap pile came in through. There is a pause and he nods to his fellow soldier who shines his light down the hall.

‚ÄúClear.‚Äù Daniel says after a little bit and Demon glances out for a moment with a growl.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this. Keep the light going down the hall.‚Äù Demon orders moving away from the door and going back to the main console. A few more commands and there is a link. ‚ÄúAlright, The Spin has access to...‚Äù

Daniel sighs as Demon pauses in his explanations. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me. They just shut down the connection from the station to the ship.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright I won‚Äôt.‚Äù Demon replies and Daniel sighs.

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù Daniel remarks before calling down the hallway. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose whoever‚Äôs doing this has the guts to show their face?‚Äù

There is of course no response. Because things can never be that easy for her little boy.

‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢

There is a ringing sound as a customer arrives. ‚ÄúOh! Excuse me sir, I need to see to...‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no no no... if I knew there was a well aged touch of MAN here I‚Äôd have come flying rather than on foot.‚Äù The Snict woman says as she buzzes over and leans to the side. ‚ÄúOh a serious type? I don‚Äôt even have the curse of my people and my mouth is watering. Tell me, who do I have to talk to to see about getting a nibble?‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, no. I have my duties, I will not be marrying or ‚Äòhaving fun‚Äô with anyone. So please, stop now before you embarrass yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmbarrass myself? Oh? Oh! It‚Äôs her isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù She asks nodding to Janet.

‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs actually here to listen to stories about my son and his coworkers.‚Äù Janet remarks before tossing a wink the Snict‚Äôs way. ‚ÄúHis employers figure a pretty face will open more doors than a plasma cannon, they didn‚Äôt need to though. I‚Äôm always happy to gush about my little boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair enough! Alright mister serious, if you want a good time...‚Äù She moves to kiss Observer Wu on the side of the head and he moves away. ‚ÄúFine!‚Äù

She backs off, thankfully. She takes a seat at the counter with a laugh and Observer Wu gives his bodyguards a furious look. He gets some grins back.

‚Äú‰Ω†‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πà‰∏çÂÅö‰ªª‰Ωï‰∫ãÊÉÖÔºü‚Äù *(‚ÄúAnd why did you not do anything?‚Äù)* He asks in Mandarin.

Sir, I could see that she wouldn‚Äôt go too far. I was reaching for my gun when she leaned in and only stopped when she backed off.‚Äù)* The other replies and Observer Wu nods. That is a much better answer.

I‚Äôm a young female professional in the public sector. I have social anxiety. However, I like to think (or hope) I‚Äôm good at what I do and I enjoy helping people. Just got my Master‚Äôs this spring and promoted for the second time in May.

My job requires semi-regular public speaking at hearings. I have to communicate a lot with the public. Of all my other mental health issues, my anxiety above all else seems to have worsened rather than gotten better with practice.

For example, when I interviewed for my entry level job two years ago, I think I was on the verge of a panic attack. Thank god it was online. I faked internet issues, did the interview, and then had a total meltdown afterwards. Granted, I mistakenly had a triple shot coffee that morning thinking it would hype me up and help me focus.

Now that I‚Äôve been presenting at hearings for the past few months, I‚Äôve had terrible heart palpitations right before I have to speak. My Apple Watch even pinged me that my heart rate was over like 150 for 10+ minutes of inactivity. I‚Äôve also noticed that I have awful brain fog. I‚Äôm terrified I need medication or something to calm me down.

The supervisor position is customer service related. My assistant director supported me when I asked them today if I‚Äôd be a good fit, but I‚Äôm absolutely mortified by the prospect of another interview. Especially when I‚Äôm technically jumping 1-2 positions for this.

Do you have interview or anxiety management tips? I‚Äôm utterly suffering.",1,1731359120.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

# SPOILERS AHEAD

**The top 5 overall BEST scenes**: Cain has made his way back to the top of the charts, with Dmitry in close pursuit.

1. Cain
2. Dmitry
3. Renato
4. Ram
5. David

**The top 5 WORST scenes**: I mean, of course this is super obvious who would be number 1, haha! Very far behind we also had Ian who is just super absent, more on that later, and of course also our usual suspects.

1. Alexander
2. Ian
3. Dragan
4. Amen
5. Minhyuk

\---

**Book by Book results:**

SOCN - Huge favourite of getting Set's power and kiss, with Amen and Livius relationship scenes behind that. I wonder if that means Set is the most popular LI?? I thought it was Livius! Interesting.

We least liked defusing the argument scene, as well as Amen and Livius teaming up, and breaking up / continuing the relationship with Amen (I guess they didn't get the result they were hoping for?).

https://preview.redd.it/9wsp3gjj7c0e1.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=c656f0dabbd19b7e82a6a9bebf21923fbe885d91

CY2 - Yup... our most liked scene was Ezra's full-diamond hanky-panky scene, with his lower diamond scene of kissing and biting next. Far behind are Eve's bath scene and Sam's sex scene in the treasure room.

And of course what we disliked most was... Alexander's bdsm scene (I wonder if it's offensive to even label it was ""bdsm"" when it was some sort of non con... hm). Very far behind is the scene with the twins, and Ezra's touching scene didn't sit well with some of us either.

https://preview.redd.it/gt45ig6l7c0e1.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&s=737f0bc4c0e1347b85b7611535b0893f20cd0fd9

WTC - We most enjoyed kissing Renato. After that, hugging Shen, the emotional scene with either Vesper, Tallis, or Lucien, and teasing Vesper.

However, what we most disliked was our chat with the Praevius, and Lucien's heart-to-heart about his ex wife. We also didn't like talking about books with Vesper, the fight scene, and the hookup with Marco (either the option at all or the scene itself? Not sure).

https://preview.redd.it/55i6rp9m7c0e1.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddef7cc086d12a7a0e8caf4705931d2560c9da48

KFS - Ahah well that explains Ram's presence in the top 5. His sex scene was by far the favourite, as well as dancing with Ian and kissing Sara.

We did not like writing the letter to the Maharani, or the different paths scene, or dancing with Ian, or matchmaking Erit and Oscar.

https://preview.redd.it/6mh9sn6n7c0e1.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=b08a75237566bd7761924d7d5e560008872441ee

GOE - Our favourites were Doo-yeong's apartment scene, Seong-hwa's sex scene, Castiel's confession on his romance path, and coffee with Dean.

We most disliked Castiel confessing his love on his friendship path, very far behind we have Minhyuk's distraction scene and Minhyuk's investigation scene.

https://preview.redd.it/s4n3rv6o7c0e1.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=e012f526f4d22e76ea68b2a3987383580e177308

SLS - We loved opening up to Walter/Cynthia, as well as using Vincent as a pillow.

We hated trying to get through to Xantheia, or standing up for her, or sparing Threxio/a (bunch of bloodthirsty demons we have here lol).

https://preview.redd.it/knwkfe8p7c0e1.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=99533b0fb1458c3ed9fa5ecf1dceb44a2d75ea09

ABH - Yup, kissing David is at the top. Behind that we've got Malek's squeezing scene, Cassiel comforting MC in her bedroom, and Mikael giving us answers for once.

However, we equally hated Malek's squeezing scene (I guess people didn't understand his warnings he gave previously that he was definitely into this, lol?), and talking with the demon possessed girl. Far behind that we did not like standing up to Furius and Somnus, and the glass of water scene with Cassiel.

https://preview.redd.it/2krk186q7c0e1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab567f9ff4e121f21a804fc8fb01547f1aa878cb

HSR - Very predictably we loved having Dmitry in MC's room, and also being in Cain's shower. Of course.

We hated chatting with priest Agape, and lesser so running after Lester (I really like that guy, I hope he survives....), and chatting with Yan.

https://preview.redd.it/jnjy2w5r7c0e1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=121a55902bb2b1107749871aa005fdb4f640804a

7B - We loved BDSM with Tristan (I guess that was done right!), dinner with Grant, the spa with Lilian, and sex with Chloe.

We did not like telling Chloe about George and Tyana, and some of us did not like the BDSM scene with Tristan.

https://preview.redd.it/0cpj4yxr7c0e1.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=b086a1326fe2ed065f452abdc224d0a7b51c2d83

HWTU - We most liked swimming with both Ozar and Volot, also the sauna with Sirin, and the sauna with Volot.

We most disliked skinning the hare, with far behind Dragan's wakeup scene, and dinner with Dragan.

https://preview.redd.it/85ue9nps7c0e1.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=29467cfd2c3670f603b1b4a09c166cd09517d177

TTS - We most liked asking Tai questions, and grilling Sha'arnez. Letting him buckle MC up was also nice, as well as touching Vellora's shoulder. Lol.

We most disliked asking the maid questions, meeting the Esshai delegation, and requesting breakfast from Tai.

https://preview.redd.it/0zwdu1yt7c0e1.png?width=709&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca86668e01c474b8aa5e0556bf2656eac7cb8570

SC - We most liked Edmund's scene, with Ralph or Edward's scene close behind. After that we have the scene with Morgana/Merlin, and Edmund toying with MC.

Least favourite we've got the further listening scene, as well as the scene with Morgana/Merlin, agreeing with M/M, or Edmund toying with MC. So it's a bit all over the place right now.

https://preview.redd.it/c8osb8uu7c0e1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=17dcf3592924fb056802a75b13a84622e0ed3f9a

Some think it's Mi-yeon's manager, others Dong-hyun's father, some say our mock-therapist Dong-hyun, Doo-yeong's father... LOL at the person who said ""The MC"", what a plot twist!! Worthy of Fight Club. Some think it could be a woman, for example the girl from the meet-and-greet, or even Mrs Park!! There's even an option for RK3's manager, or Mr Lee.

I'm currently working on an assignment for my course, and the deadline is looming large ‚Äì it's Monday, January 22nd, and I‚Äôve only got 3 days left to finish the assignment before the Thursday 5:00 PM deadline. To make matters worse, I'm dealing with brain fog from stress, and despite having had two cups of coffee, I can't seem to focus or process the material properly. My mind just feels overloaded, and I‚Äôm finding it really hard to make any progress.

The assignment is based on NP-completeness, specifically focusing on **NP reductions**, and involves a complex **role-assignment problem** where I need to reduce it to another NP-complete problem, such as **Graph Coloring** or **Hamiltonian Cycle**. The complexity of the task is making me feel even more overwhelmed, and I‚Äôm struggling to break down the problem into manageable chunks.

I‚Äôm reaching out to ask: **How do you deal with stress and tight deadlines?** I know this is a common experience for CS students, but I‚Äôd love to hear about specific strategies or techniques that have worked for you in moments like this. How do you clear the mental fog and regain focus when the clock is ticking and the pressure mounts?

Also, for those who have worked on **NP reductions** or similar assignments, any tips on how to approach this kind of problem efficiently would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance ‚Äì I‚Äôm hoping to power through this with a clear head and avoid getting too caught up in the stress. Any advice on managing the workload and staying focused is welcome!",0,1731359022.0,AskComputerScience,0,0.5,False

I‚Äôm fairly new to adaptogens, for reference I have been diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, and depression- and started taking magnesium at night because my anxiety was getting in the way of my sleep schedule.

I saw someone talking about how they like to mix ashwaganda with Rhodiola, so now I ALSO take 250mg Rhodiola along side my morning coffee and mushroom gummy (lions Main, chaga, reishi, turkey tail) and oh my god this combination makes me feel like I‚Äôm on Adderall. I‚Äôm really happy that I found a natural supplement that helps me, because as a full-time college student, I do have a hard time and struggle with motivation- and for such a long time before this, I really had a hard time with finding motivation to do almost anything, but now I feel like I‚Äôm more focused than ever and I‚Äôve been sleeping a lot better as well.

I go to university centre after my morning classes to grab a bite to eat before studying for midterms or to do homework.  Lately, i've seen this girl with brown eyes. Every day last week I see her waiting in line, she moves her legs kind of weird, but it actually gets to me. I don't get it either, it's some sort hop she does.

It's difficult typing this because i'm nervous, but also because my cat keeps turning off the lamp in my room.

She made me too flustered, so I had to change this routine. I didn't have class at around 8am last Thursday, so I decided to go to Dafoe to meet up with friends who just finished their midterms. They were about to watch a movie on Netflix, so I had to hustle to get there and didn't want to be late. I quickly noticed my friends near the couches, so I ran right to them and quickly took out my earbuds from my backpack. As I sat down, lo and behold, it was the girl with the brown eyes! I couldn't believe it, my mind was completely blown! It was so hard to concentrate I stupidly dropped my earbuds on the ground. Maybe it was all the layers I had in the morning or that the heat was turned up at the library, but I suddenly got really hot and sweaty. I didn't have my morning coffee yet, so I was a bit more dazed than normal and also felt like I had bugs in my stomach. My friends thought I was acting weird and wanted to watch already, so I had straighten up and act cool. They were right, I didn't want to waste their time, I just kept telling myself to snap out of it because she really is just a girl I see around a lot. But still, what is this feeling? I don't think i've ever felt this way before.

I have to concentrate on my classes and especially finals - they are coming around the corner. It's just hard to get my mind of things. I do have some friends who are volunteering at a fashion show next week. Maybe that'll take my mind off of this girl.

It‚Äôs not about that. It‚Äôs about leaders who understand that it‚Äôs a system. It‚Äôs about hearing voices and hearing what needs to be done."" (TrekCore)","TREKCORE:

""In Nana Visitor‚Äôs new book, Open a Channel ‚Äî The Women of Star Trek, she weaves together tales from women of every incarnation of Star Trek into a rich tapestry of trials and triumphs. By centering both the characters and the unique women behind the roles, Visitor explores both the history of women characters in Star Trek, and even more deeply the experiences of the women who brought them to life throughout decades of Hollywood and how each era shaped the women who worked and lived through them.
 
We were lucky enough to get a chance to sit down with Visitor ‚Äî who of course portrayed Kira Nerys on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine ‚Äî to talk about the extraordinary experiences she had creating this work and what she learned along the way.

**TREKCORE: Let‚Äôs start from the beginning. Where did the idea come from, and how did you decide to take on such a big challenge? It‚Äôs a really big scope, almost 60 years of Star Trek.**

NANA VISITOR: I have to tell you, I spent most of the time overwhelmed going, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where to start or keep going,‚Äù you know, it was so much. Ben Robinson thought that having a book on the women of Star Trek was a really strong and timely idea, and he came to me and said, ‚ÄúWould you write it? It doesn‚Äôt make sense for a man to write this.‚Äù

And it was originally going to be a page each of all the women, the actors, what they represented, who they were, maybe some kind of representation of them artistically on the other page. And as I started to think about it, and it was mostly, I guess, subconscious, this desire to go, ‚ÄúWait a minute, what about ‚Äî ‚Äù To his credit, he let me go. It wasn‚Äôt the book that it started out to be.

It was supposed to be really what you think of a coffee table book being, but as I started to think about our lives, the decades we were in, what we dealt with as we were projecting this hopeful future, it seemed I couldn‚Äôt see another way to put it down. I thought that was really, really important to say.

**TREKCORE: You brought more of a depth to it, right? Because they‚Äôre not just  characters on a page, there‚Äôs deeper issues at play here.**

VISITOR: And that‚Äôs why Ben was brilliant to go, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not writing this. I need a woman to do this.‚Äù And he trusted me with it.

**TREKCORE: You‚Äôre doing work as a historian too, a deeper history. One of my favorite interviews in the book is the section with the Original Series guest stars. You‚Äôre chronicling not just Star Trek history, but what it was like in Hollywood in general during that time, and you could see the progression of where we were to where we are. What what was it like being a historian in that way?**

VISITOR: I talk about being caught in amber, you know, so much of my thinking was what the culture was at the time that I entered society. I was deeply affected by it and made accommodations for it so that I didn‚Äôt even know certain things that were affecting me and my thoughts and the way I lived my life. So I became aware of that in the people that I interviewed.

I started off thinking, ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs gonna protect the franchise.‚Äù And I certainly wasn‚Äôt looking for anyone to blame. I just wanted to know how it was. Because men are affected by the cultural norms and boxes that they‚Äôre put in too. But I realized it wasn‚Äôt that at all. Some women I saw go, ‚ÄúWait a minute. Yeah. What? What did I used to think?‚Äù And the phrase, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just the way it was,‚Äù which is sort of a hopeless phrase, you know?

What I came away with is we must talk. [laughs] We need to open a channel and have these conversations so that we help lift ourselves out of these ruts of constant pattern thought given to us by somebody else.

[...]

**TREKCORE: One thing I was struck by how kind you were to everyone in the retelling of these stories. You seem to respect how complicated people are; there isn‚Äôt always a hero and a villain in a lot of these tales. How does that perspective inform what you think we should take from these kinds of stories?**

VISITOR: Understanding that we don‚Äôt know where someone comes from and what they‚Äôve been through, and what deals they‚Äôve made with themselves to move forward, that‚Äôs important. So leading with compassion always seems to be a start at the basis of: ‚Äúyou are human‚Äù. They are human, so let‚Äôs go from there.

I have to say, I was so impressed with Brannon Braga because he did a really long interview with me ‚Äî he had no idea how I was gonna write this book or how I was going to bring that narrative in, if I was looking for enemies to blame, and he was so forthcoming and so thoughtful. There is an activist who says, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call people out, call people in.‚Äù And I think that that‚Äôs one of the best things that I can do, is to explain how I got the way I was.

What you rob of a woman when you make her aware of sexuality when it‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre talking about at the moment. When it‚Äôs a workplace, how that hijacks her brain. I don‚Äôt think men know that.

[...]

**TREKCORE: How do you think we help them along ‚Äî people in power in particular ‚Äî go from just paying lip service to it to truly changing things?**

VISITOR: Well, then I‚Äôll go to Mike McMahan, who said, ‚ÄúIf you love a system, keep questioning it. Don‚Äôt just go, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs just the way it is.'‚Äù Things will change when women are all through the hierarchy of power, not just at certain levels ‚Äî and leaders, both men and women who give voice to the people that they‚Äôre working with. Cooperation.

I mean, patriarchy doesn‚Äôt seem to work so well, but neither does matriarchy. It‚Äôs not about that. It‚Äôs about leaders who understand that it‚Äôs a system. When something is true for the smallest thing, it‚Äôs true for the biggest thing, and our bodies rely on all the systems of our bodies being healthy and working together.

A well-oiled machine and that means everything is being cared for and listened to and worked with. So I think to me, that seems to be an answer. And it‚Äôs not about taking power away, it‚Äôs about hearing voices and hearing what needs to be done.

[...]

**TREKCORE: How did you come up with that title? When did you realize that was what this book was about?**

VISITOR: I had this moment with astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti who is just a remarkable human. I was in Germany at ISA, and I had the opportunity to talk to her while she was on the space station ‚Äî she really got a lot of encouragement from Star Trek to become an astronaut, an engineer, and everything else that she does. And while I was talking to her, I watched her bounce her way to the camera to talk to me. I was an actor on a set of a space station and this child watched that, got inspiration, now she‚Äôs in space and I‚Äôm talking to her and saying, ‚ÄúHi, Samantha. It‚Äôs so good to see you again.‚Äù My brain did back flips. It was so huge and overwhelming.

And then I came home, and I went to lunch with Brian Fuller. And I was telling him about my experience, and I was telling him about my struggles with the book and I told him: ‚ÄúThey said, ‚ÄúOpen a channel.‚Äù That was my line. This was for real.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the title of your book.‚Äù

[...]

**TREKCORE: Yes ‚Äî and this book is full of people retelling traumatic events, from little ‚Äút‚Äù trauma to the brave retelling your own personal trauma with a capital ‚ÄúT.‚Äù How do you view the importance of recounting these things that we usually try to avoid talking about directly?**

VISITOR: I recently did a TEDx talk at Space Force. And I had young women and men come up to me and be in tears and say, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù You know, France is going through this moment and it‚Äôs kind of wonderful. There‚Äôs this famous trial going on about rape and they are saying the shame is on the wrong person. It‚Äôs not ours, it‚Äôs theirs.

And to realize that we have shame about it, but it‚Äôs human. This is human experience. My mother would always say something, great: ‚ÄúIf it happened, you can talk about it.‚Äù I‚Äôve noticed is how it takes shame away from somebody else and keeping it in this dark place.

The moment you start talking about it, it absolutely sheds light ‚Äî and once that shame is gone, we have all kinds of energy and mind possibilities to project in other ways, not in keeping us hidden.

**TREKCORE: This book does a lot of that, for people who might not be aware that these things are so common, and the experience of so many people around them. I want men to read this book as much as women.**

VISITOR: You know the men that have read it have responded in a really interesting, positive way. Dominic Keating read it and was like, ‚ÄúIt makes me thoughtful about what we did on Enterprise. It makes me think about how I‚Äôve been.‚Äù

In relationships, one-on-one, the therapist will teach you to say, not, ‚ÄúYou did this. You did that,‚Äù but, ‚ÄúWhen this happened, I felt this,‚Äù because then you can be heard ‚Äî instead of the other person shutting down and will freeze, won‚Äôt hear it because it‚Äôs too scary. But if they can understand your feelings, maybe they can hear you. It‚Äôs not an easy process. It‚Äôs not an easy process to do but that‚Äôs a direction that we can start to take.

**TREKCORE: Open the channel?**

VISITOR: Open the channel.""

Purly coincidence that on the 10th there was going to be a Bday party happening and I missed it. 

All the merchandise on show was in a separate building/annex, but damn was it extensive. The downstairs area had hundreds of Figurines, and the upstairs had more artwork. The clubroom was mostly set up as in the anime. There was a coffee shop in the annex that had a few trinkets I had never seen before, as well as some Ton-chan melon pan that I seem to not have taken a pic of.

Longtime lurker here. I‚Äôve been drinking K-cup coffee every single day for the last 4 years even though I absolutely hate it. I told myself the longer I drink this coffee, the more time I have to save some money for a quality espresso machine. My experience drinking espresso and milk based drinks is only once a week at a local barista on the weekends. Even though I enjoy espresso by itself, my daily preference will be to drink milk based drinks. I drink 2 cups coffee a day.

I‚Äôve shortlisted two machines right now based on a lot of reading.

Machine 1: Breville Oracle Jet ($2000) comes with a built in improved Baratza grinder and has a lot of neat features that would make someone like a beginner (me) make espresso and milk based drinks easily. It has thermojet system means that it has very less start up time, so even though it can't get espresso and steam milk at the same time, I think overall time may not be a big deal for me.

Machine 2: Niche Zero grinder & Lelit Bianca v3 (Cost $3600), This obviously beats the above set up in terms of grinder and variability and might be an endgame set up for most people but it costs $1600 more than the setup above. This has significant startup time (24 mins) due to its boiler set up and can be effectively be handled by using a smart plug. But after the startup, you can make drinks very easily. Based on the threads here, it has so many customizations that you can do a lot more with your espresso shots.

Now my questions for you is

1. I am really getting daunted by the number of things I have to keep track of and a lot of things on Lelit. Is the learning curve easy? How long will it take me to make an appropriate espresso drink that I will enjoy?
2. How marginal of a difference will I find the espresso coming from both machines? I may not even find the difference on day 1, but what about 1 year from now, 2 years from now? Will the second setup make considerably better espresso that I'll find the difference so quickly?
3. How's the customer support for both machines? As Lelit is from Europe, I am afraid any repairs are going to be harder, is that true?
4. The problems noted here about Breville are its poor grinder, do you think the grinder problem is largely gone away with the Oracle Jet as they claim its a much better grinder?",3,1731358056.0,espresso,4,0.8,False

Then she mentioned that she was with the guy she is seeing so we postponed to today. She left a couple of friends behind on the walk home to have coffee with me. She drank her coffee slowly and overall I think she enjoyed the conversation and so did I. We also walked back home afterwards and she only brought ip the guy she was seeing once and quickly changed the subject. 

Am I wrong for assuming she might be into me? It just seemed like there were no obvious clues for her liking me in a relationship kind of way. But the fact that she went to those lengths to talk to me seems like she might like me. 

Am I going insane or should I try to make a move in some way?

### Background
This one is totally new to me, having never run anything from InnovPharm before.  I recently picked up MVPre 3.0 and will be running it for the first time today.

### Label (2/5)
The tub design is pretty bland, but it looks professional and gets the job done.

The formula is a proprietary blend.  Since the dosages are mostly hidden, there‚Äôs not much to talk about here.  We‚Äôll have to go by feel, but with caffeine, DMHA and eria jarensis on the menu this shit better hit.

### Taste/Mixability (4/5)
The flavor is Gusher Blast.  Excellent mixing with no residue left over.  This flavor is well above average especially for a high stim hitter.  The taste reminded me of strawberry lemonade and was very enjoyable.  Nothing chemical or bitter. 

### Effects (1/5)
20 minutes in and the energy starts to build, along with some good mood elevation.  No beta tingles.  Unfortunately that‚Äôs where this one leveled off.  I started my workout at around the 60 minute mark.  Today is moderately heavy rack pulls for volume (sets of ten at 405lbs from below the knee).  

Focus was good, I stayed on pace with my sets, but totally lacking the energy, euphoria and increased work capacity that usually accompanies DMHA.  It honestly felt like I took a Panda pre.  Disappointing. 

Pumps were good.  I finished up with back and bi accessories.  Biceps and back got noticeably fuller and skin felt tight.  I felt like the increased blood flow helped me push out some extra reps here.

Two hours post workout and no crash yet.  Still good energy and positive mood.

### Cost (4/5)
I picked this one up on the NutriCartel Labor Day sale for $39.  That works out to $1.95 ‚Äúper the go.‚Äù  Points for a good price.

### Overall (1/5)
I‚Äôm calling this one bunk.  It felt like a good daily driver.  Some solid mood elevation, which is probably just down to the eria jarensis.  Good pumps. Overall a waste of a high stim day.  I won‚Äôt be using it again.  Already gave the tub to a buddy.

I would recommend Zeus or Kilo Labs Supreme V1 as a better light/intro DMHA hitters instead.  For high stim non-illicits I get more out of Ninja Up or the regular HyperMax-3D.",4,1731357728.0,Preworkoutsupplements,3,0.84,False

It started off with noticing that he doesn't treat me as respectfully as he treats his coworkers

Then I noticed he was spending a lot of time (and a little bit of money - lunches, coffee, donuts) on (what appears to be) a platonic, but overly emotionally attached, relationship with his young female assistant 

I confronted him about her, and he says he likes being with his coworkers because his ""true self"" which is a completely different personality than the one I've ever seen. He says he hid this side of himself from me but has been this way for decades just didn't want me to know because he knew I didn't like his behavior, language, or types of media he likes to consume

I feel stupid not to have noticed, though now that he explained it, I realized there were little glimpses of this throughout our marriage but I considered them out of place ""oh maybe he's tired, been a long trip.""

I've got one foot out the door, except that I don't want 50% custody, and would rather ride it out till kiddo graduates, but I'm struggling with how to keep the peace knowing that my husband has chosen to adopt personality traits that offend me and has chosen to take on hobbies that he knows I don't like  or physically can't do

I was diagnosed in August. I started taking strattera which didn‚Äôt seem to do much. I felt calmer and was overthinking things a bit less, but that could be related to therapy.

This is my 4th day on adderall and I feel like crap. I have a headache, didn‚Äôt experience the ‚Äúquiet‚Äù that people describe, still flustered, and my anxiety feels increased. I know my dose is probably too low. Should I call my psychiatrist and tell her its not working or should I wait until our next appointment in a month? Should I consider going back to straterra?

Lease Takeover Details: My current lease of a 1BR/1BA Apt with a Balcony at The Sonnet runs through May 12, 2025. Unfortunately, I need to move out before then. This situation provides you a 5-month housing option that would be perfect to trial an incredible apartment/neighborhood before signing a longer lease or provide short term housing through the spring.

Once approved through the Sonnet‚Äôs simple application process ($50 application fee) you would take over the lease through 5/12/25 at the current rent. The new tenant would be eligible to re-sign with The Sonnet then (likely with a lower rental renewal rate vs what is available to new applicants) or transition on from this unit at the end of the lease, penalty free. 

The Apt Details: 1 Bed, 1 Bath, w/ Balcony (on the Top floor with balconies available), walk in closet, floor to ceiling windows, stainless steel appliances, W/D and dishwasher in unit. Rent is $2,950 per month. Parking is available in the building as an add-on. Pet friendly apt and building.

Building Details: The Sonnet is an amazing, luxury apartment building I am truly sad to be leaving. 24/7 concierge and package/guest mgmt., rooftop with grills, fire pits, and an infinity pool (overlooking monuments), gym, pet spa & dog park, coffee in lobby, friendly neighbors, location central to all 14th and U Streets have to offer.

i (23m) have a coffee maker. it's a little old, around 6y? for the most part, it functions perfectly. the only thing it doesn't do anymore is that the ""auto off"" feature no longer works. 

how it *used* to work is that it would, as expected, turn off after making a cup. i know this because i used to leave it on. eventually it just stopped working. don't know why, but no biggie. after a couple months of it not working, i just turned the feature off. no reason to have it on if it doesn't work after all.

i don't mind if anyone else uses my coffee maker- truthfully, i don't (why would i?). and i tell any company we have that they are more than welcome to use it- but just to please turn it off when they're done. 

*this* is where the problem arises: my family (2 older sisters and parents) however seem to have...some sort of issue with it? i *have* explained that the auto-off feature *does not work,* and have even *demonstrated* to my parents that it will just...stay on. i have explained it more than once, too. but every time i mention it i am met with the *same* answer every time- ""there's an auto off feature, just turn it on"". i then tell them it stopped working so i turned it off after a while. and then the conversation either turns cyclical, or they just get sort of...weird and almost shut down or completely change the subject immediately? they get a little passive aggressive on rare occasions, but for the most part they just totally brush me off. it's largely my parents. this sort of thing is really unusual for my sisters and i don't think it's them, save for maybe my oldest sister leaving it on sometimes? 

i'm never aggressive about it at all, i have not and would not ***ever*** raise my voice or get aggressive/confrontational about. it's always really casual. it's a fucking *coffee maker,* i *know* it's not that big of a deal. it *is* true that on occasion i'll leave a note just letting people know it won't turn off and to please turn it off when done, usually when it's company who haven't stayed over before and thus wouldn't know, but once again i try *incredibly* hard to make sure it comes off as genuine- because it is. i *am* autistic, so i know i can struggle with tone and i give my full effort into making sure i compensate for that. 

...but it makes me feel like i'm fucking crazy. the way that the conversation goes the same way *every* time. the fact that both of my parents have *seen* it not shut off when the feature is *visibly turned on*. i don't know why it's something that they seem to really don't get? i *want* to, though. i *want* to know what it is they're resistant to, to be able to try and quell and concerns or clarify any confusions they have. but it always just goes back to them pretending i never said anything *immediately.* this is not a new thing- it has been an occasional happening for *years.* it's not every day, but it is something that's happened intermittently and i've noticed it happening a bit more frequently as of late. i feel like i'm being fucking gaslit.

i know there will be one question asked, so i'm going to answer it here- there's 2 reasons i would like it turned off when not in use:

\- the first being that it's just not good for electronics to be left on all the time for no reason, so it helps the coffee maker ""live"" a little longer so to say. my dad in particular *knows* this- he built *computers* for a living and has worked with technology his entire life. he's one of the most tech savvy people i've ever seen, so i *know* he understands this part at *least.*

*-* the second one is a bit bigger: we have an old house with some quirks. the relevant one being that certain kitchen appliances cannot be used at the same time or it will blow a fuse. it tends to be smaller ones- the kettle, microwave, coffee maker, etc. on their own they're fine, but for example you can't run the kettle and coffee maker simultaneously. it's the heat that causes the issues we think. ...so a coffee maker that's *constantly* on, heating water, is gonna cause an issue sooner or later. it's an easy fix and most of us know how to fix it, but it's really easy to avoid as well.

here's why i might be TA:

\- i *know* it's a super small thing and it's not a big deal. i *know* that my coffee maker will not explode and stop working if it's left on for a few hours every now and then. i just want to preserve it as best i can. but i know that i might be making a mountain out of a molehill and should just shut up and turn it off without saying a word.

\- i know part of the reason it's making me so anxious is that it's hitting personal wounds. i've been infantilized, treated like i don't know anything, like i'm stupid, irrational, and unreasonable by an overwhelming majority of people in my life. not my sisters- i'm really close to them, and i feel like they're the only ones that fully *get* me in a lot of ways. but parents, other family members, ex friends and ex partners, even teachers and school staff during my grade school years. it's hitting nerves and sensitive spots and i *know* that.

\- my memory is...tricky. i've got some problems that can make it blurry and muddied, and i know things blend together for me. i've got a very complicated mental health history and i know sometimes that can really mess with my head. my own mind betrays me, and in this situation i can't even tell if there's anything to this or if my own issues are making me feel like this, but in reality *i'm* the one who's making me feel this way? 

i'm not even mad. i'm just confused, and admittedly feeling...ambiguously scared. i don't know why, or of what, but it's something i've been thinking about a lot today and i think i just need some outsider opinions. i don't even feel *super* strongly about it most times? it just seems like everyone else around me does and i don't know why.

tldr: coffee maker doesn't turn off on it's own, i try my best to politely ask people to turn it off after they're done so it doesn't just stay on, family doesn't understand why i don't use a feature that they know doesn't work on it anymore, and it's starting to make me doubt myself.",2,1731356611.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

1gp1tvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1gp1tvf/datv_spoilers_all_i_love_it_and_hate_it_at_the/,"[DATV SPOILERS ALL]  I love it and hate it at the same time. Pros and cons, full review ","Hey fellow DA fans! I‚Äôve been a Dragon Age fan for a long time, and after finishing *Dragon Age: Veilguard*, I wanted to share some thoughts. There‚Äôs a lot to love, but also some aspects that didn‚Äôt sit right with me. Here‚Äôs my breakdown on what *Veilguard* does well, where it falls short, and why it sometimes doesn‚Äôt feel as ‚ÄúDragon Age‚Äù as I‚Äôd hoped.

I played as human female mage Gray Warden. 

**Pros:**

* Beautiful graphics and immersive environments
* Extensive customization options and character creation
* Fast and fun combat with diverse builds and equipment
* Solid voice acting and cinematic experience
* The final mission sequence is epic and memorable

**Cons:**

* Missing core characters and unresolved lore threads (where‚Äôs Merrill, Fenris, red lyrium? Hawke? HOF? Tevinter Slaves?)
* Simplified faction dynamics and world politics, or basically... non existent? 
* Limited replayability and overly linear progression
* Lack of moral complexity in choices and bland companions
* Corporate-sounding dialogue undercuts emotional depth
* Disappointingly shallow romances
* A rushed and unsatisfying epilogue
* Rook feels predefined, limiting role-playing potential
* Lack of moral conflict within factions
* Missing core Dragon Age themes of fighting against oppression and lore breaking
* The  main theme song and whole soundtrack sounds pretty generic. I miss the feeling from DAO theme or Trespasser 

# The High Points

1. **Graphics, Exploration, and Combat** *Veilguard* is visually stunning, with detailed lighting, shadows, and an atmospheric vibe that feels like a treat. Exploring Tevinter‚Äôs slums or Treviso‚Äôs rooftops is engaging, with statues and chests hidden in spots that require a bit of puzzle-solving. The combat system, though action-oriented, works well. It‚Äôs fast, fluid, and diverse, with plenty of room for experimentation across various builds and items. Having a wardrobe and customizable equipment makes character progression feel rewarding.
2. **Final Mission** The final mission is one of the game‚Äôs best aspects. It‚Äôs grand and well-executed, bringing all of the game‚Äôs stakes to a cinematic climax. This segment feels like it had the team‚Äôs full creative energy and is one of the most memorable parts of the experience.
3. **Voice Acting & Cinematics** The voice acting across the board is excellent. It brings a sense of depth to the cast, and though the writing sometimes falters (more on that later), the actors do an amazing job. Combined with the game‚Äôs polished cinematics, *Veilguard* feels like a visual and auditory feast.
4. **Character Creation and Customization** Finally, a character creator with real variety! From hairstyles to lighting options and a preview setup, you can craft a version of Rook that feels unique and personal. The wardrobe system is a great touch too, allowing customization that adds to immersion.

  
For a generic, fantasy RPG it is great. But... 



# The Low Points

1. **Missing Characters and Unresolved Lore** Set in Tevinter, *Veilguard* had huge potential for lore and character cameos. Yet, key characters like Fenris (who has ties to Tevinter) and Merrill (a blood mage AND eluvian expert) are nowhere to be seen. Additionally, the red lyrium storyline, which was central in *Inquisition*, is oddly absent despite its past importance. Where are the elven agents of Solas? Why are the Gods choosing Venetori and Antaam, not trying to convince elves to join?  Ignoring these threads makes the world feel strangely disconnected from previous games. The cameos we get are so underdeveloped, it is almost rude. 
2. **Shallow Faction Dynamics** *Veilguard* introduces six factions, each with potential for complex, morally charged storylines. Unfortunately, they come across as superficial and disconnected from established lore:
   * **Shadow Dragons**: Lack any missions related to opposing mage supremacy or the system of slavery.
   * **Antivan Crows**: Renowned for stealth, yet are mostly just seen fighting head-on.
   * **Veil Jumpers**: Allegedly tied to Dalish culture, but no strong lore connects them. Were they supposed to be Solas's agents?
   * **Grey Wardens**: Closest to their established lore 
   * **Lords of Fortune**: Essentially an excuse for arena battles, with little depth.
   * **Mourn Watch**: Nevarra fell flat
3. **Companion Depth and Romance** *Veilguard‚Äôs* companions lack the emotional texture that made those in past games memorable. They all tend to be blandly agreeable, and Rook has no option to challenge them. This lack of complexity makes them feel less like real people and more like passive sidekicks.  Rook always agrees with them, and they in return always agree with Rook. In previous games companions could leave or even attack you if the approval was too low.  And that felt real.  I would not have expected Solas to be my favourite character to talk in DAV. Solas has a somewhat compelling dynamic with Rook, and finally they can challenge each other.     Romance options also fall flat. Where previous DA games had in-depth romances, *Veilguard* feels shallow. Previous romances could in some cases even influence the main plot or even change the outcome of the end. In DAV we get 15 min of coffee talk. (quick search on youtube shows DAI had around 1 h of romance content per companion)  The romance is so bad in DAV that i think I would rather have none and just adopt all companions as their mother, because I was playing mom with them anyway. 
4. **Sterile Writing and ‚ÄúHR-Friendly‚Äù Dialogue** As mentioned above, the game‚Äôs dialogue often has a sanitized, corporate feel that makes it less engaging. Rook feels overly agreeable, with few moments to genuinely challenge NPCs or make morally complex choices. Past protagonists could take darker paths, make controversial choices, and even risk breaking relationships with companions. Here, the dialogue feels safe and ultimately less immersive.
5. **Limited Replayability and Linear Story Progression** The game‚Äôs linear progression is restrictive. After one playthrough, there‚Äôs little incentive to replay other than minor faction-related dialogue changes. This isn‚Äôt the replayable, branch-filled narrative we expect from the DA series, and it feels less rewarding to return to.
6. **Lack of Core Dragon Age Themes** A staple of Dragon Age has been exploring conflicts between characters and oppressive systems‚Äîthe Chantry‚Äôs hold on society, the Templar‚Äôs control of mages, dwarven caste systems, and elven oppression. Here, these themes are absent, and even Tevinter‚Äôs mage supremacy feels softened. There‚Äôs no Chantry-versus-mage conflict, and Tevinter‚Äôs racism is barely acknowledged. It‚Äôs like the grittier core of Dragon Age was polished away, making the setting feel unfamiliar.
7. **Rushed Epilogue** After a stellar final mission, the epilogue feels almost perfunctory. The conclusion is brief and doesn‚Äôt give the sense of resolution we‚Äôve come to expect. Past games took time to show the impact of our choices and give closure to companion storylines, but *Veilguard* doesn‚Äôt offer that satisfaction.
8. **Rook Feels Predefined but Motivation Feels Undefined**  While the customization of Rook‚Äôs appearance is great, their personality feels  predefined to an extent that limits role-playing. The problem with Rook is that we never truly understand their motivation. We‚Äôre thrown into the story during a bar fight, and the only information we get is that Rook is Varric‚Äôs second-in-command. But who *is* Rook? How did they become a Grey Warden? Did they escape a Mage Circle, or have some other past that influences their actions? While the customization options for their appearance are fantastic, Rook's personality and motivations are more difficult to grasp. Much like Hawke, Rook has a specific character, but their decisions and interactions often feel flat and unseasoned‚Äîalmost like the Inquisitor. Unlike past protagonists, Rook‚Äôs choices and conversations lack the depth and impact that make their character feel unique or personal.
9. **No Political and Social Dynamics** Past DA games built tension through politics, moral choices, and systemic oppression, which are largely absent here. I read somewhere a comment where a gamer pointed out the potential if factions had to navigate cultural conflicts, such as the Grey Wardens needing to kill the last living titan or the Veil Jumpers clashing with Mortalitasi over sacred artifacts. The lack of real, conflicting stakes makes *Veilguard* feel more like a surface-level adventure than a true Dragon Age journey. 

# Final Thoughts

As someone who‚Äôs been gaming for over 25 years, I can see the hard work the developers poured into this game. But it feels like Bioware‚Äôs veteran writers and developers, who‚Äôve historically crafted intricate, emotionally rich worlds, weren‚Äôt given the space to let *Veilguard* truly shine. *Veilguard* took 10 years of development, but with EA‚Äôs resources, it feels like it could‚Äôve been even better.

Looking at *Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3* and how Larian Studios has captured the hearts of fans by focusing on player choice and narrative depth, it‚Äôs clear that giving developers room to breathe can lead to amazing results. *Veilguard* has moments of greatness, but it falls short of what could‚Äôve been a true Dragon Age classic.

I want to love this game, I really do. 

I‚Äôd love to hear what other fans think‚Äîwhat did you all enjoy (or not) about *Veilguard*?",6,1731355905.0,dragonage,3,0.88,False

I (35f) met my boyfriend (32m) (let's call him Walter) in June of 2022 through my job. I am a paralegal, and he is an attorney, and the firm we worked for had an office in Kentucky and then another in Colorado. He lived in Colorado and I in Kentucky. When we first met, it was very professional, just seeing each other on our weekly Zoom office meetings. In this time, he was broken up with by his long-term girlfriend, let's call her Gigi because she will come up again. After the break-up, he did rebound with another girl, let's call her Heather. This relationship fizzled after a couple of months, just due to lack of compatibility and most likely because Walter was rebounding. Walter and Heather were officially broken up by late November of 2022. 

I have been married previously, and my ex-husband was and is an alcoholic, we were together for 7 1/2 years. His mother was a huge reason for our divorce and how controlling and overbearing she was, on top of his sister doing the same thing. My dating history was very similar to Walters for 2022. I dated someone long-term (9 months) and in the beginning of the year April/May, we broke up due to him cheating (I have been cheated on by almost everyone I've dated long-term). After that I was single until August, when I dated a guy until October we parted ways in a respectful manner. After that, I was single and planned to stay that way to focus on myself. 

Walter, slid into my dm's on IG in late November 2022 ..... mind you, I had ZERO idea he was seeing someone else. He said I posted a ""thirst trap"" but in fact it was a picture of my face, and I was biting my lip, but I had used this photo for other instances, for promoting my music (I am also a musician). I thought Walter was cute, so we did strike up conversation, where I quickly mentioned that I am in NO WAY ready to date anyone. He said he was in the same boat, and since we lived so far apart, we agreed that a friendship could be harmless. 

In January 2023, we Facetimed for the first time and were both really smitten. I had planned a trip to Colorado for April 2023 to visit a friend, and Walter offered for me to stay with him. Initially, I declined, but after a couple of months of growing closer, I agreed. We spent five days together, and by the end of the trip, we both realized we were in love. From then on, we were dating long-distance.

Long-distance dating was tough, but we made it work. I set strong boundaries about loyalty, trust, and honesty. Walter knew I had a history of being hurt in relationships and that I wouldn‚Äôt tolerate dishonesty or anything that felt like cheating. We visited each other every six weeks, stayed in constant contact, and I felt genuinely happy for the first time in years.

Flash forward to October of 2023. At this point, we had been dating long distance for six months, on top of talking and getting to know each other for four months before that. In this time, the only boundary that Walter broke, was exchanging numbers with a female to make a plan to hang out, just the two of them . . . I quickly told him that I was not okay with that, because it was a date. I did also mention that if he was going to exchange numbers, I would too, as I had refrained from doing so. He SAID he cancelled the plan; I still don't know to this date if he actually did, and that he deleted her number and he said he didn't friend her on social media. So, in October, Walter confesses to me that he feels like he needs to go get put on an antidepressant. I have been taking medication since I was 13 so naturally, we talked about this in detail. The medication he was given had strict, no drinking instructions. One day while he was hanging out with friends, he called me, and we talked for thirty minutes because he said he was so nervous that they were going to a brewery and that if he had a drink, it may make him unable to drive and everything else. I told him that having ONE drink was probably not an issue and that if he felt a certain way, I am sure a friend would take him home. He agreed and I was so thankful for his honesty and the conversation. We get off the phone. That evening he sends me pictures of the event that the friends did before going to the brewery, and low and behold, he has a beer in his hand. Which means, he called me and had that 30-minute conversation with me but he had already been drinking. Meaning, he lied to me. About alcohol. Which means, he has a problem, and you can say what you chose here, but if you have to lie about your drinking, it's most likely because you have an issue. I naturally was very upset and actually told Walter that we had to break up, he knew that lying to me was not okay but also about alcohol specifically, and I was triggered and had to end it. During this conversation, he admitted to not only having alcoholism but a variety of other addictions to substances that I had been completely unaware of the whole time. Had I known, the relationship would have never made it a day. He said he needed rehab and said he didn't want to lose me. I've been here before with others, but this seemed different. I offered to help him find a place and honestly, I had no clue what I would do at that point. I mean, we had been discussing me relocating to Colorado so we could be together and now that seemed like it was shattered in my mind. He went to rehab the very next day, for thirty days. This was HARD. I stayed through the process to support him and as I noticed he was more enthusiastic everyday about sobriety it did bring me some sense of hope, like maybe I went through what I did, so I could be here for him (ugh what a thought right?). Prior to him going into rehab, I had been applying for jobs in Colorado. During his last two weeks, I got a job offer. A really, really lucrative job offer. The deal I made with myself was that I would not move unless I could financially take care of myself with my salary. 

I will say, moving to Colorado sounded great. I LOVE mountains and outdoor activities, so it seemed like a paradise to me. During Walter's last week of rehab, I decided, I would move to Colorado and take the job. 

When I moved out, it seemed like all hell started to break loose. The list below simplifies the things that happened in chronological order (not all bad), to bring you up to date:

\-Move to Colorado in December 2023

\-Boyfriends parents and brother are at the apartment and have begun cleaning the whole place, since my bf was not much of a housekeeper. Spend the holidays - and my birthday - with his family and him and my first time away from my parents in Kentucky. 

\-Begin new Job in January 2024.

\-Late January 2024, find out the bf is liking a TON of pics of women in thongs, bikinis, ass showing, tits out, pics. (I am not upset with any woman he has liked, let's make that clear, I don't disparage those women for being proud of their bodies). One woman in particular is someone who he sees often in court, so this was disturbing for me. Another woman was an ex. Another woman was a friends ex gf. The rest were IG models but knowing there were three that were people he spoke to regularly, this was disturbing. He knew this was a boundary. 

\-Early February, find out that bf has slid into other women's dm's when he was NOT sober and when I lived in KY. 

\-March, find out that the very lucrative position I had was being terminated, due to the firm I worked for closing completely. I honestly didn't know at this point if I would stay in CO. (I had used most of my savings to move, so moving back to KY seemed a little trickier).

\-Early April, bf deletes all of social media (and not the women he follows on there). To show me that he doesn't want to hurt my feelings. My thought was that I would prefer him to delete the women, but I'll take what I can get. 

\-Late April, we visit my family in KY. It was a good trip, but during this time, my bf and I were looking at a place to potentially purchase, in CO. 

\-Late April, bf agrees to couples therapy so we can navigate our way through what has happened, even though he did break my trust in ways, I was willing to work on the relationship and rebuild that trust. Deciding to stay in CO and buy the townhouse together.

\-Mid-May - we move to our townhouse. 

\-End of May - find out bf had been liking an OnlyFans model on IG and every single picture she posted where she was advertising her page. This WAS before he deactivated the social media, however, he wasn't honest about it when I asked, ""if there was anything else"".

\-June, boyfriend flat our lies to me about if he followed the girl who he exchanged numbers with and made plans with and ""cancelled"" later. He had been friends with her the whole time. Which is why I think he never cancelled those plans and maybe lied to me. 

By this time, I am literally losing my shit. I feel like I've made this big move for the man of my dreams who doesn't actually exist and now I am working a job that I absolutely HATE and took a $15K a year pay cut just to make sure I had a job. (I am still working at this job and still miserable).

\-Late June, I visit KY by myself. During this time, Walter does things that he doesn't normally do (go to the bar with friends until late while he's sober, etc) and this made me worry, as I've been with addicts before and was weary of him falling off the wagon. He didn't, but this obviously caused issues since we were still working on trust. 

\-Early-Mid July - I am crying and suicidal, daily. I finally ask him to take me to the hospital because I simply can't get out of the funk by myself.  I end up signing myself up for a 72 hour hold and going to a mental hospital. While in the hospital, I was happy again. Feeling like I had friends and was able to regroup finally. 

\-Out of the hospital. I am doing better, but still not completely okay. 

Since the hospital, I have done my best to ignore the small things that bother me. Like when his phone goes off in the middle of the night, I try to just chalk it up to his snapchat or email or something. I truly believe my bf is honest and not TRYING to cheat on me, just a weak man who is struggling with temptation on all fronts. We have been doing great for the past two-three months. Bringing us to present. 

My boyfriend's parents come for the first time since we purchased our place. I cleaned profusely for two weeks since they were staying with us. I wanted to ensure they had the most comfortable stay possible and that they didn't have to lift a finger (like when they were visiting in December) and could just relax and enjoy the time with their sons (his brother also stayed with us) and just have a good time away from home. 

My boyfriend's mom however, immediately started to redecorate my house. At one point she said, ""I moved the big pot to another place, I hope this is okay"" and I replied, no actually we use that often and that is why it's stored where I have it. I then told her that little things didn't bother me, but if she completely started to move or redecorate, I would be very upset and triggered. I even told my bf that she was moving things, and it was stressing me out and if he could ask her to please not do that. Which he did. 

I have gotten along with his parents from day one. I love them dearly and know that they typically mean well and are not acting with malicious intent. However, one morning while my bf and I were asleep, his mother reorganized my whole kitchen. My kitchen is my sanctuary. I love cooking and baking and during this miserable time in CO, this is where I have found solace the most. She moved EVERYTHING. All the things I use regularly were moved to places that were hard to reach and the stuff I barely use was accessible. because this is how she wanted it to be. She didn't ask, she didn't care that we asked her not to, she just did it. In my mind, this is INCREDIBLY rude. She does NOT do this at his brother's house, and she does NOT do this at her siblings' homes or friends' homes. So, her doing this at my home literally just sent me off. I went to bed and didn't come out until the next day. My former mother-in-law used to come and tell me how my house was not organized to her liking and move things around, my ex-husband never defended me, and it was always them against me. I was so triggered that I hyperventilated myself to sleep, even while medicated. I felt as if I traded my life in KY that I did enjoy, to come and experience what I experienced in my marriage. Things that Walter knew going in would bother me if they happened and assured me many times they wouldn't. 

My bf is also stating that now he must make amends with his ex-gf Gigi, because she was the one who gave him the first ultimatum of getting sober. Like, wants to sit down and have coffee with her. This is the same woman who cried when he was 90 days sober once upon a time ""because he was never going to drink again"". I am the one who got him into rehab, I am the one who has sat alone in our home with no friends around while he attends AA and supports that every step of the way, I am the one who promoted him to go to AA when he was out of rehab instead of just doing nothing, I am the one who uprooted my life to be here with him as a support system (all of his family lives out of state) because he said he was nervous he didn't have that, I am the one who has dealt with his addict behavior for the past (almost) two years and yet, I seem to be forgotten in all of this. 

This morning, I told him that I think I may have to break up. I'm not sure how this is going to work if he thinks that I am thankless in this scenario and everyone else is who he should be thanking and making amends with. As if, I had zero part in this. 

Not to mention, he told me that his mom moving everything around wasn't a big deal and that I could just move it back. Y'all, this woman rearranged my WHOLE kitchen. This is going to take me several hours to undo. 

Now, I‚Äôm considering going back to Kentucky. I miss my support system! I feel like I‚Äôve done so much for him, but I‚Äôm losing myself in the process.

Am I wrong for wanting to move back home? Am I overreacting about my kitchen? Am I justified in feeling this way given everything that‚Äôs happened?

I appreciate any advice or kind words. Thanks for reading",2,1731355809.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,0.74,False
