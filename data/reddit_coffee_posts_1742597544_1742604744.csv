1jgwfz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/chat/comments/1jgwfz4/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1742604663.0,chat,0,1.0,False

Note I was already vegetarian, but ate a lot of eggs and butter and cheese and whole milk. My first measure was unfasted, most recent one fasted. 

- completely quit egg yolks, switched to egg whites
- no more whole milk for coffee, soy milk instead 
- generally switched to toast with peanut butter for breakfast
- more nuts
- oatmeal several times per week. I substitute it for pasta or rice and make like a savory bowl
- even more beans 💪 
- started supplementing 6g fiber, and fish oil

I just want some advice/ideas about what happened to me last night. 2 days before this happened I had unprotected sex and it hurts so we stopped after like 10mins. I also drink coffee everyday so idk if that may have contributed to this.
Last night I peed like usual, but then I was confused when I feel like peeing again but nothing comes out. It hurts when I try to force it. My bladder pressure continued the whole night and it was horrible since I felt like peeing the whole time. I was constantly drinking water to flush out my system, and I pee normally but the bladder pressure is still there. I immediatly presumed that it might be UTI.
But today I feel like it hurts less than last night and the feeling of bladder pressure is mild.

Did I just got a symptom of UTI? I'm a bit anxious last night cause I can't go to the doctor until Wednesday, is it okay to prolong this? Do water really heal this kind of symptom?",1,1742604418.0,WomensHealth,0,1.0,False
1jgwcwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/1jgwcwn/arguing_semantics/,Arguing semantics,"Deleted my previous post because some rando decided to argue with me over semantics. 
I don’t think boycotts have to be perfect, but we can all try our best.

In my opinion:
Product of Canada should be something 100% made in Canada, using Canadian ingredients, labour, and packaging. This is the gold standard of what to look for.

Made in Canada should be the next thing to look for, but this doesn’t guarantee that it doesn’t have American ownership. Research ownership.

Prepared in Canada is shady, as I have seen several products with this claim with American companies behind them.

Best practices in my opinion, other than looking for Products of Canada at your grocery store:

- Instead of shopping at Costco or Walmart, shop at a Canadian owned grocery store.

- Shop at farmer’s markets if you have access to one. 

- Grow your own fruits & vegetables if you have space, time, & the energy to do so.

- Bake if you have the energy & time.

- Learn how to cook and meal prep.

- Support your local bakers, butchers, candy makers, coffee roasters, cheese makers, craft brewers, farmers, fishers, jam makers, restaurants, soap makers, etc. 

Other points:

- Doing some research, I’ve just found out that Jamieson Laboratories which is headquartered in Windsor, Ontario, is partially owned by an American private equity investment firm, CCMP Capital. Fortunately, I’ve found a lot of supplement companies are based in Canada, so I don’t have a shortage when it comes to made in Canada supplements and vitamins. 

- Instead of Amazon, try spreading out your purchases between your grocery store and other Canadian places & there are several Canadian streaming services.

- Instead of Starbucks or Tim Hortons, try your locally owned or Canadian chain coffee shop. 

- If you’re disabled or low income, you get a pass from me.
Absolutely do what you need to do, and if that means buying American discounted food or using Amazon, I think that’s fine.",1,1742604403.0,BuyCanadian,1,1.0,False

I'm sitting here staring at my screen, feeling like I just got punched in the gut. Need to vent and maybe get some advice from those who've been there.

So, I've been freelancing as a web dev for a few years now. Mostly building MVPs for startup. Usually, it's great. I love seeing founders' eyes light up when their vision comes to life.

But this last project? Total disaster.

Got a referral for this startup. Small team, cool idea. They needed an MVP for a subscription platform with some fancy analytics. We agreed on $5k - $2k upfront, $3k at launch. I busted my ass for 5 weeks straight. Barely slept, lived on coffee and pizza. Delivered exactly what they wanted, on time.

Then boom. Their main investor pulled out. The whole thing collapsed overnight. No launch, no final $3k.

I know they're not scammers. They paid what they could. But I'm still out three grand I was counting on for rent and some much-needed gear upgrades. Hell, I even turned down other work to meet their deadline.

Now I'm left with a GitHub repo full of code no one will ever use and a gnawing feeling in my stomach. I keep second-guessing myself. Should I have seen this coming? Am I an idiot for trusting startups?

I know it's part of the game, but damn, it hurts. How do you all deal with setbacks like this? Any tips for bouncing back?

I still love building MVPs and working with startups, but right now, I'm questioning everything. If anyone's got advice - or better yet, a project that won't vanish into thin air - I'm all ears. My portfolio's solid, and I'm ready to dive into something new. Just need a win to shake off this funk.

It’s something Peter and Aunt May tackle in different ways (hence Otto as the villain) but also, I feel this is an opportunity to finally give us the MJ from the Lee and Romita run, burst on energy who is so fun and excitable but can’t admit to herself that she is struggling. 

Peter is a teacher at ESU, just next to the Coffee Bean where new trainee Mary Jane Watson works, getting a job since moving to New York with her Aunt Anna after leaving New Jersey.

This is just as much an MJ story as it is for Peter. Her growth into loving someone for her true self and not just her party persona is something not to be shied away from but also I feel she’s not that party girl anymore, in between stage of masking her trauma but not as exaggerated.

I feel the opening scene needs to represent Peter’s longing for love but his desire to hide behind his mask to show that he doesn’t “need” it. I’d like to see the villains we haven’t seen in between TASM2-NWH to appear and fight Peter like Shocker, Vulture, Grizzly and so on. There’s a reason for this trust me.

I made a script that I’ll link bellow which explores these themes and characters more so.

I have family members with this mental disorder and suspect I'm heading down this path, or I've been on this path for several years but didn't know it. A lot of things are coming together. I've had a lot of weird phases like I have never considered myself religious but in high school I was obsessed with new age culty stuff online and got sucked into it for a few years. I also read and sang hymns as a compulsion for my pure O-OCD I was struggling with at the time. It was weird to have those thoughts and compulsions since I don't associate with any religion. I thought for many years the house was haunted. It of course wasn't but the thought plagued me. I thought I was demonically possessed, I thought if I did certain things like if I wear a certain colour of socks or underwear it will impact my day somehow. I still have that superstition, I get it with coffee mugs, socks, etc. It's been hard not to wander onto tangents as well. The words either take a detour and I go off track, or there are no words.

This month my mental health has become severe. I'm getting memories, dreams and reality mixed up especially in the morning. I wake up in the morning disoriented sometimes in a dream-like stupor. I'm forgetful, I have no motivation to take care of myself, and my mood yoyos between severely depressed for a long time, numb/completely blank, or this frantic surge of energy like desperation or something that makes my heart race. Earlier today I saw there was cheap housing available but in another province far away from where I live and it sent me into this frantic episode where I was shaking, my heart racing, and this suffocating desperate NEED to go there, like my life depended on it.

**READ:** [**Freeze of Duterte's assets under study**](https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/03/22/news/freeze-of-dutertes-assets-under-study/2077889)

THE Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) is considering freezing the assets of former president Rodrigo Duterte, following his arrest and detention by the International Criminal Court (ICC). Earlier this week, Presidential Communications Office Undersecretary Claire Castro said the AMLC would determine its course of action if the ICC requests a freeze on Duterte's assets. AMLC Chairman and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Eli Remolona Jr. told The Times that such a move ""is not simple legally."" Under Republic Act 9160, or the Anti-Money Laundering Act, the council can request the Court of Appeals to issue a freeze order if it finds probable cause that a financial asset such as money or property is linked to unlawful activities. In July last year, former senator Antonio Trillanes IV filed plunder complaints against Duterte and Sen. Bong Go before the Department of Justice over the alleged irregular awarding of 184 government contracts worth more than 6 billion pesos.

PRESIDENTIAL Communications Office (PCO) Secretary Jay Ruiz on Friday called on Congress to pass laws aligning the country's content moderation on social media with international standards. Speaking at the House of Representatives Tri-Committee's inquiry into fake news, Ruiz proposed adopting the European Union's Digital Services Act as a model for curbing online disinformation, hate speech and harmful content while protecting free speech. He said many social media platforms, including TikTok and YouTube, do not have local offices in the Philippines, making content moderation and enforcement slow and ineffective.

A LAWYER accredited by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Friday refuted claims that former president Rodrigo Duterte's arrest was ""warrantless,"" stressing that it was done in full compliance with Philippine law and international statutes. In a press briefing in Malacañang, Joel Butuyan said the validity of the implementation of the arrest warrant is based on Republic Act (RA) 9851 (An Act Defining and Penalizing Crimes Against International Humanitarian Law, Genocide and Other Crimes Against Humanity) and the Rome Statute.

MALACAÑANG on Friday said the government will appeal the decision of a Timor-Leste court denying the extradition of former Negros Oriental representative Arnolfo Teves Jr. Palace Press Officer Claire Castro said during a press briefing the government was ""surprised"" at the Timor-Leste Court of Appeals' ""adverse ruling"" overturning its December 2024 decision approving Teves' extradition. Castro said the Department of Justice (DOJ) will file the appeal. The Philippine government has submitted all necessary evidence and legal documents to support the extradition request, including proof that the Philippines has no active death penalty in place, she said. The appellate court ruled that there was a well-founded risk that Teves would be subjected to torture, inhuman, degrading or cruel treatment, once he is brought back to the Philippines.

Over to business, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) will likely resume lowering interest rates next month despite the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) decision to pause anew, Metrobank Research said. In a commentary on Friday, Metrobank maintained its view that the central bank will deliver a 25-bp (basis point) cut at next month's Monetary Board meeting to support economic growth amid target-consistent inflation. The US central bank on Wednesday kept the federal funds rate at 4.25 to 4.50 percent, marking the second straight pause since January after cutting rates by 100 bps last year.

WITH Choco Mucho and Akari already in the final four, favored teams Creamline and ZUS Coffee will also seek to make the semifinals of the Premier Volleyball League (PVL) All-Filipino Conference on Saturday at the Ynares Center in Antipolo City. Having a 1-0 lead in the short best-of-three quarterfinals series, Creamline and Zus Coffee will gun for repeat victories against Chery Tiggo and Petro Gazz, respectively, to advance. Creamline, the defending champion, displayed a high-caliber performance in Game 1 as it swept Chery Tiggo, 25-10, 27-25, 25-21, last March 18. In that game, Alyssa Valdez flaunted her vintage form after leading the Cool Smashers with her 16-point outing on a 64 percent attacking efficiency, while Jeanette Panaga added 10 points. Despite the advantage, Creamline head coach Sherwin Meneses wants his team to play Game 2 with their backs on the wall.

1jgw4wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1jgw4wg/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1742603729.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False

Sometimes it feels positional but then always comes back. I went to my PCP first and he said it's costochondritis, which I've had episode of since late December and more recently in mid-February, particularly on my left side. 

I also went to the ER and the ER doctor did chest X ray, ECG and blood work which all came back perfect. She diagnosed me with gastric GERD and thinks the the antibiotic pill may have irritated my esophagus but she doesn't think it's still stuck inside or caused a hole or lesion or anything. She gave me 40mg pantoprazole for 4-8 weeks and that's it... also almost 24 hrs later I developed constant heartburn and left chest soreness, also have this throbbing pain feeling all down my throat and like shortness of breath/not getting enough air (even though my oxygen capacity was 99%). Eating or drinking anything is still painful but I guess not as sharp as the first day? It is just torture still 48 hours in this :((( Feels like something is still stuck in my esophagus even though I have been able to keep food down well and no blood in mouth or anything..

I'm honestly still in pain 48 hours later and so scared and confused what to believe. I'm gonna take the PPI (even though I read horrible things about them). I also want to add that I've had 0 GERD symptoms or issues in my life, and I drank like coffee like 3x a day for yearsss until mid-February when I stopped bc my anxiety has gotten out of control and led to many panic attacks. 

Anyone has an opinion on whether it's costochondritis or GERD? Should I go back to my PCP to ask for endoscopy? Or any other medication that can help heal a potential ulcer  in the esophagus if it truly is esophagitis? ",2,1742603289.0,costochondritis,0,1.0,False

# DeLonghi Nespresso ​2025: Which Machine Reigns Supreme? (Review‍ &​ Comparison)

Are you a ‍coffee aficionado⁢ dreaming of barista-quality espresso from the comfort of⁢ your own home? Or perhaps ⁤you're ‍simply⁢ seeking a convenient, no-fuss way to kickstart your mornings? The world of ‍single-serve coffee machines is vast, but DeLonghi ​Nespresso machines stand ‍out for their blend of stylish design, ease of use, and, ⁣most importantly, exceptional coffee. This comprehensive guide, updated for 2025, delves ​into the DeLonghi Nespresso universe, helping you ‍navigate the various models and find the‍ perfect machine to match your taste⁣ and lifestyle.

**Why Choose⁣ a DeLonghi Nespresso Machine?**

DeLonghi, a‍ trusted name in home appliances, ⁢partners⁢ wiht Nespresso to‍ create sleek, efficient machines that deliver consistently delicious coffee using Nespresso's innovative pod system.The DeLonghi Nespresso collaboration brings together ⁢Italian⁢ design flair with Swiss precision, resulting in ‌a winning ‌combination for ⁤coffee lovers. Whether you're an existing ‌Nespresso ‌user looking ‍to upgrade ⁣or⁢ a newcomer intrigued by the system, ‍understanding the nuances of each ⁤DeLonghi Nespresso machine is key ⁣to making an informed ⁣decision.

**Understanding the ⁤Nespresso System: A Primer⁤ for New ​Users**

For those unfamiliar with the nespresso system,it's​ essentially a single-serve coffee brewing method that utilizes pre-packaged,hermetically sealed coffee pods. These pods contain‌ ground coffee,carefully selected and roasted to deliver optimal​ flavor. Nespresso machines ​pierce the pod​ and force hot water through it under​ high pressure, extracting a rich, ‌aromatic espresso or coffee beverage. the spent pod is then automatically ejected into an internal⁢ container, ⁣making cleanup a ⁣breeze. One of ⁣the ⁣advantages is minimal mess,⁢ ensuring a rapid ⁤and simple brewing experience.

The Nespresso system is ‌divided into two main ‍lines: OriginalLine and VertuoLine. OriginalLine machines are designed for espresso-based‍ drinks,⁢ while VertuoLine ⁢machines can brew both espresso ‌and ⁤larger cup⁣ sizes⁢ of coffee, offering more versatility. Each line uses different types of pods and brewing technologies. Understanding ⁢the differences between original and vertuo‍ is key for consumers.

**DeLonghi Nespresso models: A Comparative Overview**

Let's examine some of the most popular DeLonghi ​Nespresso models⁤ available ‌in 2025,⁣ highlighting their features, benefits, and ideal user profiles. We'll cover a range, from the compact options ‌to ⁤those with ​integrated milk frothing capabilities.

https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/s/IGIw2s5bsM

The weekend crawled. Minutes stretched into hours. By Sunday night, sleep became impossible. Anxiety and hope battled in my chest as I tossed in bed, managing maybe three or four hours before giving up at 5 AM.

I was dressed and ready by 7. My mother came to wake me as usual, surprise crossing her face when she found me already up. I left for college early, claiming some assignment needed finishing.

I was first to enter the lecture hall, taking my usual seat and watching the door. Students trickled in, each one causing me to tense until finally she appeared. My heart hammered against my ribs.

Would she notice me? Ignore me? Pretend Friday never happened?

She walked directly to my row and took the seat right in front of me. Before sitting, she smiled and said, ""Hi.""

One syllable. Two letters. It changed everything.

Throughout the lecture, I heard nothing. The professor's voice became background noise to the simple fact that Maya had chosen to sit near me. If called on, I would have stared blankly, unable to recall what class I was even in.

This became our pattern for days. Each morning, a smile. A ""hi."" The seat in front. No conversation beyond that, but it felt like something important was building in the silence.

Then one day as the lecture ended, she turned around in her seat.

""Let's have lunch together.""

Words failed me. My mouth opened but nothing came out. I nodded instead, afraid to break whatever spell had brought this moment into existence.

Soon it became routine – lunch with her friends and mine, all at one table. I found my voice eventually, joining conversations, making jokes. All while watching Maya from the corner of my eye. She seemed happier, but sometimes I caught a distant look crossing her face. Whatever had made her cry that day still lingered. She kept busy, perhaps to outrun her thoughts.

Two months passed like this. Group lunches. Casual conversations. Each day gathering tiny fragments of courage until one afternoon, I finally assembled enough to speak the words I'd been rehearsing.

""Would you like to get coffee after class?""

My feet shook beneath me. My palms turned damp. Rejection I could handle – what terrified me was losing our fragile routine of hellos.

""Yeah, why not,"" she said, then added, ""Who else is going?""

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(28+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/OxamSqG)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

1jgvori,https://i.redd.it/7sisginnv4qe1.jpeg,A few items + recipes,"I’m working on Buy it For Life + Less Ingredients + Less Plastic + Less Consumerism. 

My goal isn’t perfection but trying with things I consume the most of. 

Here’s a few items I’ve bought + some recipes for extra flair:

- Chemex 8 cup coffee maker (49.00 @ Williams Sonoma). Bought due to not wanting a plastic coffee maker. I also use it to make homemade almond milk. 

- Glass Milk Bottle (no idea on cost have had it for years). Stores homemade almond milk 

- Cheesecloth bag (no idea on cost have had them for years). You can use as coffee filter and nut milk filter

- Vitamix Blender (around 400 @ Williams Sonoma). I have dreams for the stainless steel blending container but it’s 200.00 extra dollars (less microplastics)

- Maytag Commercial Washer and Dryer ($1,500 for both including a 400.00 rebate from gas company for buying gas dryer)

Recipes:

Nutmilk - 7.5 cups water + 1 cup raw almonds (salt, sugar, vanilla depending on taste - I always add salt). Blend all ingredients in blender. Set milk bag in Chemex and strain through. I take the almond meal and put it in my smoothies the next few days. 

Homemade Protein Powder - I take about 1/3 cup of each and grind in a coffee grinder:
-flax seed
-hemp seed
-pepitas (green pumpkin seeds)
-raw unsweetened coconut chips 

Mix together and add a sweetener of choice (I add vanilla when I blend and add aforementioned almond meal if I’ve made milk recently. 

This stuff really doesn’t take much more time out of my day and it’s very calming for me to know what I’m putting in my body when it comes to my daily “staples”. 

Enjoy!

**Step one:**

- 1oz espresso (something citrussy, using a light-medium roast washed and patio dried Nicaragua Dipilto Monte Libano), 
- 1.5oz citrus forward gin (using Bluecoat American Gin) 
- 1 dash lemon bitters. 

Wet shake until ice cold and strain into a Collins glass. Top with around 4oz tonic (using fever tree). I added fresh ice after to help cut the foam, leaving space for the next step. 

**Step two:**

- 1oz heavy whipping cream
- 0.5oz lemon oleo saccharum. 

Reverse dry shake, and then add on top. 

The result: a wonderfully lemony coffee cocktail.

I’m 26 and from the eastern US. Like everyone else here, I’m hoping to meet some new people! Ideally, I’d love to connect with someone who enjoys real conversations and wants to form a genuine connection. I crave that, and honestly, it’s been far too long since I’ve had it!

I like to think that I’m a pretty easygoing and talkative person, especially when I click with someone. I have a naturally optimistic, glass half full outlook on life. Unless we’re talking about coffee, in which case my cup is always half empty and I absolutely need of a refill. Sarcasm is practically a second language for me lol. But at the end of the day, I’m just someone who loves getting to know and spend time with those around me. 

When it comes to hobbies and interests, I have a ton, and I’m always open to learning about something new! I certainly don’t think we need to have all of the same interests. I absolutely love urban exploring (I have some many pictures of places I’ve visited) and road trips. If it involves discovering new places, you can count me in. I also have a huge fascination with genealogy and history in general. Historical architecture holds a special place in my heart. I love to learn, in every capacity. 

I’m also a big sports fan! Football and hockey are my favorites, but I can definitely appreciate a good game no matter the sport. I have been wanting to get into UFC more as well. It’s so fun to watch, but I know next to nothing about it currently. Maybe you can help me if it’s something you like? When I’m not out exploring or watching a game, I love being in the great outdoors (when the weather cooperates, of course). I like camping, hiking, kayaking, and basically anything else outside. Thank goodness that the weather is finally starting to look up!

I will admit that I’m a homebody most of the time. I love to curl up with a good book and just relax. However, I will admit I’ve been slacking on the reading recently. Pleaseeee feel free to give me suggestions. If I’m not reading, I’m probably watching a movie/TV. Some of my favorites are Star Wars, Harry Potter, Interstellar, Psycho, Black Mirror, The Twilight Zone, Breaking Bad, OITNB, and Shameless. I also have a mild obsession with houseplants (and trying desperately to keep them alive lol). I love baking, but by no means am I an expert. I like some video games, but I haven’t played in a while as I have somewhat lost interest. Although, I’m always down to watch someone else play and get way too invested in their game hahaha

Anyways, I’ve rambled for far too long. If anything I’ve said resonates with you, please reach out! I’d absolutely love to talk and get to know you. If not, I hope you find what you’re looking for!

1jgvmks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jgvmks/stomach_pain/,Stomach pain,"Hello! 

So I have the type of anxiety where my stomach will start hurting and the urge to go to the bathroom is like crazy.

I've been to gastrologists, I've been to two different therapists, and I've told my doctor. I was told it was probably IBS, after they tried all the tests they could including colonscopy and endoscopy, but they havent officially diagnosed me and the medication they give me doesn't work. Fiber doesnt work. Nothing is helping me with these panic attacks I get. 

Because I don't panic until I feel that urge to go. The cramping of my stomach and the diarrhea that needs to urgently come out.

I've tried breathing, which works 1 in 10 times, and I've tried the 5 senses rule. I've tried talking to keep myself occupied. Nothing works.

I feel like Im going to explode from the inside. I have to exhale dramatically sometimes because it gets too much. I need a bathroom and sometimes it's not always there which freaks me out even more. I immediately go walking because I can't just stand still and sitting makes it worse. 

It's 50/50 chance that when I do reach a bathroom, I will use it. Panic doesn't go away when I do unless it's alot. If I don't use it, it won't leave me alone until I reached my destination or I'm home. I spend about an hour everyday on the toilet because it does eventually come out if I have something there and if nothing comes out, it reassures me that I'm empty. But if it's too early, like 3 am to 7 am, I am not reassured at all. It's too early to have a bowel movement and spending an hour on the toilet won't work in those hours.

 I have woken at 5 once, spent a very long time waiting on the toilet but nothing came out, went outside, and as soon as I stopped at a bus stop my stomach was hurting and I had to use it really bad. I panicked and walked back and forward because moving helps me but it wouldn't go away so I ended up breaking down. I spent an hour and 20 minutes in agony of stomach pain, the urge to use the bathroom, and the feeling of needing to breathe more until I eventually got up and went back home. As soon as I got home and went on the toilet, absolutely nothing came out. 

It happens if it's too early in the morning. I say 95% of the time it happens if I'm outside before 10 am. The remaining time is if I eat alot or I eat something spicy or greasy and I go outside immediately after. It always happens when I'm outside or when I'm home and someone's in the bathroom at the moment. It is ruining my life, I have so many events that require me to be early. I hate letting everyone down. 

I tried dieting in January. I thought it worked but just 2 days ago I had an attack again and I started crying. I had the urge to run and I was just nearly seconds away from screaming at the bus driver to let me off. It didn't go away even when I arrived at my doctors appointment at 9:30 am. Stomach kept cramping and I kept running to use the bathroom but I was still nervous because I couldn't spend my time in there because patients would need it for urine samples.

So I know the reason behind them. I'm terrified of soiling myself. The humiliation, shame, and the stares would be horrifying. It'll never leave me alone. And I hate when people tell me to just let it happen. It won't make it all go away. I am seriously considering adult diapers. At 23 years old. 

I'll add somethings that might or might not be relevant: I used to be terrified of toilets growing up. I would soil myself at home because of how scared I was. I would also have many bowel movements that were hard as stone and huge. I was told it was because I didn't drink enough water.

I have some aunts and a grandparent with issues of panic attacks. None of them have the urge to use the bathroom though.

This all started from food poisoning when I was 19. I ate everything my siblings ate except for this Dunkin Donuts Coffee. I believe that's what made me sick because I spent an entire week in agony with urges to go and stomach pain. I went to a doctor and I forgot what he told me but I recieved no help.

I just need some advice. What has worked for anyone with a similar issue? Should I try anxiety meds? I have no support and my therapist and Doctors just tell me to eat better but that's what I've been doing!!

Next time I will use less sugar since I don't love it with too much sugar... Also I will wait for it to cool down before trying to move it into a plate (yeah, that's the reason why the photo is such a mess XD).",3,1742601816.0,Breadit,1,1.0,False

I am black mixed raced with Caribbean heritage. I am quite isolated from my culture and my family are christians and rastas, so i can not ask them for help with this. In the past i have tried reki- it is not for me i had bad experiences and candle magic. I habe felt drawn to hoodoo and feel it is my roots. Recently I meet up with an old 'friend' that I have not seen in a long time, she is white and into reki and other celtic spiritualities. 
Through her in my early adulthood I had my first encounter with being attacked by a white women, I didn't know anything then so I called on my dad to help me and he did. 
The witch women bumped into my 'friend' recently. My 'friend' has a friend who told her there were entities lingering. I felt off about the reconnection and knew I wanted to pull away from her, she told me how her friend had grabbed something lingering and blew it away. While telling me this she grabbed above my head moved it too her solar plexus and blew with her other hand. I gave her a stare, I was shocked. 
Since she dropped me back home we have not spoken and I feel she has blocked me because she knew I knew what she was trying to do. I burnt sage. Since that day I have felt like something is in my home. My child has been scratched in the night and today I watched my coffee cup slide off the counter and smash on the floor. 
I'm not scared like I was in my youth but I don't have very much experience. I need to get rid of this. Before I met up with her I had ordered some protection and firewall oil and cleansing oil, and a bunch of candles. 
Can someone please give me a bit of advice as to how to go about this. 

I hope this is OK to post

I added 2 beans per cup of raw sugar. Grade A oily beans from India.

Removed the vanilla seeds from the pod and then added them to the sugar.

Let it sit for a month. Smelt good but when I added to my coffee, I just couldn't taste the vanilla.

Then I removed the beans, chopped them and grinded them in my grinder with some sugar.

Added that back into my original batch and let it sit for 2 days.

Although the vanilla smell became much more intense, I just cannot taste vanilla in my coffee.

It was a cushy corporate job (my first) that took me months to get in the first place. I have bad OCD and GAD and it played a part in my termination due to my work suffering. While unemployed, I was depressed and barely leaving my bed. I was staying up till 5AM and then would sleep anywhere from 2pm to 5PM. 

One day in mid February, I got a massive headache (I get migraines so not that crazy) and couldn’t sleep. The headache went but I then went four days with no sleep till I ended in the ER. I was put on Hydroxyzine. It was barely effective, and I got 1-2 hours a night. After about two weeks, I woke up to the sun shining into my room. I live in a rainy region so I don’t see the sun often. It felt nice and I just felt better. From then on, end of February to early March, my sleep was normal and I hopped off the hydroxyzine. 

The victory was short lived. After blissful sleep for 2-3 weeks, one night, while lying down, I felt like I couldn’t breathe. Panicked, I went to ER, and since then, my sleep has been terrible. I think a factor of this recent insomnia bout was I was worried if I fell asleep,my throat would close up. 

I got a blood panel done recently. I’ve actually had blood drawn twice within the last month so not sure if that means anything. I wasn’t donating but I was getting checked. While everything was fine, my cholesterol is absolutely trash, like really really bad, to the point where if I don’t change it, I’m gonna have heart disease in 5-10 years. That was a massive wake up call.  I was recently sent to a psychiatrist and with my history of mental illnesses, my sleep is being summed up as a symptom of severe health anxiety. 

Idk why I would be anemic. I eat terribly but I do eat red meat. I will say I was a coffee addict during the winter, having 3-4 cups a day. My breathing isn’t great but my doctor said my cholesterol wouldn’t be causing  symptoms at this level yet. For how I may sound in this post, I don’t feel super anxious right now. Im currently working part time as a house painter (lol I know big change). I’m working on the health but does anyone have similar stories with the insomnia. My sleep is incredibly fragmented. I’ve gone 48 hours awake followed by a crash of 3-5 hours. I’m getting anywhere from 2-5 hours a night, depending on meds. Funny enough, the best sleep I’ve gotten in the last month was getting drunk on St Patrick’s day and crashing for 8-10 hours. Any advice appreciated if this would worth looking into.

Not a warm morning shower. Not that first sip of a fresh, steaming cup of coffee in the quiet peace of your kitchen. Not watching the sun creep up the horizon and cast soft shadows across buildings in the distance. By far, the best way to greet the new day is briskly rolling down the alley, grinning ear to ear, and shouting “HELLO WORLD!!” with a simple push, then listening to the dawn chorus echo back until it builds to a symphony. With that single sonorous note, you’ve affirmed your presence. You’ve become a part of the world again by contributing to its heartbeat.


A gentle honk is the stitch that weaves together the very fabric of our community. I love seeing my neighbor every morning through the alley-facing window, pumping their fist in solidarity. Face contorted with raw emotion, passionately mouthing something (I think it’s “hell yeah brother!!”). I just wish they could know that I’m holding space to hear them (honking) too.


Related, but any folks here know of any local pro-honking charities that could use some extra hands? Happy to help out wherever I can. Just want to do something for the local community on an issue I really believe in.

Except we have one type of coffee mug which is an Irish coffee mug and we serve all our lattes and cappuccinos in that. (Don’t ask me why- it’s an Italian restaurant under new ownership nothing makes sense to me.) I try my best to make these drinks but it’s not perfect. 

I can steam milk *fine* but I would love to be able to steam milk properly for lattes and cappuccinos. Latte art can come later. I’ve watched videos and practice when I can but I can never get it exactly right. 

We have steaming pitchers here which I use to steam the milk, and I’ve been practicing pouring my milk in our small soup bowls which are similar to a wide latte/cappuccino mug (rather than pouring in the small Irish coffee mugs) and when I pour my milk it’s either all foam straight away, or when I swirl it around and tap it I get just milk and no foam even at the end. 

I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong. I also can’t ask anyone to teach me as no one here knows. I’m in grad school so I won’t die if I don’t figure this out but I’d like to if I ever work at a cafe. I have a nespresso at home and an automatic milk frother- it’s not the same as a steam wand but it gives me what I need and I’d love to one day own a machine with a steam wand. 

Any help appreciated! What cappuccino milk looks like vs latte milk, videos you recommend, pouring advice, etc. 

Thanks! 

EDIT: ok so I guess I *can* steam milk for lattes and cappuccinos.. I just can’t pour it “right” (if that makes sense) for cappuccinos. For lattes it’s been fairly ok for me, but with cappuccinos I’m not sure how to pour to allow more foam. ",5,1742600281.0,barista,10,0.86,False

That night he went on to find me on instagram and follow me. A few months passed and I saw him again and he had the light touches and I caught him staring at me across the room several times. I ended up texting him later and sending him some photos from the day that he might want and told him it was great to see him again and that I hoped to see him again soon. He responded and said it was always great to see me and that was it. I’m shy so I thought this was kind of my way of showing a little interest. 

About two weeks later, he started interacting with my Instagram stories. Sliding up with reaction emojis and liking my stories every few weeks- ranging from events I was at, accomplishments and a pretty photo of me. We don’t really have any kind of relationship at all and barely know each other so not sure why he was going out of his way to interact like this.   I have since interacted with a couple of his stories as well. This has been going on now for a few months. My birthday recently passed and he DM’d me a birthday message in response to my story. I tried to initiate a conversation in response by asking how he’s been and mentioning it’s been a while and he responded and asked me back and when I responded he did not keep the conversation going at all or even acknowledge my response. 

I actually really am interested in him and really felt a lot of chemistry the two times we were in person. I am confused by him continuing to interact with me on instagram though and never take things even far enough to a conversation. Why keep going out of your way to interact with me when you’re not interested? Do you think he could be interested? Or is he just friendly? Should I suggest we meet up for coffee or a drink?

1jguhnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/1jguhnd/guide_to_maximizing_canadian_tire_triangle_rewards/,Guide to Maximizing Canadian Tire Triangle Rewards,"I couldn't find a comprehensive guide to explain how to get started with Triangle Rewards without wasting time and offers trying to figure it out.  
  
This isn't an ad or anything, this is just an extensive guide for people that might be new to Triangle Rewards, because it's honestly a little intimidating and confusing at first. But being that it's a fully Canadian store I'd like to help some people out that might not understand because it's hard to find good info online because it's niche, and everyone on Reddit says since Canadian Tire is often overpriced it's tough to shop there.

Sorry for the length of this post.

First, Canadian Tire is the type of store you go to *first* before you head to other places. Pick up the things that you have bonus offers for and can get cheaper than other places, or things you can't find elsewhere. They have some amazing Canadian brands in-store that are really not found on a national level anywhere else.

Second, sign up for Triangle Rewards, and if you can you should apply for the Triangle World Elite Mastercard. If you really don't think you'll qualify for it (you'd be surprised), there's a lower tier Mastercard you can go for, but I'd suggest just trying for the World Elite (no fee) and worst case just apply to the regular one if you can't qualify. Consecutive credit checks like that are just rolled into one.

\_\_\_

So for starts, the base Triangle Rewards is only 0.4% for every dollar spent. So spend $100 you get back a whopping 40 cents. Everything in the rewards marketing is based off of this 0.4% base. And it's important to know that all the ""multipliers"" are additive, not multiplicative. I'll explain as I show examples here:

When you go into the Canadian Tire Triangle App, you'll get what's called ""offers"" which is similar to the PC rewards kind of. You'll see something like 20x points on garbage bags or 10x points on coffee, maybe 5x on storage bins. Most have a long list of items that are included, but just so I don't have to type it out let's use garbage bags as an example.

20x on garbage bags is (20 x 0.4%) = 8% back. So if you are bulk buying garbage bags, and spend $100 you will get $8 back instead of 40 cents. Not bad, but still might not be as good as garbage bags elsewhere.

If you get the World Elite Mastercard from them, it gives you 10x base reward points. So instead of 0.4% (40 cents / 100 dollars) you get 10x that, so 4% (4 dollars / 100 dollars).

So to explain what I meant by additive and multiplicative, 20x on garbage bags while using the Mastercard WILL NOT be 20 x 10 x 0.4, I wish. But it's (0.4 x 20) + (0.4 x 10) or 8% + 4% = 12% off. This isn't bad at all.

\_\_\_

So when you go into the app you can select a bunch of these offers to find what items you can get for >10% off which is generally in line or cheaper on lots of items elsewhere, but on top of that they often have other bonuses like ""Spend $150 and get $25 CT Money back"" or something. Then there's also the 5 cents back per litre on regular gas + 1.2 cents /L back in Petro Points which can convert back to CT Money. Effectively you get 6.2 cents back in Triangle Rewards per litre back. There's very few premium fee cards that exceed this. Works at CT Gas Bars and Petro Stations.

Finally, there's the Triangle Select program which is a little bit of a tougher sell for most people. On the surface it sounds kind of shitty, it costs $90+tax for a year, first year you get a $50 gift card back. But what it does is adds another 10x back in Triangle Rewards (4%).

So with this in mind, those garbage bags are now 8% + 4% + 4% (16%) off. Most people will tell you to pay off that $90 you'll need to spend $2250 a year at CT just to break even. So it's only effective for people that shop there a ton. This is true, but there is one thing that affects this a lot and it's if you like Canadian Tire (and Mark's/Sport Chek) house brands.  
  
I happen to like a lot of these:

# Apparel

* Denver Hayes
* FWD
* Helly Hansen*\** (*Not sure if this will continue, brand sold to US unfortunately*)
* Ripzone
* Shambhala

# Automotive

* MotoMaster
* SIMONIZ
* SIMONIZ PLATINUM

# Sports & Rec

* Sherwood
* Woods

# Tools & Hardware

* Mastercraft
* MAXIMUM

# Outdoor Living

* Golfgreen
* Vermont Castings

# Home

* CANVAS
* FRANK
* PADERNO
* Petco
* Premier
* type A
* Vida (by PADERNO)

Buying a house brand item adds an additional 20x Rewards. So say those garbage bags were Franks brand now its 8% + 4% + 4% + 8% = 24% off. Some of their house brand stuff, like outdoor equipment, hand tools, cutting boards, water bottles, all that sort of thing are not especially over priced to begin with, and give a huge bonus back if you catch the deals. You can greatly reduce your normal grocery and household item bills.

\_\_\_

That's all in addition to the spend X amount to get X amount back days, and ever week or 2 you'll probably get a gas bonus too, where you fill like 30L and get $4 back (on top of your regular rewards).

On top of all of that, if you can get the World Elite card you also get free roadside assistance that you can put on yourself for any vehicle you're in, or on a vehicle and whoever is driving it. That roadside assistance card also gets you 10% off a Marks.

And finally, you also will gain access to the Canadian Tire Bank, which is like a pseudo bank account that lets you pay utility bills (manually, not automatically) and get 1% back in CT Money. Should also note the World Elite version also gets 3% back in CT money on groceries, which is pretty decent for a free, easily obtainable credit card. Doesn't include Walmart or Costco in the 3%, but should work at Giant Tiger. 1% on everything else.

\_\_\_

**So TLDR Quick Guide to CT Bonuses:**

**Base points** **0.4%**. When you see **5x, 10x, 20x** etc that means it's **0.4 multiplied by that to get the percent** **back in CT reward money**.

**Triangle World Elite** version gets 10x base (**4%**). + 5 cents / L in CT Money gas (+1.2% in Petro Points, sign up for Petro separately).

**Triangle Select** ($90/y) gets **additional** 10x base (**4%**) + 20x (**8%**) **on house brands**

Make sure you use the app! If you don't see a good offer in your app, check the swaps tab. You can swap up to 3 of your useless offers with the community offers each week before new offers refresh. Click swap, select the one you want, and select which of your offers you want to exchange for it. I don't recommend clicking to 'activate all rewards' unless you're actually using them all because then you won't have any to swap. I usually click them on things that are already on sale before I head to the grocery store, or as I'm walking around and see something in person and check for an offer.

I felt nostalgic because we did get along great and I thought that it’s likely she fixed her bad habits, so I texted her and we’re talking again now and it’s like we hadn’t stopped being friends! But mostly, she makes me be more sociable again, which I desperately needed.

I’m usually very lonely, I pretty much only hang out with my best friend from childhood with whom I always do the same things: we only ever go have a coffee in town + shopping once in a while and that’s it because she doesn’t like to go out much — especially at night, and since I don’t really have anyone else, I also don’t go out. I do have a group of friends I’m in touch with but they all started having kids around the same time so they’re busy, I’m the only one who’s single, my friends do activities with their partners etc, so my life has been incredibly boring. BUT since I reconnected with my friend, we already went out to a restaurant, we went for drinks, she came over to my place for dinner, we hung out at her place, we went to a St Patrick concert in a pub, we’re travelling somewhere for the day tomorrow… it’s so fucking refreshing. Usually, whenever I read about upcoming events, I don’t really have anyone to show as I know my best friend would be lazy to go anywhere, but now I do! And she’s always looking for things to do, she wants to travel, we already have plans for the summer, etc. Ahhhh :)

Narita -> Mt.Fuji  
After a long flight we just wanted to get our bearings and went to a nearby park with free parking. Ended up at **Chiba Port Park** and it was soo beautiful and serene. Big open park and can walk to the water, and there were a few food stalls and a cafe. Super windy so if traveling in colder season wear thick jackets and you can shelter in a nearby building in the park (what we did lol). We then stopped at 7/11 and made our way to Mt. Fuji. We made a stop at **Roadside Station Hachioji Taiyama** to use the restroom. There was produce, snacks and a little restaurant inside. Overall took 3 hours to get to our hotel. Super easy to miss exits and get stuck in traffic.  
\- we stayed at **Kumonoue Fuji Hotel** and it was beautiful. It was snowing when we got there so the view was still breathtaking and perfect for the onsen on the balcony. Beautiful, clean and spacious room. The next day the snow was super thick and they suggested we wait till they clear the road, so they let us stay longer without charge. 

Mt. Fuji -> Hakone  
In the morning we got Curry plates from Family Mart in Mt. Fuji. With the snow and the heat of the curry it was a perfect breakfast. We made a stop at the **Mt. Fuji cookie store**, if you're in the area I recommend getting here than at the airport. They had different flavors and varieties of boxed sets to buy. Also know, due to snow and it being a Sunday a lot of stores in the town were closed. We stopped by **FujiQ Highland** to eat. Rides were closed due to the snow but indoor activities, food stalls and stores were still open. We stopped by the **Don Quijote in Kawaguchiko** for quick shopping. Was much better than shopping in the crowded Shibuya Mega Don. We stayed at **Senkei Hotel**, very traditional hotel. Staff was elder but very accommodating and few of the staff spoke english. Very friendly and the vibe was peaceful. It truly felt like you were away from the fast pace of cities and just every day life. We first did a standard room and then the room with the onsen, both were great. They also hold your car keys, they park it for you but since the parking is small they shuffle the cars around if a guest is leaving and a car is blocking. Surprised us at first but made it easy. By 7pm a lot of restaurants and stores close so just had to mindful of that. But of course faithful family mart was nearby. Took an hour to get from Mt. Fuji to Hakone, we just stopped by places so lasted the whole day and got to Senkei by night.

Hakone  
We did the **Hakone Ropeway** first thing in the morning. If you get there right at 9am when they open it was very clear. Barely people around. Parking was only 1,000 yen. Side note, the guards have two orange cats that stay around them and they're so cute to see. This is all at **Togendai station**, our starting point. We went up the ropeway to **Owakudani**, tried the curry bun and black eggs, and did fast shopping. It got super crowded by 10:30am. We then went up to **Sounzan station** and saw the sulfur steams coming from the craters. So awesome to view. We did some small shopping and soaked our feet in the hot bath. It's small so we did it for 5 minutes before getting out so other people could try. Beautiful view from this station too. On our way back down to togendai station, we noticed traffic buildups for both Souzan and Owakudani from 11am-12pm. So if driving I guess be mindful of that or just start from one of the stations early in the morning. We also checked out the **geo museum at Owakudani**. The restaurant in Togendai was also really good, and if you get the dish with wasabi, know your brain will literally be itched and you'll cry. I love wasabi but man I had to scrape a little bit off. Authentic wasabi for sure but it was still so good. We then went to the **Hakone Open Air Museum**. Was enjoyable and interactive. We spent an hour in there, but we were there just to enjoy, so if you're a fan of sculptures and arts you'd probably take longer than we did. We then did a short drive along the coast to the cape (got dark so didn't stay long) and went back to Senkei hotel to eat our 7/11 haul.   


Hakone -> Narita Airport  
Checking out of Senkei was smooth.  We stopped by **Sukiya in Odawara** to eat breakfast. Made a quick stop by **Odawara Castle Park** to explore a little. Empty and peaceful at 9am. We stopped by another **Don Quijote in Odawara** and got more snacks to bring home. Truly, I enjoyed shopping at other Don Quijote's than the one in Shibuya. It's less crowded and you don't feel pressure to move faster or out of the way out of fear of being shoved. We made a stop at **Yokohama Landmark Tower** to get a pandora charm and go to McDonalds.  Why McDonalds? Well, they had a new seasonal strawberry and sakura paste mochi pie and strawberry churro. Last year was sakura and matcha so I was excited to try a new flavor. We took the coastal route and went through the **Tokyo Wan Aqualine** and it was so cool. Mainly that it was so long and you just knew you were underwater. We made a rest stop at **Umihotaru** and man that stop is amazing. They had different restaurants, shopping area, rest place for pets, awesome view and vending machines to make coffee. And parking was free. We agreed to stop by there again when we come back to Japan just to check it out more without a time constraint. Traffic got really bad on the highway so it's a good thing we estimated to get to the rental car an hour earlier. We made it back to Nissan Rental in time (gas right before though) and took the shuttle to the airport. This was an overall 9 hour transport. 

The parks we stumbled on all had cherry blossoms blooming. Chiba park had full bloom, even though the estimate full bloom is April. 

For Umihotaru you might probably stop by there if you're taking the overnight bus, but I'm not familiar with it so wouldn't know.

Both hotels we stayed off were kind of hidden so be mindful of the sudden turns and narrow streets for two way traffic. Kumonoue was pretty steep incline and narrow two way, and Senkei had narrow two way with pedestrians. 

If you get cold, 7/11 and Family Mart have these heating pads that last different amount of times. They were super helpful for the cold, just peel off the paper and stick it into the inner part of your jacket, don't let it touch your skin cause it will cause burns. They also had some for you feet but they burned with thin socks so wear with thicker socks.",1,1742598457.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

Life’s been a bit quiet lately, and I’m looking to meet someone cool to hang out with—no pressure, no expectations, just good energy.

About Me

I work remotely, I’m into extreme sports (snowboarding, surfing, biking), and I love a weekend day/road trip, live music, comedy clubs, and intellectual conversations over wine, beer, or coffee. 

Anything that involves adventure, good food (especially KBBQ), or just chilling with good company, I’m in. 

Also, I’ve got two dogs that love hikes, so dog people get bonus points.

I recently got out of a long-term relationship, and while I’m not looking for anything romantic or sexual right now, I do want to meet someone to hang out with—go out, check out new places, or just talk about life. 

I’ve been in my own head too much, and a change of pace would be nice. 

If you’re independent, fun, and down to do things like go to a concert, grab drinks, or just have good conversations, hit me up.",1,1742598444.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

不管你怎么想，对我来说，我最重要的目标并不是成为奥林匹克运动员，也不是成为超级模特，而是真正享受我的生活。我过去人生中很长时间都在为了吃苦而吃苦，那种感受真的太糟糕了，我现在只是想好好过我的日子。

Does anyone in the Auckland area (bonus if close to Glen Innes) own an Nvidia shield? Looking for someone that I could come out and test my shield with your power adapter.

I bought an Nvidia Shield Pro off someone on Trademe. They said it was in excellent condition. Bought it home and tested it and it doesn't power on 🙄.
Have tried to contact the seller and organize a refund, but they sold on behalf of someone else and are being painful as hell. I want to test and see if it's the power adapter that's fucked, or if it's the shield itself.

It was pleasant, and now it's 11pm, 4.5 hours after starting the first drink, I don't feel drunk in the slightest and I feel completely awake and stimulated like I've just drunk a coffee.  I feel like all the alcohol has been processed out of my body already but I'm left totally wide awake and know I won't be able to sleep. I'm not the best sleeper but I can usually initially get to sleep OK, the start of the night is usually ok for me (later on it's often not). Tonight it feels like I'm not going to be able to get to sleep for ages now.

Maybe it's because my body has processed the alcohol (I'm a fast processor I think), and I'm getting a rebound stimulatory effect after the CNS depression of the alcohol. I'm also very sensitive to anything neurological.

Does anyone have any ideas as to how I can get over this tonight, any antidote to these aftereffects of alcohol?",2,1742598179.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

I've got a 9mo, and while they'll be breastfed for the next while, I'm looking at soy milk options for when I give them oats or cereal in the mornings, for me to use in coffee, or to use in cooking.

Ideally soy because of its protein and fat make up, and it has to be fortified. I currently use the So Good high protein as the regular So Good has a lot of added sugar and the unsweetened Vitasoy tastes like water. 

Does anyone have any other suggestions?

1jgty3q,https://i.redd.it/23zmnyhah4qe1.jpeg,UK projector for around 400 gbp,"Hi, 

Based in the UK. I have no experience with projectors, but my wife is very keen on getting one for our kitchen/living space. 

Would be for daytime and evening TV viewing, possibly gaming as well.

My initial thought is to protect on to the wall pictured, from a (to be installed) shelf above a sofa on the opposite wall. The distance between the walls is around 5m.

Other possible alternatives are placing the projector on a coffee table just to the right of the sofa, or on a ceiling mount.
Not sure how to decide which option would be best.

I have a loose budget of £400, but could be convinced to stretch it.

Would be willing to mount a screen on the wall, but ideally would be one that rolls away when not in use. Would need advice on a reasonable screen size. 

Thanks in advance ☺️
