1r1wf5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1r1wf5b/how_to_tell_if_someone_likes_you_but_is_too_shy/,How to Tell if Someone Likes You but is Too Shy to Show It: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Ok so here's the thing. I've spent way too much time analyzing this stuff because I used to be painfully oblivious to when people were into me. Like genuinely clueless. Then I went down a rabbit hole reading psychology research, watching Vanessa Van Edwards' videos on body language, and listening to [Matthew Hussey's podcast ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)about dating dynamics. And holy shit, the patterns became so obvious once you know what to look for.



The real mindfuck is that shy people actually give MORE signals than confident ones, they're just way more subtle. It's not about grand gestures or obvious flirting. It's about these tiny micro behaviors that happen unconsciously because their nervous system is literally lighting up around you.



Here's what actually matters when someone's into you but freaking out internally about it.



\*\*The eye contact paradox is insane.\*\* Shy people will look at you constantly when you're not watching, but the second you make eye contact they look away fast. It's not disinterest, it's literally their fight or flight response kicking in. Dr. Monica Moore's research on nonverbal courtship behaviors found this is one of the most reliable attraction indicators. They're studying your face like it's going to be on a test later. You'll catch them staring, they'll get flustered, then within 30 seconds they're sneaking another look. If this keeps happening, yeah, they're into you.



\*\*Their body does this weird magnetic thing.\*\* Even if they're nervous talking to you, their torso and feet point directly at you. It's subconscious. The book ""What Every Body is Saying"" by Joe Navarro, this FBI agent who spent 25 years reading people, explains how our bodies betray our true intentions. Shy people might be looking at their phone or talking to someone else, but their body orientation gives them away. They'll also mirror your movements without realizing. You lean in, they lean in. You cross your arms, they do too a few seconds later. It's their brain trying to build rapport on autopilot.



\*\*They remember weird specific details about you.\*\* Like you mentioned once three weeks ago that you're allergic to shellfish and they remember when picking a restaurant. Or they bring up that random story about your childhood dog. This happens because they're actually listening to everything you say and filing it away. Shy people tend to be more observant because they spend more time watching than talking. When someone's brain is flagging everything about you as important information, that's attraction.



If you want to go deeper into understanding attraction patterns without endless reading, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is a personalized AI learning app that pulls from sources like Matthew Hussey's talks, body language research, and relationship psychology to create audio content tailored to your specific situation. You can set goals like ""understand attraction signals as an introvert"" or ""read people better in dating,"" and it generates a structured learning plan with episodes you can customize from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it connects insights from books, research papers, and expert interviews into one place. The voice options are genuinely addictive too, you can pick anything from a calm, thoughtful tone to something more energetic depending on your mood.



\*\*The nervous energy is so obvious once you notice it.\*\* They fidget more around you. Playing with their hair, adjusting their clothes, touching their face or neck. These are literally self soothing behaviors because you make them anxious in a good way. Their voice might go quieter or they talk faster. Sometimes they'll stumble over words they normally say fine. Robert Glover talks about this in ""[No More Mr Nice Guy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)"", how anxiety and attraction activate similar physiological responses. Your presence is triggering their sympathetic nervous system. That's not nothing.



\*\*They find weird excuses to be near you.\*\* Suddenly they need to use the printer right when you're there. They take the long route that happens to pass your desk. They show up to group hangouts they normally skip if they know you're going. Shy people won't directly ask to spend time with you because rejection feels like death, so they engineer ""coincidental"" proximity. It's actually pretty clever. They're creating opportunities for organic interaction without the risk of explicit rejection.



\*\*Their texting energy is completely different.\*\* This one's huge. Someone who's quiet and awkward in person suddenly writes paragraphs over text. They use more emojis, they're funnier, they actually initiate conversations. That's because the barrier of face to face interaction is gone. They have time to think about responses and don't have to manage their nervous system in real time. If someone's way more engaged digitally than in person, shyness is probably the bridge between those two versions.



Look, human attraction is messy and complicated by a million factors including past trauma, attachment styles, cultural background, all of it. Nobody fits perfectly into these patterns. But if you're seeing like four or more of these signs consistently, the math is mathing. They're probably into you but their brain is screaming at them that expressing it directly is dangerous.



The question is what you do with that information. You can wait for them to make a move, which might never happen because their fear response is too strong. Or you can make it easy for them by being direct yourself. ""Hey I really enjoy talking to you, want to grab coffee this weekend?"" Simple, low pressure, gives them an easy yes or no.



Just don't play games or try to make them jealous to force their hand. That's cruel to someone already struggling with vulnerability. Either you're interested enough to take the initiative or you're not. But at least now you know what you're actually looking at.

Here are our top 10 spots.","Ayubowan Everyone! We just got back from a 14-day trip to Kandy, and I’ll be honest - I was so busy making sure my son didn't lose his passport and actually looked away from his phone that I barely took any photos! 🤦🏽‍♀️

Kandy is so beautiful that I didnt even mind. It felt a bit like home, but with its own special vibe. 

Since we stayed for a full 2 Weeks, we really took our time. 

Here are the Best 10 spots that kept us busy.

1. Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa)

You cannot go to Kandy and miss this. It’s the heart of the city.
​
2. St. Paul’s Cathedral
Right next to the Tooth Temple is this stunning red-brick Anglican church. It’s a peaceful escape from the city noise.

3. Bahirawakanda Vihara Buddha Statue
This is the big white Buddha you see on the hill. The view of the entire Kandy city from the top is breathtaking.

It’s peaceful, and the climb isn't too strenuous. Go at sunset for the best lighting.

4.Indian Summer Restaurant 
If you want a proper sit-down dinner with a view, go here. They have a massive menu with Butter Chicken with Rice and Garkic Naan (my favorite), Pani Puri, Biryani and Gulab Jamun.

5. Balaji Dosai (For the South Indian Soul)
When we missed our Ghee Roast and Filter Coffee, this was our sanctuary. It’s a simple, no-frills vegetarian spot near the temple.

6. Nagalingam's Bhavan
This is a hidden gem for pure vegetarian food. The lady who runs it is so sweet; she treated us like family. Their Thali is filling and very healthy.

7. Saree Kingdom 
8. Junaid Stores
9. Saree Point

Now, I’ll be the first to admit - I’m a jeans, and Tee kind of person. Even for weddings in India, I usually struggle with ethnic wear because I’m always  used to wear Western Dresses. 

However, I have to wear Saree for the First time because of my Sri Lankan friend asked me for the wear for her Homecoming ceremony in Kandy and failed to find Wedding Guest Dresses.

Kandy has more Indian Ethnic Wear boutiques that make Morw Indian fashion feel modern and easy.
Interestingly, the salesmen and ""sales girls"" there seemed to have even more knowledge about Sarees and Draping Styles than some sellers I've met in India.

10. Udawatta Kele 
If your kid likes nature but hates ""manicured gardens,"" take them here. It’s a literal rainforest right behind the Tooth Temple.",1,1770813836.0,SriLankaTravel,0,1.0,False

Person #1, 6ish months ago

Met on Reddit, immediately got along really well. We moved to discord within an hour of chatting. She lived a little further away so first 2 weeks or so we were talking all day over text, and would have video calls every night for 2-3 hours (she'd initiate them) talking about work, life, sharing our days and pictures, watching some shows and just shooting the shit. So far I thought everything was going great. 

We found a weekend where she was going to be in town in the morning, so we decided to meet for lunch. Felt like we'd known each other for ages, I suggested going on a walk after if she was feeling it, she said yes. We walked for a few hours just sharing stories. Was going to drop her off to the station, but she suggested going to an escape room spontaneously and getting dinner / drinks, and that sounded fun so we did it. She kept insisting to pay for dinner despite me already having pulled out my card, so I ended up agreeing because I'd covered everything else.

As I was walking her back after that, she kept telling me she had a great time, and saying stuff like ""we should totally visit X next time"", and ""we need to get revenge on that escape room again"", and generally seeming like we would be seeing each other again. 

Then I never heard from her again. 

===

Person #2, 3 months ago

Met on a dating app. Talked for a day or two, really hit it off. Decided to spontaneously meet over dinner on a 2 hour notice when she suggested it.

Seemed to get along pretty well, conversation was easy, we spent a few hours at the restaurant talking about our travel stories, friends, life plans, philosophy, what have you. We both seemed like we were looking for pretty much the same thing, busy jobs but wanting to have someone to talk / share our free time with. 

We ended up getting kicked out of the restaurant because it was closing, so we moved to a bar. Stayed there till 2am talking about stuff. We only really had one drink each so pretty sober, for context.

Walked her back home after that, and on the way back completely unprompted she asked me what I was doing next weekend, and that she'd be free and in the neighborhood Fri-Sun and I told her that would be great. We made plans to go to a club Friday night. 

She gave me a long hug before I left from below her place. I texted her when I got home, and after a few messages the last thing I heard from her was ""see you on fridayyyy"".

Sent a couple texts but never heard back after that, and she had unmatched with me the day after.

===

Person #3, 2 weeks ago

Again, met on a dating app. Conversation online was meh, she was pretty busy with work so would only hear at nights, but unlike almost all my matches she seemed to be consistently responding and energetic so thought I'd give meeting up a shot. Was not expecting it to lead to much before our date. 

We met for coffee, but the energy in person seemed waaay better, conversation was flowing and we genuinely got along much better than expected. We had very similar backgrounds, interests, etc. Coffee at 3pm eventually turned into dinner at 6pm, which eventually led to her suggesting a bar she really likes. Sat at the bar for a few hours, sharing each other's favorite drinks and stories. She reached out and held my hand partway through and we did the for the last hour or so. 

When it was time to call it, I got her an Uber because of the cold, and she mentioned a couple times about how we should totally meet again. I remember this because I was taken back by her saying it like 3-4 times on her own while waiting for the car, and I really liked the enthusiasm from her end. 

We texted for a while after she got back that night, and some direct quotes from her were:

""I had an amazing time!!""
""I'm still listening to (the song I recommended) hehe""
""I was just dancing. (...) I dance by myself sometimes when I'm happy 😊. Mostly because of you""
""Goodnight 🥰""

Went to text her next morning, but found she had unmatched me on Hinge, and also blocked me on snap/insta. ???

===

So clearly these are missing their side of the story, but I've just been... really confused by these interactions. Maybe I did something to put them off, but why would you pretend like you want to meet again?

I'm generally very aware of not putting people in an uncomfortable spot, and actively avoid asking while on a first date if they want to see me again, just because no one likes saying ""no I'd rather not"" to your face. I did reciprocate the enthusiasm when others bring it up if we got along. 

To be honest this has been kind of putting me off dating. I feel like increasingly the more I see people it's hard to really enjoy myself because I can't really even tell if they're apparently just faking everything.

It's one thing to not get along, or for them to just say they're not interested. But to just be left hanging after showing what seemed like genuine interest just really fucking sucks",1,1770813731.0,datingadviceformen,1,1.0,False

1r1wa52,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r1wa52,I built an autonomous bug bounty framework (open source) – looking for real feedback and Contributors.,"Hi all,

I’ve been working in offensive security and bug bounty for years, and recently I built something I originally created just for myself:

An autonomous, poly-agent bug bounty framework called **BugTraceAI**

What it actually does

Instead of just running tools and summarizing output, it tries to replicate a structured bug bounty workflow:

* Recon & surface mapping
* Endpoint discovery
* Parameter analysis
* Hypothesis generation
* Targeted testing (XSS, IDOR, auth issues, misconfigs, etc.)
* Iterative retesting based on findings
* Structured reporting

It runs in cycles — similar to how a human hunter pivots once something interesting appears.

# What it’s NOT

* Not magic.
* Not “AI finds 0days everywhere”.
* Not a replacement for experienced hunters.

It’s more like a tireless junior that follows methodology very strictly and doesn’t get bored.

# Why I built it

I wanted to experiment with:

* Whether methodology can be modeled
* Whether vulnerability chaining can emerge autonomously
* How far we can push low-cost LLM-driven testing loops

Surprisingly, running full attack cycles can cost less than a cup of coffee depending on scope.

# Why I’m posting here

I’m not selling anything. It’s fully open source.

I’d honestly appreciate feedback from real bug bounty hunters:

* Where do you think automation helps?
* Where do you think it will always fail?
* What would you never trust an autonomous system to do?

If anyone wants to test it in labs or controlled bounty scopes and share brutal feedback, I’m all ears also looking for.

The events, dialogues, and scenarios depicted are entirely a work of fiction and the product of the author's imagination. This is intended for entertainment purposes only and does not claim to represent real-life events or the actual thoughts of the individuals mentioned.\]**

**\[Intro / Summary\]** We all know the ""Clean Guy"" image Sidharth Malhotra works hard to maintain. He’s hyper-aware of cameras, mostly because he’s terrified of another ""foot-in-mouth"" experience. Contrast that with Barun Sobti, who is clean—effortlessly detached and naturally unbothered.

What happens when Sid tries to ""borrow"" Barun’s brooding energy to handle an interview with Parineeti Chopra, but she decides to hit him with the one thing he’s been avoiding for a decade?

This is a meta-look at their friendship, the weight of old guilt, and the day the cameras refused to stop rolling.

**\[Author’s Foreword\]** ""In an industry of PR-gloss, some wounds are real. This story explores the chaotic bond between Sid and Pari, referencing their actual 2014 friction. It features a very confused Sidharth, a brilliant Parineeti, and the enigmatic Barun Sobti as the reluctant mentor for a guy who is just too 'nice' for his own good. Expect real Hinglish and a look at what happens when the 'Golden Retriever' tries to become a 'Wolf'."" — **Serial Fics**

**Setting:** A brightly lit, chic studio in Mumbai. The year is 2026. **Sidharth Malhotra** is looking sharp in a linen blazer, sitting across from his long-time friend and *Hasee Toh Phasee* co-star, **Parineeti Chopra**, who is guest-hosting the segment.

**EXT. STUDIO - DAY**

The ""ON AIR"" sign glows red. The camera pans from a poster of Sidharth’s new film to Parineeti, who is grinning widely. Sidharth looks relaxed, leaning back with a coffee mug.

**PARINEETI** (To camera) So, guys, today we have a very special guest. Isse aapne bohot roles mein dekha hai—soldier, spy, lover boy—par aaj, mere sawalon se bachne ke liye koi script nahi hai iske paas. Welcome, Sid!

**SIDHARTH** (Laughing) Thanks, Pari. Honestly, jab mujhe pata chala ki tum interview le rahi ho, I was 50% excited and 50% scared. Mujhe pata hai tumhare dimaag mein kya khuraafat chalti hai.

**PARINEETI** (Winking at the camera crew) Arre, trust me na! Hum toh purane dost hain. *Hasee Toh Phasee* se leke ab tak, nothing has changed.

They chat for a few minutes about the film. Sidharth is in his element, talking about the ""hard work"" and ""vision."" Parineeti keeps nodding, but her expression slowly starts to shift into something more serious, even slightly strained.

**PARINEETI:** (Smiling, but her eyes are sharp) Waise Sid, we’ve done two films together. Sabko lagta hai it’s all fun and games. But you know, sometimes words stay with you longer than movies do.

**SIDHARTH:** Deep, Pari. Very deep. Kya hua? Are you still mad I stole your protein bars on the *Jabariya Jodi* set?

**PARINEETI:** (She doesn't laugh. Her tone shifts to something raw.) Nahi. I was thinking about the *Ek Villain* promotions. Remember that interview? You joked about taking 'weight gain lessons' from me because you needed to bulk up... I was fighting depression and struggling so much back then, Sid. Everyone knew it. I thought my friend would have my back, not use my struggle as a punchline.

**SIDHARTH:** (The act shatters instantly. He looks at the camera, then back at her, eyes wide with 'innocent' panic.) Pari... that was a decade ago. I was just being stupid. I didn't mean it like that.

**PARINEETI:** (Her voice cracks. She looks at her cue cards, her hand visibly trembling.) I know. But you never said it to me. (She clears her throat, trying to stay professional) Anyway, next question... Fans want to know if—

She stops. Her eyes swim. She takes a shaky breath, pressing her lips together to stop the quiver.

**SIDHARTH** (Eyes widening, completely panicked) Hey... hey, Pari? Are you serious? Mike check? Guys, cut the cameras?

The crew stays silent, but the ""Live"" light stays on.

**SIDHARTH:** (Leaning in, his voice dropping to a frantic, breathy *sotto voce*. He’s whispering so the mics don't catch it, but his eyes are darting toward the crew.) Pari... listen. Yeh kya kar rahi hai? Not here, yaar. I know I messed up back then—I was an idiot, I was immature—but why bring this up *now*? (A beat of silence as he sees her shoulders shake) Pari, look at me. I’ve felt like a loser about that comment for years, trust me. Remember that party? I didn't even think twice before helping you with that wardrobe thing... I thought you knew that was my way of saying sorry. Please, don't do this live...

**PARINEETI:** (Cutting him off, voice thick) Protecting my clothes isn't the same as protecting my dignity, Sid. (Whispering) I can’t do this... Give me a minute.

She turns away, burying her face in her hands. Her shoulders heave in silent, rhythmic sobs.

**SIDHARTH:** (Pale-faced. He gestures wildly to the crew.) Guys... cut the cams. Cut them! Band karo yaar, she’s actually upset! Is this still live?!

The crew doesn't move. The ""LIVE"" light stays red. One camera zooms in on Sidharth’s horrified face as he realizes his ""Clean Guy"" image is evaporating in 4K.

So I've been working on something for a while now and I think this community would be interested in it. The app is called Walk With Me. The idea is simple, it lets you find people nearby to walk with. You can schedule walks in advance or join ones happening right now in your area.

The reason I built it is simple, a good buddy of mine I usually go out for walks with bailed on me one night, no hard feelings, and I still went out for a walk, but as I am walking, I noticed other people doing the same thing and I thought, ""It would be nice if we could all join up and go for a walk together!"" and the idea for the app came out.

It's a social fitness app at its core. You match with people based on location, pace, and schedule. There are safety features built in, verified profiles, filters based on preferences, live location sharing with people you trust...etc.

We're currently looking for 50 beta testers to help us figure out what works and what doesn't. If you're someone who walks regularly or wants to start, I'd genuinely love to have you involved!

I’d like to introduce an app I developed myself called **""PartCycle""**, built specifically to solve this headache!

🔥 **Why do you need it? (How is it different from a Calendar?)** Regular calendars are ""static."" Say you set a reminder to change your filter every 3 months. If you change it early, or get busy and forget, the next calendar reminder is wrong, and you have to manually fix it. It's a hassle!

✅ **PartCycle is DYNAMIC!** It automatically calculates the next due date based on the day you *actually* replace the item. Whether you change it early or late, the schedule always adjusts to you.

✨ **Core Features:**

* **Dynamic Tracking:** Just hit the ""Replace"" button, and the next date is set automatically.
* **Smart Reminders:** Get notified automatically before things expire (e.g., 3 days prior).
* **100% Free & No Ads:** I insist on no ads for the best user experience! The free version tracks up to 10 items—perfect for most households.

1r1w3uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThisIsntRight/comments/1r1w3uf/i_thought_i_lived_alone/,I Thought I Lived Alone,"For three months, my roommate paid rent and never came home.

It seemed like the best house-share I'd ever had.

Finding someone in this city is always a risk. Desperate ads and ten minute meetings with strangers, trying to decide if you can trust them in your home. After my last arrangement ended with my roommate trying to install a home podcast studio in the middle of the living room at 3am, all I wanted was something uncomplicated.

Someone who pays their rent on time and basically stays out of my way.

Leo seemed perfect for that.

He was a geological consultant and worked overseas constantly. According to the ad, he was sometimes gone for months at a time. He just needed a home address, somewhere to store some belongings and a place to crash a few times a year for maybe a week or so every few months. What he was willing to pay in rent seemed like a lot, considering he'd barely be here, but he explained that ease was more important than price for him and he liked my apartment's location.

We met once in a coffee shop. He was normal. Polite. Clean-cut. Firm handshake. By the time we finished our coffee he had transferred three months' rent plus the security deposit. He was off to South America the next morning and said he wouldn't be back for 3 months. He moved his stuff in that afternoon, when I was out, so I never saw him.

It seemed like the perfect scenario, a roommate who existed mostly on paper.

For two months, it was.

The apartment was silent and calm. It felt like I had the place to myself, only cheaper.

Then, little things started happening.

The first time was subtle enough I almost convinced myself I’d imagined it. A framed photo of my sister and I, which I usually kept on a table near the front door, was on the living room bookshelf. I stood there for a long minute trying to remember putting it there. I couldn’t recall ever touching it. I was busy, tired, stressed with work, and so it seemed like the obvious explanation that I’d done it subconsciously and forgotten. I put it back and tried not to think about it.

A week later, my favorite coffee mug went missing.

It wasn't in the cupboards, the sink, or the dishwasher. After about ten minutes I found it in the bathroom sink. I tried to remember bringing coffee into the bathroom, drinking it while I brushed my teeth, but no memory came.

I again told myself I was being too stressed, too forgetful.

But the apartment began to feel different after that.

The quiet that had previously been calming was now watchful.

The building creaked and settled at night the same way it always had, but each sound seemed more intentional.

Then the food started to disappear.

Not in large quantities, nothing obvious. A single apple from the bowl, a missing slice of cheese from a new package. The kind of thing you doubt yourself over.

I started paying more attention to the fridge contents. The next day, the pull-tab on a can of soda was on the counter.

I hadn't opened it.

It was at that point the true dread began to sink in. Leo's door at the end of the hall remained shut. He had now been gone for almost three months, we’d only corresponded via email twice, once for the rent confirmation and once because I asked him how the project was going.

""Indefinite. Project extended. Hope all is well.""

One evening when I came home, I noticed a smell. Faint, but definitely there. Earthy, metallic, slightly damp. It was wrong. The smell seemed to come from Leo’s room. I sniffed closer to his door; was something forgotten inside? Spilled when he left? But it didn't smell like any specific thing I could think of.

That night I woke up to a soft scraping sound from the hall. I sat bolt upright, straining to hear. I watched the crack of light under my door, expecting a shadow to pass. No shadow came. I eventually decided it was just the old building shifting.

The next morning, I found the footprint.

It was on the kitchen tile, just a few feet from Leo’s door. A muddy imprint from the front of a boot, with dark soil clinging to it. My blood went cold. The smell, the food, the mug, the footprint. Someone had been inside my apartment.

I considered calling the police, but what would I say? A moved mug, some dirt on the floor? I knew what the response would be. For the next week I jumped at every sound. I put a chair against my bedroom door at night. I couldn’t tell which thought was more frightening, that I wasn’t alone in the apartment, or that I was actually losing my mind.

But then last Tuesday night, I came home and noticed Leo's door was ajar.

It hadn't been opened in months.

I just stood at the entrance, paralyzed.

""Leo?""

No answer.

""Leo? Are you home?""

Nothing.

My hands were trembling as I made my way down the hallway. I pushed the door open further and felt for the light switch.

The room was completely empty.

There was no bed, no dresser, no boxes or possessions. Nothing. It was as if no one had ever lived in the room at all.

The only thing I could see in the room was a Polaroid photograph taped at eye level on the opposite wall.

I walked across and peeled it from the wall.

It was me, sleeping, in my own bed. Taken from the foot of the mattress. My face looked ghostly and blank from the flash. The chair was visible, jammed against the handle of my bedroom door, in the background of the photograph.

It was dated on the back from the night before.

My stomach clenched and I stumbled backward, my heel catching on something on the floor behind the door.

A canvas duffel bag.

Inside, tangled and muddy, with thorns clinging to them, were my clothes. And photos. Dozens of them. Of me cooking. Sitting on the couch. Watching TV. Standing by the sink.

In the side pocket of the duffel bag, a small plastic bag contained chunks of my hair and nail clippings.

I ran.

I left my apartment without any of my belongings, calling the police from the nearest gas station two miles away.

When the police searched the apartment they found nothing; Leo's room was empty and clean of all evidence. There was no duffel bag, no photographs and no scent of him lingering in the room. The landlord stated that Leo had paid his rent and didn't seem to know anything about him. Leo's cell number was disconnected, the only record of his presence being a driver's license linked to a P.O. Box.

I moved cities two days ago, I can’t say where I am. I have three locks on my front door. And each night I wake up with the distinct feeling that someone is standing at my doorway.

Watching.

I thought I had found the perfect roommate, someone who was never there.

The truth is, he was always there.",1,1770813029.0,ThisIsntRight,0,1.0,False

I currently make about $50k as a coffee shop supervisor. I want to make at least $70k eventually so I can live alone, have pets (a dog and a cat), be comfortable, and save for retirement. I'm not a huge spender.

What I love about my current job:

\- People interactions and getting to delight people

\- Being the person people come to for guidance

\- One of my favorite moments was when a coworker decided to sign up for college because I shared my experience and encouraged her - I love helping people on their journeys and seeing them take steps forward

\- Being on my feet all day

\- Helping people with practical problems

What I don't like:

\- Being the bad guy and enforcing heartless policies (like kicking homeless people out in winter)

\- Cleaning

What I want in my life:

\- At least $70k salary

\- Time off for friends, socializing, watching TV

\- Leave my job at my job so home can be home

\- Regular sleep schedule

\- I want coworkers to socialize with, not just clients

My concerns about grad school:

\- Lots of time and money to get where I need to be - is it worth it?

\- What if I'm bad at it and actually hate it?

\- I could end up somewhere with no coworkers and just clients, and I want more socializing than that

\- I don't think it's really an up and moving around career, more sitting (but I like being on my feet)

\- It can be very draining

What appeals to me:

\- I think I would get to create a career that fits me

\- Working with people and helping them on their journeys

\- I think there are places I could work alongside other counselors even if we have our own clients

\- I think I could use my license to do other stuff, maybe at a college as an advisor or something

\- I'm more interested in working with college students than kids

My questions:

\- Is the debt and time investment worth it to get to $70k+?

\- Can you actually leave work at work or does it follow you home emotionally?

\- How much sitting vs moving around is the job really?

\- Do you have coworkers you interact with regularly or is it isolating?

\- How did you know grad school was worth it before you started?

\- For those in school counseling or college student affairs - does the job give you good work-life balance?",1,1770813014.0,psychologystudents,0,1.0,False

[MI],"I'm graduating with a psychology degree and business minor this spring and trying to decide on my career path. I currently make about $50k as a coffee shop supervisor and want to get to $70k+ so I can live alone, have pets, and save for retirement.

I'm considering HR because I love working with people and helping them, but I have some concerns and want to know if this career would actually fit what I want in life.

  What I love about my current job:

\- People interactions and getting to delight people

\- Being the person people come to for guidance on what to do

\- One of my favorite moments was when a coworker decided to sign up for college because I shared my experience and encouraged her - I love helping people take steps forward in their lives

\- Being on my feet all day

  What I don't like:

\- Being the bad guy and enforcing policies that feel heartless (like kicking homeless people out in winter because they didn't buy anything)

\- Cleaning

  What I want in my life:

\- Make at least $70k so I can live alone, have a dog and a cat, and save for retirement

\- Time off for friends, socializing, and watching TV

\- Leave my job at my job so home can be home

\- I'm not a huge spender, just want to be comfortable

  My questions about HR:

\- How much of your day is actually computer-based vs interacting with people?

\- How often do you have to be the ""bad guy"" - firing people, enforcing policies that feel wrong?

\- Can you actually leave work at work or does it follow you home?

\- Does the job give you those moments of really helping someone and seeing them grow, or is it more about helping the organization?

\- What does work-life balance actually look like?

I also like helping people with practical problems. Would HR be a good fit given what I've described, or should I be looking at something else?",1,1770812832.0,AskHR,4,1.0,False

1r1vxvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Key-Badger5677/comments/1r1vxvh/solo_travelling_experience_in_luxury_nature/,Solo Travelling Experience in Luxury Nature Resorts,"I didn’t choose solo travel because I wanted to “find myself.” I chose it because I was tired. Tired of noise, rushed plans and trips that felt more like checklists than experiences. Booking a solo stay at a luxury nature resort felt like a small experiment. It turned into something much bigger.

https://preview.redd.it/d9ozx5buyuig1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce1a8c0eda06df16acb5bc7b1a4c192081925d75

My first solo stay was at RiverMist, a quiet luxury resort surrounded by forest and a slow-moving river. The drive itself slowed me down. Patchy network. Narrow roads. Fewer signs. When I arrived, no one rushed me. That mattered more than I expected. Within an hour my shoulders dropped. You know that feeling when your body finally believes it’s allowed to rest? That was it.

The morning became my favorite part. In morning I woke up before sunrise then stepped outside with coffee. Mist floated over the thickly on river and silver and the only sound was water brushing against the rocks below. I stood there longer than planned. No phone. No music. Just watching light change. That quiet stayed with me all day.

Food hits differently when you travel solo in nature. During a guided forest walk at RiverMist, the guide showed us wild herbs locals still cook with. Later that night, one of those herbs appeared in my dinner. I remembered its smell from the trail. The taste felt familiar, not fancy. That connection made the meal memorable not the plating.

I used to think eating alone would feel awkward. It didn’t. One evening, rain started halfway through dinner. Instead of moving indoors the staff lit candles and let the rain fall around us. I ate slowly, watched ripples spread across the river and noticed I hadn’t checked my phone in over an hour. That rarely happens in my normal life.

Luxury nature resorts work well for solo travellers because they remove decisions. One day I kayaked alone, drifting quietly while birds skimmed the water. Another afternoon I read in a hammock for three straight hours. No guilt. No agenda. When you travel solo, you start choosing based on how you feel not what you “should” do.

There was a small moment on my last day that stayed with me. While checking out, the staff asked if I enjoyed travelling alone. I answered honestly. I never felt lonely. Between the river, the slow mornings and the thoughtful care the space felt full.

If you’re thinking about solo travel, start with a luxury nature resort like RiverMist. Go somewhere that values calm as much as comfort. You come back rested, yes. But more than that you return knowing your own company is not something to escape. It something worth keeping.

Not for a photoshoot, not for a perfectly curated Instagram grid, but purely for the joy of playing with color and texture. My latest adventure involved attempting to infuse a touch of *chaotic curator* into my everyday routine without looking like I'd actively fought a glitter explosion. The challenge? Making a multi-layered, intentionally ""undone"" eye look feel cohesive enough for a coffee run.

Here's how that Saturday morning experiment unfolded:

*   **The Aesthetic Goal:** My mind was on ""art gallery owner who just rolled out of bed but still looks impeccably interesting."" Think mismatched textures, a hint of unexpected color, and a general air of creative nonchalance. Definitely leaning into the *chaotic curator* vibe, but with a *functionalist* undercurrent – it had to last and not feel like a costume.

*   **Key Products & My Unconventional Choices:**
    *   **Base:** I started with the **NYX Professional Makeup Jumbo Eye Pencil** in 'Black Bean' ($6 at most drugstores). Instead of a precise liner, I scribbled it messily over my lid, focusing on the outer corner and lash line. The goal was an uneven, smudgy canvas.
    *   **Unexpected Pop:** Next, I grabbed the **ColourPop Super Shock Shadow** in 'Roy G Biv' ($7 on their site), a vibrant matte teal. I pressed this *lightly* with my finger right in the center of the smudged black base, just a whisper of color peeking through. My usual go-to would be a deep plum, so this was a fun departure.
    *   **Texture Play:** For that ""just threw it on"" shimmer, I used a tiny bit of the **Kaja Beauty Bento Bouncy Eyeshadow Trio** in 'Chocolate Dahlia' ($26 from Sephora) – specifically the middle shimmery shade. I just tapped it with my pinky finger onto the inner corner and the very center of my lid, avoiding any sharp lines.
    *   **Defining the Chaos:** A quick flick of **KISS Falscara Lengthening Mascara** in 'Black' ($8, Amazon) to separate lashes. No false lashes, no super-defined liner – just enough to frame the eyes.

*   **Application Technique & Time Invested:** This whole eye look took me about **12 minutes**. It was all about using my fingers or just quickly smudging with a dense brush. The technique was less about precision and more about layering and allowing imperfections to become part of the charm. The key was *not* over-blending, which would have erased the intentional chaos.

**Real Talk: What Went Down & What I Learned**

My first attempt definitely leaned more ""chaotic"" than ""curator."" I put too much black pencil down, and the teal got completely swallowed. It looked like I'd been up all night, not in an effortlessly cool way, but in a ""did you forget to wash your face?"" way.

The lesson? For a truly *chaotic curator* look to work, there needs to be a subtle underlying structure. I realized I needed to apply the black base *more sheerly* than I usually would for a smokey eye, allowing the skin to show through in places. Also, the teal needed to be a *light pat*, not a full application, to maintain that unexpected peeking effect. It's not about making it perfect, but about finding a sweet spot where the ""mess"" looks intentional, not accidental. It also proved that sometimes, layering unexpected textures and colors from different price points can create a really unique effect that a single, expensive palette might not achieve.

# 🧪 Sam’s Experience With Vidnoz AI

Sam, my marketing assistant, runs a side hustle creating short videos for small local businesses—mostly gyms, salons, and a vegan café that insists on pastel everything.

He’s always juggling a few dozen tasks, so finding tools that save time without sacrificing quality is kind of his thing.

When I asked him to [trial Vidnoz](http://ecowebdesign.co.uk/vidnoz-ai-official) for a client pitch, he was cautiously optimistic.

He wrote a short promo script for a pilates studio, picked a confident but friendly female avatar, and selected one of the **AI voices with emotional tone support** that had a slight British lilt.

Ten minutes later, he had a fully rendered, branded clip in 1080p that was polished enough to send directly to the client—no tweaks needed.

He was especially impressed with the **AI presenter video tool**, since it allowed him to turn a plain text doc into something visually engaging, without filming anything himself.

The client loved it. Sam, on the other hand, noticed one drawback: he couldn’t control the breathing pauses between lines, which made one segment feel a little too rushed.

But he shrugged it off, saying, “Honestly, it still looks better than half the influencer ads I see on TikTok.”

For someone who’s always short on time and high on expectations, Vidnoz was a win.

1r1vssg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HETERDOX/comments/1r1vssg/the_good_book/,THE GOOD BOOK,"Approach to the Bible is missing from modern Australian men. Why? There are a number of reasons, there are some star candidates, the internet and the mobile phone are two that come to mind, the subsequent barrage of knowledge that is the Internet, one may think that all the knowledge of life is on the internet, all one could ever need is definitely on your smart phone, so why do I concern myself with such a trivial matter, when every passage, chapter and verse of the bible has been documented on the internet in a myriad of styles and media. 

I concern myself with this because it is simply not true that all wisdom can be found on the internet. A great deal of temptation can be found, and my word wisdom and money and all the wheels of modern life can be found on the internet. Why do I concern myself for the bible. To answer that I would ask you to find yourself a bible, own it, have it in a place where it is seen every day. Make the writings of the bible become to take up two minutes of your day. Each day. Psalms and Proverbs are a good place to start, I turn to one of these two chapters and I read. For those among us that have lived with a bible, understood the teachings and appreciated its presence in your life. I know that all of you have experienced this one standard that separates the bible, from any other work of literature. The bible is Alive, and you know this because you have felt it. The bible will guide your  soul, it will give you wisdom in matters heart, and it will give you this guidance even when you do not look for it. The bible will find you. 

Many times I have had a heavy day or there is something that has been really vexing me, I will want to take me mind off  what ever it is, so I pick up my bible, hard copy, not the phone, and while reading it will dawn on me that what I am reading, is providing me with the clues to be able to navigate the situation. The answer will arrive. I did not look for it, It found me… 

The reason I say hard copy is because the hard copy is not attached to Porn Hub, or your social media accounts, it is not your computer, so you need to hold it, and put everything else in your life on hold. What a privilege, and this gift of Wisdom is now freely available to any that seek it. Why do people not read the bible, or wish to seek the knowledge within? 

They who are responsible for distributing the word of the bible, they have not kept with the times. Certainly they have a web page, Instagram and Facebook, though what have they done to get people interested in the lessons learnt. I blame the church, they are not all as bad as what I am about to speak of, some in Australia have bands and do some great work with youth, though for the modern adult that has seen life before the internet, one who does not believe in God as a physical construct, though feels that there is a force that can not be explained by science. Well that just makes you normal. I do not have the answers as to if God is real, for there is no question. Most certainly there is not a Omni Present being whom is consciously aware of all things and at all times, I don’t fall on that sword. Though I will believe in the men who where inspired to express this knowledge, no matter how this inspiration was delivered, the results are what we have before us today. The new and old Testament. 

For they who are lucky enough to read and speak Arabic and english, you have the added bonus of the Quran. I have two copies of the English translation of the Quran. It is a fine read. I have many passages that are of note, and approaches to subject that I find to be refreshing. This is the strength of the House of Scripture, for this will be a christian organisation, though it will have nothing to do with matters of the old church. Wisdom is for every man, and they who learn from the teachings from the God of Abraham, they have all prospered. They have not only found wisdom and knowledge, the inspiration found they creating wheels, large structures, farms, musical instruments fashioned from wood, and most importantly, they created a manner to communicate and teach others. Eventually Gutenberg was born and the press was invented, and this today is this in my eyes the one invention that has improved the quality of human existence for many many years.

The House of Scripture will discuss these matters and compare as equals, not to be woke, no, to forgo all the history that is between the peoples whom are not from this land. Here we have the privilege of being free from many of the horrors that are the day to day lives of they who live without that privilege. This is not the case here, and I will lean on that because this is a christian organisation that wants to learn from our brothers in arms. First things first and that is creating the structure so to be able to make the idea a feasible action. The entire purpose is to remove the weird from church, or Synagogue or Mosque, come together, once a week, yes there will be a sermon, though it will not talk about God and you not having control. 

This will be about community coming together, we know so much about one another Matrix character, though face to face, without a phone to escape into any time you feel mildly bored or uncomfortable. This place will not talk of other religion as felt by they in the past that ones denomination governed how they lived. No. This is a simple initiative to get the Bible in the hand of Adults, and for the subject of God to be on the forefront of our discussions. The education of our children is being suffocated by the many that affiliate the inadequacies of the church, the outdated approach of the Church, they place the Bible in the same basket as the institution. The bible is no longer up to date and relevant to the lives of children today. 

I would have to disagree, I feel it is needed more in our schools and homes today, more that any other time in a very long time. I really need to stress the importance of the community and having fun while the service is open. Music that is not Hymns, performance or a speaker. Though on the regular, I think that an element of music needs to be part of the service. Music can help move the inhibitions not to open themself, music can be the key to this spirit. Finally there will need be food. This is also a section of the service that is important, the rules of the old guard need be removed. This return to what is real, what is simple, the understanding that the life lived by us all is surrounded by manipulative =noise. This is where the strength of the bible comes into its own. You find yourself a place to read, you have yourself a cup of tea, coffee. Wine or water, and for that period, you have no phone, no television, no titties, twinks or lady boys. It is just you and the eternal wisdom of man kind. That is my privileged, and I will take advantage of this, for all they whom have become woke, I ask you to follow this example, the bible has lots in there for everyone. 

Being a citizen of this country, breathing the fresh air, having drinking water in my kitchen on tap, all these are incredible achievements my man kind. And it is these small achievements in engineering.

Let's admit it: Our brains weren't designed to remember these dates! 🧠❌

I’d like to introduce an app I developed myself called **""PartCycle""**, built specifically to solve this headache!

🔥 **Why do you need it? (How is it different from a Calendar?)** Regular calendars are ""static."" Say you set a reminder to change your filter every 3 months. If you change it early, or get busy and forget, the next calendar reminder is wrong, and you have to manually fix it. It's a hassle!

✅ **PartCycle is DYNAMIC!** It automatically calculates the next due date based on the day you *actually* replace the item. Whether you change it early or late, the schedule always adjusts to you.

✨ **Core Features:**

* **Dynamic Tracking:** Just hit the ""Replace"" button, and the next date is set automatically.
* **Smart Reminders:** Get notified automatically before things expire (e.g., 3 days prior).
* **100% Free & No Ads:** I insist on no ads for the best user experience! The free version tracks up to 10 items—perfect for most households.

You only need to upgrade if you are a gear-head, want cloud backup, or need to track more items (and want to buy the developer a coffee ☕).

1r1vmj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r1vmj0/i_wasnt_single_when_we_met_but_now_that_im_single/,"I wasn't single when we met. But now that I'm single again, I'm interested in him. But now he values/appreciates our friendship too much.","I (35F) met a friend (40M) when I was in a relationship; I coincidentally met him and his child as we were doing a hobby we all enjoy.

He gave subtle hints that he is single, such as bringing up his child's mom and her mom's preferences for coffee. Which was odd to me because why would I care about the coffee preferences of two people I'll never meet. It took about five seconds for me to realize that both times, he emphasized *'my ex'* & *'my ex-MIL'* while attempting to look at me, I'm assuming to see if I give any reaction. Eventually, our conversation led to past travels, and that allowed me to bring up places where my *boyfriend* and I have traveled together. He immediately gave that reaction of smiling while clearly thinking, 'Well, I have no chance with her.'

Skip ahead 3 months, we'd frequently see each other at the same places where we enjoy doing our shared hobby. In that time frame, I'd become great friends with this friend and his child. However, there were times where the child would act out of character, and they clearly made a poor impact on my friend because the child's actions weren't their true thoughts/feelings. He would give me minor details about the kid's mom such as poor influences that she had as she grew up that had affected their relationship in the long-run along with things that she'd do to poorly inconvenience him.

Meanwhile the whole time that I have known this dad-friend, he has always gone above and beyond for his child. Teaching him multiple necessary skills for life whether in or out of the house (including cooking), simply teaching the kid how to be a kind person/what to do & not to do, spoiling the kid with love such as treating them to gifts & taking them out to different cities during weekends or flying for vacation. He really does so much solely for the sake of giving his child a good life. I cannot express how much I admire him for being the dad he is.

Eventually, the mom found my social media because of tags and started stalking my stories. Which is understandable because I'd also want to make sure any child of mine is not hanging around bad people. So I let her stalk my stories because she wasn't causing issues.

One day, his child waited until their dad wasn't nearby to insult me. Which was completely out of character; especially since the outfit and make up was the exact one that they complimented 2 months prior. I had used it a couple times in the 3 months, and not once have they said anything rude to me beforehand. I ignored that and changed the subject to focus on our shared hobby of interest. But I waited until I got home to message the dad-friend what his child said to me; which he knows is also out of character because he's attempting to raise his child to be kind to everyone. He went into more detail of what his child has been saying & doing, which is clearly *'monkey see, monkey do'* or *'copy cat.'* Which had been affecting him because he wants to raise his kid to be a good person, and the actions of his ex contradict what he wants to teach/raise his child.

Eventually, this situation made it easier for him to open up to me in the long-run; he now vents to me about issues that he deals with. And honestly, I vent to him too when I need to. But that day, I blocked his ex because it was clear that she hated me solely because she hates anyone associated with her ex, aka my friend. To this day, she has *never* met me nor has she asked to meet me.

It's been more than half a year since then, and this kid has never insulted me again or acted out of character. Throughout the time since then, I've basically become the dad's best friend, and even do my best to assist him/back him up when he attempts to teach the kid what to do/not to do, doing my best to be a positive influence at all times, honestly I've been attempting to be good friend in general to both this man and his child. This kid is only in their single digits, so I'm definitely trying to put effort in making this kid have a good time doing the hobbies that the 3 of us enjoy. Handling children with care and kindness is definitely an easy task for me because of my personal childhood having been around multiple children whether it was my family or extended family.

Skip ahead to when I'm single, the dad-friend obviously was one of the first to know because I needed someone to vent to. In recent months, he has been giving subtle hints again and saying jokes that are NSFW on a minor level that his child wouldn't understand; which I personally don't mind. He even offered to spend the weekend in a different city 3 hours away, which I accepted the offer and went with them. And after a few weeks of that going on, he told me for the very first time that I look pretty. The outfit I wore that day wasn't new and he'd seen it almost a dozen times; but it was the first time he saw me in that outfit since I became single.

A couple weeks later, we spent the day doing the hobby the three of us enjoy, and all I had planned for the night was to watch my favourite team play their game. They talked about offering to spend the night with me in the future and watch a movie or game then play some card games or other games they had at home. I told them, ""I've got nothing planned, so I'd be down to do that tonight. I can order pizza, too."" We asked the kid if that was okay, and that's exactly what we did that night.

After my friend's child fell asleep, we had drinks and watched a movie. At some point, I couldn't hide it; I grabbed my friend's hand and told him that I deeply admire him for who he is. We hooked up for a couple hours, and eventually went out for a cigarette. He talked about how with his current situation of transferring jobs, he's not ready for a relationship, but he does value me and our friendship a whole lot. But I knew what I was getting into when I told him my feelings because he tells me everything, including back when he was looking for a second job along with his long-term plan regarding that. I totally told him that I respect that decision and I wouldn't mind whatever type of relationship he wants with me. I told him I'm good with platonic or FWB and it was completely his choice because I have no issues with him at all and I won't interfere with anything he does. We ended up with a third round after going back inside; and I fell asleep on the couch because we agreed not to show anything in front of his kid.

The next time we hung out, I was on my monthly and he and his child had plans for that night with another person we all know that shared our hobby. We texted the day after, and he told me that he really does think I'm attractive, he loves hanging out with me, and doesn't want to ruin our relationship/friendship in case something happens while he's got two jobs. I had to remind him that I totally respect his decision, but we're both mature enough to continue our friendship whether it's platonic or FWB. Then I mentioned my IUD is still good for a couple more years. He agreed that a FWB could work for now.

Since then, we have had no issues with anything. But honestly, I do wish for a relationship with this man. I've spent a lot of time getting to know him and his child, and I really do admire and respect him a lot for who he is. I wish to give him the love he deserves for being the kind man he has proven to be. Anyway, his child definitely thinks of me as a good friend and understands that I'm willing to make him happy too with the little things when we're hanging out. But its highly obvious right now that a romantic relationship isn't good for him for now. The timing of my previous relationship ending and me witnessing first-hand the respectable man that he is definitely wasn't lined up. Maybe by the end of the year, we will be in a long-term relationship? I really do admire him so much for who he is, but I'm totally good with a FWB for the time being. He did say, *'for now'* which makes me think that a romantic long-term relationship could happen.

TL;DR

I became friends with a father and his child. He was clearly interested in me, but I was in a relationship at the time, which he respected and accepted being friends. But his ex causing trouble for me caused us to become best friends who vent to each other, and as time passed, I began admiring the dad that he is to his child; he *deserves* the ""BEST DAD IN THE WORLD"" mug. But now that I'm single and have helped him technically 'co-parent' his child, he values me too much to risk ruining his friendship with me now that he is in the middle of attempting to replace his job with a better job. We hooked up when we had the chance, but agreed to try a FWB friendship because we both find each other attractive and get along. But in the future when he is settled, I definitely want to attempt a long-term romantic relationship with him.

Definitely not any time soon, but I think I will eventually tell him something such as, ""I respect whatever decision you want. But you deserve to be happy too. We both get along, even \[Child\] enjoys my company, we both love our time spent together, and we definitely find each other attractive. I'd be willing to do my best to get along with \[Child's Mom\] and prove that I'm not trying to replace her as the mom. The only difference between a romantic relationship and our current friendship is we would eventually live in the same home together. I've seen you for who you are, and I know you're the exact type of man that I want to be with. You already make me happy. So I would be willing to give you the loving relationship you deserve. I know you enough to say that I would never treat you with disrespect. If you're okay with it, I want to give you a lifetime of happiness that you deserve.""

Anyway, I came to Reddit because I think I am right to assume a romantic long-term relationship is possible. Or maybe I am being delusional? Currently, I'm assuming that his wording of *'FWB for now'* indicates that he would like to attempt a romantic relationship with me once he's stable and left one job for the other as he is planning to do so.",1,1770811598.0,relationships,3,0.99,False

The sales demo always looks perfect. The invoice is crisp, the layout is standard, and the OCR works 100%. Then you get to production, and reality hits: coffee stains, handwritten notes in margins, nested tables that span three pages, and 50 different file formats.

In 2026, ""OCR"" (just reading text) is a solved problem. But **IDP** (Intelligent Document Processing), actually understanding the context and structure of that text is still hard.

I’ve spent a lot of time evaluating the landscape for different use cases. I wanted to break down the top 10 players and, more importantly, **how to actually choose between them** based on your engineering resources and accuracy requirements.

# The Evaluation Framework

Before looking at tools, define your constraints:

1. **Complexity:** Are you processing standard W2s (easy) or 100-page unstructured legal contracts (hard)?
2. **Resources:** Do you have a dev team to train models (AWS/Azure), or do you need a managed outcome?
3. **Accuracy:** Is 90% okay (search indexing), or do you need 99.9% (financial payouts)?

# The Landscape: Categorized by Use Case

I’ve grouped the top 10 solutions based on who they are actually built for.

# 1. The Cloud Giants (Best for: Builders & Dev Teams)

If you want to build your own app and just need an API to handle the extraction, go here. You pay per page, but you handle the logic.

* **Microsoft Azure AI Document Intelligence:** Great integration if you are already in the Azure ecosystem. Strong pre-built models for receipts/IDs.
* **AWS IDP (Textract + Bedrock):** Very powerful but requires orchestration. You are glueing together Textract (OCR), Comprehend (NLP), and Bedrock (GenAI) yourself.
* **Google Document AI:** Strong on the ""GenAI"" front. Their Custom Document Extractor is good at learning from small sample sizes (few-shot learning).

# 2. The Specialized Platforms (Best for: Finance/Transactions)

These are purpose-built for specific document types (mostly invoices/PO processing).

* **Rossum:** Uses a ""template-free"" approach. Great for transactional documents where layouts change often, but the data fields (Total, Tax, Date) remain the same.
* **Docsumo:** Solid for SMBs/Mid-market. Good for financial document automation with a friendly UI.

# 3. The Heavyweights (Best for: Legacy Enterprise & RPA)

* **UiPath IXP:** If you are already doing RPA (Robotic Process Automation), this is the natural choice. It integrates document extraction directly into your bots.
* **ABBYY Vantage:** The veteran. They have been doing OCR forever. Excellent recognition engine, but can feel ""heavier"" to implement than newer cloud-native tools.

# 4. The Deep Tech (Best for: Handwriting & Structure)

* **Hyperscience:** They use a proprietary architecture (Hypercell) that is exceptionally good at handwriting and messy forms. If you process handwritten insurance claims, look here.

# 5. The ""Simple"" Tool (Best for: Basic Needs)

* **Docparser:** A no-code, rule-based tool. If you have simple, structured PDFs that never change layout, this is the cheapest and easiest way to get data into Excel.

# 6. The Managed / Agentic AI Approach (Best for: High Accuracy & Scale)

* **Forage AI:** This category is for when you don't want to build a pipeline, you just want the data. It uses ""Agentic AI"" (AI agents that can self-correct) combined with human-in-the-loop validation. Best for complex, unstructured documents where 99%+ accuracy is non-negotiable and still process millions of unstructured variety of documents.

# The ""Golden Rule"" for POCs

If you are running a Proof of Concept (POC) with any of these vendors, **do not use clean data.**

Every vendor can extract data from a perfect digital PDF. To find the breaking point, you need to test:

* **Bad Scans:** Skewed, low DPI, faxed pages.
* **Mixed Input:** Forms that are half-typed, half-handwritten.
* **Multi-Page Tables:** Tables that break across pages without headers repeating.

**TL;DR Summary:**

* Building a product? Use **Azure/AWS/Google**.
* Simple parsing? Use **Docparser**.
* Messy handwriting? Use **Hyperscience**.
* Need guaranteed 99% accuracy/outsourced pipeline at large scale? Use **Forage AI**.
* Already using RPA? Use **UiPath**.

Happy to answer questions on the specific architecture differences between these—there is a massive difference between ""Template-based"" and ""LLM-based"" extraction that is worth diving into if people are interested.",2,1770811502.0,LanguageTechnology,2,1.0,False
1r1vko5,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworking_spaces/comments/1r1vko5/why_businesses_are_moving_to_workafella/,Why Businesses Are Moving to Workafella: Redefining Workspaces in Banjara Hills,"The way companies think about offices has changed dramatically. Businesses today are not simply searching for square footage they are looking for environments that inspire teams, support growth, and reflect their ambitions. Hyderabad, with its fast-growing commercial ecosystem, has become a magnet for organisations seeking exactly this kind of transformation.

1r1vfjd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r1vfjd,Earacoustic Audio Genesis G318s A Vinyl Analogue Experience,"Earacoustic Genesis G318s A Vinyl Analogue Experience

Another week another review. This time around it's redux of Earacoustic Audio. The model is Genesis G318s. I had seen post by Earacoustic about it on FB so naturally was interested in reviewing it. My desire got fulfilled when AudioGeek India got review tour unit & I instantly made sure I got my paws on it. This name is based on scenic route in PRC which is renowned for its scenic beauty. This naming is used to describe how it would feel while listening to music. A pleasant old style analogue tuning. Is it the same or not ? Well read on to find out.  

First of all mighty thanks to Sandeep Bhai the Man behind AudioGeek and to Earacoustic Audio for this opportunity. Without their help this review wouldn't be possible. 

I have not been paid or been compensated in any kind or manner to review this product. All opinions and thoughts are mine.

Now that all pleasantries have been exchanged Let's proceed with the meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Retail package is nothing short of amazing. You get outer sleeve with product photo and details. Inner box has IEM shells, nice case, 4.4mm 0.78mm 2 pin cable and ear tips in plastic case. There two types of ear tips here. One is wide bore black color silicone tip and other is spiral ear tips. (if you are old timer in this hobby you would remember these were offered with some IEMs back in the days) 

Shells are made up of metal. The design on them is interesting and looks handmade. Is it so or not have no idea. They feel like jewelry piece and feel premium. Provided cable has cloth sheathing. 4.4mm jack and 0.78 mm 2 pin connectors are made up of metal. Cable separator is also made up of metal. Pre formed ear hooks on the cable look pretty aggressive. 

Provided case is premium. In my opinion one of the best or only one under 200-250 USD IEM carry case period. 

Best part is on outer box they print/engrave buyers name on metal plate that is glued to box. This feels like custom gift or product. This is nice touch by Earacoustic.

Entire packaging & build quality screams premium. 

Overall Build quality 5/5.  

Comfort :

The shells are huge. So fitting is issue and shape feels bit odd in ears. You have to get used to it. Shells are not heavy so weight of them in ear is no issue. Nozzle is bit stubby i.e. Short . So deep insertion is not possible. Nozzles have lip on them so no ear tip slip offs. Shells didn't create any weird pressure or pain in the ear but shell size being huge your mileage might vary.

Provided ear tips are soft and provide great seal. They don't fold and hold earpieces in ears properly. 

Cable is stiff and has its own memory. Its difficult to roadie wrap. Yet it is manageable. Ear hooks are very aggressively molded. They affect the in ear fitting you have to fight with them and shape them.

Overall comfort is good but marred by and made conditional due to the shell size and the cable.

Overall Comfort 4/5   

Configuration :

8.3 mm Dual magnetic circuit & dual cavity Titanium dome. Diamond diaphragm. Impedance is 38 Ohms. Sensitivity 110 dB. Frequency range 20-20 Khz. 0.78mm 2 pin 4.4 mm balanced OFC cable with 48 braided shielding. 

Ear Tips : 

I have used stock wide bore tips with for this review.

This iem is very efficient (110dB ) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, Onix Alpha XI 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze, shanling M1 plus.

I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn't like presentation with bright sources. 

Song Impressions :

To corelate my findings with actual song impressions I have included few song impressions.

Sada kalo Prem

This song has many instruments such as accordion, organ, piano, guitars. All sound excellent and natural. But the real USP is vocals. Both male and female vocals sound great and natural. Female vocals are key point to focus here and this set nails 100%. Female singer sounds amazing and intimate. You just get lost in them. You don't want to stop. The mix is ethereal here. Great reproduction.

When The Levee Breaks by 

Starting drum sequence is rendered beautifully by this set. There are multiple instruments are playing at the same time. Such as drums, guitars, shakers, mouth organ etc. It doesn't get intense and no smearing or congestion is felt. Cymbal crashes are great and sound natural. Vocals sound natural and as they should be. I had blast listening to this song. I couldn't stop myself from air drumming and feet stomping. Great reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack

 This song has sub bass droning in entire song. That is greatly reproduced here. You can hear it and you can feel it. As this set has amazing sub bass. The mid bass thump is satisfactory. Vocals sound natural. Drums, kick drums and guitars all sound great. Specifically the reverberations you feel when the drums are struck and strings are strummed. This song can get intense but no such thing here. The resolving capabilities do justice. This set passes this test with flying colors. Great experience.

Think U the shit by Ice spice

This is for genre check. Drum beats are on point. Ice spice sounds like her with all her peculiarities. Vocals don't get suppressed in the mix. I must have heard this song for like few hundreds of time and it feels great on this set.  Song flows like it was meant for this set. Wide soundstage makes the song feel immersive. For me this was exceptional experience.

I like this set so much that I wanted to put in more song impressions but then this would have turned in to thesis paper and I didn't want to bore everyone so I will stop here.

Final Conclusion :

I have been fan of TFZ and with Earacoustic they have taken that DNA and now refined it. It is evident with each release. First I heard Spa Hiend and then VSA Max and followed by VSA PM. With SPA Hiend and VSA Max I felt the soundstage and treble extension were bit of chink in armor. Now in the Genesis they have addressed both the issues. It has Earcoustics Bass and vocals and now finally treble that can remedy all my issues. This is a perfect evolution for their portfolio. I think this is one of the best single DD set till date from Earcoustics period.

It creates nice atmospheric feel. Sound just envelopes you. Analogue musical nature makes it enjoyable set. This set is for enjoying music in analogue style. This is not for analytical listening. I can't describe with words how much I like this set. I feel like Earacoustic has created set for me. This set paired with warm and neutral sources is heavenly pleasure. It evokes so may emotions while listening, they just envelope you. Instruments come alive. Vocals pluck strings in your heart. It becomes musical odyssey once they are in my ears.

I think I am over selling this set. Yes cause I love it so much so that I bought my own set. Please understand my bias towards single DD sets. This set proves that a well tuned single DD can show its supremacy in tone & timbre. Now fan boying aside yes, this set has its negatives. No set is perfect. It has issues such as shell size, cable microphonics and not being modular and for some the tuning choice etc. We have to accept that no set is perfect. It just depends on you what you can accept and can't. 

Now for whom is this set meant for ? If you love V/U shaped tuning this is for you. Bass lovers if sub bass lovers yay! If mid bass lovers maybe. For treble heads its near territory but again maybe . But both of them will not regret getting it. Neutral lovers this is definitely not for you. This is too colored for you. 

I hope I have created a proper picture of this set. Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now go grab a cup of coffee and Let's get high on safe high i.e. Music.

Johnny walked into Gus's diner at 6:30 the next morning, same as always. It gave him a half hour to get himself together before his shift started. He poured himself a cup of hot coffee, added a little cream and a teaspoon of sugar, and sat at the counter thumbing through his phone to check his emails.

The bell jingled—light and sweet, like Christmas chimes.

He looked up. Holly.

Tall and slim with the figure of a Swedish bikini model and the face of a cover girl. If Michele was jealous, she had reason to be.

Holly put her arm around Johnny's shoulder and leaned in close, pretending to check his phone.

""Nothing from me in there, huh. Give me your number, handsome, and I'll send you a picture of me every night—something to think about before you go to sleep.""

""Well then, give me your phone and we'll exchange numbers. Here's mine."" He slid it across the counter.

""Wow. You're serious. What about your girlfriend? I got a very possessive vibe from her yesterday when I asked you to help me with my zipper.""

""First off, she was never my girlfriend. Maybe she was for one night, but it was very fleeting. Believe me—she doesn't care.""

""What about you? Do you care?""

""Doesn't matter if I care or not. Why are we talking about her anyway?""

""Just making conversation, I guess,"" Holly said, handing him her phone and taking his. ""Here ya go.""

She took hers back, smiled.

""Now that we have each other's numbers, why don't we celebrate Saturday by going out together? How about a movie and Chinese food after?""

""Sounds good to me. I've been wanting to go out with you since I started here. Didn't think you were available.""

""I'm available. I'm as available as it gets.""

Holly went in the back and changed into her work dress. Johnny tied his apron around his waist as the clock struck seven and work began.

That evening, Katie persuaded Michele to go with her to The Well Bar, an intimate space on the lower level of the Rotunda at the Schwarzman Center.

They sat at a table off to the side, each ordering a martini. Neither cared if it was shaken or stirred.

The waitress placed them on the table with napkins. ""Let me know when you're ready for another round.""

They clicked glasses.

""Here's to you and Harold Saturday,"" Katie said. To new beginnings.""

""To new beginnings,"" Michele repeated, trying her hardest to sound excited. ""I'm a little thrown off today. Went to the dining hall for my coffee and muffin. Decided to stay on campus. Better to avoid the townies.""

""You're really serious about this, aren't you? Good for you, then. I just want you to be happy, Michele. Enough with the Meryl Streep drama scenes. I've had my fill of them.""

""Like I haven't. Let's hope Harold and I hit it off. I think I'm ready for a steady relationship with a serious guy, you know?""

""Harold. What kind of a name is Harold?""

""Harold Stein. Jewish. I have an Uncle Harold—he's a dentist. Makes things easier. We can be buried together.""

Katie laughed. ""Union League Café. That's a swanky place. Real bougie. Harold's trying to make a good impression.""

""Yeah. That, or he just wants to get into my pants. He's a trust fund baby—comes from old money. His great-grandfather started a trading house in St. Louis back in the twenties.""

""He told you all this already?"" Katie asked.

""No, I got it from Carol. They're both pre-law buddies.""

""Well, good luck,"" said Katie, clicking their glasses. ""This one's definitely in your league.""

Michele put her head down. Her eyes welled up, but she held back the tears.

""Oh no,"" Katie said. ""What now?""

""That just reminded me of Johnny,"" Michele said, voice choked. ""I behaved so shitty to him, you know.""

""Stop. Remember—no more Meryl Streep. We agreed.""

""Okay. I promise,"" Michele said, forcing a smile.

""Katie? That you?""

Katie looked up to see Quentin Quarles standing beside their table, all height and charm. The Yale point guard smiled like he knew exactly the effect he had.

""Yeah, it's me. Thought you forgot. Haven't texted me in two weeks.""

""Works both ways, you know,"" he replied, mock-defensive.

""You know my friend Michele. She's the one you inconvenience with your presence when you sleep over.""

""Hi, Michele. Nice to finally make your acquaintance. I'd rather call it a noble sacrifice than an inconvenience."" He grinned. ""So what are you ladies up to tonight?""

""Just chilling out, drinking martinis, and talking about what inconsiderate Neanderthals men can be,"" Katie said.

Quentin sat down right next to Katie, sliding his chair close and looking directly into her green eyes.

""Sounds like someone's got some serious issues with me right now. How about you let me make it up to you?""

""No chance,"" Katie said. ""I'm not kicking Michele out on a school night.""

""We'll go to my place,"" Quentin said. ""Roommate's pulling an all-nighter elsewhere. I've got the room to myself.""

""Oh, just go, Katie. You deserve a free night without my drama. I'll be fine. I've got great comfort food—Oreos and milk. Touch of Evil dropped on Netflix tonight. Johnny got me hooked on noirs now.""

""You sure?""

Michele gave her a nod and a smile.

""Okay,"" Katie said, standing. She grabbed Quentin's hand. ""Lead on.""

""Yes!"" Quentin said excitedly.

They left arm in arm.

Michele finished her martini slowly, left a five-dollar tip on the table, and headed back to the dorm alone—grateful, at least, that she wouldn't be sharing a bed with Carol again tonight.

Chapter 13

Johnny pulled up in front of Holly's building on Saturday night. It was a five-story walk-up in the middle of New Haven, the kind of block that could double as the backdrop for his first shadowy noir novel.

Holly lived in apartment 2B with her cousin Patricia. They were both local beauties, picking up freelance modeling work while hoping to land a contract with one of the big agencies.

Patricia was a couple of years older, which is why her name was on the lease. She stood about five-nine, all angles and confidence, with stunning good looks that reminded Johnny of a young Jennifer Connelly.

Johnny climbed the steps slowly, careful not to break a sweat. He wore an untucked white dress shirt, pleated Dockers, and a comfortable pair of Rockport shoes. He took a deep breath, rapped twice on the door with his knuckles, and heard heels clicking across hardwood.

The door opened and he actually gasped.

Holly stood there in a pink crepe mini dress. He couldn't help but look her up and down. Her legs were slim and toned, her stomach flat enough you could bounce a quarter off it. Her straight blonde hair looked ironed smooth, falling neatly halfway down her back.

""Come on in,"" she said with a wide smile. ""This is my cousin and roommate Patricia. You can think of her as my surrogate mom.""

""Don't tell him that,"" Patricia said, entering the living room. ""Makes me sound ancient. I've only got a couple of years on her.""

Johnny shook her hand. ""Nice place you ladies have. I like it.""

""Well, it's not that great,"" Patricia said. ""The toilet won't flush and the super says he can't come until tomorrow. Told me to pour a bucket of water in it.""

""Oh yeah? Let me take a look.""

Johnny rolled up his sleeves, lifted the tank lid, and checked the chain connecting the handle to the flapper. It wasn't broken—just loose. He reattached the small metal hook to the lever arm, tested it once, and the toilet flushed perfectly.

""Is he something or what?"" Holly said to Patricia, like she'd just unwrapped a prize.

""Oh my God, yes,"" Patricia said. ""Dimples to die for and handy. If you paint the living room, you can sleep with both of us.""

""Hold it, cuz,"" Holly said, laughing. ""Get your own dreamboat. This one's mine.""

""We should get going,"" Johnny said, glancing at his watch. ""The movie starts soon.""

""What are you seeing?"" Patricia asked.

""I like the Retro Theater on Helms Street,"" Johnny said. ""I write a biweekly movie review for the Hill Eagle. The Two Mrs. Carrolls is playing—one of the great film noirs. Figured I'd mix a little business with pleasure.""

""Film what?"" Holly asked, skeptical.

""It's a dark crime drama,"" Johnny said. ""Trust me—you'll love it.""

""If you don't wanna go, I do,"" Patricia said.

""Let's get outta here,"" Holly said, looping her arm through Johnny's. ""Don't wait up, Patty.""

""Yeah, have fun,"" Patricia laughed. ""I'll be bar-hopping later. Maybe I'll steal him.""

Johnny helped Holly carefully down the stairs in her heels. He'd parked a block away, and they walked arm in arm toward the theater.

Holly turned heads. Johnny noticed the looks she drew and found it more amusing than threatening. It was too early in the game for jealousy.

The Retro Theater was exactly what you'd expect—bright marquee, faded charm. It never played first-run films. Just classics, cult favorites, horror flicks, and documentaries.

Holly scanned the posters and frowned.

""It's not even in color. When was this made?""

""1947.""

""1947?"" she groaned. ""You took me to a movie where everyone's dead? This is something my grandparents watch while she knits and he dozes off.""

""Give it a chance,"" Johnny said. ""Michele wasn't into them either at first. Now she can't get enough.""

""Can't we see Love in Real Time? Paul Mescal looks adorable.""

""I can't. I already committed to this, and I've got a deadline tomorrow.""

""Oh, fine. But if I nod off like Grandpa, don't say I didn't warn you.""

They couldn't have reacted more differently. Johnny sat forward, absorbed in the tension and performances—Stanwyck sharp, Bogart dangerous.

Holly leaned her head on his shoulder halfway through and whispered, ""Wake me when it's over.""

Johnny let her stay there, but it made him uncomfortable. She wasn't even trying.

When Bogart finally crashed through the bedroom window and the police burst in, Johnny clapped instinctively. Holly jolted awake.

""I hope that means it's over,"" she yawned.

""That was incredible,"" Johnny said. ""The king and queen of noir.""

""I'm not sorry I missed it. I'm starving. Let's eat.""

They went to Kung Fu Palace. The smell hit him immediately—garlic, ginger, soy sauce—and for a second he was back at that first date with Michele, watching her smile across the table. He shook it off.

It was the same table Johnny had shared with Michele weeks earlier.

""They make great pork lo mein here,"" Holly said. ""With hot and sour soup and a ton of duck sauce.""

Moi appeared, smiling at Johnny, surprised not to see Michele.

""Mai tai?"" he asked.

""Definitely,"" Holly said. ""After that snooze fest.""

""I'll have a light beer,"" Johnny said.

He missed talking about the movie the way he did with Michele—arguing themes, lines, meanings. With Michele, writing was shared ground. With Holly, it wasn't.

Holly demolished the fried noodles, asking for a refill before Moi had even turned away.

""Where do you put it all?"" Johnny laughed.

""Fast metabolism,"" she said. ""Patricia and I are lucky.""

""So you're serious about modeling?""

""Dead serious. Gus's is temporary. Patricia and I are heading to L.A. in a year.""

""How about you?""

""I'm living my dream,"" Johnny said. ""I've got a publishing deal. I'll be writing full-time soon.""

""Well,"" she smiled, ""I think we both make it.""

Johnny smiled back. There was more to her than he'd thought—but not enough.

After dinner, Holly finally said, ""Can I be honest?""

""Always.""

""You're in love with Michele. You can't hide it.""

Johnny exhaled. ""Is it that obvious?""

""Painfully. You light up when you talk about her.""

He nodded. ""Yeah. Guess I rushed things.""

""Well,"" Holly said, standing, ""let's find Patricia and have a drink. Tonight didn't turn out so bad.""

They laughed and stepped into the New Haven night, the city humming around them—two people walking in the same direction, already knowing they wouldn't end up at the same place.",1,1770811003.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

Another week another review. This time around it's redux of Earacoustic Audio. The model is Genesis G318s. I had seen post by Earacoustic about it on FB so naturally was interested in reviewing it. My desire got fulfilled when AudioGeek India got review tour unit & I instantly made sure I got my paws on it. This name is based on scenic route in PRC which is renowned for its scenic beauty. This naming is used to describe how it would feel while listening to music. A pleasant old style analogue tuning. Is it the same or not ? Well read on to find out.  

First of all mighty thanks to Sandeep Bhai the Man behind AudioGeek and to Earacoustic Audio for this opportunity. Without their help this review wouldn't be possible. 

I have not been paid or been compensated in any kind or manner to review this product. All opinions and thoughts are mine.

Now that all pleasantries have been exchanged Let's proceed with the meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Retail package is nothing short of amazing. You get outer sleeve with product photo and details. Inner box has IEM shells, nice case, 4.4mm 0.78mm 2 pin cable and ear tips in plastic case. There two types of ear tips here. One is wide bore black color silicone tip and other is spiral ear tips. (if you are old timer in this hobby you would remember these were offered with some IEMs back in the days) 

Shells are made up of metal. The design on them is interesting and looks handmade. Is it so or not have no idea. They feel like jewelry piece and feel premium. Provided cable has cloth sheathing. 4.4mm jack and 0.78 mm 2 pin connectors are made up of metal. Cable separator is also made up of metal. Pre formed ear hooks on the cable look pretty aggressive. 

Provided case is premium. In my opinion one of the best or only one under 200-250 USD IEM carry case period. 

Best part is on outer box they print/engrave buyers name on metal plate that is glued to box. This feels like custom gift or product. This is nice touch by Earacoustic.

Entire packaging & build quality screams premium. 

Overall Build quality 5/5.  

Comfort :

The shells are huge. So fitting is issue and shape feels bit odd in ears. You have to get used to it. Shells are not heavy so weight of them in ear is no issue. Nozzle is bit stubby i.e. Short . So deep insertion is not possible. Nozzles have lip on them so no ear tip slip offs. Shells didn't create any weird pressure or pain in the ear but shell size being huge your mileage might vary.

Provided ear tips are soft and provide great seal. They don't fold and hold earpieces in ears properly. 

Cable is stiff and has its own memory. Its difficult to roadie wrap. Yet it is manageable. Ear hooks are very aggressively molded. They affect the in ear fitting you have to fight with them and shape them.

Overall comfort is good but marred by and made conditional due to the shell size and the cable.

Overall Comfort 4/5   

Configuration :

8.3 mm Dual magnetic circuit & dual cavity Titanium dome. Diamond diaphragm. Impedance is 38 Ohms. Sensitivity 110 dB. Frequency range 20-20 Khz. 0.78mm 2 pin 4.4 mm balanced OFC cable with 48 braided shielding. 

Ear Tips : 

I have used stock wide bore tips with for this review.

This iem is very efficient (110dB ) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, Onix Alpha XI 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze, shanling M1 plus.

I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn't like presentation with bright sources. 

Song Impressions :

To corelate my findings with actual song impressions I have included few song impressions.

Sada kalo Prem

This song has many instruments such as accordion, organ, piano, guitars. All sound excellent and natural. But the real USP is vocals. Both male and female vocals sound great and natural. Female vocals are key point to focus here and this set nails 100%. Female singer sounds amazing and intimate. You just get lost in them. You don't want to stop. The mix is ethereal here. Great reproduction.

When The Levee Breaks by 

Starting drum sequence is rendered beautifully by this set. There are multiple instruments are playing at the same time. Such as drums, guitars, shakers, mouth organ etc. It doesn't get intense and no smearing or congestion is felt. Cymbal crashes are great and sound natural. Vocals sound natural and as they should be. I had blast listening to this song. I couldn't stop myself from air drumming and feet stomping. Great reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack

 This song has sub bass droning in entire song. That is greatly reproduced here. You can hear it and you can feel it. As this set has amazing sub bass. The mid bass thump is satisfactory. Vocals sound natural. Drums, kick drums and guitars all sound great. Specifically the reverberations you feel when the drums are struck and strings are strummed. This song can get intense but no such thing here. The resolving capabilities do justice. This set passes this test with flying colors. Great experience.

Think U the shit by Ice spice

This is for genre check. Drum beats are on point. Ice spice sounds like her with all her peculiarities. Vocals don't get suppressed in the mix. I must have heard this song for like few hundreds of time and it feels great on this set.  Song flows like it was meant for this set. Wide soundstage makes the song feel immersive. For me this was exceptional experience.

I like this set so much that I wanted to put in more song impressions but then this would have turned in to thesis paper and I didn't want to bore everyone so I will stop here.

Final Conclusion :

I have been fan of TFZ and with Earacoustic they have taken that DNA and now refined it. It is evident with each release. First I heard Spa Hiend and then VSA Max and followed by VSA PM. With SPA Hiend and VSA Max I felt the soundstage and treble extension were bit of chink in armor. Now in the Genesis they have addressed both the issues. It has Earcoustics Bass and vocals and now finally treble that can remedy all my issues. This is a perfect evolution for their portfolio. I think this is one of the best single DD set till date from Earcoustics period.

It creates nice atmospheric feel. Sound just envelopes you. Analogue musical nature makes it enjoyable set. This set is for enjoying music in analogue style. This is not for analytical listening. I can't describe with words how much I like this set. I feel like Earacoustic has created set for me. This set paired with warm and neutral sources is heavenly pleasure. It evokes so may emotions while listening, they just envelope you. Instruments come alive. Vocals pluck strings in your heart. It becomes musical odyssey once they are in my ears.

I think I am over selling this set. Yes cause I love it so much so that I bought my own set. Please understand my bias towards single DD sets. This set proves that a well tuned single DD can show its supremacy in tone & timbre. Now fan boying aside yes, this set has its negatives. No set is perfect. It has issues such as shell size, cable microphonics and not being modular and for some the tuning choice etc. We have to accept that no set is perfect. It just depends on you what you can accept and can't. 

Now for whom is this set meant for ? If you love V/U shaped tuning this is for you. Bass lovers if sub bass lovers yay! If mid bass lovers maybe. For treble heads its near territory but again maybe . But both of them will not regret getting it. Neutral lovers this is definitely not for you. This is too colored for you. 

I hope I have created a proper picture of this set. Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now go grab a cup of coffee and Let's get high on safe high i.e. Music.

1r1vdzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/EuropeDataTravel/comments/1r1vdzp/working_on_the_road_in_germany_reliable_wifi/,"Working on the Road in Germany: Reliable Wi-Fi, Solid Coffee and Coworking That Actually Helps You Get Stuff Done","Here’s the thing about Germany. After moving around a bit, testing random cafés and coworking spaces, I stopped guessing where to work. Most cities are set up well enough that you can actually rely on the infrastructure. The WiFi is usually solid, and you’re not forced to drink bad coffee just to get a few hours in.

I used to rotate between Airbnb desks and cafés, hoping the connection would survive a Zoom call. Sometimes it did, sometimes it didn’t. That’s when coworking spaces started making more sense. Stable internet, proper desks, outlets everywhere, and coffee that’s actually decent. It removes the daily friction.

Berlin feels built for this. The remote work crowd is big enough that most coworking spots just work. Betahaus is consistent, good connection, flexible seating, café downstairs that makes staying all day easy. Factory Berlin leans startup, but that usually means reliable WiFi and people who understand work mode. Even places like St. Oberholz are casual but dependable if you just need a few focused hours.

Munich is calmer, which helps if you’re trying to get into a rhythm. Mindspace and Design Offices aren’t cheap, but they’re predictable. Strong WiFi, comfortable setups, no drama. You can focus and leave without feeling drained.

Hamburg surprised me in a good way. Bright spaces, good coffee, steady connections. WeWork is consistent, and betahaus Hamburg has a more relaxed feel while still covering the basics.

Germany might not be the dream postcard nomad destination, but if your priority is actually getting work done, it delivers. Stable internet, real desks, solid coffee. After wasting enough time on shaky WiFi and disappointing espresso, that combination starts to matter more than anything else.

Curious if anyone’s found a low key café or coworking spot here that really gets the balance right.",1,1770810889.0,EuropeDataTravel,0,1.0,False

After work, Johnny jogged home toward his apartment, his mind slipping back into high school wrestling mode. He could practically hear Coach Skolnick behind him, barking orders.

""LEGS HIGHER, SENSA—LET'S GO, DOUBLE TIME!""

Before he realized it, he'd broken into a full sprint, dodging oncoming pedestrians on instinct, barely aware of them as he blew past.

He took the stairs two at a time, keys already in hand, shoved the door open, and dropped face-down on the living room floor. He launched straight into push-ups—form be damned—fast and punishing, chasing the adrenaline spike, the dopamine hit, the burn that shut everything else up.

He was three reps shy of a hundred when a voice cut through the room.

""What the fuck, Johnny? The whole apartment's shaking like we're having an earthquake. My lava lamp fell off the headboard and nearly decapitated me.""

Michael stood in the doorway of his bedroom wearing nothing but boxer shorts.

Johnny collapsed onto his back, chest heaving. ""Sorry. Didn't know what I was doing. Just burning off steam.""

""What's all the commotion out here?"" Frances asked, appearing behind Michael. She was wearing his gym shorts and one of his T-shirts, the hem brushing her thighs.

Johnny sat up, suddenly aware of himself. ""Did I interrupt something? Sorry. I didn't mean to.""

""Well, what brought this on?"" Michael said. ""Let me guess.""

""You don't have to guess,"" Johnny said. He peeled off his shirt and wrung the sweat out into the kitchen sink. ""It's her. It's always her. Even when I agree with her, it sets her off."" He stopped himself. ""She drives me crazy.""

""Girl troubles,"" Frances said lightly. ""I've got at least ten friends who'd cut off a pinky toe for a date with you.""

""Not Michele. Ms. Valedictorian."" Johnny shook his head. ""I'm never good enough for her. I thought she'd be happy about the publishing deal. Thought it might finally make her look at me differently. Stop looking down at me.""

""Did you ever think maybe she's just not that into you?"" Michael said.

""I don't see how that's even possible,"" Frances said, unable to stop staring at Johnny—shirtless, flushed, still pumped from the push-ups.

""All right, knock it off,"" Michael said dryly. ""Bad enough he interrupted us. I don't need him being a distraction too.""

Johnny didn't smile. ""I figured maybe she was right. That it'd never work. So I tried to be an adult about it. Told her maybe we should just be friends.""

""And?"" Michael asked.

""She told me to put her coffee and muffin in a bag because she was in a hurry.""

""So what did you do?""

""I put her coffee and muffin in a bag."" Johnny shrugged. ""Rolled it shut. Handed it to her."" He paused. ""She usually gives me her poem for the Yale News to read. Every week. The last one was about me. Gave me hope."" He exhaled. ""Now I think it was her way of letting me down.""

Frances frowned. ""Did you do anything that might've set her off?""

Johnny thought for a moment. ""She sat down—usual stool. She was smiling. Like she had something to tell me.""

""Okay,"" Frances said. ""And then?""

""Holly came out of the kitchen. The new waitress Gus hired. She asked me to help her with the zipper on her dress.""

Frances leaned forward. ""The zipper was mostly up, right? You just finished it off? It wasn't all the way down where you could see her underwear, was it?""

""They were pink,"" Johnny said, genuinely confused. ""What's that got to do with anything?""

""I don't know yet,"" Frances said slowly. ""This Holly—does she look like one of your mom's aunts? The matronly type?""

""No. She's tall. Slender. Nineteen, maybe. Nothing like Aunt Mimi.""

Michael had been watching the exchange quietly, following the thread. Now he stepped in.

""Johnny, let me ask you something. Do you love this girl? And do you want to be with her?""

Johnny dropped his head between his bent knees.

""Yes. I love her. And I'd cut off a pinky toe to be with her.""

""Then call her,"" Michael said. ""Tell her that. Stop torturing yourself.""

Johnny grabbed his phone from the coffee table and started dialing. Just before it rang, he stopped. Hung up. He stood, took a breath, tried to steady himself.

""No. I can't keep doing this."" He shook his head. ""I'm done trying to impress her. Maybe I need to move on. Find someone blue-collar like me. Someone in my league."" He forced a shrug. ""Maybe I'll see if Holly's free Friday.""

Michael studied him. ""If that's what you want, then do it. But if you do—no looking back.""

""Now,"" Michael added, turning toward the bedroom, ""if you don't mind, we'd like to finish what we started before we were so rudely interrupted.""

""No,"" Frances said flatly. ""The moment passed. Johnny's story depressed me. Besides, I'm hungry. Let's get pancakes.""

""Great,"" Michael muttered. ""Not only are you screwing up your love life, Johnny—now you're screwing up mine.""

Chapter 11

Katie pushed open the dorm door and froze.

Michele was face-down in her pillow, shoulders shaking, mascara streaking dark trails down her cheeks.

""Oh my God, Michele—honey, what's wrong?"" Katie dropped her bag and sat on the edge of the bed, gently pulling Michele up into a hug.

Michele buried her face in Katie's shoulder, voice muffled and thick with tears. ""It's over, Katie. It's really over now. I went to the diner today so happy—like my whole life was ahead of me. I couldn't wait for him to read the poem. I wrote it for us. A beginning.""

Katie stroked her hair. ""I don't understand. Didn't he like it?""

""He never even got the chance."" Michele pulled back, wiping her face with the heel of her hand. ""Just as I reached into my bag to hand it to him, this slim, blonde Barbie-doll waitress—Holly—comes out of the kitchen looking like she stepped off OnlyFans. She pins her hair up and purrs, 'Johnny, will you be a darling and help me with my zipper? This dress is new—I haven't broken it in yet.'""

Katie's eyes widened. ""She asked him to zip her up? In front of you?""

""Yep. And he did. Turned right around, pulled it up to the nape of her neck like it was the most important job in the world. 'There you go, Holly.' 'Aw, thank you, sweetheart.'"" Michele's voice hardened. ""I swear, Katie, he lingered. I saw his face—he was ogling her back. Not just looking. Ogling.""

Katie stood, poured Michele a glass of water from the mini-fridge, and handed it over. ""Take a drink. Breathe. I'm sure he just finished the zipper and turned right back to you. That's what happened, right?""

Michele took a shaky sip. ""Yeah. But then it gets worse. He puts his hands on the counter and says he's been thinking about what I've been telling him, and I'm right. We're from different worlds. My dad's a judge, his is a house painter. He's blue-collar all the way. He doesn't know what he was thinking—we could never make it as a couple. It wasn't meant to be.""

Katie stared. ""He said that? After everything?""

Michele nodded, fresh tears spilling. ""I wanted to punch him in that perfect nose. Or grab Holly by her ponytail and yank. But I just told him to put my coffee and muffin in a bag because I was in a hurry. He looked disappointed—like I'd kicked him. Asked about the poem. Said he was looking forward to reading it.""

""And you?""

""I lied. Said I hadn't finished it. That it needed a rewrite. That it was irrelevant now.""

Katie exhaled slowly. ""Michele... this sounds like a huge misunderstanding. If I were you, I'd call him. Meet at a bar, get a table, talk it out over drinks. You can go back to his place this time.""

""I can't, Katie."" Michele's voice cracked. ""I'm too angry. Worse—I'm humiliated. I was ready to hand him my heart on a page. Instead I get the just-friends speech.""

Michele broke down again, crying into Katie's shoulder. Katie held her tight, saying nothing, just letting her get it out.

After a few minutes, Michele sat up, wiped her face, and went into the bathroom. She turned on the tap, splashed cold water over her burning cheeks, the shock of it stinging her swollen eyes. She gripped the edge of the sink until her knuckles went white, forced herself to breathe, then brushed her hair back with shaking hands. When she came out, she looked composed—but her eyes were still red, her throat raw.

Katie watched as Michele opened her desk drawer and pulled out a crumpled napkin.

""What's that?"" Katie asked.

""A phone number,"" Michele said. ""I met a law student last week in the dining hall—Harold Stein. Carol introduced us. Nice enough. He plays golf. My dad plays golf.""

Katie's eyebrows rose. ""So what are you thinking?""

""A clean break."" Michele unfolded the napkin. ""I thought Johnny was the fresh start. Maybe he was cursed from the beginning. Maybe I was right—we're too different.""

Katie sighed, throwing up her arms. ""Here we go again.""

Michele was already dialing.

""Hi, Harold? It's Michele—from the dining hall.""

A pause. She smiled faintly.

""I've been busy with classes... but I'll be free Saturday night.""

Another pause.

""Union League Café? Fancy. I love French food. I'll be ready at eight. See you then.""

She ended the call, looked at Katie, and said, ""Now that's what I call a clean break.""

Katie studied her for a long moment, then shook her head.

""If you're trying to convince yourself this is a win, Michele... you're doing a terrible job.""

Michele didn't answer. She just stared at the phone in her hand, the napkin crumpled beside it, and felt the weight of what she'd just done settle in her chest.

It didn't feel clean at all.",1,1770810845.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

For my capstone project for my industrial design program, I was thinking of making attachments for a single hand and bi lateral hand amputated limb socket.

these attachments would be for some sort of application, for ex for coffee making.

I was wondering, do modular sockets and attachments exist already? if so, can you link me to some companies in this space?

also, is there anything you can tell me about this idea that would help?

pls and ty 😊

Another week another review. This time around it's redux of Earacoustic Audio. The model is Genesis G318s. I had seen post by Earacoustic about it on FB so naturally was interested in reviewing it. My desire got fulfilled when AudioGeek India got review tour unit & I instantly made sure I got my paws on it. This name is based on scenic route in PRC which is renowned for its scenic beauty. This naming is used to describe how it would feel while listening to music. A pleasant old style analogue tuning. Is it the same or not ? Well read on to find out.  

First of all mighty thanks to Sandeep Bhai the Man behind AudioGeek and to Earacoustic Audio for this opportunity. Without their help this review wouldn't be possible. 

I have not been paid or been compensated in any kind or manner to review this product. All opinions and thoughts are mine.

Now that all pleasantries have been exchanged Let's proceed with the meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Retail package is nothing short of amazing. You get outer sleeve with product photo and details. Inner box has IEM shells, nice case, 4.4mm 0.78mm 2 pin cable and ear tips in plastic case. There two types of ear tips here. One is wide bore black color silicone tip and other is spiral ear tips. (if you are old timer in this hobby you would remember these were offered with some IEMs back in the days) 

Shells are made up of metal. The design on them is interesting and looks handmade. Is it so or not have no idea. They feel like jewelry piece and feel premium. Provided cable has cloth sheathing. 4.4mm jack and 0.78 mm 2 pin connectors are made up of metal. Cable separator is also made up of metal. Pre formed ear hooks on the cable look pretty aggressive. 

Provided case is premium. In my opinion one of the best or only one under 200-250 USD IEM carry case period. 

Best part is on outer box they print/engrave buyers name on metal plate that is glued to box. This feels like custom gift or product. This is nice touch by Earacoustic.

Entire packaging & build quality screams premium. 

Overall Build quality 5/5.  

Comfort :

The shells are huge. So fitting is issue and shape feels bit odd in ears. You have to get used to it. Shells are not heavy so weight of them in ear is no issue. Nozzle is bit stubby i.e. Short . So deep insertion is not possible. Nozzles have lip on them so no ear tip slip offs. Shells didn't create any weird pressure or pain in the ear but shell size being huge your mileage might vary.

Provided ear tips are soft and provide great seal. They don't fold and hold earpieces in ears properly. 

Cable is stiff and has its own memory. Its difficult to roadie wrap. Yet it is manageable. Ear hooks are very aggressively molded. They affect the in ear fitting you have to fight with them and shape them.

Overall comfort is good but marred by and made conditional due to the shell size and the cable.

Overall Comfort 4/5   

Configuration :

8.3 mm Dual magnetic circuit & dual cavity Titanium dome. Diamond diaphragm. Impedance is 38 Ohms. Sensitivity 110 dB. Frequency range 20-20 Khz. 0.78mm 2 pin 4.4 mm balanced OFC cable with 48 braided shielding.

This iem is very efficient (110dB ) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, Onix Alpha XI 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze, shanling M1 plus.

I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn't like presentation with bright sources. 

Song Impressions :

To corelate my findings with actual song impressions I have included few song impressions.

Sada kalo Prem

This song has many instruments such as accordion, organ, piano, guitars. All sound excellent and natural. But the real USP is vocals. Both male and female vocals sound great and natural. Female vocals are key point to focus here and this set nails 100%. Female singer sounds amazing and intimate. You just get lost in them. You don't want to stop. The mix is ethereal here. Great reproduction.

When The Levee Breaks 

Starting drum sequence is rendered beautifully by this set. There are multiple instruments are playing at the same time. Such as drums, guitars, shakers, mouth organ etc. It doesn't get intense and no smearing or congestion is felt. Cymbal crashes are great and sound natural. Vocals sound natural and as they should be. I had blast listening to this song. I couldn't stop myself from air drumming and feet stomping. Great reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack

 This song has sub bass droning in entire song. That is greatly reproduced here. You can hear it and you can feel it. As this set has amazing sub bass. The mid bass thump is satisfactory. Vocals sound natural. Drums, kick drums and guitars all sound great. Specifically the reverberations you feel when the drums are struck and strings are strummed. This song can get intense but no such thing here. The resolving capabilities do justice. This set passes this test with flying colors. Great experience.

Think U the shit by Ice spice

This is for genre check. Drum beats are on point. Ice spice sounds like her with all her peculiarities. Vocals don't get suppressed in the mix. I must have heard this song for like few hundreds of time and it feels great on this set.  Song flows like it was meant for this set. Wide soundstage makes the song feel immersive. For me this was exceptional experience.

I like this set so much that I wanted to put in more song impressions but then this would have turned in to thesis paper and I didn't want to bore everyone so I will stop here.

Final Conclusion :

I have been fan of TFZ and with Earacoustic they have taken that DNA and now refined it. It is evident with each release. First I heard Spa Hiend and then VSA Max and followed by VSA PM. With SPA Hiend and VSA Max I felt the soundstage and treble extension were bit of chink in armor. Now in the Genesis they have addressed both the issues. It has Earcoustics Bass and vocals and now finally treble that can remedy all my issues. This is a perfect evolution for their portfolio. I think this is one of the best single DD set till date from Earcoustics period.

It creates nice atmospheric feel. Sound just envelopes you. Analogue musical nature makes it enjoyable set. This set is for enjoying music in analogue style. This is not for analytical listening. I can't describe with words how much I like this set. I feel like Earacoustic has created set for me. This set paired with warm and neutral sources is heavenly pleasure. It evokes so may emotions while listening, they just envelope you. Instruments come alive. Vocals pluck strings in your heart. It becomes musical odyssey once they are in my ears.

I think I am over selling this set. Yes cause I love it so much so that I bought my own set. Please understand my bias towards single DD sets. This set proves that a well tuned single DD can show its supremacy in tone & timbre. Now fan boying aside yes, this set has its negatives. No set is perfect. It has issues such as shell size, cable microphonics and not being modular and for some the tuning choice etc. We have to accept that no set is perfect. It just depends on you what you can accept and can't. 

Now for whom is this set meant for ? If you love V/U shaped tuning this is for you. Bass lovers if sub bass lovers yay! If mid bass lovers maybe. For treble heads its near territory but again maybe . But both of them will not regret getting it. Neutral lovers this is definitely not for you. This is too colored for you. 

I hope I have created a proper picture of this set. Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now go grab a cup of coffee and Let's get high on safe high i.e. Music.

Michele adjusted her book bag on her shoulder and crossed campus toward English Literature, already uneasy about how unprepared she was. She hadn't read the assigned chapters of The Forsyte Saga, and the research paper on plotting and structure hovered over her like a gathering storm.

Even so, she couldn't force her mind onto Galsworthy. The weekend had been a slow burn of anger and confusion: Johnny leaving her alone in bed at five in the morning to go sling hash after a night of passionate, mind-blowing sex. And then—salt in the wound—when she'd finally walked into Gus's on Monday ready to make him squirm, he'd turned the tables completely. Not only were they publishing his short-story collection, they were giving him an advance on a novel.

If anyone should be getting an advance, it should be me, she thought bitterly. She was number one in her class, for God's sake.

Her head stayed down as she walked, students veering out of her path at the last second. Her thoughts ran in an endless loop: the humiliation of watching him walk out; the memory of his face hovering inches above hers, bodies pressed together, heat and breath and touch blurring until the rest of the world vanished. All that remained was the weight of him, the warmth, the impossible intimacy she couldn't make herself forget.

She stopped short and braced herself against the trunk of a large oak, the bark rough beneath her palm.

""What the hell is wrong with me?"" she whispered. ""I'm going to lose my mind at this rate. I'll flunk out of school and end up painting houses with Johnny's dad.""

She slowed her breathing, forced herself to look up—and realized she'd walked two blocks past the Whitney Humanities Center. Her watch read one minute, thirty seconds until class.

Never late, she thought numbly. Not until him.

She broke into a jog. The heels she'd worn to impress Johnny—rather than her usual flats—made the situation worse. Of course. Perfect timing for Murphy's Law. She'd tell Professor Roberts her mother had called. That excuse should work.

When she reached the classroom, Professor Roberts was already lecturing, pointing to notes on the whiteboard. Michele drew a steadying breath, gripped the doorknob, and slipped inside.

""Well, that's a surprise,"" he said mildly. ""You're usually the first to arrive, Ms. Weinstein. Everything all right?""

""Yes, Professor. All's well. My mother called. I was just outside the building but had to take it.""

""Well, mothers always come first,"" he said. ""You haven't missed much. Take your seat.""

""Thank you,"" she said, sliding into her usual spot near the front, slightly to his right.

He stood at the lectern, jacket off, sleeves rolled, already deep into the weekend's reading, discussing The Forsyte Saga as though everyone had spent the past two days living inside it. He paced slowly, voice calm and assured, dissecting themes—possession, propriety, the quiet violence of wanting what you believe is yours.

Michele sat perfectly still, pen poised above her notebook, the posture of someone always ready with a sharp insight. But the page beneath her hand stayed mostly blank. The words floated past her without landing.

Normally she'd be ten pages ahead, underlining passages, anticipating questions. Being unprepared wasn't just unfamiliar—it was unthinkable. She was the student he turned to when the room went quiet, the one who nudged discussion forward.

Instead, her mind betrayed her. Every mention of desire cracked her focus just enough to let memory rush in—Friday night, losing control, how completely and unexpectedly Johnny had rearranged her inner landscape.

A flicker of panic stirred. If Professor Roberts called on her, she wouldn't have it. Not today.

She shifted, forced herself to listen, catching just enough fragments to stitch together something coherent if she had to. And beneath the anxiety was something worse—and stranger: the realization that, for the first time, something had mattered more than preparation.

That knowledge unsettled her far more than the missed reading.

Luckily, Sofia Peraza—the school recluse with no social life to speak of—commandeered the entire class, debating Professor Roberts with relentless intensity. She challenged motives, disputed interpretations, and interrogated minor points like a constitutional lawyer arguing before the Supreme Court.

To his credit, Professor Roberts indulged her, leaning against the desk, arms folded, engaging as though this were the intellectual duel he'd been waiting for all semester.

Michele watched with quiet gratitude, like a passenger whose delayed flight had just saved her from disaster.

Sofia's hand shot up again before the professor finished responding. Michele half-listened, jotting down strategic notes—names, themes, page numbers—enough to fake fluency if survival instincts demanded it. She had never been so grateful to be invisible, never so relieved by someone else's relentless earnestness.

If guilt had a sound, it would have been the soft scratch of her pen pretending to work.

When the clock finally ran out, Professor Roberts glanced at it in mild surprise.

""We'll continue on Wednesday,"" he said, casting one last look at Sofia, who appeared prepared to carry the discussion into retirement.

Chairs scraped back, notebooks snapped shut, and Michele exhaled for what felt like the first time in an hour. She left the classroom undefeated—still number one, slightly rattled, faintly amused—and silently vowed that next weekend would involve far less distraction and far more reading.

Or at least, she told herself, that's the plan.

Back at the dorm, Katie sat on her bed stirring a small box of raisins into a cup of Dannon vanilla yogurt. She took a bite and looked up.

""So,"" she said lightly, ""how was your day? And more importantly—did you put Johnny in his place?""

""What is this, twenty questions?"" Michele snapped, tossing her backpack onto the bed and collapsing beside it.

""No need to bite my head off,"" Katie said, rolling her chair closer. ""Okay. You're upset. Talk to Mama Katie.""

""What do you think it's about?"" Michele said. ""Him.""

""What did he do now?""

""Nothing,"" Michele said, sitting up. ""That's the problem. He did absolutely nothing.""

""I don't follow.""

""I sat down. I dressed nicer than usual. I was going to be cool. Aloof. Make him feel bad about leaving Saturday morning."" Her voice cracked. ""And the minute he sees me, his face lights up. That face, Katie—it melts me. And I'm sitting there pretending I don't care.""

She stopped, tears spilling suddenly.

""He walks over to my stool and—""

""Michele,"" Katie said softly, taking her hand. ""What happened?""

""He got the publishing deal. Simon & Schuster. They're publishing his stories. They gave him an advance on a novel."" She laughed weakly through tears. ""He was supposed to be pining over me. Instead he's glowing, smiling, those stupid dimples turning me into jelly. It wasn't supposed to go like that.""

Katie squeezed her hand once, firm.

""I'm sorry, Michele—but you're being awful.""

Michele looked up, startled.

""He shares the biggest news of his life with you because you matter to him,"" Katie went on. ""And all you can think about is how it should've been you.""

Michele folded forward, hugging a pillow to her chest.

""You're right,"" she said quietly. ""I lost it. That was selfish. But honestly... I've never been so proud of anyone in my life. It's like my ego's at war with my heart.""

Katie softened.

""You sound like you're in love with him.""

Michele closed her eyes.

""Damn it. I am. Not just in love—over-the-moon, terrifyingly in love.""

Katie climbed onto the bed and wrapped her in a hug, pressing a tissue into her hand.

""Then tell him,"" she said. ""Call him. Right now.""

Michele reached for her phone—then stopped.

""The poem,"" she said suddenly. ""I have to write the poem. The last one was about him. This one... this one will be about us."" She looked up, eyes shining. ""I'll let him read it Wednesday. Our day. Last time it was about him. This time it'll be about us.""

Katie smiled.

""That's my girl.""

Michele opened her notebook to a fresh page and began to write.

The words came fast—raw, honest, unguarded.

For the first time, she wasn't writing to impress.

She was writing to be seen.

Chapter 9

Michele had been counting down to 12:45 Wednesday.

She'd poured everything she had into the poem—every line raw, stripped of pretense. She told Johnny exactly how she felt: how pride and ego had blinded her to what was right in front of her; how proud she was of him, how thrilled she'd been by his success; how his raw talent had always amazed her.

She wrote about his short stories—shadows stretching through alleys, dangerous men, women who could ruin you with a smile—and how they made her pulse quicken. About his passion for the old noir films he reviewed for the Eagle, so contagious she'd started watching them herself on Netflix just to keep up, just to understand the way his mind worked.

She edited the poem four, maybe five times, reading it aloud until every word rang true. When she was finally satisfied, she printed it, folded it carefully, and slipped it into her bag.

In her mind, she could already see him behind the counter—brown eyes lighting up, dimples cutting deep into that smile she couldn't get out of her head.

She paused in front of the bathroom mirror to check her reflection. No overthinking this time. No heels. No calculated seduction. Just a dark green top that skimmed her curves, comfortable jeans, flats instead of heels.

She wasn't trying to impress him.

She was trying to be honest.

She locked the dorm door behind her and walked briskly toward Gus's. The cool autumn air carried the faint scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, sharp enough to wake her up and make her cheeks flush. For the first time in days, she felt light—ready.

The bell chimed as she pushed open the diner door.

She slid onto her usual stool, pulse quickening. Johnny was there immediately, pouring her coffee with that smooth, familiar motion. She smiled, reached into her bag for the poem—

—and froze.

A slim, pretty nineteen-year-old waitress stepped out of the kitchen.

Blonde ponytail. Fresh uniform. Name tag: Holly.

""Johnny,"" she said brightly, ""will you be a darling and help me with my zipper? This dress is new—I haven't broken it in yet.""

""Oh, sure,"" Johnny replied without hesitation.

He turned, reached behind her, and pulled the zipper up to the nape of her neck.

""There you go, Holly.""

""Thanks, sweetheart,"" she said, flashing a grin. ""Gotta get to my station.""

Michele's smile stiffened, then vanished altogether. She watched—imagined, or maybe noticed—Johnny's gaze linger just a second longer than necessary.

""Who was that?"" she asked, her voice tighter than she meant it to be.

""Holly. She's new. Gus hired her yesterday.""

""Yesterday,"" Michele repeated flatly. ""And you're already helping her get dressed. What are you, her valet?""

Johnny shrugged it off, then planted both hands on the counter as if bracing himself.

The air shifted.

""I've been thinking about what you said, Michele,"" he said quietly. ""And maybe you're right. Maybe we really are from different worlds. Your dad's a judge. Mine's a house painter. I'm blue-collar. Always will be. I don't know what I was thinking—that we could ever work.""

He hesitated, then finished softly.

""It just wasn't meant to be.""

The words hit like a slap.

Anger flared—hot, immediate. She wanted to tell him he was full of it, that the blonde waitress had fluttered her lashes and that was all it took. She wanted to say she'd been right all along—that he'd always choose the diner over her.

But nothing came out.

Instead, something inside her cracked—clean and final.

""I'm in a hurry, John,"" she said, her voice suddenly flat. ""I've got work to do. Just put it in a bag. I need to go.""

""Really?"" he asked, disappointed. ""What about your poem? I was looking forward to it.""

""I didn't finish it,"" she lied. ""Needs a full rewrite. It doesn't matter anymore.""

""Okay,"" he said quietly.

He rolled the top of her paper bag closed and slid it across the counter.

She took it without meeting his eyes, turned, and said over her shoulder, ""See ya around.""

""Bye, Michele,"" he replied, just as softly.

She paid Sylvia at the register. The bell rang when she pushed through the door, dull and sharp all at once, the breeze immediately tangling her hair.

Outside, she stopped.

She pulled the poem from her bag and stared at it—the words she'd finally been brave enough to write, the truth she'd trusted him with.

Then she tore it in half.

And in half again.

She dropped the pieces into the trash can on the corner.

It was still the same day.

1r1va2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1r1va2m/why_my_colleague_destroyed_our_frienshsip/,Why my colleague destroyed our frienshsip?,"I'm a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a 50-year-old woman colleague who was four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We were talking, going to lunch together or with other colleagues. She also brought me home-cooked food, because she knew I liked to eat well. Sometimes she would offer me cakes and snacks, a bit like a big sister I found. Sometimes she had childish behaviors with me, for example one day she ran up to me to talk to me, like a child, and then she teased me during a discussion. Whenever a meal was organized at work for a party, she insisted that I attend, because I don't like meetings between colleagues. Then it became colder and more distant. Sometimes she would come and ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to do some shopping. She often offered outings with the children, but I systematically refused, because I didn't want to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management, a kind of harassment that I experienced very badly. For several months, I didn't talk to anyone at work, focusing on my tasks and trying to get through this difficult time. The colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and simply said, ""I have a lot of work to do,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her on the subway, and she came to see me, offering to travel together. She had a behavior that I would describe as flirting (she would get very close to me, stick her chest against my arm, lean very close to talk to me). One day, she even walked into my office to look at something on my screen and stuck very close to me. I didn't know how to react because she's older, and I was quite surprised.

I then found another job in another office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me on my last day and told me that she was inviting him to lunch that day. On D-Day, she invited me and asked me if she had done something wrong, why I didn't talk to her anymore. I explained to him that I had been harassed and that I had been looking for another job, which I had found. She warmly congratulated me, praising the fact that I was ""comfortable in my job,"" ""drole"" etc. She was relieved that my distant attitude did not come from her. She then continued to engage in flirting gestures, such as touching my hand furtially with her index finger while she ate.

I then told him that, since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with children and spouses (perhaps this was a mistake on my part!). Ravie seemed very excited when I contacted her offering her an outing with the children, but I noticed that she did not warn her husband when we met. That's why I then proposed family outings with the spouses. She accepted and organized several outings during the summer, and we met regularly. With our respective spouses. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my kids and didn't warn her, she would point out to me, ""You didn't call me, it's not nice."" Yet she did it on her side, but frankly, I didn't care. She offered small dishes and snacks, prepared pic-nics. He always seemed very motivated. She also began to criticize her husband, saying that he doesn't invest himself, that he just stays drinking coffee at home, that he is old. When I asked her about the context of their meeting, she told me that he was the one who flirted with her and that she was not interested at first, because he was unemployed at the time. Anyway, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series from her and put them on a USB stick, something her husband could have done. When her husband was present, his behavior changed. She became silent, distant, not talking as usual. We felt that she was away from him. On the contrary, he seemed very much in love.

She promised to show me a recipe. I had proposed that she come home with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal in groups. But one day after an outing with her son and my son, without the spouses exceptionally, she said, ""We'll meet at your house for the recipe. Okay, when I got home, I thought we were going to talk over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking by herself, washing dishes, without saying anything. Very weird. Then she says ""the meal is ready, I have to go now"" and then she left without even talking. It was really, in my opinion, a strange scene.

She had planned to travel to Spain with her family and I told her that I knew this country well and that I preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family.

She started by organizing outings with both families herself, booked hotels, offered hikes. Barbecues and home meals. She even wanted our two families to go out with the children, like at the pool, etc. She even wanted to go together to a foreign country, and to a cottage in the mountains. She also offered to organize a women's outing between her and my mother at a spa. Then, after a dozen intense outings and several invitations to dinner at each other's house, she stopped giving news. All of a sudden. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot, etc. One day her husband was supposed to help me set up a piece of furniture, which had been planned for weeks, and on D-Day, he made me look bad. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I came to pick him up by car, he told me in the car during the ride ""if she wants us to part, no problem."" I didn't understand this intervention.

Then, no more news... I wrote to her several times to find out if everything was okay, and she answered me briefly. I then sent my New Year's greetings to her husband, unanswered. She promised to give me contacts from renovation companies, which she never did.

I then confronted her by text message several months later, without news... I asked her why we disappeared and why she didn't give me the promised information about the renovations. She wrote to me that she was on vacation. I wrote to him: ""You two disappeared without giving us the promised contacts, you are profiteers."" Then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then said something like, ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and then concluded, ""This is where our relationship ends.""",0,1770810540.0,NoStupidQuestions,2,0.33,False

Another week another review. This time around it's redux of Earacoustic Audio. The model is Genesis G318s. I had seen post by Earacoustic about it on FB so naturally was interested in reviewing it. My desire got fulfilled when AudioGeek India got review tour unit & I instantly made sure I got my paws on it. This name is based on scenic route in PRC which is renowned for its scenic beauty. This naming is used to describe how it would feel while listening to music. A pleasant old style analogue tuning. Is it the same or not ? Well read on to find out.  

First of all mighty thanks to Sandeep Bhai the Man behind AudioGeek and to Earacoustic Audio for this opportunity. Without their help this review wouldn't be possible. 

I have not been paid or been compensated in any kind or manner to review this product. All opinions and thoughts are mine.

Now that all pleasantries have been exchanged Let's proceed with the meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Retail package is nothing short of amazing. You get outer sleeve with product photo and details. Inner box has IEM shells, nice case, 4.4mm 0.78mm 2 pin cable and ear tips in plastic case. There two types of ear tips here. One is wide bore black color silicone tip and other is spiral ear tips. (if you are old timer in this hobby you would remember these were offered with some IEMs back in the days) 

Shells are made up of metal. The design on them is interesting and looks handmade. Is it so or not have no idea. They feel like jewelry piece and feel premium. Provided cable has cloth sheathing. 4.4mm jack and 0.78 mm 2 pin connectors are made up of metal. Cable separator is also made up of metal. Pre formed ear hooks on the cable look pretty aggressive. 

Provided case is premium. In my opinion one of the best or only one under 200-250 USD IEM carry case period. 

Best part is on outer box they print/engrave buyers name on metal plate that is glued to box. This feels like custom gift or product. This is nice touch by Earacoustic.

Entire packaging & build quality screams premium. 

Overall Build quality 5/5.  

Comfort :

The shells are huge. So fitting is issue and shape feels bit odd in ears. You have to get used to it. Shells are not heavy so weight of them in ear is no issue. Nozzle is bit stubby i.e. Short . So deep insertion is not possible. Nozzles have lip on them so no ear tip slip offs. Shells didn't create any weird pressure or pain in the ear but shell size being huge your mileage might vary.

Provided ear tips are soft and provide great seal. They don't fold and hold earpieces in ears properly. 

Cable is stiff and has its own memory. Its difficult to roadie wrap. Yet it is manageable. Ear hooks are very aggressively molded. They affect the in ear fitting you have to fight with them and shape them.

Overall comfort is good but marred by and made conditional due to the shell size and the cable.

Overall Comfort 4/5   

Configuration :

8.3 mm Dual magnetic circuit & dual cavity Titanium dome. Diamond diaphragm. Impedance is 38 Ohms. Sensitivity 110 dB. Frequency range 20-20 Khz. 0.78mm 2 pin 4.4 mm balanced OFC cable with 48 braided shielding.

This iem is very efficient (110dB ) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, Onix Alpha XI 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze, shanling M1 plus.

I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn't like presentation with bright sources. 

Song Impressions :

To corelate my findings with actual song impressions I have included few song impressions.

Sada kalo Prem

This song has many instruments such as accordion, organ, piano, guitars. All sound excellent and natural. But the real USP is vocals. Both male and female vocals sound great and natural. Female vocals are key point to focus here and this set nails 100%. Female singer sounds amazing and intimate. You just get lost in them. You don't want to stop. The mix is ethereal here. Great reproduction.

When The Levee Breaks by 

Starting drum sequence is rendered beautifully by this set. There are multiple instruments are playing at the same time. Such as drums, guitars, shakers, mouth organ etc. It doesn't get intense and no smearing or congestion is felt. Cymbal crashes are great and sound natural. Vocals sound natural and as they should be. I had blast listening to this song. I couldn't stop myself from air drumming and feet stomping. Great reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack

 This song has sub bass droning in entire song. That is greatly reproduced here. You can hear it and you can feel it. As this set has amazing sub bass. The mid bass thump is satisfactory. Vocals sound natural. Drums, kick drums and guitars all sound great. Specifically the reverberations you feel when the drums are struck and strings are strummed. This song can get intense but no such thing here. The resolving capabilities do justice. This set passes this test with flying colors. Great experience.

Think U the shit by Ice spice

This is for genre check. Drum beats are on point. Ice spice sounds like her with all her peculiarities. Vocals don't get suppressed in the mix. I must have heard this song for like few hundreds of time and it feels great on this set.  Song flows like it was meant for this set. Wide soundstage makes the song feel immersive. For me this was exceptional experience.

I like this set so much that I wanted to put in more song impressions but then this would have turned in to thesis paper and I didn't want to bore everyone so I will stop here.

Final Conclusion :

I have been fan of TFZ and with Earacoustic they have taken that DNA and now refined it. It is evident with each release. First I heard Spa Hiend and then VSA Max and followed by VSA PM. With SPA Hiend and VSA Max I felt the soundstage and treble extension were bit of chink in armor. Now in the Genesis they have addressed both the issues. It has Earcoustics Bass and vocals and now finally treble that can remedy all my issues. This is a perfect evolution for their portfolio. I think this is one of the best single DD set till date from Earcoustics period.

It creates nice atmospheric feel. Sound just envelopes you. Analogue musical nature makes it enjoyable set. This set is for enjoying music in analogue style. This is not for analytical listening. I can't describe with words how much I like this set. I feel like Earacoustic has created set for me. This set paired with warm and neutral sources is heavenly pleasure. It evokes so may emotions while listening, they just envelope you. Instruments come alive. Vocals pluck strings in your heart. It becomes musical odyssey once they are in my ears.

I think I am over selling this set. Yes cause I love it so much so that I bought my own set. Please understand my bias towards single DD sets. This set proves that a well tuned single DD can show its supremacy in tone & timbre. Now fan boying aside yes, this set has its negatives. No set is perfect. It has issues such as shell size, cable microphonics and not being modular and for some the tuning choice etc. We have to accept that no set is perfect. It just depends on you what you can accept and can't. 

Now for whom is this set meant for ? If you love V/U shaped tuning this is for you. Bass lovers if sub bass lovers yay! If mid bass lovers maybe. For treble heads its near territory but again maybe . But both of them will not regret getting it. Neutral lovers this is definitely not for you. This is too colored for you. 

I hope I have created a proper picture of this set. Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now go grab a cup of coffee and Let's get high on safe high i.e. Music.

So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, Onix Alpha XI 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze, shanling M1 plus.

I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn't like presentation with bright sources. 

Song Impressions :

To corelate my findings with actual song impressions I have included few song impressions.

Sada kalo Prem

This song has many instruments such as accordion, organ, piano, guitars. All sound excellent and natural. But the real USP is vocals. Both male and female vocals sound great and natural. Female vocals are key point to focus here and this set nails 100%. Female singer sounds amazing and intimate. You just get lost in them. You don't want to stop. The mix is ethereal here. Great reproduction.

When The Levee Breaks by 

Starting drum sequence is rendered beautifully by this set. There are multiple instruments are playing at the same time. Such as drums, guitars, shakers, mouth organ etc. It doesn't get intense and no smearing or congestion is felt. Cymbal crashes are great and sound natural. Vocals sound natural and as they should be. I had blast listening to this song. I couldn't stop myself from air drumming and feet stomping. Great reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack

 This song has sub bass droning in entire song. That is greatly reproduced here. You can hear it and you can feel it. As this set has amazing sub bass. The mid bass thump is satisfactory. Vocals sound natural. Drums, kick drums and guitars all sound great. Specifically the reverberations you feel when the drums are struck and strings are strummed. This song can get intense but no such thing here. The resolving capabilities do justice. This set passes this test with flying colors. Great experience.

Think U the shit by Ice spice

This is for genre check. Drum beats are on point. Ice spice sounds like her with all her peculiarities. Vocals don't get suppressed in the mix. I must have heard this song for like few hundreds of time and it feels great on this set.  Song flows like it was meant for this set. Wide soundstage makes the song feel immersive. For me this was exceptional experience.

I like this set so much that I wanted to put in more song impressions but then this would have turned in to thesis paper and I didn't want to bore everyone so I will stop here.

Final Conclusion :

I have been fan of TFZ and with Earacoustic they have taken that DNA and now refined it. It is evident with each release. First I heard Spa Hiend and then VSA Max and followed by VSA PM. With SPA Hiend and VSA Max I felt the soundstage and treble extension were bit of chink in armor. Now in the Genesis they have addressed both the issues. It has Earcoustics Bass and vocals and now finally treble that can remedy all my issues. This is a perfect evolution for their portfolio. I think this is one of the best single DD set till date from Earcoustics period.

It creates nice atmospheric feel. Sound just envelopes you. Analogue musical nature makes it enjoyable set. This set is for enjoying music in analogue style. This is not for analytical listening. I can't describe with words how much I like this set. I feel like Earacoustic has created set for me. This set paired with warm and neutral sources is heavenly pleasure. It evokes so may emotions while listening, they just envelope you. Instruments come alive. Vocals pluck strings in your heart. It becomes musical odyssey once they are in my ears.

I think I am over selling this set. Yes cause I love it so much so that I bought my own set. Please understand my bias towards single DD sets. This set proves that a well tuned single DD can show its supremacy in tone & timbre. Now fan boying aside yes, this set has its negatives. No set is perfect. It has issues such as shell size, cable microphonics and not being modular and for some the tuning choice etc. We have to accept that no set is perfect. It just depends on you what you can accept and can't. 

Now for whom is this set meant for ? If you love V/U shaped tuning this is for you. Bass lovers if sub bass lovers yay! If mid bass lovers maybe. For treble heads its near territory but again maybe . But both of them will not regret getting it. Neutral lovers this is definitely not for you. This is too colored for you. 

I hope I have created a proper picture of this set. Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now go grab a cup of coffee and Let's get high on safe high i.e. Music.

1r1v7it,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1r1v7it/im_always_hungry/,I’m always HUNGRY,"I’ve been trying to shed a few pounds as I’ve got some trips coming up and I’ve gained a bit of that happy relationship weight. Just wanna feel confident in outfits and photos! 

I’ve also started a new (and difficult) degree and I’m basically going to school from 9am-4pm for a Holiday Intensive. This means I eat breakfast around 6:45am and lunch around 12pm followed by dinner around 5:30pm

I figured this forced routine was a perfect time to start my weight loss journey and be more mindful of hunger cues and what I’m eating.

Well! On day 1 I had 2 scrambled eggs and some black coffee with one sugar. I was ravenous by 10am, my stomach growling.

I learned from that mistake and decided to have 3 scrambled eggs with cottage cheese, 2 orange slices and another black coffee. I lasted til about 11:30 before I was hungry again?? I thought this would keep me fuller for way longer.

When I’m hungry I struggle to make healthy choices if I don’t have accessible healthy meals to grab. Lunch is fine because I make it at home, but I’m still prone to grab a snack from our school cafe spots. I’m also hungry by dinner and again if there’s isn’t something cooked I snack so much and probably waste all my calories here.

What do you guys eat for to stay full? I don’t have protein powder and don’t want to buy it. ",4,1770810318.0,loseit,9,0.83,False

Another week another review. This time around it's redux of Earacoustic Audio. The model is Genesis G318s. I had seen post by Earacoustic about it on FB so naturally was interested in reviewing it. My desire got fulfilled when AudioGeek India got review tour unit & I instantly made sure I got my paws on it. This name is based on scenic route in PRC which is renowned for its scenic beauty. This naming is used to describe how it would feel while listening to music. A pleasant old style analogue tuning. Is it the same or not ? Well read on to find out.  

First of all mighty thanks to Sandeep Bhai the Man behind AudioGeek and to Earacoustic Audio for this opportunity. Without their help this review wouldn't be possible. 

I have not been paid or been compensated in any kind or manner to review this product. All opinions and thoughts are mine.

Now that all pleasantries have been exchanged Let's proceed with the meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Retail package is nothing short of amazing. You get outer sleeve with product photo and details. Inner box has IEM shells, nice case, 4.4mm 0.78mm 2 pin cable and ear tips in plastic case. There two types of ear tips here. One is wide bore black color silicone tip and other is spiral ear tips. (if you are old timer in this hobby you would remember these were offered with some IEMs back in the days) 

Shells are made up of metal. The design on them is interesting and looks handmade. Is it so or not have no idea. They feel like jewelry piece and feel premium. Provided cable has cloth sheathing. 4.4mm jack and 0.78 mm 2 pin connectors are made up of metal. Cable separator is also made up of metal. Pre formed ear hooks on the cable look pretty aggressive. 

Provided case is premium. In my opinion one of the best or only one under 200-250 USD IEM carry case period. 

Best part is on outer box they print/engrave buyers name on metal plate that is glued to box. This feels like custom gift or product. This is nice touch by Earacoustic.

Entire packaging & build quality screams premium. 

Overall Build quality 5/5.  

Comfort :

The shells are huge. So fitting is issue and shape feels bit odd in ears. You have to get used to it. Shells are not heavy so weight of them in ear is no issue. Nozzle is bit stubby i.e. Short . So deep insertion is not possible. Nozzles have lip on them so no ear tip slip offs. Shells didn't create any weird pressure or pain in the ear but shell size being huge your mileage might vary.

Provided ear tips are soft and provide great seal. They don't fold and hold earpieces in ears properly. 

Cable is stiff and has its own memory. Its difficult to roadie wrap. Yet it is manageable. Ear hooks are very aggressively molded. They affect the in ear fitting you have to fight with them and shape them.

Overall comfort is good but marred by and made conditional due to the shell size and the cable.

Overall Comfort 4/5   

Configuration :

8.3 mm Dual magnetic circuit & dual cavity Titanium dome. Diamond diaphragm. Impedance is 38 Ohms. Sensitivity 110 dB. Frequency range 20-20 Khz. 0.78mm 2 pin 4.4 mm balanced OFC cable with 48 braided shielding. 

Ear Tips : 

I have used stock wide bore tips with for this review.

I came across Cosmix plant protein but I’m confused because there seem to be two similar versions (shared in the link ).

Can someone explain the actual difference between them?

Also, if you’ve tried Cosmix, which flavor did you like the most?

Best part is on outer box they print/engrave buyers name on metal plate that is glued to box. This feels like custom gift or product. This is nice touch by Earacoustic.

Entire packaging & build quality screams premium. 

Overall Build quality 5/5.  

Comfort :

The shells are huge. So fitting is issue and shape feels bit odd in ears. You have to get used to it. Shells are not heavy so weight of them in ear is no issue. Nozzle is bit stubby i.e. Short . So deep insertion is not possible. Nozzles have lip on them so no ear tip slip offs. Shells didn't create any weird pressure or pain in the ear but shell size being huge your mileage might vary.

Provided ear tips are soft and provide great seal. They don't fold and hold earpieces in ears properly. 

Cable is stiff and has its own memory. Its difficult to roadie wrap. Yet it is manageable. Ear hooks are very aggressively molded. They affect the in ear fitting you have to fight with them and shape them.

Overall comfort is good but marred by and made conditional due to the shell size and the cable.

Overall Comfort 4/5

This iem is very efficient (110dB ) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, Onix Alpha XI 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze, shanling M1 plus.

I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn't like presentation with bright sources. 

Song Impressions :

To corelate my findings with actual song impressions I have included few song impressions.

Sada kalo Prem

This song has many instruments such as accordion, organ, piano, guitars. All sound excellent and natural. But the real USP is vocals. Both male and female vocals sound great and natural. Female vocals are key point to focus here and this set nails 100%. Female singer sounds amazing and intimate. You just get lost in them. You don't want to stop. The mix is ethereal here. Great reproduction.

When The Levee Breaks by 

Starting drum sequence is rendered beautifully by this set. There are multiple instruments are playing at the same time. Such as drums, guitars, shakers, mouth organ etc. It doesn't get intense and no smearing or congestion is felt. Cymbal crashes are great and sound natural. Vocals sound natural and as they should be. I had blast listening to this song. I couldn't stop myself from air drumming and feet stomping. Great reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack

 This song has sub bass droning in entire song. That is greatly reproduced here. You can hear it and you can feel it. As this set has amazing sub bass. The mid bass thump is satisfactory. Vocals sound natural. Drums, kick drums and guitars all sound great. Specifically the reverberations you feel when the drums are struck and strings are strummed. This song can get intense but no such thing here. The resolving capabilities do justice. This set passes this test with flying colors. Great experience.

Think U the shit by Ice spice

This is for genre check. Drum beats are on point. Ice spice sounds like her with all her peculiarities. Vocals don't get suppressed in the mix. I must have heard this song for like few hundreds of time and it feels great on this set.  Song flows like it was meant for this set. Wide soundstage makes the song feel immersive. For me this was exceptional experience.

I like this set so much that I wanted to put in more song impressions but then this would have turned in to thesis paper and I didn't want to bore everyone so I will stop here.

Final Conclusion :

I have been fan of TFZ and with Earacoustic they have taken that DNA and now refined it. It is evident with each release. First I heard Spa Hiend and then VSA Max and followed by VSA PM. With SPA Hiend and VSA Max I felt the soundstage and treble extension were bit of chink in armor. Now in the Genesis they have addressed both the issues. It has Earcoustics Bass and vocals and now finally treble that can remedy all my issues. This is a perfect evolution for their portfolio. I think this is one of the best single DD set till date from Earcoustics period.

It creates nice atmospheric feel. Sound just envelopes you. Analogue musical nature makes it enjoyable set. This set is for enjoying music in analogue style. This is not for analytical listening. I can't describe with words how much I like this set. I feel like Earacoustic has created set for me. This set paired with warm and neutral sources is heavenly pleasure. It evokes so may emotions while listening, they just envelope you. Instruments come alive. Vocals pluck strings in your heart. It becomes musical odyssey once they are in my ears.

I think I am over selling this set. Yes cause I love it so much so that I bought my own set. Please understand my bias towards single DD sets. This set proves that a well tuned single DD can show its supremacy in tone & timbre. Now fan boying aside yes, this set has its negatives. No set is perfect. It has issues such as shell size, cable microphonics and not being modular and for some the tuning choice etc. We have to accept that no set is perfect. It just depends on you what you can accept and can't. 

Now for whom is this set meant for ? If you love V/U shaped tuning this is for you. Bass lovers if sub bass lovers yay! If mid bass lovers maybe. For treble heads its near territory but again maybe . But both of them will not regret getting it. Neutral lovers this is definitely not for you. This is too colored for you. 

I hope I have created a proper picture of this set. Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now go grab a cup of coffee and Let's get high on safe high i.e. Music.

Earacoustic Genesis G318s A vinyl analogue experience Hell Yes!

Michele stayed in bed until nearly eleven. She'd woken around ten-thirty, but it was Saturday—no classes, no deadlines breathing down her neck—and there was no rush to face the day.

She was still burning from the night before.

The sex with Johnny had been incredible—hands down the hottest guy she'd ever been with, and easily the best lover. He'd known exactly where to touch her, not just with his hands but with his mouth, slow and sure, like he'd been studying her for months instead of three. She hugged her pillow to her chest, staring at the ceiling as the memories replayed in vivid, delicious slow motion: the way his breath had hitched when she straddled him, the low groan he made when she moved just right, the way he'd held her gaze like nothing else in the world existed.

Then the daydream faded, and reality crept back in—cold and unwelcome.

She was alone.

He'd gotten up at five in the morning. Five. Chosen to go sling hash and pour coffee for strangers instead of staying in bed and picking up right where they'd left off.

She glanced at Katie's empty bed and counted the hours until her roommate returned. For one reckless moment, she imagined jumping in the shower, making herself irresistible, and marching into Gus's just to give Johnny a reminder of what he'd walked away from—what he probably wouldn't get again.

Stop it, she told herself, rolling onto her side.

Friends with benefits. That was all. It actually worked out perfectly. Who needed him hanging around, prattling on about his dull old movies and that stupid alleged book deal he'd probably misunderstood anyway?

Besides, she had writing assignments stacking up. Emily Brontë would be at her desk by now—not lying in bed near noon obsessing over a boy whose father painted houses and who would probably end up doing the same once his noir fantasy blew up in his face.

Okay. Enough.

She was obsessing. He should be the one obsessing over her—not the other way around.

Around twelve-thirty she finally dragged herself out of bed. The shower steamed up the tiny bathroom, fogging the mirror as hot water beat against her shoulders and eased the tension from her muscles. She toweled off, blow-dried her hair until it fell in soft waves, and threw on the first comfortable things she grabbed—gray joggers and an oversized Yale sweatshirt.

She knocked on Carol's door next door. ""Brunch? Dining hall. Onion-cheese omelet, home fries, toast. I need grease and caffeine.""

Carol appeared in sweatpants and a messy bun. ""Sold.""

They crossed campus together, the crisp fall air carrying the scent of wet leaves and distant bonfires. The dining hall buzzed with energy—students in hoodies and pajama pants, trays clattering, bacon and coffee thick in the air. Michele piled her plate high, added extra hash browns, and slid into a window seat across from Carol.

One bite of omelet—cheesy, salty, perfect—and the last of her morning mood lifted.

Katie would be back soon. She'd tell her everything.

And Monday she'd walk into Gus's like nothing had changed.

Usual stool.Usual coffee.Usual corn muffin.

And Johnny would be behind the counter, wishing she'd called.

Let him wish.

—

Michele was sprawled in the armchair later that afternoon, buried in The Forsyte Saga. The assignment was to read through it and begin outlining a paper on plot and structure. She was midway through Soames's latest marital catastrophe when the lock clicked.

She shut the book and set it face-down on her desk. Galsworthy could wait.

Katie burst in with a gym bag slung over her shoulder and an excited grin that lit up the room. She tossed the bag onto her bed, grabbed a bottle of water from the mini-fridge, and spun around.

""I have been waiting all weekend to hear about this,"" she said, twisting off the cap. ""Did it go to plan? Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am?""

Michele leaned back, folding her arms. ""Well... it went good. And it went bad.""

Katie's eyebrows shot up. She dropped into the desk chair and leaned forward. ""Good and bad? Start with the good. Always start with the good.""

Michele paused, then let a slow smile spread. ""The good is... he's the most beautiful man I've ever seen in my life. I mean Michelangelo-statue beautiful. I inspected him like a home inspector—no flaws. None. And you've seen his face. It's like staring at that old movie star my mom's obsessed with. Tyrone Power.""

""Tyrone who?"" Katie laughed. ""Important question—is he big?""

Michele shot her a look, eyes sparkling. ""Would I be talking like this if he wasn't?""

""Ooooooh,"" Katie drawled. ""You landed a stud, Chelly. Total package. So—what did he say when you laid down the law?""

""Laid down the law?"" Michele scoffed. ""What am I, my dad the judge?""

""You said you wanted friends with benefits. Casual. No drama. Remember?""

""I implied it,"" Michele said, a little defensively. ""It felt awkward spelling it out. We went up to my room right after dinner. I didn't want to listen to him ramble about that silly book deal he thinks he's getting.""

Katie took a long drink and waited.

""I poured vodka. Had him add orange juice,"" Michele continued. ""He said something about wanting to get to know each other. Please. I talk to him more than I talk to my mother.""

""So what did you do?"" Katie asked, mock horror widening her eyes.

""I took my clothes off, pushed him onto the bed, and pulled his pants down.""

Katie burst out laughing. ""You are not inhibited.""

""When you know what you want, you go for it."" Michele's voice softened. ""We made love until past midnight. He's insatiable. Every time I thought he was done, he just kept going. We finally passed out exhausted in each other's arms.""

""Michele,"" Katie said, eyes wide, ""that's both the most romantic and the most obscene story I've ever heard. So what's the bad?""

Michele's smile faded. ""The next morning. I wake up around five to noise. He comes out of the bathroom fully dressed, bright-eyed, and tells me he's going to work. Work.""

Katie blinked. ""Isn't that what you wanted? Casual?""

""I wanted casual. I didn't want gone,"" Michele snapped. ""Who does he think he is?""

""Oh my God.""

""Oh my God what?""

""You like him,"" Katie said, grinning. ""All that friends-with-benefits talk—sounds like you're in lo—""

""Don't,"" Michele cut in. ""Do not say it.""

Katie held up her hands. ""Fine. I won't say it. But I'm thinking it.""

""Well, you're wrong,"" Michele said firmly. ""When I fall in love, it'll be with someone educated, ambitious, with a real career ahead of him. Like my parents.""

Katie shook her head. ""That's not how it works. You don't pick who you fall in you-know-what with.""

""That's ridiculous,"" Michele said. ""Johnny's gorgeous. He's incredible in bed. But he's not boyfriend material. At least not my boyfriend.""

""Suit yourself,"" Katie said, smirking. ""Since he's not good enough for you, I guess I'll take a shot at him next week.""

""Don't you dare, Harris.""

""Point made, Weinstein.""

They burst out laughing, the tension dissolving into the familiar rhythm of two years' worth of shared space.

Michele picked up her book again, but her eyes weren't really on the page.

Katie watched her for a moment, then softened. ""You okay?""

""I'm fine,"" Michele said too quickly. ""Totally fine.""

But she wasn't. Not entirely.

And Monday at Gus's was suddenly feeling a lot more complicated than usual.

Chapter 7

Michele pushed open the door of Gus's Diner at her usual time—12:45 sharp—determined to play it perfectly.

She'd rehearsed the whole thing in her head: stroll in like nothing had happened, order the usual black coffee and buttered corn muffin, toss off one cool, offhand comment about Friday—Fun night, right?—then watch Johnny squirm as he realized she'd already moved on. She'd be breezy. Untouchable. The one in control.

He'd spend the rest of his shift wondering why she wasn't begging for round two.

She slid onto her regular stool, chin up, expression carefully neutral. The bell jingled behind her, and the familiar smells hit—fresh coffee, frying bacon, warm toast. For a split second, her stomach flipped despite herself.

Then Johnny came out of the kitchen carrying two plates of eggs and hash, balancing them with easy confidence. He set them down for a regular at the far end of the counter, flashed that big, familiar smile, and turned.

His eyes found her instantly.

And he lit up.

Not a polite nod. Not a cautious hello. He lit up—like seeing her was the best thing that had happened all day.

He walked straight over, still smiling, wiping his hands on the apron tied around his waist.

""Hey,"" he said, warm and a little breathless. ""You're here.""

Michele lifted one eyebrow, channeling every ounce of practiced indifference she had.

""Usual time. Usual stool. You know how it goes.""

Johnny laughed—soft, surprised, genuinely delighted.

""Yeah,"" he said. ""I know how it goes.""

He leaned his elbows on the counter, close enough that she caught the clean scent of soap and the faint trace of coffee. His brown eyes were bright, unguarded, and suddenly all her carefully rehearsed lines felt thin.

""I got it,"" Johnny said, the grin spreading until his dimples showed. ""They're publishing the short-story collection. And they're giving me a seventy-five-thousand-dollar advance for the novel—more than double what I make here in a year.""

Michele blinked. The cool mask cracked—just slightly.

""Wait. What?""

""Simon & Schuster,"" he said, still sounding like he didn't quite believe it himself. ""Murray's friend read the stories, loved them, passed them up the chain. They want the collection out next fall and the novel the year after. I'm still pinching myself.""

He laughed again, running a hand through his hair.

""I mean, I know it's not a Pulitzer or anything, but... it's real. It's happening.""

The diner noise faded to a low hum. Michele stared at him, her plan evaporating mid-thought. She'd come in ready to make him squirm, ready to remind him who held the power.

Instead, he was standing there glowing—proud but not smug—telling her his dream was coming true.

""You... what?"" she said, her voice climbing despite herself. ""You're telling me Simon & Schuster—Simon & Schuster—is publishing those stories you had me read? And they gave you an advance on a novel? Are we in some alternate universe? How does this even happen?""

Johnny reached for the coffee pot and poured her a fresh cup without asking. Then he slid a buttered corn muffin across the counter—still warm, exactly the way she liked it.

""On the house,"" he said. ""Winner's privilege.""

She took a sip, eyes down, trying to regain her footing. Nothing was adding up. She had two years until graduation, then another two for a master's. My God, she thought. He'll be on his third Mickey Spillane knockoff before I even get started.

""Michele,"" Johnny said, a little louder. ""Michele.""

She looked up and locked onto those brown eyes—the same ones that had undone her Friday night. The little revenge fantasy she'd carried in with her dissolved completely.

""I thought you'd be excited,"" he said gently. ""After what happened Friday night—and now this—it feels like a real start. For something between us. Doesn't it?""

Michele swallowed.

""Johnny... I am happy for you,"" she said carefully. ""Friday night was amazing. Like a fantasy. And this—this publishing deal—it's a dream come true for you.""

She paused, then steadied herself.

""But it's Monday. I'm back on my usual stool, eating my muffin, drinking my coffee. This isn't a fantasy anymore. It's real life.""

Johnny straightened and took a small step back. The disappointment showed, but there was no anger in it—there never was with him.

""So,"" he said, changing tack, ""where's the new poem for the News? You know how much I look forward to reading it.""

""The poem?"" Michele shook her head. ""I never wrote it. Forgot all about it.""

""I get it,"" he said easily. ""Probably had other things on your mind.""

""Yeah,"" she said. ""Didn't finish my reading either, now that you mention it.""

She took the last bite of her muffin and washed it down with coffee.

""I've gotta go, Johnny,"" she said, her voice distant now.

""Hope I see you Wednesday,"" he said quietly. ""You could bring it then, if you want.""

""Yeah,"" she replied. ""I'll see you then.""

She slid off the stool and headed for the register.

Johnny was already taking the next order.

Another week another review. This time around it's redux of Earacoustic Audio. The model is Genesis G318s. I had seen post by Earacoustic about it on FB so naturally was interested in reviewing it. My desire got fulfilled when AudioGeek India got review tour unit & I instantly made sure I got my paws on it. This name is based on scenic route in PRC which is renowned for its scenic beauty. This naming is used to describe how it would feel while listening to music. A pleasant old style analogue tuning. Is it the same or not ? Well read on to find out.  

First of all mighty thanks to Sandeep Bhai the Man behind AudioGeek and to Earacoustic Audio for this opportunity. Without their help this review wouldn't be possible. 

I have not been paid or been compensated in any kind or manner to review this product. All opinions and thoughts are mine.

Now that all pleasantries have been exchanged Let's proceed with the meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Retail package is nothing short of amazing. You get outer sleeve with product photo and details. Inner box has IEM shells, nice case, 4.4mm 0.78mm 2 pin cable and ear tips in plastic case. There two types of ear tips here. One is wide bore black color silicone tip and other is spiral ear tips. (if you are old timer in this hobby you would remember these were offered with some IEMs back in the days) 

Shells are made up of metal. The design on them is interesting and looks handmade. Is it so or not have no idea. They feel like jewelry piece and feel premium. Provided cable has cloth sheathing. 4.4mm jack and 0.78 mm 2 pin connectors are made up of metal. Cable separator is also made up of metal. Pre formed ear hooks on the cable look pretty aggressive. 

Provided case is premium. In my opinion one of the best or only one under 200-250 USD IEM carry case period. 

Best part is on outer box they print/engrave buyers name on metal plate that is glued to box. This feels like custom gift or product. This is nice touch by Earacoustic.

Entire packaging & build quality screams premium. 

Overall Build quality 5/5.  

Comfort :

The shells are huge. So fitting is issue and shape feels bit odd in ears. You have to get used to it. Shells are not heavy so weight of them in ear is no issue. Nozzle is bit stubby i.e. Short . So deep insertion is not possible. Nozzles have lip on them so no ear tip slip offs. Shells didn't create any weird pressure or pain in the ear but shell size being huge your mileage might vary.

Provided ear tips are soft and provide great seal. They don't fold and hold earpieces in ears properly. 

Cable is stiff and has its own memory. Its difficult to roadie wrap. Yet it is manageable. Ear hooks are very aggressively molded. They affect the in ear fitting you have to fight with them and shape them.

Overall comfort is good but marred by and made conditional due to the shell size and the cable.

Overall Comfort 4/5   

Configuration :

8.3 mm Dual magnetic circuit & dual cavity Titanium dome. Diamond diaphragm. Impedance is 38 Ohms. Sensitivity 110 dB. Frequency range 20-20 Khz. 0.78mm 2 pin 4.4 mm balanced OFC cable with 48 braided shielding. 

Ear Tips : 

I have used stock wide bore tips with for this review.

This iem is very efficient (110dB ) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, Onix Alpha XI 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze, shanling M1 plus.

I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn't like presentation with bright sources. 

Song Impressions :

To corelate my findings with actual song impressions I have included few song impressions.

Sada kalo Prem

This song has many instruments such as accordion, organ, piano, guitars. All sound excellent and natural. But the real USP is vocals. Both male and female vocals sound great and natural. Female vocals are key point to focus here and this set nails 100%. Female singer sounds amazing and intimate. You just get lost in them. You don't want to stop. The mix is ethereal here. Great reproduction.

When The Levee Breaks by 

Starting drum sequence is rendered beautifully by this set. There are multiple instruments are playing at the same time. Such as drums, guitars, shakers, mouth organ etc. It doesn't get intense and no smearing or congestion is felt. Cymbal crashes are great and sound natural. Vocals sound natural and as they should be. I had blast listening to this song. I couldn't stop myself from air drumming and feet stomping. Great reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack

 This song has sub bass droning in entire song. That is greatly reproduced here. You can hear it and you can feel it. As this set has amazing sub bass. The mid bass thump is satisfactory. Vocals sound natural. Drums, kick drums and guitars all sound great. Specifically the reverberations you feel when the drums are struck and strings are strummed. This song can get intense but no such thing here. The resolving capabilities do justice. This set passes this test with flying colors. Great experience.

Think U the shit by Ice spice

This is for genre check. Drum beats are on point. Ice spice sounds like her with all her peculiarities. Vocals don't get suppressed in the mix. I must have heard this song for like few hundreds of time and it feels great on this set.  Song flows like it was meant for this set. Wide soundstage makes the song feel immersive. For me this was exceptional experience.

I like this set so much that I wanted to put in more song impressions but then this would have turned in to thesis paper and I didn't want to bore everyone so I will stop here.

Final Conclusion :

I have been fan of TFZ and with Earacoustic they have taken that DNA and now refined it. It is evident with each release. First I heard Spa Hiend and then VSA Max and followed by VSA PM. With SPA Hiend and VSA Max I felt the soundstage and treble extension were bit of chink in armor. Now in the Genesis they have addressed both the issues. It has Earcoustics Bass and vocals and now finally treble that can remedy all my issues. This is a perfect evolution for their portfolio. I think this is one of the best single DD set till date from Earcoustics period.

It creates nice atmospheric feel. Sound just envelopes you. Analogue musical nature makes it enjoyable set. This set is for enjoying music in analogue style. This is not for analytical listening. I can't describe with words how much I like this set. I feel like Earacoustic has created set for me. This set paired with warm and neutral sources is heavenly pleasure. It evokes so may emotions while listening, they just envelope you. Instruments come alive. Vocals pluck strings in your heart. It becomes musical odyssey once they are in my ears.

I think I am over selling this set. Yes cause I love it so much so that I bought my own set. Please understand my bias towards single DD sets. This set proves that a well tuned single DD can show its supremacy in tone & timbre. Now fan boying aside yes, this set has its negatives. No set is perfect. It has issues such as shell size, cable microphonics and not being modular and for some the tuning choice etc. We have to accept that no set is perfect. It just depends on you what you can accept and can't. 

Now for whom is this set meant for ? If you love V/U shaped tuning this is for you. Bass lovers if sub bass lovers yay! If mid bass lovers maybe. For treble heads its near territory but again maybe . But both of them will not regret getting it. Neutral lovers this is definitely not for you. This is too colored for you. 

I hope I have created a proper picture of this set. Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now go grab a cup of coffee and Let's get high on safe high i.e. Music.

The context is im just starting a small gig this valentines day by selling box of cookies, my relative have a food hub and a sari-sari store near the school so their primary market are students, btw the school is public college. Im planning to display my products at their store for feb 13-14. My plan is already laid out and calculated, and im preparing my cookie dough to be bake next day and pack. Then suddenly while im working one person said that i should made the cookies small with a consideration that im selling it for the students at public school, they suggest that i should be selling my cookies for 5-10 pesos, this really trigger me because im already using ingredients that are nearly inexpensive to lower the cost of the product while maintaining the quality. The picture below are one of the costing of my cookies. Im selling the box for 180php with 3 variants (matcha, chocolate, red velvet). Btw my cookies weighing around 40g.

  
To those who already have the stable business out of pastries, how do you handle this kind of feedback? I think my cookies are already cheap enough to cater the market im targeting.

I had a second interview for a tech company in London which would be paying me a quarter more than what I was earning at my last place, plus I'd get to keep every penny of my redundancy package if I got a job now. 

The interview went really well (I think) and they seemed impressed with my experience and the answers I gave. 

This job would essentially mean that 'I made it', having worked my butt off for years to get here from nothing. 

That said, they told me during the interview to expect to be updated in 'the next couple of days', though that was 6 days ago (albeit we were had a weekend in that time too). 

I've been hovering around my phone since and making sure I'm out of bed by their office opening times just in case I miss them. I'm even having quicker showers just in case. 

I know it isn't going to make a difference really, and I'll probably be more disappointed if I don't get it as I really want this job, but the waiting driving me crazy.

1r1uug0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1r1uug0/concerned_about_comanagers_line_management/,Concerned about co-manager’s line management.,"I work for a charity and share management responsibilities with my colleague. We get on well and have worked hard to be united in managing our team in what has been a difficult year. We operate in a hybrid working format, between two offices and WFH.

She is more experienced as a manager than I am, but I do think she doesn’t handle certain situations well. She seems quite intolerant of people asking questions and can interpret these as attacks. I don’t know if there is more I don’t see from the passage of time as I am relatively new in post by comparison.

I try to manage people with respect and fairness but I am not afraid to enact remedial or disciplinary action where necessary. However, I find myself having to bite my tongue when it comes to some of my co-manager’s ways of speaking to people, to avoid creating a disunited front. The team aren’t always blameless and they can play up. But I feel that a better balance can be struck than we have right now.

However, one of my direct reports came to me in confidence and reported that she observed that my fellow co-manager is being considerably stricter with people she is line managing. When her direct reports have their Microsoft Teams noted down as ‘Away’ for any length of time, she is contacting them to ask them to ensure they are online on Teams. I feel this is too much and doesn’t instil trust in the team.

For me, if my direct reports are turning in the work I expect, I don’t have a problem. I will only become stricter if I feel that someone is trying to be fly and cut corners. But I know that sometimes people might have a productive hour and a half and then step away from their desk to get a coffee for 5 minutes or simply have a breather for 10 minutes because our work is stressful. I don’t mind that because I know they work hard and I want them to feel comfortable in work.

How should I broach this subject with her without breaking confidence of person who told me and without seeking to undermine good working relationship? My concern is that this restrictive approach may drive good and experienced team members out of the organisation.",2,1770809119.0,WorkAdvice,0,1.0,False

Recently purchased a Pico for my Mini. I've noticed that my standard espresso grind size is around 20 to get a consistent shot, using various beans. It's intersting because everyone else i know with it, and see online, use around 7-15 for espresso. 

  
I thought perhaps this is because i calibrated the grinder prior to using it, vs just using it out of the box. I see after reading the manual it doesn't require calibration, but have needed to calibrate other grinders in the past i've bought so went ahead and followed the calibration tutorial online.

Coffee is great just was wondering if anyone had experience with this and having the grinder require being on a relatively ""coarser"" setting for espressos.

Cheers!

I'm 21 year old straight black male. This is probably the weirdest way to do this and you’re 100 percent allowed to clown me for it, but I figured I’d ask anyway.

Would anyone be interested in going out on Valentine’s Day with me Like just a normal date, nothing intense. Dinner, coffee, dessert, a movie, walking around a campus, whatever. I’ve honestly never had a Valentine before and I don’t really want to spend that day pretending I don’t care when I actually do.

If you’re also single and you’d rather not rot in your room that night, maybe we can make it a fun low pressure thing. We can chat a bit first and make sure we’re both comfortable. If we don’t vibe, no hard feelings at all.

If you’re down, comment or DM me and tell me your age and what kind of date you’d actually enjoy. And if you’re not down, at least keep the jokes creative.",3,1770808367.0,HoustonSocials,0,0.81,False

Benny's question raced in my mind as I sat there catching my breath from the shock of bearing witness to such a fright filled scene. My eyes still caught on the burn mark in front of me. There was a black substance on my hands and smeared on my clothes, like wet ash or soot. I went to wipe what was on my hands to my shirt, the movement felt recently familiar. Another flash from last night came about. 

I'm in a bathroom, there's writing on the wall made from different pens or markers. I recognize some of them, especially the one I wrote saying 'Keep On Shaking'. I was in the men's room of the Silly Goose, wiping my hand on my pants after getting what was leftover on my face from puking. I must of went there after Hole. Then I'm leaving annoyed from the butchering of my favorite song from the woman on the karaoke stage, running directly into Benny out front. I tell him about what I saw outside of Hole up on the wall. He knew about it. Tells me he was rounding the corner looking for me, witnessed myself desperating trying to get back into the club and whatever the thing was attack the barking dog that was chained up. He hauled it away back onto the rooftops, crawling on the brick and cement walls like a spider. He then went on about how we needed to get off the streets and I was welcome to accompany him back to his place, his car being nearby. Then the rest is bits of both us shuffling through the busy weekend crowds gallivanting and making merry, myself trying to keep up to Benny in my disorientation as he led us to the parking garage where his car laid in wait. 

We got to our destination safely. The place was dimly lit. Most of the lights were out or barely gave off any illumination, while some flickered after seconds of stillness. This garage wasn't the best on the upkeep. Defiantly a muggers choice of place to hide out and wait for unsuspecting victims. We got to his car on the third floor after a short elevator ride. As we arrived, Benny going to insert his key into the car door lock, a flash of something came from the shadows as he was shoved forward to the wall by someone dressed in dark clothes, like the person I saw on the wall. It was him! Benny tried with all his might to keep the person back, pinned against the hard surface as the attacker brought their face closer to his. My view shifted from left to right, I go to pick up something from the ground. A piece of brick it looks like. I look back to the attack on Benny, the dark clothed person looks like he's mauling into his neck. Benny screams as I line drive the half brick landing at the back of the attackers head. Benny shoves back and the attacker stumbles out to the driveway of the lot. I take off in the opposite direction to the stairs as Benny hurrys into his vehicle, I keep my gaze back as I witness Benny turn on his car, quickly back up, hit the attacker with the metal of his cars trunk, slams the gas squealing tires and taking the loop to the garage exit. I stand there at the entrance of the stairway to see if the figure gets up, and he does. The memory fades from my mental grip as I go down the stairs. 

 I focus back to the body outline. The sun beams warmness at the back of my head despite the fact I felt colder than any winter. I stood up, just glaring at the aftermath. I looked back to the window. I needed to check out his phone. Carefully, I got myself back in to Benny's apartment B&E style. Not getting in through the front door. He sealed up all eight dozen of the locks he had installed. The bathroom was a wreck due to our rough housing. The bedroom was a mess surely made by Bennard himself. I made my way past the kitchen to the living room as I searched for a cellular phone anywhere. I found it on the shag rug beneath the coffee table with the pentagram of pure snow still looming. It wasn't a touch screen, so thankfully no passwords. I went through his texts, nothing there, then for some odd reason, I decided to scroll down his photos as I lounged on his couch. The most recent one was of us clanking shot glasses. Someone who must have been around us took it. It wasn't from a selfie angle. There some people in the background, playing pool, others drinking, then there's a couple in the corner at a table. The girl is wearing a red dress and some black, fuzzy drape coat. She's sitting face to the camera with a giant mirror behind her. I can't see the face of the man she is with, just the back of his slick hairdo. I think to myself that I know that outfit. Was it from the first flashback? 

I sat there stewing it over in my thoughts. Closing my eyes tight, I concentrate hard to see the first flash from this morning. The alley I'm looking down is so dark but I see the movements faintly. I see the sparkles of red from her dress. The guy she was with in the bar has her. The slick back hair being a dead giveaway. He looks up to me catching him in the act as I'm being yelled for from someone in my group. Just for a split second, I see his mouth is drenched in blood as I turn my face. Then their both gone as I veer back. I look over the photo. The video quality isn't great at all. Damn throw away phones. From the angle, it looks like the photo was taken from behind the bar. I look at the time seeing it's only a few minutes past two in the afternoon. Jolly's won't be open until six. I had a few hours to spare until I can go interrogate a bartender or two and see who took the photo. I didn't know what to do. I wasn't sure what was going on. I don't think I can go to the police about this. How Benny just died seems impossible. He just combusted into flames and ash in broad daylight after going completely feral on me. His teeth, they turned sharp and jagged like a freakish shark man. His eyes were so hollow and glassy. I don't think that was Benny anymore when he looked up at me. I can still feel the malevolence vibe off him, like I was face to face with a tiger in the wild jungle. 

There was one thing that came to mind of possibly what I was dealing with. The thought of it sent a blizzard down my spine. But, they're not real. Are they? Shaken to my core, I left Benny's and made my way home to change my clothes. The entire walk back was agonizing on my bummed up leg. I passed by Huang's place. Still closed up. I could really use that drink right about now. Nothing today makes any sense. I have to make some sense of it. Instead of heading home, I head to the Annex Apartments a few blocks over. Huang had mentioned once he lived there, but I had no idea which building he lived in let alone which apartment. I had to know he was alright. Sure Benny was a drug dealer, I didn't purchase any from him, but he was my pool buddy. Huang may just be a shopkeeper, but we always have the most mundane yet therapeutic conversations. They may be just people that I see on a regular basis to the eyes of some, but they are my friends damnit. One just burnt to a crisp in front of me and the other is missing. I needed to make sense of it all. 

""This isn't real. This isn't really happening. Huang is good. He's fine."", I caught myself talking out loud. A sort of mantra I had to conjure up to ease my nervousness. The Annex Apartments where made of three buildings mirroring in design. They were built as a kind of project housing for immigrants and locals on fixed incomes. The one building is treated like an old folks home. The other two were known for housing people from all over Asia, the Middle East, India, Africa and so forth. I asked around until I found a nice elderly Chinese lady who said she was his neighbor. 

""I heard awful sounds coming from there last night I think. Maybe it was their TV."", she said to me. ""They always noisy neighbors."" 

Each building had eight floors and twenty apartments on each floor. She directed me to the third one, furthest away from the bench we sat at. I made my way to the forth floor in search of 345A. I kept repeating my new mantra in the elevator as dull music played overhead. I still felt cold but I was sweating all over as I strolled down the hallway nursing my leg with a limp. Huang's door soon came into view after a minute. I knocked over and over and kept knocking until someone would answer, but the call would not be answered. I gave up and tried the knob. It was unlocked. 

Cautiously I walk inside, slowly creaking the door open. ""Hello?"", I greeted aloud into the apartment, ""Huang! You here! Mrs. Huang?"". The quiet was staggering. I leave the door open as I make my way through the place. No one in the kitchen, the one bedroom, but as I enter the living room, there they are. Both Huang and his wife, dead. Their throats were shredded open. Blood was everywhere, soaked in the floor carpet and splattered over the walls. They look as if their skin had been sunken in, like they were drained of all moisture. Their mummified faces frozen in expressions of pain and absolute terror. I stood there paralyzed as I peered into his wifes dried up, yellowed eyes. I fought the urge to scream but couldn't restrain the tears. My sadness for them took over my fear for a moment. I rushed out of there without a second thought still leaving the front door wide open.",1,1770808131.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1. GTM for 0-1 teams (Drove 2x ARR growth in 2 months at previous company)
2. Product (Launched an Indie product with a good friend of mine - Took care of the tech and product here)
3. Design (Well, I also design, pretty much took ownership everywhere I went, Good design is bare minimum)

I have experience building startups, primarily cause I built 2 of them. Also worked with founding teams of a few well-known startups in their early days.

**What I'm looking for:**

My ideal thesis would be consumer, B2B/B2C SaaS, or hardware teams (I'm an electronics engineer by education, so hardware-software integration problems are right up my alley).

Want to work with formidable teams who need someone to come in and execute.

Me and three others will be heading to Wales this upcoming May for a 9-day cycling trip back to Dover. We’re all avid road cyclists from the Netherlands and will be riding road bikes with 30/32mm tires. Although I would've loved to camp we decided to take hotels and hostels, so we're packing relatively light. We're also mostly be staying on paved surfaces with the occasional light gravel along canals that is doable. We’re mostly focused on riding rather than activities, which means we'll mostly only be stopping for good food, coffee, or great views.  
  
I’ve mapped out a route on Komoot,

and before I overthink it even more, I was hoping to get some local insight. Are there any must-see places, especially beautiful roads, viewpoints, or recommended cafes or bakeries along or near the route that should visit? Any sketchy roads we should definitely be avoiding?  
  
Any info would be hugely appreciated!

1r1ugyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXIndia/comments/1r1ugyj/i_miss_having_a_best_friend/,I miss having a best friend,"Disclaimer: This is me venting and reminiscing. Now that that’s out of the way, what I want to say is: I miss having a best friend.

The cruelty in all this is that I used to have a best friend. So I know what I am missing. 😭

She  and I were always together. So much so that people would mistake us for sisters. We had regular sleepovers, and we created our own little world, writing stories about our futures and how we would always be together, even if we moved out or got married. We shared everything. All my secrets were hers and all of hers were mine.

But like all good things, it didn’t last. It started with her getting a boyfriend and me moving away for uni. She always prioritised him over me when it came to calling or texting. Looking back, I can see that she didn’t do anything wrong, but at the time I felt so much rejection and abandonment. I was so angry, and I took it out on her. That was the start of us drifting apart.

We talked less, we texted less, and when I visited home, we met for just a coffee. Soon, even that stopped.

We would text occasionally here and there, but life went on. She moved to a different state and I moved to a different country, and soon all communication stopped.

Then one day, a mutual friend told me that she had been talking about me and how she missed me. The happiness I felt was so intense that it completely overwhelmed me. In that euphoric state, I immediately reached out to her. We caught up on each other’s lives and what had been happening.

To me, this felt like old times. So after some texting, I asked her if she would be interested in visiting me. We started to make plans and honestly, I was over the moon.

Then, a couple of days later, a friend from our college group reached out to me on Instagram. She was someone I hadn’t kept in touch with. I didn’t even have her phone number. But she told me that my “best friend” had messaged her and was talking badly about me. She shared screenshots of their conversation. To say this broke me is an understatement. I felt like my trust had been shattered, and I was left heartbroken.

Since then, I’ve gotten married and, even though I invited her, she unfortunately couldn’t make it as she was travelling, even though I had sent out save the dates and invitations six months and one month in advance.

I guess I am just sad that now I am happy with my life and the friends I have, but this is one thing that I still feel empty about: having a best friend.

I genuinely wish I could build a relationship like that again, where I can trust so easily and be so free and open. Even though I have that with my husband, having a girl best friend is just an entirely different thing.

Well, that’s the end of my reminiscing. I guess I’m just getting old, and maybe looking back and romanticising the past is just a part of life. 😞",3,1770807853.0,TwoXIndia,1,1.0,False

I’m just wanting to hear other people’s experiences starting dexamfetamine. 

I was diagnosed with ADHD last Thursday and I started medication immediately. I’ve been asked to start with 15mg daily. The instructions are to take 10mg in the morning and 5mg after lunch. The first day I tried that I felt it was too intense in my body. I had moments of calmness, followed by chattiness and a good mood. I felt like I was watching myself talk instead of being “in” the conversation. That night around 7pm I suddenly felt a huge wave of dread, anxiety and depression. I felt my stomach drop and it was a terrible experience. I could not sleep at all that night. I didn’t really feel like “myself”

I did not eat a lot that day, I think I had a banana and a protein shake which was a huge mistake and I also had about 3 cups of coffee which I know now is a big no no and I have since dropped to just one cup in the morning at least half an hour before taking my first dose. 

So I started to split my doses into more tolerable amounts such as: 

2.5mg 7am. 2.5mg 10am, 5mg 12-12:45pm, 2.5mg 3-3:45pm and a final 2.5mg at 4:45-5:30pm to help ease the drop. 

I’ve also made a big effort to eat before every dose, even if it is a small amount. I’m adding protein shakes after eating and trying my best to eat even if food is non desirable. 

I haven’t experienced the “drop” like I did the first time, but I do get noticeable loss of energy, I go almost non verbal for an hour or so, followed by a headache (sometimes it goes away after I remind myself to drink water and take a Panadol) and sometimes I don’t feel like doing anything but I do force myself into a task like playing a video game or doing some cleaning and then I feel a bit better. I went and had a rest in bed after work this afternoon but I felt bad not doing anything so now I’m at my computer desk typing this. 

I find that taking the smaller doses has actually helped a lot during the day. I’m not running away from basic repetitive tasks or finding an excuse to leave the desk or hide in the bathroom, and I feel like I can approach situations and conversations slower. My movements feel more deliberate and slower and my mind can focus on the things that are important rather than jumping from one thought to another rapidly. 

Things seem to change when I take the 5mg after lunch, sometimes I feel a bit trembly with a mild anxiety, but I think that anxiety is just me being hyper aware of the fact that I am on a new medication and that I am constantly self monitoring. 

I really want to avoid the afternoon crash, especially when I come home. Home is my sacred space and I don’t want to associate it with knowing I’m about to come down. 

I guess my questions are: 

1. Is this normal for my first week? And does this sound like signs of my dose being too high or too low? 

2. Has anyone experienced this before and did it go away and how did you manage it? 

3. Are we typically allowed to alter the medication timing without always needing to talk to our prescriber? 

4. Has anyone else found success with only taking small doses at a time until it’s time (or needed) for an adjustment or medication change? 

Sorry for the rant, you can tell I am pretty focused on this right now. I was really excited to finally get support for adhd but I live in fear of the come down :( 

Until I can see my doctor, I would love to hear what everyone thinks and has experienced. ",2,1770807634.0,ausadhd,6,1.0,False

The (first) official product introduction for the **Loava Aglaia III** series.



# Translation: Introduction (see picture hereafter)

**LOAVA (Langfeng)** is a binocular brand aimed at professional users with a history spanning over twenty years. Its sub-brand, the **Aglaia (Guanghui)** series, is positioned as **PRO High-End**.

The first generation of Aglaia was launched ten years ago and was the first domestic high-end binocular with a **true flat-field design**. It was bright, transparent, clear to the edges, and had high sharpness. It received acclaim from binocular enthusiasts and professional users immediately upon release. The subsequent second generation received even more praise.

Now, the long-awaited **Aglaia Generation 3** has been officially launched. In addition to inheriting the advantages of the second generation—such as the true flat-field design, low distortion, high-transparency glass, blackout-free eyepieces, and magnesium alloy body—the third generation features a **field of view increased to a 70-degree ultra-wide angle**. It also boasts higher light transmission, better control of chromatic aberration, and **SMC coatings** that render colors more truly, providing a viewing experience that is suddenly open and refreshing.

Regarding specifications, Aglaia Generation 3 mainly promotes the **8.5x44** and **10.5x44** configurations. Compared to similar products, the magnification is ""one step closer,"" and the aperture is ""a bit larger,"" meaning it can replace 50mm aperture models to a certain extent. There will also be a larger 56mm aperture version in the future.

Aglaia Generation 3 comes equipped with dedicated **horn-shaped shading eyecups** and features a patented **forehead rest** design (sold separately) for more stable viewing. A newly designed ergonomic decompression strap and a multi-functional decompression backpack are also available as options.

Whether in optics or build quality, the Aglaia Generation 3 binoculars have reached the level of **imported high-end binoculars**, yet the price is only one-seventh or one-eighth of theirs. We welcome everyone to use Aglaia Generation 3 binoculars and compare them side-by-side with imported high-end binoculars costing 10,000 to 20,000 RMB!

Most important thing for me right now is to save to travel given my closest and easily most reliable friend lives in the UK so being able to visit every few years is HUGELY important to me and not something I'll part ways with.

  
Current situation: got 85k in Kiwisaver and have been contributing 8% since I left uni and went to full time work at 22. Unsure around lifestyle of rent vs own as I'm concerned about overhead expenses of home ownership and being tied down to one location. I'd also potentially look at a tiny home or converting an old bus with solar panels to keep as many of my expenses down as possible.

Saving 300 a week minimum - at the moment this is going in the travel fund. I've got about 8k in the bank for this saved so far.

Expenses are relatively minimal - I'm still flatting and split rent, power, and internet between 3. The place I live in is owner occupied so I'm fortunate enough to not be as affected by rent increases as others. I plan on staying for as long as I possibly can.

For bills I pay them all with my take home pay, save 300ish/week, then put $300 on the debit card and that is my budget for the week for weekly expenses (groceries, coffee, additional things I need to pick up from Warehouse etc)

My take home pay is 1200/weekly but this is likely to drop soon (work restructuring and reduction in hours)

  
I'm worried that I'm not doing near enough and even with 35 years to go, I'll still be behind when it comes to being able to support myself in my old age. That is if I even get there...hence the attitude of doing the things I enjoy now while I'm young and have the energy.

I am looking at potentially investing some money somewhere else to try and build passive income once I get back from my next trip in July, but am overwhelmed at where/what to start with/how much.

Family support around unexpected expenses is excellent. Its just the way my mother especially was raised and she's doing the same to her kids.

# AND I'LL DIE ON THIS HILL

Perth International Airport 

Perth, Western Australia.

\[**Having flown the thousand miles back to Perth, I have six hours until my flight home. I use this time to meet my final interviewee in a spacious, and mostly empty, airport cafe.** 

**Marcus McDonagh only requested the meet three days before, having learned of my tour from Shane Secombe at Mader. A red haired young man in a slightly outgrown business suit, he arrives breathless but punctual.\]**

Sorry I’m late.

\[**You’re not. Please.\]**

**\[He seats himself and orders a black coffee. After some polite questions about my trip, he reveals his motivation for the interview**\]

I don’t want to take up much of your time, I’m sure someone like you is a busy man, it’s just… I’ve been researching this for months, I can back it up. Everyone got it wrong at Tom Price.

**\[I’m sorry, I don’t know who that is**.\]

It’s the name of a town up in the Pilbara. The highest town in the state. You don’t know the battle?

**\[Over these last two weeks, I’ve discovered that it’s a big country.\]**

It’s the site of one of the last battles the DIDO Armada fought. Some of the Armada, anyway. The government had recovered, the Kiwis came to help, and Canberra was sending ANZAC troops over, pushing up from Perth and down from Broome. *2DIDO* was considered obsolete and was pulled out. *Tucker Box* and *Utility Belt* were at Roy Hill having their engines overhauled, because real fuel was available again. *Robbo’s Rumen* was obviously abandoned the moment that happened.

Nobody thought the Armada was really needed to retake Tom Price from the Chads. It’s not that big a town. To the army, though, having even one truck of the Armada there was like carrying Excalibur into battle. The missing *Victa* had been found, the *Palace*, *Keg* and *Big Red Truck* were heading back to retake Pannawonica, and Tom Price was kind of on the way. Many of the army officers had heard the stories, too, and wanted to see the Armada in action before the war was over. So they got the band back together, and they did what they always did: keep *Big Red Truck* back out of harm’s way, and charge in with the others.

\[**His coffee arrives. Marcus gulps it immediately.\]**

The story that caught on, the story everyone tells, is this: a large horde had gathered in the town. Swarm remnants, far more than expected. 

The fighting was loud, and brutal. We pulled back to regroup, and found that the driver of *Big Red Truck* had lost their nerve at the size of the enemy, abandoned the kids and driven off without them. Five days later they found her dead where she had run out of fuel, imprisoned by another horde. 

That driver was Jessica Shaw. 

\[**He lays a Manila folder on the coffee shop table, and opens it to reveal numerous articles clipped or printed from newspapers.\]**

The media, back from the dead like the Chads, had a field day with it. She had the famous surname. It had a dark mirror image they could hook onto; Spencer’s brave charge versus his daughter’s cowardly retreat.

That is not what happened. I was at that battle.

\[**Which unit were you with?**\]

None of them.

\[**He produces a crude lanyard made of braided strips of animal skin. It is threaded through a faded cardboard circle, on which is painted a lopsided smiley face and the words BRT KIDS.\]**

I sat on a corrugated iron rooftop holding a crying six year old girl, while the woman who was a mother to us all saved our lives. 

\[**The fighting got too close?\]**

No. It took me a long time to dig it up, but I have transcripts and other evidence. We didn’t learn a damn thing. The first chance we got, we went straight back to leaning on technology.

\[**Which-\]**

They weren’t using Eddie and the trackers he trained anymore, they were using computer models. Projections from the data he’d been sending them for years. 

The algorithm didn’t see the second horde.  *Bigger* horde. Hell, it hadn’t calculated the first one either. Tom Price is surrounded by lower lying areas and covered approaches. The crowd must have been just far enough away to miss the recon sweep, and was drawn by the sound of the fighting. 

By the time we even saw the swarm it was almost on top of us. Jess only had minutes to act. If she stayed, we were all dead. If she went in behind the Armada and the army, *they* were all dead. If we fled, she’d run out of fuel and strand us kids in a sea of Chads. So she did the only thing she could. 

I remember stepping onto the roof. There were fifteen of us, aged three to fourteen. I was the oldest, not fully understanding what was happening but backing up Jess: “Listen to her, kids, we’re playing a game”. She put her hand on my cheek for a second, then she vanished into the cab… her eyes were crystal blue.

*Big Red Truck* had always taken care of the Armada’s kids, so it had her fancy piano keyboard and all the sound equipment. The kind of sound equipment you only get when you’re the kids of gifted engineers. With the first notes, the Chads switched their hungry eyes from us to her. As she pulled away, she played the kids club theme song that she wrote for us, toot-toots and slide whistle sound and all. One of the little ones even giggled as she left, her rapt audience stumbling behind her and around the bend.

I kept the kids away from the edge for ages, I didn’t know what else to do. When the army came back out of the town, they hadn’t seen- or, somehow, heard- a thing. I tried to tell them, but it was “just sit over there, kid. We’ll work this out”.

It took days to find her without Eddie. She’d kept to the sealed roads and there were crisscrossed swarm tracks in every direction. The Armada crew spread out everywhere and never stopped looking, though. I was with Reena on a horse when we crested a rise and found her.

*Big Red Truck* sat at the top of the next hill. There were thousands of the dead standing all around it, motionless, as if enthralled by her final concert. Music- Brahms or something- still floated to us from the truck, giving me hope. 

We raced back to the Armada, and it came down on them like a hammer. When *Buckinghuge Palace* pulled alongside, Vic McQuilty jumped the gap and ran inside calling Jess’s name. 

He came out sobbing that she was already dead, but the cab couldn’t muffle his gunshot. She’d played her final performance until dehydration took hold, tied herself to the steering wheel, switched to a recording to keep the Chads there, and waited for the end that wasn’t an end.

\[**He gulps coffee again, then realises he hasn’t added sugar. Crystals scatter on the table as his hands fumble with the sachet.\]**

So everyone thinks Jess Shaw died a coward. I’ve tried telling the truth, but no matter what I do, nobody listens to me. I’ll get twenty likes and a couple of comments, and then it drops off the page like it never happened. It’s not right. She was brave. She faced the Chads, with music even.

\[**Like her mother.\]**

Like… yeah. That’s right, she used to sing to them. That’s poetic or something, you can use that, right? You can tell the world that she saved us.

\[**Like her father.\]**

Absolutely! That’s your angle! It was a tiny pissant battle in the middle of nowhere, but she had the heart of her dad. You tell everyone the truth: that she was just as selfless as the great Spencer Shaw.

# Tips for the Perfect Flower and Cake Combo:

**Personalize it:** Choose flowers that are meaningful to you and your partner. Whether it’s their favorite flower or one that reminds you of a special moment, the thoughtfulness behind the selection will make the gift even more meaningful.

**Match the cake to the personality:** If your partner has a sweet tooth, go for something rich and indulgent, like chocolate cake. For someone who prefers lighter flavors, a fruit or citrus cake might be a better choice. Brands like Bakingo, Theobroma, and IGP have options to suit all preferences.

**Consider the presentation:** Presentation is key! Whether it’s a bouquet elegantly wrapped or a cake beautifully frosted, make sure everything is carefully prepared to make the moment extra special.",2,1770807045.0,u_Common-Camp-3704,1,1.0,False

I will clarify I'm not a bot and this is not a copy pasta. I'm just making this post again cuz I believe in trying again. 

I'm 21 year old straight black male. This is probably the weirdest way to do this and you’re 100 percent allowed to clown me for it, but I figured I’d ask anyway.

Would anyone be interested in going out on Valentine’s Day with me Like just a normal date, nothing intense. Dinner, coffee, dessert, a movie, walking around a campus, whatever. I’ve honestly never had a Valentine before and I don’t really want to spend that day pretending I don’t care when I actually do.

If you’re also single and you’d rather not rot in your room that night, maybe we can make it a fun low pressure thing. We can chat a bit first and make sure we’re both comfortable. If we don’t vibe, no hard feelings at all.

If you’re down, comment or DM me and tell me your age and what kind of date you’d actually enjoy. And if you’re not down, at least keep the jokes creative.",0,1770807034.0,houston,7,0.37,False
