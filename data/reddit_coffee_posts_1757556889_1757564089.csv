```
Behind the villainous reality that separates us  
We crossed the raging oceans together,  
Climbed hundreds of towering mountains,  
Traveled thousands of miles,  
Until we reached the quiet forest.  

There, you became the sun in my sky,  
My remedy for every misery,  
And the last puzzling piece of my jigsaw.  

I love you the way I long to relive every beautiful dream I’ve had.  
You remind me of my favorite morning coffee,  
The scent of delicate flowers in the garden,  
And the dazzling moonlight above.  
What a seamless canvas you've become to my sight!  
You're such a breathtaking masterpiece,  
One who painted passion into my soul.  

Our hearts, flowing to the same cue,  
Created a sea of sensations.  
Every aching moment caused by flying bullets  
Was healed by wildflower bandages.  
Every gap between our heartbeats was filled with love.  
That's how it became a vicious cycle —  
A cycle we became addicted to,  
A cycle we can no longer escape, even through a loophole.  

I created poetry for you then,  
Writing with my pen dipped in the blood flowing through my veins.  
I was moved by your story.  
And it was the kind of movement that didn’t push me away —  
It pulled me closer.  
Close enough to hear music in your heartbeat,  
And close enough to create space for unspoken thoughts.  

Indeed, a love without frontiers, yet separated by distance —  
Not between us, but between the reality and truth that contradict us.  
Cheek by jowl, we hold on to what keeps us  
Alive in the midst of what kills us.  
But where will it lead us?  

We're like birds, but we can't fly —  
Because it sinned us.  

Does it ever feel better?  
Mistake after mistake,  
Just to fulfill a destiny?  
I wanted the ending to be beautiful,  
But I don’t want to see the end.  
How paradoxical it is — to hope for something good when it's over,  
Yet not want it to be over.  

Sure, I'm in love with you.  
And it’s the kind of love that’s been tattooed into my body,  
A kind of love carved into my bones.  

You are my untold story —  
A priceless treasure I hid in a jar,  
A perfect dress I locked in the closet,  
And the tears I covered with a smile.  
You are my untold story.  
The forever great love of my life.  
Our love may not be visible,  
But it's written in the stars.  
```

It depends on how you store them—learn tips to keep beans fresh and flavorful for longer.**

Coffee beans have a surprisingly long shelf life if stored correctly. Freshly roasted beans can stay fresh for up to two weeks. After this period, their flavor starts to degrade. Proper storage can extend this freshness. Air-tight containers and cool, dark places are ideal.

Factors like humidity and light exposure significantly impact the beans’ longevity. Understanding these factors helps maintain the best flavor. Discovering how long [coffee beans](https://gomehedi.com/best-coffee-beans-for-pour-over/) last ensures every cup tastes delicious. In this post, we’ll explore the lifespan of coffee beans and ways to keep them fresh. Get ready to brew the perfect cup every time.

# Coffee Bean Lifespan

How long do coffee beans last? This is a common question for coffee lovers. The lifespan of coffee beans varies based on many factors. Freshness is key for a great cup of coffee. Understanding the lifespan of your beans helps you enjoy the best flavor possible. Let’s explore how long coffee beans last and what affects their longevity.

# Factors Affecting Longevity

Several factors affect the longevity of coffee beans. The main ones include:

* **Storage Conditions:** Coffee beans need a cool, dark, and dry place. Exposure to air, light, heat, and moisture reduces their lifespan.
* **Roast Date:** Freshly roasted beans are at their best within two to four weeks. After this period, they start losing their flavor.
* **Packaging:** Beans in vacuum-sealed bags last longer. Airtight containers also help preserve freshness.
* **Bean Type:** Different types of beans have different lifespans. Arabica beans might last longer than Robusta beans.

Here is a table summarizing the factors and their impact on coffee beans’ longevity:

|Factor|Impact on Longevity|
|:-|:-|
|Storage Conditions|High|
|Roast Date|Medium|
|Packaging|High|
|Bean Type|Low|

# Types Of Coffee Beans

Different types of coffee beans have different characteristics. This affects how long they last. The main types are:

* **Arabica:** These beans are known for their smooth and complex flavor. They are more delicate and can lose freshness faster.
* **Robusta:** Robusta beans have a stronger, more bitter taste. They have a longer shelf life due to their higher caffeine content.
* **Liberica:** These beans are less common. They have a unique flavor and can last longer due to their hardy nature.
* **Excelsa:** Often considered a variant of Liberica, these beans also have a long shelf life. They add depth to coffee blends.

Here is a quick comparison of these beans:

|Type|Flavor|Longevity|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Arabica|Smooth, complex|Medium|
|Robusta|Strong, bitter|High|
|Liberica|Unique|High|
|Excelsa|Deep, rich|High|

Understanding these types helps you choose the right beans for your taste. It also ensures you store them properly for maximum freshness.

# Storage Conditions

Do you wonder how long coffee beans last? The answer depends on how you store them. Proper storage conditions are key to keeping coffee fresh and flavorful. Two main factors affect coffee storage: temperature and humidity. Let’s look at each in detail.

# Temperature Control

Temperature plays a crucial role in keeping coffee beans fresh. High temperatures can cause coffee to lose its flavor quickly. On the other hand, very low temperatures can also affect the beans negatively. For optimal storage, aim for a cool, stable environment.

Here are some tips to maintain the right temperature:

* Store beans in a cool, dark place.
* Avoid storing them near ovens or windows where temperatures can fluctuate.
* Do not store coffee beans in the refrigerator. It may seem like a good idea, but the temperature changes can cause moisture to form, impacting the beans.

If you buy coffee in bulk, consider dividing the beans into smaller portions. Store the portions you will not use immediately in airtight containers at room temperature. This helps to keep the majority of your coffee fresh while you use a smaller amount.

|Storage Place|Temperature Range|
|:-|:-|
|Pantry|15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F)|
|Freezer (for long-term storage)|\-18°C (0°F)|

# Humidity Levels

Humidity is another important factor in coffee storage. Moisture can ruin the quality of coffee beans. High humidity can cause beans to become stale or moldy. Low humidity can dry them out, making the flavor weak.

To maintain proper humidity levels:

* Use airtight containers to keep moisture out.
* Avoid storing beans in the kitchen or bathroom where humidity levels are often higher.
* If you live in a humid area, consider using a dehumidifier in your storage area.

Here’s a quick guide to ideal humidity levels for storing coffee beans:

|Condition|Humidity Level|
|:-|:-|
|Optimal|50% to 60%|
|Too Humid|Above 65%|
|Too Dry|Below 40%|

Maintaining the right humidity levels ensures your coffee beans stay fresh and flavorful longer. Following these tips, you can enjoy the best taste from your coffee.

# Packaging Matters

Coffee lovers often wonder how long their coffee beans will last. The answer depends on how well the beans are stored. **Packaging matters** greatly in preserving the freshness and flavor of coffee beans. Let’s delve into two popular methods of packaging: vacuum-sealed bags and airtight containers.

# Vacuum-sealed Bags

Vacuum-sealed bags are a popular choice for storing coffee beans. These bags remove all the air, which helps keep the beans fresh for a longer time. Here are some reasons why vacuum-sealed bags are effective:

* **Oxygen Removal:** Oxygen is the enemy of fresh coffee. By removing air, vacuum-sealed bags prevent oxidation, which can make beans stale.
* **Moisture Protection:** These bags also keep moisture out. Moisture can spoil coffee beans quickly, leading to mold and off-flavors.
* **Light Barrier:** Many vacuum-sealed bags are opaque, protecting beans from light. Light can degrade the quality of coffee beans over time.

Here’s a quick comparison of how long coffee beans can last in vacuum-sealed bags compared to other storage methods:

|Storage Method|Room Temperature|Refrigerated|Frozen|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Vacuum-Sealed Bags|Up to 6 months|Up to 1 year|Up to 2 years|
|Regular Bags|2-4 weeks|1-2 months|6-12 months|

Vacuum-sealed bags are an excellent choice if you want to keep your coffee beans fresh for an extended period. They are particularly useful for those who buy coffee in bulk.

# Airtight Containers

Airtight containers are another effective way to store coffee beans. These containers create a seal that keeps air and moisture out. Here are some benefits of using airtight containers:

* **Reusable:** Unlike vacuum-sealed bags, airtight containers can be used repeatedly. This makes them a cost-effective option.
* **Easy Access:** Airtight containers are easy to open and close. This makes them convenient for daily use.
* **Durability:** These containers are often made of sturdy materials, such as glass or stainless steel, which can last for years.

Let’s compare the longevity of coffee beans stored in airtight containers to other methods:

|Storage Method|Room Temperature|Refrigerated|Frozen|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Airtight Containers|Up to 3 months|Up to 6 months|Up to 1 year|
|Regular Bags|2-4 weeks|1-2 months|6-12 months|

Airtight containers provide a practical solution for coffee enthusiasts. They offer a balance between convenience and effective storage, making them ideal for everyday use.

# Signs Of Freshness

When thinking about how long coffee beans last, it’s important to consider the signs of freshness. Fresh coffee beans make a big difference in the taste and aroma of your cup. Knowing the signs can help you choose the best beans and enjoy a better coffee experience.

# Aroma And Flavor

The aroma and flavor of coffee are key indicators of freshness. Fresh coffee beans have a strong, pleasant smell that stands out. The smell is usually rich and inviting, hinting at the flavors you’ll taste once brewed. Here are some signs to look for:

* **Strong Aroma:** Fresh beans have a potent, fragrant smell. If the aroma is weak or dull, the beans may be stale.
* **Complex Flavors:** Fresh beans offer a range of flavors. You might notice hints of chocolate, fruit, or nuts. Stale beans tend to taste flat and one-dimensional.
* **Lingering Aftertaste:** Fresh coffee leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Stale coffee often leaves a bitter or unpleasant taste.

To ensure your coffee beans stay fresh, store them in an airtight container away from light, heat, and moisture. A cool, dark place is ideal. Using fresh beans within two weeks of roasting is recommended for the best flavor.

# Visual Inspection

You can also tell a lot about the freshness of coffee beans by looking at them. Fresh beans have certain visual characteristics that set them apart from stale ones. Here are some things to check:

* **Color:** Fresh beans have a vibrant color. Depending on the roast, this can range from light brown to dark brown. Stale beans often look dull and faded.
* **Oily Surface:** Freshly roasted beans may have a slight oily sheen. This is a sign of the oils that contribute to the flavor. Over time, beans lose this oil and look dry.
* **Whole Beans:** Fresh beans are usually whole and intact. Cracked or broken beans can be a sign of age or poor storage.

Examining your beans before you brew can help you spot freshness. Keeping an eye on these visual cues will ensure you always have the best quality beans for your coffee.

# Ground Vs. Whole Beans

Coffee lovers often ask, “How long do coffee beans last?” The answer depends on whether you have ground coffee or whole beans. Ground coffee and whole beans have different shelf lives. Understanding these differences helps ensure you always enjoy a fresh cup of coffee. Let’s explore the shelf life and best storage practices for both.

# Shelf Life Comparison

Ground coffee and whole beans have different shelf lives. Ground coffee tends to lose its freshness faster. This happens because more surface area is exposed to air. Oxygen, moisture, and light can degrade coffee quickly.

Whole beans, on the other hand, stay fresh longer. They have less surface area exposed. This protects the beans from environmental factors. Here’s a quick comparison:

|Type|Pantry Shelf Life|Freezer Shelf Life|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Ground Coffee|1-2 weeks|1 month|
|Whole Beans|1-2 months|3-4 months|

**Ground coffee** should be used within 1-2 weeks if stored in the pantry. In the freezer, it can last up to a month.

**Whole beans** last longer. They stay fresh for 1-2 months in the pantry and up to 3-4 months in the freezer.

# Best Practices For Storage

Proper storage is key to maintaining coffee freshness. Here are some tips:

* **Keep coffee in an airtight container.** This prevents exposure to oxygen.
* **Store in a cool, dark place.** Light and heat can degrade coffee quality.
* **Avoid the fridge.** The fridge can introduce moisture, which harms coffee.
* **Use a vacuum-sealed bag.** This helps remove air, preserving freshness.
* **Buy in small quantities.** This ensures you use coffee before it goes stale.

For whole beans, grind only what you need. This keeps the rest of the beans fresh. For ground coffee, use within two weeks for the best flavor.

Following these storage tips helps you enjoy a fresh, flavorful cup of coffee every time. Remember, the fresher the coffee, the better the taste!

# Freezing Coffee Beans

Coffee lovers often wonder about the best ways to keep their coffee beans fresh. One method that stands out is freezing coffee beans. Freezing can help extend the life of your beans, maintaining their flavor and aroma for longer periods. But how long do coffee beans last when frozen? Let’s explore the process of freezing coffee beans and the best way to thaw them for the freshest cup of coffee.

# How To Freeze

Freezing coffee beans can be a simple process if done correctly. Here are the steps to ensure your beans stay fresh:

* **Use airtight containers**: Store beans in containers that seal tightly to prevent moisture and air from getting in. Vacuum-sealed bags work well.
* **Divide into portions**: Freeze small portions so you only thaw what you need. This prevents repeated freezing and thawing, which can degrade quality.
* **Label and date**: Always label containers with the date of freezing. This helps you keep track of how long the beans have been stored.

Here is a quick reference table for freezing coffee beans:

|Step|Description|
|:-|:-|
|1|Use airtight containers|
|2|Divide into portions|
|3|Label and date|

By following these steps, you can ensure your coffee beans remain fresh and flavorful for up to several months.

# Thawing Process

Thawing your frozen coffee beans correctly is just as important as freezing them. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Remove only what you need**: Take out the portion you plan to use. Keeping the rest frozen helps maintain their quality.
2. **Let them sit at room temperature**: Allow the beans to thaw at room temperature. This usually takes a few hours.
3. **Avoid moisture**: Keep the beans in their airtight container while thawing to prevent moisture from condensing on them.

Thawing coffee beans properly helps preserve their flavor and aroma. Here are a few additional tips:

* **Do not refreeze**: Avoid refreezing thawed beans. This can cause them to lose flavor and become stale.
* **Grind after thawing**: Grind the beans only after they have thawed completely. This ensures the best flavor extraction during brewing.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your coffee beans stay fresh and delicious, even after being frozen.

# Using Expired Beans

Do you have some old coffee beans lying around? Wondering if you can still use them? You might be curious about how long coffee beans last and what happens when they expire. This guide will help you understand the safety and flavor aspects of using expired coffee beans.

# Safety Considerations

Using expired coffee beans can be safe, but there are some important things to consider. Here’s what you need to know:

* **Mold Growth:** If the beans were stored in a humid environment, they might develop mold. Mold can be harmful if ingested. Always check for any visible mold before using old beans.
* **Smell Test:** Smell the beans. If they have a rancid or sour odor, it’s best to throw them away. Fresh coffee beans should have a pleasant, aromatic smell.
* **Storage Conditions:** Beans kept in an airtight container in a cool, dark place last longer than those exposed to air and light. Proper storage can extend the life of your beans.

|Storage Method|Estimated Shelf Life|
|:-|:-|
|Airtight Container|Up to 6 months|
|Original Packaging|Up to 3 months|

To sum up, it’s crucial to check for mold, smell the beans, and consider how they were stored. These steps ensure you avoid health risks associated with expired coffee beans.

# Possible Flavor Changes

Expired coffee beans can significantly affect the flavor of your brew. Here’s what you might notice:

* **Stale Taste:** Old beans often lose their original flavor and taste stale. The rich, bold notes of fresh coffee fade over time.
* **Flat Aroma:** Fresh beans have a strong, inviting aroma. Expired beans lose this aroma, resulting in a less enjoyable coffee experience.
* **Bitter Notes:** Stale beans can develop a bitter taste. This bitterness can overpower the subtle flavors you usually enjoy in coffee.

Consider these flavor changes before using expired beans. If you’re not too picky about your coffee’s taste, you might still find it acceptable. But for the best experience, fresh beans are always preferred.

In summary, old coffee beans can be safe to use, but they will likely result in a less flavorful cup of coffee. Always prioritize freshness to enjoy the full, rich taste of your favorite brew.

# Maximizing Freshness

One of the most common questions among coffee lovers is, “How long do coffee beans last?” The freshness of coffee beans greatly affects the quality of the brew. By maximizing freshness, you can enjoy richer and more flavorful cups of coffee every day.

# Buying In Small Quantities

One way to ensure your coffee beans stay fresh is to **buy them in small quantities**. Purchasing only what you need for a week or two helps prevent the beans from sitting too long and losing their flavor.

Here are some tips to keep in mind:

* Purchase beans in amounts you can consume within 7-14 days.
* Store beans in an airtight container to protect them from air and moisture.
* Keep the container in a cool, dark place to maintain optimal freshness.

Smaller purchases also allow you to experiment with different blends and roasts without committing to a large quantity. This variety can keep your coffee experience exciting and enjoyable.

Additionally, buying in small amounts reduces waste. If you end up with stale beans, you might be less inclined to throw away a small batch compared to a large one.

# Regular Roasting Dates

Another crucial factor in maximizing coffee freshness is paying attention to **roasting dates**. Freshly roasted coffee beans have the best flavor, so it’s important to know when your beans were roasted.

Consider these points:

* Look for the roasting date on the coffee bag before purchasing.
* Avoid buying beans that were roasted more than two weeks ago.
* Opt for local roasters who provide recently roasted beans.

Many specialty coffee shops offer beans that are roasted weekly, ensuring you get the freshest product possible. Regularly checking roasting dates allows you to enjoy your coffee at its peak flavor.

Here’s a quick reference table for coffee freshness:

|Roasting Date|Optimal Freshness|
|:-|:-|
|0-7 days|Excellent|
|7-14 days|Good|
|14-21 days|Fair|
|21+ days|Stale|

By paying attention to roasting dates and buying in small quantities, you can consistently enjoy fresh and delicious coffee. These simple practices make a significant difference in the quality of your daily brew.

I'm not expecting much from this but I'm gonna try it regardless. I'm from Canada (not gonna say the province immediately but I'd be happy to say once I get to know you more). Currently about to start work as a social assistance worker so I'll be learning that soon. In my free time, I like to watch anime and play games mostly. I would watch movies and shows but I don't watch Netflix enough to justify the price, but anime I watch a lot of so I do have a Crunchyroll sub.

* Helldivers 2
* Final Fantasy 14
* Granblue Fantasy ReLink

As for what I look like, I'll happily send a photo once we get to know one another, but I'm white with brown hair and green eyes, 170 cm with a slim but athletic fit, weighing about 130 lbs, in case that all matters at all. I'm not looking to have kids in the future, frankly because I don't trust myself to take care of one and not to mention the state of the economy making it difficult to do so. I don't drink much (usually like one mixed drink every few weekends in my own room tbh), don't smoke at all (cigarettes and weed, don't do either), and I don't vape either. 

Aaaaand I think that's about it. I mentioned liking anime earlier but I kinda watch whatever honestly so long as it fills the time. If any of this interests you, feel free to send a message. Preferably I would like to meet someone around my age, but I'm generally alright with anyone who's 20 - 28, give or take a year or two depending on the type of person you are. Looking forward to hopefully meeting you!",1,1757563081.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I was unfortunately separated from the bux today. Official reason is harassment and retaliation (theres WAY more context il provide dont worry) after an ethics and compliance investigsiton. I was with the company for almost 7 years, coffee master and no write ups on my record for nearly 5 years. 

To preface this: I have always had an issue with being super trusting of my partners, especially those I closed with, as you all know, closing with 2 people tends to bring you together especially after the pumpkin season. One of my baristas (TransFem) and I were good friends and even talked outside of work. Im still unsure of what occurred to cause this, but we had a very big fallout, and stopped talking. I attempted to reach out outside of work and mend things but it did not work to say the least. 

Reguardless I was always very respectful and tried to be profesional in the way I communicated and dealt with her on my shifts. About a month ago, I get a call from Ethics and Compliance stating that I am under investigation and that this partner has reported me for saying inappropriate things on the floor. (The 3 mentioned incidents were during the time we were still close and good friends id say) 

(This is where I messed up and frankly I understand if nothing can be done) being concerned for the comfort of my partner I reached out privately and asked if there was anything I was doing or saying that made her uncomfortable, and what I could do to remedy and make her work environment more enjoyable. Guess she did not like this and called ethics again and they confronted me about retaliation. 

Today I got called being told im being separated from the company and had no way or method to fight or prevent it. I worked a full shift before I got fired which was REALLY shitty but whatever. My manager was completely blindsided, and were unaware this was the outcome. They tried to advocate on my behalf since losing a shift is NOT preferable especially with the conditions the store is in rn. 

Can I even appeal this? This was an, in my opinion, unfaithful report and im not even sure on how to phrase it or fight it. Any recommendations or suggestions from anyone who has been in my position would be fantastic. Thank you to all!",0,1757562831.0,starbucks,4,0.5,False

Isn't just bad tasting, it's a declaration of war on your digestive system.

The McDonald's Side Salad, first off, nobody goes to McDonald's for a salad, the only reason you would ever attempt such a thing at this place is to balance your quarters under with cheese because that's so delicious. Big mistake, the little sad container that holds it that can be described as a lettuce stand, which holds wilted greens, an occasional pale tomato chunk and a cucumber slice that's cut so thin its tranlucent. The whole thing has a distinctive refrigerator weary look, like food on its last day before going to the compost bin. Even drowning it in ranch or whatever else you can won't save the texture of the wilting greens.

Regular McDonald's Coffee is a problem, it shouldn't be described as liquid punishment. First off, it's brewed at such a high temperature, it might as well melt the machinery making it. It taste burnt yet it is watery enough to make you think your drinking hot water with coffee beans in it. I don't know, I never thought turning the feeling of regret into a beverage was something ever accomplished before.

I saw you every day. You'd call me in the early mornings before your shifts, on your way home, on my breaks, just because. The sound of your voice became my favorite soundtrack. And now that you're gone, everything is just...quiet. 

There was no big explosive blowout or even a disagreement. It was just as simple as you not replying one day. And then that one day turned into this.

It's been four months of complete silence from you. I've reached out a handful of times to remind you that I'm still here. Hoping. Of course, it's always ended in disappointment. At this point, I know my number was blocked a long time ago.

And maybe it doesn't matter, because I'm doing fine. Good, even. But I still think of you every day. I wish you'd call.

Did you know...I started making art again because we met? I haven't stopped since. Not even in your absence. 

Life is beautiful and I deserve to be a part of it. In a million different ways, you taught me that. And I see it now. It is beautiful. But without you? It's all in grayscale. It's like... I can see the scenery and the moving pieces, the cars driving down the road , the laughter of friends sitting at the bar together, the way rain falls on my window and trickles down gently as if to say ""the drought is over."" And maybe it is. But without you? I'll always be parched.

You gave color to a world that I believed wasn't worth living in. You taught me to believe that I can- that I'm capable of doing the hard thing, even in the absolute worst of times. 

The first thing I ever wrote about you was a single line: ""Good people still exist."" And you do. Just not with me. And that's the part that'll end me. It's a gushing wound that just won't heal. I feel it every day. Maybe you're not the first thing I think of in the morning anymore. But you're always the last thing on my mind before I go to bed.

I wish you'd come back. I wish for it when I'm driving to work in the morning, when I'm having my afternoon coffee, when I'm laughing with friends, when I'm painting.

Fall was your favorite season. It used to be mine, too. But now all I can think of is you. The autumn leaves remind me of the way I fell in love with you. Slowly at first, and then all at once. Both me and the leaves are damned to fade out and decay.

I used to say: ""I'm never drowning when I'm with you."" But without you? I am. And at this point... I can't think of a better way to go.

You hated that I used to call you my sunshine. Any time I said anything too real, too feeling, too ardently romantic, you'd flinch away. But it's true. You'll always be this warm, fleetingly beautiful light. 

I replay the memory of your voice every night. I can't cope with the fact that I'm starting to forget what it sounds like. 

Two days before you disappeared, you saved the last voice message I ever sent you. I guess you'll never have to know what this feels like.

I guess at least one of us deserves to remember. And I'm glad it's you. I know you'll keep those memories safe.

It is feeling more and more likely, but once we make this accusation there is no coming back.


Fair warning, this may be all over the place. It has been a BAD year and this is just ONE MORE THING, so I am kinda spiraling.

So, my aunts took my grandpa to the ER a few days back because something was wrong with his legs. Next thing we hear: he was about to lose said legs if he hadn't come in. After that abuse allegations come up.

I literally woke up two days ago to be told my grandmother (not by blood, but close enough at this point) tried to kill my grandfather. Mind blown. obviously. Not something i expect ever, let alone before my morning coffee.

So at first I am certain something is getting twisted. My grandpa has been declining from alzheimers. I mean he was supposedly on 'hospice', on his way out the door.

Nope. He has a thyroid condition (practically nothing left of it) and has had to take medicine for it for a long time. 

But about a year ago my grandmother called up his doctor and told them he didn't want to take them anymore. Canceled them. I dont even know how that could happen without some follow up, even with a small town doctor they've known forever.

Then it comes up thay my aunt had been on her about missed doctors appointments for him and hiding his meds in her car and all kinds of insanity that I cant believe. 

Like either she did all this or my aunt is making up horrendous s***. But more and more things are coming up 'weird'. Injuries on his back inconsistent with a fall, her following my aunts around declaring they had to speak to HER first if they wanted to talk to the home health nurses. [we had heard from her son during all this that my aunts were causing issues and cause her health to decline from stress.] 

Then there are her 'strokes' that she had to go to the er for suddenly, only to be back home before my mother can even get there to watch over my grandpa (and we are 10 min away.. or maybe it was when we lived 30 min away. We moved a few months ago. Weird either way)... there are also odd things she has said at times. Then things my aunt has heard, like that she was in touch with an old boyfriend and also that her two previous husbands declined in a similar way before their deaths.

Still i want to believe she is addled or something. That miscommunication is blowinf things out of proportion like a bad game of telephone. She is in her 80s and was taking care of him and so much of what I have been told is third party.

But then she called and said something I have trouble getting around. 

See, my aunt got power of attorney so only his kids have the ability to make choices for him. He is in a hospital, fully confidential so NO ONE should know where he is. My aunt told her that he was going to a VA on the coast after she told everyone she didn't want him back home. (Another shocker tbh, but fine maybe she is tired and it just came across cold.)

So first, there was a weird call to the hospital room. They asked for someone with a name so similar to my grandfather's that it made us all wary. Same first name, surname just a few letters different. But, we said wrong number and alerted the nurses just to be safe.

A little bit later my grandmother calls my mom and says she found my grandfather, because mom and I are usually removed from family drama and have been asking HER for updates. So mom asked ""oh? Where is he?"" [Keep in mind we were literally in his hospital room when she called.]

She said she called the VA and they said he was there.

WTF?

Now, my aunt may have mentioned the VA in a text, after gran said she didn't want him coming home when he recovered, but that was a lie. There was never a plan to take him there. He has never been there. No one there would know his name.

To be clear, she has never seemed THAT out of it. Tired, absolutely, But coherent. Present. 

Now, nothing has been brought to the police yet. My aunt has mentioned tons of info she is compiling, but says she wants more. I do too, but we are not equipped for this. We dont have the funds for a PI... but this accusation will destroy our family. I dont think her son is in on it, if anything is going on, but I would never have imagined her depriving her husband of his meds for a year. He shouldn't have survived this long apparently either, because he needed these pills to live. 

I want to speak with a detective, lay out everything I have heard, have my aunt give the evidence she has gathered, and let them decide how we proceed. But once they start asking questions... that's a divide that doesnt likely heal. 

I need some input on what to do. I dont know who to believe here, as I havent seen any hard evidence. Only hearsay and strange things.

AIO?

By trade I'm a pilot. Many ratings and thousands of hours in dozens of planes. Most recently I was in management and trained pilots. I've recently decided to go back to flying. I also have a white collar professional side-gig that I do. (Not uber eats or uber lol!!!)

I’m a divorced dad with a 12-year-old daughter, and we do the 50/50 custody thing. My ex and I actually get along (I know, shocking), and people compliment us on how drama-free it is.

After the divorce (my idea), I did the whole “personal growth” thing. No baggage, no “crazy ex” stories—just came out the other side in a solid spot.

I’m looking for a relationship where 1+1 = 3. A partnership that’s fun, a little banter, some random adventures, and actual teamwork when it comes to building a great life. I’m easygoing, kind, adaptable, and rely way more on common sense than textbooks (though I did get the degree).

I’ve traveled a lot (military brat perks), five continents and counting. Would love someone who’s adventurous, funny, honest, and can handle both a Bolivian mountain hike at 13,000 feet and a Netflix marathon without complaint.

I’m an extroverted introvert; social, but I also appreciate my recharge time. Not materialistic, but thankfully not broke either. I’ve got my own place, my own car, and a solid job. My dad raised me old school: build a guitar? Done. Fix a car? Done. Random home repair? Done (eventually).

I’m not in a rush, but I’d love to find someone fun, grounded, and ready to build something strong. And yeah, long-distance isn’t my jam; so Texas ladies, you’ve got home-field advantage.

I'm the real deal. I don't have any ""gotchas"" or weird crap where I misrepresent myself and you figure it out later and go ""why did I fall for this!"" So are you ready to have a good relationship that is rarely boring, honest, has good communication, and is laughs?

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

1 onion (quartered)

1 jalapeño

1 yellow bell pepper

1 red bell pepper

1 poblano pepper

Drizzle with oil and put salt and pepper on all sides 

Put in the oven at 450 Fahrenheit for 25 minutes once done first roasting turn everything around at six crushed cloves of garlic and roast for an additional 15 minutes 

Afterwards put aluminum foil over the vegetables and let sit for 30 minutes to cool them off remove the seeds removing the skin is optional depends on preference 

Step 2: Prep the Peppers
Now, in a medium pan over medium-high heat, grab:

2 pasilla peppers

1 mulatto pepper

Remove the stems and seeds put them on a dry pan over medium high heat for 30 seconds on each side so to get nice and fragrant afterwards put them in a pot just enough water to cover them when it starts boiling reduce the low heat and simmer for 10 minutes.

Step 3: Tomato Time!
Stir in:

6 oz of tomato paste

1 can of diced tomatoes 

Now here’s where you make a call:

If you love chunky chili like Sonic, add the whole can and your roasted veggies as-is.

If you want it smoother, toss everything in a blender and blend until silky smooth.

Step 4: 
Heat a deep pot over medium-high heat and add:

2 lbs of ground beef

Cook it until it’s perfectly browned, breaking it up as you go. Then, it’s spice time! Add:

2 teaspoons salt

1 teaspoon black pepper

2 tablespoons cumin

2 tablespoons chili powder

1 teaspoon cinnamon

1 teaspoon brown sugar

1 tablespoon ground coffee

1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

Stir everything together until it’s beautifully combined. Now pour in your blended tomato-veggie mix (or your chunkier mix if you kept it classic).

Step 5: The Slow Simmer
Drop in 2 bay leaves, cover the pot, and let the chili simmer over low heat for 4 hours. Be sure to stir occasionally to keep it from burning.

Step 6: Assemble

1. Steam 2 hot dog buns.

2. Pan-fry or boil your hot dogs. (Sonic prefer boiling—10 minutes does the trick!)

3. Theme to your preference

NeverMore

For as long as Christina Ricci’ a forty five year old green eyed, dark haired girl, Having the attitude to match. Her gothic charm, that was all about her, a charm that set her apart from other girls. But for as long as she could always remember, remember having a fascination for dark mysterious men. Men that would often leave her in the dark a place that was often familiar with her. As the wind blew through her dark hair blowing it in and around her face. While hearing the sounds of the Raven off in the distance beckoning to her saying to her for

“NeverMore”

On this night never shall you find yourself desiring another for NeverMore no other shall know you. With Christina’ Often finding herself just wanting to be alone, finding herself often alone in the dark. Looking for more, more than she would often find in her life. For her fascination for dark mysterious men. Men that would often leave her more times than she cared to admit to leaving her only to wanting more. Desiring More, more than they could offer her, leaving her with a burning desire to find more than they could give her. 

As Christina’ stood there her long dark hair covering over her eyes as the wind blew around her. Bringing with it the sounds of night, the sounds of the Raven’ as it beckoned for Christina’ on that foggy dark night. But as we get to know more of Christina’ never a girl to dress to impress, more than less finding herself in a pair of stone washed cut at the knee jeans and black tee. To match her personality, a girl who felt like she didn’t have to impress anyone. 

Just that if someone wanted her, then it was up to them to impress her, which would often leave her desiring more than they gave her. But as the sounds of the night grew quiet, another sound would then echo through the air. As a Raven then flew by her, crowing to her

“NeverMore”

Looking out into the night looking deep into a fog covered area revealing only shadows. But as Christina’ continued to look into the fog a man from deep within it would emerge, lurking from within its grasps, As he just stood there all dressed up in a long dark tailcoat gothic style cost. With his dark curly hair and goatee. Just standing there looking over to her. Just as the Raven then flew by Christina’ once again saying 

“NeverMore”

Just as the mysterious man then said to Christina’ 

“Why go ahead my dear, and you just say the words. And we shall go from there. Knowing how insane one could be knowing him”

For some words where never meant to be spoken but as we shall later see that some unsuspecting people would say the words 

“ Who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

Just as he then vanished back into the foggy night, leaving Christina’ even more curious more than ever now. A curiosity that would leave her knowing more than she ever desired, Standing there running her fingers through her dark hair, Knowing that she had always been surrounded by Dark mysterious men for their presence alone always brought Christina’ wanting to know more. More than they could ever give her. Always finding herself being drawn closer to them by wanting to be with them.

Always wanting to find the darker side of a person, while at the same time not always understanding them. But always finding herself amongst them loving them even if it left her in the dark. If it was for a night of hard sex, Or just finding herself hanging out with them. Looking for the darker side of them. 

But for her, that fascination would leave her in feeling more than words one can say. Or at least one can try to say, But as the night grew longer, as the fog became more deeper in closing her around in it. Our story begins here, for Legend has it that on that day in 1849’ when after five days that when they first found him. Being the one and only 

Edgar Allan Poe’

It is said that the cause of his death remains unknown, But it is said that on the night of when they first found him. That if one, Or others were to stand at his grave and chant the words 

“Who Killed Edgar Allan Poe’”

That they just might find out! But as Christina’ stood there hearing the sounds of darkness echo all around her, along with the sounds of the Raven’ off in the distance hearing it beckon for her

Seeing as the fog would begin to in close on her, With her now seeing nothing but the dimming of a street light off in the distance. But as she looked closer, The same figure was now standing there up underneath the street light. Standing there with a mysterious draw to him, with Christina’ now finding herself being drawn in by him. 

Standing there as the sounds of a Raven’ Could be heard as it flew by her once again as if it was beckoning for her to come. To be and be with him, as Christina’ just stood there looking at a dark figure wearing a long dark gothic style tailcoat. With other clothing to match, with Christina’ Feeling him beckoning for her to come to him. 

As he just stood there directly in front of her, hearing the sounds of the Raven’ calling out her name. As the darkness grew even more around her, But as quickly as he had come, He was now once more hidden back into the fog from which he had come. As Christina’ now stood there looking at a gravestone. Not just any gravestone, But being that of a one Edgar Allen Poe’

As Christina’ could hear the Raven’ crowing into the nights air. With her just standing there looking out into the forever of the darkness of the night. Up underneath a starless nights sky. But if one was to wish upon a star, it would be for one more night for her. One more night to feel him once more. To feel his hands once again up against her, Showing her the feeling that she had yarned for. As her heart was now pounding for more, knowing that once with him Just wasn’t enough for her.

Standing there trying her best to think back on what happened the last five days. Even contemplating to herself, If she really even cared. For they had made their own choice in doing this. But regardless it was Five days, that she will never forget, 

For they will be NeverMore in this world, for the Raven had came for them he had came for them. Never more to know him, to know of his name. For insane to world he had become to a world in which wanted to know 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe, 

And that just wasn’t good enough for Christina’ as she stood there thinking to herself, Should she say it. Should she say the words, For her fascination with dark mysterious men would definitely end with him. But dam! If He could make her feel that way one more time, Then death! Just Bring your ass on! For Christina’ was ready, ready for whatever happens even if it was for her to be

NeverMore

But a girl could always dream, but not this girl! Hell no! For she wanted more than just dreams of him. She wanted to feel him again even if it was to be

NeverMore

But as she stood there thinking to herself! Should she say?

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe?”

But Christina’ being a dark haired girl, Having that gothic charm about her leaving others wanting to know more about her. But never to please her the way that she wanted them to. But Christina’ Knew that she was going to get what she wanted. With her even knowing what happened five nights ago, though she could have never dreamed of anything of this ever happening to anyone. But hey! They asked for it! And she was a girl with needs! Needs that needed to be filled. By the one who could have her being NeverMore! As the Raven flew by saying 

NeverMore

But for now shall we go back to five nights prior, Five nights ago when it all started. But the story will not be starting at night, but that morning, after waking up from a good night of sex. Sex that Christina’ was looking forward to, But still leaving her not feeling completely satisfied.

As she lay there thinking to herself, Was it good Enough? But as usual! Finding herself waking up to an half empty bed beside her. For her so called lover! If one could even can call him that! But to her, After a good night of fucking for him Just wasn’t enough for her. Guessing that’s why her so called lover! Would always show his ass the door before she could. Always finding them gone by morning gone before waking up, as she lay there looking up to the ceiling saying 

“I swear! Guys these days! Just want to get there dicks wet then split!”

Always just to leave her just to finish the rest of the job herself! it’s like goodbye! Thanks for the fuck! More like a smack on my ass! And a kiss on my cheek! Was there way of Telling me! Hey your ass and the ride was great! But dam! This girl needs more than just a dick and a smack on her ass. 

But hey! If you can find a guy who can say more than a words! And do more than just fuck! It’s like hey! my ass is all they want to talk to! Well next time! My ass is going to be doing a hell of lot more talking! If the sounds of my farts is all that they want hear as they fuck me! Then so be it! 

For if they leave me wanting more! Then I’m just going to blow some wind in there face! And tell them to not let the dam door hit them on their ass on the way out. They can just leave! If they leave me unfinished and not filled! But hey sometimes a touch can go much further them one knows. 

I mean hell! If I could get just one guy wanting to touch more than my ass! As he fucks me! Then leaves knowing that his little cock got all up in me! Dam! What is a girl to do just get a touch nowadays, 

For God knows a girl wants more than just a smack on the ass! But it wouldn’t be God that answered her, But someone much darker. To match her gothic style, Leaving her feeling like a girl that has been fulfilled. And occasional holding would be nice, But I guess that would be asking too much, For in a way Christina’ would always leave herself wishing for more.

But when darkness is all she knows then there just isn’t much room left for love! Only sex! But God knows when she will get fully filled again maybe another week or two. Whenever the need for someone to fuck her again kicks in.

Now finding herself getting out of bed seeing the light of day peering into her room like a perv! It wanted to see more of her standing there with her nude ass and all to see! But with a quick pull of the shade and out you go. 

Walking into the bathroom as Christina’ stood there looking into the mirror, looking at herself, Slowly sliding her hand through her dark hair. Knowing dam well that she could do much better than the guys around her. 

Standing there looking at 45 year old girl, Wondering to herself 45 and only a fuck buddy! Well the fuck buddy needs to fuck a hell of lot better! Because if I’m going to give someone my inside! Then they dam well better feel me up all through the night! But being on her own isn’t so bad. It gives her the freedom to be free, To be her

Deciding to finally to get dressed for the day, a little dark eye liner here and there! slapping on a pair of stone washed cut at the knees jeans. Along with a black shirt to go with it. This gothic girl was ready for whatever the day would bring to her! And bring it would in a way that would leave her Not forgetting anytime soon. Not forgetting about the shoes, A pair a converses, And with that, To venture into whatever finds her. And find her something would, Something that she could have never imagined that would be. But imagined is beyond belief, This was beyond death itself. 

Making her way out the door of her apartment here the usual get the hell out! From her neighbor, I guess she didn’t get her feel either, Not even making it off of her floor. When she then came upon a scene that would forever leave her asking? Is death even dead?

Coming to the end of the hallway seeing a couple of cops standing there, standing there with their dicks in their hands as usual around here. Standing there just outside of jimmy’s apartment. Jimmy’ was someone that she would talk to every now and then, not as friends. But more like a neighbor. 

For Jimmy’ was into some serious, dark shit, Some Very dark shit. That often had Christina’ questioning at times. As she then stopped to ask one of the officers, just long enough for him to quit holding his dick in his hands. If anything had happened but as usual the dicks just didn’t know what ass to look or go up. 

Only knowing the hookers ass around the corner, And not really to her surprise the officer didn’t know dick. As he just told me that the landlord had found jimmy dead. As Christina’ then thought to herself 

“Well no shit! How about you get your dick out of your hands and actually do some detective shit!”

But that was just too much to ask, but apparently someone had Murdered! Jimmy’ sometime in the night, but who? Officer dick sure wasn’t going to find out. Who murdered Jimmy. The only the thing they were finding was their lunch. But as Christina’ then walked by the opened door she could see Jimmy’s body lying there all covered on the floor. With blood all on the floor. But Not being unnerved enough by that, bit what was just above him, written on the wall in blood was the words written 

NeverMore

Just then as a Raven’ flew into an open window landing on it’s bottom frame as it the crowed 

“NeverMore”

Like she said, Jimmy’ was into some serious, dark shit. Walking on past making her way outside, where she would then run into another guy. Someone that Christina’ didn’t mind talking to every now and then, that also lived here.

His name was Johnny’ a dark skinned guy, always in his leather black jacket. Sunny outside or not, he was wearing that jacket. With his eyes and hair to match he was someone that Christina’ would often find herself talking to, in a way often finding herself wanting to get close at times. 

But he already had someone, as Christina’ then thought to her herself, at least Johnny’ knew how to please someone. But as Christina’ then walked up to him asking if he had heard anything of what happened to Jimmy’ With Johnny only giving a snark remark! Saying to her! 

“Look! I don’t know! Johnny was into some shady shit and stuff! More than likely a drug debt!” 

With Christina’ then looking to him saying to him in also in a snarky remark 

“Look. I know! Well sorta knew Jimmy’ much more she should have known about him. And that he wasn’t into drugs Johnny’ he was into some serious dark shit! But not drugs, but you don’t have to be so snarky you know”

With Johnny just looking at her, as he then threw his cigarette onto the ground as he said then said to her

“Look! The other night me and Jimmy and four other people, who I didn’t know who they were, well we went down to the Graveyard the other night. And when you said that Jimmy was into some dark shit you wasn’t kidding. I only went along for the ride! But him and the other ones was there for something else!”

With Christina’ then replying 

“Something else! What do you mean something else!”

As Johnny just stared at her giving her a look of disbelief! Before saying 

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

As Christina’ then looked back at him curious like then saying 

“What! What do you mean? Who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

As Johnny always acting the cool guy just looked to Christina’ saying to her 

“Yeah that! We was at his grave sight with some candles and shit! When they started to try to summon something by chanting!”

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

“I mean, I was only along for the ride you know but who knows!”

But as Christina’ then left Johnny to be! She then just made her way about the day, just wondering to what he had said. But Later that night as the darkness of the night was just beginning to set in. A moonless night at that, But as the darkness would come, so would the sounds of other things that night would follow with it. Followed by the sounds of the Raven’ saying to her

NeverMore 

As Christina’ stood there on the roof looking out into the city landscape, still thinking of what Johnny had said to her. Just as a guy off in the distance was just a shredding away on his guitar. Knowing that darkness was coming for someone that night leaving them to be

NeverMore 

As the Raven flew through the night, But deep down within the city we find a young dark haired guy, named Chang’ wearing jeans and a jacket, just making his way out from a corner coffee shop. Carrying a laptop from which he had been working on his novel, but unfortunately for him, a little chanting her had done just a couple of nights ago. Asking 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe

But as just as Chang’ then turned a corner hearing a voice say to him

“For insane I have became, Insane to a world in which wants to know who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

With Chang’ now turning only to see a dark haired man with a goatee, wearing a gothic style black turn tail coat. Watching him as he then made his way from out of the darkened alley way. Asking Chang’

“So a writer I see you want to be, but how insane can you be! Or how insane do you wish to be”

As Chang’ then said back to him

“Who are you? And why do want to know about me wanting to be a writer?”

As the figure then said to Chang’ 

“Is it not I that you seek? To see how insane I have become to a world that wishes to know”

As Chang’ then replied back saying to him

“What do you mean, is not I that I seek? I seek no one! Now leave me be!”

But as the figure then walked closer to Chang’ saying to him

“Oh but you do, you seek to know how insane I have become! So now I will tell you!”

As Chang’ then said back to him

“Tell me what!”

As the figure then replied back to Chang’ saying 

Who killed Edgar Alan Poe

For dead he did indeed leave Chang’ letting him know on how insane he had become to the world. For Chang’ was now

NeverMore

But as her thoughts would go, so would the night. Leaving someone to be NeverMore! As the morning would come, with Christina’ not really wanting to get up,deciding to lay there in her bed listening whatever was on the television. As her fingers just filled in the rest! 

But as she watched the morning news a segment would then catch her attention, and her attention it did. For they the news crew was at a scene of a murder that had happened last night. But as they were talking to the detective, some words would then suddenly come into view, as the camera would then show the words. For written on the wall in blood behind them were the words 

NeverMore

Quickly getting out of bed and getting herself dressed. Making her way down town, at least trying to make her way downtown without being harassed by a couple of guys wanting to know her ass. But as Christina’ being the girl she was just turned around giving them the bird.

Just as a Raven’ then flew by them crowing to them

NeverMore

But as Christina’ soon found herself on the way scene as Christina’ continued to make her way, to scene of the murder, of person with no head. For it would never be found as they were NeverMore to world around them. As he would find out how insane the one that he summoned had became. As the world would continue to want to know 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe,

As Christina’ stood there looking at the words, just as a Raven’ Then Flew by her landing on a railing, crowing 

“NeverMore”

Standing there now looking at the Raven’ just as it then flew off into the day. Leaving the dead person to be, leaving him to a world that wished to know. But only leaving them to knowing 

NeverMore 

And Leaving Christina’ now with more questions than answers, As Christina’ then made her way back across town looking for Johnny with no luck. 

But as day turned into night! Finding herself standing on top of the roof of her building looking out into the city’s landscape. As the same guy was just a shredding away on his guitar. Thinking to herself there had to be a connection with the murders, But what! Or who? For as the next two nights would come. So would two more murders, Leaving them to be

NeverMore

With the same words written 

“NeverMore!”

But as the dead of night would once again leave, 
Bringing with it a new day! Just not for some! Making her way out of her apartment and into the street. Where she would finally run into Johnny’! Making her way over to him kinda yelling at him asking him.  

“The four other people that was with you and Jimmy’ were they the ones murdered the last four nights”

With Johnny just looking at her giving her his same snarky remark saying to her

“Look! I was only along the ride! Those other five were there for some serious dark shit! But if you are so worried about me turning up murdered! Then you need not worry yourself toots”! 

With Christina’ just standing there shaking her head at Johnny as I said to him

“ Yeah well good luck with that shit Johnny!”

Leaving him to be, now going about her day waiting for the night to come, but darkness was never far away. as Christina’ would wait to see if Johnny was right about that or not. But she just guessed  we shall find out soon enough. And soon enough she would leaving her feeling like no one has ever before.

Now Finding herself once again standing there on the roof thinking to herself! the bride once again to be! Looking out into the endless night. Thinking That there was going to be no honeymoon for her anytime soon! 

Standing there looking out into a city landscape of street lights glaring into the city’s night, Just as she then suddenly heard a sound behind her. Turning to only see an individual wearing a solid black gothic style tailcoat old school style, More like the turn of the century style 

With his face being hidden by the shadows of the night just as a Raven’ then flew by her landing on the ledge beside her crowing

“NeverMore!”

Just as the individual standing there looking at her then said to her

“I have became insane! to a world that wants to know!” More than they should know!”

“But For those who chose not to know, never to suffer would they! But instead! Never to been blessed by knowing me”

“Do you want to know? My love!

As Christina’ then said back to him

“Do I want to know what”?

Laughing as he then walked closer to her revealing more of what she wanted to see! As the shadow of the night slowly left from his face. Revealing everything that she wanted to see! Leaving her wanted to know more! For standing there in front of her was a dark haired man around 40’ with a goatee, wearing a solid long black tail coat. Wearing clothes not of this century 

Leaving Christina’ more enticed than ever, Her eyes and heart were now set into place, with her now wanting more. More than she even dared herself to ask, But resist she could not! For there was just something mesmerizing about him that she wanted more off. A feeling of she needed him, a desire that she just could not hide anymore. Finding herself now wanting to know more of him that night. 

As he then smiled at her saying to her

Are you sure that you don’t want to know?

With her again asking him

“know what?”

Knowing that she very much wanted to know more! To know everything about him! 

As he then laughed at me saying to me 

“To know me! Is to know Death! For I have become insane! But to those wishing to know more! I share not what one seeks! But choose instead to only show what one may desire to know”

And desired to know more Christina’ did! Finding herself now coming closer to him, knowing that something about him was more than she wanted to know. But resist she could not! For his presence alone left her feeling it all up inside of her. 

As he then approached her slowly placing his hand on the side of her head, massaging his fingers slowly through her hair. Christina’ was now fully engaged to wanting to know more! More of his touch! Her need to be filled was here and in a big way! And feel it! She very much was! Feeling his hand upon her, every desire of wanting to know more! Was now wanting more! 

As he then placed both of his hands on her head sliding them slowly through her hair, as Christina’s body was now ready for his touch. A touch that she had been yearning for. To show her what she had been looking for, With him now looking at her as he then said 

“To know more, is to desire what one wants to feel! And if you need is to feel? Then my desire is to know you.”

The desire was here, Christina’ thoughts were here, my body was all his! And all he needed to do was feed my desire. The desire to feel every part of him!

Taking off his coat as he placed it on the ground, as he then looked to her placing his finger up to her lips. before saying to her 

“ I know your desire! Now let me know you! 

Christina’ was there! Her desire was now his to do with as he pleased! As he slowly slid his hand down the side of her face, sliding his fingers over  and under her shirt and across her chest! Christina’ heart was pounding! Her body was there in complete control of his hands. Christina’ could feel the sweat on her, ready for his body to be on her. 

For this girl might not be a bride to be, But for one night, She just may need a priest to exercise what ever he puts into her. For she was going to be screaming to the heavens above that hells fire was now burning inside of her, Feeling the heat from his touch, 

Feeling his lips slowly touching her, Pulling her closer feeling his chest up next to hers, With his hands slowly gliding across her back! She wanted this to last all night. To feel hells fire burn within her! As Her body was pulsating, To his very touch. A touch like no other to her. As he then slowly took off her shirt feeling his fingers slowly sliding across her breast! Feeling his breath as her body! now fully up against her as he then whispering to her ear. 

“Tonight my love I will know you as you desire!”

As the flames would ride higher! So would he! As he then slowly lay me down upon coat, sliding his hands through her hair. As Christina’ body was now on fire from the inside! Feeling the burn of his touch inside of her, slowly sliding his hands across her chest. Feeling and teasing her nipples, the sweat pouring from her. 

As he then Massaged her breasts with his hands, with his tongue dancing and slowly gliding around all around her neck. Up to her Christina’s cheek, As Christina’ lay there with her hands now firmly on him, pulling him tighter up against her. Feeling him rub all up against her, With her hands now slowly sliding down his back onto his ass feeling him. Rub himself all up and down her! Before slowly sliding his hands back across her stomach down to her pants. 

Looking at her as he then unzipped her pants sliding them off of her! As his fingers danced around in her! feeling his hands coming back up through her legs. Teasing her inside, as Christina held on! Feeling his breath on her neck as his fingers danced around in her. 

Before slowly Sliding his hands back  up her legs, slinging up to firmly grabbing a hold of her ass. As his tongue found its way all around her neck. Up and into her mouth, as his fingers danced away inside of her. 

Hell was definitely on fire that night! With his hand now firmly holding her rubbing his body up against her, going in and out her. Feeling every finger as his hand danced around inside of her.

As he then raised back up taking off his shirt and pants Just Before placing his body once again upon her. 

With Christina now feeling his sweat slowly sliding her hands all across his body as he then placed her hands around his back. As Christina gave him a look followed by a grin before moving her hands up behind his head. 

Christina’ could now feel every bit of him going deep inside of her! Her hands now firmly grabbing a hold of his back 

As the Devil was now looking up to Christina Ricci’ saying

“Dam! I would give up hell just to be in her!” 

As there bodies were now becoming one, to the night!  as they then slowly made love on the roof not really caring if anyone was watching. For as the night went on so did he! For Christina’ had never made love to anyone like she did to him that night. 

But as good things come, they also have to go

But just before he would disappear forever into back into the night, he then turned to Christina’ asking her

“Do you want to know?”

With Christina’ now looking at him saying 

“Know what?

With him just looking at her before saying 

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

With Christina’ then asking 

“Who?

As he then just laughed as he said

“I did!

“I killed Edgar Allan Poe”

As he then just looked at her laughing as he then just vanished into the night never to seen again.

As the Raven behind her once again crowed

“NeverMore”

Just before it flew off into the night

While him leaving her knowing that her every desire he did feel that night, leaving Christina’ even more fascinated to find out more about him. Drawing her closer to him. For to know his love, his insanity, to feel him once more! is to know the darkness that he has become!

Leaving her now standing there on the roof thinking to herself what about Johnny? Did he kill Johnny?

But she guessed that she will just have to wait until the morning, But if so, then Johnny would be

NeverMore

Leaving Christina Ricci’ then asking herself? Dose she now want to be 

NeverMore herself

I’m renting a house with an octagon-shaped living room. While there are many strong design decisions that I wouldn’t have agreed to if I had been involved in the planning process, this one is one of them. However, the location is great and within my budget. FYI: There’s a second living room upstairs for primary gathering, but I’d like to transform this octagon space into a cozy and inviting space for winter nights and chatting over coffee. I envision a seamless flow between this room and the kitchen/dining space. I’m also open to making changes in the dining room, too.

NeverMore

For as long as Christina Ricci’ a forty five year old green eyed, dark haired girl, Having the attitude to match. Her gothic charm, that was all about her, a charm that set her apart from other girls. But for as long as she could always remember, remember having a fascination for dark mysterious men. Men that would often leave her in the dark a place that was often familiar with her. As the wind blew through her dark hair blowing it in and around her face. While hearing the sounds of the Raven off in the distance beckoning to her saying to her for

“NeverMore”

On this night never shall you find yourself desiring another for NeverMore no other shall know you. With Christina’ Often finding herself just wanting to be alone, finding herself often alone in the dark. Looking for more, more than she would often find in her life. For her fascination for dark mysterious men. Men that would often leave her more times than she cared to admit to leaving her only to wanting more. Desiring More, more than they could offer her, leaving her with a burning desire to find more than they could give her. 

As Christina’ stood there her long dark hair covering over her eyes as the wind blew around her. Bringing with it the sounds of night, the sounds of the Raven’ as it beckoned for Christina’ on that foggy dark night. But as we get to know more of Christina’ never a girl to dress to impress, more than less finding herself in a pair of stone washed cut at the knee jeans and black tee. To match her personality, a girl who felt like she didn’t have to impress anyone. 

Just that if someone wanted her, then it was up to them to impress her, which would often leave her desiring more than they gave her. But as the sounds of the night grew quiet, another sound would then echo through the air. As a Raven then flew by her, crowing to her

“NeverMore”

Looking out into the night looking deep into a fog covered area revealing only shadows. But as Christina’ continued to look into the fog a man from deep within it would emerge, lurking from within its grasps, As he just stood there all dressed up in a long dark tailcoat gothic style cost. With his dark curly hair and goatee. Just standing there looking over to her. Just as the Raven then flew by Christina’ once again saying 

“NeverMore”

Just as the mysterious man then said to Christina’ 

“Why go ahead my dear, and you just say the words. And we shall go from there. Knowing how insane one could be knowing him”

For some words where never meant to be spoken but as we shall later see that some unsuspecting people would say the words 

“ Who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

Just as he then vanished back into the foggy night, leaving Christina’ even more curious more than ever now. A curiosity that would leave her knowing more than she ever desired, Standing there running her fingers through her dark hair, Knowing that she had always been surrounded by Dark mysterious men for their presence alone always brought Christina’ wanting to know more. More than they could ever give her. Always finding herself being drawn closer to them by wanting to be with them.

Always wanting to find the darker side of a person, while at the same time not always understanding them. But always finding herself amongst them loving them even if it left her in the dark. If it was for a night of hard sex, Or just finding herself hanging out with them. Looking for the darker side of them. 

But for her, that fascination would leave her in feeling more than words one can say. Or at least one can try to say, But as the night grew longer, as the fog became more deeper in closing her around in it. Our story begins here, for Legend has it that on that day in 1849’ when after five days that when they first found him. Being the one and only 

Edgar Allan Poe’

It is said that the cause of his death remains unknown, But it is said that on the night of when they first found him. That if one, Or others were to stand at his grave and chant the words 

“Who Killed Edgar Allan Poe’”

That they just might find out! But as Christina’ stood there hearing the sounds of darkness echo all around her, along with the sounds of the Raven’ off in the distance hearing it beckon for her

Seeing as the fog would begin to in close on her, With her now seeing nothing but the dimming of a street light off in the distance. But as she looked closer, The same figure was now standing there up underneath the street light. Standing there with a mysterious draw to him, with Christina’ now finding herself being drawn in by him. 

Standing there as the sounds of a Raven’ Could be heard as it flew by her once again as if it was beckoning for her to come. To be and be with him, as Christina’ just stood there looking at a dark figure wearing a long dark gothic style tailcoat. With other clothing to match, with Christina’ Feeling him beckoning for her to come to him. 

As he just stood there directly in front of her, hearing the sounds of the Raven’ calling out her name. As the darkness grew even more around her, But as quickly as he had come, He was now once more hidden back into the fog from which he had come. As Christina’ now stood there looking at a gravestone. Not just any gravestone, But being that of a one Edgar Allen Poe’

As Christina’ could hear the Raven’ crowing into the nights air. With her just standing there looking out into the forever of the darkness of the night. Up underneath a starless nights sky. But if one was to wish upon a star, it would be for one more night for her. One more night to feel him once more. To feel his hands once again up against her, Showing her the feeling that she had yarned for. As her heart was now pounding for more, knowing that once with him Just wasn’t enough for her.

Standing there trying her best to think back on what happened the last five days. Even contemplating to herself, If she really even cared. For they had made their own choice in doing this. But regardless it was Five days, that she will never forget, 

For they will be NeverMore in this world, for the Raven had came for them he had came for them. Never more to know him, to know of his name. For insane to world he had become to a world in which wanted to know 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe, 

And that just wasn’t good enough for Christina’ as she stood there thinking to herself, Should she say it. Should she say the words, For her fascination with dark mysterious men would definitely end with him. But dam! If He could make her feel that way one more time, Then death! Just Bring your ass on! For Christina’ was ready, ready for whatever happens even if it was for her to be

NeverMore

But a girl could always dream, but not this girl! Hell no! For she wanted more than just dreams of him. She wanted to feel him again even if it was to be

NeverMore

But as she stood there thinking to herself! Should she say?

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe?”

But Christina’ being a dark haired girl, Having that gothic charm about her leaving others wanting to know more about her. But never to please her the way that she wanted them to. But Christina’ Knew that she was going to get what she wanted. With her even knowing what happened five nights ago, though she could have never dreamed of anything of this ever happening to anyone. But hey! They asked for it! And she was a girl with needs! Needs that needed to be filled. By the one who could have her being NeverMore! As the Raven flew by saying 

NeverMore

But for now shall we go back to five nights prior, Five nights ago when it all started. But the story will not be starting at night, but that morning, after waking up from a good night of sex. Sex that Christina’ was looking forward to, But still leaving her not feeling completely satisfied.

As she lay there thinking to herself, Was it good Enough? But as usual! Finding herself waking up to an half empty bed beside her. For her so called lover! If one could even can call him that! But to her, After a good night of fucking for him Just wasn’t enough for her. Guessing that’s why her so called lover! Would always show his ass the door before she could. Always finding them gone by morning gone before waking up, as she lay there looking up to the ceiling saying 

“I swear! Guys these days! Just want to get there dicks wet then split!”

Always just to leave her just to finish the rest of the job herself! it’s like goodbye! Thanks for the fuck! More like a smack on my ass! And a kiss on my cheek! Was there way of Telling me! Hey your ass and the ride was great! But dam! This girl needs more than just a dick and a smack on her ass. 

But hey! If you can find a guy who can say more than a words! And do more than just fuck! It’s like hey! my ass is all they want to talk to! Well next time! My ass is going to be doing a hell of lot more talking! If the sounds of my farts is all that they want hear as they fuck me! Then so be it! 

For if they leave me wanting more! Then I’m just going to blow some wind in there face! And tell them to not let the dam door hit them on their ass on the way out. They can just leave! If they leave me unfinished and not filled! But hey sometimes a touch can go much further them one knows. 

I mean hell! If I could get just one guy wanting to touch more than my ass! As he fucks me! Then leaves knowing that his little cock got all up in me! Dam! What is a girl to do just get a touch nowadays, 

For God knows a girl wants more than just a smack on the ass! But it wouldn’t be God that answered her, But someone much darker. To match her gothic style, Leaving her feeling like a girl that has been fulfilled. And occasional holding would be nice, But I guess that would be asking too much, For in a way Christina’ would always leave herself wishing for more.

But when darkness is all she knows then there just isn’t much room left for love! Only sex! But God knows when she will get fully filled again maybe another week or two. Whenever the need for someone to fuck her again kicks in.

Now finding herself getting out of bed seeing the light of day peering into her room like a perv! It wanted to see more of her standing there with her nude ass and all to see! But with a quick pull of the shade and out you go. 

Walking into the bathroom as Christina’ stood there looking into the mirror, looking at herself, Slowly sliding her hand through her dark hair. Knowing dam well that she could do much better than the guys around her. 

Standing there looking at 45 year old girl, Wondering to herself 45 and only a fuck buddy! Well the fuck buddy needs to fuck a hell of lot better! Because if I’m going to give someone my inside! Then they dam well better feel me up all through the night! But being on her own isn’t so bad. It gives her the freedom to be free, To be her

Deciding to finally to get dressed for the day, a little dark eye liner here and there! slapping on a pair of stone washed cut at the knees jeans. Along with a black shirt to go with it. This gothic girl was ready for whatever the day would bring to her! And bring it would in a way that would leave her Not forgetting anytime soon. Not forgetting about the shoes, A pair a converses, And with that, To venture into whatever finds her. And find her something would, Something that she could have never imagined that would be. But imagined is beyond belief, This was beyond death itself. 

Making her way out the door of her apartment here the usual get the hell out! From her neighbor, I guess she didn’t get her feel either, Not even making it off of her floor. When she then came upon a scene that would forever leave her asking? Is death even dead?

Coming to the end of the hallway seeing a couple of cops standing there, standing there with their dicks in their hands as usual around here. Standing there just outside of jimmy’s apartment. Jimmy’ was someone that she would talk to every now and then, not as friends. But more like a neighbor. 

For Jimmy’ was into some serious, dark shit, Some Very dark shit. That often had Christina’ questioning at times. As she then stopped to ask one of the officers, just long enough for him to quit holding his dick in his hands. If anything had happened but as usual the dicks just didn’t know what ass to look or go up. 

Only knowing the hookers ass around the corner, And not really to her surprise the officer didn’t know dick. As he just told me that the landlord had found jimmy dead. As Christina’ then thought to herself 

“Well no shit! How about you get your dick out of your hands and actually do some detective shit!”

But that was just too much to ask, but apparently someone had Murdered! Jimmy’ sometime in the night, but who? Officer dick sure wasn’t going to find out. Who murdered Jimmy. The only the thing they were finding was their lunch. But as Christina’ then walked by the opened door she could see Jimmy’s body lying there all covered on the floor. With blood all on the floor. But Not being unnerved enough by that, bit what was just above him, written on the wall in blood was the words written 

NeverMore

Just then as a Raven’ flew into an open window landing on it’s bottom frame as it the crowed 

“NeverMore”

Like she said, Jimmy’ was into some serious, dark shit. Walking on past making her way outside, where she would then run into another guy. Someone that Christina’ didn’t mind talking to every now and then, that also lived here.

His name was Johnny’ a dark skinned guy, always in his leather black jacket. Sunny outside or not, he was wearing that jacket. With his eyes and hair to match he was someone that Christina’ would often find herself talking to, in a way often finding herself wanting to get close at times. 

But he already had someone, as Christina’ then thought to her herself, at least Johnny’ knew how to please someone. But as Christina’ then walked up to him asking if he had heard anything of what happened to Jimmy’ With Johnny only giving a snark remark! Saying to her! 

“Look! I don’t know! Johnny was into some shady shit and stuff! More than likely a drug debt!” 

With Christina’ then looking to him saying to him in also in a snarky remark 

“Look. I know! Well sorta knew Jimmy’ much more she should have known about him. And that he wasn’t into drugs Johnny’ he was into some serious dark shit! But not drugs, but you don’t have to be so snarky you know”

With Johnny just looking at her, as he then threw his cigarette onto the ground as he said then said to her

“Look! The other night me and Jimmy and four other people, who I didn’t know who they were, well we went down to the Graveyard the other night. And when you said that Jimmy was into some dark shit you wasn’t kidding. I only went along for the ride! But him and the other ones was there for something else!”

With Christina’ then replying 

“Something else! What do you mean something else!”

As Johnny just stared at her giving her a look of disbelief! Before saying 

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

As Christina’ then looked back at him curious like then saying 

“What! What do you mean? Who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

As Johnny always acting the cool guy just looked to Christina’ saying to her 

“Yeah that! We was at his grave sight with some candles and shit! When they started to try to summon something by chanting!”

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

“I mean, I was only along for the ride you know but who knows!”

But as Christina’ then left Johnny to be! She then just made her way about the day, just wondering to what he had said. But Later that night as the darkness of the night was just beginning to set in. A moonless night at that, But as the darkness would come, so would the sounds of other things that night would follow with it. Followed by the sounds of the Raven’ saying to her

NeverMore 

As Christina’ stood there on the roof looking out into the city landscape, still thinking of what Johnny had said to her. Just as a guy off in the distance was just a shredding away on his guitar. Knowing that darkness was coming for someone that night leaving them to be

NeverMore 

As the Raven flew through the night, But deep down within the city we find a young dark haired guy, named Chang’ wearing jeans and a jacket, just making his way out from a corner coffee shop. Carrying a laptop from which he had been working on his novel, but unfortunately for him, a little chanting her had done just a couple of nights ago. Asking 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe

But as just as Chang’ then turned a corner hearing a voice say to him

“For insane I have became, Insane to a world in which wants to know who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

With Chang’ now turning only to see a dark haired man with a goatee, wearing a gothic style black turn tail coat. Watching him as he then made his way from out of the darkened alley way. Asking Chang’

“So a writer I see you want to be, but how insane can you be! Or how insane do you wish to be”

As Chang’ then said back to him

“Who are you? And why do want to know about me wanting to be a writer?”

As the figure then said to Chang’ 

“Is it not I that you seek? To see how insane I have become to a world that wishes to know”

As Chang’ then replied back saying to him

“What do you mean, is not I that I seek? I seek no one! Now leave me be!”

But as the figure then walked closer to Chang’ saying to him

“Oh but you do, you seek to know how insane I have become! So now I will tell you!”

As Chang’ then said back to him

“Tell me what!”

As the figure then replied back to Chang’ saying 

Who killed Edgar Alan Poe

For dead he did indeed leave Chang’ letting him know on how insane he had become to the world. For Chang’ was now

NeverMore

But as her thoughts would go, so would the night. Leaving someone to be NeverMore! As the morning would come, with Christina’ not really wanting to get up,deciding to lay there in her bed listening whatever was on the television. As her fingers just filled in the rest! 

But as she watched the morning news a segment would then catch her attention, and her attention it did. For they the news crew was at a scene of a murder that had happened last night. But as they were talking to the detective, some words would then suddenly come into view, as the camera would then show the words. For written on the wall in blood behind them were the words 

NeverMore

Quickly getting out of bed and getting herself dressed. Making her way down town, at least trying to make her way downtown without being harassed by a couple of guys wanting to know her ass. But as Christina’ being the girl she was just turned around giving them the bird.

Just as a Raven’ then flew by them crowing to them

NeverMore

But as Christina’ soon found herself on the way scene as Christina’ continued to make her way, to scene of the murder, of person with no head. For it would never be found as they were NeverMore to world around them. As he would find out how insane the one that he summoned had became. As the world would continue to want to know 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe,

As Christina’ stood there looking at the words, just as a Raven’ Then Flew by her landing on a railing, crowing 

“NeverMore”

Standing there now looking at the Raven’ just as it then flew off into the day. Leaving the dead person to be, leaving him to a world that wished to know. But only leaving them to knowing 

NeverMore 

And Leaving Christina’ now with more questions than answers, As Christina’ then made her way back across town looking for Johnny with no luck. 

But as day turned into night! Finding herself standing on top of the roof of her building looking out into the city’s landscape. As the same guy was just a shredding away on his guitar. Thinking to herself there had to be a connection with the murders, But what! Or who? For as the next two nights would come. So would two more murders, Leaving them to be

NeverMore

With the same words written 

“NeverMore!”

But as the dead of night would once again leave, 
Bringing with it a new day! Just not for some! Making her way out of her apartment and into the street. Where she would finally run into Johnny’! Making her way over to him kinda yelling at him asking him.  

“The four other people that was with you and Jimmy’ were they the ones murdered the last four nights”

With Johnny just looking at her giving her his same snarky remark saying to her

“Look! I was only along the ride! Those other five were there for some serious dark shit! But if you are so worried about me turning up murdered! Then you need not worry yourself toots”! 

With Christina’ just standing there shaking her head at Johnny as I said to him

“ Yeah well good luck with that shit Johnny!”

Leaving him to be, now going about her day waiting for the night to come, but darkness was never far away. as Christina’ would wait to see if Johnny was right about that or not. But she just guessed  we shall find out soon enough. And soon enough she would leaving her feeling like no one has ever before.

Now Finding herself once again standing there on the roof thinking to herself! the bride once again to be! Looking out into the endless night. Thinking That there was going to be no honeymoon for her anytime soon! 

Standing there looking out into a city landscape of street lights glaring into the city’s night, Just as she then suddenly heard a sound behind her. Turning to only see an individual wearing a solid black gothic style tailcoat old school style, More like the turn of the century style 

With his face being hidden by the shadows of the night just as a Raven’ then flew by her landing on the ledge beside her crowing

“NeverMore!”

Just as the individual standing there looking at her then said to her

“I have became insane! to a world that wants to know!” More than they should know!”

“But For those who chose not to know, never to suffer would they! But instead! Never to been blessed by knowing me”

“Do you want to know? My love!

As Christina’ then said back to him

“Do I want to know what”?

Laughing as he then walked closer to her revealing more of what she wanted to see! As the shadow of the night slowly left from his face. Revealing everything that she wanted to see! Leaving her wanted to know more! For standing there in front of her was a dark haired man around 40’ with a goatee, wearing a solid long black tail coat. Wearing clothes not of this century 

Leaving Christina’ more enticed than ever, Her eyes and heart were now set into place, with her now wanting more. More than she even dared herself to ask, But resist she could not! For there was just something mesmerizing about him that she wanted more off. A feeling of she needed him, a desire that she just could not hide anymore. Finding herself now wanting to know more of him that night. 

As he then smiled at her saying to her

Are you sure that you don’t want to know?

With her again asking him

“know what?”

Knowing that she very much wanted to know more! To know everything about him! 

As he then laughed at me saying to me 

“To know me! Is to know Death! For I have become insane! But to those wishing to know more! I share not what one seeks! But choose instead to only show what one may desire to know”

And desired to know more Christina’ did! Finding herself now coming closer to him, knowing that something about him was more than she wanted to know. But resist she could not! For his presence alone left her feeling it all up inside of her. 

As he then approached her slowly placing his hand on the side of her head, massaging his fingers slowly through her hair. Christina’ was now fully engaged to wanting to know more! More of his touch! Her need to be filled was here and in a big way! And feel it! She very much was! Feeling his hand upon her, every desire of wanting to know more! Was now wanting more! 

As he then placed both of his hands on her head sliding them slowly through her hair, as Christina’s body was now ready for his touch. A touch that she had been yearning for. To show her what she had been looking for, With him now looking at her as he then said 

“To know more, is to desire what one wants to feel! And if you need is to feel? Then my desire is to know you.”

The desire was here, Christina’ thoughts were here, my body was all his! And all he needed to do was feed my desire. The desire to feel every part of him!

Taking off his coat as he placed it on the ground, as he then looked to her placing his finger up to her lips. before saying to her 

“ I know your desire! Now let me know you! 

Christina’ was there! Her desire was now his to do with as he pleased! As he slowly slid his hand down the side of her face, sliding his fingers over  and under her shirt and across her chest! Christina’ heart was pounding! Her body was there in complete control of his hands. Christina’ could feel the sweat on her, ready for his body to be on her. 

For this girl might not be a bride to be, But for one night, She just may need a priest to exercise what ever he puts into her. For she was going to be screaming to the heavens above that hells fire was now burning inside of her, Feeling the heat from his touch, 

Feeling his lips slowly touching her, Pulling her closer feeling his chest up next to hers, With his hands slowly gliding across her back! She wanted this to last all night. To feel hells fire burn within her! As Her body was pulsating, To his very touch. A touch like no other to her. As he then slowly took off her shirt feeling his fingers slowly sliding across her breast! Feeling his breath as her body! now fully up against her as he then whispering to her ear. 

“Tonight my love I will know you as you desire!”

As the flames would ride higher! So would he! As he then slowly lay me down upon coat, sliding his hands through her hair. As Christina’ body was now on fire from the inside! Feeling the burn of his touch inside of her, slowly sliding his hands across her chest. Feeling and teasing her nipples, the sweat pouring from her. 

As he then Massaged her breasts with his hands, with his tongue dancing and slowly gliding around all around her neck. Up to her Christina’s cheek, As Christina’ lay there with her hands now firmly on him, pulling him tighter up against her. Feeling him rub all up against her, With her hands now slowly sliding down his back onto his ass feeling him. Rub himself all up and down her! Before slowly sliding his hands back across her stomach down to her pants. 

Looking at her as he then unzipped her pants sliding them off of her! As his fingers danced around in her! feeling his hands coming back up through her legs. Teasing her inside, as Christina held on! Feeling his breath on her neck as his fingers danced around in her. 

Before slowly Sliding his hands back  up her legs, slinging up to firmly grabbing a hold of her ass. As his tongue found its way all around her neck. Up and into her mouth, as his fingers danced away inside of her. 

Hell was definitely on fire that night! With his hand now firmly holding her rubbing his body up against her, going in and out her. Feeling every finger as his hand danced around inside of her.

As he then raised back up taking off his shirt and pants Just Before placing his body once again upon her. 

With Christina now feeling his sweat slowly sliding her hands all across his body as he then placed her hands around his back. As Christina gave him a look followed by a grin before moving her hands up behind his head. 

Christina’ could now feel every bit of him going deep inside of her! Her hands now firmly grabbing a hold of his back 

As the Devil was now looking up to Christina Ricci’ saying

“Dam! I would give up hell just to be in her!” 

As there bodies were now becoming one, to the night!  as they then slowly made love on the roof not really caring if anyone was watching. For as the night went on so did he! For Christina’ had never made love to anyone like she did to him that night. 

But as good things come, they also have to go

But just before he would disappear forever into back into the night, he then turned to Christina’ asking her

“Do you want to know?”

With Christina’ now looking at him saying 

“Know what?

With him just looking at her before saying 

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

With Christina’ then asking 

“Who?

As he then just laughed as he said

“I did!

“I killed Edgar Allan Poe”

As he then just looked at her laughing as he then just vanished into the night never to seen again.

As the Raven behind her once again crowed

“NeverMore”

Just before it flew off into the night

While him leaving her knowing that her every desire he did feel that night, leaving Christina’ even more fascinated to find out more about him. Drawing her closer to him. For to know his love, his insanity, to feel him once more! is to know the darkness that he has become!

Leaving her now standing there on the roof thinking to herself what about Johnny? Did he kill Johnny?

But she guessed that she will just have to wait until the morning, But if so, then Johnny would be

NeverMore

Leaving Christina Ricci’ then asking herself? Dose she now want to be 

NeverMore herself

I’ve been looking at openings for cashier jobs, a coffee shop position, and even babysitting for neighbors.

My uncle owns a small corner store and every summer he expects me to help out. The thing is, when he says help, he doesn’t mean a real job. He doesn’t pay hourly, there’s no schedule, and he calls me whenever he needs someone to stock shelves or clean. Sometimes he’ll hand me twenty bucks at the end of a really long day, but that’s it. Last summer I basically gave up all my weekends for what added up to less than a hundred dollars. So this year I told my Uncle that  I wanted to find an actual job with consistent hours and pay. After i told that to my Uncle, he doesn't seem to understand my decision and still tried to ask me to help, and somehow he told my mom about my decision, and my mom also stand with my uncle.  At the same time I don’t see how that’s gonna help me when I need to save money and plan my own.

And man… Rachel really is such a gem of a character. From spoiled rich girl to coffee shop waitress to fashion exec, her growth is wild. She gets jealous, makes mistakes, cries… but then wipes her tears and keeps going. And through it all, she never loses herself. She's not just about romance, she’s about finding her own way and loving herself.

They hang out in places like Port Baku, wearing fake designer clothes, sipping overpriced coffee, and talking like they own half the city. I’ve seen some of them literally look down on waiters and regular people, like they’re royalty.

One of the most entitled things I’ve seen was a kid bragging about how his dad “pays for the police anyway” so rules don’t apply to him. Another one tried to flex by saying “we never fly economy,” only for his Instagram stories to accidentally show he was very much in economy.

It’s honestly wild how much entitlement comes not from actual success, but from pretending or riding on shady family money.

Behind the villainous reality that separates us  
We crossed the raging oceans together,  
Climbed hundreds of towering mountains,  
Traveled thousands of miles,  
Until we reached the quiet forest.  

There, you became the sun in my sky,  
My remedy for every misery,  
And the last puzzling piece of my jigsaw.  

I love you the way I long to relive every beautiful dream I’ve had.  
You remind me of my favorite morning coffee,  
The scent of delicate flowers in the garden,  
And the dazzling moonlight above.  
What a seamless canvas you've become to my sight!  
You're such a breathtaking masterpiece,  
One who painted passion into my soul.  

Our hearts, flowing to the same cue,  
Created a sea of sensations.  
Every aching moment caused by flying bullets  
Was healed by wildflower bandages.  
Every gap between our heartbeats was filled with love.  
That's how it became a vicious cycle —  
A cycle we became addicted to,  
A cycle we can no longer escape, even through a loophole.  

I created poetry for you then,  
Writing with my pen dipped in the blood flowing through my veins.  
I was moved by your story.  
And it was the kind of movement that didn’t push me away —  
It pulled me closer.  
Close enough to hear music in your heartbeat,  
And close enough to create space for unspoken thoughts.  

Indeed, a love without frontiers, yet separated by distance —  
Not between us, but between the reality and truth that contradict us.  
Cheek by jowl, we hold on to what keeps us  
Alive in the midst of what kills us.  
But where will it lead us?  

We're like birds, but we can't fly —  
Because it sinned us.  

Does it ever feel better?  
Mistake after mistake,  
Just to fulfill a destiny?  
I wanted the ending to be beautiful,  
But I don’t want to see the end.  
How paradoxical it is — to hope for something good when it's over,  
Yet not want it to be over.  

Sure, I'm in love with you.  
And it’s the kind of love that’s been tattooed into my body,  
A kind of love carved into my bones.  

You are my untold story —  
A priceless treasure I hid in a jar,  
A perfect dress I locked in the closet,  
And the tears I covered with a smile.  
You are my untold story.  
The forever great love of my life.  
Our love may not be visible,  
But it's written in the stars.  
```

Me and my partner recently bought a Delonghi Magnifica S auto coffee machine, but it continues to make watery coffee. 

It’s really bad, and I have tried to fix it with no luck. 
I tried adjusting grind size, but I’ve found no difference no matter the size adjustment. Also yes, I only adjusted it one bit at a time, while the machine is running, resulting in a huge waste of my coffee beans :(
I have the coffee amount to max, I don’t really understand how to adjust the water levels but supposedly I tried. 
I just timed how long a normal shot took to come out, and readjusted it to be a little less longer, hoping it decreased the water levels. 
Please help, I really don’t know what else to do to fix it. I’m not too much of a coffee nerd, more of a beginner, I know the basics but when it comes to measurements and ratios and all of that I’m dumbfounded.

In April, I noticed his lifestyle looked very comfortable — spending ₹250 on coffee, living in a house with ₹60,000 rent, and so on. He convinced me to invest ₹6 lakh in his other startup related to manufacturing. Believing him, I even borrowed money from my mother and gave it to him.

Later, in September, I found out that he had also taken ₹5 lakh from different people under different pretexts. One of my mutual friends gave him money, and some others didn’t.

I prepared myself a coffee, ate some fruit, and went outside. I got on my motorcycle—it was a super sport bike—and I rode to a hangar located behind the city center.

I scanned it, entered a pin, and then the elevator opened. I got in and went down quite a few floors, but there were only 2 levels: the one I got on and the one I would get off.

When I got off, I saw a room—this room was as big as the hangar, even bigger. Every side of it was covered with plates twice the size of a human, and the room was rectangular. In the middle, there were two semicircles made of hexagons, cut right down the middle by a platform. Under this platform, inside another hexagonal circle, there was a sphere, completely metallic. On the platform itself, four metallic extensions came in from the sides toward the center. Besides that, on the left and right sides of the machine there were servers—supercomputers. At the front, the side I entered from, there was a desk with a normal computer setup of three monitors. A person was sitting there. To the left, four people were monitoring the four servers placed side by side. On the right side, there was a gap between two servers and then two more. Facing those right-side servers, further back in the room, there were three people. On my side, two people. And in the middle, three people preparing the pilot who would use the machine. On top of the machine itself, one person was standing.

Then I walked to the person standing next to the computer and said something. After that, I went to the pilot and spoke with him a little, checked his helmet and suit. Then I went over to the people monitoring the servers on the left. Finally, the person standing on top of the machine began walking toward me when I arrived in front of it. There were glass stairs leading up to the machine. This person was a tall, blonde woman in formal clothing, holding a checklist. Like me, she was doing inspections. She told me, “Our investor will definitely be satisfied with this.” But deep inside, I knew I didn’t like her much. Then, as she joined us, everyone else stepped back. We stood behind the computer, and the pilot stepped onto the machine’s platform.

I told the computer operator to start. Immediately, the metallic sphere beneath the hexagonal barrier began to spin, endlessly. Then the arms started moving, and the upper hexagonal dome began to close. The metallic sphere, along with its hexagonal barrier, rose through the solid platform and came to the point where the four extensions met. At the same time, gravity disappeared in the room, and we all started floating in midair. I was positioned directly in front of the sphere, aligned with it. The only one unaffected by the loss of gravity was the pilot—he still had it.

Then, from the hexagonal-shielded sphere, a bright blue light shone. The moment I saw that light, I felt as if I had lived thousands of different lives. Right after that, everyone suddenly dropped to the floor, and I saw that the pilot had vanished.

I had this dream. Now here’s the interesting part: I experienced this dream in such a vivid, indistinguishable way that I was absolutely convinced it was real. I was around 25 years old in the dream, but when I had it, I was only in the 3rd year of middle school (out of a 4-year system). What’s strange is this: none of the people I saw in that dream, at that time, were people I knew in real life. In fact, I saw them as their older selves. But as I grew up, I ended up meeting them—some in high school, some in university, some through friends of friends. And now, at 22, I’ve met everyone from that dream except for the blonde woman on the platform.

My question to you is: how could I have seen in a dream, back in middle school, the 25-year-old versions of people I didn’t know yet, only to later meet them in real life? Does this possibility make the reality of the dream stronger?",6,1757557575.0,DreamInterpretation,2,1.0,False

For quick backstory/stats, I am a 50 HLM married to a 48 LLF. Since we had sex to conceive our son 11 years ago, we’ve had 6 sexual encounters. Our DB has a lot of reasons - inability to communicate about sex, her mental health and trauma issues, COVID, parenting, etc. BUT, of the 6 sexual encounters in the past 11 years, 2 have been in the past few weeks - Yay!

One (maybe) important data point is that I haven’t initiated at all over the past 11 years, though I have expressed my desire for her a few times and in the past couple of year, I have asked multiple times to talk about our sex life, but it has never really happened.

A few weeks ago, I decided to try initiating…I ended up giving her a massage that night which ended up with my hands down her pants, getting her off. This last weekend, I again asked if we could do something physical. She wasn’t feeling up for it that night, but said we would do something the following night - which we did! She was really into it and we had a good time including ending the night with intercourse.

I let her know the following day that it was a really special and connecting night, but I want to bring it up again with her soon. I really feel like we’ve turned a corner here, and I am wondering how much of it was just me needing to start initiating again. But this is where I’d love the perspective of any LL women who have recovered a DB:

1) This last time, she got close to orgasm but didn’t make it there. I am not sure if/how to bring it up. I don’t want to put an pressure on her to feel like I want/need her to orgasm. At the same time, I want to make sure if we are going to revive our sex life that it is good/satisfying for her. Any advice here on how to talk about whether these two recent encounters were satisfying for her

2) I feel like in part we are where we are because I was finally able to express my own needs/wants in a clear way, and she has been very receptive to that. Along the same line, I want to find a way to talk more about where we are and where we can go from here…BUT I don’t want to push too hard to seem too overbearing. For any women who have been in this early part of recovering a DB, how would you want your partner to have reacted/talked to you about where to go from here?

3) We have a regular Friday coffee date. I want to take a few minutes this week to just let her know how much I love that we have found our way to a place where I can initiate, she can turn me down/push it off, but we do find a way to connect. This seems so silly, but it really is as meaningful to me as the actual sex itself. Is this something worth expressing? 

I don’t know if anyone has perspective on the dynamic we are in now, but would love any advice anyone could offer here!",3,1757557547.0,DeadBedrooms,2,0.81,False

Nowhere else has a sustainable place for my thoughts in... my reality, at the moment. So for that reason, I hope this isn't taken down by moderators.

Kirk was an abhorrent piece of shit who would do and say most things to draw a reaction out of a crowd. He liked it- he used rhetoric to justify every facet of hate that he could come up with. I don't know whether or not he really believed his daughter should have to deliver a baby if it is forced upon her. But he did say that to argue a point.   
He said that every life a bullet took was worth it to hold a gun in America. I think he did not value the lives of people that opposed him or stood in his way. And if he did, I've seen no evidence of him indicated that he *did.* The image that he projected was a purely hateful one demonstrating the worst of the MAGA movement. Several lives have probably been worse off because of what he's said.

Did he deserve it? I don't know. If you believe that a life is only valued exactly by the actions you take- I don't think he made any good decisions on his behalf. At best, he was incredibly greedy and ready to betray every virtue possible to line his pockets. At worst, he was incredibly hateful and believed that his demented philosophies were driving this country down a good path. 

\-

All of this being said, if you celebrate his death, you are a ***huge*** part of the problem.

I'm not of the perspective that just because he was a loving father and husband for that reason alone you should be shocked and horrified at people celebrating his death. I am saying this because hate and anger is blind, ignorant, and stupid.

I saw someone today comment in this subreddit today something like: ""I would advocate for shooting them all, except for the fact that our side would lose some too."" And I cannot tell you how alien that sentiment is to me. The left vs. right argument has become so extremified it is now cartoonish. Reality is so cartoonish that nobody believes in it anymore. Our leading democracy is purely self-interested, and pedestrians are so busy on their phones they will no longer make eye contact with the person who makes their coffee. Let alone even attempting to help someone in need.   
I'm not attached to the internet. I know good people still exist and I know them well. But on a whole, something has happened. Media worked- society shifted- and there are simply more people without a soul than there ever has been.

The real problem with Luigi is that the vigilante that takes his place won't know their right arm from their left, and decide to shoot Conan O'Brien or Billie Eilish because they are capitalist-scum that has profited off a corruptive system that left the rest of us in the dust. That's what you saw here today.  
  
No matter what Charlie advocated for, realistically his listeners were already hooked into the rabbit hole and looking for even more reasons to be hateful. His death does nothing but aggravate a sore muscle. He's a *bad target* picked by a fucking moron. This does nothing to disable a movement. Only radicalize it. And again and again every year it happens on 'both sides' and every single year it gets worse. The world spins quicker until we're all paste on the pavement. I remember reading what people thought about the two Democratic senators being shot and the people celebrating their deaths look exactly the same as the people celebrating Kirk's death today.

All because some news sites wanted some clicks and some money. 

\-

There will be no revolution in America. There is no King Louis XVI to point at and blame for everything. People are too scattered, and the land is too massive. It will literally just be fighting and more fighting until... people will just be worse off.

Yes, Ethan and Hila are in (hypothetical) danger. All it takes is one in the millions of people who have been motivated by Hasan's cronies who have been bathing in an environment where getting rid of ""Zionists"" is a great thing. To be clear, Hasan is in danger too. I don't know, does HASAN deserve it? Where do you draw the shooting people line? Nobody listens, anymore. Nobody cares what each other has to say past the initial THING that made them angry. Whether misinformed or otherwise.

We are now in an environment where it's societally 'okay' to do this, and it's been proven to be effective more than once. And I think it's... inevitable. Because of our media, because of our government, because people are bored and want the pendulum to shift. You've seen it in history and you've seen it in psyche. There were what, 2 other school shootings today? The news doesn't care to cover it because they don't profit off of it. Hatred and ignorance is winning and I'm so sick of it. This isn't the norm, this wouldn't have been in the past.

I thought it was crazy growing up but I can honestly say the drug Haldol 2mg was the trick to recovery for me. It’s like the lowest dose but enough relaxation to control the ticks and stims without getting tired. Please consult with your doctor first as guys may not be the right treatment for everyone. It works right away and usually you can the it at night beside bed and it regulate the ticks and stims the next day.

Please reach back out to let us know if it ever helped a tone else. When I drink coffee I tick out very bad. It seems like in the morning my head is the clearest and by night time I’m a waking tick bomb! It’s also because of the caffeine I consume during the day.

I eat a very clean diet and keep the toxins out except for coffee. Ha, I do t drink alcohol anymore but that worked but wasn’t my right thing to do.

When I mediate it helps. What I found out was right when you feel the urge to tick, concentrate on something else for 10 seconds and it passes. Being nearly 47 years old I have learned a lot the tricks to contain it. At times I have to go in the bathroom and freak out! Ha, but that’s on bad days. I feel like when I’m outside in fresh air it helps and when is crazy when  I sit on my couch and watch tv. The nervous energy is too much so I try to think about the beach for 10 seconds. I Also  learned to scratch my arm or do something other than tick to help the urge go away.

The worst of my ticks happens when it gets stuffy and warm inside the home when I keep my AC on 61 compare to 67 degrees it mates a night and day difference.

Once again this is speaking  for myself only just if any one of you want to try the after alternatives take what you want from this message and leave the rest.

It’s also hard and disappointing they do t go night researching on this to find a cure!  They can find out how to clone things are have a robot act as a human but motion with Tourette’s. It’s probably an easy cure to soft part of the brain to adjusted with medical treatment, laser surgery. It may be just a drug that blocks  the singular in the brain to make us switch or tic. Just like they can get other medicine to block  the nerves from feeling pain.

I live a good life but it’s torture every day without my med. Most days I’m cloudy and not well. If zi to my therapy I’m good to go. I hope this helped anyone who reads it. Please excuse any misspells as well. I typed this very fast on my excerpted bike with one hand! lol

I never thought I’d post in here but my boyfriend (30M) of 4.5 years broke up with me (30F) suddenly after arriving home from a 2 week trip to Europe together. He said we were going to go camping on Friday night to be together without distractions and work on things, and instead he moved his belongings out of our home while I was at work. 

Bit of backstory, we met when we were both 25 in 2021. We had only known each other for about 2 weeks when we found out his Mom had brain cancer. It was a hard beginning to our relationship navigating an exciting time in our lives together while also dealing with a terminal illness of his parent. The first time I met his Mom was after brain surgery, when she came out of the hospital in sock feet and gave me a big hug. 
His mom was sick for the next 2 years before she sadly passed away. We went through so much within that time.

His father has had issues with any females in both his son’s lives and claims that the women are taking them away from him. He never did like me and was rude to anyone he crossed. I’m sure this wasn’t easy for my partner either because there’s nothing him and I wanted more than getting along with great in-laws. 

We had a beautiful relationship. We loved fast and especially in the beginning we both said “when you know, you know”. He told me he loved me after 1 month of being together and I felt that with my entire being. He was kind, compassionate, caring and all around the ideal person for me to start a life with. We remained inseparable throughout our relationship.

We travelled a lot and were constantly doing things every weekend. Continuing weekly date nights when he wasn’t away because he travelled a lot for work and hobbies so that was a hard pill for me to swallow in the beginning. I wanted to be selfish and be with him. 

I don’t have a lot of friends or major hobbies so that bothered him because he knew I would get bored and sometimes sad while he was away and it made him feel guilty. I got over it 2 years into our relationship and learned to enjoy my alone time again to do whatever I wanted. I had lived alone prior to being with him for 5 years. I’m also an only child to a single parent so I spent majority of my childhood in solitude. I never wanted him to feel guilty for leaving me for weeks at a time. I’m a big girl and can handle it. We never really fought or argued during our relationship so in my opinion I thought everything was okay.

Fast forward to last November of 2024, my Mom got extremely sick and ended up in the hospital. She almost died from a staph infection that was caused by an abscess on her spinal cord. She lost all mobility during that time. While being in the hospital for over 3 months, she was also diagnosed with endometrial cancer. My boyfriend stood by me though all of it and we decided it was best to move into her house with her to help out.

February 2025 we moved into my Moms house. We had an agreement that she would “gift” us the house to get a head start in our lives and a place to grow together. We needed to renovate the house before we moved into it so my boyfriend worked hard on the house during my mom’s time in the hospital. The only catch was that the payment of the renovations were tied to a Home Equity Line of Credit that was under my mom’s name and we had to pay off the loan. We picked out appliances, paint, flooring and fixtures and we were both so excited for this new chapter. We were living in basement suites for the last almost 10 years so having a larger place was nice. 

It was only this year that I started actively talking about engagement rings and saying that we’re coming up to our 5 year anniversary and it would be nice to be engaged. Family and friends started asking him and bugging him about it too and I admit it went too far at times. There were words exchanged that I regret saying. Mostly along the lines of how I shouldn’t have to beg for a ring. 

We had a trip planned to Europe (we’re from BC Canada) in August 2025 for two weeks. It was a vacation for us and I would later fly home solo while he was competing in an Olympic level rifle match in the UK for an additional week.
Our trip was great in my opinion, there were zero fights but it was constant go-go-go and extremely hot. This took a toll on my energy and my feet were so swollen. During our trip we weren’t intimate at all. It was on my side of things where I was so exhausted and my body just ached from all the walking and travelling we were doing. Our sex life has slown down a lot because of me. I have gained weight and am no longer comfortable with myself. I also deal with some other mental heath issues that contribute to the matter. He was always understanding about it but I feel so guilty. It was never about not being attracted to one another anymore.

He arrived home a week after me and was only home for 2 days before leaving again for another 4 days. We didn’t get to even discuss our trip and reflect on anything.

He went away to a rifle match and when he came back something had switched. Monday Sept 1, we went for breakfast like normal and went to the shops for groceries. We decided to make cocktails in the backyard and enjoy the last weekend of summer weather. We no sooner sit in the patio and he says “I’ve been thinking that we should breakup”. My hear shattered instantly and I asked if we could go inside to discuss.

He didn’t really have solid reasons, everything he told me were fixable issues such as more alone time, space, finding common hobbies, working on solo hobbies, more intimate time. He left for a couple hours for a drive and returned back that night.
I asked if we could get together the next night to chat and he agreed. We went for a drive and had dinner. The conversation continued for the worst and he still wanted to break up. He agreed to go camping on Friday night just the two of us with no distractions.

What I didn’t know is that he was plotting on emptying the house while I was at work on Friday instead of going camping like he lead me to believe. I got home from work and immediately noticed the coffee maker was gone.  I went to our bedroom and all of his belongings were gone. 

I called him and he said this was the only way he could get it through to me that he was done. 

We met up last night to give me the house key back and chatted for 1.5 hours that went no where except me in tears feeling distraught.
Haven’t slept or eaten much for 6 days now. He’s left me with the debt of this house and unfinished renovations not to mention a very sad little kitty that misses her person. 

I made my first counselling appointment for next week to help me process everything.

I feel like I’m dying inside.

Milk is milk, right? Let’s say so.

My mistake was trying to achieve the perfect balance of sweet, not acidic, not bitter, in the espresso part of the recipe. I succeeded, but I never really got to the flavor of that latte I enjoy at coffee shops.

One day, I ordered a 3-shot latte, but I asked them to put the 3rd shot into its own cup. When I tasted that, I realized why I never got my home latte to taste the same. Their espresso tasted very acidic, sour to the point that I couldn’t enjoy it as an espresso. But my latte was that perfect taste I’ve been craving.

By the way, that 3rd shot was actually a double shot split into two cups, so I know I got consistent shots.

So, I went home, impatiently waited for a couple of hours so I don’t overdose on espresso, and then I dialed it in to produce that sour double shot. But when I mixed it with steamed milk, it wasn’t sour anymore. It was that similar tasting latte I go to coffee shops for. 

I asked. Apparently it’s the blend of acidity of espresso shot and sweetness of milk that gives that distinct flavor that I enjoy. When you mix sweet espresso and sweetness milk, then you just get a chain coffee shop tasting  latte. 

Took years to get to this. For a long time I gave up but finally got it. Talk to your barista and they can teach you lots. ",4,1757557033.0,espresso,1,0.7,False

At the same time, gravity disappeared in the room, and we all started floating in midair. I was positioned directly in front of the sphere, aligned with it. The only one unaffected by the loss of gravity was the pilot—he still had it.

Then, from the hexagonal-shielded sphere, a bright blue light shone. The moment I saw that light, I felt as if I had lived thousands of different lives. Right after that, everyone suddenly dropped to the floor, and I saw that the pilot had vanished.

I had this dream. Now here’s the interesting part: I experienced this dream in such a vivid, indistinguishable way that I was absolutely convinced it was real. I was around 25 years old in the dream, but when I had it, I was only in the 3rd year of middle school (out of a 4-year system). What’s strange is this: none of the people I saw in that dream, at that time, were people I knew in real life. In fact, I saw them as their older selves. But as I grew up, I ended up meeting them—some in high school, some in university, some through friends of friends. And now, at 22, I’ve met everyone from that dream except for the blonde woman on the platform.

My question to you is: how could I have seen in a dream, back in middle school, the 25-year-old versions of people I didn’t know yet, only to later meet them in real life? Does this possibility make the reality of the dream stronger?",1,1757557023.0,Dreams,2,1.0,False

1ndx0ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/comments/1ndx0ju/anything_like_how_the_la_colombe_draft_mocha/,Anything like how the La Colombe Draft Mocha Latte used to be?,"During the pandemic I was addicted to the La Colombe mocha draft lattes. Then they changed the formula and it was definitely worse — took out the “draft” part to replace actual nitrous with a thickener, they reduced the caffeine, changed the chocolate flavor and the whole thing just tasted artificial in a way that it did not before. Recently they changed it again and this time it bears almost no resemblance to coffee or chocolate. The current taste is reminiscent of artificial chocolate protein shakes. Foul. 

Does anyone know of a canned cold brew mocha with regular milk that actually tastes good? Almost all of them now seem to have oat milk and I really don’t enjoy oat milk. ",3,1757556918.0,coldbrew,2,1.0,False

I know there are a lot of posts on here, but I could REALLY use some insight on Atlanta!  I’ll be moving in November for a job, and really have no clue where to look for apartments.  Looking for a neighborhood that offers good options socially (restaurants, coffee shops, bars), has some access to some nature (park or river), and is relatively safe!  My budget max is around $1400 for either a studio or 1B.  Thank you SO much in advance!  Please list any cool spots I should visit as well, I have never been to Atlanta!!
