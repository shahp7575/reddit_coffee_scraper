1lvd9rj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1lvd9rj/i_prioritize_work_when_im_at_the_office_and_plan/,I prioritize work when I'm at the office and plan my day around it and some of my colleagues are confused?,"My company has had a 2-days Work From Home policy for like 3 to 4 years now, and implemented a flex office set-up with an online platform to save the desk you want even months in advance, see who's gonna be at the office at the same time as you etc. I love that, cause our open-spaces are huge, so is the building, so it removes the need to ""look for a desk"" every morning, while at the same time assuring a more effective use of space. You can get your own private desk if you need special accomodations tho. But I don't need it. As long as I have the right amount of screens, a keyboard, an office chair and a desk I'm good to go. And frankly, so are most people. 

But an attendance pattern has emerged where most people are at the office on tuesdays especially, but also thursdays, and the building is more than half empty on mondays, wednesdays and fridays. I get the logic behind it especially for parents but it's bothersome for me because on tuesdays and thursdays there is just SO MUCH NOISE!!!! And the biggest issue with that building is that it's lacking in meeting rooms or even solo rooms for confidential calls, as a result a lot of people stay at their desk to attend meetings on Teams. Then there's the yappers who just HAVE to stand in the middle of the open space, instead of going to a break room or near the coffee machine. 

Thankfully, my whole department works for a huge client that also allows us to have desks at their office (also flex office), but I work with two seperate teams with that client. Team A is super organized when it comes to attendance patterns, everyone has their days, so that the open-space, which is rather small, is never overcrowded nor empty. Team B has a larger open-space but uses it less effectively so they also reproduce the pattern of overcrowding on tuesdays, and half empty if not nearly empty the rest of the week. As a result, i spend tuesdays with team A, and only go to my company office or team B on mondays and thursdays when i know there'll be less people around. The rest of the time i WFH. 

I've been told by some colleagues that they ""never see me"" and I should show up on tuesdays. And it's not like we have work to do together. I'm just ""supposed"" to show up and yap and ""connect"" with them when they feel like it. But like ... 3 different groups of people expect me to be in their open-spaces on tuesdays! Of course I'm gonna prioritze one, and sorry I'll prioritize the less noisy of the 3! And it's wild cause I swear it's the same people who start all tuesday's coffee breaks with ""man, the office is so loud today"" so I'm like ????  They don't want to end WFH days, but at the same time they want to see everyone at the same time like back in the day when we didn't have WFH days? Am I crazy for seeing obvious contradictions here or are those just coffee breaks stock phrases that are not supposed to mean anything? And also, can't i just show up to the office to WORK?",1,1752048834.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

1lvd7p1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lvd7p1,Do megapixels really matter?,"At the moment I have three m43 cameras with different resolution sensors:  
\- 16mp Gx880  
\- 20mp OM-5  
\- 25mp G9II

I was curious how much megapixels matter, so I did a quick test.   
Probably the highest resolution lens I have is the Leica 200m f2.8, so to eliminate the lens as the limiting factor, I used that.

I took pictures with similar framing, all handheld, all electronic shutter. From about 6 - 8 pictures with each, I chose the sharpest ones. Even with the G9II dual IS, some of the pictures were blurry, probably because I just had my morning coffee.

The pictures are all center crops. Just looking at them, at 100% on screen, there isn't a huge difference. But I was curious, how much real data is there in the raw files, so after exporting them at real size, I applied SuperResolution in Lightroom. 

The pictures in order: G9II SR, G9II, Gx880 SR, Gx880, OM-5 SR, OM-5

To my eyes, when looking at the images on computer screens (even 4k), there isn't a significant difference. Probably the superresolution version is a good approximation of how much difference there would be in a huge print. And there, the 25mp G9II really pulls ahead. But I suspect that besides megapixels, the newer technology of the sensor also captures better data.

Because Reddit usually butchers picture quality, I uploaded them to imgur too: [https://imgur.com/a/m43-megapixels-J9Jz2ox](https://imgur.com/a/m43-megapixels-J9Jz2ox)  
Best to download them from there, and open them at 100%.

My take on it:

If everything is the same, choose the newer and higher resolution sensor.   
But in real life situations, the features of the camera matter more than just higher pixel count.  
If you find a camera that is a better match for your shooting style, just go for that, forget about megapixels.  
  
The last two times when I could have used the G9II, I just grabbed the OM-5 because it's plenty enough as image quality goes, it's lighter, and I enjoy it much more. And when size really matters, I have the Gx880 with the 20mm f1.7 that provides the best possible image quality for that size.

PS: the 200mm f2.8 is really freakin' sharp. It still outresolves even the G9II, so there is room to grow on the system for better sensors.",2,1752048590.0,M43,1,1.0,False

The environment of filth and war and violence has infected these kids that way.

There is a curfew in Ukraine at midnight.  If you arrive late, there is a section in the station that allows soldiers to stay until the metro opens.  You won’t be hassled as long as you act like a responsible adult.  

There are plenty of places to eat and shop in the area. There is a coffee shop with drinks/food in the station that stays open past curfew, too.

Great performance improvements and cool Zelda Notes functionality aside, the thing that this playthrough has made me realize the most about the Switch games is how hard they *nailed* the writing and character building, specifically as it pertains to the characters' relationships with each other. 

Playing through the Champions' Ballad quest line really drives home that the Champions (Zelda included) were more than just pieces of world-building or parts of the overall LoZ monomyth- these were friends, colleagues, siblings in arms, even found family in a sense. They respect each others' skills and rely on them to get out of individual trouble. They actually talk to each other about stuff that doesn't directly pertain to killing Ganon; Zelda asking Urbosa why she calls her ""little bird"" or Daruk admitting he's scared of dogs despite being the fearless tank of the group. I've always loved character-centric storytelling, especially stories about friend groups like this. I couldn't really tell you why- maybe it's because I've always had a pretty small and close-knit friend group throughout my life and I recognize how those bonds get formed, maybe it's just the humanity of finding people you like hanging out with, but whatever it is, I love it. That's what makes the tragedy of seeing them get killed by forces outside their control or full understanding and Link's memory loss in stasis hit so much harder. You can imagine what it would be like to lose your own friends and forget about them, the pain of not even knowing what you don't know about your own past and not being able to conjure good memories to crowd out the bad ones.

Circling back to Champions' Ballad, the final cutscene of the main group taking the picture almost brought a tear to my eye this time. Forgive me for sounding like a fanfic writer but...man, all of these characters deserved better lives. I completely get why AU fanfic projects are as popular as they are, because I want to see a story where this group gets to live long, fulfilling lives and help each other improve as people. Perhaps as employees in a coffee shop, if you must do it that way. (/s) I guess Age Of Calamity kind of gave us that via time-travel shenanigans, and I do really like that game's story, but dammit, I need more! 

Sorry to gush, I'm sure this sounds lame as hell to most people and I'm certainly aware that enough ink has been spilled over how great BotW is to flood a city block. This is just one of those things I have to get out into the world in writing or it will rattle around my head until it falls out my ear.",4,1752048358.0,zelda,1,1.0,False

We’re building an **instant win prize system** for a shopping platform and trying to get the math right on odds and prize distribution. Here's the structure:

* We’ll have **15 different prize types**, ranging from low-ticket items (e.g., $5 coffee vouchers) to high-ticket prizes (e.g., $1000+ tech).
* Each prize type has:
   * A set **unit cost**
   * A fixed **quantity cap**
   * A defined **odds of being won per entry** (e.g., 1 in 225 for coffee, 1 in 1,350,000 for a MacBook)
* The **competition ends** when we either:
   * Hit **1,000,000 total entries**, or
   * Hit a **6-month duration limit**
* Not all prizes need to be awarded — just probabilistically possible.
* Odds per prize are structured assuming **1 million total entries**, and the system checks down the prize list (or a shuffled version) per entry.
* Once a prize’s inventory runs out, it’s skipped for future draws.

 The goal: **structure the odds and quantities** such that the **expected cost across all 1M entries works out to \~$0.10 per entry** (so \~$100,000 in total prize cost), without guaranteeing every prize is hit.

**What we’re wondering:**

* What is the best way to model this simply?
* Are there better models or formulas that account for variance in early wins (e.g. someone winning a rare prize early on) or ways to simulate this to stress-test?
* If we removed quantity cap would that assist? And just keep probabilities? Or if =  no stock left the entry then just retries again until either no win or win = in stock? 

Would appreciate any help from people who’ve done statistical modeling or sweepstake-style probability distributions before.

Im working on a platform thats been on my mind for a while, and i would really love your honesty feedback.

Most social platforms today feel performative. We are expected to be funny, polished or already someone before we can be real. 

But what about the small, honest moments of everyday life? Like “the stranger I met in the coffee shop”, “felt proud after doing something ”

These small moments are emotionally real, but there’s rarely a space for them online without judgment or pressure. 


I need honest feedback: 

1. Do you think there’s a real market for this kind of platforms ?
2. What challenges, blind spots, or risks do you see early on ? 


Deeply appreciate any feedback, even if it’s critical.

1lvd2st,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blogging/comments/1lvd2st/midlife_crisis_or_new_hobby/,Mid-Life Crisis or New Hobby?,"I started a new blog three months ago. I still don’t know if it’s a mid-life crisis or just a new hobby… or maybe both? But what I *do* know is that I’m very excited about it and truly enjoying the process.

My blog is about traveling, but it specifically caters to Spanish speakers (especially people from Puerto Rico) because of the tone and language I use. I’m a Puerto Rican who loves to travel with my family, so I thought I’d share my experiences and recommendations while staying true to my voice and personality. That’s how I hope to connect with people.

The goals of my blog are:

1. To inspire others to travel the world by showing how I do it, despite a recent Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis and having a young daughter.  
2. To provide practical tools and tips for people who want to travel and plan their own trips.  

At the very least, if someone can enjoy reading about my trips from their couch, coffee (or wine) in hand, then my heart will be happy.

The idea for the blog was impulsive, which is something very new for me since I’m usually an overthinker. Over the years, people have suggested I create a page about my trips because they’ve enjoyed following my posts on social media. But my response was always, “Forget it, that has to be a ton of work.”

Fast forward to April 2025, while in the middle of a multi-country trip with my family, several people mentioned they’d love to see a copy of my itinerary. I joked a few times, “I should just start a blog.” Then, during dinner in Istanbul, eating kebabs, I said out loud, “You know what? I’m starting the blog.” I even picked the name that night: *Pasaporte Ready*. I wanted the name to be something intuitive and in Spanglish that tells people what the blog is about while giving them a taste of the tone I use.

Since returning from the trip in early April, I dove straight into getting everything set up. I’m not tech-savvy at all, but my amazing husband and supportive brother-in-law have helped tirelessly to build the website just how I imagined it. Meanwhile, I’ve been pouring hours into writing content and setting up everything behind the scenes that I could think of.

After 9 pages, 23 posts, Instagram and Facebook accounts with 9 posts each, and 5 affiliate links, I finally decided to share the blog with my friends and family a week ago. Since then, I’ve started to see growth little by little on my social media pages—and even my blog, with 4 impressions! The numbers are small, but I feel so proud of myself!

I feel excited, nervous, and—if I’m being honest—sometimes a little overwhelmed. Excited about all the new possibilities. Nervous about putting myself (and my family, including my baby girl) out there, especially since I’m more of an introvert. And sometimes overwhelmed because all I wanted to do was write blogs to help and inspire people… but now I’ve realized this feels like a full-time job: content creation, managing social media (aka becoming an influencer—something I never in a billion years thought I’d do), learning new tools like Canva and WordPress, figuring out SEO… and so on, and so on!

But honestly? I think I’m more excited than anything else, and I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me.

But honestly? I think I’m more excited than anything else, and I can’t wait to see where this journey will take me!

**Daily Use (mainly for gym and casual wear):**

1. **Afnan Supremacy Collector’s Edition** – saw a reel and loved the idea, but I can’t find it for a good price in Canada. ([noel reel link](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLKtcj0xaYs/)) love the pineapple on paper.

3. **Nikos Sculpture Homme** – recently saw a video on it, looks promising, but wondering if it's a better pick than the others above? ([noel reel link](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLiT6KZRo34/))

**Special Occasion Pick:**

* **Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa** – thought this could be a great sweet/boozy type for special nights or winter. i loved the idea of coffee in it , cause i love it

Performance/long lasting could be a deal breaker.

There’s something special about waking up to the sound of birds instead of alarms, making coffee as the sun rises, and feeling completely disconnected from all the noise back home.

I didn’t crush huge miles or chase crazy peaks this time — I focused on slow mornings, taking photos, journaling, and just being present.

I realized that sometimes the best part of backpacking isn’t the big summit photo, but those quiet little moments when you feel truly alive and at peace.

“Thank you so much for visiting Elite San Antonio, and I hope your experience with us was pleasurable. Good night Mr. and Mrs. Porter,” Arianna said with a tight smile on her face.

She had worked a double that day, and her dogs were barking, courtesy of her Chanel patent leather pumps. Normally, Arianna wouldn’t have dreamed of purchasing something so expensive, but a coworker put her on a luxury consignment website with reasonable prices on luxury name-brand clothing and shoes. The plus side was that Arianna could pay in monthly installments, saving her from pinching pennies at the end of the month.

Elite San Antonio was a state-of-the-art country club new to the city, and everyone fortunate enough to be a member had deep pockets, power, and an ego the size of the state of Texas. Coincidentally, the owner expected the staff to look the part as well.

“Thank you, Arianna. As usual, your service was wonderful,” Mr. Porter grinned, offering his hand.

“You’re very welcome. Will I see you and Mrs. Porter next week, same time?” Arianna asked, accepting his hand.

“Of course, dear, at our usual time. Take care, Arianna.”

“Good night, Mrs. Porter. Please don’t forget about yoga tomorrow at 9:00 AM with Mrs. Hendricks and Mrs. Murphy,” Arianna reminded her.

“Thank you so much for the reminder. I’ll be here!”

Arianna finished saying her polite farewells and collapsed in her chair as soon as the couple exited through the rustically crafted arched double doors. Arianna looked into the palm of her hand and was thrilled at the sight of the crisp but folded $50.00 bill that Mr. Porter blessed

her with. Her nose wrinkled in disgust when she noticed he also left a little note inside the folded bill to call him.

Fielding the ongoing advances of their members was the only downfall of Arianna’s job as a receptionist. She was also sometimes expected to act as a personal concierge even though it wasn’t in her job description. Arianna was hit on from the time she arrived in the morning until she called it a day and was safely in her vehicle. There was only one case where a member went too far. He was drunk, overly vulgar, and groped her before being escorted out. A part of Arianna felt disgusted and violated by his behavior, but he apologized the next day and gave her a check for $5,000.00 to show he was “sincere.”

Arianna was quick to accept the check and informed him all was forgiven. Arianna didn’t mind accepting his payoff as long as her lights remained on and she still had a place to rest her head at night. The money also made an excellent contribution to her college fund. If Arianna was candid, she hoped it would happen again so that she could get another check. Arianna wasn’t a whore, but she also wouldn’t look a gift horse in the mouth.

Arianna wished she could say it was only the men in love with the cocoa, but she was approached by many women who wanted to engage in a dalliance or desired to have a threesome with her and their husbands. Arianna, of course, turned them down; however, she couldn’t turn

down Mrs. Klein, who requested a massage. That massage came with a $1,000.00 tip, and Arianna wasn’t required to scissor or eat her pussy. That was a win in her book.

Arianna recently graduated from high school and had plans to attend college. She relied on the college fund her deceased grandparents left to get her through the next four years. She was accepted to a decent school and was assigned a roommate. Arianna purchased a new laptop and

other supplies and couldn’t wait until she started the next chapter of her life.

It wasn’t until the week before school started that her parents called her into the living room and confessed they spent her entire college fund on trips to Louisiana for expensive gambling excursions. There were no words to express how betrayed Arianna felt by the two people that were supposed to love and care for her. If she couldn’t trust her own parents to have her back, then who could she trust?

Arianna cried that night as she logged into the school’s website, dropped all her classes, and unenrolled herself. She emailed her roommate to let her know that something had come up and she wouldn’t be joining her for the year. Arianna was at least grateful she had decided to hold off on purchasing her textbooks just in case she found them in the school’s library. One less thing she had to worry about.

Arianna was disgusted by her parents’ selfishness and refused to stay under their roof another day. The next day, she scraped up the last bit of her funds she had saved from a part-time job and found a lovely studio apartment to rent at a reasonable price, all bills included. The only issue was that her part-time job at the local bookstore wouldn’t pay the rent. Arianna had a month to find a job, or she would be out on her ass.

It didn’t take Arianna long to stumble upon the online ad for the receptionist position at Elite SA. Arianna immediately beefed up her resume and submitted the application. She was surprised to receive a call back that very day requesting she come in for a job interview the following day.

Arianna accepted and then gasped in horror once she realized she didn’t know what to wear for her interview. Arianna had never been to a country club before, but she’d heard enough to know that something sleek, stylish, and professional would be preferred.

Arianna dressed in a black sheath dress with long mesh sleeves that cuffed at the wrist for her interview. She paired her outfit with a pair of black pumps and diamond studs. Arianna arrived for her interview twenty minutes early and was floored by the rows of expensive luxury cars parked in the compound.

Arianna’s parents were bastards for spending her college fund, but at least she had a decent car. Her 2017 Honda Civic was still a hoopty compared to the Bentley she parked by, but it could’ve been worse.

\*\*\*

“Good morning, ma’am. First time here?” the doorman asked.

“How could you tell?”

“I know almost everyone,” he bragged. “My name is Jesse, and you are?”

“Arianna. I’m here for the receptionist interview.”

Jesse’s eyes widened in recognition. “Well, if that’s the case, let me escort you to the office.”

“Don’t you have to watch the door?”

“Eh, fuck ’em. They have two hands. They can open their own doors.”

“Don’t come crying to me when you lose your job.”

“Never,” Jesse chuckled. “The boss and I are tight.”

“How tight?”

“He’s my grandfather.”

“And you’re opening doors? Sounds like he doesn’t love you that much.”

“He despises nepotism.”

“In that case, he sounds like a fair and honorable man.”

“He’s all that and then some,” Jesse replied, offering Arianna his arm.

Arianna looped her arm through his and allowed him to lead her through the main building. “Elite” perfectly described the club. The cream-colored marble floors were clean enough that you could eat off of them.

The multiple Swarovski crystal chandeliers were almost blinding in the sunlight. The hand-painted oil paintings that donned the walls were most likely originals by some famous Renaissance painters Arianna knew she couldn’t pronounce the names of.

Everyone they passed had smiles on their faces, and as far as Arianna could tell, the smiles were all genuine.

“Everyone looks so happy,” Arianna commented as Jesse continued to drag her deeper through the building.

“Elite SA is like Disney World for the rich. There are a host of activities to participate in. There’s golf, tennis, yoga, you can get a massage, and there’s a casino where we host slot, poker, and Blackjack tournaments. What else? There’s a movie theater, a basketball and racquetball court, cricket, horses, an indoor Olympic swimming pool, and a tropical-style swimming pool and hot tub outside. There is a world-class Michelin star chef on staff, and he’ll make anything your little heart desires. If we don’t have it, then we’ll fly it in. You want oysters, sweetheart? Not a problem. We’ll fly you in some fresh from the Delta de l’Ebre.”

“Sounds fancy...and expensive.”

“Yes, to both, but you pay for quality. What else do we have? A full salon where our female guests love to get their nails and toes done as well as get their assholes waxed and bleached.”

“I could’ve gone without that,” Arianna giggled.

“My bad. I just wanted to make you laugh.”

“Mission accomplished.”

“Well, we’re here. My lunch break is coming up soon, so you can celebrate your employment with me in the dining room if you want. What are you feeling?”

“Hmmmmmm. I think I’m feeling oysters.”

“If I didn’t know any better, Arianna, I would think you’re trying to get me into bed,” Jesse said with a sly grin on his face.

“You couldn’t be further from the truth. You’re nice and all, but I’m looking for someone a little bit on the older side. What are you, 21 or 22?”

“21, and how old are you?”

“18.”

“Well, how old are we talking here?” Jesse inquisitively asked.

“Older than 21, I can tell you that.”

“I feel like you just friend-zoned me.”

“You have great intuition,” Arianna teased.

“You say that now, but I bet I could have you changing your mind.”

“I doubt it, but I’ll find you after my interview, yeah?”

“Sure thing, Ari.”

“Only my closest friends call me Ari.”

“Wonderful. I’m glad we see eye-to-eye. Good luck, but I don’t think you’ll need it for some reason.”

Arianna watched Jesse as he walked down the hallway. He was nice enough, but Arianna wasn’t one for playing games, and she didn’t want to mess around and fall for fuck boy.

Arianna only had one boyfriend in her life, and that relationship was very short-lived. She was ten days in when she found out he had another girlfriend at a rival high school. Arianna quickly ended what they had and swore off boys until she was out of school. As a result, Arianna was still a virgin and was happy to remain one until she felt ready. Now that Arianna no longer had anything to focus on, she was legal and open to the idea of being sexually and romantically involved with someone, preferably someone older. Arianna wanted her first time to be with someone who had some experience under his belt.

Perhaps someone at the club will catch her eye? It is teeming with older gentlemen.

Three months later, Arianna quickly realized the club offered slim pickings to suit her needs and tastes. All of the men were married or in a relationship, and hardly any of them cared. Arianna had completely given up when she found out from Jesse that some of the members had a running bet to see who could bed her first.

“You did great today, as usual, Miss Carter,” her boss, Mr. Bruce, complimented, laying it on a little too thick. Arianna rolled her eyes, knowing if Mr. Bruce was paying her a compliment that he wanted something. Mr. Bruce wasn’t a bad boss or cruel by any means, but he could be strict, and genuine compliments were challenging to come by. Arianna noticed that his tone became lighter than usual whenever he wanted a favor. Not to mention he never smiled except when he wanted something.

“Let’s cut to the chase, Mr. Bruce. Tomorrow is my day off, but you’re going to ask me to come in, aren’t you?”

“Wow, you know me so well, Miss Carter. We have a couple of last-minute tours that need to be given, and unfortunately, we’re going to be short-staffed tomorrow. Would you be willing to give the tours? Remember, if they become members, you’ll get a sign-on bonus of $1,000.00.”

“How many tours?”

“Three.”

“Do you have their profiles?” Arianna sighed.

“Here you are,” Mr. Bruce beamed, shoving three portfolio books toward her. “Sorry, there aren’t any photos. Like I said, last minute.”

“No worries. When is the first tour?”

“10:00 AM.”

“That’s not bad. I’ll be here. Make sure you have my $3,000.00 check waiting for me at the end of the day.”

“Miss Carter, you are so cheeky and quite full of yourself, aren’t you?”

“It’s a gift,” she sighed, grabbing her purse out of the locked bottom drawer of her desk. “I’ll see you tomorrow. Good night, Mr. Bruce.”

“Good night, Miss Carter.”

\*\*\*

Arianna arrived home ten minutes later and was immediately bombarded by her munchkin cat. “How’s it going, Legs? Did you miss Mama?” she cooed as he tangled himself between her feet.

Arianna brushed Legs aside with her heel because the last thing she wanted was to impale her furry friend with her spiked heel.

She tossed the profiles onto her bed and fed Legs before he meowed the apartment down.

Another positive thing about working at the club was that she barely had to purchase groceries because breakfast, lunch, and dinner were served at the club and were an employee perk, along with free use of all of the facilities, including the gym.

Arianna leisurely showered and thoroughly moisturized her skin with her body oil. She threw on an oversized t-shirt and didn’t bother with panties because she knew she would touch herself before falling asleep.

“Let’s see who we got here, Legs,” Arianna sighed, bouncing onto the bed. “Mr. London, Mr. Jameson, and Mr. White. Hopefully, they’re more impressive than their names.”

# Enough is Enough

“I can’t take this anymore. You are truly pathetic!” Pierce’s best friend Patrick exclaimed.

Patrick flung open the curtains to allow sunlight to penetrate the dark and morose atmosphere. Patrick visited Pierce to get him out of the house but had no such luck.

Pierce turned into an absolute recluse after his divorce and retirement three months ago. Pierce would hardly ever answer his phone, and when he did answer it, it was only to immediately turn down all invitations to social outings. Patrick was aware Pierce was always a homebody, and it was his ex-wife Stella who would force him out of the house against his will. The problem was that she would consistently parade Pierce around like a show pony in their social circles.

Stella never treated Pierce like he was her beloved husband, more like he was her precious object. She was always obsessed with wealth and status, and Pierce had almost run himself into the ground to meet Stella’s covetous demands. And how did Stella repay him for his years of

devotion, patience, and love? She cheated on Pierce with his boss, who could provide her with bigger and better. Stella always had to have the newest, the biggest, and most of all, the most expensive things that money could buy. Still, it was never good enough to satiate her greedy appetite for the finer things in life.

Patrick recalled a dinner he attended at the White household six months ago and grimaced at the memory of him ducking out early due to Stella’s spoiled brat behavior. They were having a polite conversation at the dinner table when Patrick shared he was going to the dealership the following day to pick up his brand new custom-made 2021 Rolls-Royce Ghost.

Unknowingly, Patrick brought up a tender subject in the White household. The next scene was absolutely appalling to Patrick. Stella threw a tantrum about how everyone they knew was driving 2021s while she was stuck “slumming” it through the city in her 2020 Bentley Continental GT.

Patrick stared at Pierce, waiting for him to put Stella in her place; however, Pierce’s expression remained stoic while he humbly ate his roasted lamb chop as if Stella didn’t even exist.

It was then that Patrick realized his best friend had thoroughly checked out of his marriage and was familiar with Stella’s verbal and emotional abuse. Stella continued to rant and rave about how Pierce wasn’t good enough for her and what one man wouldn’t do, then another one would. Patrick wasn’t one to promote violence against women, but he wouldn’t have minded if Pierce had hauled off and slapped the taste out of Stella’s mouth. Stella didn’t deserve Pierce, and she sure as shit didn’t deserve the life Pierce provided her.

Pierce never asked much of Stella. He wanted a child, just one, but she was too selfish to give him that. She complained that a child would ruin her perfect figure and would be too much of a hassle. Patrick scoffed at that statement..he’d seen better bodies, and Stella knew Pierce would pay good money to get her a tummy tuck or a breast lift if she wanted it. Hell, Pierce already did several years ago for her birthday, and she had been hinting at wanting to get some work done to her face this year.

Patrick threw his napkin down on the table and excused himself. He couldn’t stomach the abuse any longer and had lost his appetite at the sight of the dead-eyed look that graced his friend’s face. Stella robbed Pierce of the man he used to be, and it was clear to Patrick that Pierce was sinking into a pit of despair that he may never be able to climb his way out of.

Patrick was elated when he received a call from Pierce a couple of months later, informing him of their impending divorce due to Stella’s infidelity. The shitty part was that Stella was the one who initiated the divorce. She attempted to hire Charlotte Scott, the best divorce attorney in Texas, to represent her. Mrs. Scott took one look at the case and vehemently declined. Being the best meant Charlotte could be selective about the cases she handled, and she didn’t have to compromise her morals to do it. In fact, Mrs. Scott reached out to Pierce and asked if he had representation and offered her services.

Like the cold-hearted bitch she was, Stella gunned for spousal support and half of everything; however, the prenup she signed was airtight, and Mrs. Scott made sure Stella didn’t get a single dime. Patrick was now making it his personal mission to integrate Pierce back into society before it was too late.

“You know...those were the same words Stella said to me before she served me with divorce papers,” Pierce drawled, taking a sip from his coffee.

“My bad,” Patrick mumbled. “Seriously, you need to leave the house. I’m afraid you’ll die alone in this house one day, and I won’t find out about it until several weeks later. It would be best if you had contact with the outside world. Our friends miss you.”

“Those people were never my friends,” Pierce spat. “They were Stella’s friends. I don’t claim them. Especially since none of them have bothered speaking to me since the divorce.”

“Okay, I agree with you there. Most of the people in our circle are stuck-up assholes, but there are some good ones.”

“I doubt it. Plus, I don’t want to be at a social gathering and run into Stella. Since she removed herself, my life has improved exponentially, and I’m afraid seeing her wouldn’t be good for my mental health. I was with the woman for 25 years, and it was a complete waste. I can’t get those 25 years back, so I should at least be able to live out the remaining 25 years that I have left on this Earth Stella-free.”

“You make a very valid point; however, as your nosy, overbearing best friend, I decided to take matters into my own hands.”

“What did you do? Did you sign me up for speed dating or something like that? If you did, you might as well cancel because the last thing I’m looking for is a relationship. I’m perfectly content with dying alone.”

“That’s extremely morbid, but I’m not surprised. Have you heard of Elite San Antonio?”

“That new country club? Yeah, I’ve heard something about it. Why?”

“I scheduled us a tour tomorrow.”

Pierce lowly groaned in frustration. He knew his best friend had nothing but the best intentions for him, but damn, he just wanted to be left alone.

“I know what you’re thinking, but you really need to get out and get some Vitamin D. You can’t go to the old country club because Stella is still a member there, and you’re guaranteed to run into her. Check out the brochure,” Patrick insisted, tossing the colorful pamphlet into Pierce’s lap.

“They have everything you could imagine and then some. Some have described it as the adult version of Disney World.”

“I don’t know, man,” Pierce sighed.

“I’m not asking for a lot. All I’m asking is that you get out of the house and take a stroll. If you don’t like it, then no harm, no foul. At least I could say I tried.”

Pierce mulled the idea in his head. It wouldn’t hurt to give his legs a good stretch and to feel the sun on his skin again. It wasn’t until after his retirement that he realized he didn’t have many hobbies that he took a particular interest in. He was sad to admit that everything he did was to fit in with his wife’s vapid friends or colleagues. At that moment, Pierce realized he was nothing more than a puppet. Why it took him so long to realize this was beyond him. All the signs were there.

“Hello? Is anyone there?” Patrick asked, impatiently snapping in front of Pierce’s face, jerking him out of his self-reflection. “Are you going willingly, or will I have to drag you out kicking and screaming?”

“What time is the tour tomorrow?”

“I scheduled us for 11:30 AM. We can catch lunch there as well.”

“I’ll be there.”

# The Grand Tour

Pierce woke the following day with anxiety bubbling in the pit of his stomach. He tossed and turned throughout the night, wondering if the consequences of bailing on Patrick were worth it.

The thing that got Pierce out of bed was the idea that now that the “puppet master” was out of his life, he was free to reinvent himself however he saw fit.

Pierce dressed in a white polo, khaki pants, and loafers. It was only 10:00 in the morning when he heard his front door unlock and the alarm disengage. Pierce let out a heavy sigh and instantly regretted that Patrick had a key to his house. Patrick insisted the key would only be

utilized for emergencies, but there have been no emergencies in the past three months, yet Patrick has used his spare key a total of ten times.

“Pierce! Up and at ’em!” Patrick called, taking the stairs two at a time. Pierce didn’t bother answering and applied the finishing touches to his hair in the mirror. “Oh wow, I did not expect you to be out of bed.”

“Gotta keep you on your toes, Pat. What are you doing here so early? I told you I would meet you there.”

“I expected you to renege, so I decided I’ll be your escort today,” he explained.

“Oh ye of little faith,” Pierce drawled.

“Stop pretending you haven’t stood me up several times.”

“That was then, and this is now.”

“I hope you walk it like you talk it,” Patrick huffed.

“I guess there’s only one way to find out.”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

“Nice ride, Pat,” Pierce complimented once they left his estate.

“Thanks. It was worth every fucking penny. I can’t believe this is your first time riding in it. Maybe after today, you’ll go get your own.”

“Nah, I’m good. My car is paid off and fits my current and future needs. Plus, it’s too flashy for my tastes.”

“I guess I can’t argue with that.”

The two men made small talk during their short ten-minute drive to Elite SA and were not disappointed when they pulled up to the facility. “Oh wow, the pamphlet did not do this place justice,” Patrick gasped.

“No kidding. I can’t imagine how much the membership dues are,” Pierce agreed with a low whistle.

“Whatever they are, you definitely can afford it, so stop worrying about money.”

“I want to make sure I’m getting my bang for my buck. I don’t want to pay the yearly assessments and only come twice. That would be a dreadful waste of money.”

“I’m sure you’ll find something that will keep bringing you back daily.”

“I won’t hold my breath,” Pierce muttered underneath his breath.

They pulled into the large circular driveway and allowed the valet to park the car. “Good morning, gentlemen. Is this your first time joining us at Elite San Antonio?” the doorman inquired.

“Yes, it is. Thanks for noticing. We’re scheduled for a tour for 11:30,” Patrick replied.

“Ah, yes. Miss Carter just finished a tour not too long ago, and the prospective member is now in the process of establishing membership as we speak. Hopefully, we can say the same for the two of you. My name is Jesse Vanderbilt. It’s a pleasure to meet you both,” the young man beamed, offering an outstretched hand to the men. Pierce shook his hand politely but thought it was peculiar the doorman would be so knowledgeable about more than the comings and goings of the members.

“I know what you’re thinking. Why does this guy know so much, right?”

“Guilty,” Pierce agreed.

“My grandfather owns Elite SA, and one day, it will be mine. I’m just working my way from the bottom up.”

“That’s very admirable,” Pierce complimented.

“Thank you, Mr....”

“White, and this is my buddy Patrick Jameson.”

“Fantastic. Now that we know each other...shall we?” Jesse asked, opening the door for the men.

Pierce quickly scanned the foyer of the compound, taking in all of the luxurious features that screamed “imported.” They stopped in front of an unoccupied receptionist’s desk, giving Pierce more time to peruse his new surroundings.

“Miss Carter should be joining us soon. Just a warning, please be kind to Miss Carter. She may be Mrs. Vanderbilt in the future.”

“What have I told you about telling people that,” a voice scolded from behind Jesse.

“Sweetheart, it’s you that’s in denial. I need you to get with the program,” Jesse teased.

“And I need you to return to your post at the door.”

Pierce didn’t pay any mind to their banter but instead focused his attention on the stunning young woman who stood before him. He couldn’t keep his eyes off of her warm skin tone that reminded him of hazelnut. From what he could tell at first glance, it was blemish-free and appeared smooth to the touch. Her hair was in long braids that were pulled back, allowing a full view of her innocent face and youthful features. She was very petite, and if Pierce had to guess, she was just under five feet tall.

Pierce briefly imagined how weightless she would feel in his arms with her legs wrapped around his waist and her arms around his neck. Pierce would like to say his lewd thoughts died down once she finally made eye contact with him, but they only grew worse. She had expressive cocoa eyes that were surrounded by long black lashes.

She was innocent indeed, and something inside of him wanted to take that innocence for himself. Her plump lips that were painted a velvety red were calling out to him, and he could only pray for an opportunity to taste them. She wore a form-fitting white polo with the Elite SA emblem on the front. The shirt molded beautifully to her small but perky breasts. Her black slacks fit her nicely, and while her ass was small, it rounded out perfectly and was still something to hold onto.

“Get it together...you’re embarrassing me,” Patrick warned from beside Pierce in a low whisper.

“What are you talking about?”

“You are practically drooling over this little girl like she’s a piece of meat, and it’s obvious to everyone, including her. Plus, you don’t have a shot. She looks like she’s barely legal. By the time she was born, you had a mortgage and was cutting back on red meat and junk food.”

Pierce could feel himself awkwardly blush as the young woman smiled at him. He hadn’t felt this way since high school, and it was overwhelming.

“Good morning, Mr. White and Mr. Jameson. My name is Arianna Carter, and I’ll be your tour guide this morning,” she greeted, offering a hand to both men. Pierce was quick to snatch her hand up between the two of his. He pumped it slowly while he stared into her eyes, and an eyebrow quirked in amusement when he noticed how she bit her bottom lip.

“It is very nice to meet you, Miss Carter,” Pierce drawled in his heavy Texas twang.

“Please, Mr. White...call me Ari. All my good friends do.”

# Lust at First Sight

Jesse loudly cleared his throat, interrupting the tender moment shared between Arianna and Pierce. “I’m sorry, sir, but if you hold onto her hand any longer, then I’m going to have to start charging you,” Jesse teased. Arianna kissed her teeth and quickly dropped Pierce’s hand.

“You have some nerve. I’m your future wife one minute, and the next, I’m a prostitute,” Arianna huffed.

“Don’t be like that, Ari. You know I’m just joking, but seriously, hands off the merchandise,” Jesse lowly warned Pierce.

“I got it, I got it. Look, but don’t touch. Ow!”

Pierce found himself rubbing the back of his head from the slap he had just received from Patrick.

“Seriously, Pierce?! You wait good until we get somewhere to start misbehaving. We won’t even be offered membership at the rate you’re going!”

“Jesus...looks like you have your hands full with these two, Ari. I need to get back to the door. I’ll see you tonight,” Jesse declared, giving Arianna a quick peck on the cheek. Arianna let out a huff of frustration because she knew Jesse was showing out like he always did when Arianna

received attention from the opposite sex. Jesse knew they would be nothing more than friends, but he couldn’t help but keep at it, hoping that he’d eventually wear her down.

“I apologize for the unprofessionalism. I promise you we’re usually not like this in front of guests,” Arianna apologized.

“It’s not a problem at all,” Patrick quickly said. “It should be us apologizing. Please forgive my friend. He doesn’t get out of the house much.”

Pierce rolled his eyes at Patrick’s theatrics. He behaved as if Pierce bent the girl over her desk and fucked her until she cried out her safe word.

“No worries,” Arianna beamed, clapping her hands together. “Let’s get started, shall we, gentlemen?”

“Absolutely. Lead the way,” Pierce agreed, knowing he would spend 80% of the tour starting at her backside.

“We’re going to start with a tour of the inside of the facility, and then we’ll head outside. Here you go. My gift to you,” Arianna said, offering the men two Cuban cigars. Pierce quirked his eyebrows in surprise.

“Do you offer all of your potential members Arturo Fuente cigars or only the incredibly handsome ones?”

“You’re so cheeky, Mr. White. You’re gonna find yourself in trouble one of these days,” Arianna teased, snapping her rose gold cigar cutter at him.

“Careful, Ari...you don’t want to hurt yourself with that.”

“I’m good, Mr. White. I’m not the one that should be worried about getting hurt.”

“Uhhhhhhh, excuse me. Let me borrow Mr. White for just one second,” Patrick requested, squeezing himself in between the couple. Patrick dragged Pierce just far enough so that Arianna couldn’t hear them. “What the hell is your problem?!” Patrick whispered.

“I don’t have a problem,” Pierce replied, looking around Patrick to get another good look at Arianna. Pierce sucked in a breath once she bent over to retrieve a piece of paper that had fallen on the floor.

“You have a serious problem. That girl is probably working a little summer job to save up money for her first car, and you are openly flirting with her.”

“I’m sure she’s not that young. She’s probably 18.”

“That’s still not okay. That means she was in high school just a few months ago. Hell, I’m scared.”

“What are you scared of?”

“I can feel it in my bones. She’s going to say she needs to get something from the back and to make ourselves comfortable, and then the next thing you know, Chris Hansen appears, and the cops are waiting for us outside!”

Pierce threw back his head and let out a raucous laugh. “I don’t find this funny, Pierce!”

“Well, I do, and I was due for a good laugh. Thank you.”

“Just...keep it together. I know you’ve just got out of a horrible marriage, and you might feel the need to fuck everything that moves but be smart about it. Plus, I don’t think her boyfriend likes your advances.”

“Boyfriend? Who? The doorman? Naw. He badly wants to be, but he’s not.”

“Uh-huh...you keep telling yourself that.”

Pierce’s mood dampened a little bit once they walked back to Arianna. He knew his chances to catch the beautiful young woman’s eye were slim, but she appeared to enjoy his subtle advances. Hell, she was giving it to him as good as he gave it to her. Pierce felt their brief exchange was mutual, and he didn’t feel like he was coming off as a creepy old man. In fact, Arianna told him to call her Ari. Arianna didn’t offer that same courtesy to Patrick, and to Pierce, that meant something.

“Okay, you guys spent quite a bit of our time gossiping in the corner about me, and we’ve fallen slightly behind schedule. Let’s get to it. Make sure you keep up, and please, please, please ask questions as we go. I’ll cut your cigars when we either tour the outside, or we can stop at the smokeasy after the tour. What shall you decide?”

“Outside,” both men agreed.

“Perfect. So, to give you a little background, Elite San Antonio has been operational for less than a year, and we already have a membership of a little over 500. To some, that may not seem a lot. However, I think that only highlights the level of our exclusivity. The pricing of the memberships varies, of course, based on the level of services you utilize. We offer the Platinum, Gold, and Diamond packages, and they all come with their benefits, ranging from basic to supreme.”

“What comes in the supreme package?” Pierce interrupted.

“Whatever your heart desires,” Arianna purred, looking him dead in the eyes.

“So, you’re included in the Diamond package...good to know,” Pierce declared.

“I’m in a package that’s not offered to you yet.”

“When am I offered that package?” Pierce asked, subtly biting his bottom lip.

“When you’ve proven yourself worthy of it.”

Patrick cleared his throat before interrupting the banter between the two. The sexual tension between the two was so thick that he needed to turn on his high beams to navigate through it.

“Miss Carter, I would love to hear more about the Diamond package.”

“I agree,” Pierce piped up. “You know what they say...go big, or go home.”

“Yes, I’ve heard that. They also say, ‘walk it like you talk it.’” Patrick gave up. He felt if he continued clearing his throat, he would need a lozenge and some hot tea by the end of the tour.

“The best features of the Diamond Package, in my humble opinion, are the use of Elite SA’s private jet, our car service for special events, and a stay at one of our private villas located all over the world for a week.”

Patrick lowly whistled. He didn’t want to ask because you know what they say about asking. If you have to ask, then you can’t afford it.

“The fee is $500,000 a year for the Diamond Package.”

“That’s not a bad deal if you utilize the services. Take the jet a couple of times a year, and that vacation, the membership might actually pay for itself,” Patrick said with a smile.

“Absolutely, also keep in mind the jet may be shared between members, especially if you’re going to the same destination or somewhere nearby. Hopefully, you’ll get to know some of the other members here and build positive relationships. Socializing is one of the main factors for joining a country club. Am I right?”

“That, and then some,” Pierce answered, still hungrily eyeing Arianna.

“Right. We can discuss the packages later if you actually decide to sign up. Let’s get a move on.”",1,1752047435.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1lvcszp,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepThisInMind/comments/1lvcszp/how_do_you_clean_a_coffee_maker_without_vinegar/,How do you clean a coffee maker without vinegar?,"Here's what actually worked for my moldy coffee maker

So I messed up. I own a cheap 5-cup drip coffee maker that I’ve used daily for well over a year... and I never once cleaned it. I know. Huge mistake.

Last week I opened the water reservoir and noticed this dry, crusty buildup that looked suspiciously like mold mixed with hard water deposits. Gross. I tried the standard white vinegar and water trick (ran it through once, let it sit, ran it again). It helped a bit, but the gunk was still there, stuck to the sides and bottom.

Since I hate the vinegar smell and it didn’t even fully work, I looked for alternatives — and here’s what **actually cleaned it thoroughly**:

**1. Citric Acid Method (Highly Recommend)**

This was the real winner. Here's what I did:

* Boiled 3–4 cups of water  
* Stirred in 1 tablespoon of **food-grade citric acid powder**  
* Poured the solution into the reservoir and let it sit for **30 minutes**  
* Ran a full brew cycle  
* Then did **two rinse cycles** with plain water to flush it out  

**Results:** The crust softened up dramatically, and after the brew cycle I was able to reach in with a clean sponge and wipe out the remaining grime. No lingering odor, no harsh chemicals, no weird taste in the next batch of coffee.

# 2. Denture Tablets (Surprisingly Effective for Mild Buildup)

* Fill the reservoir with warm water  
* Drop in **1–2 denture tablets**  
* Let sit for 30–60 minutes, then run a brew cycle  
* Rinse with plain water  

They’re designed to dissolve biofilm and bacteria from dentures, so they’re safe and surprisingly effective for mineral buildup or light mold. But not quite strong enough for thick crusty messes.

# 3. Lemon Juice (if you’re in a pinch)

If you don’t have citric acid on hand, lemon juice works in a similar way:

* Mix ½ cup lemon juice with 1½ cups hot water  
* Let soak, then run a full brew cycle  
* Rinse twice with plain water  

Mild, effective for odor and light scaling. It’s not quite strong enough for years of gunk, but great for regular monthly maintenance.

# ❌ What Didn’t Work for Me

* **Vinegar** – Smelled awful and didn’t remove stubborn buildup  
* **Baking soda** – Tried it, but it didn’t dissolve the crust or reach inside pipes  
* **Scrubbing alone** – The reservoir has corners I couldn’t reach without a soak first  

# A Note on Mold vs. Limescale

That black “crust” may not actually be mold. If you live in a hard water area, it’s likely **mineral deposits** (limescale) — which is why acidic cleaners like citric acid or lemon juice work better than scrubbing or soap.

# Ongoing Maintenance Tip

Once your machine is clean:

* Do a citric acid clean **every 4–6 weeks**  
* Always use filtered water if possible  
* Leave the lid open to air dry between uses  

**Wrap Up** **Citric acid + hot water** worked 10x better than vinegar for my neglected coffee maker. No smell, no residue, and it handled even nasty crusty buildup. Highly recommend keeping some in your pantry if you hate vinegar like I do.

Anyone else have success with other hacks? I've heard people use CLR or vodka too, but not sure if that's safe for cheap plastic models.",1,1752046889.0,KeepThisInMind,0,1.0,False

At one point around 6 or 7pm yesterday my phone was heating up so I told my gf and her youngest brother (let’s just call him C for now) that I would be available to call in a bit I just wanted to let my phone cool off for a bit. 
I was texting my gf a bit later and she had told me that her and her other younger brother, who I’ll refer to as V ([M,15] I’m older by around half a year), had gotten into a fight and it was bad. 

I asked if she wanted to talk about it and she had told me that she was in the living room watching a show on the tv when V had came in wanting to use the Wii and just went to turn it on, completely ignoring that my gf was using the tv. 
She pointed it out and he said he didn’t care and wanted to use the Wii so he would. They went back and forth connecting the Wii/Tv until my gf got fed up and got up to take the controller from her brother. 
He didn’t want to hand it over and instead kicked her into their coffee table at their house. She got mad at him and tossed a plastic water bottle at him then disconnected the entire Wii from the tv. V got really mad at her and went to connect the Wii back in but then noticed she had the remote and was going to put her show back on. He went over to her and grabbed her, trying to get the remote from her.
She didn’t want to give it up and he started pulling her hair, punching her, kicking her, and choking her. My gf told me that she doesn’t know exactly how long it was but maybe about a minute later he let go of her but just to shove her onto the couch and choke her more.

C was there as well and was crying and yelling at V telling him to stop and to let her go. My gf was trying to yell at him to stop too but he was choking her. V got up to go hit C as well but my gf got between them so he couldn’t and he choked her more. She told me she wanted to get her phone to call someone but she didn’t know where it was and she was panicking. She said she couldn’t breathe and she even couldn’t move for a moment. 

C was able to find her phone and he called their mom which made V back off but all she did when she got home was tell him he shouldn’t hit women and if it happened again she would take his phone. 

My gf and I live about 3 hours away from each other and I can’t legally drive on my own yet so I couldn’t go get her or something. I don’t know what to do, if there is even anything I can do. This isn’t the first time V has put his hands on my gf and their mom never really does anything.

1lvcsdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1lvcsdw/4th_of_july_dilemma/,4th of July dilemma,"We had a family check in on the 4th of July. No issue at first, I was actually sitting in the dining room writing out a list of local fireworks for guests to go to if they wanted to since our town has it scheduled for later in the month. 
I had to run out real quick. 

We are a small town true B&B, the property operates on self serve unless it’s breakfast hours or actual issues like something broken, towel change, room service for wine, etc. All food places in our town offer plates and utensils to take out knowing it is a tourist spot and most hotels don’t offer plates. As long as someone is there we will assist if not and we have to run out, we let them know how soon we will back or offer to send someone (4th of July, unfortunately I would like for staff to enjoy the holiday) As I was sitting writing my list as mentioned and I greeted them. 

I left maybe like 20 minutes after my interaction to run out real quick, none of the guests were in the house and they must’ve came back while I was out. The first call comes in “we need ice” I inform them where the ice machine is and the cups for guest use, ice machine and cups are actually labeled in a spot they look directly at when they leave their room. “What about water?” Well, sir as stated in your email for your convenience all the water in the house is purified so you are able to use any water source in the house. “So tap water?” Yes, if that’s not okay we have bottled water for purchase in our gift shop. “I guess tap is fine” and I’m like okay well if you need anything else please let me know. 

On my way back I get a call again “we need plates” okay sir, I will be back in 10 minutes. “We need them now can we go in the kitchen?” No sir unfortunately as per policy and the sign on the kitchen door, for health and safety concerns our restaurant kitchen is not accessible to guests only staff. “Okay but we really can’t go into the kitchen?” No sir unfortunately I cannot allow you in there. “Okay fine we will wait” I ended up feeling bad and calling another staff member to see if they were willing to run by and assist them, to my luck they answered and were in the house within 3 minutes of the initial call on the phone with me as I was instructing them on where I put the clean items that were requested (it’s not normally their job to provide the items so they don’t know) they walked up the stairs and the wife stopped him while he was in the middle of asking where the items were and she said “Hi, do you work here? Can you assist us” and he replied with “yes I’m actually just receiving instruction on where everything was placed after cleaning please give me a moment” and then they asked him “we really can’t go into the kitchen?” He said no sorry but my manager called me asap to see if I was able to assist you though, please let me get the items.


They get their stuff and all seems fine. I come back and hang out until I need to turn off main lights around 10pm, see they are up there still and turn back around I’ll just leave the lights on. I come back around 11:30, no one is up there but art supplies are spread amongst tables, chairs are all pulled out, crumbs everywhere, open wine bottles, stale food on the table. Kicker, went in the kitchen to grab cleaning items from under sink and the plates they were given are all stacked on the counter. I clean it up go back to my own room (I’m onsite management) take pictures asking if we should charge and am told “we can’t we have no evidence they actually went into the kitchen” because the plates were stacked where someone could just lean over the swinging door. We also have a dirty dish bin out specifically for guest so stuff isn’t just left everywhere.


I’m off the next day but I always go touch base with staff to see if they need help. Before I go up there I get a text from other residents (elderly co-owners) saying they heard a large bang and are concerned something broke in the room above them. I tell them I can’t check until they leave. 

Breakfast is exactly at 9, staff normally arrives at 8:40 to start coffee. Staff is in kitchen doing dishes that were left from night prior to clear out the way and coffee is brewing. The guests have been in the dining room since 8am (notified by co-owner, his self proclaimed duty is laundry and he’s literally like almost 90 shouldn’t be working he loves his laundry.) he had offered helped to grab them stuff they said no and were using the self serve coffee machine in the hall. Staff proceeds to go out at 9 and get ready to start taking everyone’s orders in the house and nobody is down besides them and all their self bought breakfast from the grocery store sprawled across three tables. 

We have to ask them to move it as we have other guests coming down and need the tables along with public brunch guests coming in for reservations. 

They ordered breakfast, got up, once again left all our art supplies sprawled on the table. I finally am able to get up to their room and the toilet paper holder is knocked down and a whole roll of toilet paper is scattered across the bathroom floor. 

Proceeded to leave us a low review saying “4 staff members walking around but when you need help they aren’t there, breakfast not served EXACTLY at 9. Would not return.” 
Lowkey kinda sad third party sites don’t notify the guest they’ve been replied to. And the “report guest misconduct” button wasn’t popping up since their checkout. But also, bye.

1lvcs9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1lvcs9q/the_day_i_died_and_lived_again/,The Day I Died and Lived Again,"Ava Rodriguez clawed for breath, her ch\*\*t a suffocating vise.  
  
Her six-year-old, Leo, watched, his face pale with terror.  
  
Anaphylactic shock.  
  
Rapidly worsening.  
  
She choked out her husband Mark's name, begging him to call 911.  
  
""Mommy can't breathe!"" Leo cried into the phone.  
  
But Mark, busy ""networking"" with his mistress Chloe, dismissed it casually as a ""panic attack.""  
  
Minutes later, he called back: the ambulance he'd supposedly called for Ava was now diverted to Chloe, who had only ""tripped"" and twisted her ankle.  
  
Ava's world fractured.  
  
Leo, a hero in his small heart, raced out for help, only to be hit by a car.  
  
A sickening thud.  
  
She watched, a ghost in her own tragedy, as paramedics covered his small, broken body.  
  
Her son was gone, because Mark chose Chloe.  
  
Devastation.  
  
Horror.  
  
Guilt.  
  
The image of Leo haunted her, a searing brand.  
  
How could a father, a husband, be so monstrously selfish?  
  
A bitter, consuming regret clawed at her soul.  
  
Chloe. Always Chloe.  
  
Then, Ava's eyes snapped open.  
  
She was on her living room floor.  
  
Leo, alive and well, ran in.  
  
It was a terrifying, impossible second chance.  
  
That catastrophic future would not happen.  
  
She would reclaim her life, protect her son, and make them pay.  
  
  
Chapter 1  
Ava Rodriguez gasped for air. Her ch\*\*t tightened, a vise crushing her lungs.  
  
Leo, her six-year-old, watched, his small face pale with terror. ""Mommy?""  
  
She fumbled for her EpiPen, her vision blurring. Anaphylactic shock. Fast.  
  
""Call... Mark,"" she choked out. ""Nine... one... one.""  
  
Leo, bless his brave heart, grabbed her phone. His tiny fingers fumbled with the screen.  
  
He pressed the call button for Mark.  
  
""Daddy! Mommy can't breathe! She looks really bad!"" Leo cried into the phone.  
  
Mark's voice came through, distant, annoyed. ""She's probably just having a panic attack, Leo. Give her the EpiPen. I'm at a networking thing with Chloe. I'll be home soon.""  
  
""No, Daddy! It's serious! She said call 911!""  
  
""Okay, okay, I'll call an ambulance for her,"" Mark said, but his tone was dismissive.  
  
A few minutes later, as Ava drifted in a haze of pain, Mark called back. Leo put the phone to her ear.  
  
""Ava? Listen, Chloe tripped. Twisted her ankle real bad. The ambulance I called for you, I'm diverting it to her. She's closer, and she's in a lot of pain. You just use your EpiPen, you'll be fine.""  
  
Ava's world fractured. Chloe. Always Chloe.  
  
Leo, hearing this, screamed. ""No! Mommy needs help!"" He dropped the phone and bolted for the door, probably trying to get Mrs. Henderson next door.  
  
A horn blared. A sickening thud.  
  
Ava, through the fog, heard a different kind of scream, not Leo's.  
  
Then, silence.  
  
Her own breath hitched, a final, ragged g\*\*p. Her spirit felt like it was tearing away, floating above.  
  
She saw Leo. Lying on the street. Still.  
  
Paramedics were suddenly there, working on her, then rushing to Leo. Too late.  
  
The image burned into her soul: Leo, small and broken, because Mark chose Chloe.  
  
Devastation. A word too small. Horror. Grief. Guilt that she couldn't save him.  
  
Her heart, or what was left of it, shattered into a million pieces.  
  
She watched, a ghost in her own tragedy, as they covered Leo with a sheet.  
  
Mark. This was his fault. His neglect. His monstrous selfishness.  
  
Chloe. That woman.  
  
If she had another chance. If she could go back.  
  
She would never let Mark Thompson into her life. She would protect Leo.  
  
She would make them pay.  
  
The pain was absolute. A bitter, consuming regret.  
  
""Mark,"" her spirit whispered, a vow of cold fury, ""if there's a next life, I will never know you.""  
  
Ava's eyes snapped open.  
  
She was on her living room floor. Her ch\*\*t ached, but she could breathe.  
  
Her hands trembled. She touched her throat. No swelling.  
  
Leo.  
  
She scrambled up, her heart pounding. ""Leo!""  
  
He ran in from his room, eyes wide. ""Mommy? You okay? You were making funny noises.""  
  
She grabbed him, hugged him so tight he squeaked. Alive. He was alive.  
  
Her eyes, she knew, were probably bloodshot. Her hands still shook.  
  
The memory of the street, the thud, the sheet... it was too real.  
  
She looked at the calendar on the wall. Today's date. The same day.  
  
It hadn't happened yet.  
  
A miracle. A terrifying, second chance.  
  
Disorientation warred with a fierce, protective determination.  
  
She would not let that future happen.  
  
Her phone buzzed on the coffee table. A notification. Instagram.  
  
Chloe Davis.  
  
Ava's bl\*\*d ran cold. She picked it up, her finger hovering over the app.  
  
She had to know.  
  
Chloe's story: a lavish dinner. Mark, smiling beside her.  
  
And on Chloe's hand, a new, glittering ring. A ""promise ring.""  
  
The caption: ""Building a future with someone who truly sees my potential. So grateful for his support in launching my wellness brand! #NewBeginnings #SupportSystem.""  
  
The date stamp on the post: last night.  
  
Renewed pain. Anger. Disgust.  
  
He was already ""building a future"" with Chloe while married to her, while Leo was alive and well.  
  
How could he? How could any man be so devoid of basic decency?  
  
The key turned in the lock. Mark walked in, whistling.  
  
He stopped when he saw her face.  
  
""Hey, what's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost.""  
  
He smelled faintly of Chloe's cloying perfume. A smudge of lipstick, not her shade, was on his collar. He was always so careless.  
  
""You're overreacting,"" he'd always say. That was his favorite phrase. It grated on her nerves, a physical aversion.  
  
""Mark,"" Ava began, her voice tight. ""We need to talk.""  
  
""If I told you I almost died today, Mark, and Leo almost died, because you were with Chloe, what would you say?"" Ava asked, her voice dangerously calm.  
  
He frowned. ""What are you talking about? That's a crazy thing to say. Are you feeling okay?""  
  
She saw the blankness in his eyes. The utter lack of comprehension.  
  
He wouldn't get it. He would never get it.  
  
The weariness was a heavy cloak. The bitterness, a familiar taste.  
  
She had wasted years.  
  
""I want a divorce, Mark,"" she said, the words tasting like freedom.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
Mark stared at her, his charming smile faltering. ""A divorce? Ava, what's gotten into you?""  
  
Then, his expression shifted. He looked almost... relieved? No, calculating.  
  
""Actually, honey, I was going to talk to you about something similar.""  
  
He sat down, leaning forward conspiratorially.  
  
""Chloe's been having a rough time. Her brand launch... there are these online trolls, really vicious stuff. They're saying she's a homewrecker, that I'm neglecting my family for her.""  
  
Ava listened, a cold knot forming in her stomach. The absurdity of it.  
  
""So,"" Mark continued, ""I was thinking... what if we had a temporary separation? A quick, quiet divorce. Just on paper.""  
  
He rushed on, ""It would take the heat off Chloe. Show everyone I'm unattached. The trolls would back off. Then, once her brand is stable, we can, you know, get back together. It's just for show, Ava. To protect Chloe's career.""  
  
Ava looked at him. In her past life, the one that ended in horror, she might have cried, pleaded.  
  
Now, she felt a cold, hard resolve. He was offering her an out, gift-wrapped in his own selfishness.  
  
""Okay, Mark,"" she said.  
  
He blinked, surprised. ""Okay? Just like that?""  
  
""Yes. But I want a legally binding separation agreement. Fair division of assets. My stake in the house, and in your architectural firm. I helped fund that, remember?""  
  
His surprise turned to suspicion. ""Why are you being like this? So... petty? I thought you'd understand. It's just temporary.""  
  
""It's not petty, Mark. It's smart. If we're divorcing, even 'for show,' it needs to be done right.""  
  
Her calm unnerved him. This wasn't the Ava he knew.  
  
Mark, eager to get Chloe out of her ""trouble,"" pushed.  
  
""Alright, alright, a proper agreement. My lawyer can draw something up quickly. We can sign it tomorrow.""  
  
He even managed a semblance of an apology. ""I'm sorry it has to be like this, Ava. But it's for the best, you'll see. Chloe really needs this.""  
  
He truly believed his own lies. That this was a noble sacrifice he was making.  
  
Ava watched him, the man she once loved, now a stranger mouthing empty platitudes.  
  
""Mark,"" Ava said, her voice soft, a final test. ""Do you have any idea what this does to a family? To Leo?""  
  
She searched his face for a flicker of genuine concern, a hint of the man she married.  
  
There was nothing. Only impatience.  
  
She realized with a pang that any love she'd felt for him had died. It died with Leo in that other timeline, and it stayed dead now.  
  
Mark waved a dismissive hand. ""Don't be dramatic, Ava. It's a fake divorce. Leo doesn't even need to know the details. We'll still be a family. We'll get back together once this blows over. It's just a piece of paper.""  
  
His callousness was breathtaking. He truly didn't see the emotional devastation he was causing.  
  
The repetition of ""fake divorce"" and ""reunion"" was like a mantra he used to convince himself.  
  
The next day, they were in his lawyer's office.  
  
Ava read the agreement carefully. It was surprisingly fair, likely because Mark wanted this done quickly and without fuss from her.  
  
She picked up the pen. Her hand was steady.  
  
She signed her name. A definitive step.  
  
Mark let out a small, almost triumphant sigh. ""Good. That's settled then.""  
  
He couldn't hide his relief.  
  
""What about Leo?"" Ava asked, as they walked out. ""He has that robotics camp trial class this afternoon. You promised you'd take him.""  
  
Mark looked flustered. ""Oh, right. Uh, something came up with Chloe. Her niece, apparently, just moved to town and is really into robotics. Chloe asked if her niece could take Leo's trial spot. It's a huge favor to her sister, single mom, you know.""  
  
Ava stopped dead. ""You gave Leo's spot away? To Chloe's niece?""  
  
""It's just a trial class, Ava. He can go another time. Chloe's family is going through a lot.""  
  
Shock. Anger. Profound disappointment. He was already prioritizing Chloe's extended family over his own son.  
  
Ava felt a complete emotional detachment.  
  
This man, her husband, was a stranger. His actions were not just flawed; they were despicable.  
  
There was no ""them"" anymore. There was only her and Leo.  
  
And she would protect Leo.  
  
The trip to the courthouse was a blur of bitterness and irony.  
  
They stood before a judge, mumbled the required responses.  
  
It was so quick, so impersonal. So different from their wedding day, which had been full of hope and laughter.  
  
Mark was practically bouncing on the balls of his feet, eager to be done.  
  
The moment the judge declared them divorced, Mark's phone buzzed.  
  
He glanced at it, a wide smile spreading across his face.  
  
""Gotta go,"" he said, already turning away. ""Chloe needs me to help her pick out launch party venues. This is great, Ava. Perfect timing.""  
  
He didn't even look back.  
  
Ava stood there, alone, the divorce papers in her hand.  
  
A bitter amusement touched her lips. Perfect timing indeed. For him.  
  
She remembered their early days. The passion, the dreams they shared.  
  
When had it all gone so wrong?  
  
It started subtly. His increasing absorption in his work, or so she thought.  
  
Then Chloe re-entered his life, an old college acquaintance, her father having given Mark his first big break.  
  
Mark felt indebted. Chloe exploited that.  
  
The ""friendship"" grew. The late nights, the hushed phone calls.  
  
Ava had been blind, trusting.  
  
No more. There was no turning back. This second chance was a gift, and she wouldn't waste it.  
  
Ava walked to a pawn shop.  
  
She took off the diamond engagement ring Mark had given her. It had once symbolized their love.  
  
Now, it felt like a shackle.  
  
""How much for this?"" she asked the pawnbroker.  
  
He named a price. She took it without haggling.  
  
The irony wasn't lost on her. The ring he used to promise forever was now funding her escape from him.  
  
Back at the house – \*her\* house now, according to the agreement, until it was sold and proceeds split – she started packing.  
  
Not just her clothes, but Leo's too.  
  
She needed to get them away from Mark's toxic influence, away from Chloe's encroaching presence.  
  
A fresh start. Somewhere quiet.  
  
""Mommy?"" Leo came into her room, his lower lip trembling.  
  
He held up his tablet, his favorite robotics game on the screen.  
  
""The camp people emailed. They said my spot for the summer program... it's gone. Daddy gave it to someone named Lily. Chloe's niece.""  
  
His eyes filled with tears. ""But I wanted to go so bad.""  
  
Frustration. Concern. This was just the beginning of Mark's betrayals, even in this new timeline.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
Ava's phone slipped from her hand, clattering onto the hardwood floor.  
  
The sound echoed the shattering of her composure.  
  
""He what?""  
  
Leo's robotics camp. She'd spent months researching it, filling out applications, hyping Leo up.  
  
He'd been ecstatic when he got in, dreaming of building robots.  
  
It wasn't just a camp; it was his passion.  
  
She had agreed to Mark's sham divorce, signed the papers, all to supposedly ""protect"" Chloe.  
  
And this was how he repaid her? By snatching away something precious to their son?  
  
The unfairness of it burned.  
  
Why did he keep doing this? Did he think her compliance meant she'd tolerate anything?  
  
Leo started to cry, fat tears rolling down his cheeks. ""I really wanted to build a robot, Mommy.""  
  
Ava knelt and pulled him into a hug. ""I know, sweetie. I know.""  
  
Her heart ached for him.  
  
She tried calling Mark. Straight to voicemail. Again and again.  
  
He was ignoring her. Deliberately.  
  
A few hours later, Chloe's Instagram lit up.  
  
A picture of her, beaming, with a young girl Ava presumed was the niece, Lily.  
  
They were at the robotics camp orientation.  
  
Chloe's caption: ""So proud of my brilliant niece Lily, acing her robotics camp orientation! Future innovator right here! Thanks to some generous friends for making this happen. #FamilyFirst #STEMgirl.""  
  
Comments flooded in: ""You're such a great aunt, Chloe!"" ""So sweet!""  
  
Humiliation washed over Ava. Anger. Injustice.  
  
Leo was at home crying, and Chloe was publicly celebrating his stolen opportunity.  
  
Ava grabbed her keys. ""Come on, Leo. We're going to that camp.""  
  
Determination hardened her face.  
  
They drove to the community center hosting the camp.  
  
Mark's car was in the parking lot.  
  
They found him near the entrance, laughing with Chloe and Lily.  
  
""Mark!"" Ava's voice was sharp.  
  
He turned, his smile fading when he saw her and Leo.  
  
""Ava? What are you doing here? You're making a scene."" His tone was annoyed.  
  
Leo, emboldened by Ava's presence, stepped forward.  
  
""That's my spot, Daddy! I got in first!""  
  
His small voice trembled but held a note of defiance.  
  
Mark crouched down, his voice syrupy sweet, the kind he used when he was being most manipulative.  
  
""Leo, buddy, Lily's mom is having a really tough time. She's a single mom. And Lily really, really wanted this. You're a generous boy, right? Can't you let Lily have this chance? Be a good big brother figure.""  
  
Unfair. So unfair. He was asking Leo to sacrifice his dreams for a stranger.  
  
""No!"" Leo said, stomping his foot. ""It's my camp!""  
  
He was rarely defiant. This meant the world to him.  
  
Mark's face hardened. The gentle facade vanished.  
  
""Leo Thompson, that's enough! Don't be selfish. Your mother needs to teach you better manners instead of filling your head with pettiness.""  
  
He glared at Ava. ""This is your fault.""  
  
Leo burst into tears, loud, heartbroken sobs.  
  
Ava pulled him close, shielding him.  
  
She felt a rage so intense it was a physical pressure in her ch\*\*t.  
  
But she remembered her past life, her explosive anger that solved nothing.  
  
She took a deep breath, pushed it down.  
  
""Mark,"" she said, her voice surprisingly steady, ""please. Give Leo back his spot. It means so much to him. I'm... I'm begging you. This is the first time I've ever begged you for anything.""  
  
Mark looked away, a flicker of something – guilt? – in his eyes.  
  
It vanished as quickly as it came.  
  
""It's too late, the spot is filled,"" he mumbled, then seemed to think better of it. ""Look, I'll buy Leo that new Star Warrior Lego set he wanted. That's even cooler, right?""  
  
He didn't understand. He would never understand.  
  
A material toy for a shattered dream.  
  
Ava felt a deep, profound despair.  
  
He would always prioritize Chloe. Always. Her family, her whims, her needs.  
  
Ava and Leo would always be secondary.  
  
""Disappointment to the core"" didn't even begin to cover it.  
  
Ava tried to push past Mark, to talk to the camp director. Maybe there was a mistake, a waiting list.  
  
""Excuse me,"" she said, trying to reach the registration table.  
  
Mark grabbed her arm, his grip surprisingly strong.  
  
Two of his architect firm's junior employees, who seemed to be there with him, moved to flank him, looking uncomfortable but obedient.  
  
""Ava, don't cause a scene,"" Mark hissed. ""You're embarrassing yourself. And Leo.""  
  
""Let go of me, Mark!"" Ava shouted, trying to pull free. ""Leo earned that spot!""  
  
She stumbled, nearly falling. Her voice cracked with unheard anguish.  
  
The camp director looked over, concerned, but Mark waved dismissively.  
  
Mark watched her, his jaw tight.  
  
He was probably thinking of Chloe's father, the ""debt"" he owed.  
  
This ""sacrifice"" of Leo's happiness was, in his twisted mind, part of repaying that debt.  
  
Protecting Chloe, even at his own son's expense.  
  
The junior architects gently but firmly escorted Ava and a sobbing Leo towards the exit.  
  
Ava, defeated, stopped by the registration table on her way out.  
  
""My son, Leo Rodriguez-Thompson, he was accepted...""  
  
The camp coordinator, a kind-faced woman, gave her a sympathetic look. ""I'm so sorry, Ms. Rodriguez. Mr. Thompson called this morning. He said Leo was no longer able to attend and offered the spot to his... associate's niece. All the spots are filled now.""  
  
Polite. Final. Irreversible.  
  
As Ava led a heartbroken Leo away, Chloe approached them, a smug smile on her face.  
  
""Ava, thank you so much for understanding. Leo is such a sweet boy to let Lily have this. It means the world to her.""  
  
Her voice dripped with false gratitude. She was taunting her.  
  
Mark walked up beside Chloe, putting an arm around her.  
  
""See, Ava? Chloe is grateful. You should try to be more like her. More accommodating.""  
  
His words were another betrayal, another twist of the knife.  
  
Ava felt a sharp pain in her ch\*\*t, her breath catching.  
  
The injustice, the blatant manipulation, it was suffocating.  
  
She just wanted to get Leo out of there.  
  
Mark wasn't done. ""You're always making things difficult, Ava. Just like you always have. If you were just a little more understanding, none of this would be necessary.""  
  
The same old accusations. The same blame-shifting.  
  
It was always her fault, in his eyes.  
  
  
Chapter 4  
Ava remembered all the times Mark had used Leo to keep her in line.  
  
""Think of Leo, Ava.""  
  
""Do you want Leo to grow up in a broken home?""  
  
""A good mother would sacrifice for her child's stability.""  
  
She had believed him. For too long.  
  
She had sacrificed her own happiness, her own well-being, for that illusion of stability.  
  
Regret was a bitter pill.  
  
No more. This second chance, this impossible return, she wouldn't waste it.  
  
She would leave. She would take Leo and build a life where he was cherished, not used as a pawn.  
  
Her resolve was firm. A sense of relief, sharp and clean, cut through the pain.  
  
Leo, despite his own tears, reached up and patted her cheek.  
  
""It's okay, Mommy. Don't be sad. We can build robots at home.""  
  
His small hand, his attempt to comfort her.  
  
Tenderness welled up, mixed with a fresh wave of guilt. He shouldn't have to be this strong.  
  
Ava knelt and hugged him fiercely, tears finally escaping her.  
  
""Oh, Leo. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I should have protected you better.""  
  
She wasn't just apologizing for the camp, but for all the hurt Mark had inflicted, all the hurt she had allowed.  
  
Leo hugged her back, his small arms tight around her neck.  
  
""I love you, Mommy. You're the best mommy.""  
  
His pure, unconditional love was a balm to her wounded soul.  
  
It was all the comfort she needed.  
  
A few days later, a moving van pulled up to the house.  
  
Chloe and her daughter, Maya (not Lily, Ava noted the name change, another layer of Chloe's casual deceit), began unloading boxes.  
  
Chloe sauntered in, a triumphant smirk on her face.  
  
""Well, hello there, Ava. Don't mind us. Just moving into the guest room. And Maya will take Leo's old playroom. Mark insisted.""  
  
Invasion. Discomfort.  
  
Chloe walked right up to Ava, hands on her hips.  
  
""Got a problem with that, Ava? Mark said it was fine. We're all one big happy... situation, right?""  
  
Her tone was a challenge, daring Ava to react.  
  
Ava looked at her, then at the boxes, then back at Chloe's smug face.  
  
She felt a profound weariness.  
  
""No problem at all, Chloe,"" Ava said, her voice flat, indifferent.  
  
Let her have her small victory. It wouldn't last.  
  
Mark rushed in, predictably, to Chloe's side.  
  
""Ava, don't start. Chloe and Maya need a place to stay. Their apartment has 'black mold,' it's a disaster."" He physically shielded Chloe.  
  
""You know this is all because you insisted on that ridiculous divorce. If you hadn't, we wouldn't be in this mess.""  
  
The same old blame.  
  
Ava just nodded. ""You're right, Mark. My fault.""  
  
She was too tired to argue. Too focused on her escape plan.  
  
Mark, puffing up with his perceived authority, gestured around.  
  
""Alright. Chloe, you and Maya can take the master suite. It's bigger. Ava, you and Leo can move into the guest room downstairs. And Leo's playroom will be Maya's new room.""  
  
Dispossession. Injustice. He was giving away her space, their son's space, to these interlopers.  
  
Ava shrugged. ""Fine.""  
  
Peace, for now, was more important than fighting over rooms she was about to leave anyway.  
  
She wanted to scream, to pack her bags and Leo's and walk out that very second.  
  
But Leo had a slight fever, a summer cold. She couldn't drag him to a hotel like this.  
  
Soon. Very soon.  
  
Leo looked around his playroom, now filled with unfamiliar pink and purple boxes.  
  
""Mommy, why is Maya taking my room? This is our house.""  
  
His confusion was heartbreaking.  
  
Ava knelt beside him, her voice gentle.  
  
""Sweetheart, sometimes things change. For now, we're like... guests in this part of the house. But we'll have our own special place soon, just you and me.""  
  
A sad, metaphorical explanation.  
  
Later that evening, there was a knock on the guest room door. Mark.  
  
Ava felt a wave of annoyance.  
  
She opened it a crack. ""What do you want, Mark?""

A young woman noticed him from across the room—he wasn’t doing anything special, just watching the raindrops race down the window.

Out of curiosity, she asked, “Do you always come here alone?”

He smiled. “Not always. But today, I wanted to think. Life moves too fast, don’t you think? One day you’re chasing dreams, and the next, you’re wondering if you lived them.”

She sat down, unsure if she should stay or walk away, but his calm presence felt like something she needed. They didn’t talk much after that—just silence, rain, and the occasional clink of a spoon against a cup.

Before she left, the old man said, “When you’re older, you’ll realize the quietest days teach you the loudest lessons.”

She never forgot those words.

I wanted to share a bit of background about our business journey. Back in 2023, we were looking to start a side gig alongside our day jobs and eventually decided to venture into vending machines in public spaces. We began with a single machine, fully funded by ourselves, and it performed really well. Within six months, we received a lot of inquiries from both individuals and large corporates, which led us to start offering franchise setups in 2024. By the end of 2023, we registered our company as a private limited entity, with four friends as partners.   

  


Fast forward to today: we now operate around 100 machines across Kerala, both owned by us and operated by approximately 25 franchisees. Our audit for the last financial year showed a turnover of ₹1.5 crore, all achieved without any external investors. We also obtained an import license to source customized machines from China, and our first container of machines arrived this February. The machines sold out within a few weeks, and we’re now planning to import more—including coffee vending machines (with hot/cold and ice cube options), ice cream machines, hot food vending machines, outdoor machines, and larger-capacity regular machines.  


So far, we’ve been completely bootstrapped. I’d love to hear your thoughts and suggestions on how to attract investors and scale the business further.  


Thank you for reading!

To put it into perspective, I’d rate the quality several notches below McDonald’s coffee, which I actually enjoy.

Hey r/IndiaCoffee!

Has anyone here tried **Curious Life Roasters** (Jaipur-based)? I came across their site while browsing for Indian roasters who focus on espresso blends, and their packaging/branding looks solid.

I’m especially interested in their **BISON blend** — they describe it as a house espresso blend with chocolate/nutty notes.

If you’ve tried:

* **How’s the flavour balance?**
* Does it hold up in milk-based drinks like lattes/cappuccinos?
* Any issues with freshness, shipping, or roast consistency?
* How does it compare with something like Blue Tokai or KC Roasters?

Would love an honest take, especially from people using **home espresso setups** (I’m on a Havells Corretto).

Also open to general recs from Curious Life if there’s anything else that blew you away.

This breakup needed to happen a long time ago. Saturday night was rough, Sunday morning I called the police. Abuse charge filed, he got a misdemeanor and spent a few days in jail before bail. He admitted to everything, didn’t ask for an attorney. He’s been given a DANCO (Domestic Abuse No Contact Order) and will be subjected to random urine testing for drugs and alcohol. 
This is for the best and I know it. I know that. He’s going to heal and get better, and I’m not going to be there to see it. That’s what needs to happen, and I am happy he’s getting the help he needs and is willing to take those steps and let friends and family help him. 
I haven’t been able to eat since Saturday. I just can’t. Friends have brought me food. It’s there, it’s in my fridge. I have easy snacks like jello. I have cans of soda that I enjoy. I can’t eat them. I could make eggs and toast, I don’t. I could make a sandwich, I can’t. 
I made a cup of coffee yesterday because my dad came by, but drinking it made me feel physically ill. 
The thought of making food and not being able to offer it to him is too difficult to get past right now. 
I know why it’s happening, I’m in therapy and I’m more aware of myself now than I ever have been. I allowed myself to become dependent on a man who abused me, to walk on eggshells around him and anticipate his needs. It’s a survival mechanism from my childhood. I know why I feel like I can’t eat without him. The fact is that I can’t eat, even though I’m aware of why and the irrationality of it. 
I just.. idk. I wish he was here. I wish I could make us breakfast in the morning. I wish I could offer him coffee when I make my own, and have him say no because he doesn’t like it that much. I miss cooking with him. We’ve cooked some amazing things together. 
I don’t want to eat alone. I don’t want to eat at all. I know that I have to, but every time I go in to the kitchen and take something out of the fridge I end up just staring at it blankly like I don’t know what to do. Then I put it back and crawl back in to bed.

1lvcgkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoreyWayne/comments/1lvcgkm/how_to_pull_back_gently_when_she_reaches_out_all/,How to pull back gently when she reaches out all the time?,"TLDR; I want to pull back a bit from my GF since I feel that her attraction is dipping a bit, nothing crazy, but still. My situation is similar to what's outlined in ""The Art of Letting Women Earn Your Attention in Long-term Relationships"" - https://youtu.be/KaY83pY-TPw?si=FwumsHPHalDAASGd

Full context:
I see my girl almost daily, she has a high level of attraction and reaches out all the time (100% even), but I can feel her enthusiasm for sex is dipping. She told me herself actually - she also thinks she's having some libido issues, but I think my over-availability is causing her to be too comfy and maybe not appreciate me as much. Plus, having her around all the time is affecting my routine a bit and it's making me overlook other things in my life. Don't get me wrong, she's still all over me, sweet and loving, but I feel like things could be improved.

My plan is to pull back because, also, I want more time for myself. We go to salsa together Mon and Thurs (that's where we met), but she started joining me in the gym every now and then, too, which is nice, but I just want to carve out a bit of my own space.

The question is how to pull back without making myself seem disinterested. Like Corey says, when women reach out, they want to feel your love and presence and see you hence why you set dates. If you don't set a date or, worse, you say you're busy, they'll think you're not into them. So, how do I approach this? I usually set a date when she reaches out so she may be used to that.

For example, this morning she messaged me saying:
""Hellooooo :) are you going to the gym this morning? 😊""
Me: ""Good morning 😘 yes, but I'm going with my brother to XYZ"" (I stayed the night over at his place, it's way easier like that but I wasn't going to start explaining myself)
Her: ""Ah, okay :) enjoyyy""
Me: ""Thanks, have fun, too, sweetie :)""

I'm seeing her tomorrow evening at our salsa class anyway and on Saturday for a friend's wedding, plus she invited me go and look for new coffee with her Sunday afternoon although we haven't ironed out the details on that one. Thursday and Friday evening I've also got MMA till 10.30pm. I started going to her place after MMA if she reaches out, but I think some time away will do us good. I'm planning to just iron out the plans for Saturday and leave it at that, but should I just not bring up the topic of getting together if she reaches out or say something like ""I want to see you, but my schedule is hectic right now"" (it seems like the wrong way to go since she'll think I don't want to see her).

**Chizuru and Kazuya settled into a cozy restaurant near the hospital for lunch, sunlight streaming through the window, casting a warm glow over their table. Both carried a mix of excitement and nervous anticipation after the morning’s hospital visit. After the meal, Chizuru was due to head to the convenience store for her manager shift, while Kazuya had his part-time job to attend.**

Kazuya (with concern): “You should go home and rest. Skip the manager shift this afternoon—the doctor said to avoid overexertion.”

Chizuru (smiling, shaking her head firmly): “I posted on Instagram promising the fans I’d be there. I can’t let them down! I’ll be careful, don’t worry.”

Kazuya (frowning, insistent): “Then let me take the day off to stay with you.”

Chizuru (playfully scolding): “Absolutely not! You need to be a responsible dad and earn money for our family. You can’t stick by my side every day!”

Kazuya (sighing reluctantly): “Fine… but we should tell Grandma and our parents so they don’t let you do any heavy work.”

Chizuru (giggling): “Heavy work? I’m usually just at the counter, ringing up customers, chatting, or taking selfies with fans. The heavy lifting—like moving stock—is all handled by the exchange student .”

Kazuya (pouting, a hint of jealousy): “You mean that exchange student who took over my room?”

Chizuru (laughing, teasing): “Don’t be like that! You should thank him. If it wasn’t for him, would you have had an excuse to crash at my place for over a month?”

Kazuya (scratching his head, chuckling): “Fair point. I guess I owe him one. Didn’t he go back to the Philippines, though?”

Chizuru (nodding): “Yeah, but Dad’s often at the store, and Grandma’s there when I’m on shift. They take good care of me.”

Kazuya (seriously): “Alright, but we need to tell them soon. Let’s do it tonight.”

Chizuru (nervously): “Okay… but won’t this cause them trouble? Will they scold us?”

Kazuya (taking her hand, reassuring): “Don’t worry. They’d never scold you—they’ll just love you more.”

Chizuru (hesitant, glancing at him): “But… will they give you a hard time?”

Kazuya (grinning casually): “That’s inevitable, but I’m ready for it.”

Chizuru (softly, with a touch of guilt): “Sometimes I wonder if my presence has taken away some of their love for you. They’re so kind to me, but they seem… stricter with you.”

Kazuya (gazing at her warmly): “Don’t say that. You’re my treasure, so of course they treat you like one too. And now, with our little treasure in your belly, they’ll spoil you even more.”

Chizuru (pouting): “But Grandma always seems disappointed in you, picking on you, never gentle.”

Kazuya (shaking his head, reflective): “Don’t misunderstand—Grandma loves me dearly. I just haven’t lived up to her expectations. When I was a kid, I did well—top of my class, even won the kids’ kendama championship. Grandma used to praise me, buy me toys. But as I grew up, everything seemed too easy, and I lost my drive. School, hobbies—I got sloppy. I know Grandma had high hopes, and I let her down, so she’s gotten stricter.”

Chizuru (squeezing his hand, encouraging): “I believe things will get better. You’ve found your purpose now, haven’t you?”

Kazuya (eyes shining with resolve): “Absolutely. And now I have another—to make sure our child grows up happy.”

Chizuru (sighing, apologetic): “Still, we haven’t even graduated yet. Having a baby now will burden our families. I feel so guilty.”

Kazuya (smiling reassuringly): “Don’t think like that. We’re family! Even if I get an earful, they’ll be thrilled to welcome the new life.”

Chizuru (glancing at the time): “Alright, I’ve got to head to the store.”

Kazuya (standing up): “I’ve got a bit of time. Let me walk you there.”

**Hand in hand, they left the restaurant, their steps light but hearts heavy with both trepidation and hope for the future.**

**Around 2:30 p.m., the convenience store was relatively quiet. Chizuru was in the dining area, chatting with customers—an elderly lady accompanied by her three- or four-year-old granddaughter. The little girl, clutching a storybook, begged Chizuru to read to her. Chizuru gently lifted her onto a barstool in the dining area and began telling the story with a warm smile. The elderly lady, meanwhile, slipped into the office next to the dining area to chat with Grandma Nagomi.**

Elderly lady (smiling): “Is this your future granddaughter-in-law? She’s not just beautiful but so gentle! Kazuya hit the jackpot.”

Grandma Nagomi (beaming with pride): “Haha, of course! Kazuya’s blessed beyond measure to have her.”

Elderly lady (nodding): “She’s so patient with my naughty little granddaughter. She’ll make a wonderful mother someday.”

**At that moment, Umi, his heart pounding with nervous anticipation, arrived at the convenience store. The “Store Manager Chizuru” cardboard cutout at the entrance greeted him with a welcoming smile. Taking a deep breath, he pushed open the door, his eyes scanning for Chizuru. Spotting her in the dining area, engrossed in storytelling, he approached quietly. Only when he was close did she notice him, and he greeted her softly.**

Umi (tentatively): “Hey, Chizuru-chan.”

Chizuru (startled, eyes widening): “Oh, hi. Did you see my cutout outside and decide to drop by?”

**For reasons unknown, as Umi drew closer, the little girl burst into tears, startling Chizuru, who quickly tried to soothe her.**

Chizuru (anxiously): “What’s wrong? Why are you crying all of a sudden?”

Little Girl (pointing at Umi, panicked): “Baby… waa… scary baby… waa…”

**The elderly lady, seeing her granddaughter’s distress, rushed over to scoop her up. Grandma Nagomi joined them, concerned.**

Grandma Nagomi (soothingly): “Sweetie, what’s wrong? Why are you crying?”

Little Girl (sobbing, frantic): “Uncle… waa… shoulder… scary baby…”

**Grandma Nagomi frowned, puzzled by the girl’s words. The elderly lady chimed in,** 

“My little one often cries for no reason, saying she sees things we can’t. I think she’s just being playful.”

**With the girl taken away, the interruption resolved, Umi exhaled in relief and turned to Chizuru.**

So, I have a job (yay) in a field i always wanted to pursue (double yay). It's a hybrid job - 1 day on site, 4 days from home. And everything would be okay, but my anxiety is making me feel unwell. 

Like, the first day at work in the office, when i stepped into the room full of coworkers I wanted to run away - understandable, new people everywhere, new situation, etc etc. But I survived the first day and it wasn't so bad. 

Then the next day I had a scheduled online meeting with a team leader. That day I woke up earlier than usual with stomachache, then drank coffee as i usually do, but i couldn't even finish it because i felt like i was gonna throw up. The entire day was like it, i barely ate anything. Then in the evening it turns out my team leader had no time for a meeting, so we had to meet the next day. IMMEDIATELY i felt better, got more lively, aches and nausea went away... The next day - same thing until I met with my TL - then everything went away...

I've read something about how coffee can amplify the anxiety, so i tried not drinking it, but it didn't help. Also brushing teeth in the morning is nearly impossible, because one wrong move with a toothbrush and i'm gagging. Breathing exercises don't necessarily work for me, maybe only for a slight moment.

I have no idea what stresses me so much about it and have no idea what can i do... I had a summer job a year or two ago, I was attending university - none of those things made me feel that bad.

There was no big fight, we talked, and she thought that it was unfair that she should fight for the relationship / she was not willing to commit and could only see the mistakes that i had done :/ i wont go into super much detail, bc then i could write a whole essay about it 😅 i would say that she have been quite the avoidant type of person. 

But here i am 3 weeks later, actually doing pretty good, i still have my bad and good days, but there are more of the good days than there are bad days. Yesterday i was sitting with some friends in my backyard, just chilling and drinking some beers, when i got a message from her. She wrote

 "" Would you like to come and see the new apartment one day? I'm getting settled in and would love it if you could come over for a cup of coffee❤️""

i replied with 

""Hey, it's great that you've settled in well, in your new apartment and that you want to share it with me. However, I don't think I'm at a place yet where I think it's a good idea to meet up and therefore I think we should take it easy""

Ofc my heart began to beat a little faster, when her messsage popped up, but i thought to myself, what good will this do me, i will only get more hurt, because we are only 3 weeks post breakup.

Was this the right thing to say/do ?

There's always been a reason not to.  Time, fear, doubt...they've all played an equal part in my decision to push the idea to the back of my mind. 
I'm now about to be 40 years old, and I just can't hold back any longer. 
But, where do I start?  The beginning, well that would just be expected, and (if I'm being honest here) who the Hell can remember all the details in chronological order?!?

So, I'll start from now.  
I (40F) write from the ""comfort"" of my bed.  Another day has gone.  I've spent my time focused on the wants and needs of everyone around me, and now I have but just a moment to think of myself. 

How did I get here?  Lost in the world of everyone else.  Invisible to all, even those who see me every day. 
Married to man (40) who's infidelity has crumbled every part of my soul, I struggle to find myself in a sea of demands.  For I am responsible for making this family work.  

Determined to give my children a family home to grow up in, I've stayed through the dishonesty, insults, and pain.  I've buried my own unhappiness to prevent theirs.  Because while he's a bad husband, he's an amazing father.

Still, I lay here, forgotten.

Twenty years we've been married.  Twenty years of birthdays overlooked.  Twenty years of anniversaries focused on him.  Twenty years of loving someone but never being loved back the same way. 

I wake each morning, make him coffee, lunch, and send him to work. I then work 8-10 hours at my own job while handling anything the kids need as well.  In the evenings we make dinner and are intimate almost daily.  I focus on his desires and  tend to him making sure he's satisfied. 

Still, I lay here, empty. 

Is it wrong to dream of one day meeting a man that asks me what it is I want, and actually listen to my response? To meet a man that pays just as much attention to me as I do him? Who would know my favorite color, activities I enjoy, and who can stimulate me not only physically but mentally as well? 

I'm sure plenty of people feel it is wrong of me, but I am just human.  I too want to be seen, heard, loved. I want to be desired. 

Still, I lay here surrounded and alone.

TLDR-

I (25M) moved to a new city abroad and became close friends with a girl (25F) from my department who's also from my country. We spend a lot of time together - lunch, coffee, groceries, emotional talks - and she's the only person I've truly connected with here. Over time, I developed feelings for her. The problem is, she's in a long-distance relationship (which she rarely mentions), and I'm scared that confessing could ruin the only real friendship I have here. I don't know if I'm in love, just emotionally dependent, or what I should do next. It's getting heavier to keep it all inside. Looking for advice.

So long post,

I moved to a new city (we both are from the same country, but live in a foreign country). When I first moved, I had no friends for nearly a month, well, I'm not a social, outgoing person - zero social interaction. Then I met this girl in my department who's from the same country as me. She was warm, friendly, and later introduced me to a bunch of other people, too. But honestly, she's the only one I've truly connected with - the others feel more like acquaintances.

Since we're in the same department, we naturally started spending more time together. Now it's become part of our routine - we have lunch together every day, go for coffee, go back home together, and do groceries together. Just kind of like close friends, on the surface.

But lately... things are feeling a lot more intense - at least for me. The long eye contacts, the emotional comfort I feel when I'm around her - it's been growing. She often shares personal things with me - like her overthinking, her past, her anxiety. And I listen. I genuinely care. I've noticed she remembers tiny details about me, too - even random things I mentioned once. I can be emotionally open with her in a way I'm not even with my oldest friends.

Now the twist is that she is in a very old, long-distance relationship, but she never mentions it in front of me, and this feeling that is growing inside me is killing me from the inside because she's the only friend I have here, confessing things directly can either go good way or I lose the only friend I have, and that's what scares me the most. I don't know how to proceed from this. Every day, I can't stop thinking about her, and now it's getting heavier on me to keep it just with me, Can you suggest what's best thing I should do?",3,1752044651.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

I dreamed of being pulled out of my body after telling the person I was talking to that I was ready to go if I died in my sleep, then I kicked myself back awake.

I was watching a video of someone describing her nightmare and remembered the scariest one I've ever had. I tend to dream vividly, but actively forget about them if they bother me to the point of making me dysfunctional. I wanted to post it here to know objective thoughts. Being in a culture that puts heavy emphasis on superstition and the subconscious, I never really believed in dream interpretation, but this one still makes my heart race when I think about it.

It happened 2 years ago at 2am. I had a day job and do art freelancing on the side to keep my passion flowing. Unfortunately, the deadlines just wanted to make a living shell out of me. Some significant progress and a concerning amount of The Editors later, I decided to take a break from painting to rest my eyes. I turned the lights off, set an alarm for 30 minutes, then put a gel eye mask on for relief. I usually just lay there in silence to destress my senses, but 20 minutes in, I started to fall asleep.

Now, I used to be a lucid dreamer and was notorious for purposefully initiating sleep paralysis. My first was a few days after my uncle died. We had his funeral in our living room (cultural norm) while we slept upstairs. I went to bed after entertaining the guests. As soon as I set my head on my pillow, I felt like my body was numb dead. All my senses were hyperactive, but I couldn't lift an eyelid as I visioned my lightless room with intense clarity.

An eerie voice that sounded like my late uncle whispered my name directly in my ear. My chest felt heavy, so as the atmosphere closed in like a thin soft mesh, I was a getting more scared. The lack of control probably yanked me into survival mode, and I remembered my dad always said to kick your feet when you lose sensation. He said it helped your brain warm up on simple tasks before you process complex actions or emotions, like happiness or grief. So, focusing like how Uma Thurman wiggled for 13 hours, I jerked back awake. Since then, I've pretty much mastered how to maneuver sleep paralysis until a decade ago.

I forgot how the nightmare started, but in it, I was talking to someone. I've grazed every wrinkle of my brain to recall who it was, because they were familiar, but unknown. I ultimately resigned, thinking they were expendable, though important enough for us to meet in a white café space. I couldn't tell you the time of day, the people around, nor which of us is which as there was no dimension whatsoever. The coffee tables and chairs have black finishes, and the sterile fluorescent lighting evoked a true neutral. We talked, eventually got into the conversation of death, and apparently, me dying. I still struggle with how I feel about passing, but in the dream, I told them, ""If this is how l'm gonna go (asleep), I'Il go.""

Immediately after I said that, I felt someone grab me from the back and pull my soul upward. It was so fast that in a split-second, I was at the ceiling around 2.5m tall, about to phase through. I saw my room, dark and blurry, but I didn't see my body. I screamed ""NO!!!"" with all I had. Maybe it was because when I was being dragged out of the face of the earth, I started to regret not believing in a higher power. Or because I didn't want to go when I had so much left I wanted to live for. Or that I didn't live well enough to not be a faceless catalyst in someone else's dream. Either way, it triggered my muscle memory so instinctively that I jolted my right foot. Like a rubber band, I snapped my soul back into my body.

When I was awake, I felt so empty. So light. Like my body didn't have organs, just air. I didn't get up from bed. I didn't want to. I wasn't paralyzed, I felt content. My alarm went off, but I decided not to remove my eye mask and just float adrift. You'd think you would want to get up and never sleep again, but I just wanted to stay still and feel no responsibility.

It was only after a couple of days when I felt the anxiety of it all crashing in. I talked to my partner, my friends, and anyone who would listen, about how I honestly felt like in that moment, if I didn't wiggle my little piggies, I would've died. I got everything from a psychological review to a spiritual response. Nothing ever hit the mark, and, sadly, it didn't fix my uncertainty about death and other insecurities. I finished the painting I was doing within the week, but I still don't know what that night meant. Was it ego death? Was it astral projection? Was I actually dying and did happy feet really save my life? Maybe someone can help me interpret things. Thank you in advance.

1lvc5xd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/1lvc5xd/some_witchy_tips_for_everyday_life/,Some witchy tips for everyday life,"Here's some witchy tips to follow in your daily life, stay whimsical. Some of these are VERY common, some a little unheard of. I'm just listing everything out here. 


1. Morning Intention with Water
As you brush your teeth or wash your face in the morning, take a moment to run your hands under cool water and speak your intention for the day. Whisper it if you like: ""Clarity and strength come to me today."" Visualize any heaviness being washed away. Water holds memory and responds to energy, so infuse it with purpose. Even just standing still for a breath while water runs can become a form of grounding.

2. Stirring Spells with Your Drinks
When making tea, coffee, or any morning drink, stir with intention. Clockwise for calling things in — confidence, abundance, love. Counterclockwise for banishing — anxiety, fatigue, tension. As you stir, say what you seek or want to release, quietly or in your head. A simple thought like ""Focus and energy"" or ""No stress today"" imbues your drink with that energy. This becomes especially powerful if you bless the ingredients beforehand with gratitude.

3. Carry a Pocket Charm or Crystal
Choose a small stone, charm, or natural object — like a smooth piece of rose quartz, a tiny shell, or a coin you've blessed under moonlight. Keep it in your pocket or bag. Every time you touch it, take a breath and recall its meaning. Let it be a small reminder of your intention or your protection. Over time, it becomes a little battery of energy charged by your presence.

4. Smoke Clearing Your Space (Even with Incense or a Match)
Light incense, a bay leaf, or even just a match, and waft the smoke gently in corners of your room. As the smoke curls upward, picture stagnant energy rising and dissipating. Say something like ""Only clarity and peace remain."" Even without elaborate rituals, this clears energy and refocuses the atmosphere. This can also be done after difficult conversations or when you feel emotionally cluttered.

5. Moonlight Charging and Reflection
On full moon nights, place a glass of water, crystals, or meaningful items on your windowsill to charge. The moon reflects the subconscious, so write a few lines in a journal about what has come to light for you — habits, thoughts, emotions. Just naming them is a spell in itself. If it's a new moon, write down something you're ready to begin, fold the paper, and tuck it under your pillow.

6. Salt at the Threshold
Sprinkle a pinch of salt across your doorstep or along the inside edge of your window sills. As you do, speak aloud or silently: ""Only welcome energy may enter."" Salt is ancient, protective, and grounding. It's also discreet. No one needs to know you're protecting your space unless you want them to.

7. Bath or Shower as Energy Recalibration
Use your evening shower to release tension — not just dirt. As water runs down your body, imagine it washing off emotional gunk, unwanted thoughts, or someone else's energy you might’ve picked up. You can whisper, ""I release what is not mine."" Add a few drops of lavender or rosemary oil if you want to take it further.

8. Candle Whispering Before Bed
Light a single candle at night, sit with it for a few minutes, and just watch the flame. Let your mind slow down. Say one wish or affirmation, like ""I am safe and guided in my rest."" Blow the candle out with gratitude. The soft focus this gives your nervous system is also deeply healing.

9. Whisper Magic into Your Shoes Before You Leave
Before putting on your shoes, hold them briefly. Whisper into them your path for the day: “Guide me to safe places. Let my words be heard. Let my steps be protected.” This imbues the day with direction and gentle spiritual armor. You're walking in a spell of your own making.


10. Thread Magic — Tie Knots into Your Hair or Jewelry
Plait a small piece of your hair, a bracelet, or a thread with intention. Each twist or knot can hold a wish or phrase. For example:
First knot: “For clarity.”
Second knot: “For calm.”
Third knot: “For truth.”
Wear it throughout the day or until it naturally unravels — that's your magic being released.



11. Earthing with Your Spine
Instead of the usual barefoot-on-the-ground grounding, try this: Sit with your back to a tree or lay flat on a patch of earth, letting your spine press fully into it. Trees and stones absorb chaos like nothing else. Stay just a few minutes, no phone. Let your breath fall into rhythm with the stillness of the earth beneath you. This re-regulates your energy, like spiritual acupuncture.



12. Washing Your Hands with Salt Before Intense Conversations
If you’re about to have a difficult conversation — at work, with a partner, even over the phone — wash your hands with salt or saltwater first. This breaks cords of energetic bias or baggage and brings neutrality. Dry your hands and say, “Only truth and balance.” You’ll notice the conversation flows differently.




13. Scent Anchoring Spells
Pick a very specific essential oil or perfume (one that you don’t use daily). Only wear it when doing something aligned with a specific goal — writing your novel, going on dates, practicing assertiveness, etc. Over time, your subconscious associates the scent with that version of you. This becomes a kind of trigger spell — every time you wear it, you embody that version of yourself again.



14. Mirror Shielding Ritual (Not Just for Glamour)
Most people use mirrors for self-image magic — but you can also use them to bounce back unwanted energy. Place a small mirror face-out behind your front door, or carry a tiny one in your bag. Whisper into the mirror: “What does not belong to me returns to sender.” You can also use your bathroom mirror — trace a symbol (rune, sigil, initial) with water or breath before a hard day.



15. Food Sigils on Your Plate
Before you eat, use your finger to draw a simple sigil or symbol into your food — on soup, rice, toast, coffee foam. It could mean strength, focus, peace. This seals energy into your body through taste and nourishment. You don’t have to see the sigil; the intention is enough. The act of eating then becomes an energetic contract.



16. Rainwater Charging for Emotional Balance
Collect rainwater (especially during a storm or just before dawn). Store it in a dark glass bottle. Use a drop of it on your pulse points or forehead when you’re feeling emotionally unbalanced. It carries the frequency of release and renewal. Rain caught on Mondays or during waning moons is especially potent for letting go.




17. The Paper Shred Spell
Write down a thought pattern, name, or feeling that is stuck — something looping in your mind. Don’t burn it — shred it into tiny pieces. As you do, breathe steadily and say, “This story no longer defines me.” Then scatter the paper outside or in a trash bin far from your space. It’s a modern form of cord-cutting, disguised as paperwork.




18. Shadow Companion Integration at Night
Before sleep, place a black stone (obsidian, onyx, or even smooth charcoal) beside your bed. Speak aloud something you hid during the day — an emotion, a thought, an insecurity. Let the stone hear it. Say: “You are seen. You are safe. You are no longer alone.” This allows your subconscious and shadow self to integrate, which leads to deeper intuition and clarity.

I recently freelanced for a week at a well-known post house in London. Before that, I met the managing director for a coffee at their office. We had a really nice chat, he mentioned that they were likely going to be hiring for a full-time position soon, but wanted to start with a freelance week to see how things went.

I did the week, got on well with the team, everything seemed smooth. On the Thursday (he left early that day), he said he’d be in touch the following week to talk more. But since then… radio silence. (I received my payment through their accountant the following Monday for the previous week's work.) 

I’ve followed up with three polite emails spaced out over a few weeks, just checking in, saying I’d love to stay involved, asking if there was any update. Nothing. No reply at all.

I get that people are busy and things change. But after meeting face-to-face, doing the freelance week, and hearing “we’ll talk next week,” I guess I’m just surprised there hasn’t been even a basic response like “thanks, but nothing right now.”

Is this just how things are sometimes? Curious to hear if others have had similar experiences.

Do you guys think I should just let it go and stop chasing? Lol.

# Best Laptop Cover Keyboard in 2025: Reviews & Guide

The laptop cover keyboard has evolved significantly in recent years, becoming an essential accessory for professionals and students alike. It combines the protective functionality of a laptop case with the enhanced typing experience of a dedicated keyboard. these devices are designed to improve ergonomics, productivity, and portability, transforming your laptop into a versatile workstation.

As we move towards 2025, the market is flooded with options, each boasting unique features and capabilities. Choosing the right laptop cover keyboard can be daunting, but this guide aims to simplify the process by providing in-depth reviews, comparisons, and recommendations. whether you need a keyboard for travel, work, or study, understanding the key features and benefits will ensure you make the best decision.

## key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a laptop cover keyboard hinges on several key features that directly impact its performance, durability, and user experience.

**Material Quality and Construction:**

The material used in the construction of the keyboard cover significantly impacts its durability and aesthetic appeal. High-quality materials, such as premium polycarbonate or durable fabrics like ballistic nylon, offer superior protection against scratches, bumps, and spills. Reinforced corners and edges enhance the cover's ability to withstand daily wear and tear, ensuring it lasts longer. A well-constructed keyboard cover provides a snug and secure fit, preventing the laptop from slipping or shifting during transport.**Keyboard layout and Key Travel:**

The keyboard layout is crucial for typing comfort and efficiency.A standard QWERTY layout with well-spaced keys minimizes errors and allows for faster typing speeds. Key travel, the distance a key moves when pressed, significantly affects the typing experience. Deeper key travel typically provides a more tactile and responsive feel, similar to a traditional keyboard. Backlit keys are essential for working in low-light conditions, enhancing visibility and reducing eye strain.

**Connectivity and Power:**

Most laptop cover keyboards connect via Bluetooth or direct physical connections (such as pogo pins or USB-C). Bluetooth connectivity offers wireless convenience, allowing you to detach the keyboard and use it separately, but may require occasional charging. Direct connections, conversely, provide a more stable and lag-free experience and typically draw power directly from the laptop. Battery life is a key consideration for Bluetooth models, with longer battery life reducing the need for frequent charging.**Trackpad Functionality and Precision:**

Many laptop cover keyboards include an integrated trackpad for enhanced navigation and mouse-like functionality. A responsive and accurate trackpad is essential for seamless cursor control and precise movements. Multi-touch gesture support, such as pinch-to-zoom and two-finger scrolling, further improves the user experience. The size and placement of the trackpad can also affect its usability, with larger trackpads offering more space for gestures and navigation.

**Protection and Portability:**

A primary function of a laptop cover keyboard is to protect the device from damage. Padded interiors and reinforced edges help absorb impacts and prevent scratches. The cover should also be lightweight and slim, adding minimal bulk to the laptop for easy portability. Features like magnetic closures or secure clasps ensure the cover stays closed during transport, preventing the laptop from accidentally opening or being exposed to elements.

key features of the next generation laptop cover keyboards include:

   Improved Bluetooth connectivity
   Enhanced material strength
   More optimized key travel
   Precise Multi-touch gesture support

## Core Benefits

A high-quality laptop cover keyboard offers several core benefits that can significantly enhance productivity and user experience.**Enhanced Productivity:** The primary benefit of a laptop cover keyboard is the improved typing experience. A full-sized or near full-sized keyboard layout with adequate key travel allows for faster and more accurate typing compared to the on-screen keyboard. This can dramatically increase productivity, especially for tasks that require extensive typing, such as writing documents, coding, or responding to emails.

**Improved Ergonomics:** Using a laptop cover keyboard can promote better posture and reduce strain on the wrists and hands. By providing a comfortable typing angle and reducing the need to hunch over the laptop, these keyboards can definitely help prevent repetitive strain injuries (RSIs). An external keyboard allows users to position the screen at a more comfortable viewing distance, further improving ergonomics.

**Portability and Convenience:** Laptop cover keyboards are designed to be lightweight and portable, making them ideal for users who are always on the go. The integrated cover protects the laptop screen from scratches and damage during transport,eliminating the need for a seperate case. The ability to quickly attach or detach the keyboard allows for seamless transitions between tablet and laptop modes, providing versatility for various tasks.

**Protection from Damage:** The rugged design of a laptop cover keyboard helps to protect the device from accidental spills, bumps, and scratches. The cover acts as a shield, preventing damage to the screen and keyboard. This added protection can extend the lifespan of the laptop and reduce the need for costly repairs.

## FAQs Section

**Are laptop cover keyboards compatible with all laptop models?**
No, laptop cover keyboards are typically designed to fit specific laptop models or sizes. It's crucial to check the compatibility before purchasing to ensure a proper fit and functionality. Some universal models exist,utilizing adjustable stands and Bluetooth connectivity to support a wider range of devices,but these may not offer the same level of protection or integration as model-specific covers.**How do I clean and maintain my laptop cover keyboard?**
To clean your laptop cover keyboard, first disconnect it from the laptop. Use a soft, lint-free cloth slightly dampened with water to wipe the surface. Avoid using harsh chemicals, solvents, or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the materials. For keyboards with fabric covers, gentle spot cleaning may be necesary to remove stains. Regularly removing dust and debris from the keys can also help maintain optimal performance.**What is the typical lifespan of a laptop cover keyboard?**
The lifespan of a laptop cover keyboard depends on several factors, including the quality of materials, frequency of use, and care taken during maintenance. with proper care, a high-quality laptop cover keyboard can last for several years. Key factors that can affect lifespan include battery life (for Bluetooth models), wear and tear on the keys and trackpad, and damage from spills or impacts.

I’ll be in Riyadh for a week soon for business purposes, and thought it would be nice to meet someone to hang out with after work. I’m 31, more of a calm and quiet type. I enjoy spending time with someone who’s easy to talk to and knows how to enjoy the moment.

I’m not into big crowds or loud places, I prefer simple things like coffee, a walk, or just sitting somewhere relaxed where we can talk and connect. I like private spaces and more quiet vibes.

Not expecting too much, just hoping to meet someone fun, open-minded, and chill. If we feel a good connection, I’m always open to see where things go. Chemistry is important, and I appreciate people who are real and comfortable to be around.

We’ve formed a special bond over the years and he’s the love and light of my life. I have one other cat whom I love very much but this kitten is my soul cat. 

I was separated from both my cats for a few months last year and it made me incredibly suicidal. We’ve been reunited since and things have been pretty okay. 

Yesterday, when I went out my room to make my morning coffee, I saw my cat cuddling with my housemate’s gf. I immediately started crying and shaking and I don’t even know why. I quickly ran into my room and cried about it for multiple hours. My partner had to come home from work and make me feel better. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed because I split on both the gf and my cat and had to lock myself in my room to regulate and feel better before I interact with them. 

I felt abandoned and like my kitten likes the gf more than me. He also hung out in their room instead of mine yesterday and this was just the cherry on top. 

I feel really emotionally overwhelmed when he gives other people attention. This includes my partner as well - I’ve had a big crash out before because my kitten played with my partner and not me. 

I’m so embarrassed and ashamed about this. I don’t know what to do. I know logically that he’s a cat and he doesn’t exist for the sole purpose of making me feel loved but he really means the world to me. I don’t know how to get over this shit and I feel so alone in my life. Nobody understands why I’m the way I am and I’m so scared everyone is gonna think I’m crazy :(((",3,1752043620.0,BPD,1,1.0,False

But I've finally designed a system that makes me not want to tear my eyes out whenever i look at my factories, and I wanted to share it with you guys, hoping it helps another spaghetti guy. This will be a longer read so get your coffee cup and enjoy !

The main star of this tutorial is this little guy:

https://preview.redd.it/9c1g3wpdhsbf1.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c57c9a9e0fa7d4ac043a19a986c81e3286b8780

Combined with this one:

https://preview.redd.it/7r5a8xiohsbf1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=448b6de74562a99b0c10cb6e8d4bb97c4e6a76cc

What these things do is allow me to very easily make highways that traverse the world, and i can place them super fast, with auto-connecting belts, this way i can achieve something like this immediately.

https://preview.redd.it/l1tncq6aisbf1.png?width=1514&format=png&auto=webp&s=9806ad720c9564b61280bc8abea352c9e4d69f7c

I plop these little highways towards resource nodes. Then it's just incredibly easy to gather everything in one spot, and bring my resources to my base in an organized manner. (ignore the concrete blocks on the ground, this is my main base so i didnt have the resources to build bridges in the very beginning)

Then its time to discuss base ""strategy""

https://preview.redd.it/3tesrrsvisbf1.png?width=1283&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae211b091cbc9a6b537153f505bddc2189306790

My bases are always large towers. The length of each side is always an odd number (i usually go 11x11 or 13x13), so that i can place my 3-blocks-long highways right in the middle.

The bottom floors are designed to gather resources that are in very close proximity to the base, then there's the highway floor, from which highways go in all directions. This makes centralizing resources a breeze.

My next advice is, really, just get silica production going on and build some glass windows. I stayed away from cosmetics for so long because I always thought ""well i cannot build anything nice anyway so why bother"", but just plopping a wall of glass on the factory makes it look like an actual building, rather than some floating tiles, and it takes no effort at all to do that.

Besides, now when you walk into your factory, you get to no longer feel nauseous, because from the inside, its actually pretty:

https://preview.redd.it/efej0kwwjsbf1.png?width=1695&format=png&auto=webp&s=762c2c6559159e707528435a2c0118ebd88aadd5

My next advice is: if youre a shit builder like I am, don't try to be overly-efficient with your factory space. Dont cram in multiple productions on one floor because theres still space. You will NOT get something nice. Sure, if it's like the one in the picture above u can put up something simple like a rotor production, but if not, resist the urge. just build another damn floor, its easy, and this way youll stop having a headache whenever u enter your floor. Nice clean floors means no spaghetti.

But what about productions that span over multiple floors? Inevitably youll have lifts that go above and come from below which will spaghettify your complex part production. Well what i like to do is draw an ""input-output"" zone.

https://preview.redd.it/ae8n0xquksbf1.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ccd2417017f2f2047aac93cebd05e4485e7099a

By doing this I make sure that i never run into the ""oh i need to put this resource on the floor above but i need to search for a spot so that my lift does not run directly into a constructor"". Problem solved, we have a line designed specifically for lifts. If you manage to get your lift there it is safe to put it up or down. Keeps things organized EFFORTLESSLY - effortlessly is the important word here. We're making things nice without being good builders.

3 more tips to go.

1. if you need ingots in your factory. do the ingots on the mining site, like this:

https://preview.redd.it/z9fxwxuilsbf1.png?width=1664&format=png&auto=webp&s=34ff159e57206f3b81f8c373300a23a5a1460cf3

This clears up a lot of your factory space, that would otherwise be taken by mindless smelters. You don't need all these things making noise on your floors. Bring what you need in your factory, without being overlyspecific (like bringing idk, iron rods). Factories are for constructors (and foundries).

2. Use signs

https://preview.redd.it/r2cojom8msbf1.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=388a4f7df419248512b2157ce1a1871a6e41da34

Do you know that feeling when you realise you need 30 more ingots for some other thing, but youre not sure if ""stealing"" ingots from a conveyor belt will mess up your production so you go around to your mining area to see how much youre mining and then to calculate how much youre using to see if you can get more or you should set up a new mining operation? Yeah. fuck that.

3. Use the damn blueprints.  
I've played SO many hours without ever using the blueprints because i couldnt get myself to understand how to use them efficiently. Well this is how:

https://preview.redd.it/j0m2e5g8nsbf1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=74c0e17d9ab3f28f5101e7bb4517a0ddc1dc8567

This very simple blueprint has a constructor, already linked to a splitter and a merger, this means i can chain constructors in a line and they will always very easily autoconnect. This saves SO much time in the long run (it actually saves time in the short run aswell), annoying as it is to create them. The only downside is they have to be maintained - chaning the mkBelts level as you go along, but it is SO worth it.

Then you should also make one the is mirrored. So the one above takes inputs from the ""up"" in splitters and spits them on the ""down"" in mergers. But you should have one that takes inputs from ""down"" and merges them ""up"". This way you can, based on what the situation requires, either place them left to right or right to left. If you are having trouble imagining what that would mean, and cannot position objects in space with your mind like I do, just take my word for it.

I make a blueprint for everything i need:

https://preview.redd.it/kl4qmtpynsbf1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=430202a823e10ae0b5de4fa09448bc0e2f2fe149

By putting them into the same subcategory i can easily switch between the mirrored and unmirrored version of the blueprint. So for instance if i select smelter1 and then press ""e"" it will take me to smelter2 directly. Very handy, this means i only need to put one blueprint of each type in my hotbar and I can easily cycle through them.

This makes for great factory design, because it forces you to put things in a line. No more ""oh i need 5 constructors but only 4 fit so ill just put the 5th one someplace random and connect"". Once you have the blueprints youll be to lazy to do that - yes things become so damn easy that even having to manually place one constructor will make you go ""ugghhhhh"" -, and it will just be easier to go on the next factory floor - architecture cleanliness and despaghetiffication achieved.

I hope this helps guys ! :) I know the more experienced players will find everything I said just obvious, but I hope that people who are newer can see this and dont have to spend as much time being terribly bad at the game and making shit factories as I did.

If you follow these tips you will also save time and you will stop ending up with factories that make your head hurt :D

Feels like I blew up my only shot and that slows down my healing.


I was in a situationship with an avoidant who discarded me 5 months ago and blocked me everywhere. We could not even reach the first date and there were already ups and downs. Whenever I couldn’t control my anxiety I confronted her for being so distant/cold and she used to keep saying she’s interested and wants to get coffee with me but never really showed interest when it actually came to planning it.

She is a pretty girl and I’ll never forget how she made me feel seen in the initial days of meeting her. I don’t even know now if any of that was real but I’d like to believe so.

A little background about me: 
I’m a 25m living away from family in a different country. Searching for a job since more than a year now but no luck. Had found one but then got terminated for no reason and that too a month after she blocked me everywhere. I’ve also never had a relationship before and never been on a date with someone. I truly wanted her to be my first. 

My question:
I’ve been on dating apps again recently but it is just as it was before meeting her - dry as fuck. I also tried approaching a girl at the gym who showed interest and gave me her number just to be ghosted after. 

In the meanwhile I’m kinda certain she’s already talking to some other guy or guys. It hurts a little more cause I can’t help but think that ‘I’ blew my only shot at being in a relationship. 

Before meeting the avoidant I wasn’t really feeling lonely being single but after she left me I’m just constantly clouded by this dark feeling of loneliness and hopelessness. People keep saying that I should work on myself and the right person will come but I don’t believe that’s going to happen. 

It feels a bit unfair cause she gets to move on like nothing happened or I didn’t even exist and she easily finds other guys and has options. Meanwhile I’m just broken and the moment I muster some courage to go out again and meet people it just leaves me heartbroken and feeling hopeless. ",1,1752043286.0,AvoidantBreakUps,2,1.0,False

My friend (sixteen years old) received a typed and printed hate letter from one of her other friends. We'll call her Trixie. Trixie is 24 years old, living with her parents, single, and goes to the same church as my friend. The letter was dropped off on my friend's doorstep two days ago, on Monday. Here's the entire letter, typos included exactly as originally written:**  
""  
Unfortunately it is now your turn to receive a letter from me. I first wrote one for Sarah because my head and my hear don't share when I speak things out. My heart always wins, so in this letter you will experience the bitter honesty in my head

I'm aware of all the possibilities of what I'm about to say and how they will affect you, but I cant keep doing this.

Not really sure where to start, so I'll try the beginning. When we first became friends I enisheated **(she meant initiated)** it because I was consumed by jealousy, to the point where I had a hatred of you and it was so sinful, I prayed and I prayed for a solution, and the verses kept entering my mind, ""love your enemies, and do good to those who persecute you."" and by God's will I started having coffee with you to try to get to know you and find ways we could be friends. And as far as my knowledge went it worked, but not for long.

The lake crew, if you ever want an Idea on how to thoroughly hurt somebody body and soul. invent a lake crew. Those whole years you guys were altogether were years of lie deseat **(deceipt)** and deception, you, Andi, and Anna were made to be with the Jeffersons. You all knew how to and were very good at playing the game. And I wasn't. I was cast aside and lied to over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.

But there was a silver lining. Andi and Sarah broke up. And I became your friend again because I felt like we shared something incoming and I felt bad for you because of all the pain Sarah had caused you. It was so nice to have a friend again after being in mind games and being lied to for four to six years. It was nice ....classic me l ignored the signs because all I ever wanted was a friend, but as time goes on I can't look at you without seeing SARAH. the same deceptive innocence, the same narcissist and the same manipulator. And now that I know what to look for and can see the ground works for another lake crew starting up i'm jumping ship. I can not go through that pain again, I cant. Im just so tired of being lied to, all ever want in a friendship is Honesty and maybe someday 'l ind it, but until then know that I will never trust you. I will still always love you like i still love Sarah, but i will not be part of your games.  
""  
**My friend saw Trixie less than 12 hours before receiving this letter, had planned her entire summer with her, and has no idea where the heck this came from or what she could've done. Keep in mind Trixie started the friendship out of jealously when my friend was 10, and Trixie was 16/17. All thoughts are extremely appreciated, my friend doesn't know what to do.**",0,1752042778.0,u_Personal_Gear5481,0,0.5,False

I’m bummed because I’m trying not to buy new clothes at the higher weight, but I think I need to so I stop wearing sweat pants and work out gear all the time.

The next thing I remember is a coolness on my legs and back. I was looking between a few different faces before registering them. “Hey there!” one of them said, driving home they were all looking at me. A fluorescent bulb gargled energy over the room, its light and noise burrowing into my head like a drill.

“How you feeling?” Asked a girl whose posture and eyes were reminiscent of a frog.

“Like someone tried to turn me into gravel,” I said. My voice was coarse and weak.

“Well, you’re alive,” chuckled the girl with a hand on the frog-girl’s back. I groaned. This bathroom was almost clean; the touchless sinks and faux marble counters were practically modern. A broad-shouldered guy slid off the counter. He approached with his hand out. Two red pills sat in the deep crevices of his palm, contrasting the brilliantly yellow wristband.

“These should help,” he said.

“Thanks,” I muttered, taking the pills. One at a time, I put them on my tongue, using my teeth to push the chemicals further back toward my throat so it would be easier to swallow. When I failed trying to get up, the frog-girl stood up. Taking one hand, her partner took the other; they pulled me to my feet. I made way for me to stand in front of the closest sink.

“Egh,” I voiced at my own appearance.

“It’s not that bad,” the pill supplier said. They weren’t wrong, but I didn’t agree.

“Can’t have fun and stay clean,” Frog-girl giggled before hopping up to sit on the counter by me. She went on to pull a few strands of hair from where it was stuck on my temple and cheek. “Do I want to know?” 

“I don’t,” I responded. The pill supplier nodded knowingly.

“We can get you right-as-rain, as they like to say,” Frog-girl remarked, holding a mostly clean shirt beneath the sink, which immediately began to spit warm water.

“Who’s they?” I glanced over at the wide-eyed girl. She shrugged.

“You probably only wash this in cool water, huh?” Frog-girl asked as she dabbed around my hairline and neck.

“Ye’.”

Frog-girl hummed in response. She was quickly becoming lost in her gentle work. Her partner squeezed the smaller girl’s knee before stepping back to lean between the stall doors.

“You make it through the Show-Room Floor yet?” Asked the pill supplier propped up by one arm further down the bathroom counter.

“Don’t think so. What are they playing there?”

“It’s been a wide mix. I got to spin for fifteen minutes as an opener.”

“You produce?”

“A bit. Weird shit, though.”

“A bold statement.”

“I used to be in like this post-emo midwest country metal band. I take a lot of influence from that stuff and infuse it into a lot of dubstep.”

“Alright, that is a bit weird.”

“Told ya,” he chuckled.

“Look over there,” Frog-girl said, pushing a finger against my cheek. Casually, I obeyed and looked away from Frog-girl. She was now wetting her hand in the sink that sputtered in response to her presence. The soaked hand went on to run through my hair in a way that soothed without the usual panic such intimacy brought.

“Sorry, I missed it,” I said out of obligation. The weird music artist dismissed the sentiment with a wave of his hand.

“Probably not the last time I’ll be on stage.”

I nodded only to have a hand placed flat on top of my head. “Stay still, please,” Frog-girl said. Her touch was delicate as she began to tug and arrange strands of hair.

“How many dance floors are there? I’ve been to at least three so far.” I glanced between the artist in front of me to one side, where I could almost see Frog-girl in the mirror’s reflection, and then to the other, where her partner stood. The partner just shrugged.

“I’ve learned to not ask,” the artists responded.

“Only Monarch ever knows,” Frog-girl said, her voice distant.

“Monarch?”

“ .“ No one responded.

It was Frog-girl who broke the tension of the room, and I’m still reasonably confident she wasn’t completely tuned in. “Face me,” she said, tugging on my chin. I obeyed. Facing each other, she leaned low then high, tilted her head, and pursed her lips. She then began to pat around her body in search of something unclear. It was her partner who stepped forward, pulling a hip pack from her shoulder that was then put in Frog-girl’s hands. “Thank you,” she sang, beaming at the other girl, who replied with a simple smile and nod.

“Now is probably your last chance to escape,” Artist chuckled.

“She’s alright,” I said. Frog-girl rummaged in her pack and pulled out eyeliner, concealer, a small blush pallet, highlighter, lip gloss, and an eyeshadow pallet with pans smaller than her fingertips.

“You’re in good hands; she basically lives for this,” Partner added as if to calm some unexpressed anxiety.

“And you?” I didn’t realize I was turning my head till Frog-girl stopped it with a furrowed brow and short-lived pout, hands on my cheeks.

“I paint, but I’ve been cooking a lot more recently.”

“You all go to art school together or something?” I observed of their shared creative tendencies.

“Nah, we just lucky to be friends,” Artist said. “What about you?”

“I spend a lot of evenings out dancing if I can get away from work.”

“Obvs, so do we,” Partner and Artist chuckled.

“What else?” Partner probed.

“I used to take ballet.”

“Used to?”

“It’s been hard to find a reliable time I can squeeze it in around work and shit.”

“It sounds like labor is your current hobby,” Artist said. My cheeks turned hot, and anger flashed over my mind. He wasn’t wrong, but putting it like that felt so disheartening.

“Maybe,” I muttered.

“That can always change,” Partner said, the response of the canned obligated variety. I lifted an unconfident hand to acknowledge the remark.

“Done!” Frog-girl announced. She leaned back and held her arms out to bring attention to her work. I recall turning to the mirror and being astounded by how subtle yet vibrant her craftsmanship was. I couldn’t remember the last time I had seen someone pay such detail to something as temporary as someone else’s makeup.

“Wow,” was all I could manage through the choke of emotion.

“I know, right!”

“Where to now?” Artists asked. At first, I thought he was asking his group, but then I noticed them all looking at me.

“I’m not sure. Maybe I’ll try to find the Show-Room Floor.” They nodded.
“Don’t go easy on them,” Frog-girl encouraged, eliciting laughs from her friends.

“I won’t,” I assured, mustering a smile I hoped was confident. As I stepped to leave, Partner signaled for me to stop.

“Wrist,” she asked for. I held out my bracelet-laden wrist. Partner pulled one of her half-dozen bracelets off and added it to my wrist. The jewelry was comprised of wooden beads threaded together with a section that used emblazoned orbs to spell ‘E S C A P E !’.

“Thanks,” I said, watching it slide further down my arm than the fabric wristband would.

“It’ll serve you better than me,” she assured with a pat on my shoulder.
I waved goodbye to the group and worked my way around those entering the bathroom to re-enter the muted halls.

--------------

Red LEDs trimmed where the walls met floor and ceiling. Crowds pulled each other left, right, and forward. The doors spaced every three feet were the locus of attention. Sometimes, giggling couples fell through them, other times, the door refused entry and the party trying to find entry would go try another.

Of the directions available, I chose left.

My mind, though not actively in pain anymore, was still tired. There was a film soaking my thoughts like a thin layer of Vaseline. Eventually, I found myself counting doors. One, two, three, a blue door strained against its frame. Five, six, the yellow door practically glowed. It hurt my eyes. Eight, nine. Did I count that door that blended in with the wall? Yeah, I had laughed at it, thinking it could hide from me. Ten, eleven, twelve, black. The door was a textured black, with flecks of white and gray, making it look more like a textile than a piece of architecture. I stopped in front of the black door. No one else seemed interested in the black door; those trying to find one that would let them pass didn't even try the black door.

I suppose at the time, I felt it fell on me. There was a sense of necessity, of participation. I needed to do my part.

A gentle push, the door swung open. I excised myself from the crowd and entered the room. The door clicked shut behind me, leaving hardly enough time for me to drag my foot over the frame.

The room was a small, small, small square space. In the center was a coffee table that was more akin to a footstool. Except for the door, seating was built against every available space of wall. Across the room, the wall was a mirror where I stared at myself. I held my attention as I sat in front of the mirror with my calves pinned to my thighs. The slow pulse of my heart brought a tugging pressure from my foot.
""Are you me,"" I inevitably asked.

""I suppose,"" I voiced for my reflection.

""I know me, though, and I don't think you look like me.""

""Are you unhappy with how you look?"" The question tipped the corners of my lips down in a frown.

""Always, though a little less than usual right now.""

""So am I not you?"" My reflection's expression softened, eyebrows lifting with the inquiry.

""I don't know."" I threw my hands up.

""Why not?"" My reflection leaned closer.

""Just. Something is off.""

""Are you sure you know yourself?"" I watched my reflection's cheeks turn a heated red, and I felt it on my face.

""Not so much these days."" I looked away from my reflection, who was there when my gaze returned.

""Then why do you get to decide who's you?""

""Cause I'm the only one that can.""

""You're being evasive,"" my reflection accused.

""I'm being as clear as I can be,"" I defended.

""At least that hasn't changed,"" my reflection mocked. I scoffed at my reflection before standing up. My reflection didn't move.

""You aren't me,"" I stated, now sure.

""Neither are you,"" the reflection said in a pitch lower than my natural voice. Reflection began to push on the mirror, causing the reflective material to bend. The echoed room started to soak in an inky tar that dripped down from the ceiling. The viscous substance dripped onto my reflection's head, soaking them and tinting them charcoal like a shadow.
The glass pulled on the hands pressing forward, strained like a sheet. I backed against the door that remained shut. The mirror squealed and hissed, attempting to restrain Reflection. I fumbled with the door handle, but it wouldn't open. 

Riiiipppp.

The mirror split like a plastic tarp. The ink from the mirrored world sprayed into the room before running down the ripped mirror and dripping onto the seating. Reflection, now little more than a silhouette with clear eyes, fell into the room. They collapsed onto the chair, and then their forehead smacked against the floor. Ink spilled from them onto the floor. Reflection's dripping hand reached out for my ankle. I stepped away and onto the furniture. Reflection used the coffee table to help themselves up before lunging at me. Their hands grabbed at the collar of my shirt, smearing the burning liquid around the garment and my neck. Nothing is quite as fowl in the mundane way as the smell of burning hair. I managed to pull away and stumbled off the chair. The slow-motion attack blurred into a sudden burst of chaos as I fell off the chairs. A loud thwack resounded through my head, giving voice to the stinging pain coming from the back of my skull. I blinked and blinked, but my eyes refused to show more than a wash of colors split apart by lightning-like lines induced by pain. 

A tug at my leg yanked me out of my concussed state. Reflection's hands grasped at my good foot, smearing the shoe and causing the sole to soften and deform. I pulled away from the weak grip and clambered up toward the mirror. 

I wasn't thinking of anything but getting away when I vaulted through the mirror. When my feet met ground, I just ran; I sprinted until I collided with a wall.

I was sprawled on my back when I finally realized I couldn't see anything except a pinprick of white in the direction I had come from. The ink had stopped burning, but I could feel it clinging to my neck and weighing down my shirt.

I knew better than to give in to the urge to close my eyes and rest, even if just for a second. My ears still rang. A touch at the back of my head felt something wet, not a lot, but enough to worry. I groaned getting back up, and everything, including my inner ear, tried to tell me to lay back down.
Cautiously, I touched the wall I had run into, finding it cool and smooth to the touch. I kept my hand on the wall and used it to guide my steps. Further and further into the dark I went. When there was a corner, I turned left and kept following the wall. Repeat. One step after the other. Left turn at the corner. Repeat again. Step, step, step, step. Corner, turn.
Wait, that should make a complete loop. As I continued down the wall again, I kept an eye out for the single light, the lone color, that had been the mirror. I didn't find it. Even as I stepped and stepped and stepped and stepped and stepped. Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot. Down the wall I went for far longer than I had any previous wall.

Then, there was a right turn. Something new. Then, a left turn. Then, two right turns. At some point, I began to lose track of which turns I had taken. I was roused from my single-minded stupor when I felt a seam. Gliding my hand around, I found the seam gave outline to what I could only hope was a door. My suspicion was confirmed when my palm hit against a nob. I didn't entirely register the space on the other side of it as I stepped into it. In part, at least, because my eyes needed to adapt. The door snapped shut as soon as I had traversed it.

I was back in the hallways of doors, but now it was empty. There was no end to the halls in sight.

Plop. Plop. Plop plop plop plop.

A wet smacking sound made my gut feel full of ice. From down one of the halls ran Reflection, leaving footprints and droplets of ink.

I reacted like an animal. I fled. I sprinted. I tried to outpace Reflection, but the rising volume of their gate told me I was failing. I hit at a door as I passed it, and it was as still as the wall.

Plopplopplopplopplop

Reflection was almost upon me. I skidded to a halt and threw myself to one side, causing Reflection to fall over and roll past me. I turned on a heel and began a fresh sprint, my foot stinging and my lungs burning. I coughed, my own breath smelling of stale cigarette smoke.

Plop Plop

Reflection was back on their feet. They began running again, and I stopped, ready to give up. I turned to face them. At least this way, maybe I could skirt around them for another minute or two. They grew larger and larger at the center of the hall as they drew close.

""Hey!"" I discovered myself at an intersection. Down one of the crossing halls was Poncho. ""You're almost late."" She grabbed my hand and pulled me with her into a stretch of concrete that echoed with the chatter of a crowd.

""For what?"" I asked rather dumbly.

""Silhouette,"" Poncho said, voice spilling pure glee. Despite her small size, or maybe because of it, she was able to weave through the crowd and yank me into the gaps she created. We fought our way through a pair of double doors that hung open by the barest thread of their hinges.

--------------

Poncho continued to guide our way through the people that had packed themselves into the room. There was no music just yet, only the strained, excited chatter of people trying to find anything to talk about to avoid counting the seconds. The room was tiered, railings marking the drop in each tier. It reminded me of an old theater. The stage was dark, with textured shadows milling about. Poncho pulled me into a spot by them at the second lowest tier near the railing. They grabbed onto the old, gilded, and rusted structure and bounced on the balls of their feet. “We made it,” Poncho declared.

“Did you come looking for me?” I asked, still a bit dazed from the most recent escape.

“No, you were just kind of there.”

“Oh, well, thanks anyways.”

“No problem! No one should miss Silhouette. After this, I’m sure you’ll absolutely need to come to my screening.”

“Probably,” I chuckled. What little light had been in the room faded away. Poncho and about everyone else in the room began screaming, forming a wildly textured wall of noise. Behind the stage, a battery of pure white lights turned on, leaving the DJ booth and its operator as just the suggestion of shapes. Above, a TV flickered on to white noise. A deep hum drowned out the screaming. A movie clip of a young blond boy appeared on the screen. “They’re all here. Can we go now?” The white noise inter-spliced to an interior shot of some fantasy cockpit. “Let’s go mother-fuckers!” The actress yelled. The energy was immediate.

Kick drums pummeled the crowd along with a screeching synth, and a bellowing bassline swerved around the snares. Chattering hats came with the urge to bounce, and the crowd indulged. I was immediately entranced, bouncing with Poncho, who I thought was about to throw herself over the railing into the pit on the level below us that had people moshing with thrown elbows and clashing bodies. The screen above the DJ flashed between old movie clips that featured groups gathering, sometimes flying saucers, sometimes scientists.

Silhouette continued much that way, bridging between songs with spliced-together movie clips that had the crowd yelling for more even as they sweated and tried to catch their breath. I’m not sure how, but at some point, I lost Poncho. I can only speculate (hope?) that they went straight to the front of the crowd and took their place directly in front of the stage.

At least I didn’t miss Silhouette.

--------------

After Silhouette left the stage, I found myself carried on the tide of the crowd and out some door at the side of the room. Rapidly, the mass of people thinned as people fell off down one hallway or another. Eventually, I was alone again, cracked and cold concrete defining four possible directions. I chose right.

Silence walked with me, dominating the conversation around the sound of occasional dripping and my uneven footsteps as I was careful with my heavy and still-aching foot. Standing through an entire set certainly hadn't helped. The crude wrap I had made was squishing and crunching under my weight.

The further down the concrete hall I went, the more common doors that were bolted into their frames and large office windows that were boarded up became. The irregular pace of dripping water was almost annoying.

Ddlop . . . Dlop . . Dlllop . . . . . . Ddlop

I was surprised this much space was going unused by the event after everything else I had already seen.

Dlop . . . . Dlop . . . Dlop . . Plop

The hair standing up on the back of my neck told me something was wrong. I initially dismissed it as a sudden surge of primordial instinct. Yes, I was alone in an abandoned concrete hallway; I didn't need my fight-or-flight instinct telling me this was an unsafe scenario.

Plop . . Plop . . Plop . . Plop

My head began to hurt as my senses attempted to heighten. My usually narrow field of view became overwhelming as my mind tried to process more. The dripping of water was like the pop of fireworks at an inconsiderate hour. However, the dripping was now coming regularly. It was also too loud and firm. That's the thought that had me stop resisting my animal urge. I halted.

Plop . . Plop . . Plop . . Plop

The sound was getting louder. On some base level, I knew that meant it was getting closer. I needed to check; some part of me held onto the hope that I was overreacting. So I turned around.

Plop . . Plop

Reflection slowly moved down the hall. Their clear eyes were fixed on me, and through the tar coating them, it was almost possible to make out a smile. Its slow pace began to pick up. ""Fuck,"" I exhaled before breaking into a run. Running on that unforgiving floor was like beating my injured foot with a bat. Consistent steps kept finding new places to trigger aches and sharp pains.

Plop plop plop plop

Reflection wasn't held back by any such injury. A door hanging open ahead ignited a new hope. Singleminded determination focused on the door. The steps that sounded as if they were striking the ground right at my heels were ignored with purposeful ignorance. I grabbed at the door to help me curve my path out of the hall.

I didn't expect the steps and fell down, hitting my shoulder, back, and burn. I was able to forget about my foot for the time being as my arm began to feel like someone had just tried to cut it off. My limbs worked in disharmony to get me back to my feet just in time to watch Reflection skid to a stop at the top of the stairs.

I tried to flee, only to quickly discover that the single short path available to me led to a balcony that overlooked a room that all too closely resembled the one Silhouette had played in.

Pp-plop Pp-plop

Reflection was skipping down the steps. The drop couldn't be that bad, right? Fifteen feet? A human could survive fifteen feet. Break something? Maybe. But it definitely should be survivable. I jumped over the balcony edge. The familiar lack of support swept up over me. Much quicker than I had anticipated, my body exploded with the sensation of collision; the nexus of the new hurt was my chest. I couldn't even tell that I was unable to breathe. Then something dark and misshapen fell past me before the room was filled with a breaking crunch and splattering squelch.

As my senses emerged from the shining pain, I discovered I had landed against the railing of an elevated seating section that overlooked the ground floor from under the balconies. Below, Reflection lay with limbs twisted in directions that my body couldn't naturally replicate. I had misjudged the distance to the floor.

Breathing felt like a steel brush was scrubbing around my torso. Part of my chest was sensitive to touch and more sensitive to pressure. Fractured ribs made the most sense as an answer. Later, I'd learn I had four hairline fractures divided between three ribs. Even as the ache of the sudden stop faded, it felt like I was inhaling burning metal scrap.

Around the elevated seating section, there was no obvious way down, nor was there any indication of how anyone was expected to get up. I walked along the back wall again and then again. Nothing. Limping the railing that overlooked the ground floor yielded the same result. Reflection was still down there doing their best imitation of a dysmorphic self-portrait.
There was no exit. Well, I guess that's not entirely true. I wasn't looking for an exit. Reflection had already taken the easiest. 

The narrow and shallow seat was more comfortable than expected. However, that could have just been the relief expressed by the growing list of injuries.

-Arm: a burn that only occasionally felt like my skin was stretching apart when bumped or moved too much.
-Foot: a deep glass-made incision that plagued my whole leg. The makeshift cloth bandaging was soaked.
-Chest: a few fractured ribs.
-Head: blunt force injury, relatively minor, the bleeding had stopped, maybe still concussed.
-Neck: Skin irritated by some sticky black goo that had hardened like mud and was actively flaking off.

I wanted to keep going. I didn't want to find the exit; I wanted to find the next path that would lead back further into the rave. I wanted to find Rabbit and tell them everything I had experienced. I wanted a moment of sympathy, but only a moment. I didn't need anyone to pour over me or truly worry for me and try to pull me out. I wanted someone who could appreciate the pain I had been put through but, in equal part, admire it.
Validation. Nothing felt as good as suffering that became a reward and complimented some self-aggrandizing personal trait.

The world swiveled upside down as I leaned back in the seat and let my head fall back. There, hanging from the floor-ceiling, was a charcoal door. Its black tone was highlighted by non-natural colors of light seeping in from the other side. Upright, there was no door, just more plain wall. Turning myself upside down near the wall did not produce the door, but repeating my previous action did. Back at the chair, with head turned the wrong way, the door was there.

Crawling out of the row required moving one limb at a time. A foot would be slid over the ground and maneuvered around whatever it hit against. Then, a hand would search through the air for some solid support. Then, the next foot, followed by the next hand. At the end of the row, I twisted my body into awkward angles until I lay in the lane. The door was still in view. Moving up the lane was a bit more fluid but still slow. Nothing on me appreciated being backward and upside down. At some point, a hip almost popped out of place. That used to be more common when I danced regularly.

The door needed nothing more than a gentle push to swing open. Out of an abundance of caution, I passed through the door every which way but upright.

--------------

Clem!

I was through, the door was shut. Sitting up was a battle between muscles that didn't want to work and aches that wanted to relax. Eventually, I managed. In this hallway, the floor was above. When there are four slabs of concrete, it can be challenging to say for sure which way is right-side up. There's little tells though. Concrete that has been regularly walked on has a distinct character, with stains, scuffs, and cracks. Ceilings are often more whole and less damaged. So, despite what the door beside me indicated, I was confident I was on the ceiling.
A short break proved quite invigorating. It didn't solve anything, but it made it easier to pretend. 
The hall gave only one direction to go. Further down the hall, my thesis was given more evidence; a set of braced doors indicated the floor hovered over me. Soon, it hung over a slowly growing crowd. People were starting to move through the hallway. Some walked, some ran. People leaned against the wall. There were groups, afraid to lose each other, who Daisy chained their arms together and worked through the crowd like a snake. Couples acted like no one else in the hall existed, often to the detriment of traffic.
I was among the crowd but separate. No one looked remotely as rough as I felt. Yet, few gave me a first look, let alone a second. On some level, I still blended in. Maybe a bit too well.
At the third juncture, something on the ceiling-floor gave me pause. A small black sign that had once read 'Staff.' Grafitti had been utilized to scratch out the original text and replace it with 'Drinks.' A drink certainly didn't sound like the worst idea of the evening. The arrow guided the new destination.
The hallway was short and ended at what was definitely the entry to a meat locker. The door had been taken off its hinges and set to the side, the lock dangling off to one side. Getting through it required climbing the ledge that kept the doorway on the floor above. I passed into the cramped space with a small contingent of guys in muscle tees and shorts that had to stretch to accommodate their thighs. They were kind enough to boost me up and pull me over the ceiling-wall.
Passing into the space, the temperature plummeted, and the sludge of footsteps and chatter was eaten by bright stabs and inorganic claps. Drums rolled out of the quiet to an outcry from the crowd. ""Let me fucking breath,"" some autotune voice yell-sang before a detuned kick and a Fsharp Bass stab hit the room like a defibrillator. The dance floor of eighty or so people off to my left, which at max probably should have had two dozen, began to bounce with the hardstyle. Synths took turns cutting through a melody with enough low end to shake frost from the walls.
Off to the right was a bar manned by Bartender 1 and Bartender 2. Upon approaching, the two stood closest to where the bar hung over my head. I had to be careful to step around the fluorescent light patches that had been taped over to reduce their overall intensity.
""Hey there!"" The Bartender with a serpent skeleton on her left hip said. That made her Bartender 2.
""Just water?"" Bartender 1 asked, putting her hand on the same tattoo on the opposite hip.
""Actually, could use a drink this time."" I crossed my arms, ensuring my burn was untouched and unblocked in the process.
""That's our specialty,"" Bartender 1 practically sang, fetching a cup from under the bar. Bartender 2 plucked up a bottle of liquor and spun it in their hand.
""Find Rabbit?"" Bartender 2 asked.
""Briefly. Looking for them again."" 
""Sounds about right,"" Bartender 1 said as she added something red to my drink along with silver glitter.
""About right?""
""Rabbit hunting isn't much fun if the hare is caught,"" Bartender 2 said. She pushed the drink over the bar closer to me. I leaned against the counter and graciously accepted the drink.
""This isn't quite analogous,"" I offered. The drink was satisfyingly bitter, almost sour.
""Is it not?"" The two asked, one putting their elbow on the other's shoulder.
""It isn't. I mean, I don't think it is.""
""Need to be a bit more confident than that,"" Bartender 1 said. I almost couldn't hear them over the jumpy percussion that cued the room to move with such vigor I thought the floor would break open under them. I grimaced behind the glass lifted to my lips.
""You haven't seen them, have you?""
""Nope."" Bartender 1.
""Sorry."" Bartender 2.
""Though,"" Bartender 1 began. Bartender 2 narrowed her eyes ever so briefly, her gaze fixed on her partner. ""I heard that Monarch is on a bit of a hunt themself.""
""Good to know,"" I said, though I wasn't sure how that information actually impacted my situation. The warmth the drink provided was just enough to keep the chill of the room at bay.
""So, are you going to concede or compete?"" Bartender 1 asked, leaning on their hands in front of me.
""Compete,"" I said as if the answer should have gone without clarification.
""Monarch doesn't lose,"" Bartender 2 said, standing beside Bartender 1.
""I don't like losing.""
""For the better to give up then,"" Bartender 2 started.
""I don't intend to lose,"" I interrupted to clarify.
""You understand Rabbit isn't a prize,"" Bartender 1 said.
""Of course, no one should be.""
""Except maybe yourself,"" Bartender 1 said. I wasn't sure how to respond, so I finished my drink. Despite all the space at the bar, I became aware of someone taking the spot right by me as hair entered my periphery.
""I was hoping to find you here."" Sunglasses voice cut through the track demanding the crowd to go harder and harder.
""You have quite the habit of showing up where I do,"" I commented.
""Hey there,"" the Bartenders said in unison, voices oozing honey while they waved at Sunglasses.
""Usual, please,"" he requested of them. He then returned to our conversation. ""You have the habit of being where I expect you to be.""
""Are you following me?""
""Hardly.""
""Have you seen Rabbit?""
""For both our benefits, I'm going to say no."" Sunglasses grinned at me, my frowning lips given prominence in the reflection of their namesake.
""That's not helpful.""
""Wasn't meant to be. You going to dance?"" Sunglasses jerked a thumb to gesture at the already overpacked floor. They then thanked the bartenders for a placid-looking purple drink.
""Not here; that's a bit harder than I can go right now.""
""If you want to dance somewhere a bit calmer, try the Pool Stage.""
""I just might.""
""You know your fit is looking a bit worn through?""
""Yeah, thanks,"" I grumbled. To hide my embarrassment, I tried to take a swig of my drink only to discover it was empty, which increased the embarrassment. If Sunglasses noticed, they didn't indicate.
""Makeup is nice though, leagues above easily.""
""Thanks."" I genuinely meant it that time. ""The artist did really good work.""
""Hope it's water resistant.""
""Oh, me too."" I furrowed my brow, now realizing that I might be one misstep from ruining the delicate work that had done my features such 
justice.
""Well, if it isn't, not everything can last forever.""

""Would be boring if they did.""

""Actually, watch your head this time,"" Sunglasses said after finishing their drink. They exchanged parting sentiments with the Bartenders and then left, their arm slipping around the corner last.

Just yesterday he drank a cup of coffee to stay up with me until 5am and had to wake up at 7am. Took no nap, got back from work, called me and stayed up till 1am. FINALLY, he went to sleep. But no, around 2 hours later he’s up again and it happens all the time. If he goes to sleep at 10pm he wakes up a 3 or 4am and he’s perfectly functioning. Is it possible he has some sort of insomnia or sleep deprivation disorder? He says that’s just how he’s always been but I’m scared he’s gonna wake me up in the middle of the night when we move in together or that he might be hurting his health.",1,1752042479.0,sleep,2,1.0,False
1lvboco,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1lvboco/seeking_superautomatic_advice_for_latte_drinker/,Seeking superautomatic advice for latte drinker,"Hi All,

I am mostly a latte drinker. Currently I have a Breville Barista Express that I use to pull espresso shots and steam the milk. I have been using it for over 5 years now. It works great and is dialed in exactly how I like it with my medium roast coffee, but sometimes I feel too lazy to go through the whole process, especially when making coffee for my entire family or when friends are visiting. Also, my spouse finds it too complicated and would prefer a one touch solution.

Last holiday season I tried out the De Longhi Magnifica Evo, but we just couldn't like the coffee even after 2 weeks of tweaking and experimenting. We found it either too watery or too muddy and ended up returning it.

So, I am looking for advice on what would be a good superautomatic for my use case under $2.5k. Something low maintenance would be ideal. Currently from my research the Kitchen Aid KF8 (I qualify for Inside Pass), DeLonghi Eletta Explore, Gaggia Accademia or Jura J8 seem to be my best bet. If it helps, I don't really care about gimmicks like sweet foam or profiles, I just want good quality espresso with rich micro foam milk. I am based in the US. Thanks in advance!

1lvbkzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lvbkzh/aita_for_refusing_to_clean_up_after_my_28yearold/,AITA for refusing to clean up after my 28-year-old cousin who disrespects me every school holiday?,"So I (16M) live with my aunt and uncle, and their daughter (my cousin, 28F) and son (21m), who still live at home. We’re currently not on speaking terms, and honestly, this has been building for a while.

This all started during the school holidays. My sister (15F) and I were doing the dishes, and I heard ducks making noise on the roof of a nearby 5-story apartment building. I sometimes imitate animal sounds just for fun, and apparently my cousin thought it was me. She snapped at me, telling me to ""STOP MAKING THAT SOUND."" I calmly told her it wasn’t me — it was the ducks. She never apologized or acknowledged it. I left it, but from that day on, I stopped talking to her.

Later that same week, I was packing away dishes and needed to open a drawer she was standing in front of. She looked at me and didn’t move. When I tried to go around her, she asked, ""Why can’t you ask me to move?"" I told her, “You never ask, so why should I? You can’t want respect when you don’t give any.” I also told her how she always picks fights with me but never sees when she’s wrong.

I even phoned her mom (my aunt) to explain what was going on, but she did nothing. That same day, my cousin only washed her own dishes and left the rest for others — which she often does.

Fast forward to today: She left her dirty dishes on the kitchen island for two hours and spilled coffee on a chair — just walked away and left it. When she came back and saw it was still there, she looked visibly annoyed but didn’t say a word. She ended up cleaning it herself, but it clearly bothered her.

Later, my aunt got home and asked me (with attitude) why I hadn’t mopped the floor. I genuinely forgot, and as she was scolding me, I saw my 28-year-old cousin smirking like she was enjoying it. She even gave me a dirty look when she noticed I saw her smirk.

And this isn’t new behavior. Every school holiday, she finds a way to start drama with me. It’s like clockwork. She does nothing all holiday, just sits around, but somehow acts like we're the ones who need to go. She literally treats me and my sister like intruders, even though we live here too. One time I asked if I could use a little cheese to make something for her brother (older than me), and she said “no.” When he came to ask, she flat out denied ever saying it.

She lies, plays victim, talks over me when I try to explain, and constantly tries to make me look crazy or unstable.

I know she doesn’t want me in the house — and I’ve accepted that. So when I eventually move out, no one better act surprised.

Anyway, AITA for refusing to clean up after her or treat her with respect when she constantly disrespects me?

The idea of going through my  budget just seemed so overwhelming and so boring! Boring tasks and ADHD is not a good match!

Well, this week I finally ripped the band-aid off and spent a few hours getting a complete overview of my household budget along with my wife whom actually is working with finances for a living. And holy shit! Seeing what I'm wasting money on was a little heartbreaking at first but after a while I felt quite happy. I could finally see the main reason that I don't feel like I have any money!

We now have an updated budget and we defined an amount of money that we can ""waste"" every month on fun stuff: Getting coffee, buying videogames, going to the movies ect..

I've been telling myself for years that I couldn't afford to invest, but now I see a clear path to start putting money into stocks and building a real future for myself. The inflation just eats up your bank savings! Money needs to grow.

It feels like a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I'm not just guessing anymore; I have a plan! And the feeling of empowerment is just amazing.

If you've been putting this off, please take this as your sign to just do it. It's so worth it! Feeling so happy and optimistic about the future today!",1,1752042011.0,iamsohappytoday,0,1.0,False
