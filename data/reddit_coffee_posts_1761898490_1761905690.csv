1okqd9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1okqd9j/how_broken_link_checker_helps_bloggers_and/,How Broken Link Checker Helps Bloggers and Developers Save Hours,"If you're a blogger or a developer, you've probably wrestled with the frustrating problem of broken links. They're not just a nuisance—they can seriously harm user experience, SEO rankings, and your website’s credibility. But here’s the good news: using a broken link checker can be a complete game-changer. This simple yet powerful tool can save you hours of tedious manual checking and help keep your site clean, professional, and user-friendly.

Let’s explore exactly how it makes your life easier.

# 1. Time-Saving Automation

Manually clicking through every link on your website is not only boring, but also incredibly time-consuming—especially for content-heavy blogs or large web apps. A broken link checker automates this process by scanning your entire site and flagging dead or outdated links in minutes. You can check hundreds of links in the time it takes to grab a coffee.

# 2. Improves SEO Effortlessly

Search engines like clean, well-maintained websites. Broken links signal poor site maintenance, which can negatively impact your rankings. By fixing these issues quickly with the help of a broken link checker, you ensure your site stays SEO-friendly without investing hours of manual labor.

# 3. Enhances User Experience

Imagine a reader clicks a link in your blog post expecting helpful information, only to land on a 404 error page. Frustrating, right? A site riddled with broken links can drive visitors away and lower your credibility. Regularly scanning your content with a broken link checker keeps your site functional and user-focused.

# 4. Supports Website Health and Maintenance

For developers, especially those working on complex or collaborative projects, maintaining link integrity is part of good site hygiene. A broken link checker helps you catch mistakes early, such as incorrect URLs or outdated internal links. It's an easy way to keep things running smoothly behind the scenes.

# 5. Keeps Content Fresh

Link rot is real. Over time, content gets removed, sites go offline, and URLs change. A broken link checker helps you spot and replace those dead ends, keeping your content relevant and trustworthy for your audience.

# 6. Boosts Productivity

Instead of spending hours on tedious link verification, you can focus on what you do best—creating amazing content or building powerful web features. Let the tool handle the grunt work while you tackle more meaningful tasks.

In short, a broken link checker isn’t just a convenience—it’s a smart investment in your workflow. Whether you blog for fun or develop for clients, it's a must-have tool to save time, improve quality, and keep your digital space in top shape.",1,1761904546.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

1okqc9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/1okqc9b/agritrace_systems/,Agritrace Systems,"This week we at the Ghana Commodity Exchange  trading Labs explored a domain of agricultural traceability that is offline-first, blockchain-free, yet still cryptographically verifiable—aimed squarely at cash crops (cocoa, cashew, coffee, shea). The core idea: bind each physical bag to a digital twin using an optical PUF (bag-as-a-key), capture events with TEE-attested devices, enforce conservation with ZK mass-balance on a merge/split hypergraph, and publish roots into a certificate-transparency-style mesh of cross-signed logs. No tokenomics, no global chain—just verifiable math and cheap hardware.

This solves 
• Unclonable identity: optical-PUF + fuzzy extractor → stable secret R per bag.
• Trustable capture: device keys in StrongBox/SE/TPM sign intake/hand-offs.
• Privacy-preserving correctness: Pedersen-committed weights/moisture with ZK proofs that inputs == outputs ± loss bounds—without revealing business numbers.
• Auditability without a chain: Merkle-logged snapshots with cross-witnessed STHs.
• Rural-ready: custody tokens work offline; reconcile later to kill double-spends.



// Minimal flow: PUF → fuzzy Rep → Pedersen commits → Merkle leaf → TEE attested event
// (Conceptual)

    let H = RistrettoPoint::hash_from_bytes::<blake3::Hasher>(b""H"");
    (Scalar::from(m)*G + r*H, r)

    *hash(&xored).as_bytes()
}

fn main() {
    // 1) Optical-PUF re-scan on bag intake
    let R = fuzzy_rep(&helper_w, &puf_rescan_bits);        // bag secret (stable)

   
    let (c_mass, r_mass)   = pedersen(62_500);             // grams (hidden)
    let (c_moist, r_moist) = pedersen(890);                // basis points (hidden)

 
    let bag_meta = b""cocoa|Wenchi|2025-10-29"";

1okqc6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimNikah/comments/1okqc6d/feeling_disheartened_by_the_kind_of_marriage/,Feeling disheartened by the kind of marriage proposals my parents keep bringing me,"I’m in my early thirties and lately I’ve been struggling with the type of men being recommended to me through family connections. It started in my mid twenties. I kept the disappointment in my heart with the hope it will become better in the future, but I have no hopes anymore. I don’t mean to sound arrogant, but I hope other women can relate to what I’m saying.

I’m a well-educated woman with a master’s degree in engineering, financially stable with good savings and I take care of myself inside and out. I have a classic, feminine style, a slim physique, exercise regularly and I value good manners, emotional intelligence, ambition and stability. I also have an expensive taste and enjoy nice things, but I’m also grounded and down to earth.

Most of the “proposals” I get are through my parents’ friends or acquaintances - basically, whenever my mom chats with someone and they ask if I’m married yet, they suddenly “know a guy.” But it always ends up being someone completely incompatible - even look wise. Yes, physical attraction is important in marriage and everyone who says otherwise is straight up lying. Many of these men are way below the level of maturity, stability and ambition I’d expect from a partner at this stage in life. I know the older a woman becomes, the smaller the pool of men gets as woman usually look for someone older more accomplished, but I also get proposals from younger men as well. Not to brag here- quite the contrary. 

To give examples:
-Some are younger than me-still students or recently graduated and have zero savings or work experience.
-Some rely entirely on their parents for money.
-Some don’t have permanent residency where they live or even speak the local language properly.
-Some are refugees.
-Others are looking for a wife in a different country despite them living elsewhere. They still haven’t figured out where they want to settle.
-Others are in their late 30s or 40s but still don’t have a driver’s license, a car, a stable career, savings, goals, self esteem etc.
-A few openly admitted they have no real expectations for what kind of woman they want, they’re just happy if anyone shows interest. 
-Some have extremely low self confidence that makes someone go mad. 
I can go on and on.

After hearing recommendations like these over and over, I’ve started questioning myself. I can’t help but think: Can’t my parents see my worth? Don’t they see the kind of woman they raised? I’ve worked hard on myself, my education, my independence, everything. It hurts to see that my own family seems fine with presenting men who don’t align with the life I’ve built - not even in a slightest way. If I was a mom of a daughter like me and someone recommended her these kind of men, I would straight up tell her with no shame that my daughter deserves only the best, and those people she recommends, she wouldn’t even accept them for her own self. Sometimes I feel like these aunties don’t like to see other family’s daughters winning. Usually these kind of men got rejected by their friends daughters or even their own daughters for whatever reasons and think I would accept them for myself due to my age.

I’ve tried to explain my standards to my parents in the past what kind of man I’d actually want to marry but it doesn’t seem to matter. My mom thinks that if she starts turning people down or setting standards, no one will recommend anyone anymore, because what I want is too high. In reality it isn’t. It’s because they aren’t social at all and always move in the same circles that have low quality men. But honestly, I’d rather get  no proposals than keep being offered men who are completely wrong for me. I also noticed whenever I get a proposal from a someone who’s family isn’t rich, my parents feel so sorry for him and find it inappropriate to not give this guy a chance, because in their minds the poorer the people are the more well behaved and religious they are and vice versa. When someone with money is presented to me, they become careful assuming his money is earned in a haram way, sometimes my dad treats him in a way to keep him grounded by changing his tone or belittle his accomplishments. 

And before anyone asks why I don’t just find someone myself - I tried. But my parents made a huge issue out of it, saying that meeting men in public would “ruin my reputation.” Apparently, if someone saw me having coffee with a guy, they’d assume something inappropriate.

It’s just exhausting and disheartening. I’m not asking for perfection - even if it sounded like that - just for someone on my level who shares similar values, ambition, and lifestyle. But the way things are going, I feel like I’m being set up to settle for less than I deserve, and it’s really affecting my confidence. 

Alhamdulilah, I will be moving out of my parents home tomorrow to begin a new life away from their disrespect and dehumanizations. They are so delusional, unfair and contradicting with lots of double standards. They made such a high effort searching for a good beautiful woman for their son because that’s what he wanted, but me…? Im trash for them. It’s painful. And even more when they constantly preach about religion and good manners while they can’t act according to it.",2,1761904429.0,MuslimNikah,0,1.0,False

1okqbea,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1okqbea,First Kobe Beef Experience in Kyoto,"Currently in Japan and booked a last minute resveration to Kobe Beef Steak Mouriya in Gion. Ate there at 11:30 am by myself and ordered the premium serlion (A5) at 150g, which starts at ¥25,000/$163.

First off, the this is my first Kobe beef experience. And it was the best meal I've had so far in Japan. Since I was the only one, I had the entire section to myself and had my own individual chef who spoke English very well. 

There were 3 cuts I was given (sorry don't remember the names). For the first one, the chef asked me how I'd like it cook, to which I responded medium rare. But then I asked him how he recommends it and he told me medium so I just followed his advice. 2nd cut I went with medium rare and 3rd back to medium. 

Honestly, with all 3 cuts each piece of steak melted in my mouth. There were condiments there for the apps and veggies. I asked what's the best condiment he recommends for the steak and he said wasabi and another one (forgot the name too 😭) and that was all I used. 

Everything was GREAT. Would def come back here just for this restaurant (they first location is in Kobe). Total was $176 cuz I had 1 drink. The meal comes with apps, soup, veggies, drink (tea or coffee) and dessert. Everything 10/10. ",1,1761904342.0,steak,1,0.67,False

I’ve been on Buprinon 300mg for about 9 months now. Never had any side effects at all, it’s been great for me overall.

But yesterday I opened a new box (same brand and dosage) and took my pill with my morning croissant and coffee like I always do. Within an hour or so, things got absolutely crazy. I felt like I’d taken a full line of something really bad 😅 My body was buzzing, I couldn’t stop moving, my hands were jittery, I couldn’t focus or even blink properly. Like after a dancing drug but a really strong one? 

It’s been over a day and I can still feel it. My appetite vanished completely, though I forced one meal down.

I’ve never experienced anything even remotely like this before. Could this be a bad batch? Or maybe a manufacturing issue with this lot?

1okq97l,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1okq97l/why_doing_things_last_minute_isnt_worth_it/,Why doing things last minute isn't worth it,"I know a lot of us think we work better under pressure. Without a deadline looming, we find it hard to even situate our tasks in time, and make a plan for them. However according to my subjective opinion it's not worth it. 

1. Our estimation for how long something takes is usually way off. As we hastily work on our task, many unknowns and contingencies pop up that we couldn't have predicted. Working on your task and those additional problems is stretching your time to its limit. The result is less than what we could have been capable of, fueling our low self esteem. 

2. Taking regular breaks while working is important for people like us, but there's no room for that on a time crunch. 

3. Once we have finished our work, the stress of doing that (especially multiple times) finally takes its toll on us. ADHD patients are sensitive to burnout, and the coffee/red bulls we were pounding definitely did not help. The burnout could be so bad it leaves us unable to return to regular tasks. 

I know someone will reply that they completed an amazing thesis within a week, or something similar, but most of us are not operating on that level. 

Do I have a solution to this? Not really. I guess all I can say is try move the ""start point"" of your ""last minute"" a bit earlier, over-estimate how much time it will take, and plan ahead as much as possible.

I'm trying to get my dad (78, retired, generally groovy) off of Mr. Coffee. he's started the work for me, as he has an itty bitty machine he keeps in his RV that he absolutely fell in love with during a recent four-month cross country trek. it was small enough for him to stash in the oven while driving, although I have no idea where he stashed the pods. but he seemed to really enjoy it. 

thing is, as soon as he got home it was right back to drip. problem is... his coffee sucks. like, Nick Yemana level sucks. it vacillates between way too strong to basically nothing at all. he refuses to use any kind of scoop or measuring device, so you never know what you're gonna get.

anyways, back to my point. I'd like to get him a K-cup machine that is a) easy to use, and b) easy to maintain. the latter is where an issue comes into play. when it comes to maintenance, he's SUPER type-A. even if the RV wasn't moving, every time he used his Keurig he'd empty the water reservoir and hand-wash it, even though he'd filled it 10 minutes earlier. TBH it's kind of maddening to watch, but that's just how he do. he's survived 78 years on this earth though, so I'm not gonna judge him too harshly. 

my issue is that I have absolutely no idea what kind/brand/style machine to get him - there are just too many options. I'd describe his counter size as medium, but there could be a Mr. Coffee sized hole opening up if this works. he drinks 2-3 cups per day, medium strength. aesthetics are an issue. taste is, apparently, not. but if it's at all possible I'd like to help him level up his game a little bit.

It is/ was working very well. I never use the steam pipe, because i mostly only drinks espresso’s. After using the steam pipe last week, there was no water coming out from the brew head anymore. First I thought there was air in the system, but that wasn’t the problem. Somebody told met it would be the solenoid valve, that was probably blocked by some scale or debris like grease. I bought a back-flush filter and cleaned the system. Afterwards there was water coming out from the brew head again. Problem solved, I thought. But after I tried the steam pipe again (couldn’t resist it), same problem... This time, flicking the coffee button a couple of times did the trick (?), but I’m still confused of what’s the problem here…

As to my understanding, the solenoid valve is a vulnerable thing. It makes sense to me that it is not working properly when there is water coming out from the steam pipe, but not from the group head. But here is the thing. Why would the solenoid valve be disfunctioning AFTER using the steam pipe? These are two separate systems, right? Is it possible that I using it the wrong way?

Some other questions, while I am at it: 
- Is there always water in the boiler? Should you let run some water through the system every day before using? And also what about when you are on vacation? You should let the boiler be filled with water?
- What about descaling the machine? I am using a descale filter in the water reservoir (and before I used filtered water by Brita), so I think it wouldn’t be necessary? Someone at the coffee store told me that descale products are very bad for the machine, because they are very aggressive… Do you think you should do this, even with filtered water?",1,1761903943.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False

She’s in her 60s and divorced my dad almost 30 years ago, but she remains convinced that every person who takes even a platonic interest in her wants to have a relationship with her.

I called her yesterday evening after I’d had an initial research interview with a BBC producer about a unique story I uncovered on Ancestry while researching my family tree. I’m not a professional genealogist, which makes the discovery all the more surprising given the depth of research and the time it took to find it.

I gave her a call after I had this research interview yesterday evening and told her about it, but I’d barely said two sentences before she hijacked the conversation and trailed off for 45 minutes about her latest ‘boyfriend’ she’s met at church, complete with all the red flags.

**“He’s playing hard to get but I know he wants me!”**

**“Other members of the congregation told me to stay away from him but they’re just jealous!”**

**“I don’t know why he keeps avoiding me! When he saw me he turned away and pretended he didn’t see me but he made eye contact with me!”**

He’s not her ‘boyfriend’.

They’ve never met outside of church, and he won’t give her his phone number.

I’m sat on the sofa listing to her ramble on about him. I put my phone on the coffee table for a couple of minutes as I’m sat on the sofa with my wife and we both made eye contact as if to say “How long is she going to talk for?”.

After looking at other mini PC reviews, I finally bought the GEEKOM IT13 with the I9-13900HK. It was a bit unexpected, slightly faster than my old computer and incredibly compact. It sits on my desk beside my anime figurines and coffee mug, leaving half the surface free. As a 3D artist, I need powerful performance, and this mini PC's graphics card delivers perfectly. I run Maya modeling, Photoshop texture adjustments, and rendering tasks simultaneously with zero lag or stuttering. Plus, it supports four monitors. One screen handles model detail adjustments, another displays lighting references, while the remaining two are dedicated to real-time render previews. My productivity has skyrocketed. What I love most is its near-silent operation. It's so quiet I sometimes forget it's even running. It never interrupts my creative flow anymore, and when I pull all-nighters on projects, it doesn't disturb others. It's truly saved my workflow.",1,1761903612.0,computers,0,1.0,False

What it does:

* Full-text search on bookmark folders to quickly save the current page in the right place
* Shows complete folder paths so you know exactly where you're saving
* Detects duplicate bookmarks, shows where they already exist, and lets you delete them directly
* Dark mode support

1okq3dw,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1okq3dw/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1okpyun,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutsourceDevHub/comments/1okpyun/how_smart_data_platforms_are_learning_to_talk_back/,How Smart Data Platforms Are Learning to Talk Back,"Remember when talking to your data meant writing a 200-line SQL query, praying it didn’t return NULL, and waiting for the database to either crash or give you a sad CSV? Yeah — those were the days. Now, we’re living in a world where you can literally ask your data questions in plain English (or any language you fancy), and it responds with instant insights, graphs, or even suggestions you didn’t ask for.

Welcome to the new era of **AI-powered, conversational data platforms** — systems that don’t just store or process information, but actually *understand* it, *contextualize* it, and *talk back*.

And in fields like **healthcare**, this is transforming how analytics, diagnostics, and decision-making happen in real time.

# The Data Whisperers: AI and ML in Conversation Mode

At the core of this transformation lies a beautiful cocktail: **large language models (LLMs)** \+ **real-time data streaming** \+ **domain-specific training**.

Think of it this way: traditional data analytics was like ordering at a restaurant using a form — precise, structured, unforgiving. AI-driven data platforms are like chatting with the chef directly. You say, “Something spicy, but not too spicy, and maybe with tofu?” and somehow you get exactly what you wanted.

This happens because AI models embedded in modern BI tools (like Databricks’ Genie, Snowflake’s Cortex, or Google’s Gemini for BigQuery) now interpret **natural language as code**. Underneath, they’re quietly generating SQL, optimizing queries, and fetching from streaming datasets while you sip your coffee.

They apply **ML-powered context matching**, meaning they understand that “patient readmission” relates to “discharge events,” or that “heart rate spike” and “tachycardia” are clinically linked.

It’s *vibe coding vs traditional coding*: instead of manually constructing logic, you just describe the outcome and let the platform vibe with your intent.

# Real-Time Analytics: From Static Dashboards to Dynamic Conversations

In healthcare, every second counts. Traditional dashboards — even the prettiest Tableau visualizations — often run on *yesterday’s data*.

Real-time analytics changes the game. Data streams from medical devices, lab systems, and hospital ERPs feed directly into a live processing layer (Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming, or Google Dataflow). Then, **AI models continuously learn** from that stream, detecting anomalies, predicting outcomes, and even suggesting interventions.

Here’s where it gets wild: clinicians can now literally ask,

>“How many ICU beds are free right now?”  
“Show me patients whose oxygen saturation is dropping below 90%.”

And the system answers. No dashboards, no pivot tables — just a conversation.

It’s the difference between watching a recorded surgery and assisting in a live one.

# The Rise of Conversational BI: When Data Feels Alive

Conversational BI (Business Intelligence) isn’t just a new UI trend — it’s a **paradigm shift**.

By layering **LLM-powered NLQ (Natural Language Query)** on top of analytics tools, even non-technical users can interact with their data instantly. The system translates a human query like *“compare patient recovery times in Q2 vs Q3”* into a structured query, fetches the data, and returns a clear visualization — sometimes even explaining its reasoning.

Developers, on the other hand, can take it up a notch: combining AI-generated queries with their own **regex-powered data validation** scripts to make sure the model doesn’t “hallucinate” metrics. Think of it as having a junior analyst who’s fast, clever, but needs a strict validator (`/[\d\.]+%/` to catch those mysterious percentage anomalies).

Abto Software, for example, has been integrating **AI-assisted analytics** into healthcare data platforms to make hospital workflows smarter and safer — not just more efficient. This isn’t automation for its own sake; it’s intelligence with empathy.

# Predictive Meets Prescriptive: When AI Stops Waiting for Questions

The next evolution of “talking to your data” is your data talking to *you*.

We’re already seeing this in pilot systems where AI models proactively alert clinicians or administrators. Instead of you asking, “Which patients are at risk tonight?”, the system might ping you:

>“Three patients show early signs of sepsis. Recommended monitoring intervals increased to every 15 minutes.”

This shift from **reactive to proactive** data interaction is where ML’s predictive power truly shines. Add real-time analytics, and it’s like having a digital co-pilot for decision-making.

What’s even more fascinating is how some systems are learning **tone and intent** — they can gauge whether you’re asking for a quick overview or a deep dive, optimizing their response speed and detail accordingly. It’s not just intelligent; it’s *contextually polite*.

# The AI Data Stack Is Getting a Personality

Developers are now embedding **semantic memory layers** into data platforms, so that the system “remembers” previous queries, results, and preferences.

Ask it once about “cardiology trends,” and the next time you say “same as before, but for oncology,” it knows what you mean.

This creates an almost human-like conversational continuity that feels natural — but under the hood, it’s a combination of vector embeddings, query caching, and reinforcement learning.

In other words, your data platform is slowly turning into that one colleague who remembers every meeting and never forgets a Jira ticket. Slightly terrifying, but undeniably useful.

# Beyond Healthcare: A Template for Every Industry

While healthcare is the poster child for this transformation (given its data intensity and real-time needs), these innovations are spreading fast.

Manufacturing systems that talk back about equipment efficiency, finance platforms that explain portfolio risks in plain text, logistics platforms that answer “where’s my container right now?” — all powered by **AI-driven, conversational data layers**.

Each use case reinforces the same idea: data isn’t a static resource anymore. It’s a responsive, evolving dialogue partner.

# Final Thoughts: Your Data Platform Wants to Talk. Will You Listen?

Here’s the kicker — these innovations aren’t about replacing developers or analysts. They’re about making every interaction with data faster, friendlier, and more human.

The new generation of platforms turns analytics into a dialogue, not a report. It’s as if your database suddenly learned small talk — only instead of gossip, it delivers KPIs.

And maybe, just maybe, the next time you’re debugging a dashboard, you’ll hear your data whisper:

>“You forgot the WHERE clause again, didn’t you?”

When that happens, you’ll know we’ve arrived.

AI/ML and real-time analytics are giving rise to data platforms that you can literally *talk to*. Healthcare is leading the charge, where real-time patient monitoring meets conversational intelligence. As models evolve, they’re not just answering questions — they’re asking better ones back.",1,1761903001.0,OutsourceDevHub,0,1.0,False

Yeah… I wanted to see what really happens when POW EA starts crunching numbers for hours.



# The setup

* **Machine 1:** “Cloud VPS” with Xeon Gold 6248R @ 3.0 GHz, 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, shared NVMe (somewhere in “the cloud”).
* **Machine 2:** Dedicated AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D, 16 cores / 32 threads, 5.7 GHz boost, 128 MB L3, real NVMe under my desk-in-a-datacenter. Both running MT5, same POW EA build, same dataset, same broker feed.



# The result

* VPS: **\~7 hours 12 min** for full optimization run.
* Ryzen 7950X3D: **1 hour 54 min**. Same task. No fairy dust. Just physics.

The cloud box looked fine on paper, but those “vCPUs” turned out to be like shared scooters -great until five people grab the throttle at once.



# Why such a gap?

MetaTrader’s tester loves raw frequency and cache.  
The Ryzen X3D’s 3D V-Cache gives it a buffet of data right next to the cores, while the VPS CPU keeps begging its hypervisor for another bite of RAM.

Also: zero virtualization overhead, no noisy neighbors, and the NVMe actually runs at NVMe speeds instead of “mystery network storage 200 MB/s edition”.



# TL;DR

POW EA on real hardware simply **flies**.  
Cloud VPS? Feels like running a marathon in flip-flops.

If you’re serious about testing or live algo trading - get yourself a dedicated box with a Ryzen 9 7950X3D.

I brush off the body’s fog and stand after the rain.
The word I left was “thank you.”
It feels like that wasn’t what I truly wanted to say.

I watch the telephone pole’s shadow lengthen.
A brown‑haired girl in an apron stares at a cracked coffee cup.

I go to the town at the bottom of the valley and step on the wet pavement.
An old man who said, “I was driven here, but I don’t really know why,” shifts his gaze to the right.
Where did he turn, what did he look at.
His gaze lands on the bus stop.

“The time must be yesterday,” said someone who’d been fired and was toying with ice at a bar.

Your story that “love is over.”
Who was even there in that scene.

A woman I had just met was furious.
“Are you the one? You wouldn’t be kind to me as when we met, and I cried.
Have you moved on to another woman. Can’t you even keep the early promises,” she pressed.
When I answered, “I don’t mind; whoever the partner is, it could be you,”
you smashed a plate through tears and tried to cut the curtain with scissors.
Unable to cut it, an angry woman stepped in; when it finally parted, the two of you rejoiced.
Who were they.

Then I learned that hardship can save sorrow.
The word that came out was “thank you,” but I think it was taken to mean something else.

After that you put down the scissors and came at me with a butter knife,
but I shouldn’t have dodged it.
It wouldn’t have been a serious wound; I could have taken it, shown a little blood,
made you say even a single “I’m sorry,” and the future might have shifted.
I was the one who avoided it.

I couldn’t receive your kindness.
I felt sorry and realized my vessel goes only so far.
Even knowing that, in a similar moment I’d probably dodge again.
My life changed. I learned I cannot hold kindness.

Knowing it doesn’t make me want to improve.
You often said, “If there’s anything bad, tell me. I’ll fix what makes you uncomfortable.”
I appreciated that, but comfort and discomfort change by the day, so I kept quiet.
If I must say something, your socks left on the floor smelled a bit,
but that’s a matter of constitution; nothing to be done.

What does “improvement” point to, in the end.
Trying to know it, we add useless words and acts,
and eventually reach the valley town and turn right.
What will we be looking at then.
What will we feel; how will we live it through.
I turn right. Only time moves on.

Commentary Poem 


After‑rain air holds to the skin. A cracked cup brightens the ragged edge of a day.
A bus stop fixes the gaze that keeps slipping right.
Anger breaks a plate, slips on cloth, then finds purchase; the room cheers when the fabric finally parts.
I learned the hard thing: certain griefs are saved by a harder shape.
A butter knife will not carve a future, yet a drop of blood might have opened a hinge toward apology.
I dodged; the door stayed shut.
Kindness, when I cannot hold it, bruises duller than steel.
The word “thank you” remains, not as a ribbon but as weight.
We name it “improvement” and try to measure each other; the measure spills.
Socks left on the floor keep their small truth.
I face right; the schedule carries yesterday; time goes on without us.
Silence is not outside; it rises and expires in the body, stroke by stroke.

1okpwu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RitaFourEssenceSystem/comments/1okpwu1/coming_back_to_sapphire_with_a_different/,"Coming back to Sapphire, with a different understanding","About a month ago, I decided to switch quadrants & to work with Moonstone (I was verified Sapphire in 2023). I struggled with RU, I did not find my place, I overthought everything and made myself miserable - I was not enough, I was too much, *woe is me*. The drama alone should have been a clue tbh.

Anyway, it was a great time. I experimented, I made a few purchases (which were more instinctive but still framed in terms of complete outfits), gave away a few items that I don't wear or don't make me feel good for some reason, had ups and downs, but overall I had fun. Re-centering my process on myself instead of what I think I should wear was very freeing and, I think, a much needed break. It also made me think of Kibbe and I gave away a few items that I bought bc they fit an ID that I may or may not be - but they did not fit \*me\*.

It came to me one day when I was making coffee for the gardeners at my workplace. I prepared it exactly like I would for clients: a nice tray with china and a pot of colorful packets of sugar. My coworker remarked that I could have given them plastic cups, and my first thought was 'well, no, why wouldn't they get pretty things too?' - I like to treat everyone the same, and I like to make people feel seen, important, and most of all: \*give them joy\*.

That was quite a light bulb moment. I don't really care what people think of \*me\* per se, that is not the kind of impact I'm seeking, I care what I bring to the situation, how I make people feel, how I can be of service to them. Sometimes there are difficult situations where I have to be more attentive to my own needs & the support I might require, but most days it's about communicating joy & seeking togetherness in an increasingly divided world. I felt stuck in RU bc, I think, I was trying to make it about my image and it's not something I do very well or that makes me feel good. It also explains my frankly weird obsession with Princess Catherine's looks - I obviously don't have her budget or her lifestyle & role, ofc, but I'm fascinated by \*how\* she dresses and what message she conveys in which occasion.

I keep on wanting to dress down & have a minimalist capsule wardrobe bc I associate it with values I take to heart, but I realise now that this was misguided. Last week we were away for a few days (family event) and I was finally able to build a travel capsule for 5 days that I loved: 3 fun outfits complete with earrings, a coat that is versatile but interesting, a funky scarf - instead of my usual 'mix & match basics' approach that makes me really sad in the end lol. Kudos to the Style Roots approach: it really helps me (I use Mushroom & Stone pretty instinctively, but keeping in mind to add a Sun touch is so much more satisfying! I think it links pretty well with the playful aspect of my main archetype).

So, there are my current thoughts on style! I know I am difficult and lack confidence, and I'm sorry if I am annoying. I'm sharing on the off chance that someone might benefit from my chronic overthinking :)",9,1761902776.0,RitaFourEssenceSystem,4,1.0,False

A few days ago, this girl I knew from university DM'd me, simply asking, ""Do you have a girlfriend?""

I should note that ""knew"" is a bit much. It's more like I knew of her. We had the same major, shared some classes, and we'd see each other around the campus very frequently, but I struggle to remember if we ever had one conversation. I wouldn't be surprised to find that we actually didn't exchange a single word for that entire length of time at university. So you can imagine my surprise when she sent me that message.

I told her I didn't have a girlfriend and asked why she was asking. She said she was just asking but was glad to know I was single. We engage in a bit of banter, through which she tells me she ""let her intrusive thoughts win"" and ""decided to shoot my shot"" because she's looking to ""make some bold moves before the year ends."" At this point I still want more clarity. You could say it's as simple as she likes me, but again, we barely know each other. Sure, college friend networks and word of mouth could have given her some idea of what I'm like, but A) that idea is gonna be foggy at best, and B) we graduated over a decade ago. I'm a very different person now.

So I try playfully asking her what she's going for with this. What's the target, what's the end goal. Her reply is flustered and she tells me this is her first time trying anything like this and she doesn't know exactly what she's doing. I apologize for putting pressure on her and try to laugh it off to defuse the situation. She eventually tells me she can't give an answer yet. At this point I'm thinking, either she DM'd me on impulse and didn't plan this far ahead, or she's keeping her cards close and wants me to sort of get to the end goal for her (like ask her out or something).

I decide that this is as good a time as any to set things straight. I tell her, ""Thanks for putting up with all my questions. Full transparency, not sure if I'm looking for anything super serious right now. Just wanted to put that out there in case that was something you had in mind."" She tells me she appreciates my transparency and that it ""makes me like you more."" I thank her and ask her to let me know if her intrusive thoughts tell her anything else.

Four days later, she DMs me again asking how my week has been. I tell her I've been dealing with some stomach issues (I have, and it's been a living hell and I fucking hate it). Not wanting to say any more on how my bowels have been beating the shit out of me, I say, ""What's up? Intrusive thoughts say anything new?"" She tells nothing has come to mind and asks me for suggestions. I tell her maybe the thoughts want her to make some more bold moves, to which she responds that she's hit her quota.

At this point, I'm dealing with some small internal conflict. One the one hand, I'm not sure if I want to take things any further. On the other, I'm starting get genuinely curious about what might come out of this whole thing. The way she didn't just bail when I told her I wasn't looking for anything serious gave me the impression we're somewhat on the same page, and I don't really have to worry about unknowingly leading her on. There's also the very real possibility I'm thinking with my little head and not my big one. So... yeah.

I tell her I'd make some bold moves of my own if not for my current physical state (the evil bowels). When she says, ""I'll help you recover,"" I ask her to elaborate, and she jokingly says she's gonna pray for me and asks if I'm cool with that. I then ask if there are other options. She asks me to come up with some for her to choose from, and I say, ""The ones I can think of involve leaving the house, which I can't do yet."" So says she hopes I get better soon, and that we have more days ahead anyway.

If you've read this far, thank you. This is where I need some r/advice. While I think that this could be a fun, or at the very least interesting thing to watch play out, the last thing I want to do is lead her on and have her think this is going somewhere it isn't. I made my position clear already, but I know quite well the power of wishful thinking. Right now I'm thinking I just go for something chill and simple, maybe ask if she wants to get a coffee sometime, but I'm still not exactly sure I want to get this off the ground at all.",2,1761902638.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Most of the advice I read says the coffee ""cup"" should be filled completely (but not tapped). I tried lowering the level to about 60-70%. The image shows my two latest experiments. The left is with the full cup, the right with fewer coffee grounds. I really like the texture and thickness of the left one, but it was way bitter.

Am I over-extracting, or am I using too many coffee grounds? Is it supposed to look like the left or the right one?

And yes, I'm using pre-heated water. I usually heat in level 4 (from 1-9) until the coffee starts coming out, then lower it to 3. Sometimes it seems the flow is too slow and not continuous. But when I increase it, it begins spluttering too easily.",2,1761901856.0,mokapot,2,1.0,False

Seven seconds later, I’d be deep in a battle for my machine’s very soul.



I downloaded Norton’s official removal tool, ran it, watched the progress bar flicker, and in *seven seconds flat* it proudly declared “Success.” Seven seconds? For a program that burrows deeper than the March Hare? I knew something was off.



Sure enough, I checked manually — every file, every service, every trace of Norton still alive and well. Not a single byte removed. *The battle lines were drawn.*



*Round one: Task Manager.*

I hunt down the Norton process, blade in hand (figuratively), and end task. But how is it even running if I just uninstalled it? Logic and reason have left MSoft's campuses — or maybe they were uninstalled too.



Reboots become my war drums. Each restart, a reset of hope. Each failure, a new scar. I try deleting the files manually — denied. “Files in use.” Even as admin. Even in PowerShell. Even with `-Force`. Windows laughs in my face.



So I start trimming, piece by piece, deleting what I can. Thousands fall until only one last file remains — one single, stubborn sentinel. The last line of defense.



Alright, I think, time to bring out the heavy artillery: Safe Mode.

I open `msconfig`, enable Safe Boot, and hit restart. This is it.



The screen fades. “Shutting down…”

Then — black.



One minute passes. Two. Five. Ten. The monitor stares back at me, blank and cold. I brew a coffee — strong, black, and bitter, like the void staring into me. Still nothing.



I try again. Power off. Power on. Repeat. Over and over — twenty, thirty times. My keyboard becomes a battlefield of desperation: Esc, Del, F1 through F12 — I press them all like prayers to long-forgotten gods.



Thirty-seven minutes later — *finally*, a flicker. A boot menu. A sliver of hope.

I press Enter.



And then the screen goes black again. A single message appears like a taunt from the abyss:



>“Network error. Trying again in 30 minutes.”

>“Press Enter to continue.”



I press Enter. Nothing. I click. Nothing. I switch my wireless mouse and keyboard for wired ones — surely this will do it.

Still nothing.



*Ah, that would’ve been too easy against a foe this cunning*. Norton and Windows — a united front, an unholy alliance. I realize then: the reboot is my only option.

A hail mary in the face of shadow.



I shut it down, one final time. The fans spin up. The Windows chime rings. My pulse spikes.

GO. GO. GO.



Safe Mode.

Finally.



I log in, wary. It feels too easy. Like the calm before a trap. But I press on.

In PowerShell, I summon the command one last time:



`Remove-Item "".\IDSvia64.sys"" -Recurse -Force`



One second. Two. Three.

Success.



It’s gone. For real this time. The folder lies slain in the Recycle Bin, vanquished. I empty it without ceremony.



Reboot back into normal mode.

Windows loads. Smoothly. Peacefully.



Victory.



I open Settings → Installed Apps. And there it is —

**Norton 360**.

Silent. Faded. But not gone.



Logic says it shouldn’t be there — not after everything I’ve done.

And yet it lingers, mocking me, like the dying curse of a defeated foe.



I tell myself the war is over.

But deep down, I know better.

Some ghosts refuse to stay buried.



So I sip my coffee and watch the sun rise through the window,

its light creeping across the keys of a machine finally at peace.

The idea of getting something for free taps deep into human behavior. When people see the words bonus or free spins, they feel like they’re already winning. That emotion lowers hesitation and makes clicking “deposit” feel less risky.

Casinos understand this perfectly. A small bonus can make players stay longer, bet a bit more, and feel better about their choices. It’s not a trick, it’s psychology. When someone loses a few spins but then receives a 20% cashback, it softens the sting. The player feels recognized — and that feeling keeps them returning.

When I sleep 7–8 hours straight and avoid late meals, things calm down. I tweaked a few details that seem to matter: 100% cotton and changing underwear right after workouts, no internal douching or direct jet on the vulva, just lukewarm water externally; I cut back on coffee after lunch and leave a 3–4 hour gap between dinner and sleep. I also keep a small journal (food, stress, sleep, symptoms) to see if it's just a feeling or a real pattern.

For overall balance (stress, sleep, sugar cravings) I tried a plant-based formula from Happy Mammoth, used consistently for 30 days; not making medical claims, but combined with gentle hygiene and steadier sleep, my irritating episodes became less frequent. I don't use fragranced products on the vulva, avoid wet wipes, and at the first sign that something is off (fishy odor, thin gray discharge, strong itching) I go for testing instead of random treatment.

1okpdhz,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/05/rupert-murdoch-access-to-downing-street-theresa-may-david-cameron?CMP=twt_gu,🧾 Political Favour Factory | Rupert Murdoch accused of enjoying ‘astounding access’ to Downing Street — the mogul who never needed a key,"Mon 6 Feb 2017

Senior executives from Rupert Murdoch-owned companies met the prime minister or chancellor 10 times in a year – more than any other media organisation, according to a new analysis.

There were 10 meetings with either David Cameron or George Osborne, and later Theresa May or the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, compared with seven with named executives for the BBC and four with Evgeny Lebedev, the owner of the Evening Standard and Independent, over the 12 months to September 2016.

Over an 18-month period, News Corp executives had 20 meetings with senior government representatives. Of these, 18 were with the prime minister, chancellor or culture secretary, and of those, seven involved Murdoch himself . A further eight were with Robert Thomson, the chief executive of News Corp and most senior executive at Murdoch’s newspaper businesses.

Campaigners said it demonstrates the mogul’s “astounding” access to the UK’s political leaders. The 18-month period between April 2015 and September 2016 examined by the Media Reform Coalition and 38 Degrees includes the 2015 general election, when Murdoch’s papers backed the Conservatives, last year’s vote to leave the EU, which Murdoch has publicly welcomed, and the first three months of Theresa May’s government.

Maggie Chao, a campaigner with activist group 38 Degrees, said: “These findings show that Murdoch continues to enjoy astounding access to senior politicians. But more importantly, they throw into question the government’s – and [culture secretary] Karen Bradley’s – judgment when it comes to the UK’s most powerful media baron.

“Now it’s up to Karen Bradley to prove she’s on the public’s side – not Murdoch’s – by ensuring the Sky deal is subject to the highest levels of scrutiny.”

The bulk of the meetings with Murdoch and his senior executives were with Cameron, Osborne or other minsters under the previous government. However, since becoming prime minister, May has met Thomson twice and Murdoch once, the latter at the Wall Street Journal in New York.

She also had lunch with an unnamed News Corp executive in May 2016 when she was home secretary. Thomson also held meetings with Bradley and Hammond in September.


The full list of 20 meetings over 18 months does not include numerous meetings between ministers or officials and staff working for Murdoch’s papers, the Sun, Times and Sunday Times, including the title’s editors. However, it does count two meetings, one with 21st Century Fox and another with News Corp, where the name of the executives is not listed.

The analysis does not count a small number of meetings with the BBC where no name is given. They are not thought to have involved senior executives.

The meeting with 21st Century Fox, the TV and film company that was separated from News Corp in 2013 and is now run by Murdoch’s son James, took place in January last year with John Whittingdale, the then culture secretary.

In December, Fox announced it was making a bid to acquire the remaining 61% of UK satellite broadcaster Sky that it does not already own. Bradley, Whittingdale’s replacement, who met News Corp’s Thomson in September, will be called on to decide whether to refer the deal to regulators.

The analysis also found six meetings with Sky, all but one of which was with ministers then working for the culture department Bradley now runs. However, Bradley, who was made culture secretary last July, is not listed as having met Sky representatives during the period covered.

News Corp declined to comment.

A government spokesperson said: “Ministers meet with a range of stakeholders. We publish the details of these meetings in our transparency returns.”

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Boston Celtics vs. Philadelphia 76ers: A Tale of Three-Pointers, Baby-Faced Aces, and Why Philadelphia’s Defense Feels Like a Sieve**

The Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers collide on Halloween, and if this game had a theme, it’d be “Trick or Treat, Smack in the Street.” The Celtics, fresh off a 20-point drubbing of the Cavaliers, are looking to avenge their season-opening loss to the 76ers, while Philly—despite a flawless 4-0 start—carries the ghost of last season’s offensive woes like a cursed Halloween costume. Let’s break this down with the statistical rigor of a tax auditor and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s had one too many pumpkin spice lattes.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Real Boos in This Town?

The 76ers enter as 3-point favorites, but their odds (implied probability of \~55% via -150 lines) might be inflating their actual chances. Why? Let’s crunch the numbers:

* **Boston’s Defense**: The Celtics are **second in the NBA in points allowed (107.2 PPG)** and **fourth in defensive efficiency (106.4 points per 100 possessions)**. They’ve turned their arena into a prison for opposing offenses, and Philadelphia’s historically porous defense (21st in points allowed last season) makes them prime targets for Boston’s suffocating D.
* **Three-Point Mayhem**: Boston is **fourth in the league in 3s made (16.0 per game)**, even if their accuracy (33.1%) is worse than a toddler shooting a basketball with a Nerf gun. Meanwhile, Philly ranks **21st in 3s made (12.7 per game)** and relies on Tyrese Maxey’s 33.7% shooting from deep—a stat that whispers “clutch” but screams “random hot streak.”
* **Scoring Differential**: Boston’s +35 differential is like a superhero’s secret weapon, while Philly’s 109.6 PPG (5th-worst last season) feels like a team that still thinks “transition” is a type of coffee.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Depth, and Why Philly’s Big Men Are MIA

The 76ers are playing with house money without **Joel Embiid** (injured) and **Paul George** (sidelined), relying on **VJ Edgecombe** (22.3 PPG) to fill

Don’t get me wrong - 4K is beautiful. But the difference between 4K and 1080p feels less like a visual leap and more like a tech-induced migraine.

Let's begin with the dull basics:

* **1080p (Full HD)** → 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. Clean, compact, easy to edit even on a mid-range laptop.
* **4K (Ultra HD)** → 3,840 x 2,160 pixels. Four times the data. Four times the pain if your machine isn’t ready for it.

I once decided to edit a short travel vlog in 4K because “it would look more cinematic”. Spoiler: it didn’t. It looked *frozen.* My preview window turned into a slideshow. I spent more time watching progress bars than footage. Eventually, I downscaled everything to 1080p and suddenly - smooth playback, quick exports, and no more fan screaming like a jet engine.

Here’s what I’ve realized after hours (and hours) of messing around in Premiere, DaVinci, and Resolve Lite clones:

**4K eats hardware alive.** You need more RAM, better GPU, faster storage - and still, sometimes it lags like it’s mocking you.  
**1080p workflows are pure bliss.** You can scrub, cut, color-correct, and export without feeling like you’re doing rocket science.  
**Scaling matters.** If you’re shooting in 4K and exporting to 1080p, you actually get sharper, cleaner footage. It’s called *oversampling*, and it’s like cheating your way to better quality.

What nobody tells you when you first start editing is that 4K’s not just “more pixels”. It’s heavier codecs, longer render times, and file sizes that make your SSD cry for mercy. A five-minute 4K movie can consume more storage space than a full season of your favorite show in 1080p.

But I won't lie: when it works, 4K looks stunning. The sharpness, color richness, and way microscopic details stand out are all captivating. Once you’ve seen your footage in full UHD glory, 1080p starts to feel like looking through a window that needs cleaning.

Still, practicality wins most of the time. I’ve seen seasoned editors with 4K cameras who *still* export in 1080p because clients can’t tell the difference on their phones anyway. Meanwhile, YouTube compresses everything to the point that your “8 million pixel masterpiece” becomes a slightly sharper blur.

My personal workflow now looks like this:

* I shoot in 4K (for flexibility).
* I edit and preview in 1080p (for sanity).
* I export in whatever my client’s monitor - or their internet connection - can handle.

The truth? 4K makes sense if you're editing professionally, working on enormous displays, or wish to trim, zoom, and maintain detail. However, whether you're simply creating YouTube videos, streaming gaming, or putting together a birthday montage, 1080p saves time, space, and your mental health. 

And let’s not forget *render times*. My friend once rendered a 12-minute 4K video overnight. The next morning, it was still at 84%. Meanwhile, my 1080p version exported in the time it took me to make coffee. You tell me which one’s better.

So here’s the short version for anyone stuck in resolution limbo:

**1080p** → Smooth editing, smaller files, faster exports. Great for streaming, gaming, and most projects under the sun.  
**4K** → More detail, flexibility in post-production, future-proofing. Ideal for big screens, pro work, and pain-tolerant editors.  
**Compromise:** Shoot in 4K, edit in 1080p. Keep your sanity and your storage.

At the end of the day, the difference between 4k and 1080p boils down to one question: do you want to gaze at pixels or finish your job by sunrise*?* Because trust me, after your fifth render crash, “crisp visuals” stop feeling worth it real fast.

What do you think, guys? Is 4K worth the death of your hardware?

of junior year in college right now. I am having a lot of trouble finding friends who I can be my self around at school and I feel like there's something wrong with me. I wish people understood me, or didn't make assumptions about me or talk about me behind my back, and I feel like I've lost so much confidence since I came to college. I genuinely will look back at memories from high school and even middle school and I seemed to like myself more and that's saying a lot because I've always hated myself. I try my best in school but it's so difficult to focus and my school is very fast paced/ known for being difficult (not going to say for obvious reasons) but I am so far from my home and friends and I feel so lost. On top of that my father is currently battling cancer and he's having a life crisis. He moved out and left my mom and he's acting even meaner then he usually is. All he wants me to do is be a perfect robot maid and do everything he says, never have my own opinions or thoughts but also he wants me to speak to him with warmth, not be sad, never cry(he yells and says im manipulating him EVERY TIME I CRY. Ever since I was a kid, even if I'm crying because he's screaming at me, threatening me, calling me a bitch, crazy bitch, throwing things at me, etc. Every time I've come home from school something has gone wrong. He kicked me out the first break I had when I was a freshman because I asked him to not scream at me all the time and he hit me and threw all my stuff, broke some of my picture frames. I just don't want to be yelled at anymore. He's yelled at me my whole life and he doesn't hit me a lot so I guess that's fine but I don't understand why parents get to disrespect you forever and you can never say anything. I am a person too. And this was before the cancer BTW... I feel terrible for him, I don't want him to be sick. He has worked hard to take care of his health, he eats very well and works out and does all the right things yet he still got sick. It's not fair at all. But to be honest he has rarely ever treated me fairly, and it is difficult coming to terms with that, we have a tumultuous relationship that used to be better, in high school I feel like we could have fun together between the struggles but now it's just so bleak. I think the thing that really broke my faith in him was when I had a suicide attempt last year. I have been so stressed at school, I had friends but they kind of ditched me for this girl they claimed they hated and would always ignore me for her then come hang out with me like every 2 weeks and complain about her. That obviously made me feel like shit because why would they rather hang out with a girl they don't like than me? Anyway I told my parents I had been struggling with my friendships at school and my dad said it was my fault and all this other hurtful shit. He said I am a bad kid because I cut(I hadnt cut in almost a year at that point and I had been in therapy working on trying not to SH again) Anyway I was sleeping in the living room(my 30 year old brother took my bedroom because he's a guest and deserves the full bed"" and my dad came in at like 5 am to start loudly grinding his coffee (kitchen is in the same room no walls) I had gone to bed at like 12 AM because my dad had been watching tv in the living room and i had nowhere to sleep. Obviously the coffee grinder woke me up and I said I was very sleepy, especially because he knew I A) was on my period (i have 9 day, painful periods due to a hormonal imbalance and I had thrown up from cramp pain the previous day) and B) I never slept at school because I was as constantly working on HW or one of my 3 jobs to pay tuition(he doesnt help me pay tuition at all which is fine ig but he has the means to and he helped my brother so it's kinda bogus but whatever) anyway I just was so fed up I tried to leave the apartment and he refused, grabbed my stuff and dumped it all out AGAIN and tried to take ny phone(I paid for... used) and laptop(free from my school) which I obviously was not gonna let him do... Anyway I just was so tired and fed up and needing control and I wanted to escape him so badly because he was screaming and I was so overwhelmed so I went to the kitchen and just started slicing away at my wrist. Anyway once he saw he threatened to call the police on me and say I was threatening him(I assure y'all I was NOT I would never hurt anyone but myself. EVER) which is terrifying as a black girl dealing with a mental health crisis (for obvious reasons) and screamed at me while I was bleeding. Earlier that day I had asked him why he's so mean to me because I think I am a good kid, or at least I try to be. I got into a really good university and I have a great GPA, I volunteer, I run 2 student groups, I always clean up after him and fetch whatever he needs, whenever I come home I try to plan fun activities for us to do as a family, like I'm not saying I'm perfect but I feel like those are good things and I want my parents to be happy. I want the people around me to be happy and I just feel like nobody is happy with me and I am such a burden. I really want to be a good kid, I want him to be proud of me and he just isn't, I feel like he hates me, and I wish I could change whatever is so wrong with me but I don't know how. I want to see him because he's sick, but he's so cruel to me and I just don't know how to handle it, it wasn't always this bad, like he always has been mean but hes been so especially mean since I graduated HS and I have no idea what changed. I am juzt worried because the only times I have seriously tried to kill myself have been because of him and the hostile environment he creates and I really don't want to be alone with him because my mom is often a buffer but since he's away from her now in a completely different state... He's probably too weak to hit me right now though so period lmfao. Not looking for solutions or anything Im just venting and Ill probably delete this but I really don't have that many friends to talk to and I hate being the person who's always sad and always has something wrong. So I don't want to bother them right now. I have to be up in 4 hours for class and my dorm is such a mess right now but today is my favorite holiday so once I purge this sadness out I'm going to do something fun maybe.

Background: When I was 19 I had E. Coli for 3 month period after improper medical care. I wound up at 109 lbs. I have had gnarly GI issues since then. While seeing a gastroenterologist I was diagnosed with fructose and lactose intolerance along with SIBO. I had a normal HIDA scan but did not follow up with an upper endoscopy due to moving states. I took omeprazole on and off and did 3 rounds of Xifaxin over a year and a half.

Present day, I have made a slow but steady recovery and have gone from vomiting most days to once a week, returned to a normal diet and lifestyle. I still have issues with my appetite and nausea, occasional stomach pain, as well as the gnarliest burps you’ve ever heard. Viking stuff. 

I work at a bar and the culture is to drink on shift fairly regularly, I have at least one shot 3 days a week. I have noticed sometimes when I have a shot of straight liquor I usually get sick when I arrive home and often the vomit is a dark color or has black or brown in it. It kind of looks like coffee grounds like they say to look out for, but there is no texture to it. it’s usually bile. 

This has been a consistent issue for over a year now. It used to happen more frequently but I have worked to change habits since noticing the connections. I’d say this happens on average once every six weeks, but I never notice myself feeling any worse than usual after the throwing up event. 

I make an effort not to drink on my off days for balance, but I do smoke weed every day. Otherwise my only daily medication is Birth Control. 

I tend to talk myself out of the idea that I am looking at bloody vomit as I see no red and feel okay. I have been dealing with it for a while and probably won’t go to the ER over it, but I am open to making a primary care appointment, I just need to know I wouldn’t be wasting both our time with hypochondria.

I’m looking for a very large illustrated book (oversized “coffee table” format, with one big illustration per double page).
The text was in French, but I’m pretty sure it was originally English or Dutch. The book existed in thé 90's but I don't know the released year.

The main characters were small gnome-like men, wearing blue tunics, red hats, and striped tights.
They were accompanied by a frog.

In this book they go on an adventure that includes:

- traveling in an airship called Le Bienheureux (“The Blessed One”),

- a submarine (or diving bell) scene with mermaids and mermen,

- the airship crashing in a forest, where pygmies capture them,

- a battle against opponents whose heads are trapped in stone blocks,

- getting captured by pirates,

- and finally bathing near their home in the last scene.


The art style was detailed watercolor, very close to Rien Poortvliet’s work (Gnomes, The Secret Book of Gnomes).
It might actually be a spin-off or sequel to that universe — the characters looked identical to Poortvliet’s gnomes.

Has anyone ever seen this book, or can confirm if there’s a Gnomes-related volume where the airship Le Bienheureux appears?

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

perspectives on life's purpose.

For a multitude of words, the epanalepsis led me through a kaleidoscope of reflections. From the philosophical musings of scholars to the simple yet profound revelations of everyday individuals, each recurrence of the question served as a gateway into the vast tapestry of human contemplation.

Through the epanalepsis, I navigated the labyrinth of existential ponderings, unveiling the unique responses that individuals had forged in their quests for meaning. The relentless repetition became a literary heartbeat, mirroring the universal rhythm of humanity's collective pursuit of purpose and significance.

The narrative wove through the lives of characters, each grappling with the epanaleptic inquiry in their unique ways. Whether seeking solace in the grandeur of the cosmos or finding meaning in the simplicity of a shared moment, the epanalepsis remained a constant companion, echoing the perennial quest for understanding.

**Response to Prompt 36: Anadiplosis**

In the futuristic city of Quantum Heights, where technology intertwined with daily life like a seamless dance, a viral message spread—a mantra that echoed through the cybernetic veins of the metropolis. ""Create the code, the code creates reality. Reality shapes destiny, and destiny is but the code.""

The story unfolded with the rhythmic cadence of anadiplosis, each line flowing into the next, creating a recursive loop of ideas. The mantra became the heartbeat of Quantum Heights, influencing the lives of its denizens as they navigated the intricate balance between the virtual and the tangible.

Through the lens of anadiplosis, I delved into the interconnectedness of code, reality, and destiny. The lines blurred as characters harnessed the power of programming to shape their fates. Quantum Heights, once a mere city, transformed into a living algorithm, where the repetition of the mantra echoed in every pulsating byte.

**Response to Prompt 38: Asyndeton**

In the dystopian city of Emberfall, where the remnants of a fallen civilization lay entwined with the shadows of despair, a lone figure emerged—a rebel determined to dismantle the oppressive regime. The narrative unfolded with the rapid pace of asyndeton, omitting conjunctions to mirror the urgency of the protagonist's quest.

Through a cascade of words, the asyndeton propelled the reader through the city's decaying alleyways and towering citadels, each sentence building upon the last. The disjointed rhythm captured the relentless momentum of the rebel's journey, emphasizing the magnitude of the challenges faced in their struggle for freedom.

As the narrative unfurled, the absence of conjunctions served as a narrative device, intensifying the sense of urgency and desperation that permeated Emberfall. The rebel's asyndetic odyssey unfolded against a backdrop of shattered hopes and whispered rebellions, culminating in a crescendo of defiance against the oppressive regime.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The mantra echoed in the desolate wasteland of Endless Sands, a barren landscape where hope was as scarce as water. Through the repetition of epizeuxis, the protagonist's internal resolve became a resounding anthem, a defiant roar against the relentless challenges of survival.

For a multitude of words, the relentless repetition of ""never"" served as a lifeline, propelling the protagonist through the harshest of environments. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry against the oppressive silence of Endless Sands, a declaration that reverberated across the vast expanse.

Through the lens of epizeuxis, I delved into the depths of the character's determination. The harsh environment became a character in itself, challenging the protagonist to defy the odds with unwavering persistence. The echoes of ""never"" transformed into a symbol of resilience, a beacon of hope that cut through the desolation of Endless Sands.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

Amidst the starlit expanse of Cosmos Haven, where galaxies danced in celestial choreography, a cryptic prophecy emerged—a message written in the stars. As the narrative unfolded, I embarked on a cosmic journey guided by the acrostic hidden within the constellations.

For a cascade of words, the initial letters of key phrases illuminated the path of destiny for the characters. Each sentence unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden message that transcended the boundaries of time and space. The acrostic became a celestial guide, leading the protagonists through the intricate tapestry of their interconnected fates.

Through the lens of acrostic, I explored the cosmic forces that shaped the destinies of Cosmos Haven's inhabitants. The celestial bodies became storytellers, each constellation contributing a verse to the epic narrative written across the cosmos. As the characters deciphered the acrostic, they unraveled the mysteries of their existence, connecting the dots between the stars and their own profound journeys.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1761899433.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

She always indulged him when he wanted her to hear something he’d worked on. It was becoming a way for them to reconnect – checking into their respective lives and his rough cuts. He didn’t have something to show her every time. Sometimes she was the one asking him, each new piece a glimpse into his mind. Adam would then untangle the cables in his backpack and hand her his headphones. Heavy, high fidelity, and too big for her face, she had to hold them up with both hands. He’d plug the aux cord into his splitter and they’d both listen along to his work. 

As she listened, he watched her reactions closely, curiosity in his brown eyes. They’d smile at each other over the music. Those were the moments she felt closest to him, like she could almost start to know him. She could tell her opinion had become important to him somewhere along the way, and it thrilled her. Despite her lack of knowledge, she knew she had a good ear and wanted to impress him. But tonight, he was nervous, fiddling with his black hair then pushing it back from his face over and over.

They sat cross-legged on the floor, his laptop on the coffee table. The hotel suite was too large and cold, but huddling up to him felt good. His brow furrowed, he eyed her as if deciding something then pulled up a Pro Tools session soberly titled with today’s date, 2025-10-23. She pressed the headphones in tighter as slow minor chords rose up from a piano. Adam was watching her so intensely, one earbud in, it made her self-conscious. She looked down at her lap, focusing on his voice. Raspy but controlled, he sang about not knowing his place, his standing. The delicate piano melody was so sweet a wash of emotion rose in her throat. The song was all soft longing, tenderness and fear. *I want to be with you. I want to be with you,* the chorus repeated, and a second unfinished verse faded out to silence. Putting the headphones down, she couldn't bring herself to look up even though she could feel his eyes on her. She had to say something. The song was obviously about them, about her, and really, he was asking her a question. 

Their bar-fueled hook-up in Tokyo had turned into an *I would like to see you again* DM from him, a reunion in his hotel room in Osaka, cheeky texts peppering the following weeks before they saw each other again in Fukuoka, then Busan, then Seoul. He was touring, she was backpacking Asia. And she didn’t mind catching a flight here and there to meet him in fancy hotels. It was hot and fun and she really was trying not to get ahead of herself. This just wasn’t real life. 

She slowly looked up from her lap, stopping short at his mouth. Leaning in, he met her, softly.  The question still on his lips and her wariness on hers.

\-----------------------------

Her shoulder blades slide down her back in relief as the elevator doors closed. She’d pined for him for days, but less than 12 hours later she was just glad to be on her own again. She knew herself well enough to know she needed alone processing time - a.k.a walk fast in one direction with a playlist at max volume. 

Striding across the cavernous, never-ending lobby, she could feel the staff’s eyes on her. Did they know where she had just spent the night? Were they judging her for being that kind of girl? Was she too self-involved and these people did not give a damn? She felt like they cared. Maybe because *she* cared. Pushing through the revolving doors, she was swallowed into the  street noise and sticky humidity. Whatever, screw the lobby staff of the Park Hyatt Hong Kong. She had some compulsive walking to get to.

Her feet beat the pavement as she replayed fragments of last night. Twisting her memories this way and that to catch any mis-interpretation. What did Adam really mean with that song? You can’t take lyrics too literally. Maybe he just needed things to rhyme.  Maybe this was a game for him. Semi-famous musician toys with gullible thirty year old, gets off on her eagerness. 

All at once the morning light felt too bright in her eyes, and she felt exposed, ashamed. Deepening her breaths, she slowed her walking. If he really did want some kind of relationship with her, then surely there was something wrong with him. A well adjusted, emotionally mature adult would see that this was a huge reach. They barely knew each other, existed in fully separate worlds, let alone culture and languages. Chemistry and attraction can only take you so far. Even entertaining the thought of there being something more felt too dangerous, vertiginous. 

Drawing up to a red light at a pedestrian crossing, she felt her shirt sticking to her back. He had sensed her hesitation last night and there’d been a wounded look in his eyes. She’d offered some half-assed excuse about not being able to think about these things right now, and as she retreated into herself, she’d seen him clocking it, too. She had met his naked vulnerability with a pathetic faltering. She cringed. The rest of the night had passed under a cloud of disappointment. They’d gone to bed early, barely touching and she was pretty sure he was also relieved to see her off this morning. The light turned green and she started aggressively across the street. ",1,1761899418.0,RomanceWriters,0,1.0,False

Hi! I'm trying this again 😅 As long as this post is still up (even if it is days/weeks/months), it means I'm still looking! 

**The relationship I'm looking for:**
* a monogamous, romantic, long term FLR relationship with the goal of marriage
* For me, FLR is a lifestyle where you respect my authority, preferences, and consent while my domme side is reserved for bedroom/private only.
* online to in real life. Not really open to travel/relocate to the other side of the world as of the moment and am only willing to travel within Asia or near Asia so please consider this before reaching out. 

**Get to know me:**
* 29 F, 152cm, single, chubby | plus-size, Asian, pale/light skinned, brown small eyes, and currently have black hair
* living in Asia (GMT +8) 
* I have little scars all over my body (from pets, work, & clumsiness. Not due to bdsm. Minor only but noticeable up close.)
* domme leaning switch: gentle domme or princess sub (sharing this to help gauge compatibility)
* strong personality, introvert, straightforward, clingy, committed, demisexual, and emotionally honest
* love languages:  physical touch, quality time, and acts of service hence I prefer someone I can meet regularly / often 
* focused on my career
* some interests I have: caring for dogs & cats, gaming (switch), F1, coffee, exercising, flowers 

**The person I'm looking for:**
* 23 to 35 
* must be single male & is looking for friendship to date to marry (Please don’t message if you’re married, poly/ENM, or taken.)
* from anywhere as long as you can commit to daily messaging and possibly future meet ups. Not expecting instant replies but longer gaps (>2hrs) makes it hard to connect. Based on experience, I find it hard to maintain constant communication with larger timezone difference.
* service top sub or switch (pleasure dom) 
* someone who loves/ open to plus-size body types 
* hygienic, patient, emotionally available, & emotionally intelligent 
* must like and can live with dogs & cats (dealbreaker)
* non-smoker & ddf (dealbreaker)

**NSFW** (not really into hard kinks and are into gentle kinks)
* not into open/poly, findom, sissification, illegal, blood, scating, drugs, smokers, ageplay roleplay, degrading, humiliation, Ddlg, cuckolding 

**If you will message me,**
* don't jump into sexting or sending me nsfw pics, please.
* don't jump into a dynamic meaning don't call me mistress, mommy, etc immediately 
* have the intention of wanting to be friends with me/ get to know me first before moving on to a relationship
* committed to this connection. Know that I will only be talking to you once we have established exclusivity and I hope you are the same.
* be consistent. I value daily conversations & emotional presence 

**Read everything & still would like to message me? Kindly include in your initial message:**
* age, sex, location, physical description (hair, body, eyes, height, etc, whatever you want. Just wanna picture you in my head)
* what hobbies do you have
* where are you currently in life?
* fave emoji 

To help you decide if we match, here are some questions:

Are you....
* ..... a lover of plus size body types?
* ..... looking for a long term romantic partner?
* ..... open to a FLR relationship?
* ..... open to possible in person meet ups?
* ..... can live with dogs & cats in the future?
* ..... an initiator?
* ..... seeking a meaningful connection more than a sexual connection?

If you answer ""yes"" to all the questions above, then maybe you should send me a message. 

I do appreciate a more meaningful message rather than just a one liner. **Also, no lying. I hate liars** :) 

No hard feelings: I will only reply (with more questions) to the user that I feel will match with me.
