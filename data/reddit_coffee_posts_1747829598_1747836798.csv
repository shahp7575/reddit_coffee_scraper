Today(like other days) isn't easy at all and i'm not strong mentally as i try to sound because my mom's and my grandparents death is still haunting me daily but you know some days i'm not thinking at it and others days like today is like my only focus so i struggle to be efficient and producitve as i want. So this morning i did the meeting i had to do and did a few other things and took the evening off just to try to clear my mind. Kat was with me after her treatment and we spent a few hours together just going around the city, we took coffee, talked and she tried to ""cheer me up"".

So the main point of all of this is that we were talking there out of her house when i recieved a short video from the people of the campus in my name. It wad just a short video of less then 30 seconds where there were some kids (68) waving with their little hands in front of the campus entrance with my name on it just saying ""thank you"". So nothing of so much special or new but that short video made me extremely emotional and i admit that a few tears went down. And the thing is that when Kat saw me like this and i showed her the video she immediatly looked up at me and told me to pick her up for a hug and then said ""maybe you're not that cold, look at you. You are crying"" and started to kiss me.

I know that this is a small thing but it's like just this short video made me smile again and say ""see, you're not some cold robot. You're a human and with your money and efforts you're really helping someone"".

So nothing just this, just a short video that i keep replying made me think that maybe, just maybe i' not that cold robot that everyone say. Maybe i'm capable of showing emotions even if not like everyone else and not often like everyone else.",1,1747836640.0,u_Traditional-Area-648,0,1.0,False

Ive noticed this weird reaction my body has whenever I finish an iced coffee or an iced tea. Somehow, whenever I finish the last sip of either drink, my body instinctively sneezes. Sometimes it’s only once, other times it’s multiple times, accompanied by a runny nose for a while. Sweet tea from McDonalds seems to trigger it the most however it will almost always happen once without fail. 

Other drinks like soda, sparkling water, energy drinks have rarely, if ever has caused me to sneeze as a reaction to finishing them. 

I’m curious if there’s a reason to why this could be happening. Im not worried about it being unhealthy as it seems to be harmless. Has anyone else experienced this?

Ask yourself one question after another.

Keep asking questions, without answering any of them.

Ask the first question that pops into your mind after each one.

You can write them down or just think about them.

Jump around and ask random questions. 

Focused questions that relate to one another is good too. 

Go as long as you want, it's a meditation exercise. Maybe set a timer.

Here is an example of my own:


Questions 
How can I not feel so depressed and insecure about myself? What can I do besides distracting myself with TV and tiktok? Can I do something besides using drugs? What will happen if I put my mind to things that matter and focus? What can I do to give myself more patience for myself? How can I not be distracted by other people and their feelings? How can I give myself a feeling of purpose and fulfillment by myself? Can I make friends and still have emotional feelings for myself and not hang on to others? What will happen if I take focus away from other people and focus on how I'm feeling? Will taking time away from old feelings result in an anger and tantrum inducing event? Am I capable of doing all these things? What can I do in the future that will ease the anger ahead of time so I don't get wrapped up and spiral? Am I spiraling right now? How easy is it for me to spiral out of control? Can I block old memories from popping up that cause me to spiral? Should I drink coffee? Does my defensive mechanisms of getting lost in my mind, turn into an ocd event where I'm always lost and confused and have a low attention span for what I'm feeling in the moment, cause me to lose myself instead into a purgatory of trauma and a life of detriment? Am I confusing real feelings for fake/chaotic ones? Is feeling justified and right a compensation for feeling insecure and shame and feeling ""wrong""? Do I look at past events and compare them to these feelings, to project? Can I feel a sense of overjoyed independence? Can I still do things even though I have a gigantic hospital bill? Can I feel justified in getting help or looking at the whole situation with logic and reason instead of punishing myself for trying something new? Can I start over and look at myself in a new way, without self harm and reverting back to old ways of thinking?

1kryn4h,https://i.redd.it/a90j95ii652f1.jpeg,“Feline Damnation” - Alternate Gabriel VS Neco-Arc (The Mandela Catalogue VS Nasuverse),"
*Date unknown, St. Gabriel Church, Mandela County*

In the dimly lit expanse of an abandoned cathedral, the air grows heavy with an unnatural stillness. Gabriel materializes, his distorted form casting elongated shadows that dance across the crumbling walls. His stretched eyes scan the surroundings, sensing an anomaly in the fabric of reality. ~~an anomaly that he will not allow to threaten his plan~~

Gabriel: ""Do not be afraid, come out of hiding… nothing is worth the risk for I am your true savior.""

A sudden burst of confetti and a blaring kazoo disrupt the silence as Neco-Arc descends from the rafters, landing with a theatrical pose. ~~This, this pest need to be dealt with for she is interfering with the Devil’s plan.~~

Neco-Arc: ""Buru-nyuuu~! Did someone order chaos with a side of absurdity?""

Gabriel: “Now, whatever could give you the thought you could hurt me?

Neco-Arc: “Hmmmm, last guy who said that got death beamed.”

Gabriel: “Well then, heheheh, Let’s hope you don’t die to quickly…I want to enjoy every second of your suffering”

Gabriel's expression remains unchanged, but the atmosphere grows colder. He extends a hand, and the surrounding shadows coalesce into writhing tendrils, lashing out towards Neco-Arc, ~~lashing out at his nuisance.~~

Neco-Arc: ""Ooh, spooky tentacles! But can they handle... the power of interpretive dance?""

She begins a nonsensical dance, her movements so erratic that the tendrils hesitate, seemingly confused. Taking advantage of the moment, Neco-Arc unleashes her ""True Ancestor Beam,"" a chaotic blast of energy that distorts the very space it traverses. Gabriel is struck, his form flickering as he momentarily loses cohesion. ~~his perfect form struck by this weak mind, this pathetic excuse of a mortal had injured him.~~

Gabriel: “Fascinating craftsmanship, consider me nearly impressed hehehe, still foolish, however, for you to believe you stand a chance against me. Your antics are meaningless. I am the harbinger of humanity's end.""

Regaining his composure, Gabriel summons a legion of Alternates, their forms shifting and contorting as they surround Neco-Arc. The cathedral becomes a maze of mirrors, ~~each readying to end this pathetic nuisance once and for all~~

Gabriel: “I will know what you love, I will know what you dread, I will know what makes you whole!”

Neco-Arc: ""Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the craziest of them all?""

She pulls out a giant mallet labeled ""Plot Device"" and smashes the nearest mirror, causing a chain reaction that shatters the illusions. The Alternates recoil, their connection to Gabriel momentarily disrupted. ~~His patience running out as this nuisance is proving more difficult than he thought~~

Gabriel: “Your annoyance has brought my patience to its last straw. I am this world's savior, you are but a pathetic weak mind masquerading as a comedian. You never stood a chance as this fight was over from the start and your fear will bring me joy as your last moments of suffering play out! Your existence has meant nothing! FOR I AM THE DEVIL ! THE FACADE! THE DECEIVER! AND THIS! ENDS! NOW.”

He emits a pulse of energy, inducing a wave of shadow that distorts the environment, turning the cathedral into a nightmarish landscape. He then unleashes a wave of MAD into Neco-Arc's mind. ~~This weak minded comedian was going to die by his hand for he had one more trick up his sleeves~~. But Neco-Arc persists, her 4th wall awareness allows her to resist MAD.

Neco-Arc: ""Whoa, trippy! But two can play at this game.""

She activates her ""Opuba!"" warp skill, teleporting erratically and leaving behind afterimages that taunt and mock Gabriel. The confusion allows her to launch a surprise attack, transforming into a rocket and colliding with Gabriel in an explosion of glitter and nonsensical sound effects. ~~The Devil’s blood once again spilled by this comedian, this insect, who had made a mockery of his divine nature, his patience and temper has been broken~~. 

Gabriel: ""I WILL KNOW WHAT YOU FEAR!!!”.

Drawing upon the full extent of his power, Gabriel's then teleport Neco-Arc into the endless desert, attempting to trap ~~this pathetic creature~~, he then appears in front of Neco-Arc, his hands outstretched, as he gave a speech to this ~~nuisance~~.

Gabriel: “You were sooo close… The stage was set for you, and yet you still follow the shepherd. You are a fool! Our game has been fun, but alas I have long since grown tired, and end this now.…something I should’ve done since the start”.

But then Neco-Arc interrupts Gabriel with a move that blindsighted him.

Neco-Arc: ""Time for my ultimate move: I want to go to the Crocodile Garden!""

She summons the Elite Neco Corps, an infinite swarm of identical cat-like beings that overwhelm Gabriel and the endless desert, their combined randomness disrupting the infinite sands. The Elite Neco Corps all grouped in on a massive tackle on Gabriel, they clawed and slashed at him, bit down anything to finally kill Gabriel.

Gabriel has had his patience broken, his blood spilled, his perfect divinity destroyed, ~~his godlike position insulted by a pathetic weak creature that masquerade as a comedian, one he himself would not waste his breath on, THIS NUISANCE WILL DIE BY HIS HAND FOR HE WAS THE DEVIL AND HE WILL KILL THIS INSECT~~

~~ONCE AND FOR ALL!!!~~

With a burst of darkness, all the Elite Neco Corps went flying off him, he was bloodied, but most importantly he was MAD. Gabriel in his raged state looked on to see Neco-Arc, now freed from the infinite sand as she looked back with a mischievous expression as she used the power of The Second Magic and suddenly opened a portal to Ahnenerbe, an interdimensional coffee shop where parallel worlds converges. ~~This cowardly nuisance was attempting to run away from him~~.

Gabriel: “RUNNING AWAY ARE YOU!? IT WON’T MATTER IN THE SLIGHTEST!!!”.

But Neco-Arc responded with her final word to Gabriel.

Neco-Arc: “Buru-nyuuu~”

And then she dash through the portal and closes it, leaving Gabriel behind in the endless desert but before he knows it, he suddenly spots a giant Food Can approaching him from the endless sky of the endless desert. This was Neco-Arc's final move, the Food Can crashing into the endless desert and unleashing a massive wave of energy comparable to an infinite amount of Big Bangs as the endless desert is being vaporized at a rapid rate. Gabriel attempted to teleport out, to escape this madness, ~~he is the Devil, he was GOD, he was the SERPENT, he will NOT SUCCUMB TO THIS!!!~~ but it does not matter in the end as he was caught up in the explosion, its interdimensional blinding energy vaporizing his very soul as his essence is being now scattered into the nothingness that used to be the endless desert.

Gabriel: “No! NO! NOOOO! THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE! I WAS THIS WORLD’S TRUE SAVIOR! HOW CAN THIS BE! BESTED BY THIS! THIS ~~PATHETIC INSECT!!!~~”.

And then with his last words, Gabriel's essence scatters into the void.

*K.O!*

Meanwhile in the physical world, all of the Alternates remaining had completely dissolved with the death of their former master. While in the shop located in the void between dimensions (Ahnenerbe), Neco-Arc is seen attending her shop, now aware of Gabriel’s death due to her 4th Wall awareness and she had only one thing to say.

Neco-Arc: ""SUCCESS!”.

*The End*

At Releaf, we recognise just how much courage it takes to break free from social and societal norms and begin to advocate for your own healing. 

After the tragic passing of her mother, Hannah found herself trapped in a terrible cycle of anxiety which led her to retreat from the outside world for six long months. When Hannah did reach out for help, she was prescribed a series of pharmaceuticals that came with a long list of side effects - and nothing she tried felt quite right to her.  

A conversation with a friend who had been prescribed medical cannabis for epilepsy sparked Hannah’s curiosity and, after a quick google search, Releaf popped up as the number one result. Just a week later, she scheduled her first consultation with our doctors, marking the start of her new healing journey.

Hannah’s story is not just about coping with anxiety; it’s about finding the courage to trust yourself enough to rise above societal stigmas; it’s about listening to your heart.

# Can you tell us about your health history, and what treatments you’ve tried in the past?

I’ve struggled with serious anxiety for a number of years, ever since my mum passed away. That is what triggered it.

For the first six months after that, I literally didn't leave my house and, eventually, I had to go to a mental health hospital to get help. At the hospital, I was put on several different types of medications, including diazepam. That helped for a while. It was nice to know that at least I had an option for when I was losing control, and I would always keep the diazepam in my back pocket, just in case a panic attack happened. 

But, I didn't like using it and didn’t use it often, because I didn't like the way it made me feel—I just generally don't like taking pharmaceutical medications. Eventually, my doctor took me off the diazepam, because it is linked to so many other illnesses, and that left me in a strange headspace. It was like, “*What am I going to do now?”*

I said to myself, *“Am I just going to go back to where I won't go out at all? I won't go places? I won't push myself to do things because I'm scared?”*

That's when my friend told me about the medical cannabis he’d been prescribed for his epilepsy. After that conversation, I thought, “*Okay, I need to start looking into this and see if this is something that could be a good alternative for me.”*

# What kind of research did you do before you discovered Releaf, and what was the sign-up process like?

I started off online. **I googled the different medical cannabis clinics in the UK, and Releaf came up as the number one search result, so that’s what led me there in the first place. I looked at the website and read the testimonials from all the different people who had tried Releaf, and their stories were really helpful in deciding that this was the right clinic for me.** 

**The sign-up process was really quick and easy. I thought it would take several weeks, but it was much faster than that.** There was a small problem at first: I requested my medical records from the NHS, but the records didn’t show all the different medications I’d been prescribed. I called the support team at Releaf, and they were able to tell me exactly what I needed to do to resolve the situation. After that, everything happened very fast. It was just so simple. **Within a week, I was able to book my first consultation.** 

The consultation felt just like a normal doctor's appointment at first, except this doctor was incredibly thorough, going through all my history with me step by step. He was very caring, and listened to me carefully when I explained about what I'd been going through. The doctor explained all the different strains, the difference between cannabis flower and cannabis oil, and all the different treatment options.

# Since joining Releaf, have you found a treatment that works well for you?

Yes. **I work full-time, and I'm a mother of a six-year-old, so I need a treatment that works for my condition but also allows me to get on with my day. I think my doctor and I have found a good balance, and my treatment with medical cannabis doesn’t get in the way of my job or being a mum.** 

For me, the treatment is sort of a routine, like a daily ritual: I get up in the morning before my son's up and getting ready for school. I get my coffee, use my vape pen, and then I get breakfast going. It’s just a normal part of my day—my new normal.

So far, I prefer the cannabis flower rather than the oil. There are some flower strains that work very well in both the day and then evening, so that’s what I’ve been using. 

One interesting thing I’ve noticed is that sometimes after using the same strain for a while, I like to change to a different one. My doctor at Releaf is quite flexible that way, which is fantastic. If I call him up and say, *“I really liked the strain I was using before, would it be okay if I go back to that one?”* there’s no problem; no pressure. He always says, *“Keep in contact with us, let us know if things aren’t quite right, and we can adjust things until they are.”* 

**And, I’ve had no negative reactions to any of the different strains or treatments I’ve tried. Zero. None.**

# What changes in your health have you noticed since starting medical cannabis?

It's definitely been a big improvement since I started with Releaf, because I've been able to do so much more and not worry about things. I’ve been able to go out and just get on with things that I normally would have struggled with. 

Usually, with my anxiety, if I had to go somewhere outside the city that I live in, I would start to panic. Now, I'm able to do that without being stressed. 

Recently, I was even able to go for a little holiday out of town recently in Enniskillen, here in Northern Ireland, which I would never have done before I discovered medical cannabis. I was with my dad, my brother, my partner, and my kids, and it was amazing to be there and not be panicking all the time. The adults all knew I was taking medical cannabis, and they commented about how they had noticed a big positive change.  

**I’d love to try and go abroad next year, which would be like a major step for me. I haven't been abroad since the anxiety started, so I'd love to be able to take my six-year-old on a summer holiday—that would be brilliant.** 

I’ve also cut down on the other medication that I take for my anxiety, which is excellent. After my doctor took me off the diazepam, they increased my dose of another antianxiety medication called Vensir, and the side effects were horrible. I got quite tense, it felt almost like I had drunk a million cups of coffee at once—just buzzing and with a clenched jaw. The medical cannabis helped with that—it sort of took away that tenseness, and I’ve significantly cut down the Vensir dosage now. 

# And, have you spoken to your NHS doctor about using medical cannabis since you started your treatment at Releaf? 

**I did mention to my GP and other doctors that I had started using medical cannabis. It's a bit sad, because my doctors didn't seem to have much knowledge about it. They just said,** ***“We can't advise you about that. We're not trained.”*** 

**I thought,** ***“Well, that's okay, because I've got Releaf and they are trained, so it's fine.”***

# Finally, what would you say to somebody with a similar condition,who may be considering medical cannabis as a treatment?

I would say to definitely go for it. If you're at the end of your tether like I was, you won't have much to lose. People who are suffering need to just forget about the stigma and what other people think. **Of course, there are many medications people abuse, but they're still beneficial to the people who use them appropriately. Medical cannabis is no different**. I think people need to just take that first step, not worry about the stigma, and just do what's best for them. 

**Releaf is helping people, and that’s the main thing to remember. These patient stories are a big step toward getting rid of the negative stigma about medical cannabis, which is really the only negative thing that hangs over my treatment.** 

**It’s definitely about education: the more we learn, the more the stigma will fade away.**

My sleep is messed up so if you're wanting soneone to chat all night and day with that's me.

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome. I've been playing the new Doom game. Will also be down playing games if we hit it off.

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.

Hmm how I would describe myself? Black hair. Beard. Brown eyes. Dad bod. Hairy. I've been told I had nice eye lashes.

Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I mainly listen to rock and metal. But I do on occasion listen to the Macarena and Barbie girl as I shower or cook. Zeppelin, the doors and a myriad of other classic bands are always playing.

I like coffee too. Preferably caramel. Also a redbull fan. I can drink many of those. Probably shouldn't since I don't think that's medically sound.

Pretty much looking for some fun and maybe make a friend in the process. I like to think I'm a decent conversationalist but who knows. Not sure if this is enticing so far.     ",1,1747836079.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

[**Risvelium**](https://parfumexquis.com/products/risvelium?variant=46642114068736) (Italian for “awakening”) by **Orto Parisi** is not your everyday scent. This is a **raw, untamed, primal composition**, the kind of fragrance you wear when you're done trying to please people and ready to connect with your animal side.

Like most of Alessandro Gualtieri’s work under Orto Parisi, Risvelio isn’t about following structure—it’s about **evoking a feeling**, an instinct, an atmosphere. And what you get here is a visceral jolt to the senses.

From the very beginning, Risvelio announces itself with something **green and feral**—think **crushed herbs, pungent roots, sharp citrus**, and maybe even a spark of coffee bitterness. It’s like stumbling barefoot through wild terrain at dawn, with damp moss under your feet and the air full of tension.

As it settles, a **complex herbal accord** unfolds—smoky, slightly burnt, but not in the cozy fireplace way. More like the scorched bark of a tree struck by lightning. There’s also a signature **Orto Parisi funk** here—just a whisper of **body warmth, earth, and skin**, grounding the composition and making it feel personal, intimate, even carnal.

📝 **Vibe Check:**

*   Herbaceous and slightly metallic opening
    
*   Earthy, animalic core—like nature reclaiming its space
    
*   Woody, leathery drydown that wears close and lingers for hours
    
*   Smells more like **a memory or a mood** than a traditional perfume
    

Risvelio is not for blind buying. It’s a **statement**, not a crowd-pleaser. It’s for those who appreciate **brutal beauty**, who want a scent that sparks reaction and emotion. It has this savage grace to it—**part hunter, part forest spirit**, part sleepless wanderer.

✨ Who should wear this?

*   Lovers of **Nasomatto**, **BeauFort**, or **Zoologist**\-style experimentation
    
*   Anyone bored of mass-appeal freshness and craving **edge and truth**
    
*   Ideal for fall, mysterious nights, or personal rituals
    

Longevity is outstanding, as expected from the house. It doesn’t just last—it **settles into your skin** and evolves, like nature itself.

1kryji9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kryji9/the_word_he_wrote/,The Word He Wrote,"I'm a volunteer psychologist in a war zone. But I’m not writing this as a therapist right now. I’m writing this as someone who, for the first time in a long time, is truly afraid.

The shelter where I’m working sits atop a hill of red earth, an old structure that seems to bleed when it rains. They say the house was once owned by a wealthy landowning family. Then, a field hospital. Now, it’s run by a European NGO that takes in children displaced by civil war in small Eastern European regions.

I’ve been here for just over two months. There are three shared dorms, a makeshift consultation room (where I also sleep), a basic kitchen, and a large basement where we store supplies and some files no one seems to want to touch. The house groans at night, like wood in pain, just like its “guests.”

During the day, things are almost normal. The children draw, play what they can still call play, and sometimes they even forget about the war for a few minutes. It’s absolutely heartbreaking to see such young children not spared from witnessing things that would shatter most adults. I couldn’t just sit and watch this happen. It felt noble, important even life-saving. That is, until the boy arrived.

He came this past Monday, brought in by soldiers from the Northern Army. No documents. A wet backpack. Caked in dry earth. Eyes too knowing. Silent. The nurse tried to speak to him. So did I. Nothing. He just grabbed a piece of paper with his small, dirty fingers and wrote a single word:

**""below""**

No punctuation. No emotion. No capitals. He just pushed the paper toward me and kept staring over my shoulder, like something was behind me.

And that’s what he’s done ever since: he walks silently through the house, draws with obsessive intensity, and writes that same word: **below**. The volunteers started calling him “The Pit Boy.”

  
But he listens. I see it. He listens *very* well, and that’s why I avoid any jokes or nicknames.

My routine with him started simple. Passive observation at first. Then short sessions in the office, even if he didn’t speak. Slowly, we gathered more information: he was the only survivor of what they’re calling a *“rural cleansing.”* His village was wiped off the map, the bodies left to rot in the streets. He was found inside a dry well.

I had to fight back tears every time I looked into his eyes...

The first time he drew in front of me was during our fourth session. He sat still for twenty minutes, then pulled out his notebook and drew the outline of a large, deep hole in shaky, spiraling lines. At the center: a dark spiral.

Around the hole: hands. Lots of hands. Some looked like children’s. Others... far too large.

He looked at me, and once again, tears welled up. What had this poor soul seen in that pit? Were the enemies tormenting him? Had he listened to everyone he loved being killed while he hid underground?

Then, he wrote the same word in the corner of the paper:  
**below**

I forced a smile. I told him he could draw other things. I told him he was safe here.  
He just pushed the paper toward me again, harder this time.

The worst part happened last night.

There were light footsteps in the hallway downstairs, even though everyone was asleep.  
I woke up with Ramires, one of the NGO workers (our “bodyguard”) covering my mouth. My heart nearly exploded until I realized it was him. He motioned *shhh*, and I nodded.

“What’s wrong?” I whispered.

“There’s an intruder downstairs… armed.”

A chill shot up my spine. All I could think about was the children. What this man might do.  
If he was alone. If maybe death wasn’t even the worst he could bring us.

Ramires interrupted my spiral of thoughts by handing me a gun. He had another in his own hand.

“I’m going down. If you get a clear shot, even if I’m in the way **don’t hesitate**.”

I couldn’t answer. He just cracked open the office door and stepped out. I followed.  
We crept down the stairs carefully, sweeping the space for movement. Nothing.  
Just dead silence.

Until, passing the kitchen entrance, something leapt from inside. A shadow. It fell onto me.

I felt the barrel of a rifle press into my neck. All I could see was the glint of a helmet as a thick-accented voice shouted:

**“Where is he? Where’s that (word I couldn’t understand)?”**

I know it only lasted a few seconds (but for me, and for my neck, it felt like forever) until Ramires fired. The man dropped. Lifeless. Blood spreading fast across the floor.

We could already hear footsteps upstairs. The kids were waking up and the nurse scrambled to get them back into their rooms before they saw the mess.

“Shit,” I said, rubbing my throat. “Any more of them?”

“No,” my colleague replied. “Just this one. Seems like he was after the…”

His voice trailed off.  
I turned to see what had stopped him.

There he was, standing on the stairs.  
The boy from the pit.

We both froze, unsure how to react.

“Hey buddy,” Ramires said gently. “It’s late. Go back to your room, okay?”

The boy’s eyes were wide. Glassy.  
While they tried to soothe him, I noticed something: the wounded soldier was still moving, barely. His eyes darted around wildly. Not at us:  
At *the boy*.

I saw his hand reaching for his weapon, and I swear it wasn’t a choice, it was faster than thought.

I shot him.

Again. And again. Until the bullets ran dry. Until he *stopped moving,* while the boy watched in silence. As soon as I came to my senses, I dropped the weapon, stunned. I mumbled a faint “good night” and ran back to my office, where I collapsed into sobs.

This morning, one of the caretakers said she found the boy outside in the garden.  
On his knees. Digging with his bare hands.The ground was dry. Hard. His fingers bled from the nails, but he kept digging like it was urgent.

When I approached, he stopped.  
His knees were scraped, his body covered in soil. Then he started writing again,  
but this time, *on his own arm*, with a bloody finger:

**below**

My stomach turned. That’s why I had to write this somewhere. To not lose my grip. Because ever since then I’ve started hearing *sounds.* The shelter is silent, but I can’t focus, and it’s not the coffee. It’s that feeling. Like something *underneath us* is… moving.

I got up. I slowly made my way down the wooden stairs. The pale sun slipped through the windows, carried by a freezing breeze. As I passed the basement, I swear I heard something. A tiny voice, whispering one word.I know what it said, because it repeated it. Twice. It said:

**“Mommy…?”**

I froze. It couldn’t be. I *know* that voice. And God help me, it’s tearing me apart. It was *wet.*Like it came from underwater, through a diving mask.

I didn’t go in. Not today. I won’t.

I closed the door quietly and went back to my room. And there, on the floor, I found a new drawing. I don’t know how it got in, the door was locked. But the paper was there. It was the same hole, bbut this time someone was *kneeling* at the edge.

No face.  
Just long brown hair.  
Like mine.

And below her: Hands. So many hands, reaching up. And in the corner of the paper—something new. Not the word *“below.”* But a full sentence. In childish handwriting:

**“She’s going down too.”**

I’m a psychologist. Scientific. Rational. But now, I’ve locked my door from the inside  
And dragged the cabinet in front of it. Because I hear footsteps in the ceiling. And through the peephole, I can see the boy.

Sitting in the hallway, staring at me.

Not blinking.  
Not moving.

His hands covered in dirt.

Hey, I’m Mia! I’m “Gold Verified” in this sub and here for something real.

Im looking to find a genuine girlfriend experience, focused on authentic connection..not just a surface level, transactional thing. I’m not here to play a role or put on a show. I’m 100% myself at all times, what you see is what you get with me! I value real chemistry and conversations that actually mean something. For me, this isn’t about just going through the motions. Im looking for some laugh with! Like, really laugh. The kind of laugh that makes your stomach hurt and has you spitting out your coffee 😆. That kind of connection is what I’m about … frequent, effortless, and full of joy ♥️ 

Let’s be honestt, “spicy” content is everywhere, and most of it’s free to look at. What I’m looking for is something you can’t just scroll and find .. real companionship anddd intimacy. That’s the real luxury. I’m looking for someone who gets that, who’s more interested in connection.

Outside of reddit, I live a full, vibrant life. I’m career driven, but in my free time you’ll find me enjoying Italian dinners with family, hiking with my dogs, soaking up the summer sun at the beach, binge watching a good series or crime show, or curled up in oversized sweats reading a book or working on my novel. I thrive on good vibes, spontaneous plans, and heart to hearts.

Whether you’re extroverted like me or more on the quiet side, I click best with people who are genuine and emotionally available. Sometimes opposites really do attract and balance each other perfectly, though!  At the end of the day, I’m grounded, low-drama, and bring something unique to the table. I pride myself on being real…no games, no pretense, just me.

If you’ve read this far, chances are you’re exactly the kind of person I’d love to connect with. Curious? You should be. 😏 Send me a message and let’s see where this goes.

1kryidr,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1kryidr/acquired_tastes_in_the_pursuit_of_migraine_relief/,Acquired tastes in the pursuit of migraine relief?,"Anybody else resorted to trying ""treatments"" you really don't like to get migraine relief... only to use them long enough they kind of grow on you? Or how about things you just can't make yourself try for the same reason?

Here's my list:

For starters, I'm not a fan of infused water. Of any kind. I don't actively dislike it for the most part, I just don't really _taste_ it... it's just a vague ""not quite water"" to me, and if I were going for flavor I'd rather just drink plain water.

But when I found out chamomile and lavender tea can help with migraines, I started drinking it enough that the only thing stopping me from doing it regularly is the need to brew it.

From there I moved onto caffeinated options throughout the day: sweetened black tea, white tea with suggestions of fruit, and Cirkul's caffeinated waters, all based on the assumption they should at least be healthier than drinking a Coke all day. (I have Mio bottles for the same reason, but prefer Cirkul's method of controling the amount of flavor). I have flavoring options to add to unsweetened tea as well, but might just say ""fuck it"" re the preservatives and keep drinking Pure Leaf and Gold Peak.

That being said, while I've found myself reaching for the Cirkul instead of plain water at work, none of these are ""pleasure"" drinks... if I'm going to guzzle down a lot of tea when a migraine _isn't_ looming, it's to finish off a batch before it's old enough to go down the drain.

I cannot convince myself to drink coffee for the purpose. I've never liked it, and it's on a whole different level than not being ""a fan"" of tea.

Electrolytes though? Never had a problem with Fiji water though no idea how much I'm really getting. (I normally drink Core for the added magnesium but got a case of Fiji at Sam's Club for cheaper than what I've been paying for the Core.) And it's been a long time since I've had coconut water, though I bought a few flavored varieties on sale to see what I might like. But when going out of my way to look for an electrolyte-laden drink (that isn't gatorade) I figured I'd be better off starting with some kind of ""juice"" that I'm likely to like of its own accord, so I picked Bolthouse Farms ""Hydration"" Waternelon Dragon Fruit and... I can taste the salt strongly enough that I've only ever managed to sip at it. It can go either way at this point between acquiring the taste or actively disliking it, but I'm pretty sure I _won't_ be one of the ones drinking actual salt water for the purpose.

More experimenting is needed: green tea, those flavoring options I mentioned (think orange syrup like you might use in coffee and similar options), the coconut water, this Stash brand apple chamomile latte.... That's all for decluttering my pantry though. While I've described myself as a magpie when it comes to desiring ""shiny"" new flavors I _think_ I've (mostly) convinced myself I don't need to keep buying varieties to try. Maybe.

Spoiler alert: It’s not all just luck and cat videos!

So, picture this: You spend hours crafting what you think is the **ultimate post**, only for it to get about three likes (and we’re being generous here). Sound familiar? You’re not alone! We've all been there. But guess what? There’s a method to the madness, and you can learn to tap into it.

Here are some **keys to creating viral content** that’ll have your audience craving more:

### 1. **Know Your Audience**
- Who are you talking to? 
- Are they scrolling during their coffee break, or are they late-night doom-scrolling?
- Tailor your content to fit their vibe. If they love humor, give them a giggle. If they’re looking for inspiration, hit them with something uplifting!

### 2. **Emotional Triggers Matter**
- Joy, surprise, anger... you name it!
- Content that stirs emotions tends to be shared more. Think of the last meme that made you laugh or the article that got you fired up. What made them resonate with you?
- Make your audience **feel something**!

### 3. **Keep It Short and Sweet**
- Attention spans are like goldfish these days. 🐟
- Headlines and visuals can make or break your content. Make them catchy! 
- Use videos, infographics, or even quick gifs to grab attention fast. If it’s too wordy, chances are it’s going to be ignored.

### 4. **Add a Dash of Authenticity**
- People crave realness. 
- Share your personal stories or struggles, because let’s face it, we all relate to the messy parts of life. 
- Be you! Think about your favorite influencers—what makes them relatable? It’s their authenticity!

### 5. **Engagement is Key**
- Encourage your audience to share their thoughts. Ask questions, create polls, or throw in a fun contest! 
- Imagine your content as a conversation, not a monologue. You’re inviting them in, not talking at them.

### 6. **Timing is Everything**
- When are your followers online? 
- Jump on trending topics or use social media calendars to make sure your content hits at just the right moment. (It’s like catching a wave!).

### 7. **Create Shareable Content**
- Think about what prompts *you* to share. Is it humor? Is it useful tips? Maybe it’s a cute animal video? 
- Craft content that people will want to send to their friends. Make it easy for them to share your posts!

### 8. **Don’t Forget the SEO Magic**
- Use relevant keywords that relate to your content. This can help your posts show up in searches more easily. 
- Title your posts with enticing phrases. Get those keywords in action!

### 9. **Learning from Others**
- Check out what’s working for others in your niche. 
- What types of posts get the most shares? You might find a gem of inspiration! Just remember, the goal isn’t to copy, but to **get inspired**.

So, what do you think? Is creating viral content really as straightforward as this list makes it sound? Could some of this be the missing link in tuning into what your audience really craves?

I met this Korean guy during a business trip a while back. We clicked instantly—not in a fireworks way, but in a slow, steady, warm kind of vibe. I’m a foreigner, by the way, and we’re both in our late 20s/early 30s.

Here’s what he’s done for me over the past few months:
	•	When I visited Seoul, he picked me up at the airport—even though it was late at night.
	•	He took me around his favorite spots, including his go-to mountain where he said he goes when he’s stressed. He said it was special to him.
	•	Every time we hung out, he made sure I got home safe. He’d hail a cab, walk me to the door, or even wait for me to text that I arrived okay.
	•	He once hugged me tightly and kissed me gently before saying goodbye—but never tried anything beyond that, which I appreciated since I’ve always been clear about my boundaries.
	•	He treats me like someone important. When I get sick or tired, he notices right away and tells me to rest or eat something good.
	•	When I asked him to model for my brand (I own a small fashion biz), he didn’t hesitate. He adjusted his schedule to fit mine.
	•	He sends me photos of the sky, food he’s eating, or random cute things he says reminded him of me.
	•	One time I casually mentioned wanting to eat something, and the next day, he sent it to me.
	•	He always says things like “I’m your forever friend,” or “I’ll always be here”—sweet, yes, but vague enough to confuse me.
	•	He remembers small details—like my favorite coffee, my scent, or the exact date of something I told him once in passing.

But here’s the thing… he never directly says he likes me.

And as much as all these sweet things melt my heart, it’s also driving me a little crazy not knowing if he’s just naturally kind or if he sees me as something more. My friends say no man would do all that for someone he doesn’t care about deeply.

So Reddit, what do you think? Is he just a really good guy, or does he actually like me but doesn’t want to say it outright?

1kry99n,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalOptimism/comments/1kry99n/daily_dose_of_optimism_52125/,Daily Dose of Optimism - (5/21/25),"Good morning,

Grab a coffee and start your day off with some optimism. Each morning, I will share a few recent optimistic news articles in various sections so you can start your day off in a hopeful mood rather than being all doomy and gloomy.  


* “Wholly Optimistic” are stories that for the most part that should leave you feeling good after reading them without much of a caveat.
* “Cautiously Optimistic” are stories that can have caveats or may be things that could turn out bad, but for right now, are good.
* “I Dissent” are stories of protests or certain figures speaking out against bad policies or injustices.
* “Take the Edge Off” are stories that are feel good and may deal with topics that are less partisan or heated.

Here are this morning’s optimistic stories:

I have 11 months left until my ETS date. I have about 30 credits to my name just from civilian school. I want to do the Active Duty Option which requires me to finish my bachelor's degree within 2 years (21 months). If I want to get the credits I need to qualify for ADO, I'm sure I have to at least extend. From my understanding, on June 1st extensions are going away.

The reason I want to do ADO is to maintain active duty benefits for my family more so than anything while still being able to make a significant career change. I've got 6 years TIS and am sitting at E5, and from what I've heard this is about the time that I have to decide if I want to just keep climbing the enlisted ladder or make the change. Not saying it's impossible later, just might not be worth it. For instance I knew an E8 with just over 20 years TIS who did G2G but ended up not staying and subsequently not achieving a higher pay rate as an officer than he made as an MSG so when he retired he reverted back to MSG.

My goal is to retire from the military. I haven't decided on a major or branch, I'm more just trying to see if I'm crazy to think there's a way I could rack up the credits I need to get my associates so I'm set to go into the ADO for G2G.

Three weeks ago, I left for a work trip to Germany. My wife didn’t want to come. “I’ll hang back, water the plants, binge some Netflix,” she said. She’s 39. I thought, “Okay, she’s a grown adult. She’ll be fine.”

She was not fine.

Day 2, she tries to make sourdough from scratch using a YouTube video and what she thought was yeast but turned out to be Epsom salt. The result: a rock-hard bread grenade that cracked our marble counter. She named it “Crumbzilla” and displayed it like a trophy.

Then, she decided to go “all raw vegan” for some reason and ordered 19 pounds of produce from a sketchy organic site. Half of it arrived moldy. The other half, she juiced. Exclusively. For a week. Just juice. No solids. She got so dizzy she mistook the laundry hamper for the fridge and put all our frozen meals in it. They’ve since liquefied.

To survive, she pivoted to eating Pop-Tarts and spoonfuls of peanut butter. Her justification: “Balance.”

Meanwhile, she stopped wearing actual clothes. Just bathrobes. The same one, every day. By week two it was 70% robe, 30% soup stains. The dog refused to cuddle her.

Last night, I land, exhausted, and I’m greeted by a living room that smells like fermented ginger and regret. She runs to hug me—robe flapping open, holding a jar of pickles in one hand and a half-knitted scarf in the other. Apparently, she took up knitting to “relax her stomach.”

This morning, I wake up to her whispering “I think I’m a kombucha now” and burping in her sleep. The dog has moved his bed into the bathroom and won’t make eye contact with either of us.

I grabbed my keys and said I was going out for coffee. The dog followed. He needed air. I needed therapy.

So here I am at a café with a silent, traumatized schnauzer, drinking espresso like it’s holy water. The barista asked if I wanted oat milk. I said no, because my trauma already comes in liquid form.

Hope your morning’s less... fermented.

I met this Korean guy during a business trip a while back. We clicked instantly—not in a fireworks way, but in a slow, steady, warm kind of vibe. I’m a foreigner, by the way, and we’re both in our late 20s/early 30s.

Here’s what he’s done for me over the past few months:
	•	When I visited Seoul, he picked me up at the airport—even though it was late at night.
	•	He took me around his favorite spots, including his go-to mountain where he said he goes when he’s stressed. He said it was special to him.
	•	Every time we hung out, he made sure I got home safe. He’d hail a cab, walk me to the door, or even wait for me to text that I arrived okay.
	•	He once hugged me tightly and kissed me gently before saying goodbye—but never tried anything beyond that, which I appreciated since I’ve always been clear about my boundaries.
	•	He treats me like someone important. When I get sick or tired, he notices right away and tells me to rest or eat something good.
	•	When I asked him to model for my brand (I own a small fashion biz), he didn’t hesitate. He adjusted his schedule to fit mine.
	•	He sends me photos of the sky, food he’s eating, or random cute things he says reminded him of me.
	•	One time I casually mentioned wanting to eat something, and the next day, he sent it to me.
	•	He always says things like “I’m your forever friend,” or “I’ll always be here”—sweet, yes, but vague enough to confuse me.
	•	He remembers small details—like my favorite coffee, my scent, or the exact date of something I told him once in passing.

But here’s the thing… he never directly says he likes me.

And as much as all these sweet things melt my heart, it’s also driving me a little crazy not knowing if he’s just naturally kind or if he sees me as something more. My friends say no man would do all that for someone he doesn’t care about deeply.

So Reddit, what do you think? Is he just a really good guy, or does he actually like me but doesn’t want to say it outright?

Or just because korean are really sweet naturally",2,1747834782.0,AskAKorean,6,1.0,False

1krxylp,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1krxylp/am_i_wrong_for_second_guessing_my_ldr/,am I wrong for second guessing my ldr?,"TL;DR- my (26F) current boyfriend (26M) lives on the other side of the world to me and I am unsure if I want to move to be with him. I had an encounter with an ex that has thrown me off and I don’t know what to do.

So basically for context- I (26F) dated my ex (26M) for about 3 years and he wasn’t a good boyfriend to me, he made me so anxious and he treated me quite badly. Like he had low emotional intelligence and wouldn’t be able to comfort me if I was crying (usually over something he did), he was neglectful and put everything else above me all the time. He never planned anything, never showed interest in my life, never gave me affection, pushed me away physically and emotionally, never complimented me (he said he didn’t want me to get a big head)- the list goes on. I genuinely had such low self esteem from being with him- my body actually rejected him in the form of being sick in the stomach around him and having painful acne for the majority of our relationship. However, this guy (call him Brian) was my first boyfriend and I loved him so much (and still love him a bit unfortunately but I’m not sure if that ever goes away no matter how badly you’re treated in a relationship). He is also in my friend group, so when I broke up with him in November 2023 it was really hard having to see him every weekend and we ended up sleeping together until basically march 2024. One weekend I got sick of still being treated like shit in my pursuit to get him to fight for me, so I downloaded hinge and I basically matched with a guy that weekend and he asked me on a date for a night that week (can call this guy Steve- 26M). We dated for a couple weeks- it was actually insane because I had never been considered like that or treated so well ever by a guy, so I kind of fell for Steve very quickly. Naturally I cut off contact with Brian and he began to spiral and beg for me back for the next few months, but I was so content with Steve that I rejected him quickly every time.

So the dilemma is that Steve lives literally on the other side of the world to me. Like I’m talking 24 hours worth of flying to see him. Luckily I work for an airline so I am able to travel for cheap whenever I want and I also put Steve on my staff travel so he could visit me/we could meet in other countries halfway to spend a week or so every 6-8 weeks (I have like no leave because of this lol). So from around June 2024 to now I have been in a long distance relationship with Steve. He is so gorgeous and kind- genuinely so gentle with me and my feelings, and nothing like I’ve ever experienced with Brian. Steve makes me feel so safe and loved and I never doubt how he feels about me- which is the opposite of Brian. However, I did catch him on hinge when he was on a holiday in August, which I was so upset over but honestly my self worth was so low and I forgave him for it. He said nothing actually happened and I trust him (yes I know this is silly). If this happened now I would 100% break up with him, but at the time we were able to move on from it.

So, my job contract ends in August and that means I won’t have staff travel, and therefore something has to give in our relationship. Steve’s family and friends live in my city, because he went to high school here then moved overseas for uni. He still works overseas. So him moving home is easier than me moving to his country, since he has a network of people here he knows. Obviously I don’t know anyone in his country except for him. This doesn’t really put me off moving that much, I would be excited to experience life in another country, as there isn’t a lot going on in mine. I would definitely miss my friends and family, and a lot of my friends will be getting engaged this year and next year so I’m going to be missing out on a lot of celebration with them. But it wouldn’t necessarily hold me back. The plan originally was for Steve to move back in December of 2024, but this got pushed to April, and now he has said it’s too hard to find a job in my city as the opportunities are limited here. I understand this but I fear I only stayed with him in a ldr because I thought he would be coming back to live with his family in a few months time. Obviously it’s very drawn out now but I eventually said id move after my contract ends to be with him (I only told him this about a month and a half ago when we were having a hard conversation over the phone and it came to a point where we had to ask the question of what’s gonna happen because Steve said he probably can’t get a job here- and I panicked a bit and said I would consider moving to him instead).

So last time we saw each other was for about 2.5 weeks where we went on a holiday together and then he came back for a week to spend time with me and also his family. It was an amazing time as always, but for some reason in the last week of being with him I literally thought to myself ‘I’m not sure if this is right- I should end this’. I can’t say exactly why I had these thoughts, but it has concerned me that I wasn’t as happy as I usually am with Steve. He went home a couple weeks ago, and since then I have been in turmoil, as I’m faced with the massive task of applying for jobs over where he lives, and sorting out a visa etc. I have felt so conflicted about this decision- my mum has told me I should do it and it would be the best thing for me- she wishes she did it when she was young. But my friends are more cautious and have told me to think about this a bit more.

So, on Saturday night I was driving 4 of my friends around and had to clear out the back of my car to make space for them. When I did this, I found a pair of Brian’s shorts that I had been meaning to give back to him for ages but never had the opportunity. I was in his area on Sunday and I messaged my best friend to ask if it would be rouge to text him and say I have your shorts, are you home so I can drop them off. She said it was fine and to just do it, so I texted him. It was a bit of a back and forth, but he told me he was out and next time he can give me some of my stuff back too. So I said okay and drove home. A bit later that night I get a text from him saying he’s in the area and can he come get his shorts. I agree and he pulls up, I hand him his shorts, and then he asks if I want to chat. I have a really chill, civil chat with him for a bit over not much, and then I get out of the car and go back inside. I honestly didn’t think anything of this, I just went straight to bed. The next day I get a text from him saying he has my stuff and can we get a coffee to swap it over. I text my friend again asking if this is a good idea and she says it’s fine, as I know it’s only friendly and honestly had the nicest chat with him the day before that didn’t lead to any weirdness or attempts at flirting or anything. I honestly thought it would be normal because tbh we see each other all the time anyway as we are in the same friend group- we have had to get used to being around each other. We had a coffee, I paid for my own, I gave him a pair of his socks back, and then I drove home. That night I did get another text from him saying he’s in the area and asking if I wanted to chat again. I was about to take my dog for a walk around the block, so I said he can just join me if he wanted to. We went for a walk, I made a comment like ‘it’s nice being able to be friends and talk normally instead of being opps’ and he agreed. I genuinely thought for some reason he was on the same page as me. I said bye and went inside.

The next day (tuesday) we had trivia with our friend group. It was nice and normal, then when I got in my car to go home I got a text from him. He asked to go for a walk; at which point I was thinking it is a bit much and I realised in that moment that he might be in a different headspace to me. I said to myself that I need to let him know that I’m in a relationship (he already knew this, but just to make sure he knew I literally just wanted to be friends). We went for a walk and then eventually it came up, so I told him I’m obviously in a long distance relationship and he said he knows. He basically then told me that he regrets how he treated me and has only just gotten out of a depression a couple months prior because he was so angry at himself for losing me. He said he always has hope that we can be together again, and at this point I started crying because he was (and he never did when we dated), and because he had never expressed feelings like this to me before. He told me how he felt the whole year, and how he was happy I’m happy now but he is also really sad at the same time. Hearing this after so many years of begging him to treat me right actually broke my heart, and I had a weird moment where I considered getting back with him. Eventually the conversation ended with us agreeing to not chat anymore, and the whole thing was a big misunderstanding as he thought I was intentionally trying to talk to him with the excuse of giving his shorts back. During our chat I did tell him he’s caught me in a vulnerable moment as I’m not sure what my plan for the next year is and I’m really conflicted as to what I should do.

Anyway I got in my car and drove home in dead silence, then went to bed crying and having an actual spiral about what I should do from here- I feel like my feelings for Brian have reignited and he has actually shown change which I had begged for the entirety of our relationship. I know that if I broke up with Steve I would want some time to be single and heal, and fully be by myself- but I can’t help thinking that it could work with Brian eventually. But at the same time I don’t want to lose Steve- it’s just a really hard situation at the moment with the move and I’m not sure about my feelings for him and haven’t been for a few weeks. I don’t know if I would regret breaking up with Steve as he’s the first and only man to treat me properly. But I feel such a pull towards Brian- he was my first everything and I have never actually stopped loving him- I actually always had a feeling we would end up together. I’ve seen growth in Brian that I never expected, and although I am really cautious that some of the ways he mistreated me are quite bad and should probably not be forgiven, I am tempted to give him another chance eventually. What should I do? I cannot sleep or function properly at the moment- I am a shell of myself and I’m crying constantly from guilt and anxiety. keep in mind I have had the conversation with Steve that I’m not sure I can uproot my life and I’m having second thoughts about moving. But at the same time I hate the thought of losing him- he is truly so lovely towards me, but why would I be having thoughts about breaking up with him if it was meant to be? please help!",4,1747834431.0,LongDistance,2,1.0,False

I did it. What would've been a 4th ER visit turned into well, a short 5hr sleep but I'd take that over spending 12hrs at the ER

Yes I still have my random chest spasms and have a cardiologist appointment in 3 weeks, but this is a win for me

* *The existence of a storm does not signify the absence of God; rather, it may reflect His purpose to unveil a deeper truth.*

Revelation is often gradual. God shows us more of who He is; not in the comfort of calm, but in the confusion of crisis.

* *Divine revelation is frequently a gradual process, unfolding more profoundly amid crisis than in times of comfort.*

In your storm, ask not only for deliverance, but for discernment. What aspect of God is being revealed now that calm seas could not have shown you?

* In the middle of your storm, don’t just pray to be rescued—ask for understanding. What is God showing you now that you couldn’t see in peaceful times?

Peace requires proactive practices. You can’t consume digital poison and expect divine peace.

* *Peace isn’t passive, feed your soul, not the noise.*

Storms don't negate previous miracles. In fact, they often follow them. Our faith is tested not by the absence of God but by our willingness to remember what He has already done.

* *Miracles may shine brightest before the storm rolls in. The real test of faith? Not feeling God, but recalling when He moved the mountains before.*

God doesn't need your life to be whole to work through it.

* *God writes His story through shattered pieces, not just polished pages.*

Peace is the result of practiced obedience and remembering God's provision.

* True peace is cultivated through consistent obedience and a mindful reflection on God’s past provisions.

Storms often follow miracles, but so do leftovers; symbols of God's continuing care.

* *Sure, storms can come after miracles—but don’t forget the leftovers. They’re proof God’s still looking out for you.*

What begins as a piece can become a powerful testimony or praise.

* A single shard of your story can shine into a song of praise, echoing louder than you imagined.

Peace requires conscious decisions: letting go, forgiving, stepping away from the mental noise. It is cultivated through spiritual practice; meditation, prayer, mindfulness, gratitude.

* Peace doesn’t just happen, it’s a choice. It’s the moment you release, forgive, and tune out the inner noise. It’s a garden you grow ,with meditation, prayer, mindful breaths, and daily doses of gratitude.

Peace deepens through contrast. Chaos teaches us the value of stillness. Every challenge becomes an invitation to return to peace, to practice the process of spiritual grounding.

* Peace hits different after a little chaos. Tough moments remind us why stillness matters. Every bump in the road is a chance to get back to center and feel grounded again.

Regular spiritual habits anchor the process of peace.

Meal 1: protein smoothie. I posted pictures at the end of how I made it, as this is a pretty typical post-gym smoothie for me. Step-by-step:
a) 100g frozen veg - spinach and butternut squash. I microwave it to shrink it down.
b) 100g frozen berries - I use a mix of generic mixed berries and local Haskap berries. 
c) 1 cup plant-based milk. I usually go for soy milk but lately I've been buying this brand of protein fortified nut milks because they are made in Canada.
d) 1 tbsp Canadian grown hemp hearts (I often use flaxmeal or chia)
c) 5g creatine - for muscle and brain health 
d) 1 tsp maca root powder - this is probably my only gullible ""brain boosting"" supplement that I've stuck to.
c) peanut butter vegan protein powder made with fermented rice and pea protein, peanut butter flour, stevia. 

Does it taste good? Not particularly but it doesn't taste bad. If I wanted a smoothie entirely for taste pleasure it would be a treat.

Meal 2: Shanghai bean curd fried in canola oil with hoisin, soy sauce, garlic and ginger powder. This is a pre-marinated product but I find it bland. Won't buy again. Side of local kimchi, pickled beets, cucumber and zucchini. Black coffee. Goat kefir.

Meal 3: Baked sustainably farmed (in-land) Atlantic salmon with dill. Sauteed mushrooms, garlic, local asparagus and fiddlehead ferns in olive oil. Side of red lentil kafta.

Dessert/snack: 150g 0% Greek yogurt with 10g peanut butter powder and a tbsp of no sugar added strawberry jam. Topped with pomegranate, hazelnuts, wheat germ.

It being my 40 doesn't have to be a big deal, it's just that I enjoy travelling for my birthday.

Currently, we're looking at Canada, mainly Montreal as it's relatively closer to us (we're fine with 7-8h flights but partial to direct flight). Having never been to Canada - is this a good place to start? Anything to know about August in Canada?

1krxvem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1krxvem/going_to_a_sleep_specialist_soon_what_were_your/,Going to a sleep specialist Soon. What were your experiences before being diagnosed with Type 2 Narcolepsy?,"I’m not here for a diagnosis ofc just to speak of my experiences and to see if anyone relates before they were diagnosed. I, 22, suspect I have type 2 narcolepsy and here’s why. Ever since I can remember, it’s taken me at minimum 30 min to fall asleep, average to being almost an hour or more. I used to lay in bed in kindergarten and just make stories in my head cause I knew I wasn’t gonna fall sleep any time soon. It’s not that bad now because I smoke weed, and that has played a heavy part in the last 3 years to help with going to sleep fast. When I was 9 years old I had my first sleep paralysis episode, terrifying but ofc that wasn’t the only time. I had sleep paralysis pretty much every morning or middle of the night at minimum 3 times a week till I was 12, and thankfully haven’t really had one since I was around 15. Also around 12 years old is when I started to become depressed, of course I had other complicated and stressful occurrences in my life that definitely contributed to it, but it was like night and day. A year before this I would go outside all the time, be heavily social, find new hobbies and activities etc. But i just didn’t want to do it, I wanted to just lay down and be comfortable cause I felt just tired. I used to like sports, but I quit because it was too exhausting to me. Falling asleep at night started to become even worse, to the point I gave up and would stay up all night in middle school. Eventually I got out of this habit, but I still had trouble sleeping. In freshman year I was prescribe trazodone to sleep, and I absolutely hated it. I would fall asleep yes, but I would wake up like I just got 30 min of sleep. More stuff, these aren’t all days, but some I just feel sooooo tired even with rest. Brain foggy, body exhausted and little interest in actually living life. As a kid while this wasn’t common, once in a while I would have bad night terrors with no recollection. One morning I woke up on the floor of my living room once with my mom stroking me hair, telling me I was at the top of the stairs in the middle of the night screaming bloody murder ( I was 7). 

For more info, I do not nap. I don’t want to nap because personally it takes time out of my day, and two they have never made me feel better. I don’t have cataplexy nor sleep attacks. Up until I started smoking weed, I would be awake in the middle of the night having panic attacks because I was so tired but couldn’t fall asleep. One of the most prominent symptoms that I can recall since I was little, is that I can fall into rem sleep immediately. When I do nap, let’s say even for 15-30 min, I can remember my dreams. Until I was older and was educated on how the sleep cycle works, I was surprised it’s supposed to take a few hour to dream. I can’t keep feeling sleep forever if I wanted, once I sleep for almost 20 hours, only getting up to pee or get water. Before college I would sleep up to over 12 if I wanted to, only reason I don’t do it often now is because I actually love the morning now, but I can still go to bed at 7:30 pm and wake up at 6-7 the next morning if I feel like it (like a treat). 

I’ve basically been a test rat for medications since I was a preteen for major depression, and no matter what medication I take nothing feels enough. I never feel the “energy”, the mental and physical. I currently take adhd meds, and they do help with focusing as I know I do have adhd (symptoms that have nothing to do with narcolepsy), but I don’t get energy with them either (though that’s a good thing cause that means I’m supposed to take the meds ig). I’m currently on 5 mg Abilify, and it helps with my irritability and anxiety, but not with mental and physical energy and motivation. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve contemplated if I’ll ever feel better or “normal”, I can’t keep feeling tired all the time. I can’t keep having coffee just to feel slightly more awake, I can’t keep going from med to med just to stick w one cause it ‘kinda’ helps. It’s stressful and exhausting and I hope I get answers soon :/",2,1747834197.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False
1krxt2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whoop_UAE/comments/1krxt2r/review_as_a_runner/,Review as a Runner,"As a long-distance runner, I’ve always been obsessed with improving—faster splits, longer runs, better recovery. But I didn’t realize how much I was missing until I started using WHOOP. At first, I just wanted to track my workouts more precisely. What I got instead was a whole new understanding of how my body works—especially when it comes to recovery and sleep.

One of the biggest changes came when I started paying attention to WHOOP’s recovery score. I used to push myself hard every day, thinking that’s what discipline meant. But WHOOP showed me that on red recovery days, my heart rate variability dropped and resting heart rate was higher. Instead of ignoring it, I started adjusting—taking it easier on those days or prioritizing rest. The result? I actually started seeing better times, fewer injuries, and more energy overall.

Sleep was another game changer. I used to think 6 hours was “enough” if I had a strong coffee the next morning. WHOOP called me out on that with cold, hard data. It showed how sleep debt accumulated and how it affected my strain and recovery. So I made changes: earlier bedtimes, no screens an hour before sleep, and better hydration. Now, I wake up feeling sharp, and it shows in my runs.

The strain score also taught me how to be more strategic. On days I had a tough interval session, I could see how high my strain was and then plan the next day accordingly. It helped me find that sweet spot—training hard enough to progress, but not so much that I burn out. WHOOP didn’t just tell me what happened; it taught me how to listen to my body.

Overall, WHOOP became more than just a tracker—it’s like a quiet coach on my wrist. It doesn’t shout, but it gives me the signals I need to make smarter choices. As a runner, I feel more in control, more informed, and honestly, more connected to the sport I love.

I sampled via decants from trusted sellers, decants from friends, and sample vials from brands. All opinions are based on multiple wears. Please note that perfume experiences are subjective and your experience with a perfume might be very different from my own. Please sample before dismissing or investing in a perfume. These are very brief reviews so if you'd like to know more about any of these perfumes, please feel free to ask in the comments. Here we go!

  
**1. Amouage Guidance**  
😡  
Fruity sandalwood. Too thin and shrieky on me. Smelled like a skin infection. Hated it.  
**FB worthy:** ew no. Gave the decant away.   
  
**2. Amouage Journey Woman**  
🌻🌻
A nice honeyed fruity floral, with apricot, jasmine, and a minty toothpaste-like note in the opening that arises from the combination of saffron and cardamom. But very powdery in the drydown.  
**FB worthy:** no. I have quite a few fruity florals and am not really mindblown by this one. Also didn’t enjoy the powdery drydown.   
  
**3. Amouage Overture Woman**  
🌻🌻🌻
Sweet and fruity, with just a touch of spices, booze, and leather. Lasts all day. Amazing quality, but uninspired scent profile. This one was fun to wear but not outstanding or unique enough for a full bottle.  
**FB worthy:** no, pass. It’s not so incredible as one expects from the house.  
  
**4. Amouage Lilac Love**  
️️️️🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻  
Lilac, fresh cut green stems, chocolate. Weird combination but it works. Like eating chocolate mousse in a field of flowers wet with dew. Quite unique too.  
**FB worthy:** yes, although not at retail price. Got a good deal on a bottle and have upsized already.   
  
**5. Andy Tauer Orange Star**  
🌻🌻🌻🌻
Very very lovely combination of bright, juicy orange juice and sweet bitterness of orange peels, atop a bed of incense and wood.   
**FB worthy:** yes, if I can find a bottle at a reasonable price. Seems unlikely though   
  
**6. Andy Tauer Sotto de Luna Gardenia**  
🌻🌻🌻
Beautiful blend of white florals and vanilla, with the dry dustiness that’s typical of Tauer. Very similar to Tauer’s Golestan, the latter being richer and more floral.  
**FB worthy:** no, since I have a full bottle of Golestan.   
  
**7. Arte Profumi Harem Soirée**  
️️️️️🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻  
Insanely good. The stated notes are just rose, myrrh, and ambergris, but the perfume itself is incredibly sensual and complex. Salty, sexy, spicy rose, exactly like the orgy suggested by the name.  
**FB worthy:** Oh yes. Ran through the decant in about two weeks and grabbed a full bottle immediately. The bottle is breathtakingly gorgeous too.   
  
**8. Arte Profumi Samharam**  
️️️️️🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻  
Another deep love from the same house. Samharam is pure woody incense and immediately transports me to an abandoned, possibly haunted church. By itself it is a meditative, spiritual journey. Layered with literally any other perfume, it adds a sombre and sensual flavour that elevates the experience.  
**FB worthy:** Definitely. Made my decant last a long time and then bought a big bottle. Looking forward to having fun with this one in the monsoons.   
  
**9. Atelier Cologne Café Tuberosa**  
🌻🌻🌻
Charming blend of white florals and coffee, with a touch of chocolate and vanilla. To date the only coffee note that has worked on me.  
**FB worthy:** yes, since I found a 30ml bottle at a nice price. Won’t need more.   
  
**10. Atelier des Ors Cocoa Kimiya**  
️🌻  
New release. Cardamom and chocolate. Both of those notes need a rich, voluptuous base in order to work and Cocoa Kimiya doesn’t have that. The result is thin and screechy. I’ve always wanted one of the beautiful AdO bottles, but this one ain’t it.  
**FB worthy:** nah, pass.   
  
**11. Atelier des Ors Lune Feline Extrait**  🌻🌻🌻
This is a rather lovely spicy vanilla. With a touch of wood and incense. Both sexy and comforting.  
**FB worthy:** no. Too similar to Ani and Babycat, both of which I have.   
  
**12. Atelier des Ors Rouge Saray**  
️️️🌻🌻🌻  
Okay, this one is lovely. Sticky dates, some spices, a bit of booze, a dollop of patchouli, and a whole lot of wood in the drydown— Rouge Saray is an oriental gourmand. I love it, my partner loves it more. There is a similarity to Van Py Rhum, however, that makes this not an immediate yes for me.  
**FB worthy:** might be redundant, will have to do a side by side comparison with VPR. Will decide at the end of summer.   
  
**13. Bogue Maai**  
️️️🌻🌻🌻  
Animalic tuberose, and I mean animalic in the sense that it smells like a wild animal. Very dark, and a delight to wear for a few hours while I’m by myself. But would not be able to wear this in public because people would definitely judge my hygiene. And would not be able to wear this for a full day.  
**FB worthy:** no, would never be able to use up 50ml. Plus I don’t like the name. Quite happy to be able to use my decant now and then though.   
  
**14. Carolina Herrera Herrera Tuberose**  
🌻🌻🌻🌻
Especially in the opening and mid, this perfume is very like Black Orchid (which I love but only have a travelsize of). The main difference is the prominence of a grapey tuberose instead of orchid. In the drydown it takes a slightly different turn towards a rich vanilla. The perfume has a festive temple vibe that I adore.  
**FB worthy:** yes, I think so. I have too many tuberoses but this one manages to stand out. Plus I don’t have Black Orchid, so no redundancy  
  
**15. Carolina Herrera Gold Incense**  
🌻🌻🌻
Spice herby incense-vanilla. Is it lovely? Oh yes, quite gorgeous. Is it unique? Not really, there are too many perfumes in this same incense-vanilla-sandalwood family with only nominal differences amongst themselves.  
**FB worthy:** no, don’t think so. There’s nothing this perfume can do that Babycat can’t.   
  
**16. Diptyque Do Son EDP**  
️️️🌻🌻🌻  
Very pleasant musky tuberose, bright and a bit sweet. My mom loves this on me.  
**FB worthy:** not a big bottle, as I have too many tuberoses and Do Son is not very unique. I got a 10ml retail travelsize instead, and that shall suffice.   
  
**17. DS & Durga Debaser**  
🌻🌻
Green leaves, milky fig, and coconut. Quite uplifting and joyful. Barely lasts though, and doesn’t project.  
**FB worthy:** no. Too milky and sweet. Also too mild.   
  
**18. DS & Durga Pistachio**  
️️🌻🌻  
Sweet and nutty, with a strange bitterness like that of bitter almonds. Beautifully balanced.  
**FB worthy:** no. I love smelling it but do not want to smell like it. Will just smell my decant from time to time.   
  
**19. Goldfield & Banks Silky Woods Elixir**  
️️️️🌻🌻🌻🌻  
Delightful concoction of vanilla, fruit, and wood. This gave me joy from start to finish, and it lasted strong for a really long time. Love it very much. Significantly better than the EDP.  
**FB worthy:** yes, but cannot find one. Have bought a travelsize. That and the decant should tide me over till I get my hands on a full bottle.   
  
**20. Gritti Gossip Night**  
️️🌻🌻  
Another fruity vanilla, and quite a lovely one, but a bit too gourmand for my liking.  
**FB worthy:** no, not that memorable for me.   
  
**21. Guerlain Angelique Noire**  
️️️🌻🌻🌻  
Heartstoppingly beautiful herbal vanilla. The scent profile is one of the best among all my vanillas. Soft and ethereal. But it stays so close to the skin.  
**FB worthy:** no because ridiculous prices. Especially for such measly performance. But shall enjoy sniffing my decant (a gift from a dear friend).   
  
**22. Guerlain Feve Gourmand**  
️️🌻🌻  
Really nice spicy chocolate with a touch of booziness.  
**FB worthy:** no. Not outstanding enough for that price. Will definitely enjoy my decant though.   
  
**23. Hiram Green Shangri La**  
🌻
This one is supposed to be a chypre for those who are scared of chypre, but this reformulated version of Shangri La is screechy and messy beyond all sense. Did not spark joy.  
**FB worthy:** no. Gross.  
  
**24. Kilian Back to Black**  
️️🌻🌻  
Honey, booze, tobacco. Not really bad, just a bit too much. I may have learnt to enjoy it, but Back to Black is only really wearable in very cold weather. Which is not a luxury I have been blessed with. Very unsuitable for tropical climes. As a fan of Amy Winehouse, I do love the name though.  
**FB worthy:** no, unless I ever move to Iceland.   
  
**25. Kilian Love and Tears**  
️️️🌻🌻🌻  
Beautiful beautiful green jasmine. Like a sweeter A La Nuit. Love wearing it.  
**FB worthy:** no, because discontinued and impossible to find at a reasonable price. Bit too similar to other jasmines in my collection to warrant the outrageous price tag. But might get another decant when I finish this one.  
  
**26. Kilian Playing with the Devil**  
️🌻  
Yet another fruity vanilla, this time with a sweaty BO like texture.  
**FB worthy:** No. Meh.  
  
**27. Le Labo Lys 41**  
🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻
Holy hell yes. White flowers atop fluffy whipped vanilla and some musk. Simply gorgeous. Fell in love at first sniff. Delicate but powerful.  
**FB worthy:** oh yes. Finished my decant in like a week and upsized to a big bottle immediately.   
  
**28. Le Labo Ylang 49**  
️️️🌻🌻🌻  
Woody, mossy floral. This one is actually quite beautiful per se, even though it leans a bit masculine for me. Unfortunately I was wearing it on an evening that turned out to be one of the most traumatic evenings of my life, and now I cannot smell it without remembering that day.  
**FB worthy:** no, because of bad memory association, and also less feminine than I generally wear.   
  
**29. Les Indemodables Oranger Sirocco**  
️️️️🌻🌻🌻🌻  
Very high quality orange blossom soliflor. The opening and first hour are quite uninteresting— like so many other orange blossom perfumes. But holy hell the drydown is gorgeous. Like a juicy grapey incense. Very very attractive.  
**FB worthy:** jury’s still out. Does the amazing drydown make up for the somewhat boring opening? Bottle has not yet become available here. Will decide when it comes.   
  
**30. M Micallef Ylang in Gold**  
️️🌻🌻  
Yet another fruity floral vanilla. Quite pretty, but entirely unremarkable, and not too long lasting either. Ylang Ylang Nosy Be does this same profile much much better.  
**FB worthy:** no, not that special.   
  
**31. Masque Milano Petra**  
🌻🌻🌻
Lovely floral amber. Bright and sunny in the top and deep and incensy in the base. It sparks joy, but does it spark enough joy?  
**FB worthy:** undecided. Not right now. Maybe in the future.   
  
**32. Matiere Premier Radical Rose**  
🌻🌻🌻🌻
Stunningly beautiful spicy rosechouli. A juicier, brighter, sweeter, daytime cousin to Portrait of a Lady, but different enough that it’s not redundant to have both.  
**FB worthy:** hell yeah. Even though I have PoaL I needed this one too. Wishlisted it and then received a bottle for my birthday.   
  
**33. Matiere Premier French Flower**  
🌻🌻
This is Petit Fracas on steroids. The same fruity floral shampoo vibe. But where Petit Fracas is sophisticated and smooth and playful with its pear and chocolate notes, French Flower is aggressive and pushy and actually a bit chemically. Smells lovely in the air and garners compliments, but up close it is offensive.  
**FB worthy:** no. I have Petit Fracas and that’s way way better.   
  
**34. Memo Paris Indian Leather**  
️🌻  
Was fascinated by the beautiful bottle with the elephant art. I get what the perfumer tried to do, to capture the essence of the subcontinent with jasmine, rose, oud, and nagarmotha. Unfortunately the composition is terrible. Literal trash. Indian Leather is a thin screechy mess. Memo is just churning out rubbish now in their leather line.  
**FB worthy:** big no.   
  
**35. Memo Paris Winter Palace**  
️️️🌻🌻🌻  
Okay this one is actually beautiful though. A very bright orange opening, a heart of tea and mate, and an unforgettable balmasic base. Very unlike anything else I have.  
**FB worthy:** deeply tempted. But not very sure yet. It’s not the sort of profile I reach for very often, but I feel like I could grow into it. Such a dilemma.   
  
**36. Mugler Angel Muse**  
️️🌻🌻  
It’s Angel, but with chocolate. Not bad at all, but I still prefer the OG Angel, and this is too similar to warrant having both.  
**FB worthy:** no. Redundant.   
  
**37. Nasomatto Nudiflorum**  
🌻🌻🌻🌻
I’m in love. Nudiflorum is a fruity woody mossy leather perfume, incredibly well done. The opening is very very appealing— bitter green rhubarb and galbanum tempered by soft sweet wood. About 30 minutes in, the leather starts rising from the base and proceeds to get stronger and stronger. It’s a gentle, soft leather and for once I enjoyed a leather note thoroughly. Nudiflorum is what I wanted Indian Leather to be. Hauntingly beautiful, and lasts forever.  
**FB worthy:** deeply tempted tbh. I’m scared of leather and almost never wear leather perfumes, but feeling an unmistakable pull towards this one. Yet to decide.   
  
**38. Nishane Hundred Silent Ways**  
️️️🌻🌻🌻  
I agree that HSW is a somewhat basic designer-like perfume, but it’s also very lovable. Yes, the tone of the vanilla is similar to that of Black Opium, a perfume of which I’m not a great fan, but instead of BO’s coffee and liquorice, HSW has peach, sandalwood, and vetiver, which makes HSW a much better perfume than BO for me.  
**FB worthy:** maybe yes, but a small 15ml bottle only. The scent makes me happy, but it is basic enough that I’ll get bored of it eventually. So don’t need a bigger bottle.   
  
**39. Nishane Shinanay**  
️️️️🌻🌻🌻🌻  
Shinanay, like Maai, is a floral animalic, and they do share some similarities. But while the animalic aspect of Maai is sharp and acerbic, Shinanay rejoices in being earthier, rootier, more vegetal. The gardenia and mushroom notes together create a wet-earth smell, which is garnished by tuberose and other white florals. The gardenia, although not prominent, is realistic, which is rare enough in modern perfumery. On the whole a masterful creation.  
**FB worthy:** yes. It suits my personality. Have acquired a 30ml.   
  
**40. Nishane Vain & Naive**  
️️🌻  
Most underwhelming Nishane I’ve smelled till date. It is fruity, and that’s about it. Not screechy or artificial smelling or anything, the fruitiness is done nicely. But extremely boring.  
**FB worthy:** no. Meh.   
  
**41. Paradis de Sens Valhalla**  
️🌻  
I absolutely love mango and was quite excited about this one. Unfortunately it falls flat. Very soapy and artificially fruity— it immediately brings to mind a cheapish body wash. The mango note is not only not longlasting, it is more mango candy than actual mango.  
**FB worthy:** no. Very disappointing.   
  
**42. Perris Monte Carlo Rose de Taif**  
🌻  
I love this house, and Rose de Taif is rather well known, so I was quite excited to try it. Unfortunately the geranium is more powerful than the rose and it just doesn’t feel comfortable to wear. A bit too spicy and not very unique.  
**FB worthy:** no, pass   
  
**43. Perris Monte Carlo Vanille de Tahití**  
️️️️️🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻  
This one blew my socks off at first sniff. What a gorgeous vanilla! Rich thick pure Tahitian vanilla with the fruity floral touch of champaca and ylang ylang and the top, and a creamy musky sandalwood at the base. This has become my third favourite vanilla after Babycat and Ani.  
**FB worthy:** oh yes, hunted down a full bottle within a month of sampling   
  
**44. Perris Monte Carlo Ylang Ylang Nosy Be**  
️️️️️🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻  
Yet another huge love from this house, YYNB smells like a banana pudding with a topping of vanilla ice cream, served in a wooden bowl. This is the depth and playfulness I needed from an ylang perfume, and this is the best ylang I’ve smelled so far.  
**FB worthy:** yes, was gifted a bottle on my birthday.   
  
**45. Ramon Monegal Hazy Rose**  
️️️️🌻🌻🌻🌻  
A very unique rose— a very photorealistic experience of an actual rose bush, stem leaves flowers et al., wet with dew at dawn. Even among all my roses, this one really stands out because of how green and refreshing it is. Perfect rose for summer.  
**FB worthy:** yes, got this on Valentine’s Day   
  
**46. Unique Luxury Istanbul**  
️️🌻🌻  
An incredibly sweet floral gourmand with nuclear projection and longevity. Uncomplicated, its chief characteristic is ‘sweet’. I do love sweet perfumes, but would not like to smell this much like toffee in public. It’s nice to wear my decant around the house though.  
**FB worthy:** no. I already have Sintra, which does this exact scent profile with way more sophistication and depth   
  
**47. Unique Luxury Mashumaro**  
😡  
Worst of the lot. Smells like someone set some tyres on fire and then burnt some sugar and hair in it. What I’ll do with this decant now idk, I can’t inflict it on anyone else.  
**FB worthy:** Bruh. I’d rather have my nose surgically removed than smell Mashumaro again.

I’m looking for some advice on how to handle a situation at work.

I’m a floater at a childcare center, so I go around helping in different rooms. When I’m working with another educator, I always stay calm, focused, and try my best to support the team. Usually, I help cover coffee breaks (about 15 minutes) and sometimes a short washroom break in the afternoon (5–10 minutes). I really don’t mind helping with those.

But there’s one coworker I’ve been having a hard time with. Whenever I cover for her break, she always tells me, “I’ll be back in just a minute!”—but then she disappears for at least 30 minutes, sometimes longer. She acts like she’s in a hurry, but then doesn’t come back on time, and it leaves me alone with a group of kids. It feels unfair and honestly, a bit disrespectful.

Here’s the thing: outside of this issue, she’s actually really nice. She even gives me rides to work sometimes, and I appreciate that so much. I don’t want to damage the relationship or seem ungrateful, but I also don’t want to keep feeling stressed and left alone in those moments.

How would you handle this situation? Is there a kind and professional way I can bring it up with her or with a supervisor? I want to keep things positive but also set some boundaries.

Thanks so much for reading and for any advice you can give!",2,1747833704.0,ECEProfessionals,2,1.0,False

**Looking for a fresh take on the culinary mystery genre? ""The Bakery Boutique: Desserts To Die For"" by LaToya Lawrence deserves a spot on your TBR list.**

The premise: Jordanna runs a family-owned bakehouse where customers are mysteriously dying after eating her exceptional pastries. Detective Grayson Waylon is investigating these deaths, but there's a baffling twist—medical examiners can't find any evidence of foul play in the autopsies. The bodies pile up, all connected to the bakery, yet there's no smoking gun.

Why it stands out:

* The central mystery is genuinely puzzling. Without clear-cut evidence, the story avoids the typical procedural formula where clues conveniently appear at regular intervals.
* It subverts the cozy bakery trope. Most culinary mysteries use food establishments as warm, comforting settings, but this transforms a bakery into something potentially sinister.
* The cat-and-mouse dynamic between Jordanna and Detective Waylon creates compelling tension throughout.
* It plays with reader expectations. Is this sabotage? Contamination? A disgruntled employee? Or something far more twisted?

This book should appeal to fans of Joanne Fluke's Hannah Swensen series who are craving something with more bite, or readers who enjoy psychological elements in their mysteries. It's got the warm, inviting bakery setting of a cozy with the psychological suspense of a darker thriller.

If you enjoy mysteries where nothing is quite as innocent as it seems and characters with morally ambiguous motivations, [""The Bakery Boutique""](https://selfpubman.com/book_directory/killer-confections/) delivers a perfect blend of sweet indulgence and deadly suspense.

Has anyone read this one yet? Thoughts?

We messaged back and forth, and he suggested this cozy little cafe for our first meet-up, which honestly sounded perfect to me. 

Cut to date day: I’m casually sipping my coffee, and he walks in carrying a giant bouquet of roses. I was flattered but also kinda... why tho? 😅 Anyway, we chatted, hit it off decently, and I honestly didn't notice much weirdness at first. Until...

He suddenly starts talking about how he's always dreamed of a big romantic gesture for a first date. I half-jokingly said something like, ""What, like a hot air balloon ride or something?"" And this guy's eyes light up like I just handed him the golden ticket!! Next thing I know, he's on one knee in the middle of this cafe, saying, not proposing—thank god—but offering a hot air balloon ride! I mean, in his mind it was gonna be this 'knight in shining armor' moment or whatever. 

I was like, 'That's, uh, super sweet but maybe a bit much for date one? Also... I'm scared of heights. 😂' Thankfully, he took it well and we both laughed it off before our awkward hug goodbye.

# Seeing Colors / Anhedonia

I messed up my routine by eating really late, close to bedtime. And usually what happens is that my stomach gets upset and I wake up sweating and in pain. On this night I woke up at 3 am and couldn't fall back asleep. I woke up with the *""Twilight Clarity""* I mentioned in my one year post. Like a *""vision""* or a *""window""* but in the dead of night when you're half asleep.

I laid there for the next four hours until my usual wake up time at 7 am, thinking about how amazing my life will be once this is all over, once the anhedonia lifts, and my *shade-of-gray* life is **filled to the brim with vivid colors** again. I think about all the people I'll reconnect with, what kind of person I'll be, earnestly picking up my hobbies and projects where I left off, and start working on my dream career. When this clarity happens, it all becomes **perfectly clear** to me and **everything makes sense**, everything I've ever struggled with suddenly seems so **trivial/easy**. But once I fully wake up that feeling disappears as the colors are *washed away* and everything goes back to being *grayscale*.

When I'm in that half awake state in the dead of night, after having slept for a while, the dysphoria and anhedonia feel greatly diminished to the point where I feel like I can just reach out and touch the other side.

I was sleep deprived the next day, and of course I had work lol. That day wasn't bad but the day after, even after getting a full night's sleep, I had one of the worst withdrawal days in a while. **Extremely low mood, irritated, sad, angry, fearful, wicked whiplashing emotions.** Seems to happen that I get one really bad day every two weeks now. But that means I'm healing! Just gotta focus on surviving.

I've struggled with anhedonia for a **very long time**, to the point that **I don't even remember who I was before it.** I don't remember what I was like, how I felt. I've just been an awkward, quiet ""introverted"" shut-in who does nothing but plays games and jerks off all day for most of my life. After working through my childhood trauma I started feeling a **consistent** and **strong sense of self** inside of me, and I started having clear *""visions""* for what I could/would be like without the anhedonia. The person I see in these visions couldn't be **any further** from how I am now, the **complete** and **total opposite**. That person is **extremely ambitious, self determined, self motivated, incredibly willful and daring,** and at risk of being **burned alive** by their **fiery passion**—**their desires.**

... I don't know if this person is real, I've never met them before. But I often **feel/embody** that person in my *""visions""* or *""windows.""* Not just when I'm half asleep, but while I'm fully awake and aware too. When it happens **it feels so real** to me, I feel that I am that person. Then anhedonia kicks in and washes it all away.

# Night Falls

I had a nocturnal emission recently, it actually happened the night of my *""worst withdrawal day.*"" I had exercised and was keeping my routine as usual, but I went to sleep with so much emotional energy that night, mostly anxiety, and could feel the tension in my body. I forced myself to drift off to sleep. I woke up to an emission. I don't even have dreams about sex anymore, if I have a night fall, which I rarely do anymore, the emission part just happens and I wake up. No recollection of anything remotely sexual in my dreams. I believe this is a sign that those neuronal pathways for PMO have been significantly pruned/rewired. Also I only have nocturnal emissions when I go to bed emotionally charged or stressed out. I think they are predictable in theory and avoidable if you can calm down before going to bed. And also if you are thinking of sexual thoughts and are being aroused just before falling asleep, you are much more likely to have one.

In terms of *""do they count as a relapse?""* as long as you are not trying to have them, I don't think they hurt progress. They just make me feel a little weaker the next day when I exercise. It seems the brain uses nocturnal emissions/wet dreams as a stress relieving mechanism when necessary, and it only happens because you are overwhelmed/stressed out. You circuitry in your brain that's been reinforced by years of PMO, you used PMO to relieve stress, so when you are unconscious and stressed out, that circuit gets activated. So if you want to reduce the frequency of them, you need healthy stress relieving habits and complete abstinence.

# Asthma Update

My asthma got worse since the last post, stabilized, and just this week seems to be getting better. I'm able to exercise comfortably without using an inhaler, same with working most of the time. The severity is just less, I think that means my physiology is adapting. I still have a ways to go and I hypostatize that I won't be able to fully adapt and stop having asthma until I fully reboot from PAWS.

I'm living my life with the philosophy that all you need to consume to be physically and mentally healthy and at your peak performance is simply food and water. You don't need coffee to have energy and focus, you don't need nootropics to be more sharp or to have a better mood, and a lot of medicine is taken redundantly rather than critically. Medicine is good, but it should be your second option, when living a healthy lifestyle doesn't fix the issue.

That's why I don't want to use an inhaler, it's just putting a blanket over a problem I'm having with my health. I don't want to ignore the issue. I want to solve the problem without paying ridiculous amounts of money to greedy manufacturing companies. It goes the same with SSRIs and ADHD meds. They are an effective short term fix, but a long term solution should be sought after. This doesn't apply to something like antibiotics or vaccines, those are modern miracles that can save you life from a bacterial or viral infection the human body wouldn't be able to survive on its own.

# Sleepy

Lately I've noticed that I've become very sleepy. I can get 9 hours of good quality sleep and still wake up feeling like *""I'd like to sleep some more but I'm too rested to fall back asleep.""* I'll have pretty good energy for the first half of the day, but after 8 hours I'm hit with a wave of drowsiness. I'll feel like I want to take a nap but at that point it's 3:00 pm. If I take a nap that late I won't be able to keep my sleep schedule consistent. I can't take naps on my days off because it will screw me over on days that I'm working and need a full night sleep. My body has been strangely hungry for sleep in the last 2 weeks, more hungry than it's ever been during recovery.

Another thing I've noticed is that my baseline feeling of dysphoria that I feel all the time has gone down again. In the beginning of recovery I felt it constantly and it was intense, the *""acute""* phase. After 3 months it only lasts for the last \~14 hours of the day. After 7 months it was \~6 hours. At 10 months it was \~3 hours. And now at *(almost)* 14 months, it's only about an hour a day. Sometimes I don't even notice it. Most days are like this now and I consider them ""good"" days. I went from having ""bad"" days every day in the beginning to having only 2-3 bad days around the 10 month mark and now I usually only have 1 bad day per week. And they're not quite as bad as they used to be.

So I've started to feel sleepy all the time, I don't feel dysphoria often or strongly anymore, I have frequent *""visions""* or *""windows,""* my confidence has noticeably rising, and also my libido is currently the highest it's ever been since I was a teenager. I think these are all signs that I'm close to rebooting. The only thing left that I'm struggling with is anhedonia, and I think it won't go away until I *""reboot""* and my reward system fully recovers.",2,1747833552.0,PMOPAWS,1,1.0,False

1krxmc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1krxmc7/run_in_with_my_ex_is_making_me_question_my_ldr/,run in with my ex is making me question my LDR that I was already struggling with,"TL;DR- my (25F) current boyfriend (24M) lives on the other side of the world to me and I am unsure if I want to move to be with him. I had an encounter with an ex that has thrown me off and I don’t know what to do.

So basically for context- I (25F) dated my ex (24M) for about 3 years and he wasn’t a good boyfriend to me, he made me so anxious and he treated me quite badly. Like he had low emotional intelligence and wouldn’t be able to comfort me if I was crying (usually over something he did), he was neglectful and put everything else above me all the time. He never planned anything, never showed interest in my life, never gave me affection, pushed me away physically and emotionally, never complimented me (he said he didn’t want me to get a big head)- the list goes on. I genuinely had such low self esteem from being with him- my body actually rejected him in the form of being sick in the stomach around him and having painful acne for the majority of our relationship. However, this guy (call him Brian) was my first boyfriend and I loved him so much (and still love him a bit unfortunately but I’m not sure if that ever goes away no matter how badly you’re treated in a relationship). He is also in my friend group, so when I broke up with him in November 2023 it was really hard having to see him every weekend and we ended up sleeping together until basically march 2024. One weekend I got sick of still being treated like shit in my pursuit to get him to fight for me, so I downloaded hinge and I basically matched with a guy that weekend and he asked me on a date for a night that week (can call this guy Steve- 24M). We dated for a couple weeks- it was actually insane because I had never been considered like that or treated so well ever by a guy, so I kind of fell for Steve very quickly. Naturally I cut off contact with Brian and he began to spiral and beg for me back for the next few months, but I was so content with Steve that I rejected him quickly every time.

So the dilemma is that Steve lives literally on the other side of the world to me. Like I’m talking 24 hours worth of flying to see him. Luckily I work for an airline so I am able to travel for cheap whenever I want and I also put Steve on my staff travel so he could visit me/we could meet in other countries halfway to spend a week or so every 6-8 weeks (I have like no leave because of this lol). So from around June 2024 to now I have been in a long distance relationship with Steve. He is so gorgeous and kind- genuinely so gentle with me and my feelings, and nothing like I’ve ever experienced with Brian. Steve makes me feel so safe and loved and I never doubt how he feels about me- which is the opposite of Brian. However, I did catch him on hinge when he was on a holiday in August, which I was so upset over but honestly my self worth was so low and I forgave him for it. He said nothing actually happened and I trust him (yes I know this is silly). If this happened now I would 100% break up with him, but at the time we were able to move on from it.

So, my job contract ends in August and that means I won’t have staff travel, and therefore something has to give in our relationship. Steve’s family and friends live in my city, because he went to high school here then moved overseas for uni. He still works overseas. So him moving home is easier than me moving to his country, since he has a network of people here he knows. Obviously I don’t know anyone in his country except for him. This doesn’t really put me off moving that much, I would be excited to experience life in another country, as there isn’t a lot going on in mine. I would definitely miss my friends and family, and a lot of my friends will be getting engaged this year and next year so I’m going to be missing out on a lot of celebration with them. But it wouldn’t necessarily hold me back. The plan originally was for Steve to move back in December of 2024, but this got pushed to April, and now he has said it’s too hard to find a job in my city as the opportunities are limited here. I understand this but I fear I only stayed with him in a ldr because I thought he would be coming back to live with his family in a few months time. Obviously it’s very drawn out now but I eventually said id move after my contract ends to be with him (I only told him this about a month and a half ago when we were having a hard conversation over the phone and it came to a point where we had to ask the question of what’s gonna happen because Steve said he probably can’t get a job here- and I panicked a bit and said I would consider moving to him instead).

So last time we saw each other was for about 2.5 weeks where we went on a holiday together and then he came back for a week to spend time with me and also his family. It was an amazing time as always, but for some reason in the last week of being with him I literally thought to myself ‘I’m not sure if this is right- I should end this’. I can’t say exactly why I had these thoughts, but it has concerned me that I wasn’t as happy as I usually am with Steve. He went home a couple weeks ago, and since then I have been in turmoil, as I’m faced with the massive task of applying for jobs over where he lives, and sorting out a visa etc. I have felt so conflicted about this decision- my mum has told me I should do it and it would be the best thing for me- she wishes she did it when she was young. But my friends are more cautious and have told me to think about this a bit more.

So, on Saturday night I was driving 4 of my friends around and had to clear out the back of my car to make space for them. When I did this, I found a pair of Brian’s shorts that I had been meaning to give back to him for ages but never had the opportunity. I was in his area on Sunday and I messaged my best friend to ask if it would be rouge to text him and say I have your shorts, are you home so I can drop them off. She said it was fine and to just do it, so I texted him. It was a bit of a back and forth, but he told me he was out and next time he can give me some of my stuff back too. So I said okay and drove home. A bit later that night I get a text from him saying he’s in the area and can he come get his shorts. I agree and he pulls up, I hand him his shorts, and then he asks if I want to chat. I have a really chill, civil chat with him for a bit over not much, and then I get out of the car and go back inside. I honestly didn’t think anything of this, I just went straight to bed. The next day I get a text from him saying he has my stuff and can we get a coffee to swap it over. I text my friend again asking if this is a good idea and she says it’s fine, as I know it’s only friendly and honestly had the nicest chat with him the day before that didn’t lead to any weirdness or attempts at flirting or anything. I honestly thought it would be normal because tbh we see each other all the time anyway as we are in the same friend group- we have had to get used to being around each other. We had a coffee, I paid for my own, I gave him a pair of his socks back, and then I drove home. That night I did get another text from him saying he’s in the area and asking if I wanted to chat again. I was about to take my dog for a walk around the block, so I said he can just join me if he wanted to. We went for a walk, I made a comment like ‘it’s nice being able to be friends and talk normally instead of being opps’ and he agreed. I genuinely thought for some reason he was on the same page as me. I said bye and went inside.

The next day (tuesday) we had trivia with our friend group. It was nice and normal, then when I got in my car to go home I got a text from him. He asked to go for a walk; at which point I was thinking it is a bit much and I realised in that moment that he might be in a different headspace to me. I said to myself that I need to let him know that I’m in a relationship (he already knew this, but just to make sure he knew I literally just wanted to be friends). We went for a walk and then eventually it came up, so I told him I’m obviously in a long distance relationship and he said he knows. He basically then told me that he regrets how he treated me and has only just gotten out of a depression a couple months prior because he was so angry at himself for losing me. He said he always has hope that we can be together again, and at this point I started crying because he was (and he never did when we dated), and because he had never expressed feelings like this to me before. He told me how he felt the whole year, and how he was happy I’m happy now but he is also really sad at the same time. Hearing this after so many years of begging him to treat me right actually broke my heart, and I had a weird moment where I considered getting back with him. Eventually the conversation ended with us agreeing to not chat anymore, and the whole thing was a big misunderstanding as he thought I was intentionally trying to talk to him with the excuse of giving his shorts back. During our chat I did tell him he’s caught me in a vulnerable moment as I’m not sure what my plan for the next year is and I’m really conflicted as to what I should do.

Anyway I got in my car and drove home in dead silence, then went to bed crying and having an actual spiral about what I should do from here- I feel like my feelings for Brian have reignited and he has actually shown change which I had begged for the entirety of our relationship. I know that if I broke up with Steve I would want some time to be single and heal, and fully be by myself- but I can’t help thinking that it could work with Brian eventually. But at the same time I don’t want to lose Steve- it’s just a really hard situation at the moment with the move and I’m not sure about my feelings for him and haven’t been for a few weeks. I don’t know if I would regret breaking up with Steve as he’s the first and only man to treat me properly. But I feel such a pull towards Brian- he was my first everything and I have never actually stopped loving him- I actually always had a feeling we would end up together. I’ve seen growth in Brian that I never expected, and although I am really cautious that some of the ways he mistreated me are quite bad and should probably not be forgiven, I am tempted to give him another chance eventually. What should I do? I cannot sleep or function properly at the moment- I am a shell of myself and I’m crying constantly from guilt and anxiety. keep in mind I have had the conversation with Steve that I’m not sure I can uproot my life and I’m having second thoughts about moving. But at the same time I hate the thought of losing him- he is truly so lovely towards me, but why would I be having thoughts about breaking up with him if it was meant to be? please help!",1,1747833508.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1krxmaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1krxmaz/after_calling_my_teacher_babe_something/,": After calling my teacher ""babe"", something unexpected happened…","The babe thing was happened on 12 may The rest of the week? Absolute torture. People were roasting me nonstop. “Lover boy,” “Romeo,” and of course the ultimate—“babe guy.” Even my bio teacher jumped in, all joking like, “Do I get to be called babe too?” right in front of the whole class. I swear, I almost died.

But then… plot twist.

There’s this girl in my class—let’s call her X—who I’ve lowkey crushed on since forever, like 10th grade forever. She walks up to me in the canteen, smirking, and asks:

> “So… who’s babe?”
I was caught totally off guard, half-laughing, half-trying to disappear. I said, “Maybe she hasn’t found me yet.”

And she just leans in and goes:

> “Well, maybe she’s right in front of you.”

At this point, I’m frozen, blinking like an idiot. After a few awkward seconds, I manage:
> “So… do I call you babe now or later?”

She laughs, cheeks turning that perfect shade of pink, and says:
> “Maybe start with my name first, loverboy.”

We started texting that night. First just memes and teasing, but it got deeper real quick. She asked me what I’d be doing if I hadn’t slipped up in class, and I told her, “Probably still daydreaming about you from two rows behind.”

She hit me with a, “You’ve been daydreaming about me?”

I said, “Yeah. For a while now. Thought it was kind of obvious.”

She replied, “It wasn’t. But… I’m glad it is now.”

BRO.

We started opening up more — she told me she always thought I was funny but “weirdly mysterious” (her words, not mine). I told her she was like my academic motivation with eyeliner.

Then she asked something that made my heart stop a sec:

> “Would you ever actually call me babe?”
And I said:“Only if it means something.”

She replied:
> “Then maybe I want it to mean something.”

Cue me absolutely combusting.
Since then, we’ve been texting every night until we fall asleep. Random thoughts, dumb hypotheticals like “what if we ran away and opened a bookstore in Italy,” and little co
Compliments that lowkey feel like confessions.

And last night, it hit a new level.
She said, “Okay, so... serious question. If you were to take me out, what would we do?”

I replied, “Hmm, step one: I show up 5 minutes early ‘cause I’m nervous. Step two: we grab coffee. I try to act cool but end up smiling too much. Step three: we walk around, talk about everything and nothing.”

She said:> “Sounds kinda perfect. I like coffee. And guys who smile too much.”
So… yeah. We’re planning to go this weekend. No label yet, but there’s definitely something happening.

Accidentally simped in class and somehow ended up maybe pulling my crush?? The universe is wild.

> Should I ask her out officially or wait a bit? Advice needed fr.

1krxg1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1krxg1z/l_theanine/,L Theanine,"So I thought I'd share some light on what's helped me, or what I know has made a difference. 

I'm a coffee drinker, only one cup a day in the morning- no more than that because it can def affect my anxiety and I'm a health nut and rely on good sleep at night. 

I've had PMDD for as long as I can remember, back in high school I remember staying home from school literally laying in bed depressed not being able to get up, then as my period came and went- it's like I was a different person!

Anyways fast forward and I'm (happily) married with 3 kids and also stay at home with them. I'm a photographer on the side and seem like my life is always busy with something! Sports, photography, trying to spend time with my husband, spending time with the kids. It's hard trying to balance everything. 

I always get REALLY REALLY bad anxiety before my period. It starts usually 10 days before and lasts alll the way up until the first day of my period, or the day before. Then I'm amazing and my life is great again 🤣

ANYWAYS, I wanted to share the one thing that has worked and I also noticed a huge improvement on my symptoms- meaning absolutely no anxiety, intrusive thoughts,little to no stress etc.. before my period.

L- Theanine. I've heard it can be taken before coffee, when you're feeling anxious, after a panic attack etc. I went ahead and picked some up from Walmart and started taking 200mg a day- only the week to ten days before my period. I did that for 2-3 months and found the month I forgot to take it I could feel my symptoms returning. The months I took L- Theanine I was completely symptom free! 

Sometimes I forgot to take it and I can feel it. So I take it for a few days and it helps alot. I feel like I don't really need it when I'm not in my luteal phase but if I'm having a bad day or I feel my anxiety starting to kick in, I'll take 2 or 3 and I feel so much better. 

I also take magnesium right before bed and I found out it pairs well with l Theanine. And helps me sleep better and wake up refreshed! 

Just thought I would share something natural that seems to help. If you guys have any experiences with l Theanine or anything else that you swear by, please leave them in the comments. I would love to hear them! ",2,1747833026.0,PMDD,1,1.0,False

We recently purchased a Phillips 3300 at my office.  While the espresso drinks taste great, they are more caffeine than I am looking to consume on a daily basis (The office manager purchased Lavazza Espresso Barista Gran Crema Whole Bean Coffee Blend - the one that is actually for espresso, lattes and so one). This morning, I tried using my own pre-ground coffee the coffee setting. It was terrible. Like not even coffee flavored water. I tried it about 3 times as the first time it was not even tea colored. The third time, while darker, was still not what I would consider ""coffee"". Anyone use the pre-ground bypass with a better result?

This is during field work. This throw ended up being a little low - flipped to flat, went about 280. Wasn’t my best throw, I’m walking down a small incline in the video. I can get my Mamba consistently to around 300+, but feels like cheating because it’s so understable lol.

DI KO ALAM IF FUNNY BA TO OR HINDI PERO MAMATAY AKO SA HIYA PLS

My dad(M62) found my(F24) two dildos in the laundry while I was out. I’m dying of embarrassment at the moment and kind of mad that he went into my room to get the laundry when he knows I do my own laundry. I can’t even tell anyone bc its embarrassing enough as it is that my dad finding out I’ve been doing stuff with the toys.

He messaged me while I was out, saying he found my toys luckily before he could send the laundry bag to the laundry shop. I just reacted a “🥲” emoji to the message bc wtf was I supposed to say 😭 Then he sent me another message after, “I’m trading this with you for an ice coffee.” I think, he tried to play it off as a joke but I was so embarrassed I didn’t reply anymore.

And when I got home, he was like where’s my coffee? I said I didn’t get him any with a straight face and went straight up to my room to see if he left it somewhere my room but it wasn’t there so I went back down and asked him where it was. He reached down to his bag and I swear to God, I got scared that he was just gonna pulled out to dildos straight out but he kept them wrapped in a used shirt I had in the laundry. Thank god. Then he was like you’re lucky I found it before it got sent to the laundry shop. I just took em and went back to my room but i had to go down again so stuff and I kinda wanted to show it didn’t affect me at all.

For context, my dad’s a doctor. He asked me a bunch of questions like “are you using em clean? ‘Cause if not, that might be the reason you’ve been getting sick lately. ” and “do you use that little lotion(lube) whenever? You might get lacerations from that.” Jesus christ I wanted to the ground to swallow me. He also asked if my older brother knew about it and I said no he didn’t duh. He was like yeah don’t let him see those. He also got curious, I guess, on where I bought em and I told him I got it online and he asked, won’t that show up on the packing that that’s the item you bought? I was like not really. Lastly, he just told me to keep it somewhere safe and don’t let anyone else see or find out about it and use it clean.

I won’t be going downstairs whenever he’s home for a while now. I’m dying right now. It’s freaking weird enough to let your parents know you’re sexually acting but getting caught with the stuff you’ve using? I’m about to go dig my grave.",81,1747832769.0,MayNagChat,47,0.99,False

I'm going to be spending 3 nights on a festival campsite soon, as I'm delivering a talk at a festival on 3 of the days, so I'll get free entry. Anyway, it's a huge festival with thousands of attendees and performers/speakers, so I'll be on the regular campsite, accomodation isn't provided. It's not an issue. There are showers, toilets, and place to charge phones, but no hot water/coffee/food on the campsite itself. I like to wake up and have breakfast and a coffee right away, preferably while still in my tent, I don't want to have to go into the festival site first thing every morning to forage for supplies. 

What do you all recommend, I'd prefer not to have to buy a camping stove, I was thinking of taking bananas and croissants to keep in the tent, and maybe getting cold brew cans of coffee to have in the mornings, but if anyone has any experience of campsite breakfasts (including coffee!) and any solutions, help a newbie out!

Also any other camping tips welcome, I want to be extra cosy! I have a sleeping bag, popup tent (I've used it before, it's good), and a wool blanket!

For a bit of context, I have been a smoker from 15yo, for 8 years, at LEAST a pack a day. Well, I quit september due to health issues and health anxiety.

3 weeks ago I had to give the hospital a stool sample for my routine check-ups related to my (nasty) condition. I couldn't that morning. The nurse sent me back home and told me I had a 3h deadline to bring it to them, otherwise it will be a complicated process to start all over again - to make an appointment to my GP, bring the paperwork back to them, make another file for me etc. (not in the US, here mostly everything is still on paper and very annoying).

Well, I went to the store to buy some instant coffee that might help me. While at check-out, I saw the ciggaretes in front of me. I was stressed, worried and under time pressure so I caved. I bought a pack. My logic was that if coffee didn't work, I'd simply smoke one and it'll help me go to toilet.

Long story short, coffee was enough, I brought the sample to the hospital and everything was fine. I didn't need the cigarette.

But now I had a pack of cigarettes in my house.

Well, in the evening I lit a cigarette. The smell, the taste, the feeling, everything was awful. I puffed 5 more times and trew it away. I felt so god damn guilty, so dissapointed in myself, in my decision. I felt so freaking stupid.

Well, 3 weeks after and haven't picked up this horrible habit again. I didn't let that one time I was weak to  define my journey as a non-smoker. I might not be 8 months smoke free anymore, but I am glad and proud of myself I haven't relapsed.

Well, that was my little story. I just felt like sharing it, maybe it helps someone. Or maybe not and this is useless lol.",13,1747832249.0,stopsmoking,5,1.0,False

(Part 2)","""It works like a virus,"" Kerr rasped, his voice thin and cold. ""Spreading through bonds between people.""

Fear seized me. ""What is it? What's happening on this road?""

""Something old woke up thirty years ago. Started small—the boy, phantom cars. Got stronger, reaching beyond the road.""

""But *what*?""

""We called it the Devourer. Feeds on fear, regret, guilt. Trapped under Bearfort Mountain, but it's breaking free, bit by bit. Every person it breaks creates another crack."" I thought of the thing that wore Amelia's face, how it knew my past.

""So the rules—""

""Started as trucker superstitions. Someone documented what worked. The card evolved. Company got involved ten years ago.""

""Oakmont Logistics?""

He nodded. ""They found they could harvest something from drivers—energy the Devourer releases. Sending people through deliberately, knowing some won't make it back.""

""That's why the pay is high,"" I murmured, feeling sick.

""Triple rate. Bonus for five nights. Survivors develop resistance. Useful in other ways.""

""What ways?""

Kerr's image flickered. ""Look at your dashcam footage from Dead Man's Curve again. You'll understand.""

Back in the truck, I rewound. The footage showed a figure filming the drowned boy encounter. ""They're studying it,"" I whispered. ""Using drivers as test subjects.""

Kerr sat beside me, solidifying as dawn approached, boundaries thinning. ""How do I get out? Protect my daughter?""

""Complete the route. Make the delivery. But don't come back tomorrow night.""

""That simple?""

""No. The Devourer will try to stop you now you know. Oakmont won't let their investment go easily.""

""Investment? I'm just a driver.""

""You've survived encounters that kill most. You're valuable. And you've seen too much.""

The radio crackled to life—Vince, my dispatcher. ""Driver Dellacroce, respond. Off-route. Problem?""

Kerr put a finger to his lips. ""No problem. Detour around a washout. Back on track.""

""Roger. Return time moved up. Need you back by 6 AM for urgent pickup.""

""Copy that. Should make it.""

The radio clicked off. ""They know,"" Kerr said. ""Tracking the dashcam. When reality splits, they see both versions.""

""So what?""

""Complete this route. Get to your daughter before they do. The connection works both ways—it reached her through you, you can find her through it."" He pulled out a small, black stone with blue swirls. ""Take this. Fragment from the Devourer's prison. Helps see illusions, masks your presence off Clinton Road. Buys time.""

I took the warm stone. ""Why help me?""

His form flickered. ""Twenty-five years trapped changes a man. Watched too many drivers die. Families destroyed when the Devourer followed connections home. Oakmont knows. Cleans up, calls them accidents. For their energy harvesting.""

""Stop it permanently?""

""You don't. Not alone. Save your daughter and yourself. Follow the camera's path exactly. At the paper mill, deliver normally. Act like nothing's wrong.""

""And then?""

""Drive south. Don't go home. Don't go to your ex-wife's. Find your daughter at school today and run. Use the stone to hide your trail.""

""How long?""

Kerr was barely visible. ""Until I reach the others. Resistance forming. Survivors. People who lost family."" He pressed a folded paper into my hand. ""Coordinates. Safe place in the Pine Barrens. Go there after you get your daughter."" His voice faded. ""Don't return to Clinton Road. The fifth night is when they take you completely.""

He was gone. I put the truck in gear, following the glowing route on the dashcam. The furnace ruins looked ordinary in the mirror. But the stone in my pocket pulsed.

The Sterling Forest paper mill loomed, concrete and smokestacks against the night. 4:03 AM on my clock, 6:18 AM on the dashcam. The discrepancy grew.

At the gate, Guard Wilson's eyes locked onto mine. ""Running late, Mr. Dellacroce. Expected you twenty minutes ago.""

""Detour. Road issues.""

He smiled thinly. ""Clinton Road can be troublesome."" He knew. ""Just potholes and deer,"" I shrugged.

""Indeed."" He raised the gate. ""Bay 4. Someone will meet you.""

I drove through, watching him stare after me. The loading dock was brightly lit on the dashcam, deserted through my windshield, save for a woman in a lab coat by Bay 4.

I backed the trailer. The air was unnaturally cold. The woman approached, flat-voiced. ""Sign here."" I signed. ""Unseal the trailer?""

""I've got it.""

Breaking the seal, I opened the doors. Not chemicals. A large object under a tarp. Cylindrical, seven feet tall.

""What is this?""

Her smile was perfect, empty. ""Paper mill chemical additives."" She pulled back the tarp—a glass cylinder on a metal base. Inside, dark liquid smoke shifted. She covered it quickly. ""Everything in order. Return cargo being prepared.""

""Return cargo?""

""Efficient use of resources. While we wait, coffee? Breakroom through those doors.""

Every instinct screamed trap. But I needed to appear normal. ""Coffee sounds great.""

She led me to a steel door marked ""EMPLOYEES ONLY."" Punched 1-9-8-3. The door clicked open. The breakroom was ordinary. Cameras in the corners. Coffee pot on the warmer.

""Help yourself."" She left. The lock engaged.

I poured coffee but didn't drink. Studied the cameras. My phone vibrated. No caller ID.

""Hello?""

""Don't react,"" Kerr's voice, faint. ""They're watching. Coffee's drugged. Don't drink it.""

""How are you calling?"" I whispered, turning away.

""The stone creates a connection. Listen—what you delivered isn't chemicals. It's a container for harvested energy. Return trip cargo is worse.""

""What?""

""A seed. Expanding their operation. Using you as courier.""

My blood ran cold. ""Where?""

""Near your daughter's school. No coincidence. Devourer sensed your connection. Path of least resistance."" Garfield, Cresskill. Less than an hour away.

""Stop them?""

""Don't leave with that trailer. Make them think you will.""

""Guard, woman—they know.""

""Not people. Extensions of the Devourer. Its awareness spreading."" The line crackled. ""Need a distraction. Use the stone.""

""How?""

""Break it. Last resort—lose protection."" The line died. The woman returned, empty smile fixed.

""Trailer loading. Finish coffee, get on your way.""

I raised the cup, not drinking. ""Special handling for return cargo?""

""Nothing complicated. Reach destination by sunrise tomorrow. Container integrity depends on timetable.""

""Where exactly?"" I asked casually. ""Manifest only had pickup.""

Her smile faltered. ""Coordinates provided en route. Standard for sensitive materials.""

""Of course."" I nodded. ""Restroom before hitting the road?""

She pointed to a door. ""Be quick. Window for departure is narrow.""

In the bathroom, I splashed water. The stone was hot, blue swirls rapid. Breaking it... I stared at my reflection. A faint blue glow around my silhouette. The stone was altering perception. An idea formed.

I slipped it back in my pocket. Returned to the breakroom. The woman hadn't moved. ""All set."" I left the coffee.

She escorted me back. Trailer doors closed, resealed. New manifest. ""Sign here."" I signed, deliberately changing it. She didn't notice.

""Safe travels, Mr. Dellacroce. Oakmont values your service.""

I climbed in, started the engine. Eased away. The guard raised the gate without checking. Too easy. They thought I was trapped.

Clear of the mill, I pulled over. Called Maria. ""Frank?"" Groggy. ""Five in the morning. What's wrong?""

""Listen. Get Amelia and leave the house. Now. No questions.""

""What?""

""No time. People are coming. Bad people. Connected to my job. Might hurt her to get to me.""

""Drunk? Is this—""

""Maria!"" I snapped. ""Never asked for anything since the divorce. Asking now. Take Amelia to your sister's in Hoboken. Don't tell anyone. Explain later.""

A long pause. ""You really are scared.""

""Yes.""

Another pause. ""Okay. We'll go. You owe me one hell of an explanation.""

""You'll get it. Promise. Hurry.""

I ended the call. Slipped out of the cab. Bolt cutters from the toolbox. Broke the seal. Opened the doors.

Inside: a glass cylinder, smaller, water cooler size. Metal base, digital readouts. Dark liquid swirled, absorbing light. A seed. Piece of the Devourer. Transported to a new feeding ground.

I closed the doors. Disconnected the trailer. Left it on the shoulder. Pulled away in just the cab. Phone rang—Vince. I didn't answer. Pressed the accelerator, south toward Cresskill. Toward Amelia.

Behind me, in the growing dawn, something seeped from the abandoned trailer's seams.

Dawn broke as I raced south on Route 23. Cab felt light. Stone cooled. Commuters appeared, unaware.

Phone rang constantly—Vince, unlisted, symbols. Turned it off. Yanked the battery.

Radio: Static, breathing sounds. Switched it off.

Gas station in Wayne. Ditched logbook, ID. Paid cash. Bathroom mirror—blue aura intensified around my reflection. Stone working overtime.

Black Tahoe merged onto the highway three cars back. Tinted windows. Took the next exit abruptly.

The Tahoe followed.

Side streets through Paterson. Trying to lose it. Stoplight—Tahoe one car back.

Phone powered itself on in the cup holder. Text message: ""The seed is germinating ahead of schedule. Your daughter is already changing. Come back to Clinton Road, Frank. Bring Amelia. We can help her.""

Turned it off. Yanked the battery again.

Forty minutes later, Cresskill. Amelia's school. Redbrick, white columns. Parking lot empty. Parked across the street. Called Maria from a payphone, shaking fingers feeding quarters.

""Where are you?""

""Turnpike, heading to Joyce's. Amelia's with me.""

Relief washed over me. ""Thank God. She okay?""

""Asleep. Frank, what is going on? Had to pull her out of school, make up an emergency.""

""It is. Noticed anything strange about her behavior?""

A pause. ""Nightmares. Talking about a mountain calling her. Thought it was teenage drama.""

My blood ran cold. Devourer connection established. ""When did the nightmares start?""

""Week ago. Right after... she tried to call you but you didn't pick up. Upset."" Matches my first night.

""Listen. Don't go to your sister's. They might look there. Texting you coordinates for the Pine Barrens. People there can help. Write this down?""

Fear in her voice. ""Frank, you're scaring me.""

""You should be. Be smart. These coordinates—go directly. Don't stop."" I relayed Kerr's numbers. Made her repeat them. ""Destroying this phone. When you get there, someone will contact you. Tell them you're Frank Dellacroce's family.""

""Who are these people?""

""Not sure. Our only chance.""

""Frank—""

""Meet you there. Keep Amelia close. No electronics. If she talks about a mountain or voice, don't engage. Change the subject.""

""Is she in danger?""

""Yes. But we're going to protect her.""

I hung up. The black Tahoe rounded the corner, moving slowly down the school street. Ducked behind a hedge. Two men emerged—dark suits. Tall, lean, gray hair. Shorter, stockier, shaved head. Not Vince. Not Oakmont I knew. Confident stride. FBI? Company security? Something else?

Couldn't risk staying. If they looked for Amelia, they'd find she wasn't there. Lead to Maria. Needed to buy time.

Jogged back to my truck. Headed north. Not Clinton Road. Oakmont's depot in Newfoundland. Confront the source.

Drive back north took longer. Morning traffic. Eight AM. Pulled into the truck stop across from Theo's Diner. Oakmont depot a quarter-mile down. Nondescript warehouse, gravel lot.

From the parking lot, unusual activity. Three black SUVs. Men in tactical gear. Scrambling.

A tap on my window. Barb from the diner. Red-framed glasses, lined face.

Rolled down the window. ""Shouldn't have come back.""

""You know about this? Oakmont?""

She glanced at the depot. ""Everyone local knows something's wrong. Since they started the Clinton Road route in the nineties.""

""They were feeding drivers to that thing?""

""Not specifics. Just drivers disappeared."" She studied me. ""You've got the glow. Seen beyond the veil.""

I touched my cheek. ""The glow?""

""Blue aura. Marks those who encountered the Devourer and survived. Means you're changing.""

Fear spiked. ""Changing how?""

""Depends. Some go mad. Some develop abilities. Some just die slow as it eats them."" She nodded at the depot. ""They're looking for you. Radio chatter non-stop.""

""Monitor their radios?""

Thin smile. ""Tracking Oakmont for years. My son was one of the first drivers to disappear on Clinton Road."" Understanding dawned. ""You gave me the rules card.""

""Try to warn everyone. Few listen.""

""Left their trailer on Route 23. Whatever was inside—""

""I know. Police scanner lit up. Hazmat dispatched. Too late.""

""Too late?""

""Seed cracked open. Footage online—dark spreading across asphalt. Three cars drove through before police closed the road.""

Implications hit me. ""It's loose. Spreading.""

Barb nodded grimly. ""That's their real business. Not harvesting energy—distributing it. Creating new feeding grounds.""

""Purpose?""

""Power. Influence. Fear changes brain chemistry. Makes people suggestible. Useful for those who want control."" She glanced over her shoulder. ""Leave. Now. They've got your plate. Find you here.""

""Need to get to the Pine Barrens. My family—""

""Know a back way. Forest service roads. Not on GPS."" Handed me a map. ""Follow exactly. Don't stop.""

""Why help?""

Pain flickered. ""Couldn't save my Jimmy. Maybe save your Amelia.""

My phone—battery-less, dead—lit up. Impossible. No number, no text. Image of a mountain silhouette against a dark sky.

Barb's eyes widened. ""It's tracking you. Stone isn't enough.""

""What do I do?""

""Need a permanent shield. People in the Barrens can help, but reach them first."" Reached into her apron. Small cloth pouch. ""Iron filings, salt, grave dirt. Old protection. Wrap your phone in it.""

I took the pouch. Sealed the phone inside. Screen went dark.

""One more thing,"" Barb whispered. ""Rules work both ways. Protect you, constrain it. That's why it wants rules destroyed.""

""How use that?""

""If cornered, recite the rules. All you remember. Creates a boundary it cannot cross.""

Movement at the depot. Men loading into SUVs. ""Go,"" Barb urged. ""South exit, behind the truck wash. Won't see you.""

Started the engine. ""Come with me. They'll know you helped.""

She shook her head. ""My place is here. Drivers still need warnings.""

""Thank you. For everything.""

""Don't thank me, Frank. Break the cycle. Save your girl. If you make it to the Barrens..."" Her voice caught. ""Ask if they found a driver named James Winslow. My son.""

""I will.""

Pulled away, behind the truck wash. In the mirror, Barb walked calmly back to the diner. Oakmont SUVs roared out of the depot.

The hunt was on.

Followed Barb's map. Narrow dirt road through dense pine forest. Truck bounced. Stone cooled. Protection fading. Recited every rule from the card. Mantra of survival. Boundary.

Pine Barrens ahead. Refuge. Behind me, something ancient and hungry clawed at reality.

Somewhere between, Maria and Amelia drove toward sanctuary, carrying the connection the Devourer needed to spread.

The pinewood cabin sits deep in Wharton State Forest, hidden by cedars and pines. Smoke curls from the chimney. Fourteen laminated cards hang on the wall. Rules.

I add the fifteenth—my own version.

""Dad?"" Amelia stands in the doorway. Hair in a ponytail. Eyes older. Nightmares faded, but she still whispers about mountains, dark water.

""Finishing up,"" I tell her.

She studies the wall. ""Think they'll help others?""

""They helped me find you.""

Maria appears behind her, hand on Amelia's shoulder. Not reconciliation, but alliance forged in survival. ""Meeting's starting. Kerr brought someone new.""

Thirty people gather in the main cabin. Survivors. Scarred.

Kerr stands at the center, park ranger uniform. Beside him, a woman in her seventies, red-framed glasses.

""Barb,"" I say, surprised. ""You made it.""

She nods. ""Depot burned. Had to run.""

Kerr raises his hand. ""Confirmed three new sites Oakmont established footholds. Seeds planted. Upper Michigan. Eastern Oregon. Central Florida.""

Murmurs.

""Government containment lost two men at Route 23 site last week,"" Kerr continues. ""Calling it a chemical spill. We know better.""

""Boy at the bridge?"" someone asks.

""None,"" Kerr says. ""Original manifestations dormant since Oakmont accelerated harvesting.""

I step forward. ""They're not feeding it. They're breeding it. Farming it.""

Silence.

""Rules protected drivers on Clinton Road,"" I explain. ""But rules also contained the Devourer. Bound it to specific behaviors, limitations.""

Barb nods. ""That's why they hired Frank. All of you. Test boundaries. Find loopholes.""

""Once they understood the rules,"" I continue, ""they exploited them. Created controlled versions to transport.""

Kerr unfolds a map. Red dots: confirmed sites. Black dots: suspected. Lines connect them.

""Creating a network,"" he says. ""Feeding grounds connected by human travel. Trucking routes. Perfect distribution.""

But what I've come to realise is just how much I was relying on coffee to get me through the day. The lack of coffee is making me unable to properly function and I think the dose of Concerta is so low that it's not making up for the caffeine drop. The last week has felt just like I feel on the occasional times I've given up caffeine in the past so I'm pretty sure the lack of focus and the general malaise is down to the coffee withdrawal and not the new meds.

... closing in on the NWTC, always an amalgam of the odd an unexpected. 
I speed towards the 551 Bus. I’m crouched on Christine, my two-wheeled girlfriend. She's a jealous beast. Much more so than the beauty back home, gently sleeping in our bed, warm and cozy. I often imagine myself next to her when the winds bite at my neck and I test the tensile strength of steel on my morning rides.
The 551, rusty and hulking, is moments from departure. I prepare for my battle with metal and springs occasionally called a bike rack. As I haphazardly emblazon the front of the 551 with a frame set silhouette, I notice a bustle of excitement further down the catwalk. ""Show the driver my pass"" I think, as I enter the bus, my eyes still fixated on the commotion outside. 
I collapse into my seat and peer out foggy, scratched glass to a wondrous sight. A small tent, manned with eager smiley folks clothed in parkas and mittens. A sign above reads ""Free Coffee and Donuts."" As I urgently peruse the happening, a memory triggers. Those green checkers that can mean only one thing; Krispy Kreme.
Do I have enough time to grab one? Will the bus driver let me bring it aboard? No time to worry. I must act. I jump to my feet ready and lurch for the door. Shhhlunk! The bus crashes shut and my fate is sealed. 
The 551 is now my tomb. Fluorescent amber flickers as I am forever locked away from the freedom of sweet crunchy bliss. I’m trapped a million miles away from lazy rivers of hot oil and cascading waterfalls of sweet glaze.
I turn to the faces of the dead. One snickering in my defeat, another sympathizing, most are apathetic as they peer into the void. As I make the long journey through the isles back to my cold and lonely seat, an old face looks up. The corners of its lips are glistening; the tell of a recent pastry encounter.

1krx3n3,https://i.redd.it/92y37fq1u42f1.png,🔧 So You Want to Play an Engineer?,"The stars may be broken, but someone’s gotta keep the lights on.

If you like the idea of making things work when they absolutely *shouldn’t*, if you want a character who lives in a haze of ozone and ingenuity, and if you’re the type to describe duct tape as “a design philosophy,” then the **Engineer** might be your ideal role in OtherSpace.

# 🛠 Who Is an Engineer?

An **Engineer** on OtherSpace is more than a fixer. They’re problem-solvers, tinkers, grease-stained lifesavers, and sometimes miracle workers.

They might be:

* A shipboard tech keeping a scavver crew flying
* A Pact loyalist keeping Iron’s End from collapsing... again
* A wandering inventor trading repairs for rations
* A cybernetic mechanic with a questionable toolkit and a flair for overkill

The Engineer doesn’t just maintain the galaxy - they *resurrect* it.

# 🔧 Why Play an Engineer?

Because broken things are everywhere. And broken things = story hooks.

**RP Opportunities:**

* **Ship repairs under fire** – Nothing like fixing a burned-out engine while pirates chew through the hull.
* **Crafting & invention** – Build (or break) gear, drones, power systems, even rudimentary AIs.
* **Personality conflicts** – “I *told* you not to jump without running a diagnostic first!”
* **Survival RP** – Jury-rig life support, rewire power grids, or build a plasma torch out of a coffee pot.
* **Scavenger synergy** – Pair up with salvagers to restore what they find (or repurpose it into something deeply unsafe).

# 🧰 What Can You Do In-Game?

Engineers on OtherSpace are embedded *everywhere*:

* **Iron’s End** – Repair station systems, haggle for parts, or invent crazy workarounds to failing tech.
* **Player crews** – Every ship needs one. Whether it’s fixing engines or building custom ship upgrades, you’re the heart of the machine.
* **Independent operator** – Traveling mechanic, fixer-for-hire, or rogue inventor with a garage full of scrap and a dream.
* **Pact-affiliated** – Serve as the technical brain of a salvage team or unofficial quartermaster.

# 🧠 Engineer RP Tips

* **Improvise boldly**: The more chaotic the fix, the better the scene.
* **Speak your own language**: Don’t be afraid to invent technobabble or name your tools. “Hand me the flux ratchet” *means* something to you.
* **Add personality**: Engineers can be stoic, hot-headed, anxious, obsessive, sarcastic - or all of the above.
* **Lean into failure**: When something breaks again mid-scene, roll with it. Unexpected problems = RP gold.

# 🔋 Engineer Archetypes (Pick or Mix)

* **The Burnout** – Running on caffeine, fumes, and guilt. Still the best at what they do.
* **The Tinker** – Can’t stop building. Constantly has four half-finished gadgets on their bench.
* **The Professional** – Former Stellar Consortium navy. Polished, precise, and a little too by-the-book.
* **The Back-Alley Modder** – Enhances people and machines alike. Not all of it is legal. Or stable.
* **The Scavver-Tech** – Salvages busted parts and makes them sing. Mostly in the right key.
* **The Devotee** – Treats technology with reverence. Maybe even religiously.

# ⚠ What Could Go Wrong?

* You fix the station's cooling system… by hotwiring it into the comms array.
* You upgrade a drone… and accidentally give it sentience.
* You forget to mark *which* fusion cell is unstable before takeoff.
* You work with salvaged AI cores and maybe one of them *remembers* you.

All of these? Opportunities for amazing RP.

# 🚀 Let’s Build Something

If you're the kind of player who loves:

* Sandbox creativity
* Story-driven tech drama
* Scenes that start with “So I took it apart and…”
* Characters who live in the gray space between genius and chaos

Then the Engineer is *your* jam.

This happened this morning between 4-5am. 
I know my spouse got drunk last night. I’m wondering if he went and bought hard liquor I know he was drinking beer. Any way 4am this morning, his alarm is going off and I nudge him a few times to turn it off. He gets up to go to the bathroom, when he’s done, he leaves the light on and door wide open. Comes back to bed. ( we have a 3 yr old and 2 yr old that sleep in our room next to our bed. It’s just more comforting for them) I ask him to close the door so the light doesn’t wake up the girls. He doesn’t answer so I asked if he heard me or if he’s ignoring me, he gets up, mocks me, then mumbles ‘go fuck yourself’. Ok fine, I didn’t say anything back. I just thought to myself there’s absolutely no way I will help out someone who is going to talk to me in such a way. I’m not getting up and getting his lunch or coffee ready if he will be disrespectful to me. So then about 40 minutes later im trying to wake him up so he won’t be late for work. He gets a little snappy with me after I tell him what time it is. He goes out to the kitchen, I guess to see if there’s a lunch made. There isn’t. So he starts slamming things, banging coffee cups around in a drawer, slamming the refrigerator door. He comes back into our bedroom looking for something and I ask why he’s slamming stuff around at 5 in the morning. He says he’s going to starve today. I told him there’s a whole container of food in the fridge. He says he doesn’t have time for that and he’ll just starve. I repeated myself again about the food in the fridge and he tells me again to ‘go fuck myself’. I told him as he was walking out the door he’s acting like a fucking child. And that was it. I’m pissed because my girls were in the same room as all this was happening, whether they heard it or not I always told myself I wouldn’t be in a relationship like this. And here I am. Tolerating some bullshit man child temper tantrums. I’m the one that always has to try to fix things. It will be turned back around on me somehow. There is hardly ever an apology from him.

This song Espresso by Sabrina Carpenter is sick. Someone asked: ""no good?"" No, very good! ""Sick"" is what the youth say nowadays. It means ""cool."" It's a good pop bop.



Who cares if your life has been tremendous pain and suffering?! All you need for mental health recovery is to hang out with Sabrina Carpenter - she's better than coffee. Imagine cruising around with her in a car that's filled with water - a ""pool car"" - that's pretty sick. 



They say 3 minutes of worshiping Sabrina Carpenter is narcissistic. Music videos are narcissistic to begin with. If you're gonna be narcissistic, why not go all in and cruise around in a pool car? Ya know what I mean? Don't pretend you're not self-obsessed.. Besides, that's what the people want to see. Haha.

I don't know what was wrong with Syd Barrett from Pink Floyd - if he had neurological damage from too much LSD - or if he was simply severely mentally ill and schizophrenic. But could a damaged mind have written Vegetable Man?! I don't think so. 



They say it's disturbing and not a lot of fun... Maybe so. But he's inventing genres. It's like the The Joker from Batman is writing pop music. Pretty epic!

I still eat other types of grain, mainly buckwheat (soba noodles are now my pasta) and rye (easily available as crispbread/knäckebröd etc here in Sweden) and oats (porridge in morning, oatmilk in tea and coffee).

1 week in, bathroom visits started being ""no-wipes"" (I still wipe of course, but there's basically no need for it) and 2 weeks in I'm really liking this situation. I'm less bloated and very regular, once a day.

Emotionally I feel calmer, less body-stressed. My veg and fruit intake increased by wanting more of it. I feel less inflamed, skin is clearer and joints hurt less. Past 3 days I've gotten great sleep, without sleep aids like magnesium or melatonin. A bit less brain fog, improving slowly every day.

I'm considering if it might have been that incomplete digestion of wheat proteins triggered my immune system and also made for bad stool consistency? I seem to tolerate the other glutens just fine.

F38, diagnosed Hashimotos and Raynauds, suspected MAST activation syndrome. Family history on mothers side includes SLE, MS, RA, and more, on all the women. We got some autoimmune stuff going on for sure. I should probably get an ANA-test.

Possible other changes that are affecting results: Boswellia 2000mg week 3. I don't think that affects stool tho.

So anyway, it's well worth a try, especially if you live in a country where the wheat-free options are so easily available and cheap :). I don't really feel like I did a big change and it hasn't affected our grocery bills, but I feel a lot better already.",2,1747831747.0,Biohackers,2,1.0,False

My husband and I have been married for a year and a half. He was divorced for 3 years, separated for 6 when we began dating. The ex-wife has had trouble accepting the fact that I'm in the kids lives from the beginning. The first time she found out I existed she caused a big scene between her and my husband. Was telling and screaming about him introducing me to the kids without her knowing. We took a trip to visit family in which we brought the kids and she demanded her kids stay with family and were not allowed to stay with us. Eventually her and I met for coffee and everything seemed good. She seemed like she would be cool. Then we got married. We eloped. Then at some point she stopped communication. The woman refuses to acknowledge my presence or speak to me. Even in front of her kids. She doesn't even speak to my daughter who is 15 and well aware. She even refuses to allow me to bring the kids to the doctor when they are sick asked in our possession. Her words are I'm to be a last resort. If the oldest is in town and visits our home, she refuses to let the younger siblings come over if it's her week with them. But we allow her to take them to functions with her family on our weeks all the time. We are around each other when either of the kids have functions for school or extracurricular. She still does not speak to me yet I'm not bothered by it. However now the eldest has graduated and asked to have a party at our home. It's assumed she will be invited. We recently attended graduation out of state and he had a graduation dinner there for those who attended, in which again she did but speak to me. 

We are already totem because we've already spent thousands attending the graduation out of state and paying for a dinner which included her family. She helps to pay for nothing. And I'm also tired of him being treated like an ATM. I told my husband I was okay with the party but did not feel comfortable inviting her into my home. I feel that would make it seem like her behavior is acceptable. I understand we're in this for the kids but I draw the line when our home is brought into this mix. If she were respectful I would not have an issue. But I simply can't allies a person who doesn't even speak to me when less than 5 get away into my home. Am I wrong?

Keep in mind my relationship with all of their kids is great. They have shared custody so they live with us every other week for a week. We even joke about how I know more than him because of time I spend with them while he's working. Which is likely why the party was asked to be at our home in the first place. However I'm also uncomfortable with us taking on the financial burden of it knowing this woman will have a grand time in my home and ignore my presence at the same time.",5,1747831402.0,Stepmom,9,0.86,False

I’m looking to make some new friends — especially other girls who might be interested in trying out Pilates classes with me! I’m a total beginner, so if you are too, even better.

Outside of that, I’m really into exploring new cafes, drinking matcha or coffee (open to anything really), and just trying out what Brisbane has to offer. I’m in that “new city, say yes to everything” phase — except anything illegal 🤣 

If you’re also looking for a Pilates buddy or just someone to check out the city with, feel free to DM or comment! Would love to connect 💫",2,1747831337.0,BrisbaneSocial,1,1.0,False
1krwurk,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminineboys/comments/1krwurk/a_quiet_rant_ive_been_holding_in_for_years/,A quiet rant I’ve been holding in for years,"This is a rant, I just wrote this to let it out.

I am a man, grew up in a religious Middle Eastern country. Everything — and I mean everything — was and is about religion: what you eat, drink, wear, do — everything, literally. I was taught early that the only thing I should do is study. You have to, and you don't have another choice. I was put in an all-male school starting from first grade. Literally everyone in that school was male — no creature with an XX chromosome should enter that school, because that's what God wants, of course.

The only women I knew were my mom and older sister. I go home, and you have to study. If you didn’t, you would either be punished or get beaten (mostly by my mom — my dad never laid a hand on me). Throughout the year, I was allowed to watch TV for 2 hours each school day. In winter and summer break, I got to play with a PlayStation 2, after that my mom would remove because it would affect my school performance. Now keep this rate for 12 years. Nothing significant changed. If there is one thing I instantly knew, it’s that I must do it — not because I like it or want it. It’s just that if I didn’t do it, I would get punished. So I became very pragmatic. I did whatever it took to minimize the damage.

As any human who has feelings and hormones, I just wanted to have a relationship. And what does a guy who has almost never dealt with a girl in his life and only knew boys do? I don’t know why, with time I just liked feminine boys. I guess I liked femininity, and because there were no girls, I could only see it in boys. And here starts my problem. Not only is this a sin (in the society pov), but if anyone knew, I’m a dead man. When I was 17, I finished high school as the top of my class and got a scholarship to study medicine. Fast forward 6 years, and here I am. I’ve kept it a secret for about 9 years now. I will graduate soon. I will have an MD degree before I turn 24.

The funny thing is that I thought it was a temporary thing, but it didn’t go away. In med school, a few girls were interested in me, and I had the opportunity to have relationships, but I just didn’t want to, it felt like a roleplay.

A few months ago, I went to the USA to do  clinical rotations in a few hospitals. While I was there, I tried dating apps for the first time in my life and matched with a cute guy. He was everything I wanted — it was a dream to me. But after we talked a few times, I wanted to ask him to go out for coffee. I just cowered out. It was similar to a panic attack. Instantly, everything I was taught since I was a kid just kicked in (I can’t do this, this is a sin, I will go to hell for eternity, and so on). So I panicked and deleted my account and the app. I still feel horrible — not only because I missed a chance, but because of what that guy must’ve felt.

I finally thought I had the freedom I always wanted — and I did — but these ideas… they are implanted deep down. I just hope to get rid of them.

Again, I wrote this just to let it out. This is a temporary account, and I will probably not reply in the comments. Thank you, everyone.",3,1747831325.0,feminineboys,0,1.0,False

Carl, broken, bloodstained, and lost, returns to the bench where it all began… but this time, he’s not alone.
A man in gray. A cigarette. A truth too ugly to look at.
He calls himself The Narrator.
But he’s more than that.
He’s a mirror. A wound. A voice that was never supposed to speak — but did.
And Carl? He just wanted to forget. For an hour.

This monologue dives into identity, fate, and the strange relationship between the author, the narrator, and the character.
If you love dark metaphors, meta-narrative games, and raw emotion wrapped in cigarette smoke… you might want to read this one slowly.
Word by word.
Like it was whispered by someone who shouldn’t exist.
But does.

Monologue : 

The Narrator’s gone.  
So I’ll be your voice now.  
You should probably get used to that.  
  
Sorry—  
I forgot to introduce myself.  
I’m the writer.  
Yeah… that one. The name on the cover.  
  
No fancy words here.  
Let’s keep it raw.  
  
Carl walks to Station 13—  
the place where he first saw the woman he loved.  
He sits.  
Same bench. Same number.  
It’s always Bench 13, no matter how you look at it.  
Symbolic, huh?  
But hey, I didn’t write that part.  
I’m just reading what was already written.  
  
Carl sits there…  
and cries.  
It’s past midnight.  
No stars.  
Even the sky couldn’t bear to watch him break.  
  
Then — cold.  
That kind of cold you don’t feel on your skin…  
you feel it in your gut.  
  
A man approaches.  
Slow. Unclear at first.  
Closer now —  
Wait.  
That man…  
Damn him.  
  
Sorry. I wasn’t supposed to say that.  
But still—damn him.  
He wasn’t even in my damn script.  
Maybe that’s why he left.  
Tired of reading lines for everyone else,  
but never getting his own.  
  
He’s in a long gray coat.  
Matching hat.  
Brown pants, brown shoes.  
Hat pulled just low enough to blur the face—  
but that grin…  
yeah, that you can see.  
  
He sits beside Carl.  
Takes out a cigarette.  
  
“Want one?”  
  
Carl doesn’t answer. Just lowers his head.  
  
“No cigarettes, no whiskey… not even a curse unless Walter’s yelling.”  
“Even when you make a choice, you only think for five minutes.”  
“You’re amazing, Carl.”  
  
Carl looks up — stunned.  
  
Carl: “You… how do you know that? Tell me the truth!”  
Narrator: “Truth’s bitter. That’s why most people take their coffee sweet… and their lives with lies.”  
  
“You and I, Carl… we’re alike.”  
“Maybe it’s not even us. Maybe Fate just has issues.”  
  
Carl: “Who are you?”  
Narrator: “Funk or jazz? Or maybe pop?”  
Carl: “What? Just—answer me—”  
Narrator: “Why’d you love Amy?”  
Carl: “Who the hell are you?”  
Narrator: “When did you first meet Walter?”  
Carl: “What—what are you doing?!”  
Narrator: “Was Amy’s face a reminder of your dead mother?”  
  
Carl: “Why do you keep answering questions with more questions?!”  
Narrator: “Finally—a real question.  
See, Carl… answers rot.  
They change.  
They fade.  
But questions?  
They evolve. They stay.”  
  
Carl: “Who are you?!”  
Narrator (softly): “No one’s ever asked that before.”  
Carl (shouting): “Answer me!”  
Narrator: “Easy, boy.  
I forgot who I used to be.  
Now they call me The Narrator.  
My friends call me that.  
Well—what’s left of them.  
I tell stories.  
Yours… is different.”  
  
Carl: “You have friends?”  
Narrator: “Concepts, mostly.  
And the graves of the stories I’ve already told.”  
  
Carl lowers his head.  
  
Then—asks, shaken:  
  
Carl: “If you’re The Narrator… and you’re here…  
then who the hell is telling the story?”  
  
Narrator: “Good question. That idiot author who only wrote five lines of plot.  
I wrote the rest.  
A boring little script:  
‘You come. You cry. You leave.’  
But that’s crap, right?  
Even this version is dull.  
Because it’s just me talking…  
and you sitting there, looking like a backup actor in a one-man show from hell.”  
  
Carl stares — confused, lost.  
  
Narrator (calm again):  
“You know Carl, a coin has two sides.  
Victory. Defeat.  
Life or death.”  
  
He flips a coin.  
It vanishes mid-air.  
  
“See, Carl…  
I don’t even care how it lands anymore.”  
“But you—  
you intrigue me.”  
  
He flips another.  
It lands upright. Balanced.  
  
Narrator: “Now that…  
that doesn’t happen.  
Not where I’m from.”  
“Even Fate is confused by you.”  
“And me?  
I adore the faithless.”  
  
He points to Carl’s bloodstained clothes.  
  
“You used to have this spark in your eyes.”  
“Now look at us.”  
  
He pulls Amy’s white scarf from his coat — stained red.  
  
“Five seconds, Carl.”  
“That’s all it took.”  
“Five seconds of hesitation.”  
  
Carl: “You… you…”  
  
Narrator (laughs): “No lines were written for you here.  
I guess that’s the irony.”  
  
Carl: “I don’t care about lines.  
I want the truth.”  
  
The Narrator freezes. Surprised.  
  
Narrator: “Say that again?”  
“You?  
You never wanted truth.”  
  
A beat. Then:  
  
“Alright, Carl…  
I’ll show you the truth from my perspective.”  
  
“Truth is like an old woman screaming in the street.”  
“But people are too busy listening to their favorite lie on cassette tapes.”  
“Or they just run from her.”  
  
“She once asked me,  
‘Why do you keep chasing me?’”  
“I said,  
‘Because everything else is a lie.’”  
“She said,  
‘And what about you?’”  
“…I couldn’t answer.”  
“Because it was a lie too.”  
  
“She ruined me, Carl.  
Beautifully.  
But I don’t show it.”  
  
“Truth is cruel only because it’s honest.  
The kind of honest that rattles your bones.”  
“She’s a mirror —  
but she always tilts at the wrong angle.”  
  
“Most people say they want her.”  
“But if they ever catch her…  
they panic.  
They don’t know what to do with her.”  
  
“So, Carl…”  
“Are you still chasing the truth?”  
  
Carl doesn’t answer.  
  
Narrator: “Just five seconds, Carl.  
You’ve always had a timing problem.”  
  
He stands.  
Train whistle in the distance.  
Smoke creeps in.  
  
And like that —  
he vanishes.  
  
But his voice lingers:  
  
“Whatever you choose, Carl…  
I’ll be waiting.”  
  
The train departs.  
  
On the bench:  
A red lighter.  
A cigarette pack labeled “5 Seconds.”  
And a note:  
  
> “You know, Carl —  
numbers are fate.  
But no one sees them that way.  
Light a cigarette.  
It’s not a sin.  
Not for people like us —  
people who just want to forget,  
for an hour.”  
  
  
  
Carl stares at the note.  
Then whispers:  
  
“Damn him.  
He knew everything.”  
  
He lights the cigarette.  
And yes—  
you already know.  
  
That was The Narrator.

1krwtvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1krwtvl/ldr_issues_not_sure_about_moving_for_my_boyfriend/,LDR issues- not sure about moving for my boyfriend + ex in picture,"TL;DR- my (25F) current boyfriend (24M) lives on the other side of the world to me and I am unsure if I want to move to be with him. I had an encounter with an ex that has thrown me off and I don’t know what to do. 

So basically for context- I (25F) dated my ex (24M) for about 3 years and he wasn’t a good boyfriend to me, he made me so anxious and he treated me quite badly. Like he had low emotional intelligence and wouldn’t be able to comfort me if I was crying (usually over something he did), he was neglectful and put everything else above me all the time. He never planned anything, never showed interest in my life, never gave me affection, pushed me away physically and emotionally, never complimented me (he said he didn’t want me to get a big head)- the list goes on. I genuinely had such low self esteem from being with him- my body actually rejected him in the form of being sick in the stomach around him and having painful acne for the majority of our relationship. However, this guy (call him Brian) was my first boyfriend and I loved him so much (and still love him a bit unfortunately but I’m not sure if that ever goes away no matter how badly you’re treated in a relationship). He is also in my friend group, so when I broke up with him in November 2023 it was really hard having to see him every weekend and we ended up sleeping together until basically march 2024. One weekend I got sick of still being treated like shit in my pursuit to get him to fight for me, so I downloaded hinge and I basically matched with a guy that weekend and he asked me on a date for a night that week (can call this guy Steve- 24M). We dated for a couple weeks- it was actually insane because I had never been considered like that or treated so well ever by a guy, so I kind of fell for Steve very quickly. Naturally I cut off contact with Brian and he began to spiral and beg for me back for the next few months, but I was so content with Steve that I rejected him quickly every time. 

So the dilemma is that Steve lives literally on the other side of the world to me. Like I’m talking 24 hours worth of flying to see him. Luckily I work for an airline so I am able to travel for cheap whenever I want and I also put Steve on my staff travel so he could visit me/we could meet in other countries halfway to spend a week or so every 6-8 weeks (I have like no leave because of this lol). So from around June 2024 to now I have been in a long distance relationship with Steve. He is so gorgeous and kind- genuinely so gentle with me and my feelings, and nothing like I’ve ever experienced with Brian. Steve makes me feel so safe and loved and I never doubt how he feels about me- which is the opposite of Brian. However, I did catch him on hinge when he was on a holiday in August, which I was so upset over but honestly my self worth was so low and I forgave him for it. He said nothing actually happened and I trust him (yes I know this is silly). If this happened now I would 100% break up with him, but at the time we were able to move on from it. 

So, my job contract ends in August and that means I won’t have staff travel, and therefore something has to give in our relationship. Steve’s family and friends live in my city, because he went to high school here then moved overseas for uni. He still works overseas. So him moving home is easier than me moving to his country, since he has a network of people here he knows. Obviously I don’t know anyone in his country except for him. This doesn’t really put me off moving that much, I would be excited to experience life in another country, as there isn’t a lot going on in mine. I would definitely miss my friends and family, and a lot of my friends will be getting engaged this year and next year so I’m going to be missing out on a lot of celebration with them. But it wouldn’t necessarily hold me back. The plan originally was for Steve to move back in December of 2024, but this got pushed to April, and now he has said it’s too hard to find a job in my city as the opportunities are limited here. I understand this but I fear I only stayed with him in a ldr because I thought he would be coming back to live with his family in a few months time. Obviously it’s very drawn out now but I eventually said id move after my contract ends to be with him (I only told him this about a month and a half ago when we were having a hard conversation over the phone and it came to a point where we had to ask the question of what’s gonna happen because Steve said he probably can’t get a job here- and I panicked a bit and said I would consider moving to him instead). 

So last time we saw each other was for about 2.5 weeks where we went on a holiday together and then he came back for a week to spend time with me and also his family. It was an amazing time as always, but for some reason in the last week of being with him I literally thought to myself ‘I’m not sure if this is right- I should end this’. I can’t say exactly why I had these thoughts, but it has concerned me that I wasn’t as happy as I usually am with Steve. He went home a couple weeks ago, and since then I have been in turmoil, as I’m faced with the massive task of applying for jobs over where he lives, and sorting out a visa etc. I have felt so conflicted about this decision- my mum has told me I should do it and it would be the best thing for me- she wishes she did it when she was young. But my friends are more cautious and have told me to think about this a bit more.


So, on Saturday night I was driving 4 of my friends around and had to clear out the back of my car to make space for them. When I did this, I found a pair of Brian’s shorts that I had been meaning to give back to him for ages but never had the opportunity. I was in his area on Sunday and I messaged my best friend to ask if it would be rouge to text him and say I have your shorts, are you home so I can drop them off. She said it was fine and to just do it, so I texted him. It was a bit of a back and forth, but he told me he was out and next time he can give me some of my stuff back too. So I said okay and drove home. A bit later that night I get a text from him saying he’s in the area and can he come get his shorts. I agree and he pulls up, I hand him his shorts, and then he asks if I want to chat. I have a really chill, civil chat with him for a bit over not much, and then I get out of the car and go back inside. I honestly didn’t think anything of this, I just went straight to bed. The next day I get a text from him saying he has my stuff and can we get a coffee to swap it over. I text my friend again asking if this is a good idea and she says it’s fine, as I know it’s only friendly and honestly had the nicest chat with him the day before that didn’t lead to any weirdness or attempts at flirting or anything. I honestly thought it would be normal because tbh we see each other all the time anyway as we are in the same friend group- we have had to get used to being around each other. We had a coffee, I paid for my own, I gave him a pair of his socks back, and then I drove home. That night I did get another text from him saying he’s in the area and asking if I wanted to chat again. I was about to take my dog for a walk around the block, so I said he can just join me if he wanted to. We went for a walk, I made a comment like ‘it’s nice being able to be friends and talk normally instead of being opps’ and he agreed. I genuinely thought for some reason he was on the same page as me. I said bye and went inside. 

The next day (tuesday) we had trivia with our friend group. It was nice and normal, then when I got in my car to go home I got a text from him. He asked to go for a walk; at which point I was thinking it is a bit much and I realised in that moment that he might be in a different headspace to me. I said to myself that I need to let him know that I’m in a relationship (he already knew this, but just to make sure he knew I literally just wanted to be friends). We went for a walk and then eventually it came up, so I told him I’m obviously in a long distance relationship and he said he knows. He basically then told me that he regrets how he treated me and has only just gotten out of a depression a couple months prior because he was so angry at himself for losing me. He said he always has hope that we can be together again, and at this point I started crying because he was (and he never did when we dated), and because he had never expressed feelings like this to me before. He told me how he felt the whole year, and how he was happy I’m happy now but he is also really sad at the same time. Hearing this after so many years of begging him to treat me right actually broke my heart, and I had a weird moment where I considered getting back with him. Eventually the conversation ended with us agreeing to not chat anymore, and the whole thing was a big misunderstanding as he thought I was intentionally trying to talk to him with the excuse of giving his shorts back. During our chat I did tell him he’s caught me in a vulnerable moment as I’m not sure what my plan for the next year is and I’m really conflicted as to what I should do. 

Anyway I got in my car and drove home in dead silence, then went to bed crying and having an actual spiral about what I should do from here- I feel like my feelings for Brian have reignited and he has actually shown change which I had begged for the entirety of our relationship. I know that if I broke up with Steve I would want some time to be single and heal, and fully be by myself- but I can’t help thinking that it could work with Brian eventually. But at the same time I don’t want to lose Steve- it’s just a really hard situation at the moment with the move and I’m not sure about my feelings for him and haven’t been for a few weeks. I don’t know if I would regret breaking up with Steve as he’s the first and only man to treat me properly. But I feel such a pull towards Brian- he was my first everything and I have never actually stopped loving him- I actually always had a feeling we would end up together. I’ve seen growth in Brian that I never expected, and although I am really cautious that some of the ways he mistreated me are quite bad and should probably not be forgiven, I am tempted to give him another chance eventually. What should I do? I cannot sleep or function properly at the moment- I am a shell of myself and I’m crying constantly from guilt and anxiety. keep in mind I have had the conversation with Steve that I’m not sure I can uproot my life and I’m having second thoughts about moving. But at the same time I hate the thought of losing him- he is truly so lovely towards me, but why would I be having thoughts about breaking up with him if it was meant to be? please help!",1,1747831253.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

Narrator: “Funk or jazz? Or maybe pop?”  
Carl: “What? Just—answer me—”  
Narrator: “Why’d you love Amy?”  
Carl: “Who the hell are you?”  
Narrator: “When did you first meet Walter?”  
Carl: “What—what are you doing?!”  
Narrator: “Was Amy’s face a reminder of your dead mother?”  
  
Carl: “Why do you keep answering questions with more questions?!”  
Narrator: “Finally—a real question.  
See, Carl… answers rot.  
They change.  
They fade.  
But questions?  
They evolve. They stay.”  
  
Carl: “Who are you?!”  
Narrator (softly): “No one’s ever asked that before.”  
Carl (shouting): “Answer me!”  
Narrator: “Easy, boy.  
I forgot who I used to be.  
Now they call me The Narrator.  
My friends call me that.  
Well—what’s left of them.  
I tell stories.  
Yours… is different.”  
  
Carl: “You have friends?”  
Narrator: “Concepts, mostly.  
And the graves of the stories I’ve already told.”  
  
Carl lowers his head.  
  
Then—asks, shaken:  
  
Carl: “If you’re The Narrator… and you’re here…  
then who the hell is telling the story?”  
  
Narrator: “Good question. That idiot author who only wrote five lines of plot.  
I wrote the rest.  
A boring little script:  
‘You come. You cry. You leave.’  
But that’s crap, right?  
Even this version is dull.  
Because it’s just me talking…  
and you sitting there, looking like a backup actor in a one-man show from hell.”  
  
Carl stares — confused, lost.  
  
Narrator (calm again):  
“You know Carl, a coin has two sides.  
Victory. Defeat.  
Life or death.”  
  
He flips a coin.  
It vanishes mid-air.  
  
“See, Carl…  
I don’t even care how it lands anymore.”  
“But you—  
you intrigue me.”  
  
He flips another.  
It lands upright. Balanced.  
  
Narrator: “Now that…  
that doesn’t happen.  
Not where I’m from.”  
“Even Fate is confused by you.”  
“And me?  
I adore the faithless.”  
  
He points to Carl’s bloodstained clothes.  
  
“You used to have this spark in your eyes.”  
“Now look at us.”  
  
He pulls Amy’s white scarf from his coat — stained red.  
  
“Five seconds, Carl.”  
“That’s all it took.”  
“Five seconds of hesitation.”  
  
Carl: “You… you…”  
  
Narrator (laughs): “No lines were written for you here.  
I guess that’s the irony.”  
  
Carl: “I don’t care about lines.  
I want the truth.”  
  
The Narrator freezes. Surprised.  
  
Narrator: “Say that again?”  
“You?  
You never wanted truth.”  
  
A beat. Then:  
  
“Alright, Carl…  
I’ll show you the truth from my perspective.”  
  
“Truth is like an old woman screaming in the street.”  
“But people are too busy listening to their favorite lie on cassette tapes.”  
“Or they just run from her.”  
  
“She once asked me,  
‘Why do you keep chasing me?’”  
“I said,  
‘Because everything else is a lie.’”  
“She said,  
‘And what about you?’”  
“…I couldn’t answer.”  
“Because it was a lie too.”  
  
“She ruined me, Carl.  
Beautifully.  
But I don’t show it.”  
  
“Truth is cruel only because it’s honest.  
The kind of honest that rattles your bones.”  
“She’s a mirror —  
but she always tilts at the wrong angle.”  
  
“Most people say they want her.”  
“But if they ever catch her…  
they panic.  
They don’t know what to do with her.”  
  
“So, Carl…”  
“Are you still chasing the truth?”  
  
Carl doesn’t answer.  
  
Narrator: “Just five seconds, Carl.  
You’ve always had a timing problem.”  
  
He stands.  
Train whistle in the distance.  
Smoke creeps in.  
  
And like that —  
he vanishes.  
  
But his voice lingers:  
  
“Whatever you choose, Carl…  
I’ll be waiting.”  
  
The train departs.  
  
On the bench:  
A red lighter.  
A cigarette pack labeled “5 Seconds.”  
And a note:  
  
> “You know, Carl —  
numbers are fate.  
But no one sees them that way.  
Light a cigarette.  
It’s not a sin.  
Not for people like us —  
people who just want to forget,  
for an hour.”  
  
  
  
Carl stares at the note.  
Then whispers:  
  
“Damn him.  
He knew everything.”  
  
He lights the cigarette.  
And yes—  
you already know.  
  
That was The Narrator.

An accident occurred two days ago at approximately 5:30 PM on the Kings Highway, heading towards the coast from Braidwood. A white Toyota Hilux reportedly struck a roadside bollard and rolled into a ditch, coming to rest on its roof.

The driver is believed to have lost consciousness after choking on coffee, which led to the crash. Thankfully, both occupants and their two dogs survived the incident with no major injuries.

Bystanders quickly came to the aid of the couple while emergency services were en route. One woman, in particular, was noted for her kindness and assistance—retrieving a lost shoe and offering comfort until paramedics arrived.

The occupants later expressed their gratitude to those who helped, stating they felt incredibly lucky and as though someone had been watching over them.",1,1747831200.0,Braidwood,0,1.0,False

Here are my rules:

* Two 45-minute workouts a day (can be back-to-back for longer tennis sessions). I currently do a mixture of weight training, running, walking, swimming, and yoga. I also do a weekly workout class like F45 or pilates. Additionally, I play pickleball or tennis about bi-weekly. 
* No alcohol. This rule inspired me to try a version of 75 Hard/Medium. I was already going sober for bar prep, and the toxic part of me was like, ""I'll just add the other rules.""
* One 20-minute session of a creative activity (drawing or other crafts). Law school and the bar was/is frying my love of reading, so I opted for something more creative. 
* 2 liters of water a day. 
* One progress picture a day. 
* Two weigh-ins a week. Mon/Thu.

1krwsmw,https://i.redd.it/chaa4b6cr42f1.jpeg,Wyoming’s License Plate Debacle: A Cowboy State’s Aesthetic Apocalypse,"Picture this: a beat-to-hell ’96 Mercury Sable, its bumper dangling like a drunk uncle’s tie, cruising down CY Avenue in Casper. The Wyoming sun hits that old license plate—warm blue, golden grass, a whisper of Devil’s Tower—and it’s like the car *belongs* to the landscape, a rolling ode to the Cowboy State. Now fast-forward to 2025, and that same Sable’s sporting a new plate so garish it could make a buffalo puke. Navy blue, red-and-white borders, a tourism slogan screaming “That’s WY,” and—sweet Jesus—a design where Steamboat, our beloved bucking bronco, looks like he’s sniffing a bison’s ass. This, my friends, is Wyoming’s licenseiii plate apocalypse, and it’s uglier than a roadkill casserole.

I’m sitting in a Casper diner, the kind where the coffee tastes like regret and the waitress calls you “hon” without meaning it. Across from me is a local gearhead, let’s call him Moose, who’s so mad about the new plates he’s shielding his eyes with his hand like he’s dodging a solar eclipse. “It’s not just a plate,” Moose growls, slamming his fist on the Formica. “It’s an assault. High-contrast white text that blows out at night, thick Photoshop outlines like some intern fucked up the scale. I’m driving my Sable, and this plate makes it look like I stole it from a sketchy Idaho pawn shop. It’s *wrong*.”

Moose’s not alone. Wyoming’s 2025 license plate, mandated by the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT) for every vehicle by 2026, has sparked a rebellion hotter than a grease fire at a chuckwagon cookoff. The design, chosen by a shadowy committee with zero public input, swaps the old plates’ soulful vistas—Square Top Mountain, Green River Lakes—for a state flag-inspired mess. Navy blue background, red-and-white trim, a stacked pile of Steamboat, a bison, and the state seal, all slapped with a “That’s WY” slogan and a travelwyoming.com URL. It’s like someone took Wyoming’s cowboy heart, ran it through a tourism board’s branding blender, and hit “puree.”

-----

The Crime Scene: A Design That Screams “MS Paint”

Let’s break this down like a bad brisket. The old plates were Wyoming in metal form: warm blues that echoed the sky over the Bighorns, gold tones that matched the burnt grass of late summer, minimalist numbers that didn’t insult your intelligence. A single digit—say, “1” for Natrona County—felt like a secret handshake. You saw a plate with “2” and knew it was Cheyenne, no explanation needed. It was poetry, the kind of thing that made a ’96 Sable blend into the landscape like a sagebrush tumbleweed.

The new plate? It’s a visual war crime. The navy blue is so dark it swallows light like a black hole. The red-and-white borders scream “state fair midway,” not “Cowboy State.” And the elements—oh, the elements. Steamboat, Wyoming’s iconic bucking horse, is stacked above a bison in what Moose calls “an ass-sniffing tangent.” The bison’s hindquarters are practically in Steamboat’s face, and both are outlined in strokes so thick it’s like WYDOT hired a toddler with a Sharpie. The state seal’s in there too, because why not throw in another logo while you’re at it? Then there’s the “That’s WY” slogan, a tourism board flex that feels like a bumper sticker for a state you don’t want to visit. And don’t forget the URL—travelwyoming.com—because nothing says “rugged individualism” like a website address on your F-350.

But the real kicker? The new numbering system. Passenger vehicles now get a “P” prefix (1P for Natrona County), trucks get a “T” (1T). “Oh, great,” Moose snarls, sipping his coffee like it’s whiskey. “I didn’t know my lifted F-350 blowing black smoke was a damn truck. And ‘P’ for passenger? Sounds like ‘pee.’ Real classy, WYDOT.” It’s like the state decided to tattoo “DUH” on every vehicle, stripping away the old plates’ minimalist swagger. Moose’s right—it’s the license plate equivalent of a bumper sticker with devil-sexy goddesses on one side and angels on the other. Pure ratchet.

-----

The Nighttime Blowout and the Sunglasses Defense

It gets worse. The high-contrast white text on the navy background, meant to pop, turns into a blinding mess at night. “It’s like staring into a strobe light,” Moose says, rubbing his temples. “The white blows out under headlights, unreadable unless you’re squinting like you’re deciphering hieroglyphs.” This isn’t just Moose’s gripe—other states, like Ontario in 2020, scrapped similar white-on-dark plates after drivers and cops complained about legibility. Wyoming didn’t get the memo. Moose’s taken to wearing polarized sunglasses in traffic, not for style but to survive the visual assault. “I’m shielding my eyes like I’m in a goddamn sci-fi movie,” he says. “This plate’s so aggressive it’s dictating my wardrobe.”

The design’s impact goes beyond aesthetics. Moose’s Sable, once a chameleon in Wyoming’s open spaces, now sticks out like a sore thumb. “That old plate matched the state’s soul—brown and gold, homie,” he says. “Now my car looks like it’s auditioning for a low-budget crime flick. I used to roll down CY Avenue feeling like I *was* Wyoming. Now I avoid Casper because this plate’s embarrassing.” He’s not exaggerating. Reddit threads on r/wyoming and r/LICENSEPLATES are ablaze with comments calling the new design “ugly,” “busy,” and “a tourism board fever dream.” One user summed it up: “It’s like WYDOT hired a graphic designer who hates us.”

-----

The Missed Opportunity: Montana, Hawaii, and the Art of Plates

Moose’s got a point when he compares Wyoming’s flop to other states’ home runs. Montana, with its dozens of plate designs, nails it—clean lines, bold landscapes, options that let you rep Glacier National Park or a vintage bucking horse without looking like a billboard. Hawaii’s plates, especially the Haleakalā National Park design, are straight-up art. “That volcano drips on a 4Runner like it’s painted in a modern style,” Moose says, almost wistful. “Why couldn’t we get an elk with a spliff in front of the Grand Teton? Wyoming’s the most beautiful state, and our plate looks like a rejected energy drink logo.”

He’s right. A plate with an elk, joint in mouth, chilling before the Teton’s jagged peaks could’ve been Wyoming’s Mona Lisa. Instead, we got a design that prioritizes tourism over soul. The “That’s WY” slogan and URL are a middle finger to the state’s rugged identity, a reminder that tourism, Wyoming’s No. 2 industry, trumped aesthetics. “They’re selling us out,” Moose says. “Our colors are brown and gold, maybe that old warm blue. This navy-red-white crap feels like it’s from Delaware.”

-----

The Rebellion: Can You Fight the Man?

So, can Moose keep his old plate and tell WYDOT to shove it? Nope. Wyoming law mandates a new plate design every eight years, and the 2025 series is non-negotiable for all vehicles by 2026. Old plates—those gorgeous Green River Lakes scenes—will be recycled, no exceptions. WYDOT’s Motor Vehicle Services (307-777-4709) confirmed it: no opting out, no grandfathering, unless you’ve got an antique vehicle (25+ years old, limited use). Moose’s Sable, despite its vintage charm, doesn’t qualify.

But Moose’s not giving up. He’s got options, and he’s ready to fight. First, he’s eyeing a University of Wyoming (UW) specialty plate. It’s still on the 2025 base design, but the brown-and-gold UW logo softens the blow. At **$180** extra ($150 for scholarships, $30 to WYDOT), it’s a pricey protest, but Moose’s considering it. “At least it’s got our colors,” he says. “And I can keep my old UW number if I’ve got one.” He’s also mulling a personalized plate—four letters to say “FCKPL8” or “NOPE.” That’s another **$30** fee, but it’s a middle finger to the standard design.

Moose’s real plan, though, is to raise hell. He’s drafting a Change.org petition, demanding WYDOT rethink the design or at least allow scenic opt-outs. He’s posting on Reddit and X, where the plate’s already a punching bag (137 votes, 169 comments on one r/wyoming thread). He’s got a vision: side-by-side photos of his Sable with the old plate (pure Wyoming) versus the new one (pure sketch). “I want this to go viral,” he says. “People need to see how bad WYDOT fucked us.” He’s even eyeing local media—Cowboy State Daily, K2 Radio—to amplify the cause.

For now, Moose’s coping with a license plate frame to cover the “That’s WY” slogan and URL. “I’m not advertising their bullshit,” he says. But he’s careful—the frame can’t obscure the plate number or county prefix (1P for Natrona), or he’s risking a ticket. Long-term, he’s dreaming of 2033, when the next plate cycle hits. “I’m starting the fight now,” he says. “Elk with a spliff in front of the Grand Teton, or a bucking horse in brown and gold. No URLs, no slogans. Just Wyoming.”

-----

The Bigger Picture: Why Plates Matter

This isn’t just about a bad design—it’s about identity. A license plate is a state’s face, a daily reminder of who you are. Wyoming’s old plates were a love letter to the land, blending with the sagebrush and the Bighorns like they were forged in the same fire. The new plate? It’s a corporate handjob, a tourism pitch that alienates the people who actually live here. Moose’s Sable, once a proud piece of the Cowboy State, now feels like an outsider in its own home.

“It’s deeper than aesthetics,” Moose says, leaning back in the diner booth. “This plate changes how I move through the world. It’s dictating my sunglasses, my mood in traffic. It’s like WYDOT’s telling me Wyoming’s not mine anymore.” He’s right—stupidity and bad design can erode a society, one garish plate at a time. The “P” and “T” prefixes, the thick outlines, the ass-sniffing Steamboat—it’s death by a thousand cuts.

So here’s to Moose, the rebel with a cause, shielding his eyes from WYDOT’s disaster while plotting a comeback. He’s got his petition, his Reddit posts, and a dream of an elk-with-a-spliff plate that’ll make Montana jealous. Until then, he’s rolling down CY Avenue with a hand up to block the glare, a cowboy in a state that forgot its colors. “Brown and gold, homie,” he says, tossing a tip on the table. “That’s Wyoming. Not this ‘That’s WY’ bullshit.”",1,1747831148.0,LICENSEPLATES,0,1.0,False

**Chapter 31. Hunt for a home**

  
**Three days later.**

Earthquakes pretty much became a thing by the time we returned from Pallport. The first one came when we were at Volcano Lane. But the other one struck almost the moment we boarded off at Orowen.

The next one came the next morning. Then the morning after that. And also today. After the whirlwind week that was behind us, we weren't really affected by a little shaky ground. So Lily, Asmod, Smokewell and I had simply walked out of the Nook and waited under the open sky for the tremors to stop.

They stopped after about five minutes.

The cat stretched her back and gave a yawn. “I'm going to go and resume my nap.” She started back towards the store.

I didn't let her get too far and lifted her off the ground. “Forget it. You are coming with us.”

The feline looked puzzled. “Coming where?”

“To find an apartment!” Lily hopped up and down excitedly.

Smokewell didn't share the enthusiasm. “You are the ones who are supposed to go and find the house. I'll come when we will be ready to move in.”

“Fine.” I shrugged. “Then we'll make you pay the rent.”

“Cats don't have to pay rent,” Smokewell said.

“Okay. Then we'll just take your share of the reward that Hammer gave us,” I said. “Lily?”

“Already did.” The girl waved a pouch full of steambolts. The coins chimed inside the fabric.

“I'll snatch your soul!” Smokewell snapped.

“That's enough whining for the morning.” I held the cat under my arm like she was a bundle of blankets. “It's time to get moving now.”

We waved our goodbyes to Asmod before we left to hunt for a home.

\_\_

Lily and I had circled some advertisements for apartments to rent in the newspapers. We weren't looking for anything fancy. But now that we had some real money in our hands, we also wanted something more than a place to squat.

According to old Elsa's memories, the places we lived in weren't really something we could've called a home. They were places to sleep. Places to hide from the Inquisition. Places to lie low in. Places to operate from. But no homes.

I wasn't sure if this place we were headed towards was going to be any different. But it was certainly going to be more than what we'd had until now.

Our first stop was a tenement in Hobvale Avenue. It looked like a respectable neighborhood with a coffee shop a few paces down the road and a tram stop that was a few paces from the coffee shop. The building was owned by some kind of real estate tycoon of this time and world.

That meant the price was going to be higher than usual but we also had an agent to give us a little tour. He was a guy named Louis Porter who looked like a candidate for a science experiment that had gone wrong. Big, bulging bloodshot eyes that watched our every movement with almost terrifying attentiveness, a nose that was slender as a breadstick and a pair of rodent buck teeth sticking out from under a pale upper lip. He had a non-existent chin and a neck long enough to make an ostrich proud. And when he spoke, the words were breathy and thin.

""I'm Mr. Porter and you must be the ones that put in the request for a tour?"" he said, shaking our hands. He was dressed in a business suit that mostly hung limp on his scrawny frame. And a smoky glass ball was hanging by a chain around his neck like a pendant.

""Yes. I'm Elsa Grimly. I sent the telegram,"" I said, not letting his handshake linger.

""A pleasure to meet you all,"" he said. ""You ladies can rest assured that this is the safest neighborhood in Orowen."" He swept his arm across the street. ""It's all thanks to the Steam Elemental and the work of our diligent Internal Police.""

I could hear a muffled sound from Lily, which was probably a groan. And Smokewell gave a soft hiss on my shoulder.

Porter's big eyes bulged even further at the sight of the black cat. ""Is that your house pet?"" he said, a little uncertain.

""She is a part of our family, yes."" Lily said defensively.

""Oh, I see.""

""Are pets not allowed in this building?"" I said.

""No, no, that's not the case."" He shook his head. ""It's just...black cats are an odd choice for a pet since--""

""No, we don't care. Can we just begin the tour?"" Lily said.

""Certainly, certainly."" Porter nodded nervously, his hand going to the glass ball on his chain.

He led us inside the building and up the flight of stairs to the third floor. His sales pitch involved listing the nearby grocery stores and restaurants and how only all the respectable people frequented these places. ""Also, lets not forget the Holy House of the Steam Elemental that is just two streets down the road. A person needs to be in touch with the divine to be truly happy.""

""Another Steam Elemental house?"" I said. ""Isn't there one on Eternity Square too?""

Porter nodded. ""There are four such Holy Houses in Orowen. And for good reason, afterall--""

""No, we still don't care,"" Lily said as she pushed the apartment door open and walked inside. I followed. Porter hurried after us.

""As you can see, the sitting room is spacious,"" Porter waved his scrawny arms again to show how big the room was. ""You can have a couch here, a few more chairs and a coffee table to host more than a few guests.""

""We don't get many guests,"" Lily said.

""Also, look here."" Porter moved to the corner of the room. ""You can put a piano here to liven up the evening or even put your cat's bed for her to lounge in.""

""None of us plays piano,"" I said.

Porter took us to the kitchen next. ""The counter is big enough for two people to cook together, there's also that small nook in the wall that can be a mini-pantry. You get drinkable water throughout the day. Also, look at all these cabinets for your fancy crockery and cutlery.""

""We don't have either of those,"" Lily said and wandered over to the bedrooms.

""You'll get two bedrooms. Both of them are the same size. Both of them big enough to have a king sized bed, dressing screen over there and a dresser mirror to admire your beautiful faces in."" Porter gave us a smile that had my soul cringing inside me. ""And look here!"" he pointed at the window. ""Isn't the view beautiful?""

""Uh...it's just more buildings."" Lily shrugged.

""No, but look over there, can't you see the steam rising in the sky?"" he pointed at the pyramid of the Holy House in a little distance. ""Now, isn't that just the view to wake up to? Just waking up and feeling so close to a god that actually exists?""

""No, I want to see the bathroom first,"" Lily said and left the bedroom.

""Yes, yes. Let me show you to the bathroom."" he opened the door in the hallway leading to a fairly big bathroom. ""All the fittings are made of brass and look at that gorgeous little bath tub for you beautiful ladies to soak yourselves in."" Porter showed us that he took his job seriously and actually laid down in the tub to show us just how relaxing it was. ""Now, tell me you wouldn't want to be down here with me--I mean, in my place?""

""Heavens no,"" Lily and I said in unison.

Fortunately, he kept the toilet tour a lot more brief and lot less demonstrative than the bathroom tour and led us back to the sitting room. ""And I can guarantee you that you'll be happy and comfortable in a place this big and safe at the rent of just five hundred steambolts a year,"" he said. ""Other than that you get a chance to be a part of the neighborhood associations that host all kinds of gatherings. One of which involves a weekly visit to the Holy House to cleanse the spirit and soul.""

""Isn't there a way to opt out of that thing?"" I asked.

""Of course, you can."" Porter nodded. ""But I won't recommend it. As you see, dark magic is a danger to our humble society. We live in a world where anyone can be bewitched or cursed. It's important to stay in touch with the divine so that we may not lose our way.""

""Um, you do know that there are witchcraft covens that work along with the government?"" Lily said. ""They just had to sign that agreement and they are living with everyone else. Like everyone else.""

""Yes but that doesn't mean that the dark magic is any less dangerous."" Porter's voice was deep with a paranoia that people of faith often had when they spoke of things that their faith deemed dangerous. ""As a man in a business of housing and people, I've seen too many families that have succumbed to the dark magic. Too many homes destroyed by humanity's sinfulness. We need to build a strong community around our faith to battle the forces of the dark.""

Lily and I just watched the real estate agent. ""You know what? Give us a moment so we can discuss if we want to sign up for this place,"" I said.

""Certainly, certainly. I'll wait outside,"" he said and walked out of the apartment.

Smokewell hopped off my shoulder. ""Before you decide to take a vote, let me tell you, no,"" the cat said. ""We aren't buying this place.""

""But it looks so good!"" Lily said.

I raised an eyebrow. ""Weren't you acting uninterested for the entire tour?"" I said.

""That's a purchase tactic, Miss Elsa"" Lily said in a conspiratorial tone. ""I was acting uninterested so he would feel more eager to sell the place to us. That way the ball will be in our court and we could bargain a price we want.""

""That's clever,"" Smokewell said, ""We're still not buying this.""

""Why not?!"" Lily said.

""Because I don't want to be a part of any Steam Elemental masturbatory group,"" Smokewell said.

I lifted the cat off the ground. ""Keep your voice down. And yes, this may be one of those times I actually whole heartedly agree with you. That agent is creepy at best and a cuckoo in the head at worst.""

The cat nodded and turned to Lily again, ""Also, stop calling those agreement covens 'witches'. They aren't. They are dogs on the government's leash. We are the last witches in Ravenwind, remember?""

Lily rolled her eyes. ""I get it! We aren't buying this house. Let's just get going then.""

And so we did.

\_\_

Next stop was an apartment building on Mingate Street. The area wasn't as high profile as the previous one. The apartment building was also a lot smaller--only two-stories tall and all brick and mortar.

The landlady was some old woman who was rumored to be a baroness of some time. She had sold off her dead husband's fortune and come to live in the city to be along with people rather than living on some big estate alone.

Her name was Beatrice Dalley and she looked like something out of a children's fairytale. Silk dress, walking cane, half moon glasses and a cotton bonnet on white hair. ""Would you kids like some cookies?"" she said in a motherly voice, opening a jar full of biscuits when we told her the purpose of our visit.

""Of course!"" Lily snatched a cookie before anyone could stop her.

""Oh, its always a pleasure to host such lively young women,"" Beatrice said, her friendly wrinkled face wrinkling further as she smiled.

I gave a polite smile in return and said, ""You are very kind, Miss Beatrice. If you don't mind, we would like to see the apartment right away.""

The old woman nodded and led us to an apartment down the hallway. She told us that the building used to be her late husband's office that she had renovated to what we saw. ""He was a man who liked to support the community he lived in. I think this is what he might've wanted too.""

""That sounds very nice, Miss Beatrice,"" I said.

Smokewell was rolling her eyes on my shoulder as the old woman kept monologuing.

""We mostly have families living here,"" Beatrice said. ""I love the sound of children playing in the hallways. We also have a playground in the back with a swing and slide for them.""

""That's very sweet, Miss Beatrice,"" I said. Smokewell rolled her eyes again.

Even though the building wasn't that big, the apartment that she showed was bigger than the one we'd seen in Hobvale. It had three bedrooms, two bathrooms and it came pre-furnished. The furniture looked vintage and expensive. I felt a bit uncertain as I looked at the place she was showing. ""Are you sure the rent here is just 300 steambolts a year?"" I said.

""Of course, dear. Why would I lie?"" Beatrice said with her motherly smile.

""But, this place looks quite big--""

""Bah."" She waved a wrinkled hand at me. ""It won't be big enough once you bring the children.""

Lily cocked her head. ""What children?""

""Your children of course,"" she said.

""Um, Neither of us are married, Miss Beatrice,"" I said.

""So?"" the old woman said, ""It's not like you are going to die a spinster, are you?""

""Trust me. I, at least, am not looking to fall in love anytime soon,"" I said.

""That's what I used to say at your age, too, young lady,"" Beatrice said. ""But then I met Mr. Dalley and I wanted nothing more than to be with him.""

""That's nice but--""

""Let me give you some wisdom I've acquired over the years,"" she said. ""Everyone falls in love. Everyone! Especially the ones who are sure they don't need love. In fact, they are the ones that fall the hardest!"" She stamped the ground with her cane as if to emphasise her point.

""Woah, okay. I get it, you don't have to--""

""You should listen to your elders. The best thing that can happen to a girl is marriage. And bearing lots and lots of healthy children.""

""You know what? Maybe we'll come back in the evening and tell you if we want to buy the place or not."" I took a step back, gesturing Lily to follow.

Beatrice followed our movements with her eyes that were set deep in her wrinkled face. ""I hope you do buy this place. You shouldn't waste your beauty like that by dying alone. You can even offer this house to your husband as a dowry. Nothing convinces a man into marriage more than a promise of a stable home."" She started moving towards us.

I frowned. “How can I sell this place? You are the legal owner.”

“You can buy it if you want to settle down here along with your husband and children. You can buy it for just fifteen hundred steambolts.” She took another step forward.

""Okay, we're out."" I grabbed Lily's hand and yanked her after me, out of the apartment and down the hallway.

""You can't keep running forever!"" the old woman called out in a shrill voice. ""Love spares no one! No one!""

\_\_

Lily groaned when we halted a few yards down the road. “Are we going to buy a place or just run around?”

“Really? You were ready to live there?” Smokewell said. “I was older than that goat when I died and even I found her ideas to be ancient.”

“But she was offering separate bathrooms!” Lily said.

“Not worth it, Lily.” I shook my head. “Not worth it.” I heaved a sigh and looked up at the sun, squinting my eyes. It was almost afternoon now. “Let's check one more place and stop somewhere for a coffee.”

We hailed a steam carriage and rode it to Lillcairn street. The building was three stories high and the landlord was a tobacco chewing, monocle wearing, tweed jacketed clerk type guy.

His office was a small room to the right of the entrance door. The wall behind his chair was covered by bookshelves that held up thick leather tomes. On top of his desk was a plaque that read: **Wesley Ainsworth (Owner).**

“So you are looking for a place to live?” He said, his mouth perpetually busy chewing on tobacco as he leaned back in his chair and took in each of our faces. “Can I see some identification?” he asked.

I showed him a provisional ration card I'd gotten myself yesterday. Hopper knew some officer at the city council who knew the ration department guy so the rest of the process was carried out swiftly.

Ainsworth went through the document and gave a brief nod. He didn't seem very pleased. Then his monocled eye turned to Lily. “What about her?” he asked.

“We didn’t bring her documents,” I said. “We were hoping to get only a tour of the apartment for today.”

“She must have some other kind of identification,” Ainsworth said. “A driving license. A passport. A birth certificate.”

I was about to respond when something gave me a pause. Lily. She was gripping her skirt. Her movement was anxious.

I held back a frown and looked back at the man behind the desk. “We don't have a carriage so naturally we don't have a license either,” I said. “As for the other documents, we didn't feel the need to bring those since we are only looking through the apartments, as I already told you.”

“Perfectly reasonable.” Ainsworth shrugged. And then he leaned ahead, putting his arms on the desk and interlocking his fingers, his eyes intent on Lily. “Maybe you should just tell me your name.”

“Lilian,” she said.

“Miss Lilian, can I know your last name?”

“Stark,” she said in a heartbeat.

Ainsworth raised an eyebrow. “Lilian Stark? That's a nice name.” He leaned back in his chair. His eyes were even colder now. “Are you from around here?”

“No,” Lily said.

“Where are you from?”

“Ironfort,” Lily said.

Ainsworth nodded. “What does your father do?”

“He passed away in an accident.”

“What did he do when he was–” Ainsworth paused, scrunching up his nose. “What is that smell?”

After he mentioned, I noticed it too. A really pungent odor had invaded the crampy office. Then I realized. Smokewell was not on my lap anymore.

“This damn cat!” Ainsworth shrieked. “She pissed on my shoe!”

A black shadow leapt up from behind the desk and hopped on top of it. The man looked ready to smack her with one of the thick tomes on the shelf behind him. But he was no match to the cat's agility.

The feline launched herself at him and swiped her paws against his face before jumping out of the window above the shelf. Lily, who had been squirming and nervous in her chair a few moments ago, was now smiling.

She rose up. “On the second thought, Mr. Ainsworth, we don't want to get a house here. We'll get going.”

She started on her way out. I followed her.

Smokwell was on the sidewalk, licking her paw. She looked at us and rolled her eyes. “Finally, you decided to get out of there,” she said. “If I was that patient with nosy pricks like that when I was a human, then I'm glad I killed myself.”

Lily giggled. “You know, you are the best teacher I had, madam?”

“I know.”

Lily's giggles turned to laughter. Then she yawned. “I'm tired. Let's get some coffee, girls.” She started walking.

Smokewell and I watched her as she moved down the sidewalk. “What even happened in there?” I asked.

“Don't act like you don't know,” the cat said, hopping onto my shoulder.

This time I actually didn't. Old Elsa's memories didn't help me remember anything about Lily that might explain why Ainsworth's questions had made her so nervous. Or why seeing the man in agony had pleased her so much. As I focused on memories of her, I remembered that Lily's last name wasn't Stark. In fact, she had never told me what her last name was.

“I won't blame her for it,” Smokewell said. “It's hard for her to live with what happened to her. I wouldn't want to tell anyone about it either if I was her.”

\_\_

The waitress at the coffee shop brought our orders. Compared to my world, the options for beverages were way more sparse. But that was also a good thing. It meant, if you had to order a coffee, a coffee was all you got. And that's what I'd ordered. Lily was having hot chocolate. And we'd asked for a bowl of milk for Smokewell. And the cafe owners were kind enough to oblige.

I was still curious about what had happened at Ainsworth's place. But seeing that Lily was back in her usual cheery attitude, I decided to refrain from prying. I took a sip of coffee and Lily let out a heavy sigh.

She was looking out at the sun. It was close to evening now.

“So, did we just waste our day today?” Lily said.

“Things like these are bound to happen, Lily.” I took a sip of my coffee. “The time and place that we are living in isn't very–”

“You!” someone chirped out of the blue, making me almost choke on my drink.

I turned to look at the person and it was the woman who had been about to jump out of the clock tower when we first met her. Lenora Desmond. “I thought I would never get to see you again!” she cried out in joy.

Everyone at the coffee shop was staring at us now. “Keep it down, woman,” Smokewell said. “We are busy mourning our bad luck.”

Lenora gasped in wonder. “The cat still talks!”

I groaned and pinched Smokewell's ear. “Stop talking in public places, you're grabbing a lot more attention than her,” I warned in a hushed whisper.

Lenora dragged a chair from a nearby table and made herself comfortable alongside us. “You wouldn't believe how happy I am to see you,” she said. “Also, I'm not Lenora Desmond anymore.”

Her smile got smaller but her eyes looked a lot more serene as she told us about her divorce with her husband. “Ever since I became Lenora Griffin again, I just feel…at ease,” she said. “It feels so weird now that I think about what I was putting up with in my marriage. The constant interrogation, the constant suspicion. But, I don't have to live through any of that now.” Then she looked at each of us. “And I have you all to thank for that. For making me realize what I was doing to myself.”

I cleared my throat nervously. What was I supposed to say to that now? “You're welcome.” I nodded.

Lenora nodded back and leaned ahead. “Also, I feel terrible right now because you all didn't even tell me your names the first time we met.”

\_\_

So we told her our names. She brought everyone another round of beverages and also cookies to go with them. Then she asked us about what we were mourning before she barged in on us.

I was still hesitant to speak. But Lily wasn't. So she told her about our adventures since the morning and our bad luck with finding a good house.

Lenora gave it a thought before I saw a flicker of something in her eyes. She looked at us. “You know what? I've been in a similar situation for a while now,” she said. “I do have a place to live right now but well…it's not really a home, if you know what I mean.”

“Oh, we get what you mean. We get it very well.” Lily nodded.

“But there's a solution to our problem,” Lenora said.

“*Our?”* I said.

Lenora grinned. “Let me take you to a place I had my eye on since before my divorce.”

In Rio de Janeiro, they have a characteristic: a strong carioca accent, they live near the beach and vary between cool, exaggerated and surfers. In the northeast, I usually see them as politicians or rich white businessmen. I have no doubt that the latter are descendants of the first colonizers. In general, there are certain cultural differences. As each region has its own accent, not one standard rich accent, but several.

But let’s be honest. You’re probably asking, “Will a degree I earn online actually mean something?” That’s a fair question and one a lot of people are asking these days.

Imagine this. You're sitting in your pyjamas, sipping coffee, and learning about business strategy from someone who’s actually led big companies. Sounds better than rushing through traffic to sit in a classroom, right?

That’s the beauty of an [**MBA degree online**](https://paruluniversity.online/masters-programs/online-mba-program/). It fits your life, not the other way around.

A lot of students and professionals choose this path because:

* They’re working full-time and can’t just quit their job.  
* They want to learn without moving cities or countries.  
* They’ve got other responsibilities like family or freelancing gigs.  

It’s flexible, practical, and still gets you the knowledge and credibility you need.



# What Makes a Program “The Best”?

Not all **online MBA programs** are created equal. Some just throw video lectures at you and call it a day. Others actually care about your journey.

So, what should you look for?

* Courses that reflect real-world business problems (not just theory).  
* Teachers who’ve been in the game, not just in books.  
* Career help like resume support and job connections.  
* A learning platform that doesn’t make you want to pull your hair out.  

The **best online MBA programs** actually feel like a community. You’re not just a number. You’re part of a group of people all pushing to grow.



# Does It Work in the Real World?

Here’s a story: Priya, a marketing exec in Pune, felt stuck. She wanted to climb higher, but her degree from ten years ago just wasn’t cutting it anymore. She signed up for an [**MBA degree online**,](https://paruluniversity.online/blogs/how-online-mba-programs-make-it-possible/) studied during her evenings, and within 18 months, she landed a senior role at a top firm without ever stepping into a classroom.

That’s the kind of change we’re talking about. And she’s not alone. A report by LinkedIn says online degrees are gaining serious ground, especially when they come from known universities.

Employers care more about what you know and how you think than whether you sat in a lecture hall or not.



# So, Is This Right for You?

Ask yourself:

* Do you want to move up in your career without leaving your job?  
* Do you like learning at your own speed?  
* Are you willing to put in the effort even if you’re doing it from your bedroom?  

If you nodded yes, chances are a **best online postgraduate degree** is worth looking into.



Studying online isn’t the easy way out it’s the smart way forward. You’re still grinding, still learning, still growing. You’re just doing it in a way that works for *your* life.

Whether you’re aiming for a promotion, a career switch, or just want to prove something to yourself, an **online MBA** could be your move.

Hear me out: Tax revenue from sales alone for cannabis was 244 million in 2024. While I think it’s a good idea that the funds are already going to schools and other categories deemed necessary, I think it would be smart for a percentage of that be diverted to help those needing to rebuild so they can actually do so. 

I also think it would be smart to raise the taxes on alcohol, tobacco, vape stores, etc by .05% with the permenant designation for natural disasters as well. Maybe even raise cannabis by .05% as well just for this fund. Yes I know taxes are already pretty high on those things, but I think this is the least disruptive way to generate needed income for the state without raising taxes across the board on everyone.

What’s everyone’s thoughts on this? I might be way out of bounds or I might not. Would love to hear opinions that both agree and disagree. ",0,1747830328.0,StLouis,6,0.18,False

1krwhox,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1krwhox/struggling_in_week_6_of_elvanse_titration_looking/,Struggling in Week 6 of Elvanse Titration – Looking for Advice and Shared Experiences," Hi all,

I'm currently in my sixth week of titration with Psychiatry UK. I've already submitted a note through the portal, but I wanted to reach out to the community in case anyone has had similar experiences and can offer insight, advice, or encouragement.

Background:
I started on 30mg Elvanse in Week 1 and felt an immediate improvement on Days 1 and 2—it was genuinely night and day. My anxiety disappeared, I felt emotionally stable and less irritable, and I was able to complete routine tasks without that overwhelming mental resistance. I was more productive at work and finally getting through my to-do list with ease.

However, after those first couple of days, the effects started to wear off earlier in the day. My focus would drop off, though the ""come down"" wasn’t too bad. Still, I was optimistic and looked forward to increasing the dose in Week 2.

Weeks 2–3 (50mg):
At 50mg, the benefits lasted longer. However, I began experiencing some evening anxiety and had a bit more difficulty falling asleep—though I was still managing to get to sleep at a reasonable time.

Nutrition Note:
For context, I’ve always been a terrible eater—typical ADHD stuff. I’d skip breakfast trying to get out the door, then hyperfocus through work and forget to eat lunch or drink water. This often led to late-night binge eating. I’ve been working on this and started forcing myself to eat porridge in the morning, right before taking my medication.

Week 4 (70mg):
This is when things started to go downhill. Anxiety spiked significantly in the evenings, and I began to feel quite low and even depressed.

The titration nurse suggested splitting the dose: 50mg in the morning and 20mg at lunch. Unfortunately, this kept me wide awake until 3–4 a.m., so I messaged the portal and switched back to taking 70mg in the morning.

The first day back on 70mg was awful—I felt completely wired, almost like being on cocaine. I added a protein shake with my porridge, which helped a little, but I still felt overstimulated.

I’ve since gone back to 50mg, which I’ve been on for the last few days. I’m still eating porridge and a protein shake in the morning, but the medication is making me feel terrible. Today, I had to leave work due to cold sweats, light sensitivity, and stomach issues.

I’ve messaged again to say I’m really struggling and asked what they recommend going forward. I feel like I’m at a crossroads: the early positive effects are slipping away, and the side effects are becoming harder to manage.

My gut feeling is that I might be overly sensitive to stimulants and might need to try non-stimulant options or at least an alternative to Elvanse.

Additional info:

I’ve completely cut out caffeine—went from 6 cups of coffee a day to nothing (no tea, cola, etc.).

My water intake is much better.

I’m now consistently eating breakfast and a balanced lunch/dinner.

Unfortunately, I’ve been smoking a lot more cigarettes, which is another downside I’m aware of.

Has anyone experienced something similar? I'd really appreciate hearing how things turned out for you. I'm also open to any general nutrition or lifestyle tips that might help support the medication process.

Thanks so much in advance.

# Terlingua – January 15

The sun was just waking up.  
You thought I was sleeping.  
Wrapped tight in your blanket  
you held your coffee like hope.  
I watched you play with birds.

You crept behind cover like you wouldn’t be seen.  
They kept you a bush away,  
close enough to keep you chasing.  
In that moment I saw you for you,  
before I knew your depths.  
That morning I knew I would love you.

# Salt Flat – February 23

We drove all day,  
but it felt like an instant.  
We talked about everything, nothing,  
subtle glances,  
soft touches.  
We knew we were onto something,  
neither of us had to say it.

When we got to our camp the sky was on fire.  
I know it was performing.  
Mirroring what it saw in us.  
Finally something tangible,  
like we put it there ourselves.  
We hadn’t said it yet but our eyes knew the words.

# Santa Rosa Beach – May 4

Handshakes and smiles.  
Talking about my job.  
Four generations together.  
My first time meeting most of them.  
My time to shine.  
But really,  
seeing your role, your peace, your glow.  
Daughter, sister, mother, rock.  
Watching your smile fill the room.  
Your warmth filled my heart.

The three of us shared a room.  
We made love that night while >!NAME\*!< slept.  
Quiet, but on fire.  
I held you so tight.  
You always fit like you were made for me.  
You surrendered.  
It made you stronger.

# Gila Hot Springs – May 26

Who gets this far away just to run and look at stars with someone they love?  
What do we see here that we don’t see at home?

I see you.  
At peace. Decompressed.  
Curious. Soft.  
Your touches, your words,  
I’m in awe of your poise.  
Are we finding our stride?  
Is this comfort safe?

We share the same love,  
for each other, in life.  
We don’t take it for granted.  
Like air or a date circled on the calendar,  
we don’t have to talk about it,  
but we know it’s there.  
In this moment our time is eternal.

**Cuchara – July 4**

Our first two bedroom cabin.  
Our first family trip.

Taking turns.  
Building trust.

Walkie talkies, shoulder rides, and bears.  
Stomach born laughter.

She was perfect.  
And you were happy.

Our corner of heaven,  
It was all we needed.

# Crestone – October 12

Just meet me in the middle.  
I’m waiting.

I built my house on your cliffs,  
but I don’t fear the waves.  
I’ve felt the softness of your touch.

I would let you tear me apart,  
but I know you won’t,  
I’ve heard the softness of your voice.

Let me tear you apart.  
Trust the strength of my love.

# Jemez Springs – February 14

We ran through the mountains together.  
Not for the first time,  
but I didn’t know it would be our last.

7000’.  
It was snowing, we didn’t hesitate.  
We never did when it came to running.

Later I asked for your hand,  
and told you I’d give you my life  
if you just said yes.

(I thought) the answer came easy.  
Things always did when we didn’t fight it.  
“It shouldn’t be this hard.”

Now I look back at this trip,  
and I can’t remember the details.  
Am I protecting myself or are you already a fading memory?

**Home Depot Parking Lot – May 20**

I was five minutes early.  
You were ten minutes late.

You always said I overthink things,  
but I swear it means something this time.

We both had our notes ready.  
The first ones we’ve written that weren’t about our love.

Yours was polished and folded neatly.  
You always focused on the small details.

I know mine was messy.  
Why does my writing always get worse at the bottom of the page?

It’s hard being the one that’s left behind.  
Am I supposed to feel like a child?

I almost ran back to my car after you gave me the ring.  
Didn’t it fit right? Didn’t you like the way it shined?

You were supposed to wear it forever.  
Now it’s just a memory.

But then... I hit his profile description, and there it was: a bold statement about how he refuses to date anyone who eats pineapple on pizza. 🍍 Like, not even a ""preferably not,"" but a firm ""will not date."" 

Naturally, being the slightly rebellious person I am (and someone who enjoys a good Hawaiian pizza every now and then), I couldn't resist swiping right just to see how fixed he really was on this bromance-disrupting fruit.

Our convo started out pretty smooth, just the usual chatting about our favorite shows, why we were online dating, etc... But then, I playfully asked about his pizza dealbreaker. He responded with a very serious ""it's a matter of principle."" I was like, ""Oh really? What if it's amazing pizza?"" 

Suddenly, it's like I had triggered the Pineapple Protocol or something, because he launched into a full-on roast of my pizza choices, 😂. It was the most passionate debate I've ever had over a topping! 

Eventually, we just laughed it off, and tbh, it was such a hilariously bizarre reason to swipe left on someone, that we actually did end up going out for a coffee (sans pizza topping arguments)!

I haven’t tried stirring or swirling myself yet, but I’ve seen people mention that it can help with more even saturation, especially with really fresh coffees that release a lot of CO2. In theory, that makes sense: if gas is pushing water away from parts of the coffee bed, maybe a quick swirl helps prevent uneven extraction. But I’m curious how noticeable the effect really is in the cup.

For those of you who stir or swirl during bloom:

* What kind of difference do you taste (if any)?
* Do you always do it, or only with certain coffees?
* Have you done side-by-side comparisons?

I’m planning to run a side-by-side soon, but I’m curious what to expect. What should I be looking (or tasting) for if it really makes a difference?",9,1747829680.0,pourover,15,1.0,False

After a full year — 365 days — of using MITOLYN, I’m finally ready to share a long-term, no-fluff review. I know there’s a lot of hype around “mitochondrial health” supplements lately, and like many of you, I’ve tried my share of energy boosters, brain fog fixes, and nootropic stacks that didn’t deliver.

MITOLYN was different. Not instant, not flashy, but real. Over time, it helped me rebuild my energy, mental clarity, and even my emotional stability in a way that stuck.

If you're thinking about trying MITOLYN or just curious whether mitochondrial support actually works, here’s everything I experienced over the past year.

What is MITOLYN?
MITOLYN is a daily supplement designed to support and enhance mitochondrial function — meaning it helps your cells produce more natural energy by optimizing how they generate ATP (the body’s cellular fuel). The goal is to restore energy from the inside out, rather than temporarily stimulate it like caffeine or sugar.

If you’ve dealt with persistent fatigue, brain fog, low motivation, or stress-related burnout, MITOLYN aims to help at the root level: your cell’s ability to function properly.

What’s in MITOLYN?
The formula caught my eye right away. MITOLYN contains clinically backed ingredients with real science behind them:

CoQ10 – Supports ATP production and protects mitochondria from damage.

PQQ – Stimulates the creation of new mitochondria.

Acetyl-L-Carnitine – Helps with mental sharpness, fat metabolism, and energy.

Alpha Lipoic Acid – An antioxidant that improves mitochondrial efficiency.

NAD+ Precursors – For mitochondrial repair and anti-aging benefits.

B-Complex, Magnesium, and Rhodiola Rosea – To support energy metabolism and reduce stress.

The formulation is clean — no caffeine, no fillers, no synthetic junk. Just a thoughtful combination of compounds that help your body generate sustained, healthy energy over time.

My Experience Using MITOLYN for 12 Months
I started MITOLYN while feeling completely drained, both mentally and physically. Burnout was hitting hard, and nothing else seemed to help long-term. Here’s what the last 12 months looked like.

Months 1–2: Subtle Shifts
Energy was still low, but I noticed less morning grogginess after a couple of weeks.

My afternoon crashes started fading — I wasn’t reaching for extra coffee or sugar.

My mental clarity began improving slowly but noticeably.

Months 3–4: Consistency Pays Off
Energy throughout the day was more stable.

Brain fog almost entirely disappeared.

I felt more productive and found it easier to focus for longer periods.

Months 5–6: Mental and Physical Improvements
Workouts felt easier. I started walking more, lifting again, and recovering faster.

My mood improved — I was more emotionally balanced and less reactive to stress.

Sleep became more restful and consistent.

Months 7–9: Peak Benefits
Clear-headed from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed.

More motivated, focused, and creative at work.

I was able to take on more without feeling drained or overwhelmed.

Months 10–12: Long-Term Resilience
I felt more mentally sharp, physically active, and emotionally grounded.

Fewer colds, quicker recovery, and a noticeable improvement in overall health.

My energy levels today feel better than they did in my twenties (I’m 37 now).

What I Liked About MITOLYN
No crashes, no stimulation – The energy feels natural and sustainable.

Better mental clarity – It’s easier to focus, plan, and stay motivated.

Emotional stability – I feel calmer and more in control under pressure.

Great formulation – No garbage ingredients or hype-based marketing.

Long-term effectiveness – It gets better the longer you take it.

What Could Be Improved
The price is on the higher end, but the value has been worth it for me.

It requires consistency — results build over time, not overnight.

Only available online at the moment, which isn’t ideal for everyone.

Final Verdict After 365 Days
MITOLYN delivered what it promised: long-term improvements in energy, mental performance, and mood. It’s not a quick fix, but rather a foundational tool for rebuilding vitality from the inside out.",1,1747829631.0,pppdizziness,0,1.0,False
