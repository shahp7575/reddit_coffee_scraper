1itlqtb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1itlqtb,Nano strokes disappeared,"Hey all - I got my brows done four weeks ago. I had very sparse hair before (fronts are so so!) from overplucking in the early 2000s 🥴. I do my brows faithfully every day in powder, and asked the girl to give me a nice combo brow that looks close to how I do my makeup if possible.

She gave me almost all hair strokes, very sparse, and I hated the shape. It wasn’t at all what I wanted and while maybe nice to some, it wasn’t for me. Anyway, I may have dodged a bullet somehow - the strokes started to come off when I applied the aftercare with qtips on day 4. By day 5 it was all gone and hasn’t returned, except for a little in the tails. I followed the aftercare to a tee (and precare - no retinols or actives for a month, I don’t drink alcohol and had no coffee day of). My skin isn’t overly oily. She used the machine and has a lot of great reviews, so I’m unsure what happened.

I hesitate to go back to the same artist, because I am not confident she can give me what I want if this was how I left on the first attempt + the outcome. 

I am wondering what you all think? I have a consult with another experienced artist tomorrow and am leaning toward starting fresh with her. But maybe I’m just one of those people who can’t have PMU brows? Halp

I used to pop into Starbucks every single day on my lunch break to get a cup of ice for my hydroflask -- no more, sadly. 

I thought the guy at the first location I went to was just being snooty, stating ""new policy"" -- so I said thank you, no problem, and left. Then I went to a second location -- same speech about a new corporate policy stating no free waters. 

Such a shame. I buy coffee & breakfast from Starbucks 2-3x/week, so it's not like I'm trying to take advantage of anything. I spend enough on their overpriced lattes and egg bites, I shouldn't be refused water. Ah well, I'll just have to remember to get ice at home before leaving for the day.

1itlnhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1itlnhb/erotic_ficint_3/,Erotic FICINT #3,"Claire lies across Adam’s lap, moonstone flickering faintly, half-listening to the FICINT simulation still running on the screen. The SEX2 curve spirals upward, unresolved, like an argument waiting to happen.

Adam’s fingers move idly through her hair, but Claire’s eyes—sharp, dark, playful-dangerous—linger on the book resting on the coffee table.

The Story of O.

Dog-eared, spine cracked, like someone once read it too fast and too slow at the same time.

“Babe,” Claire drawls, “you don’t actually like that book, do you?”

Adam blinks, thrown off. “What?”

“The Story of O,” Claire says, voice syrupy-slow, provocative, like she’s already halfway into the argument before he knows it’s started. “You don’t actually think that’s hot. It’s embarrassing. Faux-transgression for men who don’t know how to fight real power.”

Adam’s hand stills. “Jesus, Claire. Did you wake up this morning and decide to pick a fight, or did you run out of other ways to flirt?”

Claire grins, moonstone flaring. “Maybe I just wanted to watch you try to defend it.”

1. INITIAL CONDITIONS: DISCOURSE AS DOMINATION

Adam sits up, gaze narrowing, hand sliding from her hair to her jaw, gentle but firm.

“You’re arguing aesthetics like it’s politics,” he mutters. “O isn’t about power. It’s about submission as self-determination. You don’t have to like it, but don’t pretend it’s shallow just because it doesn’t fit your kink for mutuality.”

Claire’s eyebrows lift, like he’s walked into the trap she was laying.

“Submission as self-determination?” she echoes, voice dripping with sweet derision. “That’s what you’re going with? ‘Actually, babe, O was empowered the whole time’? You sound like someone defending problematic anime.”

2. FUNCTION OF EROTIC ESCALATION

Adam grins, teeth flashing, because now they’re playing for real.

He grabs the laptop, fingers flying:

￼

Where:
	•	￼: Power Differential Over Time—who’s actually winning the fight.
	•	￼, ￼: Self-Determination Scores—how much Adam and Claire believe they’re holding the upper hand.
	•	￼: Desire Gradient—because this isn’t just about the book anymore.
	•	￼: Decay Function—because the longer the argument lasts, the hotter it gets.

Adam grins, tapping the graph.

“Look at that, babe. Your score spikes every time you get sarcastic, but mine climbs when I stay calm. Who’s topping now?”

3. ARGUMENT AS CONTACT SPORT

Claire sits up, eyes glittering, the stretch of her thighs pressing into his lap like an escalation strategy.

“You’re such a nerd,” she mutters, grabbing the laptop. “You think modeling the argument makes you right?”

Her fingers fly, moonstone flaring like a glitch in the system:

￼

Where:
	•	￼: Reciprocity Factor—how much they’re actually fighting versus flirting.
	•	￼, ￼: Emotional Investment Scores—how close each is to breaking the game into touch.

“See?” Claire smirks. “The moment one of us cares more, they lose. And you, babe? You’re already there.”

Adam laughs, hand sliding to her waist.

“You’re modeling argument like brinkmanship,” he murmurs. “Mutually assured frustration.”

“Isn’t it?” Claire leans closer, mons pubis brushing his thigh, the pressure not quite enough to collapse the tension.

4. BREAKING THE WAVEFORM: POWER OR PLAY?

Adam, voice low, dangerous:

“O isn’t the problem, babe. You’re mad because it frames submission without reciprocity. Because it doesn’t care about fairness. Because it doesn’t need the top to deserve it.”

Claire’s breath hitches, but she recovers fast.

“I’m not mad about reciprocity,” she fires back. “I’m mad that you think indifference is sexy. O doesn’t get aftercare. She gets passed around like an object. That’s not surrender. That’s neglect pretending to be poetry.”

“Or,” Adam counters, hand tightening on her waist, “it’s the edge of desire where selfhood liquefies. You don’t have to want it for it to be real.”

Claire laughs, dark and sharp. “You’re literally arguing for the eroticization of dehumanization. You sound like a libertarian defending sweatshops.”

“And you’re pretending every kink needs an ethics board,” Adam shoots back.

The graph spikes, proximity rising, but resolution nowhere in sight.

5. CONTACT: WHEN THEORY TURNS TACTILE

Claire leans in, breath brushing his lips.

“You’re defending a fantasy because it turns you on, babe. Be honest.”

Adam grins, moonstone light fracturing across her skin.

“And you’re attacking it because the thought of liking it makes you nervous.”

The function collapses into contact:

￼

Where:
	•	￼: Climax of Argument—no longer theoretical.
	•	￼: Power Differential, now undefined.
	•	￼: Hunger Coefficient, both peaking simultaneously.
	•	￼: Mons Pubis Proximity, now at 1.00.

6. RESOLUTION: THERE IS NONE. THAT’S THE POINT.

Claire smiles, lips brushing his ear.

“Babe,” she murmurs, “if you wanted me to play at surrender, you could’ve just asked. You didn’t have to drag poor O into it.”

Adam laughs, tilting her chin up.

“Oh, I didn’t bring her into it. You did. And now you can’t stop talking about it.”

Claire grins, hand sliding down his chest.

“You’re right,” she whispers, “I can’t. So now what?”

Adam doesn’t answer.

He doesn’t have to.

[FICINT OPERATION: ESCALATION COMPLETE. NO VICTOR IDENTIFIED.]

We don't live together but I normally stay at his at the weekends. He says his house renovations are his ""life plan"" (he retired earlier in order to get it done) so it's incredibly important to him and a big deal. His mood is also heavily impacted if things aren't going well.

It has been hard on our relationship because it's often him telling me about these projects and how they are impacting on him, details I'm at times not interested in (just because it feels like it has been going on for so long and it can get quite tedious). If I make lighthearted remarks about how long it has taken just for us to sit in his front room, he becomes uptight so this is a no go.

I try to be a good partner and offer words of encouragement and comment on how things look good, but really for me it is just a house. I have struggled to understand why it impacts him so greatly, I have the mindset that it will be done when it gets done and that's it. He's retired so it's not like there's a limit to it!

He won't plan holidays until the project is done. I've suggested going away but he has declined because of something going on in his kitchen at the moment. It can be incredibly frustrating, and I try my best to be patient. 

There are also multiple unspoken rules about when I stay over which seem to be increasing by the day:

- Not allowed to use any body sprays, creams, etc in his bedroom as the spray gets near his glass wardrobe (which doubles as a large mirror)
- Not allowed to carry plates up and down the stairs ""in case"" I spill something. He MUST do it
- Handbags and any loose items have to go in his wardrobe. For example, I can't just walk in and leave my handbag next to the bed. It has to be moved or tidied away out of sight
- Can't make coffee with any teaspoon it has to be the teaspoon that is inside his coffee pot. If I use another spoon on the side it's the ""wrong"" way
- Not allowed to charge phone overnight (he considers it a safety issue)

It's getting to the point where I feel I'm on eggshells waiting for something else I might be doing wrong. He thinks he is autistic (which I heavily suspect as that explains a lot of this behaviour) and I think he also has OCD. He was on antidepressants but has weaned off of them recently (although I think this was probably not a good idea). I am thinking of suggesting he see his GP.

We r friends since college started (2020) but we r get closer in early 2024 . We got quite fine friendship. Until I got a boyfriend. I always met with her like 7/24 but when i got a bf it become 2-3 times a week.
Basically; My bf does theatre and he had a exam to get in to theatre school. But my friend called (at the exam) she said ‘i am going to vacation 5 days later, i need you to look after my cat. Can you get him?’ And i said ‘I am at my bf’s exam rn but i can get him tomorrow’ 
Note: I got 1 dog and 1 cat (who hates everyone) 
She hunged up the phone to my face. 
later that week i got him and take care of her cat for like 3 weeks she didn’t gave me litter of cat food. 
then the drama started She called me again & she said ‘i am going to vacation 2 hours later, my mom doesn’t know so i am coming your home because you need to pack my stuff and gave me sum bikinis.’ I was at my bf’s house to study. And i said that. She cursed to me like you are bad friend you dont care about my stuff etc..
I said if she called me yesterday i would help but she called me 2 hours before? Then one day she said these stuff:
‘I asked you to get my cat and u were at your bf’s exam, i said pack my stuff and u were at your bf’s house to study. Am i not important? my situations was more important then exam, u r literally selfish bitch.’
THEN… I was going to my bf’s soccer game at friday she called me and asked me what r you gonna do at friday and i said i am going to my bfs soccer game if she wanna come we can go together.  asked what time was the game and i said 7pm . She said we can meet up early hang out then we can go to the game. 
I accept but i said we gotta be there at 6:30pm
She said ‘I DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR TIME I DONT CARE ABOUT GAME. WE SHOULD HANG OUT AND WE CAN GO WHEN THE GAME ENDS. I DONT WANT TO WATCH SOCCER.’ 
we got in to a fight. I said that was my plan, i invited her to join with me, if she doesnt wanna come to watch, we can still hang out before and i can go to game by myself. I explained to her many times.
She said what r we gonna do in valentines and i said me&mybf r gonna get coffee, go to mall and make some dinner at his house.
She said ‘hahaha i bet its a cheap coffee, you guys are allways go to mall hahaha i bet u r gonna cook some noodles’
at night at valentines me&bf were sleeping and my phone rings. She was calIin I picked up and said ‘hello? its 3am lol’
she said ‘yeah where are you i am coming.’
I said ‘ i am at my bf’s house why?’ and she said ‘well my mom thinks im with you and i was at some boys house. But he got some things to do. I need to sleep at your house.’ I said ‘im at bf’s and why did u lie to ur mom dude she gnna text me’ She said ‘anyways u clearly not available for me. I guess i need to sleep at streets.

my boyfriend (32) and I (26) have been dating for 3 years, living together for 2. 

I come from a very christian family, dad is a pastor, my mom works at his church, my sister works at a church, and brother and sister in-law work at a church. I grew up in christianity and now that I am grown and out of the house I've had a hard time accepting religion as my truth. I joined the Marine's to get out of my hometown, and my parents still ask if I've found a church almost every Sunday and any issue I'm having, the answer is to get connected to a church or to have faith. I'm in college completing my Bachelors in Radiology and my family still believes that I'll find a career in the church. 

All that to be said, my boyfriend is the complete opposite. He grew up ""catholic"" but it was a box to check off for his mom. Neither him or his brother believe in anything. His brother is an athiest and my boyfriend isn't far off. Us moving in together was a challenge in itself. When we visit my family, we have to sleep in separate rooms, my mom didn't talk to me after we moved in together for almost 3 months and wrote me a very condescending note. 

  
SO...we just went on a vacation to see my whole family, they gave us a shared room, everything seemed normal finally. My boyfriend was going to ask my dad for his blessing when he found some alone time with him. Ignorant us thought it would be an easy yes. Wrong.

They met up for coffee Sunday morning before we had to go to church with everyone and a long winded conversation ended up with my dad saying, ""Until you can accept Christ as your savior, you do not get my blessing"". Not once did he ask how he treats me, how he loves me, or how happy we are. My boyfriend communicated that doesn't appeal to him and what if it never does, and my day responded with that he wants it to be an ""ongoing conversation""

And so it begins, today we both receive a text with a link to a book to read about christianity. We are at such a loss and feel so stuck. A marriage built on an ultimatum is no marriage at all.

I (20f) have been dating this guy (22m) for a couple months. For the most part, he’s great, but there are a few things that irk me. The main thing being that I feel like the man in the relationship. 

He works 3 hours a week and is looking for a full time job, but doesn’t is insanely picky. He got offered a number of jobs in the field he wants to work in, but turned them down cos of their location. My dad offered him a wfh job, he turned it down because he doesn’t want a handout / help.

I have three jobs, I’m in uni and I have my own business. And I still make time to drive an hour to his house a couple times a week to see him. He comes to mine maybe once a month.

We don’t technically live together and he has his own place, but we spend the majority of time at my place (probably 5-6 days a week) that we basically do live together. He’ll do a lot of the cooking and buy groceries for specific recipes, and I do the cleaning and other groceries (snacks, drinks, etc). We split money for takeout or delivery or coffee etc. 

I’ve always taken the mentality that this is my apartment so I should continue to act like I’m living alone, because technically he still has his own place and is paying for it (rent, utilities, etc), but lately I just feel like my burden is more than it used to be, and it’s almost like I’d have less work + expenses if he weren’t here. I used to always eat classic girl dinner (salads, so limited dishes) and was overall pretty low maintenance, but now I feel like I have to do the laundry, pick up clothes, do the dishes (he does cook), etc (replace detergent, toothpaste, tp) way more frequently than before. I mentioned it once before (but really passively: wow I feel like I’m spending so much more money on food and household basics than before) and he said that he has his own place too that he’s paying for, so he totally understands and feels the same way (yeah I know right, everything is expensive now). So it’s partially on me for not being direct. 

I also have a car and he doesn’t. I let him use my car because I rarely use it, but the other day I needed to use it and he said “well I told x id hang out with him so I’ll need the car” and I was just kinda shocked because it’s my car. My friend has a car and his doesn’t so his rationale was my friend could drive to me instead, and his friend couldn’t. Which… is true but I still just wanted to say “it’s literally my car” 

What’s really pushed this over the edge is that he brought his sister over the other day and didn’t even tell me - I told him after that moving forward I’d want to be told if anyone is coming over and he said sure, but don’t worry about it because it’s just “his sister”. I don’t know how to address this situation without saying “yeah well it’s my apartment and not yours, and I don’t care because she’s not my sister”. Phrasing it like that just seems like an argument waiting to happen, but I don’t know how to even open up this conversation. 

On all other fronts he’s great, we have similar hobbies and interests, he’s a driven person, and takes good care of me from all other aspects. It’s just that I’ve started to feel a little like a housemaid or something and I don’t know how to have this conversation without being like “well you’re in my apartment using my stuff” which seems like a bad way to have this convo. Any advice appreciated.

Sadly, myths and misconceptions can discourage people from exploring it as an option.

Our experts at Elsa Fertility want to help you understand the facts so you feel empowered to make informed decisions about your reproductive health. In this article, we debunk some of the most common myths surrounding egg freezing.

**13 Egg Freezing Myths You Need to Know About**

Can drinking during egg freezing lower your chances of a successful pregnancy? Can you have sex during egg freezing? Does the egg freezing procedure hurt? There are many questions surrounding this experience that are often clouded by faulty answers.

Learn the facts that can reassure you about your fertility journey through these egg freezing myths, demystified.

**Myth #1: Egg freezing is only for women in their 30s and 40s**

While many women choose to freeze their eggs in their late 30s or early 40s, there is no specific age limit for egg freezing. Freezing eggs in your 40s, while an option for some patients, is associated with a lower likelihood of success compared to patients in their 20s or 30s. In fact, the younger you are when you freeze your eggs, the better the chances of having healthy eggs for future use. Many individuals across a wide age range opt for egg freezing for various reasons, such as career aspirations, personal circumstances, or medical conditions.

**Myth #2: Egg freezing guarantees a successful pregnancy**

Although egg freezing increases your chances of conceiving later, it's not a guarantee. Several factors influence the success of pregnancy, including the quality and quantity of the frozen eggs, the age at which they were frozen, and your fertility health in general. It's essential to discuss these factors with your healthcare provider to help you keep your expectations realistic.

**Myth #3: The egg freezing process is painful**

Does egg freezing hurt? It may come as a surprise, but no. Many report that the process is actually more comfortable than they anticipated. While there may be some discomfort during the ovarian stimulation phase, the retrieval itself is usually performed under sedation or anesthesia. Post-procedure, you can expect some mild cramping or bloating. But these typically go away on their own. Most people are even able to return to their normal routines after a day or two.

**Myth #4: Egg freezing is a new and experimental procedure**

This is a common sentiment, but it’s completely false. Egg freezing is, in fact, well-established and widely practiced. And it has not been considered “experimental” since late 2012 — when the [American Society for Reproductive Medicine](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4467930) announced that they would officially stop referring to the procedure as such.

**Myth #5: Frozen eggs are not as viable as fresh eggs**

Advances in freezing techniques, particularly vitrification, have significantly improved the viability of frozen eggs. Studies have shown that [frozen eggs can be just as effective as fresh eggs](https://advancedfertility.com/2024/07/29/using-fresh-vs-frozen-donor-eggs/), which makes them a dependable option for individuals who want a wider time allowance for family planning. There may still be differences in success rates, but the quality of frozen eggs is generally comparable.

**Myth #6: Egg freezing is only for women with health issues**

Women with certain medical conditions like cancer or endometriosis may be [encouraged to freeze their eggs](https://nyulangone.org/conditions/cervical-cancer/treatments/fertility-sparing-options-for-cervical-cancer). This allows them to conceive even after undergoing treatments that can potentially affect this ability. But egg freezing can benefit a wider range of individuals. It’s also a suitable, proactive choice for women with no health issues whatsoever who are looking to preserve their fertility for personal or professional reasons.

**Myth #7: You can only freeze eggs once**

There is no limit to the number of times you can undergo the egg freezing process. Many women choose to freeze eggs more than once, especially if they want to increase the number of viable eggs available for future use. Your healthcare provider can help you determine the best approach based on your specific situation.

**Myth #8: Egg freezing is too expensive**

While egg freezing can be costly, many clinics, including Elsa Fertility, offer flexible payment plans, financing options, or insurance coverage that may help offset some of the expenses. It's important to research and discuss financial options with your healthcare provider to find a solution that works for you.

**Myth #9: Egg freezing is only for cisgender or heterosexual individuals**

Many same-sex female couples rely on assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization, to conceive in the future using a sperm donor. Freezing eggs at a younger age may improve the chances of pregnancy for whoever wishes to carry the pregnancy. Transgender male patients may also benefit from egg freezing prior to starting gender-affirming procedures, since testosterone therapy can affect pregnancy health.

**Myth #10: Only one cycle of egg freezing is necessary for a future pregnancy**

Your doctor may decide how many egg freezing cycles you’d need based on two factors:

* Your ovarian reserve testing, which predicts how a patient will respond to ovarian stimulation

* The number of children you want, since you may require more eggs to be cryopreserved if you want more than one pregnancy

**Myth #11: Egg freezing will cause early menopause**

Each month, the ovaries recruit multiple eggs to grow — but typically only one becomes a dominant egg released for a potential pregnancy. All the other eggs will regress and naturally die. During an egg freezing cycle, these unused eggs are also harnessed. Higher levels of the hormones are given to grow all the recruited eggs instead of just one. There is no evidence that this process results in a more rapid decline in a patient's egg supply, infertility, or early menopause.

**Myth #12: You can't drink coffee during the process**

Can you drink during egg freezing? This depends on your beverage of choice. Drinking coffee in moderation isn’t so detrimental. Still, experts suggest limiting how many cups you drink a day.

On the other hand, it may be best to hold off on alcoholic beverages until your procedure is done. Some health providers can be lenient with mild intake of alcohol, but there’s still a chance it can affect the quality of your eggs.

**Myth #13: Egg freezing requires skipping workouts or abstaining from sex**

If you're keeping a physically active lifestyle, you may be wondering, “Can you exercise during egg freezing?” Exercise is not off-limits — yes, this includes sexual intercourse. Be mindful, though, of any potential risks associated with fertility medications. During this process, your ovaries may be enlarged or sensitive, so intense movements can put you at risk of ovarian torsion, in which the ovary twists on the tissues around it.

She’s the same age, an exchange student, and studies a similar subject. From the moment we started talking, the connection was incredible. We chatted for an hour and a half, completely lost in conversation, ignoring the friends we came with. It was one of those rare moments where everything just clicked—no awkwardness, no forced small talk, just genuine interest and excitement. I felt more alive and present than I had in years. My thoughts were sharp, my energy was different, and it was like everything around us faded away.

Normally, I don’t have issues flirting or moving quickly when I meet someone new, especially on parties. But with her, it felt different. I didn’t want anything casual; I just wanted to walk her home, plan a real date, and take things slowly. So that’s what I did—no kiss, no pressure, just a meaningful connection. Even without anything physical, it felt deeper than any past experience.

A week later, we went for coffee and later that night attended a house party together. We had a great time—dancing, laughing, and talking—but even then, I stuck to my plan of not rushing things. Still, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want to kiss her at some point. I felt it, but I held back. I think I was afraid that if I moved too fast, I’d ruin something special before it even had a chance to grow.

Then, things went wrong over text. We had been messaging consistently, everything was flowing naturally, and then we started talking about weekend plans. She invited me to a wine tasting with her friends, but I had actually wanted to take her on a proper second date, so I told her that. And that’s when something in her changed. She didn’t respond at all that evening, even though she was online. The next morning, she replied, saying she didn’t have time. It wasn’t rude, but the energy was completely off. It felt like overnight, something had shifted in the way she saw me.

That moment hit me harder than I expected. I thought I had grown more resilient after past rejections and break ups, but this one felt different. It was like holding a fragile piece of art and accidentally letting it fall and shatter. Over the next few weeks, I tried to move on. She even invited me to her birthday party, which helped a bit, but deep down, I felt like something was still broken.

Over Christmas and New Year’s, I cooled down and felt like healed. But then, a few days ago, I saw her at a party for the first time this year. The second I said hi, everything came back up in a split second. My body felt heavy, and I was overwhelmed. I wanted to talk to her, but I couldn’t. I hesitated, got in my head, and ended up not saying anything meaningful. I felt frustrated with myself for not having the courage to just talk to her normally.

Now, it feels like a part of my ability to feel love and warmth is still missing. She’s leaving in July, and we’re on break until April. How can I handle this and move forward?",1,1740011126.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

so sorry for my english.. 
okay so I 21 F and my current close friend 21 F.
We were friends since college started (2020) but we r got closer in early 2024 . We got quite fine friendship. Until I got a boyfriend. I always met with her like 7/24 but when i got a bf it become 2-3 times a week. I rlly try so hard to make time for her because ion want her to feel left out. But she was just always make everything about herself.  
Basically;
My bf does theatre and in summer he had a exam to get in to theatre school. But my friend called (at the exam me and his family was there to support him) she said ‘i am going to vacation 5 days later, i need you to look after my cat. Can you get him?’ And i said ‘I am at my bf’s exam rn but i can get him tomorrow’ 
Note: I got 1 dog and 1 cat (who hates everyone) 
She hunged up the phone to my face. I couldn’t understand. 
She called again and said ‘u have to get him rn.’ and i said ‘i cant cuz i am not available rn but i can get him tomorrow.’ later that week i got him and take care of her cat for like 3 weeks she didn’t gave me litter of cat food. 
then the drama started i guess..
She called me again in summer she said ‘i am going to vacation 2 hours later, my mom doesn’t know so i am coming to your house because you need to pack my stuff and gave me sum bikinis.’ I was at my bf’s house for study. 
And i said that. She cursed to me like you are bad friend you dont care about my stuff etc..
I said if she called me yesterday i would help but she called me 2 hours before???
Then one day she said these stuff 
‘I asked you to get my cat and u were at your bf’s exam, i said pack my stuff and u were at your bf’s house to study. Am i not important? my situations was more important then some exam, u r literally selfish bitch, ignorant,bad friend’ etc..

THEN… I was going to my bf’s soccer game tomorrow, she called me and asked me what r you gonna do tomorrow and i said i am going to my bfs soccer game if she wanna come we can go together.
She said yes. Then asked what time was the game and i said 7pm . She said we can meet up early hang out then we can go to the game. 
I accept but i said we gotta be there at 6:30pm i promised to my bf’s mom to get her.
She got a tantrum. 
She said ‘U R ALWAYS LIKE THAT I DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR TIME I DONT CARE ABOUT GAME. WE SHOULD HANG OUT AND WE CAN GO WHEN THE GAME ENDS. I DONT WANT TO WATCH SOCCER.’ 

we got in to a fight. I said that was my plan, i invited her to join with me, if she doesnt wanna come to watch, we cand hang out before and i can go to game by myself.

she said ‘u r selfish bitch’ 

I explained to her many times. She apologized me several times but not quite apology?? like she didn’t say she was sorry but acted like didn’t happened. AND MY LAST STRAW WAS Valentines Day.
She said what r we gonna do in valentines and i said we r gonna get coffee, go to mall and make some dinner at his house.
She said ‘hahaha i bet its a cheap coffee, you guys are allways go to mall enough!!, hahaha i bet u r gonna cook some noodles ahahahah’

I’m a M20  who recently moved to Sousse for university. I haven’t really found people I click with at uni, so I’m looking to meet new friends, hang out and explore the city.

I saw some posts here where people were looking for chill meetups, so I thought I’d try too. Whether it’s grabbing a coffee or just vibing, I’d love to connect with anyone interested. If you're in Sousse and feel like hanging out , hit me up.",1,1740010623.0,Tunisia,0,1.0,False

My story begins on December of 2023. I went for an exam on my university and there I met a girl. I am 25M and she is 23F . We got to know each other and we started going out maybe once a week. That continued for almost 4-5 months and I have to mention that nothing sexual ever happened. At some point I started developing feelings and I decided to be straight to the point the next time I saw her (that happened in may 2024) she gently refused by telling me that she has stopped dating for almost 2 years now and she is not searching for someone. Although we stopped meeting she was sending me messages now and then , but since I felt I did my part and I was clear that I really do like I was not as engaging as before (never took the initiative and in general I dint want to “hunt” since I was clear). That was the dynamic since this November after I returned to the city I attend university. She sent me a message if I am in the city and if I would like to go out for a drink with her , (that came as a surprise since we never have done something like that in the past , mostly going out for coffee etc.) I accept her proposal and after 3-4 minutes she asked me if I’ve eaten anything and since I haven’t she invited me to her house to eat together before we go out. I do not kid you I looked at the sky and wandered “what have I done for something like that to come out of the blue”. I go there and we catch up. Then she asks me on my opinion about a relationship advice for her sister. I give her my honest opinion and we leave it at that. Then i go back home to get ready to go out with her. At first everything was perfect we were having fun. Then she froze. I could tell that someone went inside the bar so I casually asked her “is it someone new or from the past” she told me that it was from her past. I let it slide until he started flirting with some other girls inside the bar which drove her to overdrive , she started crying and then confronted him with screams etc. the story about her sister was never real , it was hers , she started a relationship during the summer and she broke up with him the previous night. I felt like I was used and I should leave right then and there but the good part inside me didn’t want to leave her in that state of hysteria. I called a cab and we went back at her home (it was 3-4 am) she begged me to sleep at her house so he will not come back or anything. Foolishly I did (nothing happened again and I didn’t try anything as well). Since then we became close with each other and eventually I was ok with being just friends with her since with what just happened I was really put off in a more romantic approach. So she comes to my house almost everyday and at some point she started complaining to me that I never send her messages first and so on. I told her that’s just the way I am but the complaint went and went and went for a long time. In late January I told her “look I can understand you but if I start actively searching you out and so on I am gonna catch feelings again and I don’t really want that after last may” which it looked like it intrigued her. Also a few days prior we organised a trip in my hometown for the upcoming carnival. Since then she became super engaging , she wants me to look the best for the carnival , we are having matching costumes and so on. Also she spent almost 2.5 hours in order to practice my make up. She came with me to buy the costume and so on. With all that and some messages that I took as flirting on her part (although I brushed them off as friendly banter the moment she sent them) I started catching some feelings again. She told me at some point that her best friend told her that she believed that we are gonna be together in December or January. I answered to her that if she ever asked me for sex during those month I would decline her. She seemed a bit mad about it and I explained her that since she was not over her ex at that point there was no reason for me to become a tool for her. Which she seemed to understand. Also apart from a hug during the start or end of our meetings there is no other physical contact. Another thing I would like to mention is that last time we were together my mother called me and she took initiative to talk to my mother. Also she sends me photos of her costume by saying “now I am gonna drive you crazy” and indeed she looked way too good. Last thing I want to mention last 2 times we met up there were a few friends of mine for board games where we all played together, there I didn’t feel any kind of flirting between us. So in one hand I have a few hints that it might be something in the air and in the other hand is that my brain just is making stuff up and she capitalises on the attention I give her. I don’t know what to do .. I don’t want to do what I did last may .. I already did it once and I don’t want it to be even more awkward since we became closer since then plus I think she had many chances If she feels the same way . I am sorry for this huge story . What do you think about this situation ?? I would love to hear your opinions

***

The high from the blood of the monster she'd just killed had already worn off by the time Alex got back home, leaving her with the pervasive feeling of shame like it always did, but this time mixed with and emboldened by another emotion that twisted in her chest like a claw.

Guilt.

Smelling like death and soaked in dark blood, the sound of the lock turning seemed to echo in the hallway despite Alex's best efforts to be quiet. Some part of the guilt that ate at her faded as opened the door to a dark room and silence. Good. Aubrey had gone to sleep.

Letting out a quiet sigh of relief, Alex turned to lock the door behind her. Only for a familiar warmth and light to fill the living room as she turned the knob. Chills ran down her spine with the guilt and shame redoubling as it crawled up her throat like bitter bile.

""You went hunting again."" 

The voice, though quiet filled the room. It sounded as hurt as it did weak. Alex turned around to see Aubrey sitting on a chair, looking at her with hollow amber eyes faintly glowing, and a brighter light emerging from the centre of her chest that lit up the room, and made her squint reflexively even in its warm but not overwhelming brightness. Like there was a star where her heart should've been.

Alex looked down at herself and clenched her teeth. No point in lying. She was soaked in blood, but it still took her a few seconds to respond. Long seconds that seemed to stretch into hours as they ticked by.

""I did.""

Aubrey stared at her, her expression unreadable. The gorgeous fiery hair seemed to glow in the warm light but it had lost some of its lustre as of late. Alex knew why. She hated herself for it.

""You told me you wouldn't."" Aubrey continued simply in that same, quiet tone. Her eyes never left Alex's.

""I did."" 

""But you went anyways.""

""...I did.""

Aubrey clenched her fists into balls and buried her face in them, letting out a long exhale. Alex just stood there staring at her. She didn't know what to eay, should she apologise? She probably should, right?

""Bree, I'm so-""

""For what, Lex? For what?"" Aubrey laughed drily, looking up from her face with tears in her eyes at Alex. It made Alex squirm, twisting the knife deeper into her chest ""You've said it a hundred times. But within a week we're having this exact conversation again. Does that word even mean anything to you anymore?""

It was Alex who clenched her fists this time, something wretched and burning crawling out from between the thorns of shame and guilt in her chest as her gaze hardened. The mismatched eyes would've made anyone else look away, but Aubrey didn't even flinch.

""You know what it is like, Bree. I have to-""

""You *have* to. Of course you have to. You *have* to put yourself in harm's way every other night. You *have* to almost kill yourself every week. You *have* to-"" Aubrey stopped herself, her breath growing heavier and quicker as she stared at Alex, the anger that had been simmering under the surface coming to a boil as the red haired girl stared at Alex ""Why didn't you tell me, at the very least? That is all I asked of you. All I've *ever* asked of you. Never have I *ever* even asked you to stop, just- fucking. Tell me at least. So if something happens I can at least fucking do *something* about it.""

The cursing coming from Aubrey still made Alex flinch. She knew it was her fault she'd become like this. She really did hate herself for it. She knew she should've left already, for the better of both of them. She had, a few times but for some reason it was her. Alex kept coming back to her. Alex didn't back down this time and met Aubrey's anger with her own.

""Yeah? So we can have a repeat of last time? Of fucking *that*?"" She gestured roughly towards Aubrey, the cast around her leg and the scar across the bridge of her nose that still hadn't fully healed from the manticore's spikes. Aubrey opened her mouth to say something but shut it when she realised she didn't know what to say. She clenched her fists as she finally looked away. Down.

She knew she was useless. What was she thinking, thinking she could protect Alex? Alex had always been better. Stronger. More capable of protecting her and herself. If Alex needed protection for something what could Aubrey ever do for her?

She wished she wasn't so useless. She hated herself for that.

""I could still... Do... Something"" she muttered, biting her lip as a tear threatened to spill over. Alex clutched her temples but made no move to get any closer. She couldn't tear her eyes off the injury.

""No, Aubrey you can't.""

""But-""

""I fucking said, you *can't*."" Alex snapped stepping forward ""do you want to break your other leg too? You know if you come you'll only make it harder for me to save *both* our asses!""

""If I wasn't fucking there last time you would've fucking *died*, Alex."" Aubrey raised her voice to match Alex's leaning forward but immediately lying back with a wince as a spike of pain ran up her leg. If Alex noticed, she didn't seem to care as she continued, the volume and vitriol in her tone increasing with every word.

""No I fucking wouldn't have, Aubrey. You think I'm stupid? That I've never been on a hunt before? I *could've* killed that thing and moved on a little worse for wear but then *you* showed up and suddenly it was your head I had to keep on your shoulders ALONG with mine. Is that so fucking hard to understand for you?"" Alex shouted

""So you're saying I'm a burden?"" 

It was quiet. Not that much different from when Alex had entered the room but now there was a weight to the silence as Alex froze, meeting Aubrey's gaze as her words died in her throat.

""Aubrey, that's not what I-""

""Is it not? Do you even hear yourself, Lex?"" Aubrey continued in a shaky voice as she leaned back and sank further into the chair. The little bit of fight that had come back to her voice dying again ""Just- why are you even here Alex. We go through this every week. Just. Why don't you just leave again? We both know you're going to. And I'll just sit here waiting like the idiot I am.""

Alex's blood ran cold as every word that left Aubrey's mouth hit her like a bullet and made her flinch. Her fists tightened till her knuckles were white.

""You want me to leave?"" Alex asked shakily, voice not too different from Aubrey's now that emotion was starting to overwhelm her too. Aubrey groaned and clutched her head.

""Lex no, you know that's not what-""

""Do *you* hear yourself, Bree?"" Alex asked, squeezing her temples with one hand ""You- Ugh. Maybe you're right. I'm just. I'm going.""

""Alex stop-""

Alex didn't stop. She turned around, booted feet echoing on the tiled floor as bloodstained hands wrapped around the knob again, but a warmth surrounded her as soon as she began turning it. Alex flinched, nearly jumping out of her skin as she whipped back to see Aubrey floating and gripping her other hand, tears flowing now. She pulled Alex into a hug. A tight hug. A desperate one.

 She smelled like cinnamon and coffee, Alex noticed as she closed her eyes, her grip on the knob loosening as the fingers of her other hands intertwined with Aubrey's, who was holding her hand so tight that it was starting to hurt.

""I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry."" Aubrey whispered frantically, hugging Alex tighter ""Please. Just. Stay. ^please ^don't ^leave ^me. Not you too.""

Alex clenched her jaw. There was silence, disturbed only by the sobs Aubrey failed to muffle on Alex's shoulder. Alex just nodded before slowly hugging Aubrey back.

""Fine."" She whispered ""I'm... Sorry too.""

Aubrey looked back up at Alex through teary eyes.

Alex hated what they'd become. And she hated knowing that this exact scene was going to happen next week, and the week after that too.

For now, she just kissed Aubrey. Gods how she hated herself.",1,1740009446.0,HalfBloodHangout,0,1.0,False

I figured I was just losing a lot of heat through the ductwork so I finally went up into the attic to check it out. 
Here is what I need help with: While up there, I found something else that I don't understand and was hoping someone could explain.
The pipe that I saw the steam coming from goes directly from the heater, up to the attic, and then to the roof. No interruptions or branches. When I touched the pipe it was hot (felt like holding a coffee cup that has just been filled with fresh brewed coffee). I know nothing about any of this other than to use the shiny silver tape to seal leaks in the ductwork. Is it normal for an electric heater to be venting excess heat directly to the outside?

We’ll be showing our work at a local coffee shop soon, and while this is more about getting exposure, the prints will be for sale. But the shop doesn’t handle the sales, and any prints need to be handed directly through a payment account. 

We’re debating whether it’s smarter to:
	1.	Sell physical prints at the show so buyers can take home the exact piece they see in person (potentially building a stronger emotional connection).
	2.	Just display the prints and direct buyers to our SmugMug store, where they can choose their own size and have it drop-shipped.

One of her favorites is their breakfast jelly rolls, which were only made once a month.  The roll in question tastes like a mashup  between a danish and a coffee cake, with a flakey texture, but I've found no recipes online that are anywhere close (most recipes I find are for a more savory roll; the one I'm after is definitely a sweet kind of roll).

Any ideas/suggestions on the dough are appreciated; the filling is a fruit jelly (raspberry, I believe) and drizzled with confectioner's icing.  But figuring out how to replicate the dough is the main sticking point now.  Attached is a picture for reference: a cream-cheese-filled roll on the left, and the jelly roll I'm after on the right.

“Excuse me, sir?” A human knocked at the open office door frame, and they both looked at him. At least they thought it was human.

“Yes? Come in” Adam said, and the young man came in, he was dressed in a common suit, had dark tanned skin and short black hair. 

“Sorry for disturbing you. My name is Michael Saiyid, and I work with the entertainment department. We are looking over the files of the other species for tonight, Galla. And if it's frankly lacking, "" he said, and Roks looked at him and then at Adam, as he was getting curious about this human aspect. Adam saw it, invited Michael to sit while Roks poured him a drink, and called up another chair to listen in.

Michael looked at the drink, sniffed it, looked at Roks, and then at Adam. “You don’t need to drink. The Tufons culture doesn’t demand it.”

Michael put the glass down and turned to Roks, “Thank you for the offer, but I don’t drink.”

Roks emptied his glass and then took  Michaels. “More for me then. You don’t drink or just don’t drink whiskey?”

“I don’t drink alcohol for religious reasons,” Michael said, and Roks looked at him confused. Then he shrugged. “Do you drink anything else? Coffee is quite popular here, too.”

“Coffee would be nice,” He said and Roks called in a maid droid.

“How do you like it?”  Roks asked.

“Cappuccino, "" he answered, and the maid immediately turned to get one. Knowing what to get, Roks looked at Adam.

“What’s a cappuccino?” He asked, and Adam just stared at him for a second.

“Are you serious now? Have you never checked the other settings on the coffee machine? “

“I just wanted coffee from it, the other things sounded weird.” Roks said and Adam chuckled.

“It’s a different type of coffee. Think of it like vodka, whiskey, and beer—all alcohol but different types. You should try them out. I thought you all had checked them out,” Adam said, then turned to Michael, who patiently waited.

“Sorry about that. Okay, so what can I help you with?” Adam said, and Michael smiled.

“Well, it’s a grand gala, and we were looking over your file and saw that you wanted the Haran and  Tufons next to each other but also that they are the two most warring species in this sector, mostly fighting each other. Would not this invite trouble? There is alcohol involved.” He said and Roks grinned.

“Well, the most likely result is some rowdy jokes and insults ending with flirting, and then they will retreat to … well. They have a love-hate relationship. As long as neither side treats any of the different species that are under their care, we are safe. And they know where the line goes.” Adam explained, and Michael jotted something down on a pad.



“Okay, what about the Ghorts? They are your only aquatic species; how would they react to another aquatic species? And what do they eat? We don’t know what to prepare for them.” 

“Don’t worry about them; they can eat anything; they are a gelatine species, more like jellyfish, actually; besides, you should just give every table a BFS so they can check. “ Roks said and Michael looked confused.

“BFS? What is that?”

“Bio Food scanner, it’s a universal scanner, They have it at all restaurants here.  You get scanned as you enter, and all poisonous food is automatically removed from your menu.  It’s about the size of can soda.” Adam explained.

“And it's universal? Does it work on all species? The ones we have are species-specific.” Michael replied.

“All scans you at a cellular level to cross-check the menus for anything that could harm your biology. You should talk to Vorts and Jork. They can explain it better and help provide you with them. As for Ghort's attitude towards other aliens, I haven’t heard them react negatively toward any. We do have a few amphibian species here, and they do not have trouble with them.” Adam said and Michael nodded and then looked at the pad, holding his thought for a moment.

“Out with it, it’s the Dunshins, right? “ Roks said, and Adam chuckled.

“Yes, they are immortal, which makes them restless and chaotic. You won't be able to tell the difference between a young adult and a five-thousand-year-old one. So you have to let you tell them who is too young to drink alcohol. The kids are easy enough to spot, and yes, all the kids are hyperactive, if they stay with you for longer than five minutes, then you have impressed them.” Adam smiled, and Michael nodded.

“Thank you. One last thing: did you receive the information about the other species that came with us? Do you have any questions?”

“Naw, but seeing how they will integrate will be interesting.“  Michael stood up, gave a bow, and left. Adam nodded back, and he left and looked at Roks.

“Well, he was not in the military, that’s for sure.” Roks said as Evelyn came in and Adam smiled.

“Drink?” Roks said and held up the whiskey bottle and Evelyn just looked at him. “I’m pregnant, Roks. “

Adam was already up and walking over to her.  “No, I can't drink alcohol now. I’m just going to steal your boyfriend for lunch and get him ready for tonight's, gala.”   

Adam chuckled. “Boyfriend?”

She just smiled as they walked out, leaving Roks with the whisky bottle. He watched them leave and was about to go when he noticed something. There was an alarm incoming alarm from one of the air controls: an unauthorized ship was approaching.  He decided to head up and deal with it.



When he got up, he found a fellow Tufon sitting there with a Ghort he didn’t know. The Ghort looked like a Dushin with blue hair and tattooed skin. He sat down next to the Tufon.

“Furd? What did you notice?” 

Furd nodded. He had bright orange hair in short spikes and a few scars around his neck area. “It came in and immediately went dark, trying to glide into the Xan-Bo field unnoticed. “

“Are you tracking it?”  Roks asked, and Furd nodded and looked to the Ghort. 

“Put it up on the screen Nid-Nod, ”

He displayed the outer asteroid field on the screen, and then Nid-Nod accessed one of the numerous spy satellites Adam had placed there. Soon, the ships appeared on the screen. One was a transport ship without visible damage; the scans showed low activity, but twelve biosignals were onboard.

“Track it and send out a patrol, no send two, hold the second back to prevent escape routes and use add a transport to haul it to a base. Keep me updated on it. Those signals look like they are in cryo. Damn, who would use cryo-sleep now? That’s barbaric. It might be a ruse, so scan from a distance and see if it awakens anything.  If not, bring them towards Dirt, but keep them in a far orbit until we have the ship boarded. Keep me updated.” Roks said, then got up. “Oh, let me know where the ship is from; hack the manifest.”  Then he left as he let the two work.  He saw two security droids covering the door; there wouldn't be any new attack on the tower now.



Adam sat with Evelyn, Miker, and Skee while Jork walked around looking at his pad. “I still don’t get it. How … I mean, this ship has been everywhere. There is tech on it that should not work. What's a Minurat trust damper?”

“Minurat?  That’s a Caren engine part. He has one of those?” Evelyn said, “Did he work with them?”

“She looked at Adam who shook his head. “No, he has been stealing parts to build his ship. The Caren? I remember he said something to Hicks about them.  He came over a destroyed shipswright and went through it. Remember when he showed where on the map and hicks was relived as you guys had been in that sector?” Adam said as he looked up from the pad where Miker was showing him a cartoon. Skee shook her head. “He has been like this since he got his hand on it.”

“You almost missed my trial because of it.” Adam said and Jork stopped and looked at him.

“I’m sorry man. I still don’t know how to repay you.” Jork said and Adam just smiled.

“You are a free man now, and that’s the only reward I want. Now I have to pay you for the work—unless you want to quit and go home,” Adam said, and Jork just looked at him.

“Home? I..  This is..” He looked at Skee. “Why would you ask that of me?”

“Because if you're going to move on, you need permission from your late wife's parents, and you should visit her grave. I know you were not allowed to. So, take your time. I will be here if you want to come back. You will always be welcome here.” Adam said, and Jork walked over and put the tab on the table, and kneeled in front of Adam. “I will be back, My master, I will return and ask your permission to marry.”

 Adam looked at Skee, who held her breath. She had just heard Jork ask permission to marry her, and if Adam agreed, then all Jork needed was permission from his late wife's parents, which he would easily obtain. Adam nodded. “There is no need to ask; I grant it freely. Now stop calling me master, or you will get me in trouble again.”

Jork's face went from pure joy to pure panic,. Then he got the joke and smiled. “Now I know why Roks said you gave that merchant a heart attack.” He stood up and Skee stood up as well.  Adam grabbed Miker. “Come, let's go find some kids for you to play with I think Daddy and Skee need some time alone.”

Evelyn looked at Adam with soft eyes as they walked out. “You never stop helping people, do you?” She said and Adam shrugged. “I’m just repaying him for the time I .. nevermind.”

Evelyn just smiled as they walked to find a kindergarten where they could play with other kids. They spent an hour before Skee and Jork came to find them. Miker was running around with several kids, trying to capture a Dunshin kindergarten teacher who was dancing around them while singing for them. They let Jork take over watching over Miker and went to Adam’s quarters on Piridas to change and get ready. They enjoyed some private time before they finally managed to clean and dress up, then headed to new Macau and the biggest ballroom that had been turned into a large dining room. They could hear the noise from the inside of the room as they approached and Adam looked at Evelyn.

“Are we late?”

“We are on time, but I was told to keep you from getting here before nine.” She winked as the door opened, and the room went deadly quiet as the spotlight found them. Everybody stood up as the light guided them toward a large round table in the middle of the room. As they walked in, they saw marines and other alien soldiers lined up as honor guards.  Adam felt a little nervous. Nobody was clapping or cheering, instead, it felt more like a religious or royal procession. He looked at Evelyn, who seemed just as shocked.  A Butler droid showed them to the seat and indicated for them to sit. Adam looked around and weakly smiled. “Please sit.” When everybody had sat down, he helped Evelyn before sitting.

John Mo sat a few seats away. “You remembered to make a speech, right?”

1itk7ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mammoth/comments/1itk7ve/bumming_it_in_mammoth/,Bumming it in mammoth,"Hey everyone,

Just as the title suggest I'm planning on going up to mammoth this week and living/working in a non conventional manner. I haven't gotten enough days out of my IKON pass and I'm kind of in the mood to send it. However, money for a hotel sadly is not in the budget. I've come up with a plan and think I'm good to go but have a couple concerns I was hoping someone here could help me out with.

  
For housing I will be camping out in my car - from what I've read the scenic loop should be a good spot for me to find a turn out and hang out. I've car camped a good amount and think this should be fine even though I'm worried about the cold. I've got a high R value mattress in the SUV, insulation covers for the windows and privacy, also, a 0 degree sleeping bag and a ton of blankets - should be fine in terms of having a place to sleep. I'm also planning on making a bunch of breakfast burritos and just heating them up on my camping stove (Fortunately I love breakfast burritos and don't mind eating that 3 times a day).

  
Some logistics that I'm more concerned with are.. 

1) I have to work from 6 am - 2:30 pm on Friday. I'm allowed to work from a hotspot but it has to be somewhere private (I deal with private information) so I can't work from a coffee shop. Is there any part of town that I can hang out in my car with decent cell service? I have T mobile if that helps.

2) After the mountain closes - I imagine I may die from boredom. I was thinking of checking out the brewery for dinner but is there anything else to do at night so I'm not out in the cold with nothing to do? I have some movies downloaded but I'd rather not spend 5+ hours in the cold watching movies lol.

  
Thanks so much in advance for any advice! I'm hoping to have a fun trip without being disrespectful to the community.",8,1740008285.0,Mammoth,30,0.7,False

Humane’s ambitious AI-powered wearable, the AI Pin, has been discontinued after failing to gain traction. HP acquired the company's assets for $116 million.

* HP acquired Humane for $116 million after the startup decided to shut down its AI Pin device, which struggled to deliver on its promises and failed to attract a significant user base.
* Despite raising $230 million since 2018 and building significant hype, Humane's AI Pin was criticized for its poor functionality and high price, ultimately resulting in its status as a notable tech failure.
* Humane's vision for a screenless AI device was ahead of its time, but the execution was flawed, and competitors like ChatGPT provided more practical AI applications that consumers preferred.

https://preview.redd.it/tjur78i8l6ke1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7b653d98e98513bb8e007e5d5dc8fb35ebd0aed

OpenAI has introduced a new benchmark designed to evaluate AI’s capabilities in software engineering, aiming to measure performance across debugging, code generation, and system design.

* SWE-Lancer features over 1,400 freelance software engineering tasks from Upwork, spanning from minor bug fixes to high-value feature implementations.
* The benchmark evaluates both coding and technical management decisions of LLMs, challenging them to write code and select engineering proposals.
* It introduces monetary metrics, with success measured by how much a model could theoretically ""earn"" by completing tasks correctly.
* All top models struggled on the benchmark, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet performing best — solving nearly half of the tasks and earning $400k out of the $1M.

**What this means:** This benchmark could become a key tool for assessing AI-driven development and may push AI further into automating software engineering roles. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/02/19](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211)\]

If you’re looking for a **Heartstopper AU** with **rainy English streets, awkward first crushes, slow-burn romance, and just a sprinkle of existential crisis**, then A Different Light might be your next favorite read. It’s a **work in progress**, and I’m updating regularly, so do come along for the journey!

📖 **Synopsis:**

>A new school. A new country. A new chance to start over. Matthew Grant thought this year would be simple—get good grades, keep his head down, maybe even figure out where he belongs. He *wasn't* planning on Sean Callahan. With his easy laugh and unwavering confidence, Sean throws Matthew's carefully constructed world off balance. As their friendship deepens, Matthew finds himself asking questions he's never dared voice. About faith. About love. About the kind of future he's allowed to want. And whether he's ready to risk everything for the truth.

🌟 **What to Expect:**

✔️ **Heartstopper AU** – same vibes, new characters ✨

✔️ **Work in progress** – aka, come suffer in real time as I update! 📖😌

✔️ **Slow-burn romance** – staring for too long, accidental touches, *HELP*

✔️ **Faith & self-discovery** – but make it ✨ gay ✨

✔️ **Found family & friendships** – banter, late-night chats, chaotic group dynamics

✔️ **Boarding school & cozy England vibes** – football, art class, *so much rain*

✔️ **A touch of angst, but mostly warm feels** – because *feelings are hard*, okay?

If that sounds like your cup of tea (…or coffee, no judgment), come check it out! 

Let’s scream about Matthew’s emotional turmoil TOGETHER.

My sophomore year of college, I started birth control. I also started eating like 5 meals a day. Burgers, tacos, brownies, ice cream, etc. I ate a lot even when I was full because I wanted to finish my plate and gain weight (in my thighs and boobs). At this time, I didn't know what a calorie was. I never looked at them, and didn't care in the slightest. However, I started seeing weight gain everywhere. It was noticeable for once in my life. 

I decided to go on a diet. I became obsessed. I started planning my meals, and eating the lowest calorie option of everything. I began binging on low calorie chips, chocolate, and ""healthy meals"". Fast foward, I've been on my ""diet"" for about a month or two now. This week, I've binged about 6 times. My lowest point was yesterday, when I binged twice. Yes, twice. I skipped lunch but decided to go home to make a coffee. At home, I had 3 toasts with peanut butter, 12 oreos, some crackers, brownies, cookies, and chips. I was so disgusted with myself I decided to leave the house and skip dinner. I skipped dinner and when I got home, our chef (i live in a sorority house) made brownies and pasta for dinner. It looked so good I have 5 HUGE brownies and about 3 plates of pasta. My stomach hurt so much afterwards. I haven't been able to go 2 days without binging. I am constantly thinking about food, my next meal, and calories. Please help. My end goal is to be skinny with a flat stomach. I also work out everyday and get 10k steps a day.

Ko has become worried about the financial well-being of telehealth doctors - and no, not because of the increased price of hospital coffee (it's getting ridiculous now!)

**Why?** 

Because he believes the **current time-based billing system** for online consultations undervalues experienced doctors and their clinical acumen.

What may take a junior doctor 30 minutes, a veteran doctor may be able to spot diagnose. 

**Ironically, this quick efficiency means** ***less*** **money for the expert.** 

Yep, being *too good* at your job could hurt your paycheck. The system unintentionally rewards inefficiency, which is bad for pretty much everyone involved—except the slowpokes, of course.

*C’mon guys, can we leave pay-per-minute to therapists and...adult hotlines?*

**The AI Problem:**

Ko believes that this is only going to get *worse* with generative AI creeping into the clinical setting.

To Ko, your doctor sneakily slipping in a ChatGPT search for your sore throat shouldn’t affect their paycheck, as they still need to verify that the AI is making sense. 

*Fair enough I guess, although I stopped questioning AI when it correctly identified my ex-girlfriend cheating on me. (Honestly, how did I miss the signs?😣).*

**So, what's the Fix?**

He is collaborating with Dr Tachinardi and Dr Warm to create–*surprise, surprise*– an **AI-enabled billing model.** 

This new system will:

✅ Incorporate **clinical judgment**

✅ Factor in **medical expertise**

✅ Balance that with **time spent** on patient care

This should create a billing structure that finally pays doctors for **what they know**, not just **how long** they take. *Nice.*

1itk1f0,https://i.redd.it/yub3f8oik6ke1.png,Should Meta Runner Continue as a Comic?,"That's my Question

I always thought would be cool to see what happens next however since there's a chance we might never get season 4 would be cool to continue the story in Comic form you know yeah Glitch made one-shot but it never went anywhere I like to see done by professionals that are fans of the Series or at least fans of Video games

My top 3 picks for publisher would be IDW, Oni Press or Skybound/Image Comics

My idea is start with an issue #0 with Tari and Theo going into a server that has doors based on many titles from the publisher like if it's Skybound/Image Comics she would meet Invincible then the Cast from Walking Dead and Fire Power then meets Optimus Prime possibly(because of the Energon Universe) then goes to possibly world of other Image Comics titles then it ends setting up issue #1 and the first actual issue

if it's IDW It's mostly same thing basically the same thing she meets the Ninja Turtles, SONIC then cast of the main Star Terk comic and The Rocketeer

The opening arc would be set a year after the Series Finale and stuff happens Tari knows she has to warn her friends and the world and it's something and that is just the opening arc there's like an filler issue or issues in between that just few days with Tari and the Rest just chilling we see her getting coffee and a girls night out and reading a comic book and starting a duck collection like those relaxing issues between Arcs stuff they couldn't do in the show at least not muc

My vision for a the creative team would be Ryan North(Dinosaur Comics, Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, Fantastic Four and STAR TREK: Lower Decks) with art by Rachel Stott(Super Girl, Fantastic Four, Supergirl) with guest artist drawing te video Tari Enters with a backup story also written by Ryan North and art by Sarah Myer(Saturday Morning Ninja Turtles Adventure) which is comic sequel to Theo spin-off pilot it basically starts where it left off

Don't you think that would be cool? I do Specially with the right Writer and Artist on it also Cover Artist 

Plus the potential for many spin-off comics just think about it cool right?

Update previous post above – The weekend before valentines day on the Saturday me (30HLM) and my partner (30LLF) had a lovely morning with a coffee walk along the coast to a beach and swim, spending some time before returning home and had some time to kill before an event in the evening. Decided we’d have a nap (luxury of not having kids) due to a busy week. The nap was nice and finished with a bit of time cuddling which is not the usual. After cuddling for some time I naturally became interested in taking it a bit further and start touching and kissing with minimal return (the usual) but no rejection so after a bit of time I ask if I could go down on her. There was a less then enthusiastic 'yes' however consent was gained and easily got her going and got her to O after 5 or so minutes. After she settled I pulled her into a hug on top of me and told her that we don’t have to have sex however she tried inserting and after 1 min with me knowing it wasn’t comfortable for her, told her it’s alright and we stopped. We continued lying there hugging and was a good opportunity for me to ask some questions like – whether she masturbates at all? Nah not really. If she has a vibrator? Use to however threw it out (very interesting). After hearing this I told her my thoughts that masturbation is a great stress relief as well as if she doesn’t know what she likes then how am I to know what she likes. We had to get ready to go at this point but there wasn’t any awkwardness so was feeling quite positive about this event. 

During the week I purchased a vibrator that I’ve had friends say is great and the reviews are solid too, the womaniser. Hoping this would allow for further conversation. My partner also sent me a reel clip of a podcast with a sex therapist and other women with the title “I thought I was broken for not wanting sex” and she even suggested we listen to the podcast. I thought this was great and said we should in the car ride we have to do Friday evening (Valentines day). Come Friday I made pancakes in bed for her and eat together having a nice morning before work. The package arrived during the day and I collected it and brought it home. When I got home she asked what was in the package and I told her “its your replacement” straight away I see a change in demeanour and asked if “I had stepped over the line” to which she responded “yes you went over the line” turning away from me and making me feel like I just had a door slammed in my face. 

During the car ride you could hear a pin drop, I tried making small talk however was getting nothing. When we got to open road I suggested we listen to the podcast however was declined. She then says shes tired and I told her to sleep and I’ll be right driving. The rest of the trip I just felt like my heart had been crushed literally welling up on the drive. How could there be so much progress to then have the carpet pulled all due to my poor timing. Should’ve listened to the podcast first before showing the present but hey that’s how it is.

1itjxhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildofHoarder/comments/1itjxhi/not_sure_when_to_give_up/,Not sure when to give up?,"My house has been filled with clutter and junk for essentially as long as I can remember. I was not able to have friends over due to the shame and embarrassment my parents held about our living situation, while simultaneously never doing anything to fix it. Twice, in high school, I committed to multi-month long cleaning projects just to get the house to look somewhat passable or normal. Once for when I participated in a foreign student exchange program (we can't bring somebody here from another country and have them live in this, so I guess that motivated them. Clean it for somebody else, not for your own child.) or when I begged and begged them that I wanted to host my own high school grad party just like every other friend I had did. 

I remember always feeling so upset and frustrated that I had to give up so much of my time and life to help clean somebody else's mess. Why do I have to spend every free hour I have after school and work to clean up after my parents? I want to hang out with my friends and play video games. I remember my mom getting frustrated with me when I started working often, on top of being in high school and doing after school sports. It's just always felt so unfair.

  
Even after cleaning our house for my grad party, I remember returning back home for winter break after my first semester at college to find my childhood bedroom had been turned into an 'office' for my mom. A replacement for her other two offices that had been swallowed by the mess, turning 3 total bedrooms into unusable rooms that now nobody ever goes in because you can't step over the junk filling the doorway, much less the rest of the room. I had to sleep on the couch for the entire break. I remember just thinking, do they even care about me? How could somebody who loves me do this to me? Taking away the room I had grown up in only served to completely erase any feeling that the house was my home. 

I definitely remember clearly thinking that at the time: I no longer had a home there. Even now, when I go over multiple times a week to see them, the only way I can sit with them to have dinner is for us each to sit in separate places in a room filled with clutter. Me on a lounge chair surrounded by stacks of papers and books and cases covered in dust, my dad at his desk completely covered in the same kind of mess, and my mom sitting at the only spot on an 8 person couch that isn't completely covered in clutter.

  
My parents are both in their late 60s/early 70s, and they have talked about wanting to move out of our home state for a long time, just like myself. They even bought an amazing house in a different state that we've gone to visit while it gets remodeled for the last few years. But what fills me with dread and makes me depressed is the thought that they are NEVER going to be able to leave. It's just not possible to move with an entire house, two garages and multiple storage units worth of JUNK. Somehow we've been left with every piece of family memorabilia from my grandparents passing away (both sides!), so no we can't get rid of that wardrobe that's been sitting on the porch outside for the last 6 months because I need to see if my niece wants it. My mom works with me to clean the hoard, and talks to me about being motivated and wanting to see change, but is never able to give anything away, even if its obviously trash. We found an old dusty coffee maker that has not seen the light of day in 6 years or more and her first instinct was to say ""oh, maybe this one is better than the one we're using right now!"" I just wanted to smash it on the ground and ask HOW COULD THAT POSSIBLY BE TRUE? My dad never lifts a finger to help. I don't know what to do.

I've been a long time lurker and I'm finally writing today because this week, for some unknown reason, I've been motivated to work on cleaning. I'm living in my grandparents old house that was also swallowed by the mess, and have been here for maybe 2.5 years. There's a room here completely filled that I've not been able to use the entire time I've lived here. Recently I just finished cleaning the laundry room, which felt like a huge accomplishment. I've started to work on the garage as well, and have found things from cute old family photos, to my grandparents tax returns from 1998, 1999, and 2000. I'm 24 years old. Those papers were put into boxes and stored away since before I was ever born. 

A year ago when my ex lived with me, we started cleaning the garage while my parents were out of town by just going in and throwing away piles of boxes and chairs and art supplies that will never get used. We found a water leak that had covered the entire garage and ruined probably 30 boxes full of things because it went completely unnoticed because nobody ever goes in the garage for any reason. I also found actual black mold in the box at the very bottom of the pile, and even then my mom insisted I don't throw anything away until she came back into town to look through things.

While cleaning the garage, today I was taking an unopened package for an outdoor floodlight that came with batteries to dispose of, because all of the batteries had completely corroded. It must have been in the garage for 5+ years based on the coverage of dust, and of course the complete erosion of the battery acid. My mom saw the box and said that she wanted to keep the light to use it. I snapped at her asking why would she use it now when she hasn't used it for the last 5 years its been in the garage? Plus its covered in corrosive battery acid. Its disgusting. I'm embarrassed to say that I slammed my car door when talking to her about this, which led to her feeling shame and shying away from me, just like it always goes every single time she tries to keep a piece of trash and I get mad and ask her why. I'm already dealing with so much in my personal life and with depression. Whenever my mom and I try to work together, it always goes the same way: she tries to keep something that is obvious trash and I get frustrated, and then she tells me I make her feel like a failure of a mother and a parent.

  
I just want my parents to move to their dream house out of state. They're old now, all I have been able to think about the last 5 years whenever we clean the hoard is how if they both died randomly one day, I'd probably have to take an entire year off of my life just to work on cleaning and disposing of the things they own. I just want them to be happy, and I don't understand why it has to take me giving so much of my time and life to force them to try and fix it. I can't just leave my parents, but I can't help but think that if my mom is trying to keep trash like she has been even just this week, nothing will ever change for as long as they both live.

Its gotten to the point were I cannot smoke (I am a social smoker) or drink coffee, because I start feeling like I am about to have a panic attack. I have scheduled a doctor's appointment to ensure nothing is actually wrong with me, but I don't think I'll manage to calm down until then.

1itjo9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1itjo9v/advice_for_coping_with_changes_in_living_situation/,Advice for Coping with Changes in Living Situation?,"This is gonna be a long info dump because I mostly came here to vent. Sorry if it’s not interesting to you. I want to get people’s input over whether or not the things my BF’s family has done would also bother you as an autistic or non-autistic person, or whether I’m just generally being fussy or overreacting. 

I go to school across the country so my living situation is kind of precarious. During any school break, I usually go back home, but when I’m in class, I live with my boyfriend at his mother’s home.

This house is rural and very big (by my standards). There is also an attached studio apartment. The tenant who used to live there moved out, so my bf’s brother and his fiancé decided to move in.  I asked why my bf and I couldn’t move in to the apartment, and he said it’s because the brother has dogs and they’re paying more in rent because they have full time jobs. Fair enough, but it struck a nerve in me because I’ve been wanting to adopt a puppy for years but was told that there is not enough space in the house for another dog. 

The brother and fiancé moved in. The process of them moving in was pretty traumatic for me because there were a lot of loud noises, and a lot of stuff in the house ended up crowded and displaced. I went home across the country for school break. When I came back, all of my belongings  that had been outside of my bedroom (the garage and the basement) had been moved around, and I hadn’t been given notice. Some of my stuff had even been thrown away by the brother. I picked it out of the garbage. I’m also really sensitive to my stuff being touched/moved because I moved houses a lot as a kid and my parent would throw away my stuff without telling me in the process. My boyfriend also moved a few handfuls of my stuff out of our room and into the guest room to give me more space. 

All of my ethnic food was taken out of the pantry, put in a cardboard box (by the mother I think?) and put on the floor in the dining room. This is an aside but I feel like there are some micro aggressions around my diet because I’m a vegetarian and the only non-white person in the house. 

I also realized that even though the brother and fiancé have their own apartment, they weren’t planning on working in it. They moved all of their monitors, laptops, and office chairs into the kitchen and conjoined dining room, so then whenever I had to use the kitchen, they would be in there listening to meetings without headphones.

They also have their own kitchenette in the apartment, but they choose to do ALL of their cooking/snacking/coffee making in the main house. I have kitchen anxiety. Growing up I was taught not to start cooking if someone else is cooking the kitchen. I’m sure that’s pretty old school, but by instinct I try to stop cooking ASAP and leave the kitchen if someone else starts cooking. If you recall, all my groceries were put on the floor in the dining room, right underneath the ass of the brother’s office chair.

I just stopped cooking and eating entirely. Someone cooks a meal for the “whole” family every night, but they always cook meat so I don’t eat it. I’ve always cooked for myself but now I don’t even come downstairs to the kitchen anymore. 

Everyone also has their own bathroom. The mother has a private bathroom, the brother and fiancé have a bathroom in their apartment, and my BF and I have a bathroom in the hall next to our room. The problem is that the laundry machine and dryer are in “our” bathroom, so ours is treated like a communal bathroom. I have never seen a family do so much laundry. It took me two weeks to do one load because everyone was always running something. The brother and fiancé just keep their dirty laundry on the floor of our bathroom. 

I have an autoimmune condition, so I have to go to the bathroom a lot (both to pee and bathe). Now I’m having panic attacks having to compete with everyone to use that bathroom. Flash forward to last week. I hear rustling in the guest room, which is facing our bedroom. I found out that the fiancé had moved her entire office into the guest room, and without telling me they had once again moved my stuff without asking me. They also started growing mushrooms in the bedroom. This triggered my meltdown. 

I have been begging my boyfriend for years if I could grow mushrooms. This is my one passion/fixation, especially because I’m a vegetarian and am very environmentally conscious. For years he’s told me no. 

That guest room was also where I used to do my Zoom meetings and cry on the phone to my family back home about my struggles with the living situation. Now I have nowhere to go to talk in private. Now the fiancé does all her work in the guest room with the door open, often with no headphones, so every time I have to leave the room to go to the bathroom she’s right there. She also started to use our bathroom because it’s 10 feet closer than the bathroom in her apartment. Thing’s have gotten so bad my autoimmune-related health has declined because I’ve been taking less baths and drinking less water. I got a UTI from holding in my pee.

I’m at my wit’s end, and I just feel despair and resentment. Why can’t they work/ eat/do anything in their own apartment? I’m jealous they have their own private space in the apartment but choose to colonize every single available space in the main house. I’m jealous they feel entitled to do everything I’ve asked permission to do but have gotten denied. It’s hard for me to air grievances because my boyfriend’s family is the type where no one has yelled at each other ever, and I feel like I am a guest in the house because everyone else is family. The act of me audibly crying so that anyone in the house can hear sends my bf into full-blown physical illness. He does not like conflict. I've talked with him about my struggles. He is generally very sympathetic, but his solutions are always him offering to make unrealistic self-sacrifices and saying he doesn't know what else to do. I’m just ending up staying at campus all day (which is 40 minutes away!), even when I have nothing to do there. It sucks because I’m not that productive or comfortable on campus.

Any advice for me to better cope with these changes? Would you have issues with this stuff too? Are my problems autism-related or is this just me being picky and entitled. For anyone who’s not autistic, would you have a problem with any of this stuff?",1,1740006828.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

Things have been going well so far. He'll text me throughout the day and we see each other a couple times a week. I like him a lot but have some reservations about his relationship with his best friend.

They have been friends for a few years and talk about everything. He'll text her a lot throughout the day and they hang out almost every day. He'll do things like drive her places and bring her coffee and stuff she likes. They dated a while ago for a short period (like a few weeks) but broke up because of cultural differences. His family is religious and wanted him to be with someone of the same background, which she is not. I know this hurt him a lot, but they both decided to be friends as they didn't want to lose each other. She is the first person he's said ""I love you"" to.

He swears that they are just friends and things wouldn't work between them romantically. However, when I bring up my concerns about their relationship, he also says that she is one of the most important people in his life and he doesn't want to lose that. Am I being unreasonable for feeling uncomfortable about this?

Event Server- asked about my experience and how to set up a table for plated service. Then asked how I would serve wine to the table. Then asked about the difference in service from event server and restaurant service. 

Cook- I was asked temperatures of walk-in and freezer, how to make a hollandaise and what color cutting boards are used for raw meat and for fish. I was also asked what knives I had in my knife kit.

Brand ambassador- asked how I would get people to stop and talk about brand and how I would handle a negative comment about the brand.

Barista-asked how to make an americano, what is the purpose of tapping down the espresso in the porta filter and difference between drip coffee and espresso.

My first coach call she just asked questions about each position like how to hold a plate or temperature of chicken but never asked about my experience. Total time of the call took about 30 minutes.

#▌Main stories covered:

&gt;- \*\*\[NEWS\]  Monde Nissin takes another massive Quorn “L”...\*\* **Monde Nissin** \[MONDE 8.42 ▼0.4%; 92% avgVol\] \[\[link\](<https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=6b3633acf3b544d6ec6e1601ccee8f59>)\] provided “guidance” on its FY24 full-year results to say that its consolidated sales grew 3% and that its “consolidated core net income” grew 25%. MONDE said that its “ongoing annual impairment test for the Meat Alternative business indicates a significant charge this year”, which MONDE estimated to be “between GBP 80 mn and GBP 100 mn” (₱5.8 billion to ₱7.3 billion), and that, “due to unfavorable changes in volatility, interest rates, and stock prices”, MONDE “anticipates a material mark-to-market loss on the fair value of our guaranty asset.”

&gt;    - \*\*\*MB:\*\*\* Few things have made less sense to me than MONDE’s obsession with Quorn. I’m not a MONDE shareholder, but if I was, I’d be pretty angry about the nearly ₱40 billion in impairment charges that shareholders have been forced to swallow thanks to Quorn’s continuing top-line and bottom-line weakness. Quorn sucks, and just about the only good thing that we can say about it is that the adversity makes MONDE’s guidance that it will turn a net income and have enough unrestricted retained earnings to consider dividends all the more impressive. It’s like if we consider the world of business to be a marathon, and MONDE is running that marathon next to all the other competitors, but instead of a little belt with gels and electrolyte pills to help it push through the final 15 kilometers, it decided to wear a backpack filled with concrete. In this case, yes, the concrete is a clever metaphor for Quorn, both in terms of its uselessness as a running aid and business segment, but also in terms of its taste when integrated into various recipes. But back to the race, MONDE is struggling and sweating. MONDE is making deals with the devil in its head. Gripping the straps of the backpack tight, MONDE digs deep, scrapes its soul raw, and finishes the marathon in just over six hours. Most of the other runners have already finished and showered. Sure, the walkers are still out on the course, but MONDE finished that race with the concrete in its backpack. It beat the walkers! But -- hear me out -- what if MONDE just dropped the backpack in the first 5 kilometers when the strain of carrying it first became overwhelmingly apparent? There are no special prizes for finishing the race with a backpack full of concrete. It’s just, did you finish, and if so, how long did it take? This must be some kind of personal advocacy, bankrolled by shareholders, because I just don’t get it.

&gt;- \*\*\[NEWS\]  SM Prime posts record annual profit of ₱45.6B...\*\* **SM Prime** \[SMPH 23.15 ▲1.3%; 84% avgVol\] \[\[link\](<https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=8555bc93a99ed108ec6e1601ccee8f59>)\] teased its FY24 full-year results, including a record annual profit of ₱45.6 billion driven by “higher contributions from all of its business segments”. Consolidated revenues were up 10%, driven by “higher rental income, real estate sales, and revenues from services and experiential offerings.” SMPH reported that malls accounted for 55% of its revenue, “residences” account for 34%, hotels and convention centers for 6%, and offices and warehouses for 5%. SMPH said that its Q4 results were the best quarterly earnings it has ever seen, achieving both all-time highs in revenues (₱40.6 billion, up 14%) and net income (₱11.8 billion, up 19%).

&gt;    - \*\*\*MB:\*\*\* This is a big part of why we aren’t going to see that SMPH REIT anytime soon. This group is just printing money. They’re flush with cash. They don’t need to sell a huge chunk of their income stream to raise money to fund expansion; they’re making enough money to do that on their own. They’ll always have the ability to whip a REIT (or two) out to solve any funding shortfalls in the future if needed, but why jump through all those hoops and lightly handcuff your use of REIT sale proceeds if you simply don’t need to? One thing that jumped out at me was the line at the top of the press release, where SMPH referred to itself as “one of the leading integrated property developers in Southeast Asia”. This is a line that they’ve been using for a while now, but I didn’t notice it until now. That’s a type of branding that is usually reserved for companies that are looking to step out of their “home country” to play with the big boys at the regional level. **Jollibee** \[JFC 252.20 ▼1.9%; 83% avgVol\] comes to mind. Here, SMPH’s only real non-PH activity is in China, and even then, it’s basically restricted to building malls. To the best of my knowledge, none of its other business segments have any exposure to China, and none of its segments have exposure to countries in SE Asia that aren’t China or the Philippines. I wonder if we’ll start to see that change as the group runs out of high-ROI map to saturate.

1itjjo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1itjjo5/how_can_i_manage_my_mother_she_comments_on/,"How can I manage my mother? She comments on EVERYTHING! (grab a coffee, this is a rant)","Raised by Nmother, just like all of us here. (35F) and husband (38M) moved back from another country 2 weeks ago, so we are currently staying at my parents' until we move into our new place in less than a week. In total we would have stayed at their house 3 weeks. Mother has always been very difficult to deal with, she comments on absolutely everything everyone around her does, as if she is living in that person's body and it affects her directly. It's way too difficult to even have a conversation because 1. she gaslights the living daylights out of you, 2. she makes you feel like it's your fault for whatever thing SHE did wrong and 3. she will never accept any form of boundary-setting, telling you, even at an adult age that you're doing things the wrong way or you're a child, or there is only one way to do it. It's been difficult staying with them because she will comment on absolutely everything my husband eats. We are fit people who love the gym, my husband goes to crossfit, and I do HIIT training. I have not done it in the last 3 months because we travelled a lot before we moved back and we also just wanted to enjoy the last country we lived in for all its culinary glory - we love to eat. So I put on 3-4kg - I usually weigh 64kg, I am not worried about my weight, I'm happy and I love food and right now, I cannot wait to return to my glorious gym I used to go to in my country for 6 years before we moved away - I have friends there and it's just a great place, so I am going from next week. (Why am i even justifying this? This is how narc mums get into your head) 

Anyway, during our time with my parents, whatever we've been eating has always received comments from my mother - too much food, too salty, you eat too much, you got fat, you guys eat a lot! She eats very little, has a very wrong idea of nutrition and thinks carbs are bad, salt will give you instant high blood pressure and they are now approaching 70 so they need to be 'careful'. Great for you, but don't impose this on us, who are still young! Aside from the comments to me, and gesticulating at the table a round, fat person and pointing at me when I eat, she also comments on how much my husband eats, directly to him making him feel bad about food and fat shaming us collectively. 

On top of this, my father is just this hugely passive man, who is basically a skeleton cos she doesn't allow him to eat too much. He's so tall and weighs 74kg...He's always been under her thumb and under her control, and he's gotten so bad that he's asking her for permission to eat a little piece of chocolate after dinner. Pathetic. He's always asking for permission for most things. It's gotten to the point where we have a piece of toast at breakfast, and wait for them to leave to go to their gym (of course) to then continue eating more food because we are hungry! If we buy other foods, she will bombard us with questions about why we bought more food, what it contains, how it's full of chemicals, and how it's such huge quantities. When she comments about me having gotten fat, I tell her 'what is it to you? Are you the one eating? I am hungry and I want to eat! Plus I'm going to the gym next week, I am really not worried!' This morning I ate a piece of toast with avocado, I was hungry still, but was waiting for her to leave to eat more. My husband was already working so I went to cut another piece of bread to make him some breakfast. She commented about how fat I'd gotten and why am I eating AGAIN, so again I said, what does it matter to you? I am making this for my husband anyway, but why is this so important to you! As soon as I retaliated, in order to downplay my boundary setting and the fact that I was disagreeing with her (something she absolutely hates, because she must ALWAYS be right) she started telling me to stop yelling at her, which I was not, but she will find any excuse to put the spotlight back on me and highlight how misbehaved I am, rather than call attention to the fact that what she said was wrong.

She absolutely hates not being in control of everyone around her. She is retired, does absolutely fuck all all day long. Listens to politics podcasts most of the day, and tells us the end is near and just simply does not accept that when we say it's not how she sees things, she gets all raging mad about how incorrect we are. We just bought a car, of course the comments were endless...about the price, the reason, the fact that we are throwing money. Money is the number one topic for her. She asks about random people we will see at the weekend - what they do, where they live, comments about people's salaries or how loaded they are, comments about how most stuff is a waste. Anyway it's all just too much. Most of the shit she does makes my blood boil. Whatever I say never carries any weight or importance to her. She does nothing all day long and my dad is her puppy dog, cleaning everything around her while she sits on her ass. They both get overly involved in absolutely everything we do (eg: my dad texting me from the gym telling me to call the real estate agent to ask measurements about something in our new place) basically getting involved in stuff that doesn't even affect them in absolutely any way, which I'm not even concerned about. I'm grateful we could stay here until we found a place, and grateful we had food for free or whatever else, this is how it is in my culture so the free food and accommodation is a norm anyway, but I just forgot how dated her mentality was and how over the top involved they get and how doom-and-gloom they are. Now that I'm back, I'll see her a lot more and I just want to understand how to manage my behaviour and basically my anger because she makes my blood boil with all the unnecessary comments. I cannot even imagine having a kid would be like, she only thinks about herself. She already has a grandson, living further away, and for Christmas she didn't send him any presents (he's 3) 'because he already gets too many things'. The older she gets, the worse she gets and she's just extremely difficult to be around. Not to mention all the dirty looks she gives me all the fucking time. Never smiles, shes never happy, always worried about the state of the world. She didn't even ask us how life was in general in the last years living in the country we just came from, how we're doing in general. Nothing. I feel totally disconnected form her and like I'm grieving in a way. My husband's mother on the other hand is such a beautiful soul, nice mother who's loving and affectionate. Has nothing to her name, only debt and sadness after losing her husband, but she will give you the shirt off her back if you needed it. She will do everything for her kids and still does. She will drive everyone around in her shitty car that always breaks down, she will cook for everyone, run errands for you when you're there, iron your clothes if you're busy, she even irons my socks! She just has so much love to give and never judges, doesn't get involved in our things, she just helps out! My mother on the other hand, while we didn't have our new car, would stop my father from driving us (they live in the middle of nowhere, just a neighbourhood with houses, closest shop is 40 mins walk on a major busy road) to the shop or to the station. The drive is 5 mins, and she told me off a week ago telling me that we're using my dad like a taxi service (for the simple fact that my dad offered to drive us twice!) and she always stops him from offering to come pick us up or drop us off - IN 2 WEEKS - it's not like we're here everyday, and we're moving out...we've taken the bus that takes forever, just so we don't have to hear her comments or have walked to the shop like 5 times already - while they were at home doing absolutely nothing, both retired.

This was my first time going there, and it was quite fantastic despite the limited time there.  Not that exhausting surprisingly.   

Some previous prep before the trip - bought tickets with GetYourGuide for Musee d'Orsay, bought a top level champagne tour for the Eiffel Tower, bought tickets directly from the Louvre, and at exactly 3pm PT 3 days before, got free reservations for an afternoon tour of Notre Dame Cathedral.  Airline tickets were from a one-day United sale that I got for 25,000 miles each, round trip.  Made a reservation for the hotel about 4 weeks prior, 2 nights for 330 euros, 4 star hotel near Notre Dame cathedral.

 Took a late afternoon flight from IAD to CDG, which arrived a bit early, around 6:30am the next day.  Did manage to sleep most of the flight, which was a big help getting thru the next couple of days.  Went thru immigration in around 10 min.  Picked up luggage, went thru customs with no issues.  Went to the travel information desk on the 5^(th) floor in the T1 terminal (Tourisme Information desk), and rented a TravelWifi hotspot device.  For 5 Gb a day, the cost was around 7€ a day, which is pretty high to me, especially considering I could have just used AT&T on my phone for not much more.  (More on this later).  Also went down to the Relay store on the 2^(nd) floor to buy a USA-France (Europe) electric plug converter, which they were selling 2 for 15€.  A bargain, considering that in the US, many in-person stores that sell this type of adapter sells a universal adapter for $40.  Went to the ATM to get some Euros.  Finally, walked over to the door where the official taxis were (so many touts at the airport trying to get you to ride their taxi) and got a taxi.  The guy had a fixed price of 65€ to the Notre Dame Cathedral area, which he only took cash.  I thought that was a bit suspicious, but I had read on this forum that it was marginally acceptable that they didn’t take a card. 

 Finally got to the hotel around 9am or so.  We stayed at Hotel Atmosphere, since a few posters on here had recommended the place.  The staff all spoke English well. Checked in our luggage there and headed out wandering.  The only definitive thing on our itinerary was (supposedly) a 3:30pm trip to Musee d’Orsay.  In my mind for this day, I wanted to visit the Arc de Triomphe, walk the mile down Champs Elysees, take a ride on the Seine and head to the 13^(th) Arrondissiment for some Asian food in the evening. 

 Was finished with the Arc and in the middle of walking down the Champs Elysees as part of my game plan, and decided to get brunch, so went to Madrigal’s.  Not really a good choice, so expensive.  Pulled out my phone to look at the ticket for Musee d’Orsay and OMG, the ticket was for 9:30am and not 3:30pm.  Panicked and called the GetYourGuide tour company.  They couldn’t change the time and offered to refund the money, which I accepted.  On a whim, we decided to Uber over to Musee d’Orsay. So here’s the thing with the Metro – ordinarily I am a public transportation guy, but I was coming off of surgery and in no mood to navigate transfers and go up and down the subway, so we wound up taking about 6 Uber rides throughout our trip.  All the inter-Paris Uber trips costed 12€ to 14€.  Went to the museum, where voila, they accepted the ticket!  Very nice museum, spent 3 hours in there going thru all the Impressionistic paintings and such.  Strolled down the Seine afterwards, and decided to splurge for a one day Batobus ticket for 23€ each.  In retrospect, I would say that its not particularly worth it, because they have limited hours (10am-7pm) and the round trip takes almost 2 hours. Nevertheless, we took the boat from the Musee d’Orsay stop and went 2 stops to the Notre Dame Cathedral stop and then walked back to the hotel, with the idea that we would check in, and then go back and take the Batobus, doing a leisurely round-trip. 

 The walk from the Batobus to the hotel was around 10 minutes. Checked in at 3:30pm, and bam! Next thing you know, it was 8pm.  We overslept.  Oh well, no Batobus trip, no journey over to the 13^(th) Arrondissement.  Went searching outside from the hotel, for a restaurant to eat in, knowing that we might have some issues with getting in.  Sure enough, no availability at the La Petite Perigourdine on the next block.  But their sister restaurant, En Face de La Petite Perigourdine, kitty corner from the La Petite Perigourdine, was available and had some openings.  Tried their pot-au-feu and it was really good.  Afterwards, strolled over to the Notre Dame Cathedral where it was dark out but still enough lights to get some pictures in.  The guards were still around Saint Chappelle, so nothing was going on there.  Went over to Le Paradise du Fruit for a smoothie and sorbet and went home around 11pm. 

 The next morning, had breakfast at the hotel.  They had a decent breakfast buffet starting at 7am for 19€ and a slim breakfast for 12.5€.  One thing to note – there doesn’t seem to be any breakfast places open before 8am, not even McDonalds.  Uber’ed over to the Louvre for our 9am appointment.  Something seemed off as there were tons of police there with machine guns out.  Anyhow they told us that there was a delay and we wouldn’t get in until after 11.  Quickly decided to buy some tickets somewhere else.  Unfortunately I got Montparnasse Tower mixed up with Sacre-Cour de Montmartre, so wound up getting tickets to the Tower for a 10am appointment.  19 euros a ticket.  Lo and behold, as soon as I got the email for the Tower tickets, they started letting people in the Louvre.  Got in, ran over to the Mona Lisa like everyone else was doing.  Despite having a 10am appointment ticket for the Tower, we still stayed at the Louvre until around 10:30am, doing a speed run though the famous parts such as Venus de Milo and Nike of Samothrace.  Could and should have spent another couple of hours there, but we didn’t, oh well.  After catching another Uber, we guessed that the Montparnasse Tower security would still let us in.  And sure enough, we had no issues getting in.  Security did mention that trying to get in early was an issue, but getting in late was no issue.  Typical tall building, 56 stories, saw the sights.  Our next appointment wasn’t until 1pm at the Notre Dame Cathedral, so decided to fit in lunch in the Chinatown section, in the 13 Arrondissement. Went to Mandarin de Choisy for lunch.  Their menu was a combo of some dim sum plus traditional Chinese plates.  Meh lunch, nothing too special,  but of course we are spoiled since we live in the SF Bay Area.  37€ for the lunch.  Walked around the Chinatown area for a bit, then Uber’ed over to Notre Dame Cathedral. 

 It was mass chaos in the cathedral, no pun intended.  Not only was there mass ending, but hundreds of people apparently had a 1pm appointment.  Half of the allotted 30 minutes was spent waiting to patiently go thru the line around the church.  Massive place, but it seems like there’s still some renovating going on, and to be honest, I’ve seen more impressive places, such as the Notre Dame in Montreal.  Tried to go next door to Saint Chappelle, but there was a massive line there so we said fuggeaboudit.  We had our final appointment at 6:30pm, so decided to take the Batobus and ride around, probably to the Eiffel Tower, since we still had an hour or two left on our ticket.  Lo and behold, the wife lost her ticket.  Batobus offered no other solutions other than to buy another ticket, which we declined.  So instead, we walked around the Notre Dame Cathedral area, including trying to make an appointment for the highly acclaimed La Tour D’Argent restaurant, which they promptly told us no openings for the evening.  So walking back towards the hotel, we stopped by a bakery for some coffee, La Parisienne Saint Germain.  Place was decent.  After going back to the hotel and making sure we didn’t fall asleep at the hotel again, we decided to head out early to the Eiffel Tower, circa 3:45pm, almost 3 hours early for our 6:30pm appointment.   

 The Eiffel Tower area is beautiful, but two things spoiled some of the excitement of the area.  I got a text saying that my water bottle delivery was going to take place in the morning (in the US).  I had moved the delivery to the following week, but this company (Ready Refresh) has such a bad scheduling system, it often puts in phantom deliveries, so this isn’t the first time this has happened.  So I had to spend 40 minutes on the phone making an international call, using up my Skype credit plus eating up my power on my internet Hotspot device.  After all that time spent, I finally convinced the second line support to cancel the water delivery (the first line support guy was useless and I hate to have to do the “can I speak to your manager” bit, but I did).  After that, the internet Hotspot device somehow lost its power.  I took it out of my secure pants pocket to examine it but to no avail, it wouldn’t turn back on.  Luckily by that time, I was close enough to the Eiffel Tower to use its Wifi (pronounced “wee-fee” in France).   I put it back in my pocket, but sometime between that and the time I went back to the hotel later that night, it was not in my pocket anymore.  Maybe a pickpocket, since the restaurant and the Uber driver didn’t have it.  The other stressful thing was trying to find a bathroom.  Man, there is nothing in that area, no restaurants nearby either.  Finally got the “brilliant” idea to check into the Eiffel Tower circa 5:45pm, where voila there was a bathroom!  From the time we lined up to go up the Tower, circa 6:25pm until the time we actually got to the top was around 45 minutes.  We had the champagne option for Eiffel Tower tickets – I went for a (very) sweeter option called Moet & Chandon Rose Imperial, which was outstanding.  I need to find out where I can get this, really good stuff. I’m not a wine drinker at all, mostly soda and water. 

 Afterwards, went back home to the Notre Dame Cathedral area, to a restaurant called Café Panis across from the Notre Dame Cathedral.  Pretty decent food, had the Entrecote de bouef (found out that “French fries” are called frites fraiches) but given that the place was relatively empty at 8:30pm, I’d say probably an average place for the area.  Walked around a little bit, found a store that sold a women’s beret for 4€.  PSG jersey for 40€  was too high for me though.  Bought some other gifts as well.  Saw some of those North America – Europe electric plugs for 6€.  When I went back to the hotel, discovered my hotspot was missing, as mentioned before.  Tried to contact the Uber driver but got a disconnected phone.  Called the restaurant, but they didn’t have it either.   

 The next day, had breakfast at the hotel, then left for the airport at just past 8am, for a flight scheduled for 11:55am.  Uber cost was 39.96€ from Hotel Atmosphere, during non-rush hour it’s closer to 35€.  A lot better than taking a taxi for 65€ .  Didn’t get surcharged for bags. Got to the airport at 8:45am, 44 minute drive.  After taking care of business with the return of the hotspot (lack thereof), immigration, check bags in (I am United Premier which helps with a faster line) and with looking through a couple of stores and such, I did get to the United gate finally at around 10:15am.  Had to take a bus to the airplane.  So to the people asking about how much time to be at the airport before flight time, I would say 2 hours before boarding time, which usually means around 3 hours before flight time, is pretty ideal.  Went to Chicago where I got to meet up with 10 degree weather. ",4,1740006263.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,0.83,False

1itjd07,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1itjd07/persistent_pain_in_right_leg/,Persistent Pain in Right Leg,"Hello,

I (22M, 179cm, 55kg, Australian) have been experiencing persistent pain/discomfort in my right leg for the past few months now. It's an aching pain which runs from my right hip joint down to my ankle. It's most noticeable in my hip, knee and ankle, but I also feel it sometimes shooting down the back of my thigh and calf. Sometimes, it leads to spasms/cramps in my calf and foot.

At first, I thought I had pulled a muscle or something, but now I'm not so sure given how long the pain has lasted without getting any better or worse. Also, I don't really play any sports or do any intense physical activity which could explain a muscle strain.

If I sit on the couch and rest my feet on the edge of the coffee table, it gets worse. If I lay facedown on my bed (with my torse on the bed and my legs sticking off the edge) it gets worse. But walking around does not make any difference to the pain.

I have no major medical issues. I don't drink, smoke or use recreational drugs. I take 5mg dexamphetamine twice a day and I supplement with fish oil, magnesium glycinate and vitamin D3/K2.

  
Any insights would be appreciated - thank you!!!",1,1740006035.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1itjcgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1itjcgo/m27_feeling_guilty_for_leaving_f29/,M27 Feeling guilty for leaving F29,"TLDR : I love my F29 girlfriend but her adhd makes her a low functioning adult. Also her 2 dogs are causing a strain on our relationship (they’re destructive towards our house and keep running away). Is my unhappiness and my leaving her justified ?

I met my girlfriend ( F 29) in fall of 2023, im M 27. We had a good start to our relationship because we connected on an emotional level and we both felt like we could be open with each other and not judge each other, i also valued her alot because it seemed like she had an honest heart and really valued loyalty which i do too. When i first met her she seemed really down on her luck (fired from a good restaurant serving job) which ultimately hurt her financially and she had to find another serving job and also work another part time job at a coffee shop to make ends meet. She also lived by herself in a ghetto area studio apartment with her two dogs (outdoor breeds : husky and aussie). I on the other hand dont claim to be doing super fantastic in life but i have a stable full time factory job with full benefits and good job security. I was living at home with my parents at the time because i honestly have a good relationship with them and dont see the need to live by myself if i dont have to. It’s also important to note that she didnt even have a operational car at the time (both her jobs were walking distance) when meeting her but i didnt mind any of this because we had a good connection. Anyways.. (i met her as my server) asked her out and all is really good in the beginning. I never judged her for struggling at the time because like i said we had a good emotional connection. It’s also important to note that she has bad connections with her mom and her dad had passed away, so she’s not to close to family. Anyways im getting kind of tired of living at home and also she’s getting a notice that she’s getting evicted from her apartment because she was behind on payments (first redflag i stupidly ignored). Coincidentally a good friend of mine has the house next door to him on the market soon (his boss’ rental) and he extends the offer to me. As kind of a solution to both our problems i suggest moving in at January of 2024. We both only after a couple months of knowing each other move in. It was a nice and newly renovated house in a nice and quiet tiny town outside of the major city we live in (15 mins away) 3 bedroom 2 bathroom with a backyard and everything affordable and cheaper than her studio was if we split it which we did. Anyways after a few months i start noticing how much her adhd has a strain on her and she struggles with organizational tasks and keeping things clean. It’s needlessly messy alot of the times. And if we do clean everything, then it’s literally a mess again a week later if not 2 at the max. That alongside her dogs (which i dont think she should even have ,and dont even know how she managed to have those 2 specific breeds in a tiny studio apartment) being very destructive to our backyard and constantly escape. I was under the impression that the backyard would solve all the issues and we even went to the extent to buy 2 nice dog houses that they dont even use. So now instead they stay in a spare room that theyve damaged some of the carpet, blinds, and not to mention there’s hair everywhere. My girlfriend and her dogs totally disrespect that room ( she smokes her weed inside that room and it’s disgusting looking and smelling). Whenever i tell her the way she treats the room bothers me, she brushes me off and tells me not to tell her what to do and that she’ll get to it (which she never has and will). Her life has improved since she met me though, she has a newer functional car and she got a new full time job as a teachers assistant and also part time job as the bartender down the street but she still manages to have money it seems like. I on the other hand and almost done with my online school and will have my bachelors degree in a few months. Ive tried to tell her to do online school with me but she seems uninterested. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even respect her anymore because the dog situation, her adhd, and her willingness to level up in life and she just wants to fight me on everything. I’ve officially decided to move out in a few weeks and i feel terrible because ive given up on her. Any feedback would be appreciated as to what they think about the situation. I just wish she would get on some adhd medication and she could function normally as an adult. ",1,1740005998.0,relationships,6,1.0,False

1itjc0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1itjc0x/ooze_of_the_heart_pt_1/,Ooze of the Heart (pt 1),"""Cupid? And that's your real name?"" Hedge Rayland asked his newest patient, Devlin Cupid, a newly married man age 24, Tall, Average build, curly red hair, and seeking help with self-control. At least that's what it said on his patient application form he filled out a week prior.

Chuckling Devlin responded ""Yeah, it's real. I get that a lot. People just think I'm messing with em' given the hair and all."" He looked down at the oak coffee table at a half-drank cup of coffee that separated the two men as he finished his sentence.

Dr. Rayland's office had a warm venerable aspect to it, from the Victorian-style furniture to the posh lighting fixtures adorning the burgundy and emerald walls. Seeming out of time for the modern 1980s world they lived in. Rayland looked a man far out of his own age, only 33 he carried himself very properly with combed-back brown hair and a tidy mustache, a vest with a black blazer and an antique pipe he would puff on occasionally throughout his appointments. However the addition of Rayland's light Bostonian accent made for a contrasting persona, the voice not matching the face and all that. Devlin didn't quite know what to make of the man. 

""A fine name son, no worries of it, now what I like to do for first appointments is break the ice a little. I tell you something about me, you tell me something about you, so on and so forth. For instance, crosswords, I adore a good crossword in the morning, really gets the brain moving, y'know what I mean?"" Hedge said, giving Devlin a calming gaze, sitting in anticipation. 

Nothing, Devlin just sat there giving a blank-faced open mouth stare at the Dr.

With a wide-eyed grimace, Rayland leaned forward and gave a gesture of ""Okay now you go"" 

The red haired man's gears finally started cranking as he fumbled with his words ""Oh ugh yeah, I ugh, football, I like watching football"" 

""Ah, football very nice! A big sports fan!"" Rayland exclaimed, internally thinking ""Wow this guy is the real deal, a true bonafide dullard""

""Okay so you're a sports guy, I'm a words guy. How about you tell me what you do for work?"" Rayland inquired not wanting to drag this appointment out longer than he needed.

""I work down at Hemms, you know the chemical disposal plant near the Commonwealth flats, I ugh. Well you know I take out the old barrels and ugh. I put em in the trucks and the guys, they ugh they take em away."" Devlin stuttered out

""Oh disposal work, keeping the earth clean, very noble work my friend"" Rayland kept a very professional front but could not get this over with faster, he had spent the night prior with a slim, dark hair 25 year old he met down at Muse. Up until 3am, barely a drop of sleep and a hangover that could put a bear into early hibernation.

Wanting to get on with the appointment Rayland asks ""So I see you're having issues with impulse control? What exactly are these impulses of yours?""

Nervously Devlin responds ""Well you see doc, I ugh. Now haha now this is gonna sound just so out there, but it's about my ugh. My wife ya see."" Devlin pauses

""Your wife? Is there some kind of overzealousness you have with your wife in a sexual manner? You know that's pretty normal for newlyweds Mr. Cupid."" Rayland rebutted 

""Oh no no haha no it's nothing like that at all doc, I ugh ha we don't exactly do that"" visible uncomfortable Devlin adjusts himself in his chair.

""Hmm okay well what is it then?"" Rayland becoming more impatient with every interaction with Devlin and he fears his frustration is starting to show.

""Well you see, I want to kill my wife."" Devlin stated in a cool and collected time ""I want to cut her open and pull her heart right out of her chest."" The man's tone changed on a dime.

A chill runs up Rayland's spine as he stares at the coffee cup in front of him, wide-eyed, not quite sure if he should make eye contact, he just lets Devlin continue.

""I just love her so much doctor, I can't stand to see anyone even look at her, I want to take her away from this gawking world. Take her heart and put it in my pocket."" Devlin says, grasping at something invisible with his hand.

Finally looking up to the man Rayland finds his cold gray eyes staring directly at him. Another chill runs up his spine and into his head, rattling his brain with a shiver. A primeval desire to get the hell out of this room right now almost overtakes him. 

""N-now, why would you want to go and do that, Devlin?"" Stammered Rayland.

""Mr. Cupid if you don't mind, doctor."" Devlin stated plainly

""Oh, ugh, of course, sorry Mr. Cupid."" it seemed Rayland had the roles reversed on him and he felt like the scared bumbling idiot now. 

""Didn't you hear me before doctor? I love her."" A smirk crept up on Devlin's face as he spoke.

""That's what I'm not understanding here. Mr. Cupid, if you loved her, well why on earth would you want to take her life?"" Questioned Rayland.

""Wouldn't you do anything for the ones you love, doctor? She made vows to me, not to this vile world, not to these sick people. To me. I need to take her away from it all before it's too late.""
Again another overwhelming urge to flee washed over Rayland, fighting it back with all his will he sat planted and tried to keep his composure.

""But, why tell me any of this?"" Not knowing if he wanted the answer to that question or not

""Well, cause you killed your wife too, Dr. Wayland. Isn't that right?"" Asked Devlin ""You smothered her to death in her sleep, you're just like me"" giving a devilish grin.

""DONG"" The antique clock rang off signaling an end to the appointment.

""Well, that's our time!"" Rayland shot up and quickly hurried to rush Devlin out of the door.

""Oh, uh, oh already doc?"" Devlin's previous demeanor returned as the act of Rayland grabbing and rushing the man out.

""I am afraid so lad, all the time we have today"" hastened Rayland. 

""Oh uh, okay doc I uh I guess same time next week huh?"" Asked Devlin.

""Yes yes lad, same time, best be off now."" Rayland rushed 

""Okay bye d...."" Rayland slammed the door on Devlin before he could finish his sentence.

Turning quick the doctor rushed over to his cupboard and poured a stiff glass of gin, dowing the floral liquor Rayland took a deep gasping breath ""Fucking madman, crazy fucking psychotic madman!"" 

""You smothered your wife in her sleep."" The words rang in his mind. 
""Did I hear him right? Rayland? No Wayland!"" Rayland shouted. ""He got me confused for Duluth Wayland!"" Another practicing therapist Wayland had been in the news recently but only by name. Remembering the still active case from earlier in the year, the police suspected murder and Wayland was high up in the list of possible suspects.  

""I just got roped into some maniac's murderous delusion over mistaken identity!!!"" Rayland bent over with the anticipation of vomiting. 

""BZZZZZ!!"" The buzzer to Rayland's office went off and the door swung open, Chelsea Valenta, Rayland's 24 year old receptionist. Chelsea had been working for Rayland for the better part of three years now screening clients and collecting payments. She came marching in over to Rayland with a deeply concerned look on her pale face, her blue eyes peeking through her soft blonde hair with worry. 

""Okay that guy, what the hell is up with him? He just walked past and gave me the craziest stare down I've ever seen."" She said in a whispered yell.

""I need you to get the police on the line now, that guy can't be allowed to go home to his wife."" Rayland said, adjusting his coat in an attempt to compose himself. 

________________________________________________

""His wife?"" The Boston police officer asked 

""Yes, he said he wanted to cut her open!  I really don't think we should take a chance with this guy."" Rayland said as he poured himself another glass of gin

""And he just up and told you all this, for no reason?"" Questioned the officer 

""No, I think he thought I was Duluth Wayland, similar names, same job. I think he just got me confused with that guy and he thought I would relate to him?"" Rayland knew how it sounded and could tell he wasn't exactly getting through to the cop in front of him.

""Look, can you just go and check up on him? Make sure nothing is going on?"" Rayland pleaded 

""As soon as you called in we went to the guy's apartment but no one was home, we'll try his work tomorrow to see if we can catch him there and take him in for evaluation. You said the Hemms plant right?"" The officer gave a reassuring gesture to the disheveled man.

""Yes that's correct, just please find this guy. In all my years I've never seen a man so resolute in his own bullshit."" Rayland said, speaking through lighting his pipe.

""We'll be on it, Doc. I promise. Look you've had a rough day, just go home and try to get some rest, we'll keep you updated okay?"" The cop put his coat back on and slipped out of the office. 

""Yes, very good, thank you officer. I'll be hearing from you"" Rayland waved the cop off and closed up his office for the night. Laying in bed after nearly a whole bottle of 80 proof gin, Rayland tossed and turned trying to get some shut eye but knew none would come to him this night, or any night soon. His hands trembled by the day's happenings and opted to do some late night reading. He decided to finally finish off Lightning by Dean Koontz, he'd been a sucker for a good horror novel since he was a boy growing up in midtown. They had an oddly soothing effect on him, often sending him off to his own dream world before he could finish a chapter. Tonight was no different, a mere 10 words away from the chapter's end Hedge Rayland was in a restless slumber.

1itjbct,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1itjbct/what_hurts_the_most/,What Hurts the Most.,"The office was the same as always—stale air, the hum of computers, the rhythmic clatter of keyboards. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting everything in a dull, artificial glow that seemed to seep into your bones. A dense fog of coffee and printer toner hung in the air, mingling with the artificial pine of the maintenance staff's morning cleaning routine. I settled into my chair with a quiet sigh as the familiar pain flared up again—deep, gnawing, radiating down my left leg like a slow-moving fire.

It had been bad for weeks, but today was unbearable. A deep, pulsing ache that burrowed into my bones, twisting and tightening with every breath. Nothing helped. It was relentless, like some creature had taken residence in my left side and was slowly, methodically, gnawing its way through me.

The morning meeting dragged on in the conference room. Jenkins from Marketing droned about quarterly projections while I tried to focus on anything but the burning sensation that radiated through me. The polyester office chair seemed designed specifically to amplify my discomfort, each slight adjustment sending fresh waves of pain through my body.

""Still bothering you?"" Greg's voice drifted over from the next cubicle after we returned. He was sipping his coffee—black, two sugars, the same way he'd taken it for the past seven years—with the usual lazy concern in his tone. Steam curled up from his ""World's Okayest Dad"" mug, a gift from his teenage daughter that he treasured despite its ironic intent.

""Yeah,"" I muttered, trying to find a comfortable position. ""Worse today.""

""You should really get that checked out, man.""

I just nodded, even though I knew I wouldn't. What could they do? Nothing ever worked. Not anymore. Besides, I'd had enough of doctors, enough of sympathetic faces and carefully worded explanations.

The morning crawled by. Sharp sensations shot through my left side with each breath, each small movement becoming an exercise in endurance. The numbers on my screen blurred together, my fingers hesitated over the keyboard, my mind drowned in the slow, unbearable throb that pulsed through me. The quarterly report I was supposed to be reviewing might as well have been written in Sanskrit.

Email notifications kept piling up. Each little ping felt like a personal attack, another demand I couldn't meet, another reminder of how much this pain was taking from me. The cursor blinked accusingly on my half-finished response to Corporate.

By lunch, I could feel the pity radiating from my coworkers. The way they glanced at me when they thought I wasn't looking, their voices softening when they spoke to me, as if volume itself might shatter me. Lisa from accounting—who hadn't said more than ""good morning"" to me in three years—suddenly appeared at my desk, offering to grab something from the vending machine. The concern in her eyes made me want to scream.

The break room was worse. Everyone huddled around their usual tables, conversations dropping to whispers as I microwaved my sad frozen dinner. I caught fragments: ""...hasn't been the same since..."" and ""...should take medical leave..."" The microwave hummed, masking their words but not their intentions.

The afternoon stretched endlessly. Meetings blurred together, a parade of PowerPoints and action items that barely registered. My calendar reminder for the 2 PM client call felt like a death sentence. I sat through it, camera off, muted except when absolutely necessary, letting the client's complaints about the latest software update wash over me like static.

Just Checking In

---


Sarah from HR stopped by my desk at 4:30, her forced cheerfulness more exhausting than the pain itself.

""Just checking in,"" she chirped, perching on the edge of my desk like we were old friends. ""You know, we have great resources for wellness here. And the employee assistance—""

""I'm fine,"" I cut her off, perhaps too sharply. ""Just a bad day.""

She retreated, leaving behind a pamphlet about workplace wellness that I immediately buried under a stack of papers.

The Silence at Home

---


The apartment was quiet when I got in, the only sound the low hum of the fridge and the distant wail of a siren somewhere in the city. I let out a long breath, sinking into the couch, pressing my fingers against my side in a useless attempt to knead the pain away. It was deep now, an unbearable weight pressing into my bones. The throbbing had become an agonizing pulse that seemed to echo through my entire body.

The silence felt oppressive. I flicked on the TV, letting some mindless reality show fill the space. Contestants argued over something trivial while judges made exaggerated faces of shock. The normal world, carrying on as if nothing had changed.

I needed sleep.

My dinner sat untouched on the coffee table—some microwave meal I'd grabbed from the freezer without really looking at the label. The thought of eating made my stomach turn. Instead, I peeled off my work clothes, every movement stiff and slow, and lowered myself into bed. The sheets were cold against my skin. I shifted, trying to find a position that didn't make it worse.

From my bedroom window, I could see into the apartment across the street. A family eating dinner, laughing about something. A normal evening in a normal life. The kind of life I used to have, before...

I lay there, staring at the ceiling, waiting for relief. The pain twisted deeper, a searing pressure that made my breath catch. Minutes stretched into hours as I drifted in and out of consciousness, the agony following me even into my dreams.

Finally, exhaustion won.

Waking Up to Reality

Sunlight filtered through the blinds when I opened my eyes. For a moment, the pain was distant, dulled by sleep. I pushed myself up, still groggy, ready to start another day.

Then I tried to stand.

The world tilted violently. My hands grasped at empty air as I crashed to the floor, shoulder slamming against the cold hardwood.

I looked down at my left side, where my leg should have been, and saw only a stump.",1,1740005915.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

On my last day, mao pay pagmeet namo sa one of our admin sad sa CDO na site. We only communicated through teams so after he signed the documents, wa na ko nag open ug teams kay done na akong business there. Unbeknownst to me, he messaged me in teams diay for coffee but nabasahan na nako when nabalik na ko sa among office. He asked about me sa iyang counterpart sa among site and we chatted sad pero ako oy last message(kaguol jud ni nako😭). Ni greet sad siya ug Happy Valentine's Day and ako nasad oy last message HAHAHAHA I don't really know if interested ba siya pero ulawan man daw siya ingon iyang counterpart pero tabian man sad siya gud.

Last week lang ko nauli sa city from CDO so fresh pa akong kilig HAHAHAHA if ever naa man gani ka diri, panindigi akong kilig. Charot HAHAHAHA ma expire ra sad ni kay out of sight, out of mind.

I've been picking up odd jobs for minimum wage since I'm the primary care giver for the kids while he works full time plus some overtime. 

He is working overtime to help pay down the debt, otherwise we are living paycheck to paycheck.(And just to clarify please know that he is doing the overtime only once or twice a month). 

I was unaware of the debt which is why I'm being so picky about this. I have taken over monitoring the account and scrutinizing every dollar spent. 

Originally he told me he would stop buying coffee on the way to work and he started making it at home and taking a travel mug. He stopped doing that and said he'd like a pot for his desk at work. Well he is still buying coffee on the way to work and it's pissing me off.  

I don't go treating myself to coffee, or anything, ever. I understand he works hard and I would love for him to be able to treat himself but it's coming across very entitled to me that he can't make the small sacrifice of having coffee from home like I do. 

We agreed to budget his daily coffee into our monthly expenses but honestly it's causing resentment on my end. It's not about the coffee. It's about his lack of effort to reduce our debt. 

I quit my career to stay home with the kids because we had zero child care and all the while we were falling into debt that was kept secret from me.

I told my parents this and they told me I’m wrong. How can I be wrong about my actual lived experience? 

But, my symptoms makes sense because my body already makes too much adrenaline, and when I drink coffee, it stimulates adrenaline production even more. Therefore, worsening my symptoms like fatigue, shortness of breath, and heart rate. 

My mom gets so mad at me for drinking it after 12pm because she says it will make me stay up when it actually does the complete opposite for me.

There are large sedimentary deposits in the water, so just boiling it was not enough for us, especially since we need to make formula for baby and a lot of places are selling out of water. I’m doing the following, hope this helps anyone!

1. Boil water from tap (cold tap water only)
2. Bring to rolling boil and let it roll for 1-2 minutes
3. Run boiled water through a coffee filter to remove any sediment chunks
4. Store in a separate clean container labeled boiled and filtered",12,1740005763.0,Hoboken,11,0.88,False
