Not only do they add warmth and comfort to your living spaces, but they also trap dust, dirt, allergens, and bacteria. Regular carpet cleaning is crucial for keeping your home fresh, but sometimes, vacuuming just isn't enough. That’s where professional NYC carpet cleaners come into play. Let’s explore why you should trust the experts for a spotless carpet.

# 1. Deep Cleaning for a Healthier Home

Vacuuming helps remove surface dirt, but professional carpet cleaning goes much deeper. Over time, dirt, dust, and allergens get trapped deep within the fibers, which can affect indoor air quality. NYC carpet cleaners use advanced equipment and techniques to thoroughly clean and sanitize your carpets. This ensures that harmful allergens and bacteria are eliminated, providing a healthier living environment for you and your family.

# 2. Improves the Lifespan of Your Carpet

Carpets are a significant investment in your home, so it's important to maintain them properly. Professional cleaning removes dirt and grime that can wear down carpet fibers, prolonging their lifespan. By choosing expert cleaners in NYC, you're protecting your investment and ensuring that your carpets stay beautiful for years to come.

# 3. Removes Stubborn Stains

One of the biggest challenges of carpet cleaning is removing tough stains. Whether it's spilled coffee, wine, or pet accidents, these stains can leave lasting marks on your carpet. Professional NYC carpet cleaners have the tools and expertise to tackle even the toughest stains, restoring your carpets to their original state. They use safe, effective methods to break down stains and restore your carpet’s appearance.

# 4. Time-Saving and Convenient

Carpet cleaning can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Attempting to clean your carpets yourself often requires multiple cleaning products, a lot of effort, and time. Professional cleaners handle everything for you, saving you the hassle. They work quickly and efficiently, ensuring your carpets are spotless in no time, so you can focus on what matters most.

# 5. Enhanced Aesthetics

A clean carpet can completely transform the look of your home. Professional NYC carpet cleaners use state-of-the-art equipment that ensures your carpets are fresh, vibrant, and free of dirt and stains. Your home will feel more inviting, and your carpets will look as good as new.

In conclusion, opting for professional NYC carpet cleaners is an investment in the cleanliness and longevity of your carpets. Not only will they keep your home looking great, but they’ll also ensure a healthier environment for your family.

So i had to turn right to get my car parked towards holy angel hospital, so as I was supposed to turn a auto rickshaw came wrong side and nearly hit my car. By god grace it didn't happen i got infuriated and got out of my car and said are you drunk , andha hai kya.

# The Content Creation Struggle That's Killing Your Blog Dreams

# The WordPress Writer's Block Nightmare

You know that feeling when you sit down at your computer, coffee in hand, ready to write that perfect blog post that's going to change everything? Then you stare at the blank WordPress editor for what feels like hours. The cursor blinks mockingly. Your mind goes completely empty.

I've been there. We've all been there.

The worst part is watching your competitors pump out daily content while you're still wrestling with paragraph three of a post you started last week. Every day you don't publish is another day your blog sits in digital silence while others build their audience.

The pressure to maintain consistent posting schedules can feel crushing. You tell yourself you'll post three times a week, then it becomes twice, then weekly, then whenever you can manage. Your readers start forgetting you exist. Google starts forgetting you exist.

# The Affiliate Marketing Content Trap

If you're in affiliate marketing, the content struggle hits different. You spend weeks crafting detailed product reviews, researching every angle, trying to balance helpfulness with conversion optimization. You finally hit publish, then wait. And wait. And wait.

Weeks go by with zero rankings. Zero traffic. Zero commissions.

Meanwhile, you're manually hunting for images, wrestling with affiliate link placement across different networks, and trying to figure out compliance requirements. Each post takes forever, costs you hours, and might never see the light of day in search results.

# The SEO Content Bottleneck

Speaking of search rankings, let's talk about the SEO nightmare that keeps most bloggers stuck. Keyword research becomes this endless rabbit hole of analysis paralysis. Which keywords? What search volume? How competitive is too competitive?

You finally pick keywords, write your content, then realize you have no clue about technical SEO optimization. Meta descriptions, schema markup, internal linking strategies - it all feels like rocket science when you just wanted to share your thoughts with the world.

Months pass. Your organic traffic stays flatlined. Your dreams of passive income feel more like a cruel joke.

# The Outsourcing Money Drain

Maybe you tried hiring help. I get it. You found writers on Upwork or Fiverr, thinking you could finally scale your content production. Then reality hits.

The first draft comes back and it's clearly written by someone who doesn't understand your niche. The second writer charges premium prices but delivers content that reads like it was translated through three different languages. The third one disappears halfway through your project.

You end up spending more time editing and revising than if you'd written everything yourself. Your budget hemorrhages money faster than you can say ""content marketing."" The quality control headaches make you wonder why you didn't just stick to writing everything personally.

But here's the thing - there's a better way. And I found it completely by accident.

# Meet AI Content Sniper: Your WordPress Automation Game-Changer

# The Birth of Hands-Free Content Creation

The story behind AI Content Sniper started with two guys who were completely burned out on traditional content creation. Anthony Rousek and Mark Wightley had spent 15 years online, grinding through the same content struggles every blogger faces.

Anthony was this close to walking away from internet marketing entirely. His ad accounts kept getting suspended, his blogs weren't getting traffic, and he was spending more on freelancers and tools than he was making. Sound familiar?

Then something weird happened. While trying to fix a broken campaign, Anthony stumbled on an old organic content approach he hadn't tried in years. No ads, no video, no social media hustle. Just a different way to get seen online.

He didn't expect much, but a few days later, his content ranked. Clicks started flowing. Sales rolled in. All without touching paid ads or writing a single word himself.

# The Accidental Discovery That Changed Everything

That accidental success wasn't just luck - it revealed something huge. With the right approach and tools, you could build, publish, and monetize content on complete autopilot, even with zero ad budget.

Anthony reverse-engineered what worked and teamed up with Mark to create something totally different. Not another AI writing assistant you had to copy and paste from. Not another external platform with monthly limits. A WordPress-native solution that handles everything from content creation to publication to SEO optimization.

They called it AI Content Sniper, and it now generates $3,997.40+ per week in passive income for Anthony's blogs.

# Beyond Traditional Content Tools

Here's what makes AI Content Sniper different from every other AI writing tool out there. Most AI assistants make you work in their interface, then copy and paste content into WordPress. You're juggling multiple tabs, losing formatting, and still doing manual work.

AI Content Sniper lives inside your WordPress dashboard. You never leave your site. The AI generates content directly in your editor, whether you're using the Classic Editor or Elementor. No copying, no pasting, no formatting headaches.

But content generation is just the beginning. This plugin handles image sourcing, affiliate link integration, SEO optimization, and publication scheduling. It's not just writing assistance - it's a complete content automation system.

# The All-in-One Approach That Actually Works

Most bloggers end up with a tech stack that looks like digital chaos. One tool for writing, another for keyword research, a third for images, a fourth for affiliate links, a fifth for SEO analysis. Monthly subscriptions pile up, workflows get complicated, and nothing talks to each other properly.

AI Content Sniper puts everything under one roof. Content generation meets SEO optimization meets affiliate integration meets image sourcing. Built specifically for affiliate marketers and bloggers who want results without the overwhelm.

The creators understand the affiliate marketing game because they live it. They know you need ClickBank integration, MaxWeb compatibility, BuyGoods support. They know you need compliance tools, disclaimer automation, and sales tracking. They built all of that into the core plugin.

# Core Features That Make AI Content Sniper Stand Out

# Multi-AI Engine Flexibility

One of the smartest decisions the developers made was not locking users into a single AI engine. AI Content Sniper integrates with ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude, giving you options based on your content needs and preferences.

Different AI engines excel at different content types. ChatGPT might be perfect for conversational blog posts, while Claude could be better for technical reviews. Gemini might nail that perfect product comparison. You get to choose the right tool for each job.

This flexibility also protects you from platform dependence. If one AI service goes down or changes their pricing, you've got alternatives already built in. Smart planning for long-term content production.

# One-Click Content Generation

The magic happens when you see how fast this actually works. You enter a topic, maybe add a brief outline if you want, select your AI engine, and hit generate. Within 60 seconds, you have a complete blog post ready for review.

We're talking full articles with proper structure, engaging introductions, detailed body content, and compelling conclusions. Not just scattered paragraphs you have to stitch together. Actual publish-ready content.

The headline generation feature deserves special mention. Getting compelling, keyword-optimized titles is an art form that takes most bloggers years to master. AI Content Sniper handles this automatically, giving you multiple title options for each piece of content.

For longer content, the outline building feature is brilliant. You can generate comprehensive article structures before diving into full content creation. This helps maintain focus and ensures your content covers all the important points your readers want to know.

# Visual Content Integration

Content without images is like a restaurant without atmosphere - technically functional but missing something essential. AI Content Sniper automatically sources images from Pixabay, Pexels, and OpenAI to complement your written content.

The plugin doesn't just dump random stock photos into your posts. It analyzes your content and selects relevant, high-quality images that enhance your message. The automated image placement and optimization ensures your posts look professional without manual design work.

This visual integration extends to OpenAI's image generation capabilities. You can create custom images that don't exist anywhere else, giving your content a unique visual identity that stands out from the generic stock photo crowd.

# Affiliate Marketing Automation

This is where AI Content Sniper really shines for anyone monetizing their blog. The plugin integrates directly with major affiliate networks including ClickBank, MaxWeb, and BuyGoods. No more manually hunting for affiliate links or worrying about proper formatting.

The compliance tools handle disclosure requirements automatically. You don't have to remember FTC guidelines or worry about missing required disclaimers. The plugin adds appropriate legal language based on your content type and affiliate relationships.

The sales notification system is particularly clever. You get WordPress notifications when your affiliate links generate commissions, so you can track performance without logging into multiple affiliate dashboards. Everything stays centralized in your WordPress admin area.

# SEO Optimization Built-In

Technical SEO stops being scary when it's handled automatically. AI Content Sniper pulls keyword data directly from Google and Bing, optimizes your meta descriptions, handles internal linking suggestions, and ensures your content follows SEO best practices.

The Google Search Console and Webmaster Tools compatibility means your content gets submitted for indexing automatically. No more manually submitting URLs or wondering if search engines found your latest post.

The bulk publishing capabilities are perfect for scaling content production. You can generate multiple posts, schedule them for publication over time, and let the system handle the entire workflow while you focus on strategy and growth.

# Who Benefits Most From AI Content Sniper

# Complete Beginners to Blogging

If you've never built a blog before, the step-by-step training included with AI Content Sniper walks you through everything. You don't need technical knowledge or years of writing experience. The plugin handles the complexity while you learn the fundamentals.

The training covers niche selection, keyword research basics, content planning, and monetization strategies. You're not just getting a tool - you're getting a complete education in profitable blogging.

# Niche Site Builders

Building authority sites across multiple niches becomes feasible when content creation isn't a bottleneck. You can launch new niche sites, populate them with relevant content, and start building search engine authority quickly.

The evergreen content focus means your automated posts continue generating traffic and commissions long after publication. You're building passive income assets, not just filling content calendars.

# Profit Generation Strategies With AI Content Sniper

# The Organic Traffic Multiplication Method

The real money in content marketing comes from organic search traffic that converts over time. AI Content Sniper helps you build search engine authority through consistent, high-quality content publication.

The plugin's focus on long-tail keyword targeting means faster rankings for specific phrases. Instead of competing for impossible terms, you can dominate smaller niches and build authority from the ground up.

The compound effect is powerful. Each piece of content becomes a potential traffic magnet. Over time, your site becomes a search engine authority that attracts visitors across hundreds or thousands of different keywords.

# Affiliate Commission Automation

Strategic affiliate link placement throughout your content creates multiple monetization opportunities per post. The plugin handles this automatically, ensuring natural integration that doesn't feel pushy or obvious to readers.

The email notification system helps you identify which content types and affiliate products perform best. This data helps optimize future content creation for maximum profitability.

# Passive Income Blog Development

The set-and-forget scheduling capabilities mean you can plan months of content in advance. Your blog continues publishing and earning while you focus on other projects or enjoy actual passive income.

Building evergreen content libraries creates long-term value. These posts continue attracting traffic and generating commissions years after publication, creating true passive income streams.

# Client Service Revenue Streams

Many users discover they can offer content creation services using AI Content Sniper as their secret weapon. You can deliver high-quality blog content to clients faster and more profitably than traditional writing services.

The white-label opportunities for agencies mean you can build entire service offerings around automated content creation. Your clients get professional results while you maintain healthy profit margins.

# Honest Pros and Cons Assessment

# What AI Content Sniper Excels At

The speed of content creation genuinely impresses. Going from topic idea to published post in 60 seconds isn't marketing hype - it's the actual user experience. This speed advantage compounds over time, enabling content production at previously impossible scales.

The WordPress native integration eliminates workflow friction that plagues other AI writing tools. No copying, pasting, or formatting issues. Content appears directly in your familiar WordPress environment, ready for customization or immediate publication.

The multiple AI engine options provide flexibility other tools lack. Different content types benefit from different AI approaches, and having choices prevents vendor lock-in situations that could disrupt your content strategy.

The built-in affiliate marketing tools address real pain points for monetized blogs. Automated compliance, link placement, and sales tracking save hours of manual work while ensuring professional standards.

# Limitations to Consider

API costs for heavy usage can add up over time. While most users spend only a few dollars monthly, high-volume content creators might see significant API expenses. Planning content budgets becomes necessary for large-scale operations.

The dependency on third-party AI services creates potential vulnerabilities. If OpenAI or Google change their pricing, policies, or availability, it could impact your content creation workflow. The multiple engine support helps mitigate this risk but doesn't eliminate it entirely.

Content quality, while impressive, still requires human oversight for best results. The AI generates solid foundation content, but adding personal insights, experiences, and unique perspectives makes the final product more valuable and authentic.

# Competitive Advantage Analysis

# How It Outperforms Traditional Content Tools

Traditional content creation tools address individual parts of the publishing workflow. You might use one tool for writing, another for images, a third for SEO analysis, and a fourth for affiliate link management. AI Content Sniper consolidates these functions into a single, integrated solution.

The WordPress-specific optimization means the plugin understands the platform's capabilities and limitations. Features work naturally within the WordPress ecosystem instead of feeling like awkward integrations from external services.

# Advantage Over Standalone AI Writers

Standalone AI writing assistants like ChatGPT or Claude require manual content transfer into WordPress, often losing formatting and requiring restructuring. AI Content Sniper generates content directly in your WordPress editor, maintaining formatting and structure automatically.

The built-in SEO and affiliate features distinguish AI Content Sniper from pure writing tools. You get complete content marketing functionality, not just text generation that requires additional tools for optimization and monetization.

# Market Position Against Premium Alternatives

Enterprise content marketing solutions often cost hundreds or thousands monthly while requiring technical expertise to implement effectively. AI Content Sniper delivers professional results at a fraction of the cost with a user-friendly interface.

The beginner-friendly approach doesn't sacrifice functionality. Experienced marketers get the advanced features they need while newcomers can start immediately without overwhelming technical requirements.

# Current Pricing and Launch Details

# Limited-Time Launch Pricing

The introductory price of $17.97 represents exceptional value that won't last long. The pricing escalates every 60 minutes during the launch window, moving to $47, then $97, and eventually to a subscription-only model.

This timer-based pricing strategy creates urgency while rewarding early adopters with significant savings. The final subscription pricing will likely cost more monthly than the current one-time fee, making immediate action financially beneficial.

# Launch Window Opportunity

The official launch runs from July 21-26, 2025, with contest prizes and affiliate bonuses adding extra incentive for quick action. The $2,000 prize pool creates excitement and community engagement around the launch.

After the launch window closes, the introductory pricing disappears permanently. Future buyers will pay significantly more for the same functionality, making current timing particularly advantageous.

# Platform Compatibility and Access Methods

# WordPress Requirements

AI Content Sniper works with both Classic Editor and Elementor, covering the vast majority of WordPress users. The plugin integrates seamlessly with popular page builders including Thrive, Divi, and OptimizePress.

The WordPress-native approach ensures compatibility with existing themes and plugins. Users don't have to worry about conflicts or functionality issues that plague some third-party integrations.

# API and Third-Party Dependencies

The plugin connects with OpenAI, Google, and Bing for AI generation and keyword data. These integrations require API keys from the respective services, but setup instructions make the process straightforward for non-technical users.

Image service partnerships with Pixabay, Pexels, and OpenAI provide extensive visual content options. The automated image selection and placement features work without additional user accounts or subscriptions.

# Bonus Package Value Breakdown

# Five Fast-Action Bonuses Detailed

The Bulk Post Creation Plugin (valued at $17.97) enables batch content generation for users who need to populate new sites quickly or maintain aggressive publishing schedules.

The Simple Checklist (valued at $49.95) provides a step-by-step roadmap for users who prefer structured implementation guidance over exploratory learning.

The AI Content Sniper SEO Keyword Research Plugin (valued at $197) adds professional keyword analysis capabilities normally requiring expensive third-party subscriptions.

The Content Helper Legal Pages Plugin (valued at $297) handles compliance requirements automatically, ensuring proper privacy policies, terms of service, and other legal documentation.

The Sales Notification Plugin (valued at $497) provides real-time commission tracking across ClickBank, BuyGoods, MaxWeb, and MaxBounty, centralizing affiliate performance monitoring.

The Private Facebook Community (valued at $97) offers ongoing peer support and direct access to the development team for questions, strategies, and networking opportunities.

These bonuses aren't afterthoughts or low-value add-ons. They're functional tools that enhance the core plugin's capabilities and provide genuine additional value to users' content marketing efforts.

# Should You Invest in AI Content Sniper?

# Ideal User Profile Assessment

AI Content Sniper makes most sense for WordPress users who struggle with consistent content creation. If you spend hours writing posts or pay freelancers significant amounts for mediocre content, this plugin could revolutionize your workflow.

Affiliate marketers focused on organic traffic will find exceptional value in the built-in monetization features. The automated affiliate link placement and compliance tools alone could justify the investment for serious affiliate bloggers.

Bloggers who struggle with publishing consistency will appreciate the speed and automation features. If you currently publish sporadically due to time constraints or writer's block, AI Content Sniper could enable the regular publishing schedule your audience craves.

# When This Tool Makes Sense

Time constraints limiting content creation represent the primary use case for AI Content Sniper. If you have knowledge to share but lack time to write regularly, automation becomes incredibly valuable.

Budget considerations make the plugin attractive compared to outsourcing costs. The one-time fee quickly pays for itself compared to ongoing freelance writing expenses, while providing better control over content quality and timing.

Growth goals requiring content scaling push many users toward automation solutions. Building authority sites, launching multiple niche blogs, or serving agency clients often demands content production beyond manual capabilities.

# Red Flags to Consider

Limited WordPress experience could create setup challenges, though the included training addresses most beginner concerns. Users completely new to WordPress might benefit from basic platform familiarity before implementing advanced automation tools.

Minimal budget for API usage could limit content production for users planning extensive automation. While API costs are typically modest, high-volume creators should factor these ongoing expenses into their budget planning.

# Final Verdict and Recommendation

# Overall Value Proposition

AI Content Sniper delivers exceptional value for WordPress users serious about content marketing. The combination of content automation, SEO optimization, and affiliate marketing tools addresses real pain points that cost significant time and money to solve individually.

The cost-benefit analysis strongly favors plugin adoption for most target users. The time savings alone typically justify the investment within the first month of use, while the improved content consistency and SEO benefits compound over time.

# Long-Term Potential for Passive Income Generation

The plugin's focus on evergreen content creation and search engine optimization builds genuine passive income potential. Posts created today continue attracting traffic and generating commissions months or years later, creating cumulative value that extends far beyond the initial investment.

The affiliate marketing integration and sales tracking features help users identify and replicate successful monetization strategies across their content libraries, optimizing income generation over time.

# Implementation Timeline Expectations

Realistic results begin appearing within the first week for most users. Content creation speed improves immediately, while search engine rankings and traffic growth develop over 30-90 days depending on competition and niche selection.

Success factors include consistent publishing, proper keyword targeting, and strategic affiliate link placement - all areas where AI Content Sniper provides automated assistance and guidance.

The learning curve is minimal for WordPress users, with most people creating quality content within their first session. The included training and documentation help users maximize results quickly without extensive trial and error.

I couldn't control it. I told you that happened and you said you were doing the same thing before going into meet up with your family. You told me you bawled your eyes out before going in the stadium. 

I went and got him a Gatorade and you a breakfast sandwich from Safeway thay you loved and a coffee along with a redbull. I saw the time stamp on when I texted you that I had to pull off to release myself. Then I checked your Snap and you were all pumped that your brother pulled up the UFC fights on his phone within minutes of my dropping you off. 

I mean, you texted me at that time you were barely walking in then because you had to regain your composure. That was a lie. You never cried a single tear. In fact at the time you said you were wiping your tears and heading in at that exact same time you were talking about how the 3 round fight called by a decision might be fight of the night. So you watched the whole thing with them, you admittedly stated in your Snap story while I was actually breaking down in the parking lot. 

You were all laughter and cheers for both your nephew and the fights. You only say that you cry and that you're breaking down to excuse your partner's emotional despairities. This is sad that you lie about such serious emotional stressors so you do not have to ever address the messes you make. That's pretty fuggin low Mak. 

I don't believe you ever really cry over shit when you're separated from your source. And it makes me question when you lose your shit in front of me if that is just an act as well. But, it is what it is. At the very minimum I at least know I'm real and that you are truly disingenuous. Which saddens me as well.",1,1753092056.0,UnsentLettersRaw,1,1.0,False

I’m a woman in my 20s living in Haarlem for a year now, and lately I’ve been really feeling the need to build a social circle - people I can grab coffee with, go to parks, talk about life, share hobbies, explore arts and crafts or just exist around comfortably. 

Ideally I’d love to connect with other women around my age who are down for cozy hangouts and real conversations. I’m not really into heavy partying or big nights out, more the type to do spontaneous picnics, or chat over tea about everything and nothing. 

I’ve realized how much I miss having girlfriends around - the warmth, the laughter, the shared softness. If that resonates with you too, feel free to DM or comment. Maybe we could make a little group and see how things go 🫶🏻

1m5eudl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m5eudl/aio_am_i_being_naive_here_did_i_miss_the_obvious/,AIO? Am I being naive here? Did I miss the obvious?,"I didn’t know where else to put this. I’m new to reddit and this is my first post but I was thinking I could use some advice from strangers on the internet. :)

So I (32F) recently reconnected with a friend (33M) I hadn’t seen or spoken to in years. I’d been thinking about said friend for a little while wondering how I could reconnect with him and the best way to do it, and something told me to un-pause my hinge (I don’t know why because I’m not looking for a relationship. Super happy being single.) Anyway, within 24 hours, look who sent me a like, my friend! 

We talked and quickly arranged a catch up, which was super exciting. I’d actually missed the guy a lot. I don’t have a lot of friends so it felt nice to have someone in my life again. Our first catch up was super great and I didn’t think anything of it, and we quickly arranged a second catch up.

It started to come to my attention on the second meet up that perhaps  it wasn’t just a friendly catch up but I thought I was being silly. He kept using the word date but never out right said we were on a date so I assumed he was messing around - we have a very jokey/teasing relationship.

I think I should add, when I last saw him, he was married so he’s always felt like just a friend. I didn’t think it would be any different now he’s single.

Eventually he confirmed that it was indeed a date, they both were.

I was surprised, I feel like an oblivious idiot. I have never dated really or had a boyfriend so it’s all new to me but I feel really confused as to why after 5 years I would catch up with a friend it would be considered a date right away just because we reconnected on a dating website? I just thought the universe had us reconnect in a fun way. Was it obvious and a given that it was a date and I just missed it? At no point was it expressly said though “I want to take you on a date.” “I’m interested in you.”

I’m aware I can be a bit naive about this stuff, I never assume any guy would have any interest in me, so that might be where I’m going wrong. This current friend, was a safe space, I didn’t feel like I had to worry about that, why would he make a move on me? We’re just friends. So when he said they were actually dates, it completely took that away. What expectations would he have? I’m touch averse, I don’t like being touched at all, it repulses me so those expectations scare me.

I had to take a couple days to think about it and what I wanted to say and he was fine with that but now it feels complicated. I said I wasn’t not interested and would like to reconnect as friends and see where it goes. I need friendship before I can form a relationship anyway. I think a part of me was worried that if I said a straight no, he’d not bother with me anymore. Like if he couldn’t date me, I wasn’t worth the time or effort.

He said it’s fine if I’m not interested and he’s been polite but I just worry it will ruin a friendship that matters to me, I don’t want to make things complicated. I already feel like it’s ruined it a bit, because he doesn’t seem as interested to talk, I’m carrying the convo, I’m messaging first. I already struggle with texting as it is but I’ve really been making an effort. I’m putting in all the work, it’s hard and I’m tired.

I made plans for us to catch up again and it came to the day before and he hadn’t mentioned it so I had to double check we were still doing it. We caught up for coffee, and it felt sooooo different to the first two catch ups. I was tired but I was happy to spend time with regardless but he was like a different dude. Like if the third catch up had been a date with anyone, I wouldn’t have gone back for another. I’m vegan and he knows it but he started talking about his beaver skin hats and it made me uncomfortable. I made a joke about how my sister updated me on our dog’s poop and how it had been a big solid good poop (I mean yay for a good poops, am I right?!) He acted so disgusted and made me feel like I’d just shit in front of him. He lives with a dog too so I don’t know he’d be like that. 

It hit the hour mark and he kept checking his phone which gave me the impression he didn’t want to be there so I did tell him if he had other stuff he needed to do that was fine, I wasn’t forcing him to stay but he said no and it was fine but twenty minutes later he proceeded to say he had errands to run and he had to go. It so abrupt, he didn’t even give me chance to get up, just a random half hug with my face in his armpit. I was left sitting there, wandering wtf had just happened. I don’t drive either so I had to wait over an hour for a ride, just feeling like shit, like I wasn’t worth even an hour and a half of someone’s time.

I text him later and asked if he was ok or if I’d done something wrong but he just said his social battery was dead and that’s why he left. SO this felt even more hurtful because he could’ve just told me the truth and I would have been absolutely fine with it. Also I knew he’d spent the morning before me, with his friends and then was going to hang out with his friends after me too.

I just don’t feel it should be this hard or make me feel this shit afterwards if it’s friendship or something more.",1,1753092029.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and suitability of brass furniture legs depend on several crucial features. These include material composition, finish durability, weight capacity, mounting options, and overall design. Understanding these elements will enable you to select the best legs for your specific project needs.

**Material Composition**

The base material of brass furniture legs is critical for durability and stability. Solid brass offers the highest quality, providing exceptional strength and longevity. Though, it can be more expensive. Brass-plated steel or other metals offer a more affordable option while still providing a brass aesthetic. Confirm the material composition to ensure it meets your needs for both appearance and structural integrity.

The type of brass alloy used can also affect the color and tarnish resistance. Some alloys are more prone to developing a patina over time, offering a vintage look, while others maintain a luminous, polished shine with minimal maintenance. Consider the aesthetic you desire and select a material and alloy accordingly.

**Finish Durability**

The finish of brass furniture legs impacts not only their appearance but also their resistance to scratches, corrosion, and general wear. A high-quality finish should withstand daily use without easily tarnishing or fading. Look for finishes that are lacquered or powder-coated to provide an extra layer of protection.

Electroplating is another common method used to apply brass finish to the legs. This involves using electricity to deposit a thin layer of brass onto the legs. This method provides a consistent and uniform finish with excellent adhesion and is less prone to chipping or peeling.

**Weight Capacity**

The weight capacity of furniture legs is a critical safety consideration.Ensure the legs you choose are rated to support the intended weight of the furniture piece, including any items placed on it. Exceeding the weight capacity can lead to instability, damage, or even failure, posing a safety risk.Always check the manufacturer's specifications for weight capacity. When in doubt, opt for legs with a higher weight rating than you anticipate needing. Distributing the weight evenly across all legs will also contribute to stability and prevent overloading individual legs.

**Mounting Options**

Brass furniture legs typically come with various mounting options to accommodate different furniture designs and attachment methods. The most common options include pre-drilled mounting plates,threaded inserts,and levelers.Consider the type of furniture you are attaching the legs to and choose a mounting option that provides a secure and stable connection.

Pre-drilled mounting plates allow for easy attachment using screws. Threaded inserts are ideal for furniture with existing threaded holes or for creating a more secure connection. Levelers allow you to adjust the height of each leg to compensate for uneven floors.

**Overall Design**

Brass furniture legs come in a wide variety of designs, ranging from sleek and modern to ornate and customary.The design of the legs should complement the style of the furniture piece and the overall aesthetic of the room. Consider the shape, size, and detailing of the legs to ensure they enhance the visual appeal of the furniture.

Some popular designs include tapered legs, straight legs, hairpin legs, and cabriole legs. Tapered legs offer a graceful and refined look, while straight legs provide a more minimalist and contemporary feel. hairpin legs add a retro touch, and cabriole legs bring a touch of elegance and sophistication.

## Core Benefits

Brass furniture legs offer several practical benefits, including aesthetic enhancement, increased stability, and protection for flooring. These features contribute to both the visual appeal and functionality of the furniture.

**Aesthetic Enhancement**

Brass legs instantly elevate the look of furniture. The warm, metallic tones of brass add a touch of luxury and sophistication to any piece, whether it's a sofa, coffee table, or cabinet. They create a polished and refined appearance that complements a variety of interior design styles, from mid-century modern to contemporary.

The versatility of brass allows it to blend seamlessly with different color palettes and materials. It pairs well with natural woods, rich fabrics, and even industrial-inspired elements.This makes it a versatile choice for enhancing the overall aesthetic of your furniture and room.

**Increased Stability**

Replacing flimsy,unstable legs with sturdy brass legs can significantly improve the stability of furniture. Brass is a strong and durable material that provides a solid foundation, preventing wobbling and tipping. This is particularly vital for furniture that is frequently used or that supports heavy items.

Properly installed brass legs can distribute weight evenly and provide a more secure base. This reduces the risk of accidents and ensures that your furniture remains stable and safe for everyday use. The added stability also extends the lifespan of the furniture by preventing undue stress on the frame and joints.

**Protection for Flooring**

brass furniture legs often come with protective feet or glides that prevent scratches and scuff marks on flooring. these protective elements are typically made of rubber, felt, or plastic and are designed to minimize friction between the legs and the floor. This is particularly important for delicate surfaces such as hardwood, tile, or laminate.

The protective feet not only prevent damage but also reduce noise when moving furniture. This is especially beneficial in homes with hard floors where the sound of furniture being dragged can be amplified. By protecting your floors, brass furniture legs help maintain the overall appearance and value of your home.

## FAQs Section

**Are brass furniture legs suitable for outdoor use?**
While brass furniture legs offer a lovely aesthetic, they are generally better suited for indoor use. Exposure to harsh weather conditions, such as rain, snow, and direct sunlight, can cause tarnishing and corrosion over time. If you intend to use brass legs outdoors,opt for legs specifically designed for outdoor use,which may feature a protective coating or finish.

**How do I clean and maintain brass furniture legs?**
Cleaning and maintaining brass furniture legs is relatively simple. Regularly dust the legs with a soft cloth to remove any surface dirt or debris. For more stubborn stains or tarnish, use a brass cleaner specifically designed for furniture. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and test the cleaner on an inconspicuous area first.

To prevent tarnishing, avoid exposing brass legs to excessive moisture or humidity. Applying a thin coat of furniture polish can also help protect the finish and maintain its shine. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can scratch the surface.

**Can I replace existing furniture legs with brass legs myself?**
Replacing existing furniture legs with brass legs is a straightforward process that most homeowners can complete themselves. Though, success depends on the furniture. The first step is to measure the height and diameter of the existing legs to ensure the new legs are the appropriate size. Next,remove the old legs by unscrewing them or detaching them from their mounting brackets.

Attach the new brass legs using the appropriate mounting hardware. Ensure the legs are securely fastened and evenly spaced. If necessary, use shims or levelers to adjust the height of each leg and compensate for uneven floors.

# best Basket Coffee Filters 2025: Top picks Reviewed

Basket coffee filters are an essential ⁢part of many coffee brewing systems. These filters, which are ⁤designed for flat-bottomed coffee makers, provide a consistent and clean brewing experience. Choosing ‍the⁣ right basket coffee filter can significantly impact⁢ the taste and ⁣quality of your‍ coffee, making it crucial to select a product that meets your specific needs and preferences. This review will examine some of ⁤the best basket coffee filters available in 2025, analyzing their features,​ benefits, and comparing them to⁢ offer a comprehensive guide for coffee enthusiasts.

[[Explore Top Rated basket coffee filter on Amazon.]](https://site.properlygeek.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=basket coffee filter)

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a basket coffee filter is steadfast by several factors, including material, mesh size, durability, and ease of use. These features ‍directly influence the efficiency‌ of the filtration process and the overall taste of the‌ brewed coffee.

**Material:** Basket coffee filters are typically made from either paper or metal. paper filters are disposable and offer ​excellent filtration,‍ trapping most oils and sediments.Metal filters, conversely, are reusable and ‍more environmentally friendly, but they may allow​ some fine particles and oils to pass through, resulting in a richer, fuller-bodied coffee.

The choice between paper and metal depends largely⁣ on personal ‍preference. Paper filters provide a cleaner cup‌ with less sediment, while metal filters offer a more robust flavor profile. The source of the paper, such as bleached or unbleached, can also affect taste, with unbleached options often preferred for their neutral flavor.

**Mesh Size ⁤(Metal Filters):** For metal basket ⁣coffee filters,the mesh ⁤size is‌ a critical factor.‍ Finer‍ meshes capture more sediment, similar ​to paper filters, while coarser meshes⁢ allow more solids and oils to pass through. the ideal mesh size depends‍ on⁢ the type of coffee ‌being brewed and the desired flavor profile.

A well-designed metal filter will have consistent mesh spacing to ensure uniform extraction. Higher-quality filters often use precision etching or laser cutting to achieve ‍this consistency. A tightly woven mesh also increases the filter’s durability and prevents premature wear and‍ tear.

**Durability:** A good basket coffee filter should withstand repeated use ⁢without tearing or collapsing,⁣ especially for paper filters. Metal filters should be resistant to rust and corrosion,even ‍after ⁣prolonged ‌exposure‌ to water⁤ and coffee ​grounds.

Paper filters with reinforced edges are‍ less likely to tear during the brewing process. Metal filters made from high-grade stainless steel are more durable and resistant to damage from regular use and cleaning. Regularly cleaning metal filters can​ also prolong their lifespan and maintain optimal performance.

**Ease of Use and Cleaning:** the best basket coffee filters are easy to insert into the coffee maker and simple⁤ to dispose of or clean. Paper filters can be easily discarded after use, while metal filters require rinsing and occasional deep cleaning.Some metal filters feature a smooth, ‍non-stick surface⁢ that makes it easier to remove coffee⁣ grounds. Using a mild ‌detergent ⁢and a soft brush can effectively clean metal​ filters‌ without damaging the mesh. Ensuring the filter is completely dry before ​its next use prevents the buildup of mold and bacteria.

**Improved Coffee Flavor:** The type of filter used directly impacts the taste of the brewed coffee.Paper filters remove more oils and sediment, resulting in a cleaner, brighter flavor, while metal filters allow more of these elements to pass ⁤through, producing a richer,‍ more full-bodied cup. This allows you to​ customize your coffee's profile.

For those‌ who prefer a‍ cleaner, less bitter taste, paper filters are an excellent choice. Alternatively, if you enjoy a more robust and oily flavor,⁢ a metal filter will deliver that experience.Experimenting with different filters can help you‌ find the perfect ‍flavor profile for your preferred coffee beans.

**Convenience:** Basket coffee filters offer a convenient solution for brewing coffee, whether you prefer disposable paper filters or reusable ⁢metal options. Both⁤ types are ⁢easy to use and ​require minimal effort.

Paper filters ‍provide the ultimate⁢ convenience,⁣ as they can be simply discarded after use. Reusable metal filters require rinsing and cleaning, but they eliminate the need to constantly purchase new filters.The choice ‌depends on your lifestyle and preference for convenience versus environmental impact.

**Cost efficiency:** While disposable paper filters require ongoing purchases, reusable metal filters offer a long-term cost-saving solution.​ Over time, the initial investment⁢ in a metal filter pays off by eliminating the need to buy paper filters.

Though paper filters are inexpensive, the cost accumulates over time, especially⁢ for daily coffee drinkers. Investing‌ in a durable metal filter can save money in the long run and reduce waste. The⁤ cost-effectiveness of metal filters makes⁢ them an attractive option for budget-conscious​ coffee enthusiasts.**Environmental Sustainability:** reusable metal ​basket coffee filters are an environmentally friendly alternative ​to disposable ⁢paper filters. By choosing a metal filter, you can reduce your environmental footprint‌ and contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle.

Paper filters contribute to deforestation ​and waste, whereas metal filters can last for years with proper care. Opting for a metal filter is a simple yet effective way to reduce waste and promote sustainability in your daily coffee ‍routine.

1m5er57,https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/1m5er57/to_those_who_left_how_long_did_it_take_for_you_to/,To those who left; How long did it take for you to switch careers? What advice could you offer?,"Throwaway account to keep my personal one personal - I have former colleagues who use reddit and are active in these subs.

**Personal Context:**

(26f) based in the UK. I've been working as a 3D animator within games now for \~4 years, with two released titles under my belt, and I have been job searching now for around 4 months.

My past two gigs have been temporary and I feel like I've been lucky with those. They came from my network rather than through blind applications, I really don't feel like my portfolio is impressive enough to compete within the current market.

**Personal Dilemma:**

I hate contracting/freelancing. I've always been careful with money as I don't come from an affluent background, and so far it's been my only saving grace with all of this. I started hard saving from the moment I noticed the industry turn shaky, before I was made redundant, but I don't think my current way of living is sustainable.

If I include the gaps between jobs, I'm currently working at a deficit. No one can afford workers, so I understand that wages have to be low and that any kind of income is better than none, but I'm struggling to rebuild the savings I put away during my last permanent role.

Before all of this my future was looking bright, a lot of people thought I could go really far. Whilst I don't think my animation skill is currently quite good enough to compete, I've done some impressive stuff on projects.

I get tough stuff done exceptionally fast, but I've been struggling to market that in a way that allows me to compete for senior roles. It's the kind of thing that only people who I've worked closely with appreciate.

**The Switch:**

I really love animation, and have been passionate about it from a very young age. This job is something I've worked towards since I was 12, but with how things have been going for everyone, I've been trying switch industries. I feel like I need to prioritize my own general well being, and instead treat animation as a hobby.

So far I've been kind of treading water on both sides. I'm trying to keep my hand in the games scene as that's where I've got the strongest skills, network, and experience. By this I mean I'm taking part in small projects and applying to roles - even if they seem out of reach.

Outside of that, I've been struggling to figure out how to transition to a different role in a new industry. I feel like I'm in this grey zone, where I'm overqualified for entry roles, and not skilled enough for anything above.

There isn't any one specific job I've been looking at. I've been applying to anything that sounds like it can make use of my skills. Some examples include; Content Producer (Marketing), Admissions Administrator (University), Junior Researcher (Government), Content Designer (Government), Junior Event Rep (Private Company).

I feel like my previous role titles and experience are really holding me back on applications, and there's only so much """"editing"""" I can do to my CV bearing in mind that a new employer will want to check in with my references. I'm open to retraining, but would want to be certain that there's a job at the end.

**The Question:**

So, to those of you who have successfully left the industry;

\- What were you doing before vs. What are you doing now?  
\- How long did it take for you to switch to a new role?  
\- Has it been difficult/ Did you have to study for it?  
\- Did you have support in switching? (i.e moving back with family, friends helping you get the job, etc)  
\- Does your new role align with previous roles on your CV?  
\- Are you based in the UK, or somewhere else? (Only asking as job markets can differ, please only share if you're comfortable)

**All experiences are welcome!**

I'm really just trying to figure out what I need to do here, so please don't hold back! Even if you're working in a family owned coffee shop, talking to a former boss about finding a position for you, or have gone back to University.

Any advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",3,1753091690.0,animationcareer,1,1.0,False

A café opened up nearby. Small, quiet, always empty. I decided to check it out one morning, thinking I’d grab a coffee and chill for a bit.
(Yes, I drink coffee even in this heat.)

Now, the guy running the place?
He looked like an ex-Yakuza or something.

Bald head, cap turned backwards, long beard, tattoos covering his arms. He’s like 6’4” and built like a tank,the kind of guy you wouldn’t expect to talk to unless you absolutely had to.

But when I walked in, he gave me a calm smile and said,
“Morning, brother. What can I get for you today?”

Turns out, this guy wasn’t just some big, scary-looking dude he was actually really polite and friendly. He used to be a rapper (not super famous), but left the scene to start fresh. Now he runs the café and reads a ton of books.
He knows so much about everything.how coffee is made, how rocks are formed , etc...

We talked about books, life, and the deeper meaning behind things, and honestly? I had a great time. His coffee was actually really good.
So I told him I’d spread the word about his café.
He didn’t quite believe me but he appreciated it.

I ended up dragging my whole family there. Then the “uncle” cashier from the supermarket since the café is pretty close to his shop.
And yes, even that ugly girl I went on an arcade date with once.
They all walked in, a little skeptical at first, but within minutes they were hooked on the drinks.
Everyone was surprised at how good the coffee and pastries were.

A few days later, the café owner handed me a free pastry and treated me like I was his younger brother.

That made my whole day.

We recently moved out of our place because I’m moving to a new city for my job. I’ll be 4 hours away, so as of this week, we’re starting long distance.

When we first got together, she warned me that she had an anxious attachment style. I know that takes some work, but I am in principle fine with that. However, I struggle to separate what might be symptoms of anxiety from signs of actual abuse/control/manipulation.

When we’re apart, she texts me every twenty minutes, and I really struggle to be fully present with my friends, family, and colleagues; I instead feel like I have to micromanage how she’s feeling in the background. And when we’re together, I feel like she’s picking constant fights with me over minuscule or nonexistent issues; I bought too much OJ, I forgot to get her a coffee, I didn’t respond to her texts for an hour, my family is inappropriate, my friends are out of line, etc. There’ve been a couple of times she’s antagonised me like this in front of my friends and family too. In short, there’s a new issue every day, and I feel like I’m navigating a minefield just trying to exist in peace.

When I voice how I feel, she uses emotionally ‘healthy’ language (‘boundaries’, ‘attachment styles’, etc.), and says her behaviour stems from her anxious attachment style. She then usually ends up either getting defensive or breaking down crying, leaving me to be the peacemaker and apologise for bringing up how I feel. Most recently, I expressed concern about her idea of moving to my city with me, and she made me feel like a monster for even having that thought. In short, I don’t feel safe expressing how I feel, her needs always come before mine, and I have to bend my entire life to better suit hers. 

In more recent fights, I’ve started to get some space, like going out to see friends or going out for walks for a few hours because it just feels exhausting to deal with this every day. When I do this, she breaks down crying, says I don’t care about how she feels, that I’m an avoidant partner and should seek therapy. 

I love her but this is just too much and I don’t know if it’s worth the effort anymore. I feel like I’m always second-guessing my gut feeling.

What would you do in my situation? Is her behaviour actually a sign of anxiety or is it manipulation (or both)?

I’m new to reddit and this is my first post but I was thinking I could use some advice from strangers on the internet. :)

So I (32F) recently reconnected with a friend (33M) I hadn’t seen or spoken to in years. I’d been thinking about said friend for a little while wondering how I could reconnect with him and the best way to do it, and something told me to un-pause my hinge (I don’t know why because I’m not looking for a relationship. Super happy being single.) Anyway, within 24 hours, look who sent me a like, my friend! 

We talked and quickly arranged a catch up, which was super exciting. I’d actually missed the guy a lot. I don’t have a lot of friends so it felt nice to have someone in my life again. Our first catch up was super great and I didn’t think anything of it, and we quickly arranged a second catch up.

It started to come to my attention on the second meet up that perhaps  it wasn’t just a friendly catch up but I thought I was being silly. He kept using the word date but never out right said we were on a date so I assumed he was messing around - we have a very jokey/teasing relationship.

I think I should add, when I last saw him, he was married so he’s always felt like just a friend. I didn’t think it would be any different now he’s single.

Eventually he confirmed that it was indeed a date, they both were.

I was surprised, I feel like an oblivious idiot. I have never dated really or had a boyfriend so it’s all new to me but I feel really confused as to why after 5 years I would catch up with a friend it would be considered a date right away just because we reconnected on a dating website? I just thought the universe had us reconnect in a fun way. Was it obvious and a given that it was a date and I just missed it? At no point was it expressly said though “I want to take you on a date.” “I’m interested in you.”

I’m aware I can be a bit naive about this stuff, I never assume any guy would have any interest in me, so that might be where I’m going wrong. This current friend, was a safe space, I didn’t feel like I had to worry about that, why would he make a move on me? We’re just friends. So when he said they were actually dates, it completely took that away. What expectations would he have? I’m touch averse, I don’t like being touched at all, it repulses me so those expectations scare me.

I had to take a couple days to think about it and what I wanted to say and he was fine with that but now it feels complicated. I said I wasn’t not interested and would like to reconnect as friends and see where it goes. I need friendship before I can form a relationship anyway. I think a part of me was worried that if I said a straight no, he’d not bother with me anymore. Like if he couldn’t date me, I wasn’t worth the time or effort.

He said it’s fine if I’m not interested and he’s been polite but I just worry it will ruin a friendship that matters to me, I don’t want to make things complicated. I already feel like it’s ruined it a bit, because he doesn’t seem as interested to talk, I’m carrying the convo, I’m messaging first. I already struggle with texting as it is but I’ve really been making an effort. I’m putting in all the work, it’s hard and I’m tired.

I made plans for us to catch up again and it came to the day before and he hadn’t mentioned it so I had to double check we were still doing it. We caught up for coffee, and it felt sooooo different to the first two catch ups. I was tired but I was happy to spend time with regardless but he was like a different dude. Like if the third catch up had been a date with anyone, I wouldn’t have gone back for another. I’m vegan and he knows it but he started talking about his beaver skin hats and it made me uncomfortable. I made a joke about how my sister updated me on our dog’s poop and how it had been a big solid good poop (I mean yay for a good poops, am I right?!) He acted so disgusted and made me feel like I’d just shit in front of him. He lives with a dog too so I don’t know he’d be like that. 

It hit the hour mark and he kept checking his phone which gave me the impression he didn’t want to be there so I did tell him if he had other stuff he needed to do that was fine, I wasn’t forcing him to stay but he said no and it was fine but twenty minutes later he proceeded to say he had errands to run and he had to go. It so abrupt, he didn’t even give me chance to get up, just a random half hug with my face in his armpit. I was left sitting there, wandering wtf had just happened. I don’t drive either so I had to wait over an hour for a ride, just feeling like shit, like I wasn’t worth even an hour and a half of someone’s time.

I text him later and asked if he was ok or if I’d done something wrong but he just said his social battery was dead and that’s why he left. SO this felt even more hurtful because he could’ve just told me the truth and I would have been absolutely fine with it. Also I knew he’d spent the morning before me, with his friends and then was going to hang out with his friends after me too.

I just don’t feel it should be this hard or make me feel this shit afterwards if it’s friendship or something more.",0,1753090837.0,AIO,0,0.5,False

I was an ordinary student with an ordinary life. Fourth year na ako nang makabili ng technical pens na gamit sa drafting. Grumaduate ako nang walang T-square, rolling roller, watercolor pencil, mamahaling laptop. I understand because we're not rich.

2020, pandemic when I started writing for novel paying platforms. I was happy to earn three thousand pesos on my first try. I gave the money to my mother. Sabi ko aanhin ko iyon, e wala naman akong bibilhin. I didn't even think about my drawing paraphernalia. My second earning was around seven thousand, then ten thousand, and so on. I was beyond the cloud.

Wala pa  kaming bahay dahil nasira ng bagyo. Nakikitira lang kami pero dahil sa part-time ko, masasarap ang ulam namin.

Unang gamit na nabili namin sa pera ko ay thermos. I love coffee. I was happy. Then washing machine.

Nakatulong ako sa pagpapagawa ng bahay. It was satisfying kahit mabagal matapos.

Okay naman. Tinuloy-tuloy ko ang pagsusulat kahit minsan nakakatamad. Nakagraduate ako ng college. Then, my life started becoming so hard.

Sumama ako sa kaibigan at kaklase ko sa Bulacan para sa Apprenticeship. One month lang kasi hindi ko kaya. I cried on my first night there. I cried myself to sleep.

Life goes on, lilipas rin iyan.

Nakakapagod. I started feeling exhausted. Physical work sa umaga, mental work sa gabi. I'm still writing.

I can't go on like that. Naoverwhelmed ako sa trabaho. Ganoon pala sa real world. Ganoon pala iyong sinasabi nilang real battlefield pagkalabas ng school. Nakakapagod. Nakakaubos.

Sabi ko uuwi na ako. Pinayagan ako. I earned a hundred thousand pesos from novel writing bago pa ako umuwi. Ninety-five thousand nang makauwi. Seventy thousand nang nasa bahay nalang.

We opened up a sari-sari store. Para may puntahan iyong pagod at puyat ko. My hard-earned money deserved to be an investment.

Okay pa rin sa unang buwan, but then I started questioning my goals, dreams, and destination.

Hanggang saan ba ako? Why can't I see myself becoming an architect or an author?

Nahuhuli na yata ako. At the age of twenty-six, wala akong ipon. Minsan naiisip ko nang ibenta ang konting koleksyon ko ng libro at anime figures. Seven thousand rin iyon.

I tried to find something na paglilibangan. Kapag pagod na sa pagsusulat, I'd play mobile games.

But then, naging pabigat yata ako. I'm still writing pero humihina na. Siguro wala nang saysay ang mga salita ko. Wala nang intelligence at emotion ang akda ko.

Konsumisyon.

Mahina na ang kita kaya wala na rin iyong masayang feeling at excitement tuwing sweldo. Ayaw na rin nilang tumanggap ng ten thousand. Maliit na ang twenty thousand. Wala nang pupuntahan ang thirty thousand.

January before I went to Bulacan, I earned eighty thousand. February, I earned one hundred five thousand. Naubos na ang mga utang. May pang tindahan na. May pang luho na rin. March, I earned ninety-five thousand. April, seventy thousand. Hanggang doon lang pala iyon. Mababa na ang kita kaya mahirap nang magpasaya.

Everytime I was playing, I became an eye sore.

She didn't know I cry at night.

No one knows I thought about hanging myself.

I don't know what to do. I earn monthly. But it feels nothing.

Gusto kong magpakabit ng sariling kuryente pero kulang iyong twenty thousand. Gusto kong magpatiles ng banyo pero wala akong fifty thousand. Gusto kong magpalagay ng glass window pero hindi kaya ng ten thousand.

Ang dami na ulit utang. Paano ako kikita ulit ng one hundred thousand?

Tuloy-tuloy ang pagsusulat kahit nakakapagod na. Konti nalang ang kain kasi walang gana kasi wala ring pera. Nakakapuyat rin palang mangarap sa gabi. Nakakapagod rin pala mag-isip. Ang hirap rin pala na nasa bahay lang.

Sana may life insurance ako. Sana may savings. Sana may hulog ang health insurance. Sana may pera pang gala kahit hanggang Lucena lang. Makapagmall sana. Sana nagtabi ako ng konti.

Gusto ko ng maraming collection ng books at anime figures.

Gusto ko ng bagong cellphone.

Gusto ko ng dress.

Gusto ko ng sapatos.

Gusto ko ng bag.

Gusto ko ng make up.

Gusto kong mabuhay.",1,1753090826.0,LifeRants_,3,1.0,False

So this is a sort of first draft, I guess, I wrote it all in one go, I don't think it's very good, but I'd like to know if I'm crazy or not.

\*\*\*

I think knowing yourself comes with knowing your limits. Things you can’t achieve, no matter how badly you want them. I cannot achieve companionship. I know this about myself. I have learned it, through trial and error. I cannot spend time with another person like that. I cannot be someone’s half because I am already whole; three-quarters, anyway, and no one is half of a half, even if that is all that I need. I drink enough coffee to feel like I might throw up. There is something disjointed, like a loose wire, sitting in my chest. I see the image but I hear no sound, I knock on its side to fix the connection. I don’t know why I only want the vision of someone beside me. I want the idea of a person, the consciousness of an answered text, or an inside joke. I don’t want to stitch a tear or sleep next to anyone. I don’t want to touch them. I always thought I wanted some sort of life partner, a soul mate, a girl to kiss or a boy to look up at. I search and search and take things out to find what I’m looking for and ultimately see nothing. Why can’t I want someone? Why don’t I need someone to want? Why do I want to need someone to want? Why do I want to want to want? Why do I want like I’ve taken my feet off the bicycle’s pedals and I wait for them to slow down? Now, anyway. But now I don’t know what I want anymore.   
  
It’s exceptionally lonely, knowing you don’t want someone, anyone at all, and you can’t force yourself to. I feel like a piece of my chest has been removed, somewhere deep I don’t know about. It feels like a phantom pain. The blistering of a heel the sock has run down on. Knowing this, taking this hypothesis forward - that I want no one, and unfortunately might never change that - I can assume I cannot marry. I could, if I wanted to. But the wanting is the problem. It seems I want all the wrong things, and don’t want all the things I should. I want to burn high and bright, and I want to be alone. I want to speak to myself out loud in cold sheets, and I don’t want to tell someone I love them. I want to be talented. I want to know I’m talented. I don’t want to be told I’m talented. I don’t want to bandage the same calloused wound with another complement, and another, and another. They build up in me and burn like Greek fire in water. I want to be made of nothing, and I want people to want to fill me. I want to empty out anyway. I want people to want to save me but I don’t want to die. I want people to want to save me but I don’t want to be seen as needing to be saved. I want to vomit. I don’t want to vomit in this coffee shop. I want to have a normal conversation. I don’t want to vomit in this coffee shop.   
  
I want to have children. What I \*really\* want is to \*raise\* children, and show them things, and explain things to them: therefore, what I want is to hold someone hostage until I demonstrate all I know and take a long rest after I have proven that I know things. Breaking it down to that is sobering. I want a half-person who is never real, because a real person feels like more than one. I want someone who I don’t see enough to know very well, and I don’t know enough to see through. I want to build someone from the ground up then let them go, because I have enough to build them with, and then maybe I will be empty enough, finally, to see them through. I want to have children, in the abstract. I want to have children, because I want a relationship I control, with people I design, where the rules are made by me and I am all the worse for it. I know I couldn’t have children, though, when I really sit down and think about it, I mean, when I \*really\* sit down and think, what could happen here? For another person to grow? They’d need a father, and I am father and mother enough for everyone. But being father and mother enough for everyone isn’t enough for everyone, that is, being enough can sometimes be too much and you have to spread it all out between different people - that’s what I’m getting at, here, that I am too much something in one package, and that to be less than something is to be a perfect person, so you can hold someone else’s something in your one empty hand - what I’m saying here is that I have only so many hands and so, so many somethings. Too many for children, or for lovers, or for best friends.   
  
My grandmother sat there. She thought, and she waited to die. She lived longer than any relatives I had known before, and I hadn’t known her very well, but I hadn’t known any others, so ostensibly I knew her the best and was the closest with her. I hadn’t known her, and we weren’t close. But I saw in her the same detachment, and the same ice that sank into her bones years ago, holding her still, away. She had children, and she broke them with how much of a person she was. All together. She didn’t have enough hands, and they had to learn to use their own. She sat there until she died, in her chair. Batting around the same fifteen stories over and over again, trapped in an echoing well of her own experiences, doubling, folding, smothering her. She chewed what she had said before over and over again for every meal. I saw my own death in her. I saw my own death: a girl, armored, eating herself to keep from being hungry, forgetting to mourn. Not needing to. Too stuffed. 

The only time I saw her breathe was when I told her something she didn’t already know: then, she’d sit there, face open, voice lilting, curious. To know more. Then she was a person with a hand free and grasping. Rare. Human. I did not cry when she died. I am still eating parts of her. They’re still coming back up.

I was fed a lie as a teen that they only work for adhd. Similar to how “coffee makes adhd people calm” and how it doesn’t for “normal people” only to figure out it’s called addiction/dependency and everyone who drinks coffe will become calm drinking it.    


I have adhd meds and my friend who struggles with depression told me she used to take them when she was depressed and they did wonders for her. She could get out of bed, do her chores, etc. And now I know that yeah, adhd meds work for everyone who reacts positively to it. Obviously some people handle stimulants less good but it’s not adhd vs non adhd as there are plenty of normal people who do fine on stims and plenty of people with adhd who do bad on stims.     


So my question is. Are we ethically just deciding to keep methylphenidate as “an adhd medication” when it might be an alternative for other syndroms/conditions. I understand there’s a risk here of dependency, organ damage, efficacy fading. But I can barely find any studies of using stims for depression but those thst did report good results.

1m5e8go,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1m5e8go/we_broke_up/,We broke up 💔,"This is going to be a long one I’m afraid, but I wanted to share what I’m currently going through. It’s so rough and if anyone has any advice or words of encouragement I’d be really grateful. All I ask is pls be kind, I’m only two days in and I’m not in a good place.

This month has been the worst one I’ve had in a while. At the end of June, we went to Croatia together and had a wonderful time - we went to the beaches, went kayaking, cave exploring, and ate so much calamari. We took film cameras as well to capture it all and so it would look nostalgic.

I just want to quickly mention (because I think it’s important) this was his first relationship. He’s 25 and I’m 27, and this was my 3rd.

We had been officially together for 6 months and - whilst it takes me a really long time to fall in love - I wanted to tell him that I do love and care for him. So I did, and he said it back. We were sat in a piazza having some ice cream coffee. We both expressed how happy we were and how we’ve done so well so far with the long distance. I truly felt like everything in my life was aligning well. 

 But two days after we got home to our own cities (Glasgow and London) he FaceTimed me to say that he realised he isn’t in love with me - and I wasn’t hurt by this, I knew he probably wouldn’t be at this stage and I know I wasn’t there either. But he said because he doesn’t have that deep feeling, we should end it. I was so shocked. I asked him to slow down with his decision making because it was very abrupt and I felt like it was more of a reaction out of fear than anything else. His sister had also advised him to slow down. He was going to his family home in Sweden the following week so we he said he’d take that time to think about it and clear his head. I went down to my family home to be with my mum during this time because I didn’t want to be alone.

The last couple of weeks have been horrible. I literally had no relief from the stress and worry. The feeling of being in limbo was exhausting. I assumed the worst and tried my best to prepare for it - but ofc, no matter how much you pre-grieve, it doesn’t soften the blow when it comes. 

In all honesty, I had really hoped that if he decided he wanted to end things, he’d have called me sooner to rip off the bandaid. I really thought he would, and by the time we called to catch up, even tho I was thinking it could go either way, I still had hope that we’d continue our relationship.

But he told me he doesn’t think he’s ready to love yet or to be in a relationship. I understand this, even tho it sucks so fucking bad. I knew when we got together that there would be things he hasn’t experienced with this being his first relationship, but I truly, truly believed in us. It’s the fact that we never had a bad time together - neither of us did anything wrong. I have to grieve and move on from someone who wasn’t just my bf but one of my best friends. He said he felt the same way about me, and how he wished it could be different and that losing us is going to hurt so bad - he just never wanted to hurt me with his uncertainty. In time, after we’ve taken our time to heal (and I mean plenty of time) we both wanna be friends and we agreed that our last call would not be the last time we speak. 

I’m honestly devastated. This is day 2 of the official breakup and I’m exhausted. For some reason the mornings and late afternoons hit the absolute worst. Nighttime is strangely peaceful, even tho that’s when we would have our nightly call. 

This was truly the happiest and healthiest relationship I’ve ever had. I never once felt like I was too much or that I had to change anything about myself. He honestly taught me what true love is meant to feel like, and he helped to reveal me. He told me that since being with me his family has noticed so many positive changes. He told me I helped to shape him. Which is so special and I’ll remember that when it gets hard. 

Even tho we ended on great terms and what we had was so real and precious, the fact that we won’t be calling every night and playing games and watching movies together, or organising more trips…I won’t be going to his flat in London anymore…I get strong place attachment and I keep thinking about the places we explored together in London. I saw myself eventually moving down there to close the gap. He’s the first person I actually enjoyed cooking with, we worked so well as a team. I wish I’d told him that on our last call - I told him so much about what I was grateful for but I forgot to mention that. I’m so grateful to have had him. But fuck, I miss him. I’ve lost so much weight these last few weeks and I just realised I didn’t eat anything yesterday. I can’t even process our time in Croatia because it hurts so much ",6,1753089726.0,LongDistance,2,1.0,False

It’s Monday, I haven’t slept properly in days, and my coffee isn’t doing what it promised. So I’m putting this out into the universe (or Reddit): if you’re cute, chatty, and slightly unhinged in a fun way… we might just get along 😌

Had some weekend plans fall through, so now I’ve got some unexpected free time and a strong desire to not spend it alone. Looking for someone to flirt with, banter with, maybe VC if we click — or even do a movie night where we both pretend we’re paying attention to the film, and not each other.

About me:

* **25M**, London-based, work in **finance** (but don’t worry, I won’t talk about work unless you’re into spreadsheets and chaos)
* Love **movies**, **football**, **F1**, **reading**, **photography**, and eating my way through the city
* Learning to cook. Results range from “wow marry me” to “we don’t talk about that night”
* Certified yapper™, so if you've got a weird obsession, niche interest, or sexy brain takes, I want to hear *all* about it

Basically just here looking for some fun, some connection, and maybe a reason to stop refreshing my emails every 10 minutes.

1m5e7rd,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m5e7rd/he_lives_amongst_you/,He lives amongst you,"A shadow was cast over us. A silent shriek that haunted history since we first took breath. While our ancestors feared the predators luring in the dark, they missed the monster hiding amongst them. He has no origin. He has no soul to call his own. His only reason to persevere is to feast on our suffering. Or so I was told.

Throughout the recorded history only a few noticed his presence. I would have never learned of this foul beast if it hadn’t been for my father, who taught me once I was old enough. A family secret passed down the generations, bound to an oath to avenge the fallen. I wish my father would have taken the truth to the grave.

At first, I believed him to be mad; the beast was nothing but a ghost of his tormented mind. But the evidence he showed me convinced me of the opposite. In many human catastrophes, countless bloodbaths, or killings of innocence, he had his hands in. From the dawn of our species to now.

The writings my father revealed to me seemed a crude joke at first. But the more he amassed on me, the more my mind struggled to deny the truth. Once I saw the pictures, my skepticism died. A shade striving through human filth. Every step he took sent waves throughout the place he had infiltrated.

Sometimes he orchestrated entire uprisings that could only end in blood with only crows reigning supreme over the graveyard he had filled. Though more often than I would like to believe, all he needed to do was a minute action. Nothing but a little push to cause a ripple that would summon a tsunami. 

An unfortunate accident of someone important or the right words whispered into the ears of a future terrorist. Despite my extensive studies of the beast, I can’t tell how he knows who or what to influence to bring his wanted outcome. Perhaps he can see the future or all the different potential futures. Perhaps he is just guessing, and only his successful attempts have been documented. His failures would remain unknown to us. If there are any.

As to what I believe, I think the beast can glimpse into the human heart. It can decipher what we carry in our chest, hidden even from ourselves. With this information, the beast can play every human to a degree where it appears to be mind control. His capabilities are more akin to rewriting fate; as if he put us all on a determined path that would bring nothing but destruction.

This, at least, is what my father, my family, and every other doomed soul believed about him. To explain further, dear reader, you have to indulge me. Before unmasking the beast, I have to describe what brought me to the point of writing it all down so other people could learn of this thing. Then you will understand.

As I said, my father opened my eyes to the harsh truth when I was an adult. But even before that, I could tell something was wrong with my father. He always appeared to be preoccupied. As if something was haunting his mind. Father never cared for any of my interests or me in particular. Mother and I were nothing but noise irritating his important work. I asked Mother a few times why Father behaved in such a way. She knew about the beast, but I can’t tell when Father explained it to her.

“You will see, Jonathan,” she used to say. “Soon you will see.”

The only time Father invested his precious time into me was due to my education. Anything besides the best wasn’t good enough. Father never raised his voice against me or hit me, but he punished me with silence. His eyes were always cold, but when I couldn’t meet his high expectations, they gained a certain loathing for me. Before his disinterest would originate from a genuine lack of care, now it would arise from disdain. Only when I redeemed myself did he cease.

Praise was a rare occurrence but when it came, I held on to it like a thirsting man to water, using up every bit of it in my fruitless attempt to satiate myself. Mother was much the same. It might sound cruel, but I didn't think of her as a person. She served more as an extension to my father. She never spoke about the time before she met him. The way she acted, you would think there was no such time. I don’t know what she saw in him to cast aside her identity and any hope for a loving husband in favor of my father, who appeared to have lost all interest in her once I was born.

The only reason to be intimate with her was to create me. Nothing had any sentimental value according to my father. It was nothing but a means to an end. My mother to birth an heir, and me to carry on the family oath. An oath inherited from father to son for lord knows how long. My family history is not something I enjoy studying. It is filled with tragedy and agony; much brought on by my ancestors themselves in their obsessed drive to hunt the beast.

I can only speculate how my grandfather treated my father, but by his hostile demeanor, it couldn’t have been better than my upbringing. Worse by the way he screamed in his sleep. Whatever it was, Father never dared to speak it out loud, but it influenced his every action and instilled him with the drive to end this generational-spanning pursuit. I shared this desire to end it all, as the thought of putting a child of mine through the same training I went through filled me with dread.

Every waking hour was focused on strengthening my body and honing my mind. I had to endure several harsh years of combat training and study concerning the beast. All for increasing my chance to not just survive an encounter with him but to also defeat him. Despite my father’s many shortcomings, he knew his craft and how to pass on his knowledge and skill to the next generation.

In these years, I learned to hate my father in earnest. Before that, I was afraid of his judgment and yearned for his approval. But after receiving his complete attention, I came to understand that my father’s opinion shouldn’t be something to be considered. But I stayed. I stayed by my father’s side and did everything he told me to do.

After just a year, I had all the expertise to flee his grasp and survive on my own. Then why didn’t I? Easy, he had a point. The beast had to die. The fallen deserved to be avenged. And while my father was someone that I didn’t owe anything to, he was my best chance in eliminating the beast.

I think it was during the fourth year of my training that my father either thought I was prepared enough, or he couldn’t wait any longer. He was possessed by the wish to be the one who defeats the beast and puts an end to his secret reign. Gathering all the intel we had on the beasts, collected over countless decades by my family, we crafted our plan.

Based on all we had on the beast, we could narrow down his current location and identity. The beast wasn’t just a master manipulator but also a genius actor. How many characters he made up over his long existence to blend into human society is impossible to tell. Tricking such a being should appear to be impossible, but my father and I noticed something.

Hidden underneath all the evidence of the beast’s existence and his deeds, there was a pattern. He was unstable. Despite all the knowledge and cunning he had, he often committed grievous mistakes, which seemed to pile up over the years. Did he lose his caution, as no one had been able to stop him yet? Or was something else occurring?

At this point, we couldn’t say, but we knew for certain that the beast wasn’t perfect. Take my family, for example. As I have already mentioned, many of my ancestors didn’t enjoy a long life. Dedicating yourself to a war against the devil himself didn’t just promise a constant threat to your physical health but also to your psyche. While the beast laid waste to several members of my bloodline, many more couldn’t handle the truth and looming shadow of the adversary, taking solace in drugs or alcohol. Or mere severe measurements.

Why then didn’t the beast end my family? Why take the risk of anyone coming for you; no matter how slight the chances of one’s own loss? The answer is the beast had tried. He had tried to kill every single one of my ancestors but failed to do so. Multiple times he came close, but always one member of my family escaped. Why not turn the tables and hunt the hunter? Because for some reason, the beast couldn’t.

Furthermore, the beast showed periods of inactivity. While measuring his actions proved near impossible, as often his influence was too faint to notice, we were able to map his deeds. Similar to his incompetence, his level of downtime was increasing. Did he need to rest more the further he aged? Questions over questions and there was only one way to answer them all.

My father and I took a great risk by going after the beast with such lacking intel, but both of us were keen to end the hunt. It appeared we didn’t just inherit the responsibility to stop the beast but also the tiredness of an entire bloodline, fighting for far too long. So, after months of observation and stalking, we were able to find him.

With the difficult part done, we went for the near-impossible one. Catching him. You see, Father didn’t just want to assassinate the beast, he wanted to capture him. The family records indicate that the beast isn’t someone to be trifled with, but he doesn’t seem to be unkillable. Ageless yes, but not immortal. This being said, he would not die as easily as a human being would.

One of my ancestors for example shot the beast six times in the chest. The bullets drove him to death’s door, but he succeeded in escaping justice despite his injuries. This showed us that we couldn’t believe normal measures to be sufficient to accomplish the deed. But perhaps it would have been. We were certain the beast was weakened, so maybe a well-timed bullet to the head would have been all it needed.

But no, father wasn’t willing to take any more risks. So, we decided to capture him and to take our time ending him. To accomplish this, we started to poison him. Small doses at first, nothing that should alarm him. We wanted to test out whether it would numb him enough to seize him.

One of the training fields which I had to master was deception and disguise but fooling the fools’ lord was impossible. Once alarmed, the beast would vanish, and it would take decades to find him again. So, we couldn’t come into direct contact with him, but with the people around him.

The coffee shops the beast loved to visit, his workplace, and his favorite restaurant. The beast is a creature of habit, and we had his schedule mapped out. We knew when he wasn’t nearby, so we could infiltrate his surroundings to place our drugs and poisons. And within days, our plan proved itself successful.

The beast appeared sick, barely able to keep his eyes open. His workplace ordered him to stay put at home and only return once cured. Dear reader, you might question our strategy. How could a being such as the beast ever fall sick? Wouldn’t such a creature be immune against all mortal illnesses?

The short answer is no. The beast’s body had been ravaged by the plague three different times. This allowed some of my ancestors and other hunters to find and fight him. But no matter the infliction, he persevered, but he suffered, nonetheless. And, more importantly, he was afraid for his life.

The beast did as he was told and remained at his home. On the third day, he went out to do some shopping. He had no one in his life to do this for him, fitting for a being of his nature. This was when we ambushed him. My father lured him next to our van by asking for directions. I told you, dear reader, I fear that the beast can look into the human heart and read it like a book. He should have noticed our intentions immediately right away. I thought the sickness was hindering his observation skills. Furthermore, I thought the beast believed himself safe, having forgotten all his caution.

Father distracted him for a few moments, so I could sneak out of the van. It happened within moments. The beast described which direction my father should take to reach his destination as I flung my arm around his neck and injected him with a mixture of drugs strong enough to knock out a horse. He was struggling underneath my hold, and I noticed his inhuman strength. If he hadn’t been weakened before, he could free himself with ease. As the mixture began to spread, I dragged him into the van. Once I closed the door, he had lost consciousness.

We brought him to our home and locked him up in our basement. Our house was reinforced and prepared for a direct assault of the beast. But also, to keep it there if the opportunity should open itself up to us. We bound him to a chair with locks of steel inside a cage. There were no windows, and the only door could take a rocket blast. Just for good measure.

I don’t know how long we watched his unconscious body. The arch enemy of not just our family but our very species trapped in front of us. Quite the sight to behold. Or so it should have been. I knew the beast looked like a common man, but you expect to see something in him. Some minute detail he got wrong. Something that would mark him as the devil. But no, he looked like someone ordinary. A bit disappointing.

He stirred after a few hours. He took in his surroundings, and the realization of his situation dawned on him. The lord of fools could act like no one. He begged. He sobbed. Screams for help. The beast fought against his restraints, roaring to be freed. My chest tightened at his performance. If I had been a lesser man, I would have believed him.

Father wasn’t moved either. He took his seat in front of the beast and began his questioning. He was keen to learn more about him before killing him.

“What are you talking about, man?!” the beast cried. “I have no idea what you’re talking about!”

Every time the beast failed to answer, Father hit him. Strong from the beginning, but his punches lacked the ferocity I knew my father to be capable of. That changed within an hour. Blood littered the floor accompanied by several teeth. It was a difficult thing to watch. The never-ending cries and my father’s wrath.

“Show yourself, devil!” my father screamed. He seized the beast by his hair, wet with sweat and blood. “Your lies won’t convince anyone!”

The beast’s face was swollen. His eyes were shut, and his nose was broken several times; any resemblance of a human appearance was beaten out of his features. My father collapsed in his chair, panting. He had kept himself in peak condition. He could run any marathon with ease and his punches could crack a human skull with just one hit. That the beast had survived his barrage for hours by this point proved beyond a doubt that this wasn’t a man in front of me.

“Jonathan, do it,” Father said, wiping away the blood from his hands.

I took out the bag of tools we had prepared for this moment. I do not intend to describe what I did to the beast. My father took joy in his torment. That’s why I think we kept him for as long as possible. Not to learn anything, but to make him suffer. To force the devil to endure his own domain for once, share the fate of any poor sinner, doomed for eternity.

I didn’t enjoy it. Often, I had dreams of grandeur. Of me being the savior that would free humankind of their worst adversary. That I would make the beast experience true regret once I was finished with him. Reality was less spectacular. I tortured him. Every pain you could imagine, I drowned him in. Agony you couldn’t even begin to grasp. Even if you torment the devil himself, your hands will be soiled by sin that can’t be washed away. It shouldn’t. It should stick to you to remind yourself what you are capable of and willing to commit.

Three days. Three days the beast endured… no, three days I endured.

Until this point, I had successfully disassociated myself from the situation and me. But as I was taking a break, cleaning myself, I started shaking. I couldn’t stand any more of this.

“Just say it,” I said, turning towards the beast. “Just tell him what he wants to learn.”

The beast was covered in blood and wounds. I hadn’t left a single spot untouched. His flesh was burned, cut, crushed, and worse. How many bones I broke or limbs I destroyed, I don’t dare to ponder. His body was more composed of freshly made scars than anything else, burrowing deep, speaking of pain reaching down towards hell. Yet, he hadn’t died.

The beast’s head hung low, twitching. He was muttering something to himself. I grabbed a knife for the chance he would try something and approached him. I had to step next to him to hear his weak whispers.

“I can’t…,” he said. “I can’t wake. Let me sleep. I can’t endure it…”

“Then confess!” I said. “Be truthful towards my father, and I promise your suffering will cease!”

The beast shook his head, tears falling. “It hurts… it hurts so much…”

Somehow, I knew he wasn’t speaking about the torture I put him through. “What do you mean? What is hurting you?”

“My head… it’s full. Please, I don’t want to wake…”

“What are you talking about, devil? Answer me?!”

“It hurts?!” the beast screamed. He jerked his head up, staring at me. I was startled, moving away from him. While his eyes had been shut swollen two days ago, his body had an unnatural capability to heal itself. Consequently, the swelling had receded, and I could see them. His right eye still had the light blue tone as when we captured him, but not his left one. The iris was drenched in a dark that would devour you if you wouldn’t be careful with a hot crimson star in its midst. It burned. An inferno trapped inside his head, so intense it blinded me.

“It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!”

He didn’t stop screaming the same phrase again. He wanted to trash around, the bindings cutting into his flesh as they held him. He threw his head back, his chest rising and falling in violent interludes. Blood poured out of his left eye, red tears descending like a comet toward the ground. The look he gave me. No malice, no promise of revenge or carnage. Inside this trapped star of his, I saw no devil but a broken being, driven mad.

His wild stare pierced into me with the weight of too many lives. “Why did you wake me?! Why?!”

Like a savage monster, the beast rampaged against his chains. A rage born from something I couldn’t understand took hold of him. But neither my father nor I were the target of his ire. I think the world itself or perhaps something grander laid at the core of his wrath. Too big to seize or to rip apart. Without a direct perpetrator to take revenge against, the beast seemed to want to tear apart anything too close to it, blinded by his inner turmoil. Something needed to die to clench this lust of his.

Dear reader, I can’t begin to describe the dread filling my lungs with every breath I took, pushing out the air I would have needed. Standing in close approximation to the beast and his anger crippled my mind and body, forgetting how to perform the simplest of tasks. How do I move my legs? How do I blink? How do I breathe?

“It’s all your fault!” the beast spat at me. “All of you should go to hell! You should burn! All of you! Burn, you should! Burn!”

As his left eye turned towards me, I became the only thing it seemed to perceive in the whole world. Its inferno leaked out of it, and I swear, dear reader, I could feel the heat of it. It bit into me, threatening to burn away my flesh and soul alike. This little taste of it, of the agony that would await me, was all it took to make me run up the stairs and flee.

The next hours are nothing but a blur. I can recall taking my parents' car and driving until it had no fuel anymore. I left it abandoned on the street and made my way through a forest, dodging tree branches and other obstacles in my mad sprint. When I came to stop or why I don’t know.

All I remember was cowering against a massive rock, pushing my back into the moss growing on its surface. Like waking from a nightmare, I blinked at my surroundings, having to remind myself that whatever I thought to have gone through was over. That I was back in reality. Night was already on the rise, and I feared to have been lost in the forest. Thankfully, I hadn’t made it far into its green embrace and found my way out of it easily enough.

I walked all night, haunted by my own cowardice. Father would be infuriated. I would never hear the end of it. But this was nothing more than a passing thought. This cursed eye followed me like a wraith, digging its claws into my skull, refusing to let go. To find any refuge from its haunting presence, I replayed the strange rumblings of the beast. What had he meant?

I didn’t find an answer on my walk. My mind was in shambles. As the sun rose again, I had arrived at home, or what was left of it. At first glance, it didn’t seem of the ordinary. But once I noticed the bloody handprint on the open door, I knew what had happened. I stood there for a couple of minutes, licking over my dry lips.

Did I want to see my dead parents? Did I need to see their shredded corpses, their guts littered over the floor? I don’t know whether I ever truly loved my parents. Thinking of them in this regard appears alien to me. Why treat them in a way they never treated me? But as I stepped towards my old house, I could sense a tear making its way down my cheek. I felt relieved at its presence, living proof that I was still somewhat human.

It was the only one I shed for them. 

I won’t describe them to you. They deserve this much at least. Just let it be known that they tried to fight.

The beast had broken free of his shackles probably shortly after I fled, ripped skin and flesh still sticking to the shattered steel. In a daze, I sat down in the very spot the beast had been trapped in. I didn’t care for the blood soiling my clothing. I had bigger things on my mind.

Did I feel hate for the beast? I can’t say for sure. The glimpse I received of him had disturbed my outlook on him. But, after pondering the last conversation I had with him, I came to understand who he really was. His fate.

And here we are, dear reader. We’ve reached the end of my story, but this little tale is not over yet. You might remember that I promised to unmask the beast. That is only partially true. You would be forgiven for calling me a liar. I didn’t do so with ill intent. Everything I ever committed, I ever partook in, was only for the betterment of humanity.

I believed killing the beast a great service to my species, one that would remain unknown to them all, who yet couldn’t live without my deeds. I wasn’t wrong, but my goals have somewhat shifted. And the reason for that is you, dear reader.

One of you is not who they believe they are. You are not a bad person. You didn’t choose to be born like that. I thought you were a devil. Perhaps you were once. I can’t say. But what I can say is that I think I understand your turmoil. No, his turmoil.

No mind was made to endure eternity. The weight of his memories is crushing him, aren’t they? When I had woken him, I had woken him to them. Had he really fed on our suffering, or had he lashed out against anything that had taken him out of his slumber?

Is that why he had manipulated? Why he had pushed for destruction, as it was the only act of revenge he’d had for this cruel world that had birthed him? I won’t forgive him. I don’t think anyone can. My speculations shouldn’t be misunderstood as me trying to absolve him of his sins. They are his crimes, but not yours. You are a victim, unknowingly at that. But he is the same. A victim, too, but also a perpetrator. A broken child and a savage beast.  

Dear reader, I know you are not aware of the true nature of your being. You are nothing more than a pleasant dream. A dream of normality. An ordinary life, free of the curse of eternity. But every dream will come to an end. The beast will lash out again, and I can’t let this happen. Too many people have died. This needs to end.

You might wonder how I found you. How do I know you will be amongst the few to read these very lines? The answer is simple. I finally understand you. The reason my family and the others all had failed is because none had attempted to comprehend what they were hunting. The beast was never alone. You were always by his side, shielding him from his suffering. The beast had appeared unknowable. Something beyond human that we can’t ever truly predict. That only after decades of close reading we might hope to find his scent again.

But not me. Not anymore. Every step you take, every thought rushing through your mind, every tear you shed. Like an open book, you are to me now. You won’t see me coming. You won’t feel a thing. When you read this, you will think me either mad or this being nothing but a crude joke. And if you believe a single word I wrote, you won’t think yourself the beast. You will believe someone else to house the monster.

This is good. You will die convinced being human. This grace I will grant you. Why am I writing these words then? Why am I announcing my coming? It is not for my desire to tell my story or to warn you but for the beast inside. Despite being asleep, I believe him to be watching. To hear what you hear through a veil, a faint echo he can perceive.

I want him to know his suffering will end. And to you, dear reader, I am sorry. Sorry that it had to be you. May we all meet under a brighter sun. Somewhere free of curses.

And now, dear reader, it is time to say goodbye. For now.",1,1753089650.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

July 12^(th), 1823

When I left London in the autumn of 1817, I was unprepared for what was to transpire. As such, I must preface this journal. I am not proud of what happened, and it has remained on my mind ever since. I warn any that would read this that, despite the fantastical nature and implausibility of what I witnessed, I maintain that every word written hereafter is the truth as I experienced it.



As I intend to keep this journal hidden until my death, both in hopes of maintaining some modicum of dignity and ensuring that my crimes are judged only by the highest power, I feel that I should introduce both myself and Silas.



For much of the war I maintained something of a correspondence with my old friend, Silas. I met him at University back in 1808 and together we shared a passion for anthropology, brandy, and cigars. We exchanged perhaps one letter every month or two as the packet ships allowed, he keeping me informed of his research and discoveries within the field.



As I had set out for Portugal in 1810, he had pressed me to undertake research parallel to his own; to examine the folklore of the peasantry in the rural backwaters that the war would no doubt bring me to. Throughout much of the Iberian campaign, encouraged by Silas’ letters, I did just that. Whilst my mind is incomparable to those of many of my contemporaries, I wrote some papers that became well liked amongst certain circles in London and Oxford, a fact of which I remain quite proud.



However, by ‘13, I was much fatigued in both mind and spirit. One conclusion that I drew from the war was that a mortal man can only witness so many horrors before he loses some piece of himself irrevocably. The violence I was witness to, that I myself sometimes undertook, I felt had marked my soul in some fashion. It left me with a darkness, a pox on my spirit, and I believed at that point that I should never know heaven.



The occurrences that fill the rest of this journal have made me quite certain.





October 27^(th), 1817



It has been now two months since I returned from Holland. I have taken it upon myself to resume my correspondence with Silas. Though I have not put ink to paper for some years now, Silas’ unapologetic enthusiasm has reinvigorated me. Half pay was damning to me, so I sold my commission, but I have accomplished nothing since. My mother had arranged work with a banking firm, but I have not taken up the offer. I have been melancholic, filling my days with laudanum and drink.



Yet Silas’ most recent letter has offered a far more tantalising opportunity. He has been in Scotland for some months, seeking to write a study on Gaelic folklore, and his notes and initial translations are utterly fascinating. In his letter he asks me to travel to the village where he’s quartered, and assist him with his research.



As I am still rather flush with money and have no real prospects in London, I mean to accept his offer. I am certain the fresh air and country living will do wonders for my mind.



November 10^(th), 1817



Nearly a fortnight spent in a coach has left me near crippled. I should think I’d rather march over the Pyrenees again than make such a journey at such speeds. Nevertheless, I am staying but a day’s travel from my destination, some small and unpronounceable village in the Highlands. I have had to hire a wagon for tomorrow, laden as I am with a cask of brandy, case of cigars, and a sack of good coffee along with my notes and conventional luggage.



I am much looking forward to resuming my rapport with Silas. Though he may be a papist, mason, and, worst of all, an Irishman, he has a most generous soul and a quick-witted humour. He is cousin to many well-respected men of science, and has become well-renowned for his own work.



On another note, the language here is wondrous. Guttural and primitive, yet I feel in some ways it shares a similarity to Portuguese, though I understand not a word of it.



November 11^(th), 1817



The village is smaller even than I expected. Perhaps twenty houses, all of rough undressed stone, perched on a long and low ridge in the shadow of some notable mountains, already with a dusting of snow. A few crude wooden barns are on the south side. There is no church or even chapel, and the remnants of a castle stand on one of the smaller peaks about three miles north.



The villagers themselves farm a few fields around the village before they give way to rolling moors, yet the majority of them are shepherds. The men often go in coarse skirts, and all of them are large and dull stock, the sort of peasant that has been unchanged for centuries or longer, untouched by the hand of civilisation.



It is easy to share Silas’ passion for them. Though I speak not a word of their language, their manner is clearly alien to English sensibilities. The land is dotted with stone cairns and carved standing stones, and the doors of the houses are decorated with sprigs of rowan and small wheels of iron.



Silas himself has changed greatly. He was always a stocky, well-built man, yet now he has the ruddy complexion of a drinker many years his senior, and he is now fat as a hog. Nevertheless, it was a wonderful reunion.



As my wagon driver unloaded my copious luggage, the people gathered, crude shawls and coats pulled tight against the biting wind. Yet not one of them stepped forward to help, they merely stood, as skittish as deer.



From one of the houses Silas came roaring, welcoming me with a strong handshake and coaxing two village boys at last into helping me with my belongings.



Silas was now telling the names of everyone we passed, there being around fifty people in the village, and of those names I remembered none. We entered the house which he and I would be staying. It had a single room with a low ceiling and small hearth, a pair of crude chairs set facing it. By the small window beside the door was a large table covered with hundreds of papers, mostly illustrations, and a lock-box around the size of a ledger. The back half of the building was covered by a canvas partition, behind which, he assured me, a truly horrible bed awaited.



From then, he introduced the old woman he’d employed as housekeeper, Euphan. She spoke no English, and seemed slow witted, and the slope of her cranium under her thinning hair would certainly make a fascinating study for a phrenologist.



Then, she brought for us a good leg of mutton and some cabbage, which I devoured, hungry as I was from the travel. After, Silas and I settled by the fire with some brandy and cigars, and he began to talk.



Firstly, he reacquainted me with his research, telling me of the ancient pre-Christian beliefs and gods that were still known through myths and seen in their superstitions. At this I mentioned the small iron wheels and sprigs of rowan I saw on the doorways, and he acknowledged that it was a ritual to drive away malevolent spirits.



“And I noted you also have the same bauble on your door.” I said.



“Indeed. The locals become quite disturbed should I not partake. They are a simple people and it is best to allay their fears.”



I nodded, then Silas took his watch from his vest and remarked as to the time.



“A few rules, if you’ll oblige me.” He said.



“Certainly.”



“Avoid the castle, and don’t venture out of the village once it’s dark. The local wolves up in the mountains have killed a number of sheep, and are thought to have killed a girl last year. Especially in winter, they can be quite aggressive.”



“Wolves have been extinct for over a century, have they not?” I asked.



“That is the common conception. However-” he retrieved something from his pocket and handed it to me.



In my hand was what indeed appeared to be a handkerchief-sized piece of cured animal skin, and the dense gray fur certainly looked like that of the wolves I’d seen in the Pyrenees.



Silas continued, “There is a small but vicious pack in the mountains. We killed that one last winter, but more have been seen. They seem to be denned around the castle.”



I could hardly reject the evidence in my hands, so I agreed to what seemed reasonable demands, and assured Silas I’d keep my pistol on me at all times.



“And you mustn’t go out when there’s fog.”



“Are there wolves hiding in the fog too?” I japed, which elicited a chuckle from Silas.



“Not quite. The fog rolls in damnably fast, and a number of people have become very lost. We normally find them a day or two later, and they are always quite shaken. But some are less lucky, and die out on the moors.”



It was a grim note to end the evening on, but I look forward to the morning.



November 12^(th), 1817



I was woken with a start by Silas’ morning ablutions. The bed had lived up to its promise; coarse wool blankets over hay. I slept poorly, as happens in the absence of laudanum, and had the usual nightmares, of smoke-wreathed battlefields and horses foaming at the bit, of roundshot gouging bloody terror into my company, and of stinking bloated bodies piled high in whitewashed plazas.



This morning was quite clear, if somewhat overcast, with a hard coating of frost making the moors and mountains pale in the paler light. We breakfasted on bread and cheese and Euphan was able to make a palatable pot of coffee. We went first to a large building that served as a town hall, where to my pleasure I met a few local men who had a fair grasp of English.



Unfortunately there was ill news that morning. A shepard girl had not returned the previous day, and Silas told me that the town assumed wolves had attacked her. I saw many around that room grasping at small trinkets of iron and covering their eyes with a hand.



From Bombay to Mexico, men fear death. I have seen that fear many times, in many faces. In faces of friends, and sometimes in the face of a stranger at the end of my sword or pistol. It seems to me a perverse juxtaposition that even godly, Christian men, in their last moments, give in to some baser instinct beyond the word of God and the promise of heaven.



Until today I thought I had grown to accustomed to seeing that expression to feel much, yet the looks on the faces of those villagers this morning made my blood run cold.



After that meeting, Silas left to speak with some of the villagers, so I returned home. Euphan was sweeping when I arrived and croaked something at me, gesturing to Silas’ work table. I was unable to comprehend what it was that she expected for me, so I smiled and shook my head and she stopped. From there, I went to my luggage and withdrew my pistol, powder flask, and some shot.



It is only a simple Elliot pattern pistol, usually issued to dragoons, but it’s clip fit well to my belt, and with the ammunition in my pockets, I decided to walk the moors.



On the way through the town I encountered a youth, Rory, who had some schooling when staying with his aunt in Edinburgh and had a fair grasp of English. He seemed to be somewhat grieved by the news, and so I felt obliged to ask:



“Were you sweet on her?”



The boy wrung his hands “Not like that, not really, but she was sweet, and rare pretty too. A good lass.”



The boy agreed to join me on my walk, and I let him hold my pistol, much to his joy. The air was fresh and crisp that morning, rich with the scent of wild heather and grass. The ground itself had a springiness to it as we walked somewhat aimlessly north-east, towards the woods that dotted the base of the mountains.



The boy was fascinated by the service, as boys are prone to be, and he asked a great deal of questions about muskets and cannons and the navy ships I’d been on and the French.



“Is it true that they stink and their teeth are all rotted?”



“No, no more so than us, at least.”



Rory nodded. “I t’ain’t never seen a Frenchman.”



“They are the same as us, for the most part, with the exception of their language.”



The boy nodded amiably, and upon his insistence I rolled up my hose to show the scar in my calf from a musket ball I’d taken at Waterloo.

“Did it not come out t’other side, then?”



“No. It was shot at a very extreme range, and it was all but spent when it hit me. Otherwise, I dare say I’d have lost the whole leg.”



We talked more as we entered the copse of pine and rowan and ash. The smells of heather and grass gave way to the richness of sap and leaf litter. It was then that Rory asked me the question I’d been both expecting and dreading.



“Did y’ever kill anyone?”



For a moment I had to stand still, and all the air rushed out of me as if I’d taken a blow to the gut. The world around me seemed to tilt, and I swear for a moment my shirt and coat were gone, the cool breeze changed. I was standing between walls, whitewashed and bloodstained, in my reeking, stuffy uniform under the still heat of the Spanish sun, and as the Highlanders of the 71^(st) Foot charged with bloodied bayonets around me, I was looking into the eyes of a terrified young French officer as we faced one another with swords drawn.



“Yes.” I said, barely more than a whisper. “The first time was at a village in Spain. It’s not a pleasant memory, I’m afraid.”



The boy seemed puzzled by this. He said that there’s honour in fighting for ones country, or other words to that effect. In truth it’s not something soldiers often spoke of. They joke around the subject, to be certain, but precious few enjoy discussions of killing, except for those base killers who are divorced from humanity and take pleasure in cruelty and violence.



I told the boy. “He was an officer. We were both lieutenants, around the same age, probably only a few years older than you are now.” The boy listened keenly.



“It was terrifying. We were both utterly besides ourselves with fear. He came at me with a few chops, and I just kept stepping back. Then I lunged at him, and he started babbling. Crying. Then I pierced him.”



I poked Rory with my finger.



“Right there. Then he dropped his sabre, starting crying. I kept stabbing at him, and his blood began to run down his front. He was screaming, and I think I was screaming too. I don’t know how many times I stabbed him, but then he sat down in the road, gurgling, then. He just starting talking, begging me not to kill him. *Pitié… pitié… me tuez pas… faut que j’voie ma mère… j’lui ai dit… j’lui ai dit que j’rentrerais…* That’s what he said. That he promised his mother he’d come home.”



Rory stared at me, and I saw in his eyes my words had found some meaning.



We kept walking, my heart heavy.



And that’s when we found her.



There was a feeling, as we approached that clearing, like the tension before lightning. In retrospect, it was like some sense of foreboding had entered me as I had talked to Rory.



She was sitting on the ground facing away from us. Her gold hair ran down her back like water.



I had already put my hand on Rory’s shoulder as he shouted her name and tried to run to her.



When you see a corpse for the first time you realise that there is something divine in life, some spark of god, and when you die that fades.



I knew she was dead the instant I saw her.



I shook the boy, shouted at him, and sent him running back to the village for help.



And then I was alone as the slapping of his feet fell away.



Alone save for the girl.



I stepped up to her, and in front of her.



What had killed her was no wolf, nor any of god’s creatures. She was pale, almost blue, her milky eyes staring forward into some unseen oblivion. In life, no doubt she was very pretty, but in death a body becomes instantly twisted and unsettling. Her flawless face, her fine nose, her large eyes, all of them compounded to make a truly hideous sight.



There was no mark on her, no wound. No sign of violence. It was as if she had simply sat down in that clearing and life had abandoned her.



Gently, I laid her on her back, stiff though she was, and I closed her eyes.



Then I sat over her, and I prayed.



The villagers came after around an hour. They said nothing, but stood around us. Silas came forward, unusually grim, and put a hand on my shoulder. I lifted the girl, and she was so very light, far lighter than anyone I’d ever carried. The villagers followed in a silent, mournful procession, and Rory led the way without a word, tears streaming down his cheeks.



When we arrived, even the dogs were quiet, and I took the girl to her house, and her mother collapsed and wept and screamed and tore at her hair, whilst her father sat facing away from the world and the girl’s siblings held each other and cried.



The crying keeps going, even as I sit writing this.



Silas then took me home, and explained to me with some reserve that these people have strange and alien burial customs, that I should not interfere and let them act as is their way. I was puzzled, and asked what he meant.



“There are old stories here. Stories of the dead.”



“In what sense? That’s true the world over.”



Silas nodded, and took a good measure of brandy before he continued. “The Celtic peoples have a strong belief in spirits, revenants. There are things that must be done in order to ensure that the dead do not return.”



I sighed. “All peoples have similar superstitions.”

Silas looked at me. “And why might that be? What is there to fear from the dead? Why does god render unto us such fear?”



“To ensure that the dead are treated properly, buried correctly, prayed for.” I drank deeply from the amber brandy.



“And what do the dead do when they are treated poorly?”



Then conversation ended not long later. Neither of us were particularly convivial, and the brandy couldn’t coax an ounce of humour back into us.



November 13^(th), 1817



Last night I dreamt of a beautiful girl atop a castle. She had big eyes and blonde hair. She wore the uniform of a French infantry lieutenant and she begged for her life in a language I did not understand as I stabbed at her.



I awoke shortly after dawn to a great din in the village. People were moving, talking, some shouting. Silas was also awake, drawing at his desk, and Euphan was nowhere to be found, so I had to grind my own beans to brew the two of us coffee. Though by the time we’d drank it and eaten some biscuit all was quiet.



We left only to find the village now almost deserted, the morning clear and bright, traces of fog burning away beneath the weak winter sun. Euphan emerged from her hovel and pointed us along to the north east. On walking past the low stone houses of the village, we saw perhaps two miles distant, the villagers were working on a new cairn, not unlike the others scattered on the moors.



We approached, and found a bizarre sight.



The villagers seemed no longer mournful, but weary. The girl had been carried in a wagon, and was dressed in a simple white woollen dress, laying almost peacefully in the wagon. Just as perfect and beautiful and blue and unnerving as she had been when I first found her. The family were standing protectively by the wagon, as a big bearded fellow spoke demandingly, hefting a wood-axe. Rory stood on, helpless. The donkey that must have hauled the wagon was on the verge of bolting, ears back, teeth bared, and whining.



Silas grabbed my arm as he quickly exchanged words with the axeman. Then he turned to me.



“They are discussing… dismemberment.” He told me, not meeting my gaze.



“What?” I cried out.



“As I said last night. There are customs, rituals, that these people observe, to avoid the return of the dead.”



I shook my head. “But they want to cut her up like a flank of beef? That’s barbaric.”



“Quite, quite. Yet they have their beliefs. We are here to observe, don’t forget.”



The Axeman was pushing aside the family. I recalled in that moment, words I had exchanged years before. A sergeant I had met at the field of Waterloo, of the 33^(rd), had told me of his time in India. The Hindoo are afraid of dismemberment, as they believe that they could not enter their heaven unless they were whole. The man had told me gleefully how they had bound Hindoos to the front of cannon, and blasted them to pieces.



In that instant, looking down at that hideous, beautiful girl in the wagon, axeman poised above her, I brought up my pistol and pointed it at the man, dragging back the hammer to full cock.



“No.” I recall I said.



The villagers were quick enough to obey beneath my muzzle, and the girl was put into the ground, adorned with a sprig of rowan upon her breast. They buried her dutifully, and piled the stones six foot high, as the sun vanished behind the clouds and the world grew cold. None of them knew the pistol was not loaded.



Once the girl was interred, my pistol long since put away, and the sun having reached its zenith hours hence, the villages seemed to look to me, as if for guidance.



I looked to Silas. “Should I perhaps say a prayer?”



Silas exchanged some swift Gaelic, and was met with nods, men doffing their hats or tugging at forelocks. He nodded to me.



The sun was lowering in the cold sky, and I had read the words enough times to not need the book.



“Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name… Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our bread. Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is thy kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.”



The mourners mumbled their own amens, several even crossed themselves.



After, Silas and I returned home, and over a cigar and brandy, he looked over to me.



“Do you know what’s in my lock-box?”



I told him, truthfully, that I didn’t.



“There is research in there. Notes I made during my travels. Whilst you fought the French across Iberia, I travelled my native Ireland, and, for a short while in ‘13 and ‘14, I travelled across to America.”



I nodded. Our correspondence had become erratic in that time.



“I’ve heard strange tales the world over.” He continued. “A Chinese seaman told me of Jiungshee, a voodoo in New Orleans told me of rituals to raise the dead, a Moldavian I encountered aboard a ship told me of the Strigoi. I have become convinced that of all these stories and cultures, there must be some modicum of truth to them.”



Silas was leaning forward, and I could see how tired and old he appeared, with a feverish fire in his eyes.



I still am not sure how I felt. I remembered, after Waterloo, a prisoner, a Pole of the Polish Lancers, had killed a man he was imprisoned with. He’d bitten through his throat, and was covered in blood when we found him and threw him before a firing squad. The whole time, pale and wide eyed, he’d screamed that he was Vjesci, Vjesci.



“There are mad men anywhere, who seek to undo life or else play with death.” I said.



“Are you certain? I am sure. So very sure. There are things that defy both god and science. And I fear them.”



I found myself most perturbed by this revelation. I knew Silas to be a man of reason and learning. To hear him so swayed by the superstitions of savages and madmen was unexpected.



“How did the girl die?” He asked.



“Obviously, she became lost and froze to death in the night. I’ve seen men who died whilst standing in the winter of ‘11.” I was concerned that he even had to ask.



“But you carried the girl back. Did anything seem missing?”



“Missing?”



He looked at me. “Did she not feel too light?”



I shall not drink tonight.



November 14^(th), 1817



I awoke long before dawn. The dream I had was as violent and terrible as usual, but this time the violence was inflicted on me, by a young girl with golden hair.



As soon as I was dressed I departed the house. I do not know how to put it into words, yet I was certain something was wrong. That same feeling, the tension in my chest, had returned as I slept.



It was cold outside, freezing, frost lay over everything and my breath curled before me. The sky was clear, the stars bright and the moon pale and haloed in a symptom of the encroaching cold.



The village was almost deserted, save for Euphan, who was carrying a chicken no doubt meant to be my breakfast. I nodded to her and she stopped to watch me pass with eyes downcast.



I was heading north east, as my aching chest led me to it like iron to a lodestone.



Beyond the village was the dread silence of the night. Only the sound of the frost crunching beneath my boots followed me as I stalked across the land, the moors suffocated beneath a knee high fog.



The cairn was gone.



Where it should be there was nothing but the writhing fog. My feet found for me the stones, scattered as men are scattered by grapeshot.



I was at this point in a panic, half demented, and as I stalked back and forth my feet suddenly found no ground beneath them.



I fell, face first, into the girl’s open grave, and it was empty.



As my hands sought purchase in the freezing dirt, to push myself up, they closed around something.



By the light of the moon, as I extricated myself from the grave, I saw what was in my hand. A sprig of rowan, burnt now to charcoal.



Standing there, by that empty grave, I felt a wrongness like I’ve never known. I have seen many graves, often on a scale most couldn’t fathom, but something about this one moved me. There was a feeling of oppression that clamped around my heart, and I felt in that moment like a deer realising it’s being stalked.



I felt watched, perceived, and I looked around. But the moors were silent, devoid of any life.



I looked upwards, and there was the castle, a mile distant.



It was as if I could feel the castle itself watching me, casting a malevolent eye over my profaning of that empty grave.



My mind raced as my heart pounded against my ribs, and the castle watched my panic and judged me, as I fled back towards the village.



Not long after dawn, Silas arose, and I immediately told him that the grave was empty.



All colour drained from his face, and his breathing grew laboured.



“We must search every house in town.” I declared.



Silas looked at me sidelong, puzzled. “For what purpose?”



I couldn’t understand his confusion. “No doubt the girl has been exhumed by someone looking to sodomise the body.” It to me seems a logical answer. “I would start with any unwed men or boys, particularly those known to have a queer countenance.”



Yet Silas shook his head. “You shan’t find the girl. Not in any house here, if it is protected by iron and rowan.”



My rage came quite suddenly, though in retrospect it had been simmering for some time. “Damn you Silas! This is neither the time nor place for these superstitions! A crime has been committed, we must catch and punish the offender, then lay that poor girl back to rest.”



“I told you to respect these people, their beliefs. If you had not intervened at the burial this could all have been avoided.”



“Silas,” I pleaded, “Please. We are civilised men, men of learning. Can you not see that there is a far clearer explanation? One that does not involve myth and the returning of the dead?”



Silas breathed deeply before he answered. “I understand what you say and why. But I know these people, have lived among them for months now. These are a timid people, not given to violence or lust. I knew the girl too. She was popular, and the village protective of her. No one would have hurt her, nor sought out her body.”



He sat quietly for some minutes.



“There are things unknown to man.” He said at last. “I have found too much evidence for that these past years. Too many witnesses, too many accounts, from Louisiana to the Carpathians, to your own research in Iberia. The dead return, without the knowledge or permission of god.”



I wanted to shout, to protest, but the darkness in his eyes and the sorrow in his voice left no room disagreement.



And that’s when the shouting began.",2,1753089333.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Today's weather forecast brings a mix of tropical vibes and surprises. The morning will greet you with clear skies and a gentle breeze, perfect for a beach stroll or a refreshing swim in the crystal-clear waters. Don't forget your sunglasses and sunscreen to shield yourself from the radiant sun.

As the day unfolds, expect some playful cloud cover to join the party. While the sun will still be in attendance, these clouds might provide a welcome break from its intense rays. It's a good idea to carry a light umbrella or a hat to stay shady and cool during your outdoor adventures. 

By late afternoon, a brief shower might make a guest appearance, so having a light rain jacket or seeking cover in a cozy café can be a delightful escape. Embrace the soothing sound of raindrops as they dance on rooftops, creating a tranquil ambiance perfect for a relaxing cup of local coffee.

Tonight, as the stars twinkle above, a light breeze will sweep through the town, making it ideal for a leisurely evening stroll or a romantic dinner by the sea. So, grab a light jacket to stay snug as you soak in the gentle night breeze.

There were even a few acorns scattered around like tiny wedding gifts. One squirrel was perched above them on a branch like it was officiating. I paused with my coffee, thinking: *Am I underdressed? Should I have brought a plus-one?*

Then one squirrel noticed me and froze like I'd interrupted the ceremony. I backed away slowly — didn’t want to ruin the first dance.

So I (20M) have been dating my SO (20F)  for 4 months now and we are long distance (about 4 hours from each other). So since we are long distance we call and text a lot however recently my GF has fallen into a deep depression and only told mw when I asked when she was not responding to my texts.

I have also been suffering with depression (reasons I do not wanna disclose) for the past month or so but my GF’s depression is mostly due to her work conditions.

A few weeks ago I made a really really stupid mistake. I was driving in the car when she called me while I was ordering a coffee from a cafe and I picked up the phone. She was venting about her uncle who passed away from an OD when she was really young.

Now my dumbass thought I could order the coffee while I can listen to her as I should have told her I was ordering coffee and couldn’t talk about such a sensitive topic right now. So I ordered the coffee while I was “listening” to her whej actuality my brain couldn’t process what she was saying. I then asked her what she said and then she declined on me, pissed off that I was unable to listen to her.

I called her again and she went off at me saying how insensitive I was for not listening to her when she was talking about her dead uncle and I felt really really extremely guilty. I still feel that guilt today and it keeps me up at night.

I genuinely apologized her and promised nothing like that would ever happen again. Ever since then ive felt a change in her demeanor everytime I facetimed her. She became less attached to me as she used to and less lovey dovey but still it seemed like she was over it.

Fast forward weeks later now my girlfriend texted me two days ago after not calling me at all for 6 days and confessed that she still has not gotten over the whole thing that happened. She apparently has been harboring resentment towards me for that slip up I did and has been purposely ignoring my texts and not willing to call me. She is going through a lot right now and she said she has been thinking about her uncle a lot recently too. 

I told her that I understand and that I will give her personal space for her mental health sake. I know im being selfish but my mental health has worsened because of all this too and has been stressing me out I can barely eat or sleep just thinking about how I caused so much distress for her. 

She is coming where I am soon because she has family here and that will be the only time I can see her in person but idk if she would want to see me I am in so much doubt right now. I have a feeling that she might end things with me I dont know what to do I feel so much guilt.

Nothing worked, my account was stuck at 500 followers, and my engagement was embarrassing.

Then I met another creator at a coffee shop who showed me their analytics. Their secret? They treated Instagram like a conversation, not a megaphone. Here's how I applied that mindset and finally saw real growth:

Stop Chasing Virality, Start Building Connections
Instead of posting and disappearing, I began spending 30 minutes each morning genuinely engaging with my ideal followers. Not just liking posts, leaving thoughtful comments on accounts slightly bigger than mine (10K-50K followers). Within two weeks, those creators started checking out my profile and engaging back.

The Magic of ""Micro-Engagement""
I noticed my best-performing posts all had one thing in common: they sparked quick reactions. So I started using:

""Double-tap if..."" captions

Simple polls in Stories (""Which should I post next? A or B?"")

These tiny interactions signaled to the algorithm that people cared, and my reach exploded.

When I Needed a Boost, I Got Smart About It
Around the 2K mark, growth slowed again. That's when I tried Viral Rabbi. not as a crutch, but as a way to get my content in front of real people in my niche. The increased visibility helped me break through that awful plateau.

Recently i was looking about masters programms in Europe and I found one that I’m really interested in and it’s in Bremen. I’m seriously thinking about it, however I have some questions I hoped you could answer or give me an overall idea. 
I saw that there are some student accommodation options that include rental rooms in a flat for about 300€/month which I think is really doable. Being a cat parent, the first thing that came to mind is what am I going to do with my cat, as I suppose that pets are not allowed in student residences. Is this true though, or will
I be able to bring my pet along? I’m also considering, if I have no other choice, to rent a room outside the university area where pets are allowed, but these are much more expensive and I don’t know if I could afford it. 
Which leads me to my next question, about jobs in Bremen. I do not speak German, apart from very specific basic stuff, however I’m proficient in English and I have 8 years of experience in food and coffee industry. Will I be able to find a job by speaking only English? This is the most important thing, as I don’t think I’ll be able to move to a new country whatsoever, if I can’t be secure about the work topic.
Thanks in advance guys! This masters is really exiting and I’m really looking forward to a new beginning in a new country, but those things are what are making me anxious about the whole thing.

## Key Features Analysis

The key to selecting a suitable replacement battery is to understand the core specifications that dictate its performance and compatibility with your Acer Chromebook Spin 13 CP713.

**Compatibility:** Ensuring the replacement battery is fully compatible with the Acer Chromebook Spin 13 CP713 model is paramount. Verify the battery model number matches the one recommended for your Chromebook, typically indicated on the original battery or in the device's user manual. Using an incompatible battery can lead to performance issues, charging problems, or even damage to your device.

**Battery Type:** Most replacement batteries for the CP713 utilize Lithium-ion (Li-ion) or Lithium-polymer (Li-Po) technology. Li-ion batteries are known for their energy density and relatively low cost, while Li-Po batteries are lighter and more flexible in terms of form factor. Both types offer good performance, but Li-Po batteries frequently enough have a slightly longer lifespan and better safety features.

**Voltage and Capacity:** the voltage of the replacement battery must match the original,typically around 11.4V or 11.55V. the capacity,measured in milliampere-hours (mAh) or Watt-hours (Wh),determines how long the Chromebook can operate on a single charge. A higher capacity battery generally provides longer runtime, but it may also be slightly larger or heavier. Common capacities for CP713 replacements range from 4000mAh to 4800mAh.

**Battery Cells and Quality:** The internal components of the battery, including the battery cells, are crucial for performance and safety. Reputable replacement batteries use high-quality cells from trusted manufacturers known for their stability and longevity. Lower-quality cells can degrade quickly, provide inconsistent power, or pose a safety risk. Look for batteries that have certifications such as CE, RoHS, or UL, indicating they meet certain safety and quality standards.

Key features to consider include:

*   Precise voltage and capacity matching original specifications
*   High-quality Li-ion or Li-Po battery cells
*   Built-in protection circuitry to prevent overcharging, overheating, and short circuits
*   Durable construction to withstand typical use and handling

This ensures smooth multitasking and responsiveness when handling demanding tasks.

**Cost Savings:** Purchasing a replacement battery is more economical than replacing the entire Chromebook. investing in a new battery extends the lifespan of your existing device, saving you the expense of buying a new one.

I know what each property do but when there are many properties  i dont know what they do together.

It's like you mix  differnt kind of soda water like Cola, Pepsi, Bubble tea, coffee together and you don't know the taste.  You know what I mean?

When confronting my mom asking why, she was upset by the fact I saw that chat, but not for the content of it. She threatened me with disinheriting me said some other horrible things.

\--------

I’ve always had a good relationship with my mom, but not with my brother. Family says he’s always been jealous of me for not giving our parents as much trouble as he did, so they treated me “better.” Our relationship is polite, but he constantly influences my mom against me. She’s scared of confronting him and fears being cut off from seeing his daughter, even though he needs her to babysit.

My boyfriend and I returned to my home country in April after years abroad. While apartment hunting, we stayed with my mom, partly to support her after my father’s death in January. But living with her has been a nightmare: she’d suddenly ignore us, claiming we don’t keep her company, despite our efforts: going out with her for a coffee daily, making plans in the weekends, etc. She has no hobbies or friends, just her sisters. She never wants to do anything in the weekends, and then she feels very down for it. I always try to listen to her to my best, despite she is very bitter and only talks ill about everyone around. My brother sees her for a coffee weekly.

We’ve now found an apartment 15 minutes drive away. When I told her, she didn’t seem happy. I only shared the news with my brother and sister-in-law, but she asked, “Did you tell your cousins?”—odd, since I’d just found out. **Context**: *my brother and my cousins are very close since they are the same age, have children, grew up together, etc.* Something smelled fishy, as these types of comments are usually coming from my brother's influence, so I checked her last messages with him. I know this was totally wrong, but somehow I felt something was going on.

My brother was trashing us for not telling the cousins right away, saying we’re “worse than X family member” (who's detached from the family) and that “our cousins don't deserve that treatment”. I have no problems with them, we just don't have much in common. They never ask me how things are going, nor do I. My mom replied that she’s “more unhappy than ever since we’re here” and complained that we’re “wearing her pans off” when cooking. My brother said, “thank God they’re leaving soon.”

I confronted my mom, saying she shouldn’t speak about us that way, and that I don’t even know what we did wrong. They’ve always judged me for living abroad, not wanting to stay in the hometown, or not being dependent on the family. I’ve never caused trouble, paid for my own college, and just wanted to live on my own terms. But I’ve always been forced to live up to their standards.

Now I’m not speaking to my mom, but living with her until the end of the month is unbearable. I feel like a bad son because they make me feel inadequate for not acting the way they want. They also criticized me for going to therapy to work on my self-esteem and family issues.

1m5dueu,https://www.reddit.com/r/soc2/comments/1m5dueu/automating_soc_2_compliance/,Automating SOC 2 compliance,"When we launched [SOCLY.io](http://SOCLY.io), compliance felt like a giant, slow-moving roadblock that stopped far too many great products from reaching the market. I can still remember a coffee-shop conversation with a SaaS founder who’d just lost a $500 K enterprise deal because the prospect wouldn’t budge without a SOC 2 Type II report. The pain was real; the solution, we believed, had to be different.

What we heard again and again:

* 6- to 12-month timelines that froze sales pipelines
* Consultant invoices running $50 K to $200 K
* Endless document requests no one fully understood
* Audits that failed at the last mile, resetting the clock

So we built [SOCLY.io](http://SOCLY.io) around one core idea: let software handle the repetitive work, and let seasoned compliance specialists handle the strategy.

Our platform automatically gathers evidence from AWS, Azure, GCP, Slack, GitHub, and dozens of other tools, while our consultants guide you through exactly what each framework (and each auditor) expects. The combination cuts the busywork while keeping you squarely on track.

What that looks like in numbers across 200+ customers:

Time to compliance

* SOC 2 Type I: 45 -60 days (industry average: 3–4 months)
* SOC 2 Type II: 3-month observation period - 180-200 days (industry average: 6–12 months)
* ISO 27001: 45–60 days (industry average: 6–12 months)
* GDPR attestation: 60–90 days (industry average: 6+ months)

Business impact

* One fintech client closed $2.8 M in enterprise contracts within 60 days of finishing SOC 2
* A healthcare startup cut compliance costs by 75% compared with “classic” consulting

Four lessons we’ve learned the hard way:

1. Automation without human review is risky. Every control still needs an expert eye before an auditor sees it.
2. Speed beats perfection. “Compliance-ready” quickly, then iterate.
3. Frameworks overlap. Nail SOC 2 once, and ISO 27001 or GDPR becomes far easier.
4. Auditors want crisp evidence, not essays. We focus on exactly what they’ll ask for—nothing more, nothing less.

The best feedback we get isn’t about faster audits or lower costs (though we’ll gladly take those). It’s hearing founders say, “You gave us our Fridays back.”

If SOC 2, ISO 27001, or GDPR is looming over your roadmap, drop a comment or DM. Happy to share what’s worked—and what definitely hasn’t—in getting companies certified without stalling their growth.

1m5dub1,https://v.redd.it/0fxrisk9z6ef1,I built a web app that turns YOU into custom stickers for every mood (free sticker on signup!) - would love your feedback,"# Hey Reddit! 👋

So I got tired of having less emotional range than a yellow emoji, and decided to do something about it. After months of coding and way too much coffee, I built **StickerStudio** \- a web app that creates identity-preserving custom stickers of YOU.

**What it does:**

* Upload one photo of yourself
* AI generates multiple sticker versions with different expressions/moods
* Keep your identity but get all the emotional range you deserve
* Use them anywhere - Discord, messaging apps, social media, etc.

**The best part:** Every sign-up gets a **completely free custom sticker** to try it out - no credit card, no catch, just wanted to let people experience it.

I've attached a walkthrough video showing the whole process (it's honestly pretty satisfying to watch your sticker pack come to life).

**Try it here:** [https://stickerstudio.art](https://stickerstudio.art)

This is still pretty early stage, so I'm really looking for honest feedback from the community:

* What works well? What doesn't?
* Any bugs or weird behavior?
* Features you'd want to see added?
* General thoughts on the concept?

You can drop feedback in the comments here or shoot me an email if you prefer - I read everything and actually implement suggestions.

Would genuinely appreciate if you gave it a quick try and let me know what you think. Building solo can be a bit of an echo chamber, so outside perspectives are gold.

Thanks for checking it out! 🙏

So since we are long distance we call and text a lot however recently my GF has fallen into a deep depression and only told mw when I asked when she was not responding to my texts.

I have also been suffering with depression (reasons I do not wanna disclose) for the past month or so but my GF’s depression is mostly due to her work conditions.

A few weeks ago I made a really really stupid mistake. I was driving in the car when she called me while I was ordering a coffee from a cafe and I picked up the phone. She was venting about her uncle who passed away from an OD when she was really young.

Now my dumbass thought I could order the coffee while I can listen to her as I should have told her I was ordering coffee and couldn’t talk about such a sensitive topic right now. So I ordered the coffee while I was “listening” to her whej actuality my brain couldn’t process what she was saying. I then asked her what she said and then she declined on me, pissed off that I was unable to listen to her.

I called her again and she went off at me saying how insensitive I was for not listening to her when she was talking about her dead uncle and I felt really really extremely guilty. I still feel that guilt today and it keeps me up at night.

I genuinely apologized her and promised nothing like that would ever happen again. Ever since then ive felt a change in her demeanor everytime I facetimed her. She became less attached to me as she used to and less lovey dovey but still it seemed like she was over it.

Fast forward weeks later now my girlfriend texted me two days ago after not calling me at all for 6 days and confessed that she still has not gotten over the whole thing that happened. She apparently has been harboring resentment towards me for that slip up I did and has been purposely ignoring my texts and not willing to call me. She is going through a lot right now and she said she has been thinking about her uncle a lot recently too. 

I told her that I understand and that I will give her personal space for her mental health sake. I know im being selfish but my mental health has worsened because of all this too and has been stressing me out I can barely eat or sleep just thinking about how I caused so much distress for her. 

She is coming where I am soon because she has family here and that will be the only time I can see her in person but idk if she would want to see me I am in so much doubt right now. I have a feeling that she might end things with me I dont know what to do I feel so much guilt.

Yesterday, everyone in our small group got coffee since December. I couldn’t help but feel the integral part of our group is missing. I texted his number today and found my texts not delivered. 


I don’t even know if he left a note. Sometimes I wonder if his ultra religious family have deleted or tossed it out of shame. They rushed his burial and placed him in a tucked away city & state he has no connections to. We couldn’t even make it unless we took a private plane.

After a while, I started to miss the Chemex more and more. There is something about the beauty of the device and the smell and nuance of the brew. When the V60 is pure chocolate, the Chemex is more like a delicate white chocolate (which I prefer). And the Chemex is so much more forgiving, the very first cup I brewed with my new one tasted head and shoulders above most V60 brews I had meticulously dialed in. I’m happy to be back in the camp!

1m5dqp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m5dqp2/we_stopped_for_gas_in_the_adirondeck_mountains/,We stopped for gas in the Adirondeck Mountains. What we saw was horrifying,"The Adirondack Northway is a stretch of Interstate 87 in New York that runs from Albany all the way to the Canadian border in Champlain. Its most rural sections begin after passing through Lake George in Warren County. The road narrows, curves more often, and exits become increasingly sparse. Cell service is almost nonexistent, and driving there can make you feel like you’re slipping out of time.

I was 17 and had just finished my junior year of high school. Around the same time, I finally received my graduated driver’s license. In other words, no more curfew. To celebrate, a few buddies and I decided to take a road trip through the Adirondacks, driving north for maybe an hour or so and then turning around and heading back, just for the hell of it. We’d grown up in Albany, only about an hour from the gateway to the mountains, so it felt like the perfect mini adventure. There were only four of us: me, a rising seinor; Cody, another rising seinor; Tom, a rising junior; and Sammy, a rising freshman we befriended a few weeks before at our high school’s welcoming orientation. While Sammy was the youngest, Tom was the most impulsive of the group. 

We left later than expected, around 6:30 PM. We drove for a while, taking in the views and gradually watching the sun dip below the horizon. 

Driving these roads during the day is relatively safe as long as you don’t speed on the curvy sections. During the night, however, it’s a completely different world. The road isn’t lit at all, and your only source of light besides your high beams are the minimal number of cars driving around you. It feels quite eerie, almost surreal. 

We were laughing, sharing dark jokes with each other, talking about girls we liked, sharing our disdain for AP classes, etc. It was all typical teen behavior. Everything was fun and games until the orange “Please Refuel” warning sign abruptly appeared right in front of me on the small screen behind the steering wheel. We only had 30 miles left. Sammy checked our location, and realized that by our own carelessness, we had traveled over 250 miles away from home for nearly 3 hours. 

Tom played it off as inconsequential as a knot began to form in my chest, while Sammy frantically began searching google maps for the nearest exit. Just as he was about to make a suggestion, a sign appeared on the right, advertising amenities right off of an exit 39S in a town called New France. 

The road connecting the town to the interstate ramp was nearly deserted, but that didn’t surprise us in the slightest. After all, we had traveled far north, well beyond where traffic thins and silence settles in. We made a right turn and began scanning the roadside for the Mobil station we’d seen advertised on the blue sign just before exiting the Northway.

After roughly three miles, a small—though unmistakably present—gas station appeared on our right. It had just two pumps, but since we were the only ones there, it hardly mattered. Beside the pumps stood a modest Mobil Mart, equipped with a single bathroom and a few shelves lined with the usual assortment of unhealthy snacks you’d expect to find at an average off-the-highway rest stop.
We were only there to get gas, but Tom—despite having already eaten an absurd amount at dinner—insisted on grabbing a variety of snacks he’d spotted through the window. Without a second thought, he headed inside to use the bathroom and make his purchases. Meanwhile, we finished pumping in no time and were finally ready to hit the road again, bracing ourselves for the inevitable lecture from our parents the following day.

Pacing ourselves, we all got back in the car and waited for Tom to return. Five minutes passed. Then ten. Then fifteen. Then twenty. Eventually, Sammy called him, only to be greeted by the overly cheesy voicemail message everyone knew and (for some reason) loved.

“Stop messing around and get back here,” he shouted into the phone before hanging up, clearly annoyed.

We gave it another ten minutes. When there was still no sign of Tom, I finally decided to go in and drag him out myself. 

The inside of the store was fairly typical—fluorescent lights humming overhead, shelves lined with snacks and travel essentials, a faint smell of coffee that had been sitting too long. What was unsettling, though, was the complete absence of a cashier. Even at night, there’s usually at least one person behind the counter, half-watching a small TV or scrolling through their phone. But here, the place was silent. Empty. Unmanned. There wasn’t even any music playing. 

Before I could think of how to reciprocate, the lights illuminating both the store and the gas station all shut off at once, plunging the other boys and I all into complete darkness. My heart began pounding as I called Tom’s name, over and over again without any response. 

I went back to the car to find my friends hyperventilating, begging for us to leave. They claimed that right after I had entered the store, a shadowy figure had followed me inside right before the power went out. Just as I was about to self-righteously assert how it would be completely wrong for us to leave Tom alone here deserted, we then heard a low, deep, but audible growl coming behind the store. 

Without thinking, I floored the accelerator and drove back to where I believed the interstate ramp was located. However, after driving for 15 minutes straight, it was still nowhere to be seen. I decided to pull over on the shoulder and conduct some research on where exactly we were. 

Using the one bar of service I had left, I tried to do some quick research on where exactly we were. Strangely, there were almost no references to any place called “New France” this far north—but we brushed it off, assuming the town was just too remote, too peripheral to have much of an online footprint.

Eventually, I pulled up a travel guide for I-87 and scrolled straight to the exit list. That’s when my stomach dropped.

There was no Exit 39S.

There was a 39N. Even a 39E. But no mention—anywhere—of a 39S, or of any town called New France.

Suddenly, the air felt colder. The mountains stood too still. And the trees… they seemed to be curving, ever so slightly, toward the road.

Before I could react, I saw a figure walking along the road. He was still a fair distance from the car, but close enough to make out some details.

I raised my phone and zoomed in with the camera—and that’s when the horror set in.

The figure was wearing Tom’s face.

Not just looked like him—wore his face.

But it wasn’t Tom. The gait was all wrong—stiff, almost puppet-like—and the figure was too tall, his limbs moving just a bit too mechanically, like someone mimicking a human walk without fully understanding how it worked.

Before I could react, it began to smile.

Not a friendly smile—no. This was something else entirely. A twisted, sinister grin, the kind you’d expect from a cartoon villain—exaggerated, wrong, almost theatrical.

But this wasn’t a cartoon. This was real—something pulled straight from what internet weirdos like to call the uncanny valley: a being that looked almost human, but not quite. Just close enough to fool your brain at first glance… and wrong enough to make your skin crawl the moment you really saw it.

Then I heard it.

A deafening scream—inhuman, guttural, and impossibly loud—ripped through the air as the thing started sprinting toward the car.
I slammed my foot on the gas, and the car lurched forward, tires screeching as we sped down the road—running straight over the Tom-facade in the process. There was a sickening thump, but I didn’t dare look back.

Inside the car, everyone was crying. Sobbing, really. We just wanted Tom back. We just wanted to be home—safe, in our own beds, pretending none of this had ever happened.

I kept driving, trying to focus, trying not to fall apart—until another realization hit me like ice water.

When I filled the tank earlier, I had 340 miles of range. I was sure of it.
Now? I was down to 90.
And we’d only been driving for thirty minutes.

I also realized that I distinctly remember having left the gas station at 10:30. The clock in my car still read that exact same time. 

Now, I was more desperate than ever to escape whatever we’d fallen into—but it was no longer just about the town. It was the mountains themselves.
It didn’t feel like we were lost anymore.

It felt like we’d crossed a threshold—stepped over some invisible border and entered into someone else’s dominion. And whatever ruled here didn’t care who we were. It only cared that we’d entered.

And now, it wasn’t letting go.

I had stopped driving. The gas gage was gradually getting closer and closer to E. 

That’s when we heard footsteps. We turned, and Tom at the edge of the clearing. But it wasn’t Tom. Not really.

He was tall now—too tall—his limbs stretched just a little too far, his shoulders crooked, like they’d been broken and never set right. His skin looked almost like skin, but waxy and pulled tight, as if his body had forgotten how to hold itself together. His face… God. It was Tom’s face, but wrong. The smile was too wide. The eyes were glassy, unfocused. It was like staring at a mannequin’s approximation of someone we had once loved.

He took a step forward and then spoke. 

“I asked it to let you go,” he said. “And it said yes. But I have to stay.”

He paused, his voice shaking, not from fear—but from something deeper. Surrender.

“Don’t come looking for me. And once I’m gone… leave. Immediately. Or it’ll change its mind.”

He looked at each of us, his face flickering like a worn projection trying to hold still.

“This place was never ours to enter. And I… I’m the price for our disrespect.”

He reached into his coat and handed us a folded map—old, creased, and slightly damp, as if it had passed through many hands before his. He didn’t explain it. He didn’t need to. Somehow, we understood: this was our way out.

Then, without another word, Tom turned. His movement was slow, almost mechanical, as if his body didn’t quite remember how to walk the way it once did. He trotted into the woods, his frame swallowed by the trees—and we never saw him again.

We unfolded the map under the dome light of the car. It showed roads none of us had ever heard of—no Waze results, no pins on Google Maps, nothing recognizable to any GPS system. But it was clear. Intentional. Marked with a path we could follow.

And so we did.

We followed the paper map down winding, narrow mountain roads that didn’t seem like they should exist—unmarked intersections, faded trail signs, cracked asphalt buried in leaves. But we kept going, and just when it felt like we might vanish into the trees again…

We saw it.

A dark blue sign. White letters. 87.

I didn’t even think. I slammed my foot on the gas and tore up the ramp, tires spitting gravel behind us as we surged back onto the freeway.

Back into the real world.

We got home very early in the morning. Our parents scolded for staying out too late, but our car privileges thankfully still remained intact. Nothing unusual.

However, what disturbed us most wasn’t what happened in the woods. It was what came after.

No one questioned Tom’s disappearance. No police reports. No missing posters. No calls from worried parents.

In fact, nobody seemed to remember Tom at all. Not classmates. Not teachers. Not even his own parents. When we mentioned his name, they just blinked—confused, polite, and distant, like we’d brought up a stranger.

It was as if Tom had been erased, not just from the world, but from memory itself. Like the price he paid wasn’t just his life, but the right to have ever been.

Even the photos on our phones had changed—group shots where his face was once clear now had empty space, or the edge of a jacket with no body attached. Text threads with his name were gone. Playlists he made disappeared.

Only we remembered. And even now, I can feel those memories starting to fade. Not all at once—but like a slow leak. Quiet. Inevitable.

The last we ever heard from him—or whatever took him—came a few weeks after it was all over.

It arrived in the mail. No return address. No postage stamp. Just a single envelope, aged and weather-warped, as if it had taken a long, unnatural route to reach us.

Inside was one line, handwritten in uneven ink:

“Stay out of our territory.”

Today I walk into a coffee shop. The barista is — how do I put this delicately — an actual Greek god with oat milk energy. Hair in a bun. Arm tattoos. Probably writes poetry for plants.

He says, “Hey! What can I get started for you?” and my brain goes:

Say something cool. Be mysterious. Be flirty.
I say:
“I like your hands.”
I. LIKE. YOUR. HANDS.
Who says that? WHO SAYS THAT??

He blinks. I double down. I panic harder and follow up with:
“They look… functional.”

FUNCTIONAL?? I just told this man his hands look like IKEA furniture.

At this point, we both want to die. But it gets worse.
He laughs (thank god?) and goes “Thanks? Do you want something to drink?”

And I — swear to god — trying to be funny, say:
“Only if it comes with your number.”

HE. STARTS. WRITING.

Turns out he thought I said “with your name.” He writes “Aaron” on the cup and smiles.
And then, because my brain is rotting from inside out, I say:
“Wow, Aaron. That’s what I’ll name our first child.”

SILENCE.
I am now fully proposing marriage over a cappuccino.

Long story short: I paid, didn’t take my change, and ran out of the store holding a cup like it was a live grenade.
I can never go back.

I'm a 36yo M, my wife is 32yo. I've been the main financial provider with a M-F 9-5 job with health benefits and 401k.  Her job is a contractor, so she has more flexibility with her schedule; but her job doesn't provide health benefits or 401k.  She take her paycheck and put it into a savings.  I've always thought that our contributions to each other were equal, not exactly 1 for 1 equal.  When we dated, she knew that I don't cook (I hate cooking, so much, I'd rather clean and maintain finances).  We took a pre-marital class and agreed with the topics covered and got a covenant marriage certificate.

This month is our 11th yr anniversary. Instead of celebrating, I'm reminded again (lost count) that I don't do enough or anything in the past for my family.   
  
There were 6 months of 2024 where we lived separated.  I didn't contribute to rent & related utilities for her & 2 adult siblings apartment unit.  Short story - their mom passed, their aunt sold their home, and I agreed to take them in.  They are both high functioning special needs.  I didn't go into detail of how long they would stay, because their mom just passed and I didn't want to make it worse.  At year 1, I started asking about her siblings moving out.  At year 2, I suggested we can even rent a unit within same complex.  At 2.5 years, I told her that I found a unit that was in the same complex.  I applied on 2 different occasions.  She said no, and I cancelled.  We had Christian counseling and Bible study group leaders pray for us.   I was burnt out from helping her adult siblings (we took turns dropping/picking each off/picking them up in morning or past midnight).   This impacted our sleep and my career certification was delayed until mid 2024 (my classmates achieved this far sooner than I did and it impacted my mental health).  I also didn't feel comfortable living with her brother and sister.  I wanted more privacy for dates, discussion and intimacy.  She didn't believe that I was uncomfortable living with her sister.

By the end of 2.5 years of them living with us, I got fed up and found a 3rd apartment unit that was affordable for out careers ($1,500) vs ($2,500).  Again, she said no.  I disagreed and signed the lease.  I gave her an option to live at the new apartment, and we would still contribute to her siblings' rent, she said no.  So she threw her wedding ring at the ground towards me, said it's over, and told me to get out.  So I left and moved out.  My wife chose to stay with her siblings and renewed the lease.    
  
Satan tempted me, and I fell for it and went on a coffee date with another woman the next week after I left.  But that weekend's sermon convicted me to tell her, and she got upset.  Which is understandable.    
  
Soon 1 month after I left/their lease renewal.  Her siblings told her that they wanted to move out and live independently.  I told my wife that we could have avoided all of this with what I had suggested.

6 months later, I chose to move back with her and siblings (kind of, I travelled back and forth from my parents).  During the 6 months of separation, we still had arguments, including things being ""equal."" So I told my wife, then pay the bills (rent, groceries, utilities, whatever that I did for the family.  She complained about it, so she paid for rent and utilities for her and siblings' apartment, while I continued to do the rest.

Anyway, at the beginning of 2025, her siblings moved to another unit and we live 10-15 minutes away.  I felt our marriage was better, more privacy and intimacy.  And it turns out that her adult siblings were more independent than my wife thought they could be.  But I was wrong, we would have moments of ""peace,"" but when she had her arguments, it is on the brink of divorce.  She would scream at the top of her lungs.  I used to argue even louder, but she would outdo me and scream even higher, so I learned to leave the room and put my head phones on. She would get so angry with her arguments, I had a short period where I feared her more than God.  I know that I shouldn't be, but she is frightening.

So now, it's July and it's the month of our 11 year anniversary, and within 2 weeks time, she repeatedly tells me that I haven't done anything for the family in the past.  She also told a mutual acquaintance/co-worker that I don't do anything.    
  
I had a thought and checked my CC statements. Unfortunately, only the last 6 years is available. Below are my contributions to the family (to her and our kid).

**Financial**

* Sam’s club/Costco/Groceries (paying and pick up).
* Restaurants
* Movie dates
* Airplane tickets

* Dental, Vision, Medical

* Water Bill

* All furniture, and small appliances
* Car insurance
* Apartment insurance
* Transportation/Relocation
* Car maintenance
* All car tint
* Daycare/child-care (mixed contribution)

**Non-financial**

* House chores/cleaning (25% 2014-2023), (75% 2024) (80% 2025)
* Ready-made meals (2014-2024), She initially asked that the least that I could do for her is to heat her any easy meal, but that quickly changed to meal prep every day.  I've never rejected her food nor left it out without eating.  Yet, when I prepped her meal, she would say, she's not hungry or she'll eat later, but then gets too tired to eat. 
* Cooking (She asked me make meals from scratch a month ago, I had a meal for each day, but then realized that there would be left overs and she didn't want to eat them, so they would go spoiled because I could not finish them).

I'm not sure if I should bring up seeing a 3rd couples marriage counselor. We each saw our individual counselor in the past year or two.  My Christian friends don't really provide much help with advice.  My men's Bible study group suggest that she gets grief counseling for her mom's passing, and we should see a couples counselor again.  And if it doesn't work out, then I can say that I tried.

While I'm not perfect, I have to tell myself that I am not a dead-beat dad or husband.  Or am I really a dead-beat dad and husband?

I'm not sure if asking for prayers will help.  I know God has good plans... in his own time.",2,1753087693.0,TrueChristian,3,0.76,False

The more complex a machine is, the more things can break. My focus was on durability, easy maintenance, and good coffee. De’Longhi offers many spare parts and is known for long-lasting machines. I ruled out brands like Philips – in my opinion, their entry-level machines don’t match De’Longhi’s taste quality.

At the time of purchase, the Magnifica Start 220.80.SB and the Magnifica Evo 290.51.B were on sale. I chose the 290 because it’s from a newer, more refined series, and I hoped for more robust technology.

How I drink my coffee and latte:
I don’t like sour filter coffee and I have a sensitive stomach. I prefer rich flavors – sweet, nutty, or chocolatey. I drink my coffee with milk – sweet-tasting, but without sugar. I use lactose-free 3.5% milk mixed 80/20 with 10% barista milk.
Pure 10% milk creates bad foam and can harm the milk system – that’s why I mix it.

The 290.51.B is one step above the basic models 290.21.B and 290.22.B – the biggest difference: automatic milk frothing (LatteCrema system).
The models 290.61 and 290.81 offer a more premium design and slightly easier controls, but are technically almost the same as the 290.51.B.

Advice:
More expensive De’Longhi machines have Bean Adapt Technology, which adjusts settings automatically to your beans. My machine doesn’t have that – I use ChatGPT to manually find the best settings.

Conclusion:
If you’re looking for a simple and easy-to-use machine, I can recommend this one. It and similar models are often on sale – sometimes for as low as €330. In that case, the value for money is hard to beat.
It’s ideal for people who don’t want fancy features but still want to adjust the bean strength (1–3) and the grind level (13 steps). For most people, that’s more than enough.",1,1753087283.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

He always looked at me, stared at me. Even asked my boss about my relationship status. Sometimes he came up to me for a chat. I knew he was interested, however, I was in a relationship at a time. My partner died one year ago from addiction and I have been single since.

So this guy stopped visiting us, and I randomly just thought about him like 3 weeks ago.  
I got his number, and called him to ask about something credit score related since he works in finance industry.  
We chatted, he asked about my love life, I told him I'm single since my partner died, he told me he is getting divorced, but spending time with his son (12 years old) and that he will be in my town so we can meet.

It was a light, sweet conversation, obviously there was some sort of attraction on both ends, he seemed kinda shy.

I called him last Monday around 8 PM to ask about his weekend, he called me on Tuesday, we chatted again, about his work, his plans with his son. He told me to go and get a grab a coffee with just the two of us on Sunday(yesterday) since I mentioned I have a birthday. I told him that of course, I want to meet him, I'm open. He told me he wants to see me too.

He told me he has to go because he has a meeting at work. Then he texted me saying that he ""got shy"" and that he got nervous. I told him it's ok. He asked me if I'm seeing anyone recently, because he doesn't want to be inappriopriate. I told him I'm single, that I want to get to know him better.

On the same day, he calls me around 8 PM, he's outside of some restaurant with the coworkers on the lunch. We talk for 1 hour. He says he is ""crazy over me"", that he finds me very attractive, that he was always asking my boss about me, asked for my number. He told me if I'm open to travel with him for 3 days somewhere with my dog?(I have a sweet shihtzu) I say of course I would love that. He then proceeds to tell me ""Do we have to wait til Sunday? I have a hotel booked til Thursday,but I can leave earlier."" I told him that we can meet earlier of course. He told me we can meet tommorow (Wednesday), that he will stay in a hotel, we will go to a dinner.

 We never had a chance to talk for so long, or get to know each other better, so I thought its a good opportunity. He also stated that he thinks about me, he even told me which jeans I wore when he visited, our which shoes I wore. Also told me I once got into some black car and drove off and that he drove behind me but he couldn't find me. (I don't remember that, I didn't know about that)

This conversation took place on Tuesday. On Wednesday, I texted him to confirm the meeting. The message was marked as green, no iMessage sent. I thought he is in a train and out of signal.  
The phone was ""out of signal"" for the whole day. I think this phone number is his private, from what I know. I was surprised.

Thursday, phone out of signal again.

Friday, out of signal. I call him from different number and he picks up after some time. Tells me he has a ""huge accident in his house and that he will call me later, also asks if we can meet'. Doesn't call me again.

Saturday. He calls me by mistake (on my second number, he didn't save it) saying that he is ""standing under number 20"" (I think he meant the door number or apartment number) I say which 20??? what???? and he tells me - Oh my god, I'm sorry.

Hangs up. His phone is out of signal/ out of reach for majority of the days. Sometimes he turns the phone on again so there is a signal but for short period of time.

Sunday. Phone was turned off for the whole day.

I know that none of you knows WHY he's doing what he's doing. But he seemed genuinely interested in me. He really seemed honest and shy about conversation and stuff.

Also, I think thats the big factor in understanding the story - he once visited our company (3 years ago) while being ...under some sort of substance to say at least. Also I found his tiktok account (no videos) and a lot of accounts about drug recovery are being followed by him.

I don't know if he's clean. I know nothing about it. We didn't talk about it. This might be his past but I just think it's worth mentioning. He also told me he is attending therapy because he used to have depression due to divorce.

I know y'all will say to stay away from him, but I genuinely don't know why is he ghosting me like this.  
I think the reasons might be:  
\- he is on a bender and doesn't know what's going on  
\- he knows he is an addict and ""doesnt want to hurt me""  
\- or he is clean from any substances and the reasons is unknown to me still   
Also when I told him I asked someone for his number, he told me that he was happy to give his number to this person to give it to me, and even if I didnt call him, he would ask for mine. 

 I had birthday yesterday and I wasnt even present or happy with my family because this situation made me feel so sad. I was so hopeful that we will spend time together.

1m5dkn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/1m5dkn9/what_we_learned_after_launching_a_slacknative/,What we learned after launching a Slack-native polling feature (and how teams are using it),"We recently launched a Polls feature in Slack to help teams collect quick async input without switching tools. Now that over 20k polls have been created, some patterns are starting to emerge — and I’d love to hear how others here are handling team feedback and engagement in Slack.

A few things stood out:

* Average participation rate across these polls has been 51%, which is well above typical online survey benchmarks (usually around 20–33%).
* Teams are using polls for more than just scheduling — we’re seeing async prompts like:
   * “How confident are we feeling heading into this launch?”
   * “What’s your biggest blocker this week?”
   * “Would you prefer fewer meetings next sprint?”

It seems like native, in-channel polling keeps participation high — no new tabs, no logins, just a quick nudge in Slack and responses roll in.

Fun fact: this uptake helped make Geekbot, the tool we built for async check-ins, one of the top polling apps on Slack for a while. That was never the goal — we just wanted to simplify async collaboration and feedback loops — but it’s been exciting to see how teams have used it.

For example, if you’re in HR or PeopleOps and want to pulse-check something across departments, it’s a 5-second job to grab a ready-made template, tweak the wording, and schedule it. By the time your coffee’s ready, you’ve got charts, organized replies, and next steps without pinging people one by one. Or if you’re an engineer prepping for a retro — drop in a quick poll to collect what went well, what didn’t, and what needs improvement. You’ve got clear patterns by the time the team logs on — no more blank stares on a Miro board.

Curious how others are doing this:

Are you using async check-ins or Slack polls for engagement?

Any creative use cases or learnings worth sharing?

Why is he doing that?,"So there is this guy who I met like 4 years ago. He came to my job because our companies cooperated from time to time. He visited like once a month or something. He always looked at me, stared at me. Even asked my boss about my relationship status. Sometimes he came up to me for a chat. I knew he was interested, however, I was in a relationship at a time. My partner died one year ago from addiction and I have been single since.

So this guy stopped visiting us, and I randomly just thought about him like 3 weeks ago.  
I got his number, and called him to ask about something credit score related since he works in finance industry.  
We chatted, he asked about my love life, I told him I'm single since my partner died, he told me he is getting divorced, but spending time with his son (12 years old) and that he will be in my town so we can meet.

It was a light, sweet conversation, obviously there was some sort of attraction on both ends, he seemed kinda shy.

I called him last Monday around 8 PM to ask about his weekend, he called me on Tuesday, we chatted again, about his work, his plans with his son. He told me to go and get a grab a coffee with just the two of us on Sunday(yesterday) since I mentioned I have a birthday. I told him that of course, I want to meet him, I'm open.

No matter what I tried, I remained stuck living paycheck to paycheck. Everything changed when I focused on reprogramming my subconscious beliefs about wealth. I started a nightly routine of writing gratitude statements for every bit of money that came in (even a $5 discount or a free coffee—I would write, ""Thank you for this abundance!""). I also used guided ""wealth visualization"" every evening (imagining my future self enjoying financial freedom without worries). After about a month, I noticed I no longer had that knot in my stomach when paying bills. In fact, I started to feel abundant. Then crazy things started to happen—I received a really great job offer (with double the salary I had before). It felt almost magical, but I know it came from within: by removing my deep-seated belief that ""there’s never enough,"" I made room for more than enough. An important point: if you’re struggling to manifest money, try addressing your inner beliefs first. You really need to believe you’re worthy and capable of handling abundance.

No computers, no genius gimmicks, just old fashion police work and coffee, and a lot of time with the two brothers in the squad car. 

Then I realized no one would understand the reference, so I thought up ""The Faks Of Life"", the Faks, by way of an Unc investment gone wrong, come to own an all girls boarding school. As they help mold these young women and prepare then for college or the trades, they impart their brand of wisdom, ensuring their legacy lives on. And sometimes there's a very special episode that takes on a prickly problem facing our current society.

These shows should be categorized as sci-fi, because they take place in a universe where the Faks would be trusted with guns or being alone with young women.

1m5dbw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m5dbw5/in_my_previous_life_i_had_three_husbands/,"In my previous life, I had three husbands","In my previous life, I had three husbands—but none of them loved me. Their hearts belonged to the same woman: Janet Jameson, the butler's daughter.  
Even their dying words were the same: Don't marry me.  
So in this life, I would not waste my time on anyone who does not truly want me.  
""If I must marry for the sake of the family, I choose Samuel Lockwood,"" I told my parents.  
""Samuel? Do you mean the illegitimate son from the northern branch of the Lockwood family? Why him all of a sudden?"" they asked, stunned.  
Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and dominated the business world like no one else.  
If this marriage was about alliances and power, then I would make it count.  
Samuel was the kind of man who offered nothing but upside.  
As for love? I had stopped hoping for that.  
\*\*\*  
Emma Dalton was reborn on the day her parents laid out profiles of the eldest sons from the three top families in Chicago, asking her to choose one to marry.  
Without hesitation, she shook her head. ""I'm not picking any of them.""  
Her parents, Brent and Cassandra, were shocked. ""Why not?""  
""Because...""  
Her heart throbbed painfully. She had been married to all three of them in her last life.  
In the upper circles, everyone knew the Thompson, Vegara, Vanderpool, and Dalton families were the four powerhouses of Chicago.  
Emma, the only daughter among the four, had become the most sought-after bride—each of the other three families wanted to marry into the Dalton family.  
In her previous life, when she was choosing her marriage partner for the first time, she chose Isaac Thompson, and she happily thought that she would be happy for the rest of her life.  
However, after they got married, he was not at home for 364 out of 365 days a year, not only making her a laughing stock in the circle but also dying in a chain car accident while trying to protect Janet.  
Emma had been widowed at a young age, losing her first husband and spending three years alone before being remarried to Anthony Vegara—another match arranged by her family.  
However, Anthony never cared about the marriage. To him, Emma meant nothing. In their second year together, he died in a reckless racing accident—all for Janet.  
Because of this, people started calling Emma a husband-killer. It was not until she turned 30 that she married Mateo Vanderpool.  
This time, their marriage was quiet and respectful. They lived peacefully, growing old together—until Mateo fell ill. Before he died, he held her hand and whispered his final wish.  
""Emma, if there's another life, please don't marry me. I just want to be with Janet.""  
It was then Emma realized that all of them had loved Janet.  
That was why, before they each died, their last words were always the same, ""Don't choose me for marriage.""  
Janet was just the daughter of the Dalton family's butler. She was neither beautiful nor talented. All she knew how to do was act fragile and sweet.  
Emma never understood how she lost to someone like that. She never knew why the men loved Janet so much that they were even willing to marry Emma just to protect Janet from being used by the family.  
Emma spent her whole life watching them love Janet, and her whole life learning one simple truth.  
She, Emma Dalton, was never anyone's supporting role.  
She did not want someone who did not want her.  
So in this life, she did not pick any of the same men. Instead, she gave her parents a new answer.  
""If I'm getting married, I only want Samuel from the Lockwood family.""  
Brent and Cassandra were stunned.  
""Samuel? The illegitimate son of the Lockwoods in New York? Why would you want to marry him all of a sudden?""  
Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and held massive sway in the business world.  
If this marriage was for the family's benefit, then Emma needed to get the most out of it.  
Samuel was a man who came with nothing but advantages.  
As for love? She had stopped hoping for that.  
Even though Brent and Cassandra were strongly opposed at first, Emma racked her brain to come up with reason after reason.  
""New York's economy is booming, and the Lockwood Group is the most influential family there. Haven't you always wanted to break into the New York market but had to back off because we didn't have a foothold? Marrying Samuel is our chance. You've even said it yourselves—Samuel is ambitious, sharp, and ruthless. A man like that is bound to achieve great things.""  
Emma's analysis was solid, and they could not find any flaw in her logic.  
After weighing the pros and cons, they finally decided to support her choice. They took the initiative to contact the Lockwood family and finalize the engagement.  
""Emma, both families have come to an agreement. The wedding will be held in half a month.""  
When she heard that, Emma finally felt a bit of relief settle in her chest.  
Time was tight, so Brent and Cassandra hurried to prepare the dowry.  
Emma sat alone on the couch, her mind a swirl of thoughts and emotions all tangled up.  
Just then, footsteps sounded at the door.  
Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo stepped inside, their eyes immediately landing on her.  
""Emma, who did you choose to marry?""  
They asked in unison, their faces full of tension and seriousness. For a moment, Emma was dazed.  
The four of them had grown up together. They were childhood friends who were practically inseparable.  
Those three had always treated her like a princess and spoiled her endlessly.  
Whatever she wanted, they gave it to her. Whenever she was upset, they comforted her, and whenever she was bullied, they stood up for her first.  
Back then, she truly believed that it was because they cared deeply.  
In her previous life, when they rushed in with those same questions, she had thought it was because they were excited to be chosen.  
Now, she saw it clearly. They were not hoping to be picked, and that was what those expressions meant.  
That realization made her heartache. Her chest felt tight as if she could not breathe.  
After a long silence, she finally composed herself, then replied in a low, raspy voice.  
""In 15 days, you'll know who I chose.""  
Emma did not budge, still keeping her answer to herself. The three of them were starting to get impatient, clearly eager to press her for more.  
However, before she could say anything else, her phone rang.  
""Emma, Janet was badly hurt in an accident and she's in the hospital right now. But there aren't any available wards. Can you help us?"" The tearful voice of the butler, Horace Jameson, trembled through the speaker.  
Before Emma could even react, Isaac grabbed the phone from her, his tone tight with concern.  
""Which hospital?""  
There was a pause on the other end. Then, choking on emotion, Horace named the hospital.  
Isaac hung up immediately, turned to Emma, and said, ""Don't worry about it, Emma. I'll handle the hospital situation. It's nothing.""  
Without missing a beat, Anthony and Mateo also jumped in.  
""The hospital's owned by the Vegara family. I'll talk to the director myself. Just stay home and rest, Emma.""  
""I know some top-tier specialists. I'll reach out to them, so you don't need to worry.""  
They all claimed they were doing it for her, but Emma knew the truth—they were all just looking for excuses to rush to Janet's side.  
How had she missed it before? Their feelings had been right in front of her the whole time.  
As she watched their backs disappear out the door, Emma gave a faint, bitter smile.  
Then she turned away, walked back to her room, and quietly began packing everything related to them.  
By the time she finished, night had fallen. She picked up her phone and saw Janet's newest post on her feed.  
""Another day of being doted on by the three powerful men.""  
Attached was a selfie from the VIP ward.  
She was sipping Mateo's signature soup while Isaac's watch sat neatly on the bedside table. Meanwhile, Anthony's jacket was draped over the chair beside her.  
Emma tapped ""Like"" on the post, then looked at the three boxes she had just packed.  
Each box held the gift she had received at 18—one from Isaac's father, one from Anthony's mother, and one from Mateo's grandfather. All three were heirlooms from the three families.  
Whichever one she chose to keep would symbolize her family's decision on which family to form a marriage alliance with.  
Now, her marriage had already been decided and it was time to give her an answer.  
Emma called a courier to her home and handed the three boxes to him.  
""Please mail these out separately—15 days from today.""

\# Chapter 2  
After mailing out the packages, Emma tossed everything she had just organized straight into the trash.  
The jewelry and designer bags gifted by Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo, the old videos and photos from their time together, even the custom suits she had designed for them with care...  
All of it—every memory tied to them—was now part of the past, discarded without hesitation.  
In this life, Emma was not going to repeat her old mistakes.  
She poured all her focus into preparing for the wedding, tuning out the world outside her own little bubble.  
After a few hectic days of picking out her dress and accessories, she finally came home—only to find Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo all fussing over Janet.  
One was adjusting the AC temperature, another gently fanning a bowl of soup to cool it down, and the third was draping a blanket over her, asking how she was feeling with sincere concern.  
Watching Janet being doted on like royalty, Emma could not help but smile bitterly to herself.  
The affection was so obvious now, how had she missed it before?  
The ache in her chest tightened, leaving her feeling drained and a little hollow.  
Right then, Janet noticed her standing at the door. Startled like a timid bird, Janet quickly got to her feet, her expression filled with fear and deference.  
""Emma, you're back! I'll go heat up some water and get dinner started. Please give me a moment.""  
She started to rise, but Isaac gently held her down.  
""Janet's still recovering. There are plenty of other staff around. Emma, just ask someone else to handle it.""  
Anthony and Mateo chimed in as well. ""She's still pretty injured. Emma, just let her rest.""  
""If you're really short on help, we can always transfer more staff. There's no need for Janet to be doing chores in her condition.""  
Since the moment she walked in, Emma had said nothing—yet she was being lectured like she'd done something wrong.  
She let out a quiet breath and narrowed her eyes slightly. ""I know she's the daughter of our butler, not our maid. And I've never forced her to do anything. But since you all care about her so much, maybe you should just take her home and look after her yourselves. That way, you don't have to worry so much.""  
Janet's eyes widened in shock and she immediately dropped to her knees.  
""Emma, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have slacked off just because I'm sick. Please don't drive me and my dad away. I'll get up right now and get to work.""  
Her knee hit the ground hard and they bruised instantly. Her tears streamed down her face like rain, looking like she had been deeply wronged.  
The moment her tears started falling, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo's expressions darkened.  
The three of them rushed to help Janet up, shielding her behind them as they all turned to Emma, their voices tinged with frustration.  
""Janet didn't do anything wrong. Why are you trying to kick her out for no reason? Do you really have to bully her like this?""  
""She's still hurt and was trying to heat your water and make you dinner. Not only do you not care about her condition, but you're also forcing her to leave. Do you have no heart at all?""  
""She's hurt even worse now. If anything happens to her later because of this, are you just going to pretend it's nothing? Will you only be satisfied if she completely breaks down?""  
Watching them so naturally jump to defend Janet, Emma's expression turned colder by the second.  
""I didn't do anything except suggest that you take her home if you're that worried. That's considered bullying now? In your eyes, am I really that unreasonable and difficult? So no matter what happens, she's the victim and I'm the one to blame?""  
Her words brought silence crashing down on the room.  
Seeing their frozen expressions, Emma felt a wave of helplessness wash over her.  
She did not want to say anything more. Without another word, she turned and walked back to her bedroom.  
Just as she had finally calmed down, there was a knock at the door.  
Janet came in timidly, holding a cup of coffee. ""I'm sorry, Emma. Please don't be angry at them. They only spoke like that because they were too worried about me. It's my fault you ended up fighting. If you need someone to blame, blame me.""  
Having lived through this once already, Emma knew exactly what Janet was trying to do. She would put on a pitiful act and stir the pot.  
""Leave the coffee and get out.""  
Emma's voice was cold and detached. Hearing that, Janet looked even more wronged, but she did not dare push back.  
Then, she pretended to fumble and spilled the entire cup of coffee.  
The hot liquid splashed onto Emma, scalding her skin until it turned red and blistered.  
Emma let out a hiss of pain and instinctively shoved Janet's helping hand away.  
Janet took the chance to stumble backward dramatically, slamming her head against the edge of the table. A bloody gash instantly opened on her forehead.  
Her sharp cries filled the entire villa.  
Before Emma could even react, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo burst through the door.  
Seeing Janet unconscious on the floor with blood running down her head, the three of them instantly panicked.  
Anthony shoved past Emma without hesitation. Isaac rushed forward and scooped Janet into his arms, while Mateo pressed down on the wound to stop the bleeding.  
They hurried off, completely focused on protecting Janet. No one even noticed Emma had stumbled into the glass display case.  
Shards flew everywhere as the glass shattered, slicing into her skin and leaving her covered in cuts.  
Blood soaked through her clothes. Her face twisted in pain, and her whole body trembled uncontrollably.  
Watching their figures disappear down the hall, Emma could not hold back her tears any longer.  
Her heart ached so much it felt like she could not breathe. She bit down hard on her lip to keep from sobbing out loud.  
Only one final thought echoed in her mind: She had to walk away from their world for good. Never again would she let herself be part of it.

\# Chapter 3  
After pushing through the pain and getting her wounds treated at the hospital, Emma took the prescription and headed to the pharmacy window—only to spot a few familiar figures outside the next ward.  
Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo were standing outside Janet's room, their faces full of worry and heartache.  
""I've said it before, Janet's too soft. If she stays there, she's just going to keep suffering. Once the marriage is finalized, I'll find a way to get her out, no matter what. I don't want her to go through this anymore.""  
""Now that our parents know Janet's the one we really care about, we have to make sure she's protected. So no matter who Emma chooses, that guy has to accept the marriage and go along with it. That's the only way the family won't come after Janet.""  
Emma stood there quietly, listening to every word, and suddenly felt her chest tighten.  
So this was why they had gone along with the marriage in the previous life even when they clearly did not want to.  
They thought they were protecting someone they loved even if it meant sacrificing their own happiness.  
Yet, in doing so, they wrecked hers.  
She looked down and laughed bitterly, tears blurring her vision.  
They could relax this time as no one would have to sacrifice anything.  
Once she collected herself, she wiped away her tears and turned to leave—only for her phone alarm to go off suddenly.  
The sharp ringtone startled the three men. When they opened the door and saw her standing there, they all froze in surprise.  
""You're here? Are you planning to apologize to Janet?""  
""How much did you hear just now?""  
""What's with all those injuries? What happened to you?""  
They all spoke at once, questions flying at her.  
Emma answered calmly, one by one. ""I got hurt because you pushed me aside to get to Janet. I came here to get treatment, not to apologize. She spilled the hot coffee on me first, and I pushed her away. Running into you here was just a coincidence.""  
Hearing her words, the three men fell silent, their expressions shifting into something more complicated.  
After a moment, Anthony was the first to speak.  
""Janet didn't mean to spill the coffee. She's still recovering, so her hands are weak. Don't be mad at her. When we walked in and saw all that blood, we thought it was serious. That's why we lost it. I'm sorry.""  
Isaac also took a breath and calmed down. ""We weren't trying to blame you earlier. We just felt bad for Janet, so we said a few things on her behalf.""  
""Yeah,"" Mateo added, ""we all grew up together. You've always been the one who mattered most to us. Have you thought about the marriage?""  
As soon as he asked, the three of them stared at Emma, clearly nervous about her response.  
Emma looked at them, her expression unreadable. After what she had just overheard, all she felt was a bitter irony.  
""Thought it through?"" She gave a cold smile. ""I... ""  
Before she could finish, a sudden loud beeping came from the monitor in Janet's room.  
Their faces changed instantly, and they all rushed back in to check. Medical staff poured into the ward right after them.  
""The patient's kidneys were already compromised after the second trauma,"" a doctor explained urgently. ""We didn't catch it in time and administered the wrong medication. It's led to acute kidney failure. Her condition is very serious now!""  
Isaac's face went pale, his eyes red with panic.  
""How could you mess this up? She's still so young! If you ruin her life because of negligence, can you live with that?""  
Anthony grabbed the doctor by the collar and barked furiously, ""You've got half an hour. I want a treatment plan that guarantees results. If anything happens to her, you'll answer for it.""  
Mateo was already on the phone, frantically calling every contact he had.  
""Dr. Zimmerman, you're the best nephrologist in the country. Please, this is urgent. I need your help to save someone extremely important. Where are you now? I'll send my secretary to pick you up right away.""  
The whole ward was in chaos. Everyone was on edge, trying everything they could for Janet.  
Soon, the hospital pulled together a special team and quickly outlined the only viable solution.  
""She needs a kidney transplant as soon as possible,"" one specialist explained. ""But finding the right donor will take time. And the longer we wait, the higher the risk to her life.""

\# Chapter 4  
After hearing the diagnosis, the three men did not hesitate for a second and immediately went to get tested for a match.  
The results came out quickly and Isaac was a compatible donor.  
Without a word, he picked up the consent form the doctor handed over, signed it on the spot, and walked straight into the operating room.  
Time ticked by slowly, and just as everyone was getting more and more anxious, a new problem cropped up.  
A nurse burst out of the OR in a panic, her voice urgent.  
""The hospital's blood bank is running low. The patient is hemorrhaging and needs a large amount of blood, fast!""  
Anthony and Mateo, who had been waiting nearby, immediately rolled up their sleeves.  
""We have the same blood type as Janet. Take our blood!""  
""But her condition is critical, and the two of you alone won't be enough. You need to call more donors... ""  
""There's no time,"" Anthony interrupted. ""The two of us will do. Take as much as you need. Just save her!""  
The nurse had no choice but to rush them into the transfusion room.  
The red light outside the OR blinked nonstop, making Emma feel dizzy.  
She had seen everything—the panic, the surgery, and the blood donation. Right now, her mind was completely blank.  
In her previous life, when Isaac and Anthony died for Janet, she had not been there. She only learned about it afterward, buried in grief and confusion, unable to understand why they would risk everything for Janet.  
However, after everything that happened, she finally understood—they loved Janet so much that they were willing to give up everything for her.  
Be it marriage or their lives, they never thought twice, always putting her first no matter the cost.  
So, no, she could never compete with Janet.  
Yet, it did not matter anymore because this time, Emma had already decided to let go. She would step out of their tangled love story once and for all.  
Eventually, the OR light went off, and the doctor came out, wiping sweat from his brow.  
""Are you the family? The surgery was a success, so she'll wake up soon. However, the kidney donor needs monitoring in the ICU, and the two who donated blood passed out from blood loss. Can you handle taking care of four people on your own?""  
Emma shook her head, parted her dry lips, and spoke with a hoarse voice.  
""I have nothing to do with the four of them, but I can help contact their families. They should be here soon.""  
After saying that, she sent messages to the Thompson, Vegara, and Vanderpool families, as well as to Horace, briefly explaining the situation.  
She turned to leave, only to catch whispers from a few nearby nurses.  
""She's not related? I thought she was the wife of one of those three handsome guys!""  
""How could she be? If your husband risked his life for another woman, would you be okay with that? I bet those three are all in love with that girl. Why else would they be so desperate to save her?""  
Emma listened in silence, her lips curving into a faint, bitter smile.  
The nurses were right—Janet had always been the one whom the three men loved.  
And Emma would never be their wife again.  
Dragging her bruised and aching body back home, Emma found her parents waiting in the living room.  
When Brent and Cassandra saw the wounds on her body, their brows furrowed in concern. Not wanting them to worry, she quickly came up with a simple excuse.  
Hearing that her injuries were not serious and would heal soon, they finally relaxed and handed her a box.  
""This is the marriage token from the Lockwood family. Keep it safe. Samuel has already received the one we sent him.""  
""Just now, Mr. Thompson, Mrs. Vegara, and Mateo's grandfather all called to ask about the marriage and even mentioned Janet. They said the three boys are just too softhearted, but you're the one they truly care about. We didn't really know how to respond, and it's hard to judge the situation. You're old enough now to make your own choices. Your father and I won't interfere.""  
Emma reassured them and promised she would handle it herself.  
Over the next two days, she quietly gathered information on the Lockwood family and Samuel to get a better sense of who he was.  
Once she had a general understanding, she went to the mall and carefully picked out gifts that matched the Lockwood family's preferences.  
After a long day of shopping, she returned home with a car full of presents—only to see Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo waiting at the door.  
They had also brought gifts, nearly filling the entire living room.  
Noticing her confused expression, the three exchanged glances and then began to explain one after another.  
""These were prepared by our families,"" one of them said. ""They wanted us to come and apologize to you in person. You saw what happened that day—Janet was on the brink of death. She got injured again because of you, and we lost control. That's why you got hurt.""  
""Emma, if you're holding any anger, take it out on us. Just don't involve the elders, and don't blame Janet for everything. She was a victim too.""  
Emma could tell immediately that they were only here because their families made them come. Forced to apologize, and forced to speak on Janet's behalf.  
She was not in the mood to argue, so she simply responded with distant politeness.  
""Take your gifts away. This matter isn't worth talking about anymore. I'm tired, so I'd like to rest now.""  
As she spoke, she rubbed her aching eyes and reached into her bag to pull out her phone.  
Without noticing, the box containing the Lockwood family's marriage token slipped out and landed right at Isaac's feet. He bent down to pick it up.  
""What's this?""  
Anthony and Mateo glanced over, and the second they saw the box, their expressions changed.  
""A marriage token?"" Anthony asked, eyes narrowing. ""Emma, you've already chosen who you want to marry? Who is it?""

\# Chapter 5  
Emma looked up when she heard the commotion. The moment she saw they were about to open the box, she quickly snatched it back.  
Her sudden reaction made the three of them freeze, their eyes locked on her.  
""Who did you choose? Anthony, Mateo, or... ""  
Isaac did not finish his sentence, but Emma knew what he meant.  
He was afraid she had picked him.  
She forced a faint smile and met their eyes steadily.  
""So what if I've decided? So what if I haven't? There's no need to be so nervous. Either way, it has nothing to do with you.""  
Anthony suddenly grabbed her wrist, panic in his voice.  
""What do you mean it has nothing to do with us? If there's going to be a marriage arrangement, it can only be between you and one of us! There's no one else in our generation that qualifies!""  
Mateo stepped closer too, his gaze sharp and unwavering.  
""We know you had a hard time choosing before, so we never pushed you. But now that you've decided, just tell us the truth. We're tired of this too.""

My wife fell for Japan after a couple of visits, and is now trying to drag me there, too.

Honestly, I would rather stay home, but well, I feel like it’d cost me less to give in this time.

However, I insisted we would stay away from big cities, and cruise between small towns, preferably, coastal. She said, the planning was all mine, and washed her hands.  
Here is where the problems started.

I chose **Kyushu**, so we will be landing in **Fukuoka**, and in my planning, we’d get 7-day railpasses (10-12 days total trip duration), and go down to **Kagoshima** by bullet train, then switch to local trains slowly going up the Eastern coast, somewhere cutting to **Nagasaki**, then back to **Fukuoka** right before the railpass expires, and stay there for a few more days before flying back.  
We decided to stick to trains because a) we don’t want to refuse wine in the morning, and b) railpasses are dear, so may they be used to their fullest.

We’re both totally **indifferent to religious venues**, so all shrines, pagodas, temple gates, are not for us; we **don’t buy souvenirs** or **clothes**. We want to feel the **charm of rural Japan**. A **village tavern** with a story, a sudden bend of an alley, a special sunset, a **local sake brewery** (yes! yes!! pleeeeease!!!!!), a **local sort of tea** – this kind of things.  
Definitely not what TripAdvisor would suggest in their ""*10 things not to miss in Someplace*"".

OK the first place I am planning to go to is **Makuradzaki** (right off the plane, early afternoon), simply because it is the end of the rail track, and also the end of the island, somehow get to the western coast, and that’d be the first day. Next morning we’d swim some, and get back on the road.

But.  
As I spend hours over google maps’ street view, I just keep seeing the same endless dull streets with \[extremely\] surprisingly few businesses like eateries or coffee places or pubs; those places that are there just don’t look any attractive – I’d rather make myself a sandwich than walk in an establishment looking so lousy. Literally, nothing has so far managed to catch my eye. Endless dull streets, one after another.

Granted, I am spoiled being an expat into my 28^(th) year of living in China… But honestly, honestly I expected more from Japan.

Please tell me that I was doing something wrong!

What charms are **Miyazaki**, **Nobeoka**, **Beppu**, **Mojiko**, **Aso**, other towns along the railway keeping ready to be discovered?

I've never been, she's been once before with family and didn't really like it (more for the fact her family doesn't really share her interests & she had to chaperone the elderly) 

I'm looking for suggestions from locals of must see/visit/eat experiences, noting the fact we're based in ASEAN so the wonder of large hawker-bazaar type markets & temples is less exotic/new to us overall 

Here's a few thoughts I've had so far (no particular order): 

1. Vietnam's Women's Museum and/or Vietnam's museum of ethnology   
\-- Probably going to one of these, she's been involved with work supporting ethnic communities in the past, and also is a strong feminist so these seem in her wheelhouse

2. Old Quarter & Train Street  
\-- Instagram stuff, not really sure what to do here except wander about 

3. Coffee making class/tour   
\-- She's a massive coffeeholic, seen there's a few tours online so interested to hear if anyone has any direct experience/recommendations

4. Dong Xuan and/or Hang Da Markets  
\--- Basic SEA markets for photowalking

5. Water puppet theatre  
\--- Mildly interested, also looks maybe a little boring 

6. Pho  
\---- Heard it's best up north, very curious to see if that's true. Any suggestions welcome!

7. Bun Cha  
\--- Because Obama

8. Giang Cafe  
\--- Heard this was the birthplace of egg coffee? 

9. Any other bars/restaurants/experiences/districts you would recommend??

1m5d8pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m5d8pu/i_am_a_painter_and_im_not_alone_in_this_house/,I am a painter and I’m not alone in this house,"As the title says, I am a Painter. Not the fancy kind like Picasso or Van Gogh, I’m a house painter. It’s a pretty fun job if you like painting walls white all the time but I make it my mission to work on older buildings that actually have unique features and that want special attention.

That gets us to the phone call I had last week, nothing out of the ordinary, just someone calling me to come paint a few rooms in their 18th century home. The man who called spoke quietly and frantically almost like he didn’t want someone else to hear, or maybe they were just in a rush, you’d be surprised at how many people need things painted a day before a big event. I went there one afternoon to have a look at the job, it was a far ways from the city, out in the country, tall gum-trees surround this gigantic mansion which looked straight from a history book. I wanted to stare at it longer but I couldn’t while a strong Oder of death was lingering on my nose “jeez, what’s dead around here, let’s just get this quote over with” I walked up to the door, if you could call it that. This door was made from a beautiful dark red wood that was so large even a castle would be jealous of its size yet even then my eyes were drawn to the knocker. Dark iron with a bulls head and the handle of the knocker going through its nose.. I knocked 3 times.. the sound echoing through my ears like thunder struck right in-front of me.

The man who greeted me at the door answered almost instantly like he was waiting for me. He looked... disheveled, not his clothes, his clothes were clearly old but well kept, almost like he was hoping his green vest and red evening gown would distract me from his knotted grey balding hair or his teeth which are far and few between and what I can only make out to be gold and lead fillings practically replacing each one. He was old, so old that if he wasn’t from the same century as his home he definitely would not be from this one. While staring at me with piercing amber almost yellow eyes he spoke, sporadically but not without thought “Ah... you must be the painter, you said noon and here you are bang on time! My name is John Winslow or At least that’s what it says in my office! AHA HA.. OH The house! You must see what the job is, don’t be alarmed... the whole house isn’t changing... just a few rooms...""

After knocking on the door, I was still a bit on edge and the way he spoke just freaked me out. “That’s all good Mr Winslow, let’s go see those rooms you need painted.” I said, trying to brush the unease off of me. As we stepped inside I was taken back by the architecture of this building. So much old, engraved, red wood through the house. All the floorboards so shiny you could use them as a mirror. This house looks and feels so lively. I had to ask, “What an amazing house. Do you live with anyone else or is it just you?” Silence... He eventually replied uneasily “I’m the only one who walks these halls.” Weird, but okay. 

He showed me 3 rooms, a large dining hall, the kitchen and the basement. The other rooms he wanted me to just freshen up what was already there, but the basement required specific instructions... He told me, “The basement MUST be painted last... I will leave a tin of paint down here for you to use when it’s time. I would appreciate it if you didn’t come down here until you must.” It’s the first time he has spoken to me with such stern words. I replied, “Of course John, I can do that.” Winslow continued, “Good, now there is only one more matter to attend to. I will be away when you come to paint this house and the drive is quite long and out of the way. Please stay here for the few nights you work, so I know my house is safe. It also saves you the drive each day."" 

Although he is an odd man and the house is a bit unsettling, it’s an hour and a half drive without traffic and doing that every day does sound annoying. I quoted this job quite high as I don’t really want to do it, so might as well make it worth the money. Knowing I’ll be getting so much for the job, saving money on fuel at the same time sounds like a good idea. “Thank you so much for the offer John, I’d happily stay here to look after and repaint your house.” I really hoped I would not regret that.

The weekend I would spend painting at the Winslow manor was finally here. As I drove up to the mansion I was still gobsmacked by its sheer size. Why would someone live here by themselves? He had to have cleaners to help or something. As I got out of my car, the smell of death was just as strong as the other week. Maybe a dead bird? But why would no one clean it up? Whatever.

Thunder resounded as I used the door knocker to alert Winslow of my presence. Winslow still answered the door as if he had been waiting for those 3 knocks. “AH James my boy, it’s so excellent to see you, please come in.” He sounded very excited this time which was a good change. “Glad to be here John. Will you be here all of today and head out tomorrow?” I asked. “NO, no not at all. I just needed to tell you some last minute information before I left is all. Your bedroom is just down this hallway, DO NOT go upstairs no matter the reason. And don’t forget you must paint the basement last and not go inside until it’s time. Is that all good!?” 

I was a bit nervous about that but nevertheless agreed. “Sounds good to me John, I’ll get my stuff in and start painting."" As I grabbed my things, I was just beginnig to shake the unease when he spoke. “Well, I’m off! Have an excellent stay, don’t go upstairs. I’m serious. BYE”. The moment that door shut the house became quiet. So quiet it was impossible not to listen. Even in this large house I’m confident I would hear a pin drop from any room. I had to distract myself, so I started painting.

The first day went pretty well. Nothing much to talk about. However, at one point I had to grab something from my car. I walked out of the dining hall, turned right,  walked to the end of the hallway, turn left, entered the main entrance and walked outside. I grabbed my ladder and walked back in. I go to the left of the main entrance, the second door on the right, go down the hallway. On the left is the door to the dining hall, I open it. Wait, I’m positive this is how you get to the dining hall. But I’m standing in the doorway looking into a small white room. This room doesn’t even look like it’s from the 18th century. It’s clearly a modern room, no woodwork, just white with a painting of the manor on the back wall. I retraced my steps back to the entrance and try again. Okay that’s right. I open the door, dining hall. That’s weird, maybe I got lost? I thought I took the same directions. It’s a big house I guess. I tried my best to rationalise it and get back to work. Besides that one moment, the day was fine. I wish I could say the same about that night.

First off, the shower was loud. The moment I turned on the hot water the pipes rattled through the entire house. It was so loud I shut it off and tried to slowly turn it back on. The noise stayed until it was hot. I had no problems in the kitchen making my food, but I had an uncomfortable feeling I was being watched. Nothing was around, this house is so quiet it would be impossible for someone to sneak around, right? Well, that leads me to when I was sleeping. I was impressed at how well I got to sleep that’s for sure, but then I woke up to a thud... a thud from upstairs that was followed by light footsteps. My body froze. Mind racing. What the hell is in this house? The footsteps slowly made their way to the top of the staircase... then they stopped. 

My bedroom is close to the main entrance so I knew that’s where they were. I was told upstairs was off limits. Is someone still living here? Nevertheless, I didn’t want to make a sound. The steps started again, walking away from the stairs and right above where I was sleeping... I knew it, the steps were still light, almost as if they were tip toeing around hoping they could be quiet. But sadly for them this house is so void of sound that their attempt sounded like a march. I shut my eyes, pulled the blanket over my head, and prayed I’d go to sleep soon.

Yesterday started earlier then I would have wanted. After the footsteps I didn’t sleep a wink. I was frozen in bed from midnight till sunrise and didn’t hear a single footstep after it was right above me. I got out of bed, made some noise. Still no movement. Maybe I was going crazy, or maybe an animal got in the house and my scared mind just imagined the human element. I hoped that was it. I started my day by walking down to the bottom of the staircase, slowly peaking up, and just for good measure yelling not so loudly, “He.. hello! Anyone home?” Praying I didn’t hear a reply. Thankfully, silence. At least I think silence is better. Today I’m not going to mess about, I need to finish this job as soon as possible. Time to crank the music and get started! “What the hell.” I muttered as I realised all the walls I painted yesterday were still soaking wet, like I painted them just a moment ago. That’s impossible. It wasn’t cold last night and this place has a terrible draft coming through. So we have temperature and airflow. How in the world is it still wet. The only thing left to do while the walls are wet is paint the basement. But Winslow's warning interrupts that idea...

I made my way to the dining hall, left from the entrance second door to the right, down the hall to the left. Made it. The dining hall is a room with no windows but has a lot of lights hanging from the ceiling, so I turn them on. A lightning bolt of adrenaline ran up my spine as I clearly hear the opposing door in the dining hall shut... I didn’t see anything. It didn’t look like it moved, but I heard it. I’m not crazy. That’s it, I’m going outside far away from that room and calling John. 

I call him and he doesn’t answer. I call him again. On the 4th ring he finally picks up. “Ah, hello my dear boy. Is everything going okay? I can’t wait to see the house with a fresh coat of paint! How was your stay last night?” I ignored his greeting. “Is there anyone else in the house? I heard someone last night and I think I heard something today as well.” He chuckled, “Aha, you have nothing to fear. I mishear things all the time there. Those old floorboards still have plenty of settling to do! Don’t be alarmed if you hear it. That house has plenty of quirks.”
“I see, maybe I miss heard, I’m sorry, such a big house, it’s easy for the mind to wonder. Oh and it might take a bit longer to finish the job, the walls aren’t drying as fast as I thought they would.” I replied. I was hoping that meant John would be back home by the time I finished. Maybe that would make the creepy stuff settle down. Why did he have to say, “Oh well, that’s a coincidence. I'll be away for a few more days. The house will be all yours so take as much time as you need.”
Great, so I guess I’m by myself. The rest of the day went okay, I guess.

The walls dried so I could get stuck into working but I had the feeling I was being watched again. After finishing the dining hall, I went to leave but heard the back door that got closed earlier, open back up... I slowly turned around, horrified of what I’d see. Nothing. 
I ran. Keeping my eyes on the open door, I sprinted away, running into a coffee table that wasn't there a second ago. “Ouch what the hell?” As my attention is brought to the object that just obiterated my shin, I realised I’m suddenly in the modern white room I found yesterday. How was I here? I didn't run very far before colliding with the table. I should've only reached the hallway in that time...

The white room now consists of a painting of the manor and a coffee table. I look behind me, the other door is shut again. Like it never opened. Maybe that means it's safe. I walk out of the white room and back into the dining hall. After turning around I realise the white room is gone, all I see is the hallway. Although I'm petrified, I need to know. I walk to the other side of the dining hall. as I get closer to the door. My head starts pulsing, tunnel vision sets in. My body knows this is a terrible idea, but I push forward. I reach the door, my whole body on edge ready for the door to open on its own once more. I grab the handle and try to slightly wiggle it. 

The handle has no free play, as if someone or something has a firm grasp on the other side... I press the side of my head against the door, my ear perched beside the vanished timber. I know breathing when I hear it... I muster all my strength and courage. I force myself to open that door. I can't see straight, I'm lightheaded, I push forward. As I reinforce my hold of the golden engraved doorknob, I feel my body trying to recoil. as I take a deep breath, I force my hand to open the door. It won't budge, whatever is on the other side is keeping this door shut. to have such a strong grasp that I can't even make the handle rattle. I ran outside shutting every door in between myself and that thing and finally reaching the open air as I shut the giant front door.

As I caught my breath, I made sure to never remove my gaze of that behemoth of a door. But as much as I tried, I got a stark reminded of the first warning this house gave me. The smell of death. That thick smog of Oder grew stronger making my stomach churn and my throat gag. I can't stay here any longer. I hopped in my Ute, turned it over, threw it in gear and went to make some tracks. It's not moving, it feels as if I was trying to tow something too heavy for the car to move. ""God damn it!"" I said as I shake with fear, just wishing I was home, wishing this was all a dream. I get out of the car ""What the hell, what is happening!"". 

The roots of a nearby gum-tree had intertwined with the spokes of my rear wheel. thick roots, for that to happen in reality it would take years, decades even, but here before my eyes, I bear witness to a miracle or in my current situation, a curse. Naturally I tried my phone ""no signal? I had it this morning!' I expelled. I started weighing up my options. I can't drive anywhere, can't get help, I'm at least over a day's walk from any civilization and I didn't see any other cars on this road or any other driveways anywhere near here. I'm screwed.

I hate to admit it but the smell outside was harder to stomach then sitting in the bedroom I currently call home. As much as I don't want to go inside, this stench has made me far more lightheaded than my fear. I went back inside sprinting straight to the bedroom locking myself in. One my door was shut the house was quiet. Then the steps started. Started right above my head, walking right above where ever I moved in my room. I stood still with fear, the foot steps stopped also. I walked over to make sure the door was definitely locked, the footsteps followed. I sat back on my bed, unsure what to do. The footsteps followed. I heard a loud bang, followed by rapid footsteps. It was running, sprinting down the stairs and into the hallway that my room attaches to.

I sit here typing out what has happened in the last week. As a shadow sits on the other side of my door. Thinking about it now, that front door was wide open when I ran back inside..",2,1753085871.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
