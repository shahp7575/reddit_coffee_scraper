I've been having terrible insomnia and getting about 4 hours of sleep at night.  So I took a heavy does of melatonin last night and was still drowsy this morning and stayed in bed too long.

After that, I was shocked to have to scrape the ice off my car in APRIL in the south.  Between these two things, I was late to work.

Then my stomach was upset from the poor sleep plus drinking coffee on an empty stomach to counter the drowsiness.

Then my wife spends an hour the morning texting me upset about something I forgot to do at home that I missed, becauseI was so drowsy.

Then when it is time for me to go to lunch, I realize my wallet is gone.  I spend about 20 minutes panicking and searching the building before I finally find it. My stress is already at a breaking point now.

Now I can finally go the the cafeteria and buy the hamburger I pre-ordered.  I buy the burger and go back to my desk to eat it, only to find that some dumbass in the kitchen put all the contents of the burger in the container with no bun!  I have never had to specify before that I want my burger to actually be a burger.  I took it back to the cafeteria to tell someone, but all the staff there have already left, since it is 12:45.

I decided to just eat it with a fork, and spent the next several minutes trying to one, since the cafeteria didn't have any.  By the time I found a fork, the food was already gross and cold, so I just gave up.

I went back to tbe cafeteria to buy a Dr. Pepper.  I don't normally drink soda, but I just really wanted one after everything.  Of course, they are out of stock, since they seem to only refill  the coolers every other week.

Now it is only 1PM and I have to figure out how to get myself through the rest of this day without jumping off the roof.  And it's only Monday.  I just hope I can sleep well tonight, because I can't take melatonin again.",1,1744049679.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1jts310,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ooziboiii/comments/1jts310/mind_eater_first_contact/,[MIND EATER] [FIRST CONTACT],"The hum of the city, a low thrum that usually soothed Sarah, now grated on her nerves. It vibrated through the floorboards of her apartment, a constant, unsettling percussion to the whispers that had begun to plague her. At first, they were faint, barely perceptible – a rustling in the background of her thoughts, like the faintest brush of a phantom's wing. They were inconsequential murmurs, snippets of conversations she couldn't quite place, words that dissolved into meaninglessness the moment she tried to grasp them. But they were persistent. They insinuated themselves into the spaces between her breaths, into the quiet moments between heartbeats. 

The whispers started subtly. A misplaced object. A flickering light. The feeling of being watched, even when she knew she was alone. The apartment, once her sanctuary, now felt alien, charged with an unseen energy. The familiar scent of old books and brewing coffee was overlaid with a metallic tang, a faint coppery taste lingering on the back of her tongue, a taste she couldn't explain. She’d chalked it up to stress, to the relentless pressure of her job, the mounting loneliness of city life. But the stress, she realized with a growing unease, wasn’t easing. It was intensifying, twisting into something darker, something more sinister. 

One evening, nestled amongst the soft glow of her reading lamp, surrounded by the comforting weight of her books, the whispers intensified. They were no longer just background noise; they were a chorus, a cacophony of voices weaving themselves into the fabric of her reality. They spoke in a language she didn't understand, yet somehow, viscerally, she comprehended their chilling intent. It was a language of dread, of impending doom, woven from the threads of her deepest anxieties and darkest fears. The words, sharp and jagged, sliced through the quiet of her apartment, leaving trails of icy fear in their wake. 

Her sleep became a torment. The whispers followed her into her dreams, transforming the familiar comfort of her bed into a suffocating prison. Her dreams were no longer gentle escapes into fantasy but nightmarish tapestries woven from fragmented memories and surreal landscapes. She found herself in places she'd never been, living lives she'd never lived, experiencing emotions she'd never felt. One recurring dream, particularly vivid and disturbing, saw her standing before a vast, obsidian mirror, her reflection twisting and contorting, morphing into something grotesque and alien. The face staring back was not hers, but a distorted parody, a grotesque mockery of humanity. 

The whispers began to affect her waking hours, subtly altering her surroundings. The layout of her apartment seemed to shift, familiar pathways becoming labyrinths, rooms appearing and disappearing as if guided by an unseen hand. Her memories, too, began to fracture. Childhood events, once clear and vibrant, now dissolved into hazy sketches, their edges blurred, details melting like ice cream on a hot summer day. She found herself remembering moments that couldn't have happened, memories that were clearly not her own. Faces flickered in her mind’s eye, fleeting images of people she couldn't identify, places she’d never visited, experiences that felt both utterly foreign and profoundly familiar. 

The sensation of being watched intensified. She felt eyes upon her, unseen, yet undeniably present. It was a feeling that seeped into her bones, chilling her to the marrow. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end, even in the summer heat. She’d jump at the slightest noise, her heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird. The shadows in her apartment seemed to writhe and shift, taking on malevolent forms, distorting themselves in the periphery of her vision. Simple everyday tasks—making coffee, brushing her teeth, checking her emails—became exercises in terror, each action fueled by a growing sense of impending doom. 

One morning, she woke to find her reflection in the bathroom mirror completely different. Her eyes were a shade darker, more intense, the pupils dilated, almost black. Her skin felt cold to the touch, strangely pale, and her pulse beat with an unnatural rhythm, a rapid, erratic thumping that echoed the whispers. A thin, almost invisible scar had appeared on her left wrist, a jagged line that pulsed faintly with a light that seemed to come from within her flesh. Panic seized her, a cold, clammy fear that wrapped around her like a shroud. She was changing. 

The whispers evolved. They were no longer just fragments of sound but fully formed sentences, pronouncements, commands whispered just beyond the threshold of her conscious mind. They spoke of vast, unimaginable spaces, of a reality beyond human comprehension. They spoke of a power that dwarfed everything she'd ever known, a power that was slowly, insidiously, taking hold of her. The words weren't spoken in any known language; they were feelings, raw and visceral, transmitted directly to her soul. Fear, dread, and an insidious sense of inevitability. 

The apartment became a prison, yet escape felt impossible. The city, once a symbol of freedom and opportunity, now felt like a vast, inescapable cage. Each passing day brought new horrors, new transformations. The physical changes were subtle at first, but they accelerated. Her movements became more jerky, her coordination less certain. Her body felt alien, as if it no longer belonged to her. The whispers, once a mere annoyance, became a constant, tormenting presence, shaping her thoughts, her actions, her very being. They were chipping away at her sanity, dismantling her sense of self, one subtle whisper at a time. 

One night, amidst the swirling chaos of hallucinations and fragmented memories, a voice, clearer than any of the others, spoke directly to her. ""You are a story,"" it hissed, the words like shards of ice against her skin. ""And I am your author."" Then, a terrifying realization dawned on her – she was not only being consumed by this entity, but she was also being watched by someone else, someone outside of this horrific experience. The fourth wall shattered. She was aware, in a bone-chilling way, that she was a character in a narrative, her very existence controlled by forces beyond her comprehension. This horrifying revelation was a terrifying metamorphosis, the beginning of her descent into something truly horrifying and unprecedented. The unseen narrator, aware of her situation, began to directly address her, and then, through her, the reader. The true terror was only beginning",1,1744049607.0,u_ooziboiii,0,1.0,False

1jts2rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jts2rc/crazy_ex_like_crazy/,"CRAZY EX, LIKE.... CRAZY","For some context, I'm in college and I've always questioned my sexuality and I've always been very indecisive, so it's safe to say that I'm bisexual but I hate going by labels so I suppose I'm just up for whatever, I've had my share of experiences in the past with the same gender but at the time of our relationship, that was all deep in the past and I wanted to forget it all. however, me and my ex broke up in February and I think it's safe to say everything that's going on, is faaaaar from finished. But here's my story so far

I got with this girl in April of 2024 and before and during the first few months of our relationship, everything was great, we loved each other and would always laugh when we were around one another. But later on, I began to question whether what Id gotten into was a friendship which was just under the wrong title. This is for a few reasons. The first reason was that she was VERY committed and seemed to want plan our entire lives ahead of the game, including weddings, houses, children etc. All of these kinds of conversations would kinda make me look into my future and feel almost trapped, like I'd signed a waiver telling me I MUST live this exact life and there is no way out. I don't know why I felt like this over someone I loved but it just seemed like a lot of pressure for someone of my age (17 at the time). 

Another issue was that I have had a girl best friend who moved away, the full way across the country to manchester due to deep family issues, and me and her had been best friends for years before I even knew my ex, and in our relationship, she would never ever let it go. She would always ask old friends of mine about this girl and try to pry info out of them, almost as if she WANTED to find something to argue about, because that was her mentality. I do understand the suspicion behind me being best friends with another girl but she hardly ever said it to my face and would always try to bring our friends (Originally my friends from high school) into our drama. 

Around two or three times in our year long relationship, I would travel across the country to meet this long term best friend of mine and stay at her house for a few days, for clarification, I would tell my gf every time I went up and we would sit down and talk about the situation, she would rightfully be anxious that I'm going to another girls house for the weekend but I'd always assure her that we were only friends (common sense should say that if me and my best friend were gonna date, we would have started dating YEARS before this). So I would always tell her that nothing would happen between me and her and we would reach a conclusion every time, both in agreement. 

Every single time I'd be in Manchester, my girlfriend would always send me a LONG ass message, telling me how worried she is about if I'm doing stuff with my best friend and it would 99% of the time lead to a huge argument and we would be at a stalemate until I got back home, to which we would see each other in person again and joke around and everything would be fine. 

If I was ever up in Manchester my best friend would always tell me that she sees something bad in my girlfriend, and that she's not healthy for me Becuase she starts all of these arguments, which is my next point.

Over almost ANY of my personal opinions that I'd share, she would cause a huge argument over it. I remember being in class and my table had a conversation that ""if you had to kiss a celebrity of the same gender, who would it be"" so I (pretty fairly) said 'kit Harrington' and she went off on a huge rant, asking me if I was still gay or if I still have feelings for guys etc, and this argument never really went away.

Introducing some more people, I was in a group with one other guy and 2 girls, the guy and one of the girls were dating and the other girl never felt anything towards men, let's call this group the silly sausages. So I would hang out with the silly sausages once or twice on a pretty even 2 week basis, we would hang at one of our friend's houses and always watch a horror film or two. And quite deep into our relationship me and the silly sausages decided to invite my girlfriend to hang out with us one time. The day went good but over the following days these friends would each tell me 'i see something strange in her', especially the girls since 'girls know girls'.

Anytime somebody said they saw something strange in my gf I wouldn't think anything of it since I loved her and 'I don't care what anyone else thinks'.

Time came around when concerts started going on sale and me and my gf went to 2 of them, both in October of 2024, 2 days apart. For one I had lent her a shirt with the band name on it Becuase she didn't have any merch so I gave it to her just for that one show. Besides that, earlier in the year I booked tickets to Billie Eilish and id asked my gf if she wanted to go with me and she said she couldnt and gave me the excuse of 'i haven't got enough money atm' which is valid, so rightfully so, I invited my best mate (the girl in Manchester). I thought that since my gf and by best mate have a big deal with each other, I'll tell my gf that I'm going with my cousin (of the same name as my best mate, by coincidence), just to save us from another argument. I thought it was a good idea so when comic con came around I asked my gf and she gave me the same excuse why she couldn't go, so invited the girl from 'the silly sausages' who isn't into guys cuz we both liked films etc. I used the same excuse in that I was going with my cousin yet again simply to avoid the arguments (which in the relationship, were genuinely CONSTANT) 

A bit further near the end of the relationship me, the silly sausages, my gf and a few other close friends were sitting in a coffee shop (bear in mind I never gave my gf any details on my past relationships with other men Becuase it wouldn't be necessary) I go to the toilet with my guy friend cuz we both needed to go, and my gf and one of the girls from the group stand outside and one of the girls mentions one of my past experiences with a guy (Becuase at the time I was open with it and I foolishly told a lot of people a lot of the details etc). This, being new news to my gf, caused a very deep and embarrassing conversation and I had to explain who he was, what happened and everything in between, my legs were shaking the whole time And I hated every second of it. But we came to the conclusion that it was in the past and that I've changed. (She held onto the story and uses it against me later on Becuase that's just what she does and I knew she would do it) 

Many many arguments and make ups, and trips back and forth from Manchester later, I was sat with 2 of my college friends, alone. My girlfriend wasn't around at the time And she'd booked us tickets to see Lana del Rey in 2025 whilst I was on holiday a month or two prior. And I spoke my mind to these friends and just said ""guys... I feel like the only reason I'm still with *her* is Becuase she has the tickets to see Lana del rey, otherwise I'm fed up with the arguing Becuase it's making me miserable and putting too much stress on me"". They both agreed and told me she wasn't good for me so when my gf walked into the class, she kept asking me what was wrong and we went outside to chat.

I told her that the commitment to our relationship was extremely heavy and it was putting way too much pressure on me and that I can't chain myself down to such a fixed path in life Becuase she'd plan our entire life all the time. To cut to the chase, I broke up with her that day and we went our seperate ways home and left on (what I thought) good terms, I was still gonna see Lana del Rey and we were gonna be friends.

Sidenote - So she had a tendency to make up stories in her head and believe them which caused her to overthink every situation, so during the breakup, i told her not to make up stories or reasons I ended the relationship and that I'd told her everything she needed to know, however she did not listen at all and would constantly be asking everyone questions about my past life, who my closest friends were, who my past relationships were etc.

One night which I will never forget, me and the silly sausages went to an escape room, then to a KFC (bear in mind my ex used to work at this KFC, but she quit months before this) then, one of the girls in the group said ""how crazy would it be if *my ex* showed up cuz she used to work here"" then she actually did walk through the doors and told the other guy in the group that she came in to get her sister a wrap (remember this info). Then me and the 2 other girls sat at a table quite far away and my mate (the male one) stayed behind and spoke to my ex.

My mate then came back to the table and my ex left, no wrap in hand, not even a bag. She never ordered anything. And my mate sat down with his food after half an hour of talking and told us everything she said, he has invited her to sit with us but she said ""no I hate them, urm sorry, I hate HIM"". This really annoyed the two other girls Becuase they had done nothing but help my ex when she was upset in the past and she's just gone and said she hates them, I don't think she meant 'just me' I reckon she MEANT 'i hate them' and realized who she was talking to so quickly switched up her words

Another thing that happened was that she was asking this friend all about whether I was gay, if I was trying to get with *Manchester best friend* or if I was trying to get with one of the girls of this group and she would not leave him alone that whole time. 

We all came the the conclusion that she stalked the one of the friend's or my Snapchat locations Becuase a couple of days later she had a go at me for doing an escape room with the silly sausages when I said me and her were gonna plan one (during the relationship, which by this point, was over), I never told her we did an escape room, nobody did, and yet she knew?? Then she shows up at the same KFC as us? Then she leaves without buying the wrap for her sister like she said?? And once we all left the KFC, we looked at the car far behind and on the right of us in the car park which had 3 people in it, 2 in the front, one in the back. And we all said ""that person in the back looks like *my ex*"" so we stayed in the car park, acting like we were eating, I called *Manchester friend* Becuase she loved drama so the 4 of us plus *Manchester friend on the phone* are in the car and we come up with the idea that if the 2 girls go to put rubbish in the bin, they can get a better look at who is in the car. So when they leave to go to the bin, the girl in the back suspiciously ducks down so we can't see her.

The male friend in the silly sausages then snaps *my ex*, to try and find out where she is, and she sends a snap back saying she's at home in her room, however id been to her house many many times and the light fixture that was on the ceiling in the snap, was not the one in her room, so we all reckon she had fake snaps and she sent one to this friend as almost a decoy.

After we wait in the carpark for about 45 minutes we decided to leave and as we turn the first corner me and my friend both see the car leave and head the right direction as if u were going to my ex's house.

 a week or two after, me and my college best mate (the only other guy from the Silly Sausages friend group) were in a lesson and I was talking about how much freeer I felt (my ex wasn't in the room at the time). My friend was talking all about how he's glad she's out of our lives Becuase he couldnt stand her attitude and hated the way she treated me so my friend did not like her at all. Then all of a sudden she walks in and sits down. She's quiet for a little bit and then turns to my friend and just says ""so why do you hate me then"". She basically sent the whole class into silence and my friend just mumbled something like 'i don't know I just don't like you' and she then turned to me and repeated herself saying 'what so you hate me too?? Is this how it is? Is this how you really feel about me?"" Then she started fully shouting at us telling us how heartbroken she felt, with the entire class and the teacher listening in, then she stormed out.

This annoyed my friend so much since he'd just been  ridiculed in front of everyone and that's when we both just thought ""we need her fully out of our lives Becuase she isn't gonna give up on this breakup""

After that things died down but also got kinda worse. She blocked anybody who had anything to do with me on Snapchat and Instagram and whatever else she could, but she never blocked me on Pinterest, which I found odd Becuase she would always question me on my Pinterest Becuase I'm an artist so there's a lot of nude drawing of men and women on there Becuase I was doing drawings about the human body at the time, so there was a lot of naked drawings on there etc, so shed always act off about that. So I found that interesting. Anyways, I had a tattoo inspo board on Pinterest and one of the tattoos was on the 'little finger's side of the hand, right on the edge, and it was just words, and I wanted my favorite Lana del rey album tattooed there. A few days later she comes into college late and rumors go around saying she has a tattoo, I ask a close friend of hers what the tattoo is of and she said "" it says honeymoon, it's on the side of her hand and she says it's her favorite Lana del Rey album"". That really got to me, Becuase during our relationship, Honeymoon was 'our' album becuase id had a birthday party themed around it so it was quite significant to us both, so why she would steal one of my designs and get that specific album tattooed is absolutely mental to me.

One final thing she did , which was literally the other day, was (remember I lent her that band T-shirt for that concert?) well, j never got it back after the breakup and she wore it into college the other day and I'm looking at demanding to have that shirt back Becuase I never told her she could keep it and it would be common courtesy to give it back.

That's pretty much the whole story though so Thanks for reading it, I'll update this if anything else happens.",1,1744049588.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1jts1r2,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1jts1r2/time_looped_chapter_87/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 87,"“An alliance…” Will repeated.

That explained why no one had interfered during his hunt of the goblin. Even so, he would have preferred if the biker had made the proposal to him, rather than Helen.

“I don’t think it’s just the numbers,” the girl said, sipping a new variant of tea that she had ordered. It tasted a bit too bitter for her taste, but was definitely different. “I’d say there’s a class requirement of some sort. They insisted on us two. Alex and Jace were an afterthought.”

Will could see that. At the same time, he’d be lying if he said that he didn’t find the thought of taking down the archer appealing. So far, the entity remained a nearly supernatural figure capable of killing off anyone of his group, even Danny back when he had been alive. It wasn’t in the least surprising that he managed to rank in the top tier during the contest phase.

“And Danny never said anything about that?” Will asked, even if he knew he was on thin ice.

“Apparently, he kept it to himself. All part of eternity, I guess.”

“What is?”

“The secrets.”

Will felt as if a knife had been stuck in his gut and twisted several times. He, too, was keeping way more secrets than he would have liked. Looking back, it had always started small. A skill here, an agreement with Danny there. Before he knew it, he had set loose Danny’s reflection into the world, obtained several unique skills, and whatnot. It would take him an hour to go through all the secrets he’d kept from Helen, and that was if she didn’t kill him before he was done.

“Everyone has secrets,” he said in a somber tone.

“That’s part of eternity. Secrets bring individual strength and group weakness.”

Will wasn’t certain whether that was deep or not, but nodded all the same. The more he sat there, the more he wanted to tell her all about Danny, but at the same time, the more he was afraid of how she’d react.

“So, what do you think?” She looked at him. “Do we tell the guys?”

“Yes,” Will said after a while. “The more we are, the better. Plus, we’ll have a few more on our side for when the alliance breaks down.”

“I thought as much. I’ll tell them next loop.”

“Next? Why not this one?”

“What’s the point? They’re already doing their solo challenges. What good will there be worrying about other stuff?”

That was true. Maybe Will would tell her about Danny after Helen had finished her solo challenge.

“Did the acrobat say anything more? About the challenges, I mean?”

“She wasn’t very chatty. There was one more thing, though. She said we should save ourt coins. Seems the merchants in the next phase are a lot better. We can buy skills from there.”

“That’s good to know. I bet we’ll probably get something nice for killing the archer. Each boss dropped some useful skills, possibly a weapon, too.”

There was no chance that they’d get the weapon. From the few similar fights they’d had so far, the weapon was only one, and likely the other members of the alliance would claim it.

“We’ll see.” Helen finished her tea. “I’ll get going. I want to finish my challenge fast, so I focus on mirror hunting.”

Hidden mirrors didn’t drop anything exceptional, but it was better than doing nothing. Besides, they could always be sold for coins at the crow’s nest merchant.

“Sure. I’ll take care of the bill.”

“Just like a date.” Helen smiled, then left the coffee shop.

The comment would have been appreciated a lot more if Will didn’t have so many other things on his mind. The information the girl had just provided had changed everything. Up to a moment ago, his main goal was to become strong enough to take on the other looped. But above all, to face Danny. The sudden alliance had marked a new target, putting Will’s personal gripes on the back burner.

“Hey, don’t worry about it,” the barista said all of a sudden.

“Huh?” Will stared at him.

“It’s always confusing the first few times. I’ve seen it more times than I can remember. You have no idea how often couples come here to break up or make up. The main thing is to keep things calm and in perspective. Never be lacking, but don’t go too fast, either.”

“Err, sure…”

Pleased with his advice of the day, the barista returned with the bill and a very small box of chocolates for Will to buy. With money being a temporary issue, Will bought it, then tucked it away in his backpack and left the coffee shop.

As he walked to his challenge mirror, the boy tried to clear his mind of any needless thoughts. Sadly, that wasn’t as easy as it seemed. By the time he had arrived at the small grocery shop, his stress levels had increased to the point that had completely forgotten that the store owner didn’t remember him.

“Looking for anything?” The man asked, eyeing Will with suspicion.

“Err, a fresh,” the boy said out of habit.

“Are you sure? That’s pretty expensive.”

“Yeah.” Will took out his card. “I know.”

The moment of confidence proved enough to sway the store owner, who gave him one more look, then went to the juice squeezer.

“What fresh do you want?” he asked.

“The classic,” Will replied.

The option was accepted, and the man stretched to get a few oranges from the nearby pile. Soon enough, the sound of a small mechanical motor began, as the juice was being squeezed out of the fruits.

“Are you from the area?” the shopkeeper asked.

“No, but I study nearby.” Will ventured closer to the mirror. It was huge, as always, with multiple postcards on it.

“Ah. Probably tired of all the artificial things they sell there. Am I right?”

Instead of an answer, Will reached out and tapped the reflective surface. The shop, and everything in it, vanished. All of a sudden, Will found himself floating in the middle of an endlessness of twisted reflections, as if he had been transported into a giant fractal. He tried to look into the distance, but felt as if something was trying to claw his eyes out. A single square mirror floated before him, providing a bastion of sanity.

 

**ROGUE CHALLENGE**

 

**Which side of the mirror do you wish to emerge from?**

**INNER / OUTER**

 

This was the first time the goblin skill had kicked in, transforming the start of the challenge into a miniature riddle.

Some explanations would have been nice, but eternity was stingy with its hints. The only way to obtain them was to find and tap the mirrors that provided them, and even then, there were no assurances there wouldn’t be further prerequisites present.

“Inner,” the boy said.

Both messages vanished, and he was transported into some sort of small hall. The walls, floor, and ceiling were made of white stone, like in a medieval castle.

Mirrors were placed on the walls—ten feet from each other—providing the only source of light. Further ahead, a double door was visible, indicating the way to the challenge. Knowing better, Will went to the nearest mirror and tapped it.

 

**HINT 1**

**You can only rest or leave after completing a floor.**

 

That partially resembled the wolf challenge. Of course, back then there had been only waves without any actual structures. 

Eager to get a clear picture, Will went past the remaining two mirrors on that same side of the room, tapping each in turn.

 

**HINT 2**

**Rewards obtained in the course of a floor can be given away to increase the significance of the final floor reward.**

 

**HINT 3**

**Upon restarting the challenge, you can continue from the floor you reached or restart from the beginning.**

 

Seeing that nothing in the hints stood out, Will went to the other side of the room and tapped the remaining three mirrors. As expected, those turned out to be the actual rules of the challenge.

 

**ROGUE CHALLENGE (1/3)**

**Complete all nine levels of the rogue tower, completing one floor at a time.**

 

**ROGUE CHALLENGE (2/3)**

**A floor is considered complete once all enemies on it are defeated. Upon completing the floor, a reward will be granted based on the candidate’s performance.**

 

**ROGUE CHALLENGE (3/3)**

**You are only allowed to use rogue skills.** 

 

That last bit was a bit of an issue. Will’s copycat skill was going to be a hindrance. The principle of the entire thing was clear: the goal of the challenge was simultaneously to teach a person how to play a class, as well as limit the use of overpowered combinations. Suspiciously, there was no explicit mention of enemy types, suggesting there might be more than one.

With all the messages revealed, Will pressed his mirror fragment against them, collecting the hints as he did. It was a shame that he couldn’t smash them, but the mirror copy skill wouldn’t bring him anything in this challenge. Maybe he’d save that for the thief one. 

“Here I come.” The boy grabbed the right handle of the double door, then pulled it open.

His action was followed by a leap to the right, and just in time to escape the series of darts that flew through the opening. 

*I knew it!* Will thought, drawing his own throwing knives.

In a rogue tower, the most likely enemies he’d face would be other rogues. Why did it have to be a tower, though?

Will dashed across the open door. He expected to see a single humanoid enemy across the threshold. Instead, he saw about a dozen. To make it stranger, they weren’t neither human nor goblin, but living mannequins dressed up in rogue outfits. The complete lack of facial features was most disturbing, though it didn’t prevent Will from sinking two knives in the nearest rogue’s head.

The blades struck their target with a wooden sound, causing it to collapse to the floor with a thud.

*Doesn’t take much to kill them, at least*, Will thought as he dashed back across the opening, knife in hand.

This time, none of the mannequins were visible, all of them lying in wait. Clearly, in order to win, he’d have to take the initiative.

Without a moment’s hesitation, Will took his backpack off and tossed it through the door. 

Knives centered on it from all directions, quickly transforming it into pincushion.

Not thinking of the consequences, the boy charged in immediately after. Knives flew at knives, missing each other, but striking the knives’ owners. In Will’s case, his evasion skill kicked in, saving him from a quick failure, if only just.

Two more marionettes fell to the floor, reducing the total number to eight.

Gritting his teeth, Will performed a series of side leaps, then charged at the nearest enemy. 

That almost proved to be a costly mistake. The way the rogues fought was consistently from a distance. None had attempted to approach Will, and in the instance he had, the rogue had immediately leaped back, continuing with ranged attacks. In a bizarre way, it almost felt as if Will was facing a much less skilled archer.

*Evade, leap, attack. Evade, leap, attack.* Will kept repeating to himself.

It was a terrible way to fight, only further proving how woefully unprepared he was. The marionettes used the simplest of actions. Their speed was considerably slower than Will’s, and their evasion skills were close to nonexistent. And even then, as a whole, they were doing a lot better than the boy. With the amount of effort he put in, he was supposed to have dealt with them in less than a minute. In practice, he wasn’t sure he’d manage to do so in an hour.

“You pieces of shit!” Will shouted to let off some steam. Of the ten knives he had thrown, three managed to hit the torso of his opponent, rendering him motionless.

*One more!* Will told himself. That was the only way he’d beat them. As long as he remained alive and focused on a single enemy, there was no way he’d lose.

I’m a service manager at a mechanic shop. I’m in my early 20s and work with other men in their 50’s and 60s. Or a few teenage kids in high school. So already I feel alienated. 

My co worker [early 60s M] who I’ll call “Tim” in this story is a mechanic originally born in chile. He had an accident and died for minutes and then found the lord after years of drinking. Being an asshole. Doing drugs. 

I’ve worked here for 3 years now and I’ve watched him slowly get sucked into a religious cult. We live outside of nyc and his “church” is there. I think it’s a charismatic or evangelical type. But nothing I’ve seen or heard before. 

Not only do his “pastors” call him up and beg for Zelle payments, but he tells us all about his church and what kind of things they do. People in the church aren’t allowed to talk to the different sex alone. 

Tim is a severe diabetic and also is a far right conspiracy theorist anti medicine type of dude too. His diet is absolutely strange. 

He will say he fasts for a week at a time. He drinks a pint of heavy cream a day with multiple cups of coffee. He will drink pine needles tea. Other things he thinks will regulate his diabetes. 

I saw a video from his church YouTube where they encouraged a woman with schizophrenia to throw her meds in the “witchcraft pile” and chant while she shakes the evil sprits out of herself. 

 He tries to regulate his blood sugar on his own. He doesn’t trust doctors. He a pompous arrogant man to begin with. But the church has made him believe that his diabetic hallucinations are visions from Christ. He’s told me he would stay up until 3am to pray. 

He talks about witchcraft all the time. How his church fights it. He won’t eat chicken because they’re used for witchcraft. How he can see these spirits and demons in people. 

He believes demons come in the form of animals. Gorillas, apes, bugs, and will see peoples face morph into them. He’s accused his daughter of using witchcraft because she’s apparently “woke” he said god gave him a dream of wasps and read about it in the Bible. Then when he saw his daughter he said he saw her face morph and grow swollen like she was stung by a million bees. 

This dude is everything people stereotype about conservatives. But it’s with religion. He will take off of work for “deliverances” across the country. He came back saying that he had 4 demons in him. 

The other week, he ditched work to drive down south to save a church friends daughter from “being kidnapped” which come to find out, was in a “spiritual sense” 

He calls women jezebells. Claims that dozens of women (some even as young as 20) in his church throw themselves at him. Which I highly doubt. Every week another woman in his church are having issues and beef with him. ",2,1744049512.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

I've never really been in a proper relationship as I didn't really seek it up until recently, but dating is just gruesome and I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  
I've been out on 12 first dates these past few months, mostly from bumble, and it doesn't really get any better.  
With this last girl I've made it to a 6th date and we labeled ourselves as being bf and gf and then few days after that she writes me that she isn't feeling 'it' and while she enjoys spending time with me and appreciates the effort I've put in, she doesn't think we're right for each other..  
A little bit about me, I'm 5 11, I gym 4 to 7 times a week, try to eat right, earn well, bought my own 3 bedroom apartment, my car, no debt what so ever, and I have two degrees. The dates always seem to go well, we talk for hours, I make her laugh, even with the shy types I do well as I manage to make them comfortable and make them laugh.  
But somehow I am still single, what do I really do wrong?  
The only thing I can think of is that I am too nice of a person and maybe I'm not direct enough when it comes to physical contact. I mean very rarely I tried to go in for a kiss after a 1st date, but I always got denied when I did. At most I'll grab her hand at the table and we'll hold hands. Should I really be pushing for more physical contact on the first date already?  
Also, the conversations aren't one-sided either, and I try to keep it polarizing enough, maintaining my own opinions and not just agreeing with everything she says. I do however act like a gentleman, I hold the door for her, always arrive before her and wait for her outside the restaurant/pub/coffee shop, I try to dress nice and have a clean look, I'll help her with her coat.. and for these things I've gotten positive feedback.  
Feedback I've gotten from women who rejected me was along the lines of ""no physical chemistry, I prefer the bulkier type, you give off a friend vibe, I feel like something is missing, I didn't feel a spark"". Other feedback, which I viewed as positive, was ""You made me feel safe, you are well mannered, a gentleman, I felt protected"".  
Should I legit just act like an asshole or dissociate myself from these dates? Or what the hell am I doing wrong really? I have an easy time getting dates from bumble, I always get more than enough matches and do really well during the chatting phase, but somehow after a date, or two or three, it's over.

TL:DR: I have no idea what I'm doing wrong in the dating game",1,1744049491.0,relationships,2,1.0,False
1jts19w,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jts19w/crazy_crazy_ex/,Crazy CRAZY Ex,"For some context, I'm in college and I've always questioned my sexuality and I've always been very indecisive, so it's safe to say that I'm bisexual but I hate going by labels so I suppose I'm just up for whatever, I've had my share of experiences in the past with the same gender but at the time of our relationship, that was all deep in the past and I wanted to forget it all. however, me and my ex broke up in February and I think it's safe to say everything that's going on, is faaaaar from finished. But here's my story so far

I got with this girl in April of 2024 and before and during the first few months of our relationship, everything was great, we loved each other and would always laugh when we were around one another. But later on, I began to question whether what Id gotten into was a friendship which was just under the wrong title. This is for a few reasons. The first reason was that she was VERY committed and seemed to want plan our entire lives ahead of the game, including weddings, houses, children etc. All of these kinds of conversations would kinda make me look into my future and feel almost trapped, like I'd signed a waiver telling me I MUST live this exact life and there is no way out. I don't know why I felt like this over someone I loved but it just seemed like a lot of pressure for someone of my age (17 at the time). 

Another issue was that I have had a girl best friend who moved away, the full way across the country to manchester due to deep family issues, and me and her had been best friends for years before I even knew my ex, and in our relationship, she would never ever let it go. She would always ask old friends of mine about this girl and try to pry info out of them, almost as if she WANTED to find something to argue about, because that was her mentality. I do understand the suspicion behind me being best friends with another girl but she hardly ever said it to my face and would always try to bring our friends (Originally my friends from high school) into our drama. 

Around two or three times in our year long relationship, I would travel across the country to meet this long term best friend of mine and stay at her house for a few days, for clarification, I would tell my gf every time I went up and we would sit down and talk about the situation, she would rightfully be anxious that I'm going to another girls house for the weekend but I'd always assure her that we were only friends (common sense should say that if me and my best friend were gonna date, we would have started dating YEARS before this). So I would always tell her that nothing would happen between me and her and we would reach a conclusion every time, both in agreement. 

Every single time I'd be in Manchester, my girlfriend would always send me a LONG ass message, telling me how worried she is about if I'm doing stuff with my best friend and it would 99% of the time lead to a huge argument and we would be at a stalemate until I got back home, to which we would see each other in person again and joke around and everything would be fine. 

If I was ever up in Manchester my best friend would always tell me that she sees something bad in my girlfriend, and that she's not healthy for me Becuase she starts all of these arguments, which is my next point.

Over almost ANY of my personal opinions that I'd share, she would cause a huge argument over it. I remember being in class and my table had a conversation that ""if you had to kiss a celebrity of the same gender, who would it be"" so I (pretty fairly) said 'kit Harrington' and she went off on a huge rant, asking me if I was still gay or if I still have feelings for guys etc, and this argument never really went away.

Introducing some more people, I was in a group with one other guy and 2 girls, the guy and one of the girls were dating and the other girl never felt anything towards men, let's call this group the silly sausages. So I would hang out with the silly sausages once or twice on a pretty even 2 week basis, we would hang at one of our friend's houses and always watch a horror film or two. And quite deep into our relationship me and the silly sausages decided to invite my girlfriend to hang out with us one time. The day went good but over the following days these friends would each tell me 'i see something strange in her', especially the girls since 'girls know girls'.

Anytime somebody said they saw something strange in my gf I wouldn't think anything of it since I loved her and 'I don't care what anyone else thinks'.

Time came around when concerts started going on sale and me and my gf went to 2 of them, both in October of 2024, 2 days apart. For one I had lent her a shirt with the band name on it Becuase she didn't have any merch so I gave it to her just for that one show. Besides that, earlier in the year I booked tickets to Billie Eilish and id asked my gf if she wanted to go with me and she said she couldnt and gave me the excuse of 'i haven't got enough money atm' which is valid, so rightfully so, I invited my best mate (the girl in Manchester). I thought that since my gf and by best mate have a big deal with each other, I'll tell my gf that I'm going with my cousin (of the same name as my best mate, by coincidence), just to save us from another argument. I thought it was a good idea so when comic con came around I asked my gf and she gave me the same excuse why she couldn't go, so invited the girl from 'the silly sausages' who isn't into guys cuz we both liked films etc. I used the same excuse in that I was going with my cousin yet again simply to avoid the arguments (which in the relationship, were genuinely CONSTANT) 

A bit further near the end of the relationship me, the silly sausages, my gf and a few other close friends were sitting in a coffee shop (bear in mind I never gave my gf any details on my past relationships with other men Becuase it wouldn't be necessary) I go to the toilet with my guy friend cuz we both needed to go, and my gf and one of the girls from the group stand outside and one of the girls mentions one of my past experiences with a guy (Becuase at the time I was open with it and I foolishly told a lot of people a lot of the details etc). This, being new news to my gf, caused a very deep and embarrassing conversation and I had to explain who he was, what happened and everything in between, my legs were shaking the whole time And I hated every second of it. But we came to the conclusion that it was in the past and that I've changed. (She held onto the story and uses it against me later on Becuase that's just what she does and I knew she would do it) 

Many many arguments and make ups, and trips back and forth from Manchester later, I was sat with 2 of my college friends, alone. My girlfriend wasn't around at the time And she'd booked us tickets to see Lana del Rey in 2025 whilst I was on holiday a month or two prior. And I spoke my mind to these friends and just said ""guys... I feel like the only reason I'm still with *her* is Becuase she has the tickets to see Lana del rey, otherwise I'm fed up with the arguing Becuase it's making me miserable and putting too much stress on me"". They both agreed and told me she wasn't good for me so when my gf walked into the class, she kept asking me what was wrong and we went outside to chat.

I told her that the commitment to our relationship was extremely heavy and it was putting way too much pressure on me and that I can't chain myself down to such a fixed path in life Becuase she'd plan our entire life all the time. To cut to the chase, I broke up with her that day and we went our seperate ways home and left on (what I thought) good terms, I was still gonna see Lana del Rey and we were gonna be friends.

Sidenote - So she had a tendency to make up stories in her head and believe them which caused her to overthink every situation, so during the breakup, i told her not to make up stories or reasons I ended the relationship and that I'd told her everything she needed to know, however she did not listen at all and would constantly be asking everyone questions about my past life, who my closest friends were, who my past relationships were etc.

One night which I will never forget, me and the silly sausages went to an escape room, then to a KFC (bear in mind my ex used to work at this KFC, but she quit months before this) then, one of the girls in the group said ""how crazy would it be if *my ex* showed up cuz she used to work here"" then she actually did walk through the doors and told the other guy in the group that she came in to get her sister a wrap (remember this info). Then me and the 2 other girls sat at a table quite far away and my mate (the male one) stayed behind and spoke to my ex.

My mate then came back to the table and my ex left, no wrap in hand, not even a bag. She never ordered anything. And my mate sat down with his food after half an hour of talking and told us everything she said, he has invited her to sit with us but she said ""no I hate them, urm sorry, I hate HIM"". This really annoyed the two other girls Becuase they had done nothing but help my ex when she was upset in the past and she's just gone and said she hates them, I don't think she meant 'just me' I reckon she MEANT 'i hate them' and realized who she was talking to so quickly switched up her words

Another thing that happened was that she was asking this friend all about whether I was gay, if I was trying to get with *Manchester best friend* or if I was trying to get with one of the girls of this group and she would not leave him alone that whole time. 

We all came the the conclusion that she stalked the one of the friend's or my Snapchat locations Becuase a couple of days later she had a go at me for doing an escape room with the silly sausages when I said me and her were gonna plan one (during the relationship, which by this point, was over), I never told her we did an escape room, nobody did, and yet she knew?? Then she shows up at the same KFC as us? Then she leaves without buying the wrap for her sister like she said?? And once we all left the KFC, we looked at the car far behind and on the right of us in the car park which had 3 people in it, 2 in the front, one in the back. And we all said ""that person in the back looks like *my ex*"" so we stayed in the car park, acting like we were eating, I called *Manchester friend* Becuase she loved drama so the 4 of us plus *Manchester friend on the phone* are in the car and we come up with the idea that if the 2 girls go to put rubbish in the bin, they can get a better look at who is in the car. So when they leave to go to the bin, the girl in the back suspiciously ducks down so we can't see her.

The male friend in the silly sausages then snaps *my ex*, to try and find out where she is, and she sends a snap back saying she's at home in her room, however id been to her house many many times and the light fixture that was on the ceiling in the snap, was not the one in her room, so we all reckon she had fake snaps and she sent one to this friend as almost a decoy.

After we wait in the carpark for about 45 minutes we decided to leave and as we turn the first corner me and my friend both see the car leave and head the right direction as if u were going to my ex's house.

 a week or two after, me and my college best mate (the only other guy from the Silly Sausages friend group) were in a lesson and I was talking about how much freeer I felt (my ex wasn't in the room at the time). My friend was talking all about how he's glad she's out of our lives Becuase he couldnt stand her attitude and hated the way she treated me so my friend did not like her at all. Then all of a sudden she walks in and sits down. She's quiet for a little bit and then turns to my friend and just says ""so why do you hate me then"". She basically sent the whole class into silence and my friend just mumbled something like 'i don't know I just don't like you' and she then turned to me and repeated herself saying 'what so you hate me too?? Is this how it is? Is this how you really feel about me?"" Then she started fully shouting at us telling us how heartbroken she felt, with the entire class and the teacher listening in, then she stormed out.

This annoyed my friend so much since he'd just been  ridiculed in front of everyone and that's when we both just thought ""we need her fully out of our lives Becuase she isn't gonna give up on this breakup""

After that things died down but also got kinda worse. She blocked anybody who had anything to do with me on Snapchat and Instagram and whatever else she could, but she never blocked me on Pinterest, which I found odd Becuase she would always question me on my Pinterest Becuase I'm an artist so there's a lot of nude drawing of men and women on there Becuase I was doing drawings about the human body at the time, so there was a lot of naked drawings on there etc, so shed always act off about that. So I found that interesting. Anyways, I had a tattoo inspo board on Pinterest and one of the tattoos was on the 'little finger's side of the hand, right on the edge, and it was just words, and I wanted my favorite Lana del rey album tattooed there. A few days later she comes into college late and rumors go around saying she has a tattoo, I ask a close friend of hers what the tattoo is of and she said "" it says honeymoon, it's on the side of her hand and she says it's her favorite Lana del Rey album"". That really got to me, Becuase during our relationship, Honeymoon was 'our' album becuase id had a birthday party themed around it so it was quite significant to us both, so why she would steal one of my designs and get that specific album tattooed is absolutely mental to me.

One final thing she did , which was literally the other day, was (remember I lent her that band T-shirt for that concert?) well, j never got it back after the breakup and she wore it into college the other day and I'm looking at demanding to have that shirt back Becuase I never told her she could keep it and it would be common courtesy to give it back.

    Melanie's Erotic Reawakening
    
    Chapter 1: A Mixtape Rediscovered
    
    Melanie wiped a thin layer of dust off the shelf, her fingers skimming over the spines of countless CDs she hadn't listened to in years. She paused at a small cassette tape, a relic from a bygone era. Turning it over, she read the faded label: ""John - Our Songs.""
    
    Her heart skipped a beat. John. Her high school sweetheart. The boy who had written her love notes between classes and surprised her with homemade mixtapes. The boy whose touch had ignited a firestorm of passion within her—the intensity of which she'd never experienced again in the years since.
    
    She pressed the cassette into an ancient Walkman, the buttons stiff from disuse. As the first strains of music filled the room, memories came flooding back.
    
    ""You okay?"" Karen's voice broke through the haze of nostalgia. She stood in the doorway, arms crossed and eyebrows raised.
    
    ""Yeah,"" Melanie said softly, still lost in thought. ""Just... remembering.""
    
    Karen wandered into the room, peering curiously at the cassette. ""That John?"" she asked knowingly.
    
    Melanie nodded, a faint blush coloring her cheeks. ""I—I don't know why I'm doing this. It's silly, right? He's ancient history.""
    
    Karen smirked knowingly. ""Maybe. But you're still thinking about him."" She leaned against the wall, eyeing Melanie shrewdly. ""That crush never really went away, did it?""
    
    Melanie sighed, setting the Walkman down gently. ""No, not really. But what does it matter now? It's been... God, almost twenty years.""
    
    As the music swelled, Melanie's mind drifted back to their first real date—a stolen moment in the school's music room, where the piano had felt warm beneath her fingers.
    
    ""I think you should find him,"" Karen said suddenly, breaking the silence. ""What do you have to lose?""
    
    Melanie blinked, startled by the suggestion. ""Find him? I—""
    
    ""Why not?"" Karen pushed off the wall, moving toward the door. ""Go on, girl. Take a chance.""
    
    Melanie stared at the cassette, her thumb brushing over the label. 'John - Our Songs.' Her pulse quickened.
    
    The next morning, Melanie woke with a start, her chest tight with anxiety. She pulled out her phone, fingers hovering over the keyboard.
    
    ""Come on,"" she muttered. ""Just do it.""
    
    She typed in ""John Thompson,"" hitting search with a barely audible click. Dozens of profiles flickered across the screen, each attached to a face that wasn't her John. She scrolled downward, growing more frustrated by the second.
    
    And then—there he was. A larger man now, hair slightly grayer, but unmistakably the same bright eyes and crooked smile she remembered.
    
    Her finger hovered over the message button, trembling slightly.
    
    Hi John, she typed, pausing after each word. It's Melanie. From high school. Remember me?
    
    She stared at the screen for a long moment, then hit send before she could change her mind.
    
    The ding that echoed through her apartment nearly an hour later made her jump. With shaking hands, she opened the message.
    
    Melanie! Wow, I... yeah, I remember. Been a long time. What's up?
    
    A wave of relief washed over her. He remembered. He'd written back.
    
    I was just listening to one of the mixtapes you gave me, she typed back carefully. They're still my favorite songs. I thought... maybe we could catch up?
    
    Another anxious hour passed before her phone buzzed again.
    
    I'd like that. There's a coffee shop near my apartment—The Daily Grind. Want to meet tomorrow afternoon?
    
    Melanie's heart raced. ""Yes,"" she whispered to the empty room.
    
    Perfect. See you then, she messaged back, a soft smile playing on her lips.
    
    The next afternoon found Melanie pacing outside The Daily Grind, tugging nervously at the lower part of her shirt. Her reflection in the window showed a woman a little older than the girl she remembered, but still beautiful in a soft, understated way.
    
    The bell above the door chimed, and she turned—her breath catching in her throat.
    
    John stood before her, taller than she remembered, his presence filling the entryway. His eyes, the same striking blue, swept over her appreciatively.
    
    ""Melanie,"" he breathed, stepping forward. His arms came around her, solid and warm.
    
    She melted into the embrace, burying her face against his shoulder. His scent enveloped her—the same spicy cologne he'd worn all those years ago.
    
    ""Hi,"" she murmured, pulling back slightly to look up at him. Her cheeks flushed pink, and her lashes fluttered shyly.
    
    ""I can't believe it's really you,"" John said, his voice low, intense. ""You're even more beautiful than I remembered.""
    
    Emotions swirled in Melanie's chest—nerves, longing, exhilaration. She swallowed hard, searching his gaze. There it was—lingering beneath the surface—the same magnetic pull she'd felt so strongly back in high school.
    
    ""Can we sit down?"" she asked softly.
    
    He nodded, leading her to a quiet corner booth. As they slid in opposite each other, Melanie's heart pounded wildly against her ribs.
    
    ""So,"" John began, leaning forward with a gentle smile. ""Tell me what you've been up to all these years.""
    
    Melanie met his gaze, the warmth of anticipation washing over her. She opened her mouth to speak—but all she could think about was how badly she wanted to touch him again.
    
    
    Chapter 2: Reconnecting Passion
    
    Melanie bit her lip as John poured them each a cup of coffee, her fingers curling around the ceramic mug. The steam curled lazily upward, mingling with the scent of freshly ground beans.
    
    ""I've been... well, I guess you could say I've been living,"" she managed, forcing a lightness into her tone that didn't quite match the pounding of her heart. ""Work, bills, the usual stuff. But—""
    
    Her words trailed off as she took a sip, her eyes flitting briefly to the window. Outside, a pair of young lovers strolled hand-in-hand, the easy familiarity between them both envious and nostalgic.
    
    John cleared his throat, drawing her attention back to him. ""That's good. You—you seemed happy.""
    
    His gaze lingered on her, a warmth in his eyes that made her want to squirm. Instead, Melanie straightened in her seat, clasping the mug tighter as though it were a lifeline.
    
    ""Yeah, well—I've had my moments,"" she admitted, giving him a crooked smile. ""But hey, let's not dwell on the past, right? Tell me about you. What have you been up to all these years?""
    
    John shifted slightly in his chair, his broad shoulders filling the too-small space. ""Oh, you know... college, career, the usual. Got married for a bit—didn't work out. But I've been lucky. Gotten to travel a bit, you know?""
    
    Melanie nodded, sipping her coffee to hide the sudden pang of curiosity. Had he ever married someone he truly loved? Someone who made him forget, even for a moment, the wild-eyed girl who used to slip notes into his locker?
    
    ""And what about you?"" John asked, leaning forward, his arm brushing against hers. ""Any adventurous stories there?""
    
    Melanie inhaled sharply at the contact, the fabric of John's sleeve rough against her skin. She shook her head. ""Nothing too exciting. Moved to the city after graduation, started working at a nonprofit.""
    
    ""Sounds fulfilling,"" John mused, his eyes fixed on her with an intensity that made her squirm in her seat.
    
    ""It has its ups and downs,"" she hedged, shifting uncomfortably. ""But listen to us, trading boring life facts over stale coffee.""
    
    A small laugh escaped her, light and airy. John's answering smile widened, crinkling the corners of his eyes.
    
    ""Guess we're both a little out of practice with this whole... reconnecting thing, huh?""
    
    Melanie nodded, taking another sip of her drink. The liquid had grown lukewarm, but she barely noticed. Her senses were alive with John's presence, the faint spice of his cologne tickling her nose, the rich timber of his voice resonating deep in her chest.
    
    Without meaning to, her gaze flicked downward—to the strong line of his jaw, to the fullness of his lips. Suddenly, the memory of their first kiss came rushing back, vivid and overwhelming.
    
    ""That mixtape,"" she blurted, desperate to cling to something, anything, besides the building heat inside her chest. ""I—I still listen to it sometimes.""
    
    John's eyes softened, a trace of vulnerability showing through. ""Really? I mean, wow—""
    
    He trailed off, seeming uncertain. Melanie leaned forward unconsciously, her fingers brushing across the table to land atop his.
    
    ""Hey,"" she said softly, meeting his gaze. ""Want to get out of here?""
    
    There was a question in her eyes, loaded with implications.
    
    John swallowed, his Adam's apple bobbing. ""Yeah,"" he breathed, standing abruptly. ""Yeah, let's go.""
    
    John's apartment loomed ahead, shadowed by the bare streetlights. Melanie's stomach twisted with nerves as she climbed the worn stone steps behind him. She paused in the doorway, adjusting her grip on the strap of her purse.
    
    John turned, catching her hesitation. ""Melanie,"" he murmured, reaching out to brush a lock of hair behind her ear. His fingertips grazed her cheekbone lightly.
    
    She shivered at the touch, her lashes fluttering downward as she glanced up at him through elongated lashes.
    
    Without a word, John drew her inside, the door clicking shut behind them. Melanie stood in the entryway, swallowing hard as her eyes adjusted to the dim lighting.
    
    Then John was beside her, close enough that she could feel the heat radiating from his body. He tilted her chin upward with a careful finger.
    
    ""You've grown up beautifully,"" he whispered, his voice husky.
    
    Before she could respond, his lips captured hers in a fierce, hungry kiss. Melanie gasped softly, her hands flying up to grip the front of his shirt.
    
    John groaned into the kiss, his tongue delving past her parted lips to stroke against hers. The taste of him flooded her senses—coffee, spice, and something uniquely him.
    
    He backed her slowly into the apartment, hands roaming her curves. Melanie arched into his touch, craving more. When they reached the couch, John lifted her effortlessly, setting her down on the plush cushions.
    
    He lowered himself beside her, pressing hot, open-mouthed kisses along her jawline. Melanie tilted her head instinctively, baring more of her neck.
    
    His teeth grazed her pulse point before his lips settled over hers once more. Hands slipped beneath her sweater, palming the soft swell of her breasts.
    
    Melanie moaned, arching into his touch. Then—oh God—his fingers were hooking into the waistband of her jeans, tugging insistently.
    
    She sat up enough to shimmy out of her pants, kicking them aside. His hands smoothed over newly exposed skin, stroking reverently.
    
    Soon, she was left in just a lacy bra and panties. John's eyes devoured her as they raked over the curves of her body.
    
    ""God, Melanie,"" he breathed. ""You're even more perfect than I remembered.""
    
    Heat bloomed in her core at his words. She hooked a leg around his hip, drawing him closer. His arousal pressed firmly against her thigh.
    
    John growled low in his throat, his hands cupping her bottom to hike her up higher on the couch. He rolled, positioning himself between her spread legs.
    
    Their gazes locked, dark and molten with want. Melanie's fingers tangled in his hair, tugging him closer until their noses brushed.
    
    ""Kiss me,"" she breathed.
    
    He complied, sealing his lips over hers in a searing embrace. His tongue delved deep, stroking against hers in a filthy promise of things to come.
    
    
    Chapter 3: Rekindled Love
    
    The next morning, Melanie awoke slowly, her body still flushed and tender from the night before. Beside her, John lay sprawled out on the bed, his chest rising and falling evenly with each breath.
    
    She smiled softly, reaching out to brush a stray lock of hair from his forehead. Even asleep, he looked at peace—content.
    
    Memories of their lovemaking came rushing back, each touch, each caress, each breathless moan. It had been so effortless—so right—with John. Like coming home to something she'd been missing her entire life.
    
    ""Mmm..."" John stirred, blinking open his eyes. They landed on Melanie's smiling face and crinkled at the corners.
    
    ""Morning,"" she murmured, leaning in to press a feather-light kiss to his lips.
    
    ""Morning,"" he echoed, stretching languidly. His hand skimmed over her hip, fingertips digging in possessively. ""Last night was—wow.""
    
    Melanie laughed softly, nuzzling into his neck. ""Definitely wow-worthy.""
    
    John's arms tightened around her, holding her close. ""I've been thinking... maybe we could try something. Together, I mean.""
    
    Melanie blinked up at him, heart skipping a beat. ""Like what?""
    
    He shrugged, a sheepish grin tugging at his lips. ""Well, I've always loved that cabin my parents rent out. Peaceful... private. Could be nice if we spent a weekend there... catching up properly, you know?""
    
    Excitement tingled down Melanie's spine. A whole weekend with John, surrounded by nature's seclusion? The possibilities sent heat spiraling through her core.
    
    ""That sounds perfect,"" she breathed, rolling onto her side to face him fully. ""When can we go?""
    
    John's answering smile widened. ""How about Friday? It's supposed to be clear all weekend. We could drive up after work.""
    
    Melanie's heart soared. ""I'll pack tonight then. Oh, John—I can't wait.""
    
    Friday arrived far sooner than either of them anticipated. Before they knew it, they were pulling up to the cozy cabin nestled among towering pines. Steam curled invitingly from the stone fireplace visible through the window.
    
    ""This is lovely,"" Melanie murmured, stepping out of John's car. The fresh, crisp air filled her lungs, invigorating her senses.
    
    John joined her, looping an arm casually around her waist as they approached the front porch. ""It's my favorite getaway. Glad you could come.""
    
    ""Of course,"" she said softly, leaning into his side. ""I wouldn't miss this for anything.""
    
    Once inside, they shed their jackets haphazardly, too eager to explore the cozy interior. Sunlight filtered through the large bay windows, casting dappled shadows across the plush carpet.
    
    ""We can light a fire if you want,"" John offered, shrugging out of his shirt as he moved towards the stone fireplace. ""Or—""
    
    His words cut off with a gasp as Melanie pressed herself against his back, her arms twining around his torso. John's muscles flexed beneath her palms, firm and warm.
    
    ""Or we could just... stay here,"" she purred, nuzzling into his neck. Her lips grazed his pulse point as she spoke. ""You feel so strong... so dependable.""
    
    John's breath hitched, his head tilting to give her better access. ""Melanie...""
    
    She tugged his body closer, reveling in the way his hardness lined up perfectly with her softer curves. Her thighs parted instinctively as arousal bloomed between them.
    
    ""What were you thinking earlier?"" she whispered, her lips ghosting over his shoulder. ""About last night... and this morning...""
    
    John groaned low in his throat, his hands coming up to cover hers where they rested on his chest. ""I was thinking about how perfect it feels with you... how right.""
    
    Melanie shivered at his words, desire licking up her spine. ""Again,"" she breathed. ""I want you again. Please.""
    
    Without another word, John spun in her arms, capturing her lips in a bruising kiss. His hands slid down to grip her bottom, kneading the pliant flesh roughly.
    
    Melanie moaned into his mouth, pressing closer until she could feel the hard evidence of his arousal grinding against her belly.
    
    ""Bedroom,"" John gritted out, nipping at her bottom lip. ""Now.""
    
    Hand in hand, they stumbled toward the master suite, clothes shed haphazardly along the way. By the time they reached the queen-sized bed, they were a tangle of limbs, mouths exploring skin starved of touch.
    
    John fell onto the mattress, pulling Melanie atop him. She straddled his hips, bracing her hands on his chest. His eyes, dark with lust, roamed openly over the curve of her breasts, the dip of her waist, the slick joining of her thighs.
    
    ""You're exquisite,"" he rasped, his fingers skimming up her sides to cup the weight of her breasts.
    
    Melanie arched into his touch, biting her lip as she ground slowly against the rigid length trapped beneath her.
    
    John hissed through his teeth, his hips bucking instinctively. ""Fuck, baby... you feel incredible.""
    
    She leaned down, brushing her lips just beneath his ear. ""I need you,"" she whispered, her voice wrecked. ""Please, John... make love to me.""
    
    His answering groan vibrated against her skin. With a flex of powerful muscle, he rolled them, pinning her beneath his bulk.
    
    Melanie cried out as he entered her in one swift stroke, her back bowing off the sheets. ""Oh god... yes!""
    
    ""Fuck,"" John cursed, his head falling forward as he fought for purchase on the slippery slope of her hip. ""So fucking tight...""
    
    He withdrew, only to slam back inside, setting a relentless pace. The slap of skin on skin filled the room, punctuated by their ragged breaths and desperate moans.
    
    ""Yes!"" Melanie keened, her nails scoring livid red lines down his back. ""Harder, John... please!""
    
    He complied, pistoning into her harder than she knew was possible. The wet squelch of her arousal filled the air with each sharp thrust.
    
    Melanie's vision whited out as pleasure crashed over her in waves. ""I'm close!"" she sobbed, her inner walls fluttering wildly around his thickness.
    
    John angled his hips, driving deeper, hitting that perfect spot inside her that made stars explode behind her eyelids. ""Come for me,"" he commanded, his voice rough with need. ""I've got you, baby... let go.""
    
    Her peak crested swiftly, her body convulsing as ecstasy tore through her. ""John! Oh god—yes!""
    
    John followed swiftly behind, burying his face in the crook of her neck as he spilled himself deep inside her trembling sheath.
    
    They lay tangled together long after, limbs entwined and sweat-slicked skin cooling in the crisp mountain air. Melanie clung to John's broad shoulders, her heart still racing.
    
    ""That was..."" she trailed off, struggling for words.
    
    ""Incredible?"" John supplied softly, pressing a kiss to her damp temple. ""Life-changing?""
    
    Melanie laughed weakly, her fingers tracing idle patterns over his back. ""You're exactly right.""
    
    John shifted, rolling onto his side to face her fully. His hand came up to cradle her cheek, his thumb brushing tenderly over the arch of her cheekbone.
    
    ""I've missed this,"" he murmured, his gaze intense. ""Missing you... it's like I forgot what it felt like to be whole.""
    
    Melanie's breath hitched at the raw emotion in his voice. Slowly, she brought her hand up to cover his, turning her face into his palm.
    
    ""I feel it too,"" she confessed, her voice wavering slightly. ""John... I—""
    
    He silenced her with a gentle finger pressed to her lips. ""Don't,"" he whispered, his eyes shining with unshed tears. ""Not yet. Just... let's live this moment. Right here. Right now.""
    
    Melanie nodded, blinking rapidly to hold back her own surge of emotion. She leaned up on quivering arms, bringing her lips to his in a kiss that was tender, promising, and achingly sweet.
    
    Yes. This was only the beginning.

Chapter 7 : Ranger 

I laid like Carrie sprawled on the floor, eyes wide open, mouth open, vomit slowly dripping from my mouth. I couldn’t close my mouth. I didn’t want to taste it. Taste her. 

I just stared at cricket while she hummed away. 

Soft. Fragile. The kind of song meant to soothe babies and dying things.

Cricket sat in the corner, knees pulled up, arms wrapped tight around her belly. Her cracked lips moved with each word, though I couldn’t place the tune. Something old. Something sad.

I stayed still, afraid to disturb her.

The floor was sticky beneath me. My stomach still churned from the stew, from what she’d said.

She tastes different than the others.

I pressed my forehead to the concrete, willing the memory to leave. It didn’t.

Cricket’s humming stopped.

“You shouldn’t cry so much,” she said. Her voice was light, almost musical. “It’s not good for the baby.”

I turned my head slowly. Her wide eyes were on me, but her hands were still moving—stroking the curve of her belly, back and forth like she was polishing glass.

“You’re not really pregnant. Right ?,” I croaked.

She giggled. “Yes I am.” She looked down lovingly. “He’s shy. But he kicks sometimes when you’re talking.”

My mouth went dry. There was no smile in her eyes. Just something distant and cold—like she was watching a movie that only existed inside her head.

“You don’t feel that?” she asked. “Here, give me your hand.”

She scooted closer before I could stop her, grabbing my wrist with surprising strength. Her skin was burning with fever. She pressed my hand to the slight swell beneath her ribs, her fingers trembling with excitement.

“Right there,” she whispered. “See? Alive.”

I didn’t feel anything. Just the jut of bone, the sharpness of hunger and frostbite under her skin.

But I didn’t say that.

I nodded instead. Slowly.

Her whole body relaxed. “He likes you,” she said. “That’s good. It means you’ll be around when he gets here.”

The words settled on my chest like dirt in a grave.

Around.

Like I was staying. Like I had to.

Cricket started humming again, swaying like a cradle.

And I realized the lullaby wasn’t for the baby.

It was for me.

The days began to bleed together.

No sunlight. No clocks. Just cold and hunger and the slow drip of water from the ceiling, marking time like a broken metronome.

Cricket talked more now. To me. To the baby. To the hook.

She’d started calling it “Carrie’s swing.”

“I used to have one too,” she told me one day, rubbing her belly. “Before he moved me down here. I was special back then. He used to say I was his favorite.” Her eyes grew glossy. “Until Carrie came.”

I didn’t respond. I had learned not to.

Sometimes silence was safer than the truth.

Sometimes silence kept you alive.

But silence couldn’t drown out everything.

Late one night, I heard footsteps. Not Sam’s. Lighter. Quieter. Like someone trying not to be heard.

I shot up, heart hammering. Cricket didn’t move—just stared at the ceiling like she was counting stars that weren’t there.

A shadow passed the window. Just a flicker. A shift in the wind. But I saw it.

“Did you see that?” I whispered.

Cricket didn’t blink. “It’s probably the fox.”

“What fox?”

“The one with the broken leg,” she said dreamily. “She lives out there somewhere. I hear her crying sometimes. Poor thing.”

My pulse thudded against my throat. I crawled closer to the barred window, ignoring the pain in my leg. I didn’t see anything.

But I heard something.

A voice.

Distant. Male.

“…hello?”

I froze.

It was faint. So faint I thought I imagined it.

But then I heard it again.

“Is someone down there?”

My body launched toward the window before I could stop it. I screamed. I screamed until my throat tore.

“Help! Please! Down here!”

The voice grew clearer. Closer.

“I hear you! Hold on—”

Footsteps again. Running this time. Then silence.

Cricket stood up behind me.

“Someone found us,” she whispered. “He’s not going to like this.”

I turned to her, confused.

I backed away from the window, breath hitching in my chest. “Someone heard me,” I whispered. “Someone’s coming.”

Cricket just stared at the door, arms wrapped protectively around her belly. “Not someone,” she murmured. “Him.”

“No. It’s someone else. I heard them—”

The door slammed open upstairs.

Heavy boots on the floorboards.

A pause.

The sound of doors flinging open.

Then the slow, deliberate creak of the basement door.

Cricket sank back into the shadows like a child hiding from thunder. “Told you,” she whispered.

I scrambled toward the wall, heart exploding in my chest.

He came down slowly. One step at a time. A flashlight in one hand, the beam cutting through the dark like a blade.

But it wasn’t Sam. I was right. 

It was a man in a ranger uniform. Hat missing. Beard soaked from snow. Breath fogging in front of his mouth.

“I heard someone screaming,” he said, his voice low, cautious. “Jesus Christ… what is this place?”

I couldn’t speak. I just stared at him, trying to decide if he was real.

He moved closer, shining the light around. It landed on the meat hook. The bloodstains. Cricket.

“What the hell—”

Then his eyes met mine.

“You’re hurt,” he said. “We need to get you out of here. Now.”

He pulled a walkie-talkie from his belt. Pressed the button. Static.

“Of course,” he muttered. “Storm must’ve knocked the signal out. We’re completely cut off.”

I reached for him like I might vanish if I didn’t hold on. “Please. Please don’t leave me.”

He looked at the chain around my ankle. “We’ll figure it out. I live close. Let’s get you warm and safe. Then we’ll call for help.”

He turned to Cricket. “And you?”

She just smiled.

“I like it here.”

He stared at her for a beat, then looked back to me. “We don’t have time. I’ll come back for her.”

He helped me stand. My legs were shaking. The chain rattled.

He knelt, inspecting the lock. “It’s old. Rusted. I might be able to break it.”

But I wasn’t listening.

I was watching Cricket.

And she was watching him.

Her smile never moved.

The ranger knelt by the lock, trying to jimmy it open, when I heard it.

Crunch.

Crunch.

Crunch.

Someone was walking just outside the window. 

Slow. Deliberate. Heavy.

He froze. I did too.

Cricket didn’t.

She lifted her chin toward the ceiling.

“You should go now,” she said.

He blinked. “What?”

She looked at him, her face too calm. “You should go. Now.”

I turned on her, something inside me snapping. “What the fuck is wrong with you?! This is our chance! Why would you say that?!”

She didn’t even flinch. Just rocked slightly, rubbing slow circles over her stomach. “Shhh. You’ll scare the baby.”

More crunching.

The ranger straightened. His eyes darted to the stairs. 

“If he’s just outside, it’s not smart to fight him down here. Not with you two stuck in the middle. I know him. I’ll go upstairs and grab a cup of coffee. Tell him I just stopped by to check on him after that storm. Noticed he wasn’t here and helped myself while waiting for him.”

I felt like the air had been sucked out of my lungs. “So that’s it? You’re just gonna leave us?”

“I’m going to get help,” he said. “My post isn’t far down the mountain. Once I’m back in range, I’ll call for backup and come straight back. I promise.”

Cricket started humming under her breath. That same sick, sweet tune she’d been rocking to for days.

I stared at him. At the stairs. At the fucking ceiling.

“Don’t,” I whispered. “Please don’t leave us.”

He looked back at me—like he meant it. Like he really believed he’d come back.

“I’ll be back.” he said. “Just hang on.”

Then he turned and ran up the stairs.

The door slammed.

And for a second, there was nothing but the wind.

Until—

Click.

The lock turned again and we heard him close all the doors back, make coffee, and say hello to Sam when he walked in the front door. 

I clenched my fists, nails biting into my skin, as the distant sounds upstairs slowly faded into the oppressive quiet of the basement. The fragile hope that had flickered in me was now tangled with despair—and I wondered if, in this labyrinth of frozen time, rescue was nothing more than another cruel trick of fate.

I strained to catch fragments of conversation through the door. A muffled laugh. The clatter of a mug hitting a counter. A brief pause, then the sound of a chair scraping on the floor. I closed my eyes for a moment, letting the darkness take me, wishing I could slip away with it.


I heard the ranger’s footsteps fade away, the sound of his retreat echoing down the hall. Then, through the frosted window, I saw him crouch at the basement’s edge, placing a package of food on a ledge and saying, “I’ll be back—don’t do anything to agitate him.” The promise was brief, and in moments, he was gone.

Before I could catch my breath, heavy, deliberate steps echoed from above. The door creaked as Sam descended the stairs, his gaze fixed on Cricket. My blood turned to ice as I scrambled backward, screaming, “Don’t you dare touch her!”

Without a word, Sam reached out and unlocked the chains binding Cricket. To my shock, she didn’t flinch or cower. Instead, she leaped into his waiting arms, a manic grin spreading across her face. “I’m the new Carrie, don’t worry!” she chirped, her excitement twisted and unsettling.

I froze, my scream dying on my lips as the surreal horror unfolded before me. The sound of my pounding heart drowned out everything as I watched them—a macabre, unholy duo—share a moment that confirmed my worst nightmares.

I was now truly alone.

I laid like Carrie sprawled on the floor, eyes wide open, mouth open, vomit slowly dripping from my mouth. I couldn’t close my mouth. I didn’t want to taste it. Taste her. 

I just stared at cricket while she hummed away. 

Soft. Fragile. The kind of song meant to soothe babies and dying things.

Cricket sat in the corner, knees pulled up, arms wrapped tight around her belly. Her cracked lips moved with each word, though I couldn’t place the tune. Something old. Something sad.

I stayed still, afraid to disturb her.

The floor was sticky beneath me. My stomach still churned from the stew, from what she’d said.

She tastes different than the others.

I pressed my forehead to the concrete, willing the memory to leave. It didn’t.

Cricket’s humming stopped.

“You shouldn’t cry so much,” she said. Her voice was light, almost musical. “It’s not good for the baby.”

I turned my head slowly. Her wide eyes were on me, but her hands were still moving—stroking the curve of her belly, back and forth like she was polishing glass.

“You’re not really pregnant. Right ?,” I croaked.

She giggled. “Yes I am.” She looked down lovingly. “He’s shy. But he kicks sometimes when you’re talking.”

My mouth went dry. There was no smile in her eyes. Just something distant and cold—like she was watching a movie that only existed inside her head.

“You don’t feel that?” she asked. “Here, give me your hand.”

She scooted closer before I could stop her, grabbing my wrist with surprising strength. Her skin was burning with fever. She pressed my hand to the slight swell beneath her ribs, her fingers trembling with excitement.

“Right there,” she whispered. “See? Alive.”

I didn’t feel anything. Just the jut of bone, the sharpness of hunger and frostbite under her skin.

But I didn’t say that.

I nodded instead. Slowly.

Her whole body relaxed. “He likes you,” she said. “That’s good. It means you’ll be around when he gets here.”

The words settled on my chest like dirt in a grave.

Around.

Like I was staying. Like I had to.

Cricket started humming again, swaying like a cradle.

And I realized the lullaby wasn’t for the baby.

It was for me.

The days began to bleed together.

No sunlight. No clocks. Just cold and hunger and the slow drip of water from the ceiling, marking time like a broken metronome.

Cricket talked more now. To me. To the baby. To the hook.

She’d started calling it “Carrie’s swing.”

“I used to have one too,” she told me one day, rubbing her belly. “Before he moved me down here. I was special back then. He used to say I was his favorite.” Her eyes grew glossy. “Until Carrie came.”

I didn’t respond. I had learned not to.

Sometimes silence was safer than the truth.

Sometimes silence kept you alive.

But silence couldn’t drown out everything.

Late one night, I heard footsteps. Not Sam’s. Lighter. Quieter. Like someone trying not to be heard.

I shot up, heart hammering. Cricket didn’t move—just stared at the ceiling like she was counting stars that weren’t there.

Seated beneath an autumn-kissed oak tree.

I feigned my focus and paid attention to anything but her,

The gall of a nearby gull and the whisper of a nearby fir.

But she saw me and saw little beauty,

Instead just a boy not fit for love’s duty.

&nbsp;

On a Sunday kind of day with a Monday's rain,

The world's quiet protest fell and its warmth was slain.

But it coated the windows with a fine mist

And covered me in a winter's bliss.

Cosy and cold, this was the day I was sold

To that coffee girl with mocha eyes,

She captured me with a look that would make any heart capsize.

&nbsp;

And on a Sunday kind of a day she came to me,

I was wrong before, there was more she could see.

With a spring breeze, the cloudless skies shined,

She offered a smile and I accepted in kind.

A blush of bloom in her hair and something in the air.

We talked and we laughed until the day ran out,

My life forever changed, I had no doubt. 

&nbsp;

A Sunday kind of day engulfed with golden sun,

Grainy and full, the world's pain undone.

Amongst the daisies and clovers, she joined me in summer’s haze, 

Winning me again and again with that same coffee shop gaze. 

We walked through our memories, old and new,

Our journey of the seasons, both shared and true.

&nbsp;

And often we’d revisit that distant oak tree,

From long before I had won her and she had won me.

We’d recall those dog days and skies turned grey,

With their gentle breeze and browning leaves.

&nbsp;

The seasons of us, with words too often lost along the way-

But now it’s her who makes each moment feel a Sunday kind of day.

This world is moving fast, and what’s driving the global economy right now isn’t just degrees—it’s skills.

Please guys, take this seriously. Learn something. Anything. Here's a quick list to get your mind rolling:

Graphic & UI/UX Design

Fashion Design

Social Media Marketing

Video Editing & Content Creation

Photography

Animation & Motion Graphics

Programming (Web, App, AI)

Copywriting & SEO

Digital Illustration

Dropshipping & E-commerce

Virtual Assistance

Event Planning

Interior Design

Online Tutoring

Forex/Crypto Trading

Branding & PR

Podcasting

Nail Tech & Makeup Artistry


Some of these are self-taught. I have a friend who taught himself graphic design—bro is minting cash. If you have a friend with a skill, buy them coffee and ask them to teach you.

Fashion design? You can start a brand, hire talent, and boom—you’re a boss. Social media marketing? Build a personal brand or a mini-agency. Create an app that helps link brands with influencers and boom, you’ve got income.

Go on YouTube, TikTok, Coursera, Skillshare, or Google Digital Garage. It’s all there. Free content. People are going live on TikTok selling products, doing GRWM, vlogging daily routines—and making bank.

You’ve got a smartphone? Monetize that thing. Show your skill. Market your business. Record your hustle. Enter the creator economy.

Because let’s be honest, most people with papers are just sitting with them. Not because they’re useless—but without a bribe or a godfather, it’s hard to get in. The world is hiring what you can offer, not what you studied.

Look at people like Khaby Lame, IShowSpeed, and the local hustlers on TikTok—you think they waited for a “job”?

This is the sign. Wake up. Build your skill. Chase that bag.
Let’s create a new Kenya that thrives on skills, not connections.

1jtrhna,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/1jtrhna/i_just_want_to_share_some_coping_skills_that/,I just want to share some coping skills that sometimes help (not always),"This is going to be long. Maybe none of it applies to you, maybe one thing is a new technique. This isn't perfect, and I still struggle, but this list has sometimes helped slow me down or avoid a binge. I am currently in a binging spree and am also hoping that reaching out to others will help slow me down. Like most things, if this isn't helpful take what you need and leave the rest.

  
\-do the opposite. This initially feels disrespectfully simple, but I know that it isn't. I made a list of things that felt like the polar opposite of a binge. For me it was take a walk around the block, take a shower and put lotion on my whole body, and text a friend to make a plan (I don't tell them I am binging or struggling, just make a coffee/movie/catch up date in the next few weeks. Moving/get out of my space, treating my body with kindness, and getting out of head are all opposite of what leads up to a binge for me.

  
\-help lines. hit and miss for me, but help me become aware that I am ramping up and feel swallowed by an urge. ""You can contact the National Eating Disorders Helpline at (800) 931-2237 or **text “NEDA” to 741741""** sometimes I call and hang up. sometimes I text and then never respond. it is HARD and initially feels very confronting that I am admitting it's a problem and I am asking for help. like I said, hit and miss.

  
\-distract, delay, document. **distract** with anything that is relevant to you. go to a movie, draw your pet, leave your living space, watch your favorite episode of your favorite tv show, listen to your favorite album on a walk, go to the library, take a drive, clean your bathroom, put away the laundry, literally anything that applies to your life. Your distractions aren't the same as my distractions, find what works for YOU. **Delay**: say 'i will binge tomorrow' this might seem backwards, but SOMETIMES it helps the urge pass in the moment. I am not denying that I want it, but after a night's sleep I am sometimes able to have a clearer head the next day. I tend to binge at night, so this one is easier for me as I can usually just say 'go to bed.' **document** \- get a piece of paper and a pencil/pen, open your notes app, and write down every single moment and how you feel. what is happening while you are ramping up, ordering food, going to the grocery store to get food. how does it feel at the first bite? when your stomach starts to feel full? when you push past fullness? when you decide to stop? for me, this takes the thrill out of the whole experience. having to write it all down just makes it sooooooooo boring for me.

  
\-deleting accounts for delivery apps. sometimes I just make a new account but sometimes it's enough of a roadblock to stop me in that moment.

  
\-TIPP - stands for temperature (hot shower, cold shower, dunk your face in ice water), intense exercise (jumping jacks, run down the street and back, run up and down some stairs, shadow box), paced breathing (google some paced breathing guides), and progressive muscle relaxation (move from head to toe or toe to head tensing and relaxing every part of your body).

  
\-get your daily DOSE. Dopamine, oxytocin, seratonin, and endorphins. I also made a list of how to get each of these, and how to get those in my own living space. dopamine: clean my room, do the dishes, sweep. oxytocin: pet my cat. seratonin: watch my favorite show, listen to favorite album/playlist. endorphines: run down street and back, or plan on daily exercise like a walk or easy yoga video (fiton is free!).

  
\-personally, for me, I avoid this subreddit when I am in an urge. sometimes I feel a little bit motivated to binge if I am in an urge when I see content around binging. this is NOT mean to be rude or disrespectful to anybody on here, and I see how helpful this sub is to many when they are in moments of need. this is just something that I know helps me to avoid binge content when I am struggling myself.

  
None of this is foolproof. I often slam right past all of these and decide to binge. they are HARD to start, nothing on this list is meant to be presented as something easy. Believe me when I say I know that they are hard and the distance between wanting to binge and  trying these techniques is cavernous. It involves lots of personal inventory and swings and SO MANY LISTS. I just wanted to share in a means maybe help one person for one minute, and help me by reaching out when I am in a binging spree.

I have/had a handful of friends who always tell me about the bad/unsafe choices they make like they want me to validate them, or especially like it’s a competition.

“I’ve only had some toast in the morning for breakfast.”

“Well, *I’ve* only had coffee/a Red Bull/Monster Energy, so…”

I don’t know how to explain it. Like what am I supposed to say when they tell me they’ve spend the last 3 nights drinking and avoiding lectures? Or they’re like ‘aha I tried some random pills in a club from a stranger’ when they KNOW better? 

And on the other hand, I’m aware these behaviours might be indicative of serious issues, and I don’t want them to NOT tell me, but they get upset if I sound concerned or I tell them ‘I’m sorry’. 

I don’t know. I’m autistic and struggle with the *right* response so normally I just listen and lightly suggest better options (‘if you’re drinking all night, maybe have some full meals in the day?’) but inside I get frustrated with them. I don’t want to validate their dangerous choices. But I’m also aware they might be making those choices as a cry for help. It’s like watching someone you know knows how to swim flounder in a pool but they get annoyed when you throw a life buoy— even if they’re not accepting help, there’s still a chance they’re actually drowning!!

1jtrfn8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jtrfn8,Jibhi & Tirthan Valley: An Adventure with 38 Strangers,"The Beginning: Meeting at Kashmiri Gate

I just returned from a wholesome trip to the stunning landscapes of Tirthan Valley and Jibhi, and here's how it all started.

I was traveling with my friend and 38 strangers in a group. On Friday evening, our journey began from Delhi’s Kashmiri Gate metro station. At Gate No. 8, I met my trip captain. We had three trip coordinators, and all of them were really good.

Everyone in our group gathered at the station and boarded the bus. Our captain introduced himself and walked us through the itinerary. He mentioned there was a chance we might not be able to go on the Serolsar Lake trek due to black snow. That disappointed everyone for a moment, but he quickly lifted the mood and assured us that he would do his best to cover the full plan.

Breaking the Ice

After settling in, the trip captain encouraged everyone to introduce themselves — a fun activity that helped strangers connect. We had folks from Kanpur, people working at Deloitte and Optum, a few CAs, and some solo travelers. One solo traveler, a professor with a cheerful personality, stood out.

Around midnight, I decided to get some rest. But soon, loud music started playing and people began singing and dancing. I was initially annoyed, but it didn't take long for me to join in and vibe with the crowd. Dancing in a moving bus in the middle of the night was such a wholesome moment.

Eventually, we stopped for snacks and got some rest before continuing the journey.

Arrival at Tirthan Valley

The next morning, we woke up to breathtaking views of the Himalayan mountains and the Beas River. We reached Aut and then switched to traveler vehicles that took us to Gushaini, Tirthan Valley.

Our stay was right by the Tirthan River — peaceful and scenic. We crossed a small bridge to reach our property. I shared a ground-floor room with a solo traveler, whose stories about traveling fascinated me.

After freshening up, we had lunch by the river — a serene and refreshing setting.

Trekking to Chhoie Waterfall

Post-lunch, we went on a trek to Chhoie Waterfall. It was a short but steep trek with expanding village views as we climbed. We even saw a local stadium from above where people were playing cricket. After 2–3 hours, we reached the waterfall, which was tall and beautiful, with misty air all around.

We clicked pictures, had tea and momos, and later descended to the village. Our trip coordinators guided us to Mojo Cafe for snacks, where we enjoyed thin-crust pizza and coffee before heading back.

Bonfire and Chill Vibes

Back at the property, it was bonfire time — one of my favorite parts. We enjoyed music, singing, dancing, and unwinding with the group. Dinner followed, and then we called it a night.

Jalori Pass and Serolsar Lake Trek

The next morning, my friend and I went for a sunrise walk through the village, soaking in the views and taking pictures.

Then came the highlight: Jalori Pass. The 2-hour drive was filled with valley views and music. At Jalori, we had no mobile network, but I had downloaded songs and a speaker. Playing my playlist got me a lot of compliments.

We started the 4 km trek to Serolsar Lake. I became the ""speaker guy"" of the group, playing music the whole way. The trail was snowy and steep in parts, both beautiful and slightly tricky.

Our little group included me, my friend, the professor, two cousin sisters, and a couple. We bonded over conversations and KK songs. Reaching the frozen Serolsar Lake was magical. It was my first time seeing a frozen lake. We visited a temple nearby and played in the snow with the Optum group.

Lunch at the top included rajma chawal, Maggi, and tea. On the way back, we visited a 360-degree viewpoint to catch the sunset — a peaceful, unforgettable moment.

We returned to Jalori base by 8 PM, exhausted but full of memories, and reached our stay around 10 PM.

Jibhi Exploration and Farewell

On the last morning, my friend and I took another peaceful walk to the other side of the village, sitting by the river on rocks. After breakfast, we packed up and left for Jibhi.

In Jibhi, we visited “Mini Thailand,” a waterfall where we dipped our feet in the icy water — it felt like therapy. Later, we visited Jibhi Waterfall and relaxed there too.

After grabbing some tea, momos, and souvenirs near the waterfall, we had lunch at a cafe and then headed back to Aut to catch our Volvo.

As the bus took us back, I found myself replaying all the beautiful flashbacks — strangers who had become friends in just three days. Truly, it was a memorable and wholesome trip.

1jtrdth,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wolfstar/comments/1jtrdth/more_texting_fics/,More Texting Fics!,"If you recall, I posted about a bunch of texting fics like 3 months ago. I have continued to be obsessed, so here are some more for your consideration. [The Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wolfstar/comments/1hyokq1/texting_fics/)

First some self-recs because I was inspired by all the texting fics I read:

[Kinda Catfished](https://archiveofourown.org/works/61504918/chapters/157233199): Remus is texting an unknown number and they become friends. However, it turns out the number is actually the Marauders pulling a prank on him. They are bullies to start off with, but grow into lovely people as the story goes on. It starts with them in middle school in 2011 and goes until 2014. Lots of references to pop culture at that time and Doctor Who. Mix of prose and texting.

[Talk to Strangers!](https://archiveofourown.org/works/64424974/chapters/165414226): The boys meet on Omegle while the Marauders are trying to prank people. There's an instant connection, but they get to know each other better via text. It's mainly just a meet-cute one shot that leads into a mini texting fic.

[Missing: Remus's Balls](https://archiveofourown.org/works/64491301/chapters/165607267): My current WIP and my first fic that will be (almost) exclusively texting. Marlene put up a 'missing' poster while on vacation in California. The person missing? Remus's balls. He receives a text from Sirius and thus begins their long distance friendship that grows into something more. It is mainly fluff, but there are deeper moments that push the characters together.

\-

And here are some other texting fics I've read that I didn't rec on my first post (because I hadn't read them yet):

[The Unlikely Adventures of Hazard & Snuffles](https://archiveofourown.org/works/44411140): Just pure fluff. Very funny. Sirius is bad at texting and somehow manages to add a bunch of random contacts to a group chat. 



[Looking For An Outlet](https://archiveofourown.org/works/36702397): Remus is in his favorite coffee shop with a dying laptop and an online exam to finish. There's one outlet in the shop and someone extremely attractive already at the table. The texting is just Sirius panic texting James when he sees Remus. It is cute, funny, and short. 

[break up with your girlfriend, i'm bored](https://archiveofourown.org/works/35624731/chapters/88818520): This one isn't super texting heavy, but I wanted to include it. Remember at the Oscars when Andrew Garfield and Ryan Reynolds kissed? It starts out with that, but Wolfstar. Then comes some texting and flirting! Fun and silly. 

[A Perfect Place to Cry](https://archiveofourown.org/works/32479297/chapters/80548090): Sirius Black, famous singer, is in desperate need of some time off. He ventures to a small town and finds a phone number in a book at a second hand bookstore. With nothing else to do, he texts and slowly finds himself drawn to the mysterious man behind the screen. One of the tags is ""remus is a tad creepy but we love him for it"". Need I say more?

[Getaway Car](https://archiveofourown.org/works/30861236/chapters/76195025): modern wolfstar texting fic! (including dorlene and jily). no war, no death, none of that bc we rockin with happiness!!! the whole gang is 17-18 and go to a boarding school together. This fic uses a lot of text speak if that's your vibe ('u' instead of 'you' etc)

[keysmash](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20287849/chapters/48094258): Sirius texts a wrong number, Remus faces some fears, and things get better. Also uses a lot of text speak. It was a fun fic, mostly fluff. 

[the memerauders chat](https://archiveofourown.org/works/10472262): I feel like the name of this fic gives you the vibe. This fic also uses a lot of text speak.  Modern texting au with magic featuring puns, a betting pool, crop tops, and too many nudes, aka all the good things in life. A very light fluffy fic. And so many nudes happen. But not in a sexting way. I don't even know how to explain it. But if you want a very fluffy and silly fic, this would be good for you. 

[Across the Hall](https://archiveofourown.org/works/31157642/chapters/76996154): Sometimes, Sirius couldn't help but wish the person behind that number was really the person living in the dorm across from his. The only problem was... that person, Remus Lupin, absolutely hated him. Another horrible encounter with his mother may have led to him ""meet"" the person that could may or may not be the one for him. Filled with sarcasm, spilled coffee, and secret identities, Sirius texts the wrong number and naturally, the wrong number is Remus

[The Wolves of Census Division 23](https://archiveofourown.org/works/60304342/chapters/153899002): Someone commented this on the last one and I still haven't read it! Maybe this will be my next fic I read... A tattoo artist who needs attention. A wildlife filmmaker with the occasional wi-fi. It takes forty days for Sirius Black and Remus Lupin to fall in love. Well, no, that’s not true. It happens way faster than that. But it does take them forty days to realize it.



Goodness gracious I have read a lot of texting fics. Hope you enjoy!!!!

It felt like a kind and respectful gesture—something simple to acknowledge people around me. But today, something happened that made me question everything.

During my coffee break in the lounge, I was sitting alone, scrolling through my phone. Suddenly, he came and stood uncomfortably close to me. His presence felt off—almost eerie—but I brushed it off, thinking I might just be overthinking, as I often do.

Then, he leaned in, peering at my phone, and without warning, touched my back. The touch wasn’t casual or friendly—it immediately triggered a sense of alarm. I stood up and went straight back to my desk, trying to compose myself.

As I sat there, shaken, I kept replaying it in my mind. Was it my fault? Was being friendly and respectful a mistake? I never meant to give the wrong impression. I’m feeling confused, unsafe, and upset—wondering if I somehow invited this by simply being kind.",1,1744047921.0,confessions,1,1.0,False

I am looking for someone who I could ideally meet face-to-face here in London for example in a coffee shop to do 30-45mins in Catalan and 30-45mins in English.

Please let me know if you'd be interested, keen to start as soon as possible!

1jtrciz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MauiVisitors/comments/1jtrciz/yet_another_itinerary_check/,Yet Another Itinerary Check,"Heading to Maui for the first time for our honeymoon in June! We are staying at the Sheraton, we will have a rental car. I imagine we’ll start most mornings with coffee on the balcony and end most days at a restaurant with a view or watching the sunset on the beach/from our balcony. Open to any advice on what needs to be changed or if we missed anything. Not huge hikers and trying to limit windshield time where we can. Appreciate everyone's insight!

**Monday, Day 1:** 

* Land 12:30pm, get rental car
* Get Tin Roof
* Grocery Store for snacks/drinks to have in room
* Hotel Check In
* Dinner at hotel or close by (prob walk to Maui Brewing or Whalers Village)

**Tuesday, Day 2:** 

* Beach day (Black Rock)

**Wednesday, Day 3:** 

* Cafe O'Lei at the Plantation (get resy for 12:00)
* Ocean Vodka (should we move this and watch sunset here after Mama’s instead?) 
* Haleakala sunset, stay for stars (would rather do this later in the week for jet leg purposes but based on moon phases this is the best day for stars which is my fiancé's must-do.)

**Thursday, Day 4:**

* Beach Day (base on snorkel report)

**Friday, Day 5:**

* Beach day (Most likely) or RTH depending on what we're feeling

**Saturday, Day 6**

* Ho’okipa Beach just to see surfers/turtles before dinner
* Mama’s Fish House (Resy at 4:15) 
* Worth stopping in Paia for shopping before dinner/Ho’okipa? 

**Sunday, Day 7**

* Beach Day (Base on snorkel report)

**Monday, Day 8**

* Revisit any favorites or spots we didn’t make it to yet
* Hoping to secure late check-out but may have hotel hold luggage depending on what we decide to do!
* Depart at 8pm, arrive at airport to drop rental car by 5:30pm

We never go to Wailea in this itinerary, will we regret this? Don’t really care about another fancy meal or high end shopping. Again, avoiding driving where possible, is it worth it?

We have some activities in our back pocket in case we feel like doing something other than the beach but aren't ""must do"": Iao Valley, Maui Chocolate, Trilogy Sunset Sail, Kapalua Trail/Dragon's Teeth/Enchanted Forest, Nakalele Blowhole

Food we’ve got on our list to try but probably won’t make reservations for until the week of or just walk in depending on what we’re feeling in the moment: Monkeypod, Miss Arepa, Maui Brewing, Aloha Mixed Plate, Fish Market Maui, Star Noodle, Island Vintage, Island Cream Co, Ululani’s, Papi's Ohana, Merriman’s (already doing Mama’s so would probably just do drinks/apps at the Point), Castaway Cafe. We also love a food truck!",0,1744047835.0,MauiVisitors,0,0.5,False
1jtrat6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jtrat6/i_have_strong_anxiety_with_physyical_symptoms/,I have strong anxiety with physyical symptoms,"I was prescribed Lexapro but I could not start yet cause I have very strong anxiety with bad physycal symptoms, short of breath, hard to swallow, etc. I have conversion disorder symptoms. I have also ETD, problems with my ears that causes me anxiety. loud noises, speaker on the phone causes my anxiety. I can sleep well without meds.

I dont want to start Lexapro yet because I am afraid it might worsen my symptoms.

I tried medazepam 2.5mg. It just sedates me does not stop my symptoms. i have low blood pressure. I will start Lexapro but till I start it I want to take something that would ease my anxiety and my symptoms. I am not angry, not nervous, just have strong anxiety.

Even if I take calcium it really sedates me. I probably have low serotonine and dopamine levels. I can not take any stress, cant watch tv, read, etc.

I dont know if Xanax or medazepam could help me more before I start Lexapro.



 I feel that 2.5mg of medazepam over sedates me. Even 48 hours later I still feel too slow and tired and need to drink a lot of coffee.

Does anyone have any experience with Lexapro or Xanax? How did you start it?",1,1744047714.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False
1jtrars,https://v.redd.it/bpvfz6459gte1,No milk latte tutorial,"A few people asked to show how I made the “no milk latte “ using steamed espresso so here’s a video of me making one. For better contrast and flavor I’d recommend a dedicated double shot for both the “milk” and the cup but I didn’t want to waste coffee redoing this. I spilled like half of this on my counter but the texture was fine and the art was visible enough so I think this is fine enough for demo purposes …. This is actually really nice to work with and if you don’t rush I think you could get some pretty complex art out of this. 

All you do is put a shot into a pitcher add water up to the lip add a small ice cube and steam like you would milk until you don’t feel the ice cube hitting the steam wand anymore and BAM no milk latte! Hope this helps enjoy!!

Hackwood Café doesn’t mess about. You want proper breakfasts? They've got sausages the size of your forearm and bacon so crispy it might fight back.

We’re talking *Farmhouse Breakfasts* that leave no plate space unused, breakfast sandwiches stacked like Jenga, and a “Healthy Option” for anyone still clinging to January’s resolutions.

Afternoon tea? Absolutely. Finger sarnies, mini Victoria sponges, and scones so fluffy they should be illegal. Add Prosecco if the kids are doing your head in.

Hot meat sandwiches, stacked burgers, toasties, quiche — it's comfort food with zero regrets and proper portions. Come hungry. Leave slower.

You ever had fish and chips so good it made you rethink every takeaway you’ve ever ordered? That’s The Cow Dalbury.

This isn’t microwaved mash and mystery gravy — it’s crispy beer-battered hake, Thai pea purée, pan-seared scallops, and rump steak that actually tastes like steak. Even the mushy peas are minted. Literally.

Starters bring the heat with paprika cockles and tempura prawns. Mains flex everything from Crab Mac & Cheese to a Surf & Turf that could turn a vegetarian. And don’t skip dessert — that Guinness chocolate pot could revive a corpse.

It’s countryside comfort with city-level flavour. Get a table. Then cancel whatever sad dinner plan you had before this.

If your kids have more energy than a bag of Haribo, this place is your new best mate. We’re talking trampolines, obstacle courses, dodgeball, foam pits, giant airbags, soft play for the tiny ones, and a ninja course that'll humble most dads.

It’s chaos. It’s loud. It’s brilliant.

**Ideal for the Easter holidays** when staying sane at home is no longer an option. Let them bounce themselves tired while you sip coffee and pretend you’re on a spa day. Bonus: the staff actually seem to enjoy the madness.

Warning: once they go once, they’ll want to live there.

I was prescribed Lexapro but I could not start yet cause I have very strong anxiety with bad physycal symptoms, short of breath, hard to swallow, etc. I have conversion disorder symptoms. I have also ETD, problems with my ears that causes me anxiety. loud noises, speaker on the phone causes my anxiety. I can sleep well without meds.

I dont want to start Lexapro yet because I am afraid it might worsen my symptoms.

I tried medazepam 2.5mg. It just sedates me does not stop my symptoms. i have low blood pressure. I will start Lexapro but till I start it I want to take something that would ease my anxiety and my symptoms. I am not angry, not nervous, just have strong anxiety.

Even if I take calcium it really sedates me. I probably have low serotonine and dopamine levels. I can not take any stress, cant watch tv, read, etc.

I dont know if Xanax or medazepam could help me more before I start Lexapro.



 I feel that 2.5mg of medazepam over sedates me. Even 48 hours later I still feel too slow and tired and need to drink a lot of coffee.

Does anyone have any experience with Lexapro? How did you start it?",1,1744047643.0,antidepressants,0,1.0,False

If the vibes are there, I ask her if she wants to grab a bite, and I always suggest Chinese or Japanese food.

Most of the time, they go along with my idea. 

During this, I ask her if she knows how to use chopsticks, most of the time they say no. I ask them if they want me to teach them and they say yes.

I ask for their hand and pretty much just play with their hand and fingers trying to get the chopsticks in the right position. I always confess this was just an excuse to touch their hand and every time I got a positive response.

I either get ""I know, that's why I let you do it"" or they just smile and make a joke about it. 

Every time I did this, the conversation turns more flirty and fun, and I've always snagged at a second date, and at least a kiss some time later. Idk if this had anything to do with it, but it certainly never seemed to hurt.

I unfortunately have to part ways with my apartment that has a lease until September 30th, 2025. The landlord informed me that they can renew directly with any subletter. It makes me sad because this is the best apartment I've ever had, especially given the price.  
  
The apartment is a 1 bedroom 1.5 bathroom duplex around 900 square feet with an additional 900 square foot PRIVATE backyard. The bedroom has ample room as well.  
  
Building manager is super chill and the super comes quickly. Rarely dealt with any issues but if things did arise, they were alway on time.  
  
Apartment Details:  
1. Apartment will come unfurnished  
2. Heating/Cooling is pre-installed wall units.  
3. FIOS is available for internet  
4. New/modern amenities (dishwasher as well)  
5. Laundry can be done at the building next door. There's also a laundromat literally across the street (Panda laundry) that does great/cheap drop off service.  
6. Building is small, only 4 floors with 2 units per floor.  
7. Bedroom can easily fit a queen size. Picture shows a full size with a dresser.  
  
Location details:  
1. Cross streets are Wyckoff and Harman - close to the L (Dekalb). FM is also close by (10 minute walk).  
2. Ample grocery very close by (Windsor market, Mr.Lemon, Key Foods) as well as butcher, liquor store, and bodegas all around  
3. You're close to the bar areas of Bushwick, but not too close that you'll be in the middle of crowds. 12 minute walk to House of Yes.  
4. Street is quiet and the unit is very quiet in general.  
5. Lots of fun neighborhood bars (Honore club, Old Stanleys, Abe's pagoda, Lou's social club, etc)  
6. 10 minute walk to Maria Hernandez Park  
7. Amazing restaurants, coffee shop etc - all the perks of Bushwick  
  
Security Deposit is the only thing outside of rent required.  
  
Honestly, a perfect apartment that checks so many boxes. Sad to be leaving it. Excited for the next person to experience this place.

To write is sometimes to wax poetic

Organized, stylized, hypnotized by lines

At times so boxed in by unwritten laws

Acting like we must abide by or do time

And yet also freeflow, perhaps rhythmic

But lax, a cadence mayhap; or mayhem

chaos grammatical attacks and quickly written long lines divided from the ordered world above it only by empty space void the blackest and blankest black

Before back to the confines of syntax

And syllable counts, metronome clicking

In the dome of bone our brain calls home

And so so competitive with what’s written

We form committees and meet in all cities

And contest and critique, expected to listen

to the rambling chaos of art critiques so say who ramble nothings and grasp at the straws in their coffee cups critiquing a vision they cannot divine with blind eyes with unearned wisdom with feeble minds and pointed tongues and yet they are just caricature overdone derivative written, painted sculpted and then bitten by others who repeat the same work with new titles like “artist” and “poet” and say it was theirs from the beginning

So competitive, we want to stay ahead

Like athletics, training for big events

Pushing mind like muscle until we are dead

Olympic in gravitas, no oversight, no limits

Performance enhancers not encouraged, yet

Nothing prohibited, no more sleep, wasted

on the rushing thumping chaos again we have learned the rules and now we can break them so easily - the lawyers break laws most successfully and a needles pinprick filled with clear liquid straight from your heart to your head and now you inspired where once you were trash your art all garbage and your drive nonexistent your mind is open knowledge spills from your pen like the blood that stays flowing from the veins torn open but you are unworried you mold chaos into form and function freeform to any form you feel ascended until al of a sudden the train ride     is        over       now      
    leave        the        station

No more rhymes save one nearly

In this second line but not a single

Line left to light a fire and jolt

Your brain back to one hundred

And ten percent your left with

Abscess and illness and wonder

did i ever have talent?

It is absolutely insane what's possible with this API. How does the universe even deserve it? 😄

Key points about the audio engine:

* Comprehensive mixer with unlimited channels, sends, groups, inserts
* 23 quality insert FX
* Advanced, intuitive modular synth (Hybris) with 34 module types
* Dynamic audio graph (nodes are added and disposed of as needed for dynamic voice allocation)
* Smart node caching to reduce allocations of nodes
* Extremely well optimized (partly of course due to the amazing work of the Chromium developers); heavy productions (20 modular synth instances with dozens of voices playing, 65 insert FX) can be run at low latency on the cheapest laptop from Currys with very rare buffer underruns; average CPU usage 5% (not a typo)
* Low RAM usage on Chromium (\~ 250 MB for the above production, including multiple drum and vocal samples, and all UI and logic for the sequencer); memory leaks in Chromium exist, but are worked around (and have been reported and confirmed, so possibly fixed soon)
* Audio Engine codebase consists of \~11,000 lines of reasonable-quality Tea (my own CoffeeScript 1 dialect) code
* All audio automation and oscillator / LFO sync is sample-accurate by ensuring all dynamic node configuration and parameter changes are always (slightly) in the future (even for live play)

Note that this is **not** open-source, but I would possibly consider it if there's enough (or even **any** 😄) interest, and possibly at least **some** form of compensation.

I can probably post random short snippets of code if people are interested!

1jtquss,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jtquss/thoughts_on_modding_out_gaggia/,Thoughts on modding out Gaggia?,"Asking for my own benefit but curious what the sentiment here is. I’m considering going down that path but if you buy the kits and various equipment/mods you might want, the price gets less and less impressive. 

If you buy a new GCP, it’s around $500 or $350 for refurbished. Then for a Gaggiuino or Gaggia Mate kit, it’s anywhere from $200-400. If you want to upgrade the steam nob, drip tray, new spring, wand tip, etc. that can range quite a lot too, I’ll round it off to $100 but I know I personally would want more than that lol.

So at the low end, it’s around $650 (plus shipping on all the separate individual products) and at the high end it’s $1000+. Obviously you can cut costs but doing more stuff yourself but if electronics, 3D printing, etc. isn’t your thing though, it can be hard to quantify the time cost. Plus there is a risk that you mess something up and now you’re out every dollar you put into it lol. 


With that in mind, is modding it out worth while? Is the end result closer to a Decent quality for the cost of a Profitec? If your goal is just a present machine and good coffee, are you better off just getting an Odyssey Argos? 

For anyone who’s modded out a GCP before, did you feel like the act of modding taught you a lot about espresso? I could definitely see it being a okay value proposition but a great learning experience. Interested in hearing people’s thoughts!",2,1744046650.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

I'm a longtime lurker, but this is my first time posting! 

I've been in a long-term gay MM relationship, and in recent years, my PP and I have been engaging in pretty light outside-of-relationship play that we'd agreed on. Online chat rooms and encounters in the gym steam room, stuff like that. In November, I had a particularly hot hook up at the gym, and I continued to see the guy every couple of weeks until the beginning of March, when we finally exchanged numbers, started texting, and went to have coffee. Beyond our initial amazing sexual chemistry, we immediately locked in intellectually and emotionally, and have seen each other twice a week since. He and I live with our partners and have busy schedules, but we have made it work.  We see each other for a few hours here and there and occasionally get a hotel room for an afternoon. Throughout the day, we are constantly texting. I have only felt this type of connection with another person a few times in my life, with one other romantic partner (not my current partner) and 3 of my best friends.

I love my PP so much, but deep down in my heart, it isn't the right relationship. I've known this for years, and meeting my AP has highlighted that.  I still love my PP and feel like he is part of my family. My AP, on the other hand, has a much more outwardly unhappy relationship with his PP, which I'm sympathetic to, but I  know that that shouldn't affect my feelings or how I treat my [PP.My](http://PP.My) PP has always said that I should be upfront and honest with him if things change, and given my usual feelings about the hookups I had been having, there was no reason to sound the alarm about wanting to see anyone seriously or change our arrangement. 

The situation with my AP is still new, and I'm scared it might blow up. While he's been incredibly kind and wonderful to me, part of me thinks it's too good to be true. I had been love-bombed by previous relationships before the relationship I'm currently in and am a little paranoid. If I'm being honest, I have been nonstop fantasizing about what my life with my AP would be like. I don't know where this relationship is going, but it's making me realize my PP and I don't have a spark left and are living like roommates, which is an issue in and of itself.  While my PP is open to other arrangements, my AP's PP is very anti-him seeing people outside the relationship. 

I do think my PP is getting a little suspicious since my behavior and habits have changed. Should I talk to him about what's happening, or should I wait a little longer to sus it out? I think my biggest fear is that if he knew, he'd limit how much I could see/ what I would be ""allowed"" to do with my AP, which feels so painful. 

  
**TL-DR:** Should I talk to my PP, who is open to nonmonogamy, about my AP, even if I'm unsure where the relationship is heading or wait?

I’ve recently purchased a Cup One machine. While reading the manual, I noticed comments discouraging the use of reverse osmosis water. I live in the desert and have an R/O system since our tap water doesn’t taste good. I’ve been using Nespresso machines for the past 5+yrs and I’ve never had issues with scale/mineral build-up (most likely) due to the use of R/O water. I always used an all-in-one liquid descaler/cleaner in place of the Nespresso branded powder and never had issues.

Moving on to the Moccasmaster, they recommend Urnex descaling and cleaning powders which are “conveniently” sold for “household use” in individual use packets. However, Urnex also sells cleaning and descaling tablets in much larger more affordable quantities but claims they’re for “professional” use, while at the same time their product listing shows compatibility with Moccamaster in addition to Keurig, Nespresso, etc.. I called both companies and they each referred me to the other when pressed with questions. I’m all about getting a long life out of my Moccamaster and I want good tasting coffee, but I’m also not interested in signing up for the equivalent of another over-priced subscription service. Does anyone use the tablets instead of the powder?

Life wasn't a fairytale. I learned that at five when Mom died, and again at twelve when Lisa, my step-mother moved in with her perfect daughter Chloe. At first, Lisa was kind to me, but soon she began showing her true, darker side. Chloe and I were the same age, but Lisa made sure that Chloe received all the attention from both her and my dad.

After a few months, I noticed how Dad started to ignore me as he got caught up in his ""perfect"" new family. Over time, I became just an extra, unwanted family member that no one cared about.

My only happy place was with my maternal grandparents, who lived in Italy. We made sure to visit each other whenever we could. Besides my grandparents, I loved only two other people in the world as much as my family—my childhood best friends, Jessica Martin and Adrian Parker. The three of us were inseparable until Adrian moved to a boarding school in London.

Jessica and I stayed close and kept in touch with Adrian every weekend. However, as soon as I started high school, Jessica began to ignore me, preferring to hang out with Chloe instead. Soon, they became best friends, and even Adrian stopped replying to my messages and calls.

As time passed, everyone around me seemed to compare me to Chloe or other girls. Lisa constantly insulted my looks and clothes and made sure others treated me the same way. Even my dad started to see me as a disgrace.

As little girls, we're often told stories of distressed damsels who need saving. But as I grew older, I realized I didn't need a Prince Charming to save me.

The only person capable of saving me was myself. I needed to become a strong, independent woman and stand up for myself.

I was clear about my future and goals by the time I finished high school. I worked hard to get into a top university, and my efforts paid off.

Five years later, Harvard's diploma gleamed on my wall. I'd traded starvation for strength, tears for titanium resolve. Even my reflection shocked me—waist-length hair, curves Ester swore made men trip, and eyes that no longer flinched.

Tomorrow, I'll be leaving Boston and returning to NYC after almost five years. During this time, neither my family nor Jessica or Adrian tried to contact me. My grandfather offered financial support, but I barely touched it.

As I packed my belongings and prepared for the airport, I tied my hair into a ponytail and examined my reflection in the mirror. My brown hair now cascaded down to my waist; I used to prefer short hair until high school. My round face was almost bare, with minimal makeup. My glasses were gone, and my hazel eyes, framed by thick lashes, were perfectly coated with mascara.

After taking one last look in the mirror, I grabbed my belongings and called a cab. Soon, I was on my way to the airport, hoping that everything would go well.

Little did I know, this journey back to NYC was going to turn my life upside down.

Chapter 2

It's been a week since I arrived in NYC. As soon as I landed in my birthplace, I got busy unpacking and setting up my home. This house was bought by my mother before she died. She wanted to keep it as a home, yet now, no family member is here with me today.

My family knew about my arrival, but no one had tried to meet me or contact me.

I brushed off those thoughts and continued sipping my coffee while sitting in the living room when I heard my phone ring.

I quickly stood up and grabbed the phone lying on the desk. A smile formed on my li-ps when I saw the name on the screen, and I answered the call.

""Hello, Grandpa! How are you? How is Grandma doing?""

""We're both fine, dear. How are you? Have you settled into your new home?"" he asked excitedly.

""Yes, Grandpa, I've settled in. I just wish you both were here with me,"" I replied, a bit sadly, making my grandpa chuckle.

""We'll be coming to visit you in a days, sweetheart. It's time I finally hand over the company to you,"" Grandpa said in a serious tone.

""Yes, Grandpa, I remember that. I just hope I can handle the responsibilities well.""

""You'll do great, my dear. You're perfect for leading the company,"" Grandpa assured me.

My grandpa, Stephen D'Amario never trusted my father—not after Mom died, and certainly not after he let Lisa and Chloe destroy what was left of our family. D’Amario Enterprises was Grandpa’s life’s work, meant for Mom, then for me. But after her cancer diagnosis, Dad took over, and Lisa made sure I’d never be fit to inherit it.

""You’re not university material,"" Dad sneered when I applied to colleges, parroting Lisa’s words. Yet I kept my grades up, clinging to one truth: the company would be mine at twenty-one.

The memories still clawed at me.

FLASHBACK

Jessica and Chloe barged into my room, their laughter sharp as knives. ""Ugly bit-ch,"" Jessica spat.

A book slammed into my face. Blood bloomed on my face. Then fists, nails, spit—each blow driving home my worthlessness. They destroyed my homework last, shredding it with glee.

""Know your place,"" Chloe hissed before slamming the door.

Alone, I sobbed, then rewrote the assignment until dawn. Weak. Pathetic.

FLASHBACK ENDS

I exhaled, flexing my hands—no longer trembling. At Harvard, I’d traded fear for fists. I even learned basic self-defence there.

Seeing how strong and decisive I am today gives me the confidence to take on the responsibility of being the heiress of D'Amario Enterprises.

Chapter 3

Adrian P.O.V

I've always gotten everything I wanted in life—from money to power, I had the finest of it all.

At 25, I'm one of the most successful businessmen in the country. Two years ago, my dad entrusted me with the full responsibility of the company, and today, it's one of the leading corporations in the USA. But the best part of my life is the love of my life, Jessica Martin. She's everything a man could ever ask for.

I've known Jessica since we were about 5 years old, but at 12, I moved to a boarding school in London. Despite the distance, Jessica and I always stayed in contact, and she supported me through every up and down.

During vacations, we always made sure to spend time together. I even remember Sarah, who used to be a good friend of ours. But after I moved to London, she started ignoring Jessica and even asked her to stay away from me. Jessica always told me how Sarah bullied her in high school.

As time went on, Jessica only grew more beautiful, both inside and out. Two years ago, after I took over the company, I asked her to be my girlfriend. With her, my life felt complete—she was not only pretty but also incredibly intelligent and talented. She was one of the top students in school and even got a scholarship to Harvard, but she chose to follow her pass-ion for modeling. Today, she's one of the highest-paid models in the industry.

My thoughts were interrupted by a knock on my office door. Without looking up, I told the person to come in.

I heard the click of heels on the floor and caught the familiar scent of perfume. Jessica walked towards me and sat on my desk.

""Good afternoon, love,"" I said, moving closer and taking her hands in mine.

""Hey, babe,"" she replied seductively, placing her other hand on my che-st.

""How was your day?"" I asked. She started telling me about her photoshoot that morning while I admired the beauty sitting before me. She looked amazing in that fitted white dress, her blond mid-length hair perfectly styled and falling onto her shoulders. As a model, she had a flawlessly toned body. She was perfect, and I was the luckiest man to have her in my life.

""Adrian, what are you wearing to your parents' wedding anniversary?""

""I want our outfits to coordinate since that's when you'll tell your parents about us,"" she said as she adjusted my tie.

""Well, you don't need to worry about that, love. My secretary has taken care of our outfits. You'll get the dress by tomorrow,"" I replied.

""Aww, thank you so much,"" she said happily. ""Now, if you're done with work, can we go home?""

""Sure, babe. Let me just call my secretary,"" I said, moving toward the phone to inform Josh of my departure.

I put on my coat, took Jessica's hand, and we interlocked our fingers as we walked toward the elevator.

I headed to my black Bugatti Veyron, opening the door for Jessica before jogging to the driver's seat. After starting the car, I soon stopped at a lavish Italian restaurant for dinner.

We chose a seat in the corner of the restaurant, and started discussing our future plans.

""Do you think your parents will accept our relationship?"" Jessica asked while sipping her wine.

""I don't think your mother is fond of me,"" she added as I narrowed my eyes.

""Why do you feel that way, Jess?""

""Ever since you came back from London, I've tried to talk to her, but she always ends up bringing up Sarah in the conversation.""

""She keeps telling me how sweet and kind Sarah is and how the three of us should hang out together like old times,"" Jessica said in a sad tone.

My jaw clenched at the mention of Sarah's name. What she did to Jessica was enough for me to hate her for the rest of my life.

""Sarah doesn't deserve to be our friend after what she did to you when I was gone. My mom doesn't know how ug-ly her true face is. Once she finds out, she'll stop talking about her,"" I replied angrily.

Even remembering how Sarah treated Jessica made my blood boil. Because of her, Jessica had to endure so many difficulties and traumas.

""Relax, babe. She's gone now. We don't have to worry about her,"" Jessica assured me, caressing my hand.

I smiled at her as the waiter brought our dinner. We ate while discussing the arrangements for my parents' anniversary party. Once we were done, I paid the bill, and we drove back to my penthouse.

I moved out of my parent's house two years ago and bought my place. After Jessica and I started dating, I asked her to move in with me. She's partially moved in, but she hasn't fully moved in yet.

As soon as we stepped into the penthouse, I slammed my li-ps against Jessica's. I grabbed her hair, causing her to tilt her head back, and I started kissing her neck hungrily, making her moan loudly.

Soon, we ended up on the couch. By this time, I had successfully removed her dress. She lay beneath me in her black lingerie, looking at me seductively as she started unbuttoning my shirt. Once she removed my shirt, followed by my pants, she took my member in her hand and began stroking it.

The room filled with our loud moans.

We ended up going for a second round and then showered together. Afterwards, we were so exhausted that we went straight to bed. I hugged her tightly in my arms, and soon, we both fell asleep.

Chapter 4

Adrian P.O.V

The past few days have been chaotic, as my parents' wedding anniversary is approaching. I've been busy with the arrangements for the party. It's also the day I plan to officially tell my parents about Jessica and my intention to marry her by the end of the year.

I even bought a ring for Jessica. If everything goes well, I'll propose to her at the party in front of everyone.

I looked up when I heard a knock on my office door and saw my father, James Parker, walking in with a serious expression.

""How are you, son? We hardly see you these days. Your mom misses you a lot,"" he said, sitting on the couch.

""I've just been caught up with work, Dad. I'll definitely visit Mom today,"" I replied while scanning some important files.

""I need to discuss something important with you. It's about the company."" I put my file down and turned to face him, waiting for him to continue.

""Since you've taken over the company, your mother and I think it's time for you to settle down. You'll be turning 26 this year, and we believe it's time for you to get married.""

Hearing this, I thought it was the perfect moment to tell him about Jessica, but before I could, he continued.

""We've decided you should marry the granddaughter of Stephen D'Amario. She's the heiress of the D'Amario family. Mr D'Amario was a close friend of your grandfather, so it would be a perfect match,"" my father revealed with a big smile.

I was in complete shock. I couldn't imagine marrying anyone other than Jessica.

""No, Dad, I don't want to marry anyone else. I've already decided what I want in life, and marrying some heiress isn't part of it,"" I said angrily.

""In that case, the company will be transferred to Mr. D'Amario's granddaughter. Your grandfather and Mr. D'Amario signed an agreement that you and his granddaughter must marry, allowing the Parker and D'Amario companies to merge for mutual benefit,"" he said calmly.

""I'm still not marrying her. To he-ll with this danm agreement!"" I snapped angrily.

""Oh, son, you must marry her. If you refuse, 40% of Parker Enterprises will go to her. If she refuses, 40% of D'Amario Enterprises will come to us. If you both refuse, 50% of each company's shares will go to charity,"" he explained.

I heaved a big sigh, annoyed and worried about how to explain this to Jessica. Every plan I made for us seemed to be crumbling.

""I'll leave now; your mother is probably waiting for me,"" he said, walking out of my office.

As I pondered this new problem, my phone rang. It was Jessica. I answered, and her sweet voice came through the line.

""Hey, babe! Are you still at the office? Did you forget about our date night at my place?"" she asked.

I had completely forgotten about the date night due to my busy schedule, but I quickly covered my negligence.

""Of course, love. I can't wait to see you,"" I said, smirking at the thought of holding her in my arms tonight.

""Alright, see you at 7 then. Bye, love you,"" she said.

""Love you too, babe."" I hung up and went back to thinking about how to handle this marriage situation. How would Jessica react?

I immediately called my best friend, Noah. He's the COO of Parker Enterprises. We met in boarding school, and we've been best friends ever since.

I picked up the intercom and called my secretary. ""Could you please ask Mr. Andrews to come to my office immediately?""

Within 10 minutes, Noah walked in. ""Hey, everything good?"" he asked as he sat down across from me.

""My father wants me to marry Mr. D'Amario's granddaughter, or else the company goes to charity.""

""What?! No way. We've worked so hard for the company these past two years. It would all be wasted if it goes to charity,"" Noah exclaimed. ""What about Jessica? Did you tell her?""

""Not yet, bro. I'm planning to tell her tonight,"" I replied, massaging my temples.

""Isn't D'Amario Enterprises owned by Neil Darrell?"" Noah asked.

I immediately realized he was right. ""If Neil Darrell is running D'Amario Enterprises, then the granddaughter I'm supposed to marry is Chloe Darrell,"" I said, connecting the dots.

""Exactly. You can talk to Jessica about this. She can easily convince Chloe to refuse the proposal since they're best friends,"" Noah suggested.

""That's what I was thinking. I need to get to Jessica's place now."" I quickly left the office and headed to Jessica's apartment.

I arrived and rang the bell. Within seconds, she opened the door. A smile formed on my face as I saw her. She wrapped her arms around my shoulders and kissed me. I kissed her back passionately. Soon, we were undressed and made our way to the bedroom. After hours of being together, we finally went downstairs for dinner.

I or-dered sushi since Jessica can barely cook. To be honest, she's a terrible cook—she can hardly boil water—but she's perfect in every other way, and she's all I want.

We finished dinner, talking about our day when I suddenly remembered the conversation with my dad.

""Babe, I need to tell you something important,"" I said, holding her hands close to my che-st.

I explained the entire situation, from the marriage proposal to the merger, and the consequences if we backed out.

Before I could tell her about Chloe, she snapped at me angrily, ""So you want to leave me and marry some random brat now?""

""No, babe, the only person I want to marry is you. I can't even think of marrying someone else,"" I reassured her.

""And this marriage won't happen. All you need to do is convince Chloe to refuse the proposal.""

""Chloe? What does she have to do with this proposal?"" she asked.

""She's the granddaughter I'm supposed to marry, and since she's your best friend, you can easily convince her to refuse,"" I explained.

A smile formed on her li-ps, and she hugged me tightly.

""That can be done easily. She's dating Justin now, so I doubt she'd ever want to marry you,"" she said happily.

""And I'll never marry or love anyone but you,"" I told her, pressing my kiss to her forehead.

Chapter 5

Sarah P.O.V

I felt tense and doomed after hearing what Grandpa and Grandma told me. They arrived in the States last night, and today they've given me the biggest shock of my life.

According to them, I must marry for the merger or lose a 40% share of Amario Enterprises. Before they could finish their next sentence, I slammed my hands on my lap and stood up.

""I can't accept this proposal, Grandpa. I just graduated, and right now, I want to explore new things. I don't want to get married so soon.""

""Sweetheart, we're not forcing you, but we want someone strong to take care of you. Grandpa and I are getting old, dear; we won't always be here to support you. That's why we want you to be secure and happy,"" Grandma said, making me sit down again as she held my hands.

I thought about everything happening. When it comes to marriage, love, respect, and trust are the pillars of happiness.

I've always been nervous about relationships, scared of rejection and being unloved.

I feared I'd be the one trying to maintain the relationship while the other person didn't care.

""Sarah, we always want what's best for you. But remember, if you reject this proposal, the company will be ruined. This company was your mother's dream. Sophia worked hard to bring it to where it is today. But honey, we don't want to force you,"" Grandpa said, comforting me.

Thinking about my mother, I wondered what she would do in my place. Would she accept this to save the company? She worked tirelessly until her illness confined her to bed.

""Grandpa, I need to think this over. I'll let you know my decision soon,"" I said with a weak smile and left.

I went to my room and closed the door. I lay on my bed, replaying the conversation with Grandpa and Grandma.

I never thought I'd get married so soon, let alone just for the sake of the company. But deep down, I knew this company held my mother's memories, her hard work, and her dream of making Amario Enterprises one of the leading companies in the world.

I always thought that when I married, it would be for love, not a business arrangement.

I never had time to date in high school; I was always busy with studies and a part-time job. If any guy tried to ask me out, Chloe and Jessica made sure I never went.

I still remember the night after graduation when there was a party at our house.

FLASHBACK

I was in my room, checking my email about the applications I had submitted to various universities. I could hear the loud music coming from downstairs.

Chloe had invited everyone to the party. She even asked me to join, but I politely declined, knowing she and Jessica would likely have a plan to humiliate me again.

Suddenly, I heard a knock on my door. I closed my laptop and walked over. Opening it, I saw Justin standing there, holding two cans of beer.

""Hey, Sarah!"" he greeted me and walked into my room, sitting on my bed and looking around.

""Hey, Justin! What brings you here?"" I asked, walking towards him.

Justin was in the same grade as me and Chloe. He was one of the popular guys in high school. We weren't close friends, but we had worked on some projects and assignments together. He seemed like a genuine guy.

""Why are you sitting here alone? Why didn't you come downstairs and join us?"" he asked.

""Well, I don't like loud music, and I'm not used to these parties. Besides, I had some important work to do,"" I told him.

""Oh, that's alright. Everyone has their own tastes and choices,"" he said, offering me one of the beers he was holding. I politely declined.

""C'mon, relax a bit, Sarah. One beer won't harm you,"" he chuckled.

I hesitated but eventually accepted the beer and took a sip.

One beer won't harm me.

""So, what are your plans after high school?"" he asked, drinking his beer.

""Well, I'm planning to study architecture, but I haven't decided which university to choose.""

Before I could say more, I started feeling dizzy. I could hear Justin talking, but I couldn't understand what he was saying.

I could faintly hear Chloe and Jessica's voices inside the room. I heard them talking, but I couldn't make out the words.

Jessica's voice came closer as she whispered in my right ear.

""Let's have some fun, Sarah,"" she said, laughing wickedly.

I tried to get up, but Chloe pushed me back onto the bed. My T-shirt was yanked off aggressively, and my jeans were pulled down. I tried to shout for help, but no words came out. I could hear Chloe, Jessica, and Justin giggling.

I was lying there in just my underwear. Someone pulled me closer, and I heard Justin whisper something in my ear. All I could understand was that they were up to something terrible.

Justin gripped my waist, then started svcking on my neck.

""Please... don't,"" I begged them.

But they didn't stop. After a few minutes, I heard Jessica say it was enough; they'd gotten what they wanted.

I sighed in relief, but then I felt someone tugging at my hair. Before I could react, they started cutting it. I struggled with what little energy I had left, but a sharp kick to my ribs knocked me out.

FLASHBACK ENDS

When I regained consciousness, it was already the next day. I was still on the bed, my underwear tor-n. When I looked in the mirror, I saw bruises around my ribs and belly. My hair was nearly all gone—I was almost bald.

Jessica, Justin, and Chloe had made a video of me and Justin in bed. In the video, only my face was visible, while only Justin's back was shown.

They shared the video on every social media platform, and the whole school assumed I had shot it and shared it to gain popularity.

I even told Dad, but he blamed me for not being careful. Later, he chose to believe others, thinking I had purposely shared the video.

A tear slipped down my cheek, but I quickly wiped it away. Because of that night, I couldn't trust any guy. Although I managed to overcome this fear when I moved to Boston, becoming more comfortable around new people, I still struggled.

I even went on a few dates, but things never progressed. I was still uncomfortable with intimacy and trusting anyone.

Thinking about the marriage proposal, I realized I still didn't know who I was supposed to marry. All I knew from Grandpa was that he was the young CEO of a rapidly growing construction company.

I spent the whole night tossing and turning in bed, thinking about the marriage and the company merger.

By 4 a.m., after a night of deep contemplation, I was finally ready with my decision.

Chapter 6

Sarah P.O.V

It was nearly 11 in the morning, and I was ready with my decision. I went downstairs and knocked on Grandpa's door; he opened it.

I walked into the room and saw Grandma sitting on the couch, reading a magazine. I sat next to her while Grandpa sat across from us. I cleared my throat before speaking.

""Grandpa, Grandma, I've made my decision. I want to save my mother's company; I don't want to lose Amario Enterprises. I'm ready for the marriage,"" I told them.

As soon as I finished speaking, I saw both my grandparents beaming with happiness. Grandma immediately hugged me tightly.

""Oh Sarah, I knew you would make the right decision. I'm sure this marriage and merger will bring much happiness to your life,"" Grandpa said while kissing my forehead.

""I'm sure you'll fulfil the responsibilities of both a wife and the new CEO of Amario Enterprises,"" Grandma said, clasping her hands together.

Both Grandma and Grandpa started discussing the merger and wedding. It had been ages since I'd seen them this happy. When Mom was alive, we always spent our vacations with Grandpa and Grandma.

We used to have so much fun then; Mom and Grandma would bake cakes and muffins together, while Dad and Grandpa taught me horseback riding and swimming.

Those were some of my happiest memories with my family.

Thinking of my father made me realize it had been five years since I'd seen him.

During those years, he never contacted me, and I didn't make any effort either. Before moving back here, I hoped he might visit, but it's been nearly a month since I returned, and he hasn't shown up.

""Sarah, dear, you'll be coming with me to Amario Enterprises tomorrow to sign the documents. You'll also meet your fiancé before signing,"" Grandpa informed me.

""Yes, dear, it would be good if you two met and got to know each other before the wedding,"" Grandma added.

I gave them a weak smile, but deep inside, I was nervous about the whole situation. Suddenly, it occurred to me that I still didn't know the name of the person I was marrying.

""Grandpa, may I know the name of the person I'm marrying?"" I asked.

""Oh! Well, his name is Adrian Parker, the CEO of Parker Enterprises,"" he replied.

As soon as he said the name, I felt the ground slip from under my feet.

""Adrian Parker? The son of James and Lauren Parker?"" I asked, hoping it wasn't him.

""Yes, sweetheart, he's the one,"" he answered.

I was utterly shocked. He was the same Adrian Parker who used to be my friend—a friend who abandoned me and our friendship.

""I'll see you later; I have some work to do,"" I told them and kissed their cheeks.

I immediately grabbed my car keys and started driving without a specific destination. After an hour, I found myself standing in front of my mother's grave.

I sat there for hours, remembering how happy our lives were when she was alive. Maybe I wouldn't be in this situation if she were here. Maybe I would have had a normal life with a happy family.

But now, everything is different; nothing is as I imagined or wished.

I still remember Adrian Parker, the guy who used to be one of my close friends along with Jessica, but it's been years since we talked or saw each other.

When he left for London, we three promised to stay connected no matter what. Even when Jessica started ignoring me, Adrian and I stayed in touch through emails, social media, and calls.

But slowly, the calls became less frequent, and eventually, he stopped calling altogether. I tried reaching out, but my calls went to voicemail. We were still connected through messages and emails, but by the end of sophomore year, he stopped replying.

Occasionally, I overheard Jessica and Chloe talking about Adrian. I heard them discuss the plans Adrian and Jessica made for her visit to London that summer.

It became clear he was purposely avoiding me. Maybe he chose Jessica over me, though all I wanted was for us three to stay friends. But they both decided to throw me out of their lives as if our friendship meant nothing to them.

FLASHBACK

It had been almost two years since I last heard from Adrian. He visited New York every summer, and he came for vacation that year too. I saw him hanging out with Chloe and Jessica the other day.

I was in my room, finishing up a painting, when I heard noises from downstairs, indicating Chloe had brought her friends over again.

I decided to ignore them and continue my work. After finishing my painting, I heard my stomach growl. I quickly put on my hoodie and went to the kitchen to grab something to eat. As I headed back to my room, holding a mug of hot coffee, I heard Chloe call from the living room.

""Hey Sarah, what are you doing alone? Come join us,"" she said.

""No, thanks, I've got some work to do,"" I politely declined. I was about to leave when I suddenly heard Adrian's voice.

""C'mon, Sarah, join us. A few minutes won't hurt,"" he insisted.

Though my instincts told me not to, I decided to join them for a few minutes. I walked into the living room, holding my coffee mug. I saw familiar faces from school, including Jessica and Justin.

I smiled and looked at Adrian. It had been so long since I'd seen him up close. As I walked toward the couch, Chloe stuck out her leg, causing me to lose my balance. I fell flat on the floor, spilling my coffee all over Jessica. Before I could even stand, Chloe started shouting.

1. Kylie- sprinkle cookie. It’s chilled, sweet, light, and sugary. It’s better than the original punk sugar if you ask me. The sprinkles add a good flavor but the texture is soft. 10/10

2. Kendall- cookie dough it’s really really good, the cookie has a crunchie exterior but the frosting makes it soft and perfectly balanced. It also has like coffee notes? But it could just be my taste buds. 9/10

3. Kris- Yellow cake with chocolate frosting. DELICIOUS. Reminds me of the cakes my mom used to make me and my dad when I was child for birthdays. No notes. 9/10

4. Kim- Cinnamon cookie Really
Good, tastes like a churro and snicker doodle had a baby. Just wish it had more of that cinnamon flavor. 7.8/10

5. Khloe- Chocolate skillet cookie- Good cookie,  it just didn’t stand out. The mouse was light and fluffy, it might have took it to the next level if instead of the mouse it was just a frosting. If you’ve had any of the chocolate cookies you’ll know what it tastes like. 7/10 

6. Kourtney- Dog sh- I mean flourless chocolate cake. It tastes exactly like what you would think a flourless cake would taste like. It gives COCOA not chocolate. Thick, dense, and slightly gross. Needs more sweetness 2/10

Two weeks ago she literally asked me out ""for a coffee"" and when she got a negative reaction she turn that into a joke but I could tell she was all serious about that. We started imagining scenarios if she wanted to date me. I told her I'm in a relationship but she said that she could always be my secret partner or if it wouldn't work for me she'd just wait.I let her know that I'm very serious about my girlfriend and even thinking about marriage but she keeps bringing it up.

**Getting Around:** Will likely rent a car for the week ( I know it's expensive. Any other suggestions, feel free to share.)  
**Likes:** Beach, Lakes, Small Towns, History, Breweries, Being able to walk, bike riding, good food (but not really fine dining), experiences, exploring, relaxation (massage), coffee shops, breakfast/brunch  
**Dislikes:** Spending a ton of time in the car, spending all the money on a place to sleep and feeling restricted when spending money on food, experiences, etc.  
  
With that being said, we're not looking to road trip up the coast and realize that we're a bit late in the game. We do not want to fly into Boston and are fairly set on ME and/or VT.  
  
**Initial Plan:**  
Fly from BWI into MHT (1.5hr flight) and drive up to Ogunquit. Spend 3 nights in an airbnb there.  
  
Drive to Vermont (4.5-5hrs) to Burlington or Stowe for 3 nights (not sure where to stay, but would be really nice to be on the water or at a place that's walkable to town.  
  
Drive back to Manchester, stay overnight and fly out the next day.  
  
**But**...we're wondering if the 4-5hr drive is worth the time it will take to get between ME and VT.  
  
Should we just stay in VT the whole time? Maybe find two different places to stay during the week there?  
  
Would we be missing out if we passed on ME? I know it's going to be very crowed during this time.

During med breaks, I’ll have an Alani Nu because thats a sugar free energy drink that doesn’t make me crash and is very tasty. 

However, if I have an Alani while medicated, I DO crash after two hours. I feel so fatigued and gross. I tried other sugar-free energy drinks and experienced the same! No anxiety, just slow and tried as hell. Coffee while medicated doesn’t do this, though. Coffee seems to compliment it.

**Effectiveness** \- it won't wake u up, maybe 1/10 or negligible caffeine as compared to the Nescafe classic.

When I asked her about it she said she also recently discovered one on her and is now talking about HPV and how it’s common and nothing to worry about. 

I feel very torn. I have so much fun with her but then I have these moments where she lashes out or I can tell she is being deceitful. I’ve tried to talk to her about it and it always ends in her crying and saying “I’ll work to do better” 

She also doesn’t have a career. She works in coffee and food service and I work as an engineer. I financially support both of us. While she does do my dishes and she’ll help wash my clothes from time to time I spend around $600 a month additional supporting her.

I developed severe hypertension at age 33 after having zero blood pressure issues previously. I was an otherwise perfectly healthy person. The hypertension came with cramps, itching, fatigue, constant feelings of anxiety, and heart palpitations. 

My doctors told me that, as a woman and a mother, I was just tired. Or stressed. To do more yoga. To turn off the news. To drink less coffee (I have one cup in the mornings). Every time I went to the doctor, even to follow up on emergency room visits after I had hypertensive crises, they shrugged me off.

I have worked the equivalent of a part time job for six years trying to find someone who will take me seriously. I’ve referred myself to doctors. I’ve read scholarly articles. And finally, today, I received a confirmed diagnosis: primary hyperaldosteronism.

It’s not in my head and it can be treated. If I had just accepted what my cardiologist told me, which was that resistant hypertension is probably just hereditary and that I have to live with it, I’d have developed organ failure or eventually had a stroke.

I currently have a partial plate but I haven’t been able to wear it because it keeps making me gag/vomit. It’s horrendous. The dentist made it as small as she could without compromising stability but it just wasn’t enough to stop the gagging. I have a huge fear of vomiting so it’s been awful. I’ve had 3 separate dentures made now and none of them have been wearable. The issue is that I need the rest of my teeth removed (I currently have 11) so I’ll need full plates. How do I overcome the vomiting and the gagging? Is there anything to make this easier? I’m only 36 and I feel trapped in my own body. My life has been on hold for the last 6 years. I haven’t even been able to go for coffee or dinner with friends, I’ve become so self conscious and isolated & it’s ruined my mental health.

I just wanted to share a few thoughts—I'm not a doctor or psychologist, just someone who genuinely cares about mental well-being and loves learning (and sharing!) what has helped me and others over time.

When it comes to managing stress and feeling a bit more grounded day by day, I’ve learned that it’s the *small, consistent* things that really make a difference.

Personally, I find a lot of calm through art. Painting especially helps me slow down and breathe—it’s like a little reset button for my brain. Simple things like taking a few quiet minutes in the morning, just to breathe or sit still, also really shift my mood.

Movement helps too. Even a short walk can release so much built-up tension. Sleep? Game changer. I try to treat it like something sacred (even if I don’t always succeed 😅).

Eating well isn’t always easy, especially when life gets hectic—but I definitely notice that I handle stress better when I’m not just running on sugar and coffee. And connection... it’s everything. A message to a friend or a quick chat with someone who gets me—it always brings me back to myself.

Some days, all I can manage is one kind thing for myself. Listening to a favorite song. Turning off notifications. Letting myself rest without guilt. That’s self-care too.

We’re all different, and there’s no one-size-fits-all, but I truly believe that managing stress isn’t about doing it all perfectly. It’s about finding what soothes you—and doing a bit more of that, one day at a time.

First, most of the ones I see are in business parks or have this boring/sterile corporate vibe where people only talk about business and otherwise aren't very social. I'm looking more for places where people talk to each other and hang out, hold events other than ""networking"", etc.

Second, they tend to be super expensive, like minimum 5000 CZK/month and don't even come with coffee. That's more than what I was paying in Berlin!

So, are there any good, affordable, social coworking spaces where people actually converse with each other and is easily accessible from Prague 7?

Locus Workspace is the closest to meet these requirements, but it's a pain in the ass to get to from where I live (it's also pretty expensive).

Re: Ms Anne Hall, DOB: 19 September 1972

Dear Dr Roberts,

I am referring Ms Hall, who is experiencing dysphagia to solids, for further investigation and definitive diagnosis

Ms Hall presented today reporting of difficulty swallowing solids, that started two weeks ago following a post viral upper respiratory tract infection. For management of her infection, she self medicated using over-the-counter Chinese herbal medicines of unknown contents. She has lost around 2kg weight and is experiencing epigastric pain  that radiates to the back at the level of T12. 

Ms Hall takes aspirin occasionally, two to three times monthly, and has increased her coffee consumption. She is a social drinker, primarily consuming spirits.

Based on her symptoms, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease with a possible stricture is suspected. I prescribed her Pantoprazole 40 mg for daily intake and advised her to alleviate both coffee and alcohol consumption

I would appreciate your opinion and endoscopy if required

If you require any information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,

5'9"" 65kgs, lean/fit,athletic, into working out, running, badminton, beaches, used to do taekwondo long black hairs, ear piercing (for vibe) olive beige tan skin tone

Tech nerd at heart — obsessed with AI, VR, XR, currently building my first app prolly be my majors in uni

Chill, love deep convos but also dumb jokes & banter, funny sarcastic, love hanging out, hiking, going out.

Big on emotional maturity, observing people, small circle energy

Bit of a nerd academically (95-99% type), but not a full library gremlin haha

Starting off again with my zz plants, let’s take a look at my raven zz plant. My raven zz plant is still pushing out new growth very well and they all look like they’re going strong. Some of the new growths are starting to change colour as their leaves are forming and open. It’s really cool to see the way the colours change as the leaves grow, they are going from this reddish brown to a bright green and once they are more established and begin to mature they’ll turn back into the dark purple colour. 

[Raven zz plant ](https://preview.redd.it/c7whwbr4zfte1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=207b22ed109590233b59ed399b96c7271a002286)

Next let’s take a look at my lucky zz plant, this one is also pushing out new growth as well and it also has one new shoot that is already growing leaves too. I think this plant has maybe 5 new shoots growing right now, I’m excited to see what the new leaves will look like as they come in. I also moved this one to my west facing window since it doesn’t need as much humidity as my other plants and the lighting needs can still be met from that window.

As for my regular zz plant I just watered it after a month and it still seems to be doing fine, but I don’t see any new growth happening. I moved it up from my coffee table onto my window sill so that it gets some more direct sunlight since I wasn’t sure if it was getting enough light on my coffee table. I thought it was since my coffee table is right next to my window but it’s just lower than the window and I have a sheer curtain panel but it’s really sheer and I still get sunlight there but I guess it’s not enough for the zz plant? 



Now moving onto my beautiful bird of paradise! My bird of paradise has finally finished unfurling her new leaf and it looks beautiful!! The new leaf is so big and so green, it looks amazing. It’s not fully unfurling yet as it is still growing taller but the leaf is definitely open. I’m so excited to see how tall this new leaf will be and to see when the next new leaf will grow now.

Next up, let’s take a look at my lovely monstera deliciosa. She is doing great, she is thriving and pushing out new leaves wonderfully. I have the last 2 leaves that unfurled in the last few updates and now I have another new leaf that is in the process of unfurling, and I think it might be the biggest leaf that I will have grown since. Upon closer look at my plant I also saw that there is another new leaf slowly pushing through too! I also took a look at the roots at the bottom and they are growing nicely, the roots are growing through the bottom on the holes and I can see them circling on the bottom too. 

[Monstera Deliciosa New Leaf](https://preview.redd.it/r5lw1x1fzfte1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4f676714c6e9a01a1605ab42644dcc5809cb83c)

Moving along to my peace lily! My peace lily has honestly been a really easy plant to care for after the initial hump of getting it in the first place. It was drooping for days and wilting and I thought I was going to kill it immediately after bringing it home but not only is she surviving but she is thriving. I have grown 2 or 3 new leaves on it already, I don’t have any blooms but I’m hoping that I will get some at some point with the proper care. It’s also a great plant for someone who loves to potter around and water her plants so it’s been satisfying that urge for me. 



Now let’s talk about my tradescantias! These have been growing so well and so nicely, I have been chopping and propping so many stems from all of my tradescantias; my nanouk, bubblegum and flirty tradescantias. The stems that I took from my flirty tradescantia have rooted very well in water and were ready to transfer to soil. I also took 6 more cuttings from my first tradescantia plant that I made from cuttings, this plant has taken to soil very well, I can see all the roots developing and I could begin to see new branches forming from more than one stem too. So I took the 7 cuttings I had in water and added 3 more that I just cut and turned those into another flirty tradescantia plant so I now have 3 of them. The mother plant I originally took the cuttings from is still going strong, I can see all the new branches and they’re growing nicely, I will probably need to repot that one soon but I’m going to give it time to bush out a little more first.

My tradescantia nanouk is also doing great, the two plants that I have are branching out great, I’ve getting new growth and the new leaves are so pink and so pretty. I think I might need to repot those plants soon too because I can also see where the new branches and growth is coming through on the sides too. I also have cuttings from both the nanouk and bubblegum in water that are rooting, I want to use those stems to try and make my bubblegum plant look more full.

Now for some updates on a few of my new plants! First up, my lovely monstera thai constellation. She has been acclimating very well to my apartment since I’ve gotten it. It’s been a little over a week since I’ve gotten it, I repotted and watered it thoroughly afterwards and just left it sitting aside with the money tree. I’ve been checking it for pests and also to see how it was adjusting and so far it seemed to be just fine. Last night when I was checking on it I finally saw that it’s pushing out a new leaf so I cannot wait to see what this new leaf will look like! 

As for my other new plants, nothing else has happened, they aren’t growing any new leaves or branches but they also aren’t dying so I think they’re just fine. I hope to see some new growth coming in on my philodendron pink princess and white wizard soon! I’ve been careful not to overwater them as I know they can be prone to root rot too so fingers crossed with some more time and light I’ll see new leaves growing soon.

This is it for this week’s plant update, all the new growth coming in on my new plants is amazing and I can’t wait to see the continued progress as the spring season comes.

Things have been going really well. Yesterday, i was at his house and noticed a water bottle with a girls name on it on his coffee table. He said it was an old water bottle. Some back story: we stayed up until 5 am friday night to saturday and at like 3 am decided to hangout saturday night too. 

We woke up at like 10 am, i left shortly after. And at like 2 pm he said he forgot he said he’d hangout with his good friend that went through a break up. 

Fast forward to yesterday when the incident happened. He brought flowers to my place because he was in my neighborhood. We had a nice lunch and i went to work. When i got to his place after, we were watching a show and i noticed the water bottle with a starbucks label that had a girls name on it on his coffee table. Thats when he told me it was an old one, quickly grabbed it, and threw it out, and went on with the night.

This morning he could tell something was off with me and asked what was up. I told him the water bottle thing put me off. He said he understood where I was coming from and that he understood how it looked but explained he sometimes saves water bottles cause his gym doesn’t have a water fountain and he refused to purchase water there out of principle. He then went to his fridge and pulled out two obviously well used disposable water bottles, one of which was completely empty. He threw that one out too.

it’s maybe worth mentioning that he isn’t the tidiest guy and has a bunch of random stuff laying around. His home office clearly has a bunch of clutter in it too.

Today after we parted ways he reiterated that he was sorry about the whole water bottle thing and offered to send me a picture of it later tonight if i wanted.

I’m unsure how to proceed with this and feel put off by the whole thing.",1,1744044609.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

Before i get into the HT and procedure, I must say Este has been second to none so far. Pickup service is on point and have put me up in probably the best hotel in Istanbul the Hilton Bomonti. Lovely area with shops, coffee shops and restraunts . When I arrived today there was someone there to greet me went into the clinic and it was a lovely clinic very clean and really nice feel to it. The staff was friendly I overpaid and they told me and give me money back so definitely no conning going on here. Was brought into get bloods done then I got a consultation with the doctor and he was so good advised me when I’m talking to plastic surgeon be careful about choosing hair line and make sure you happy and not to say yes for the sake of it basically and was funny guy really liked him . Then I was taking up stairs I first got SVF stem-cell treatment which was great was a sleep for 3 mins and then back awake again and then a little procedure on top of that took 25 mins. Then onto the HT itself. A team accompanied by a plastic surgeon and a doctor. Team was brillant we sat full 6 hours 4000 graphs. Did not stop once. Was pain free, at start I did feel a small bit and just numbed me. I slept throughout the procedure snoring etc as I had local antistatic which was very good I must say. After HT got the bone fluid that was taking during stemcell treatment and injected  into head plus prp got a few pictures taking the team explained everything to me and then kitted me out with a carrier bag full of hair goodies serum shampoos minoxidil finasteride if I want to take and tons of other stuff. I am really pleased with it and will upload pictures. I had done my research lads and trust me when your doing something like this do research make sure your happy and confident and go with your gut feeling. Don’t pay for a cheap package get the best one as I think clinic’s with treat you better, with the best team etc. plus Este only do 3 -5 transplants a day which is good. I think if you are looking to go to turkey Este should be there on your list of options. ",1,1744044387.0,HairTransplanTR,0,1.0,False

Michigan Ross or INSEAD

Honestly, zero scholarship in both, which… ouch! But hey, here we are, and it's decision time. 😂

Little background about me: I’m European, deep into the tech startup world (which means endless coffee and more Slack notifications than any human should endure). When I kicked off my MBA journey, my eyes were set on the American dream—new experiences, fresh connections, and diving headfirst into that buzzing U.S. scene. But now that reality hit and I got admits from both Ross and INSEAD, things aren't as clear as I imagined.

INSEAD’s got that tempting 1-year fast track—kinda like ripping off a Band-Aid: quick and less painful on the wallet. Plus, since I already speak French, I’d probably slide right into life in Paris smoother than butter on a warm croissant (sorry, couldn't resist). 🍞🥐
On the flip side, Ross means two years—double the investment, yeah—but also a chance to dive deeper, network longer, and snag a summer internship. That internship might be my golden ticket into the U.S. tech ecosystem. Problem is, Ann Arbor feels like a complete black box right now. Sure, people say it’s great, vibrant, yada yada... but is it really my scene? No clue. 🤷‍♂️

I’d love to get your thoughts here, especially if you've been in a similar spot or know people who've lived the Ross or INSEAD life. Which school do you think offers better connections and experiences for someone passionate about tech startups? Does that extra year in Ann Arbor truly make a difference career-wise, or would INSEAD’s speedier timeline be smarter?

Help a guy out, please—I’m all ears (and mildly panicking). 😅 Thanks a ton!

1jtpt6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TallTalesTwisted/comments/1jtpt6a/the_snow_globe_went_still/,The Snow Globe Went Still,"I used to think healing would feel like light through a window. Warm. Gentle. Easy to sit in.

And for a while, it did. I had everything I ever wanted.

A little house painted sage green with sun-catching windows and vines curling up the porch railing. Art supplies in every corner. Books stacked in lazy towers. A life that felt like mine.

My partner would sing to himself in the kitchen, usually off-key, but it made the mornings feel sacred. I wrote poems on sticky notes and left them in his coat pockets. He’d come home holding them like treasure, smiling like I gave him a whole galaxy.

I painted again. Big messy canvases full of soft color and loud feeling. I journaled like my soul depended on it. And in the middle of our little living room, on the coffee table, sat the snow globe.

It was the only thing I didn’t thrift or make myself.

Nana gave it to me when I was five. A little brown girl in a yellow coat stood frozen beneath the glass, arms out like she was dancing in the snow. When you twisted the base, it played a soft lullaby—one Nana used to hum while combing through my hair.

It followed me through every move, every heartbreak, every bad year. Always centered. Always safe.

Until the morning it changed.

The snow stopped falling. I shook it gently. Tapped the glass. Stillness.

Then I noticed the girl inside—the one I’d stared at for most of my life—was facing the wrong way. Her back was to me.

I blinked. “Babe,” I called out, holding it up, “did you move this?”

He leaned out the bedroom doorway, toothbrush in hand. “Move what?”

“The snow globe. The girl’s turned around.”

He squinted at it from across the room. “She’s always been like that.”

No… she hadn’t.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept glancing at the coffee table, waiting for her to turn back. The lullaby didn’t play when I twisted the base. Just a dull click.

The next day, the snow was black.

Tiny flecks like soot drifted over the little town in the globe. The sky above the girl looked bruised. But when I called my partner to look, he frowned at me like I was asking him to see ghosts.

“It looks fine,” he said. “Maybe you need to rest.”

So I rested. I slept for what felt like a hundred years. Woke up in a cold bed.

The house was quiet. Too quiet.

No humming from the kitchen. No poems tucked in pockets. The toothbrush holder only had one brush.

I called out for him.

No answer.

I searched the house like I’d misplaced something—but the more I looked, the less real it all felt. The books were blank. The paintings were gray. My laptop wouldn’t turn on. My name wasn’t in any of the journals.

I sat on the couch and stared at the snow globe.

The girl had no face.

I must’ve cried for hours. Not because I was scared, but because deep down, I knew none of it was real. My partner. The house. The peace.

All of it was a painting I made in my mind, one brushstroke at a time, until I believed it was home.

But it wasn’t.

I had never moved into this house. I never kissed anyone in that kitchen. I hadn’t written a poem in months. I had barely eaten. I had barely survived.

I was still in my old apartment—curtains drawn, dishes in the sink, canvases untouched, phone on silent. I’d built a dream life in my head to survive the weight of not having one in real life.

And the snow globe?

It was real. The only thing that ever was.

It sat on my nightstand, not the coffee table. Still dusty from the last time I touched it. The girl inside never turned her back. She never moved at all.

I did.

I held the snow globe like it could give me back what never existed. But it only stared back, still and silent.

1jtpseu,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1jtpseu/straws_avoiding_camel/,Straws avoiding Camel,"   The sun, a persistent witness, illuminates my struggle to retrieve words carried on the wind, unsent messages lingering in the air. The final push-ups, silent adversaries, test my resolve, while the aroma of brewing coffee, a foreign warmth, tugs at my lips, a one-sided smile reaching for the expanse above. Gratitude, a distant horizon on some days, remains closer than perceived, as I pause, observing the parched earth. My mind, a fractured vessel, labors to mend, yet must also contemplate the future fragility to fortify the repair. The familiar orbit of overthinking returns to the starkness of reality, where all existence is between 1 and 0. Dancing in the darkness, I was met with indifference when cornered, until, refracted, my full spectrum became visible. Ignored, I descended into ignorance, most cave dwellers mistook rainbows for shades of ash. One embraced the light, while others remained blinded. The ascending sun, my guiding star, compels me to document the luminescence discovered in the darkness, repeat. Job, the task, an endless thread, offers the choice to blend into the tapestry, the swatch, eternally. The fear surrounding this thought diminishes, revealed as a mere illusion of time, yet within the mind's cavern, a faint glimmer unveils a black hole, a silent void, still requiring one.

So, I’m driving home from a work road trip, and will pass through WDW on the way there.

When dieting before, I’ve been able to stick to it while visiting WDW, but everybody’s experience is different, and menus change all of the time. 

I’ve been intermittent fasting, only having two meals a day between 1 P.M. and 8 P.M., drinking only black coffee, or black tea in the morning. No sugar (except for natural sugars in raspberries and blackberries), or carbs. No cheat days, either!

Over the years I’ve enjoyed some incredible, healthy meals at WDW, but I wanted to know what experiences you all recommend as far as dining is concerned, but only healthy ones if possible. 

I’ve already got Shiki-Sai booked for Wednesday afternoon, and am very much looking forward to the sashimi they offer (no rice or sauces! Gotta stick to it!).

1jtpnby,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1jtpnby/slime_in_friends_hair_may_have_lasting_results_on/,Slime in friends hair may have lasting results on friendship,"I have two girls, the youngest (8), had a play date yesterday with one of her good friends, who's mom has also become good friends with the wife. 

She came over, moms were hanging out drinking coffee in the living room, kids upstairs playing in the loft(playarea). Then all of a sudden the friend is calling for her mom. She's got slime all over her hair. 

She's in tears and they leave abruptly. Wife texts her a little later asking how it is and we don't get a response until after the kids are in bed. 

We didn't know the extent of the damage and just thought it was an accident of play that it got caught on her hair. When we confronted daughter about it yesterday she said she didn't want to talk about it. We figured she might be embarrassed about it. 

Needless to say, the conversation with the other mom is painting a different picture. The friends little sister was there too and it seems both of them are saying that our kid did it and it wasn't an accident. Her friend feels attacked by our daughter and that it was done on purpose. This will likely have a lasting effect on their relationship and the moms too. Which is unfortunate because my wife had very few friends these days. 

I talked with daughter this morning about it. After a lot of prying, I found out she was using the slime(almost puddy like) and had rolled it into a ball and tried throwing it on the wall, which she then said missed and hit the friend. They tried washing it out in the sink and thats when they called the mom. 

As much as I want to be on my kids side, I feel that she isn't giving me a truthful answer and believe there is more to what happened but she's not sharing. Her friend just had a hair style appointment yesterday. Last week my kid tried cutting her own hair... Butchered the front, but luckily my talented wife was able to fix it and she's got bangs now. 

I never look at things from one side. I always try to get the picture of both sides and weigh the outcome from there. Could she have done it out of jealousy, malcontent? I will always have my kids back, but I'm not sure how I should proceed if it was. 

She doesn't want to apologize either. We suggested writing a letter, but she said no. 

Both wife and I had fucked up childhoods so we've raised our kids in the opposite of our parents. They're good kids. Typically the more shy kids in class rooms and smaller close group of friends. 

Just feel at a loss. I think there needs to be a punishment or something if she can't be truthful, and accepting of what happened. Locking her out in the MS family app for a week might be on the cards.

Over the past year, I’ve been building EduVibz (www.eduvibz.com) in my spare time—nights, weekends, and coffee-fueled early mornings. It’s a passion project that grew into something bigger than I expected, and I’ve just launched the beta.

What it is:
EduVibz is an educational music streaming platform. If thats a mouthful, we turn academic content (starting with the South African school curriculum) into catchy, curriculum-aligned songs to help students remember and understand material more easily. Think of it as a cross between Spotify and a study guide.

Why I built it:
I’ve always believed music is one of the most powerful memory tools, but nobody had quite nailed it for real school content—aligned with official syllabi, scalable, and up-to-date. I figured I’d give it a shot.

What’s live so far:

3 subjects from the Grade 12 CAPS curriculum

Smooth streaming experience with background play

Playlists by topic, subject, and grade

A contact form for users to report bugs or suggest improvements

A lot more music already produced, just not uploaded yet


What I’m looking for:

Honest feedback on the concept, UX, or anything else

Ideas on how to improve the experience or roll out new features

Any thoughts from people who've done EdTech or music-related projects

Even brutal feedback—especially if something feels off, gimmicky, or confusing


I know I probably didn’t launch lean enough. I’ve made a ton of mistakes, spent a long time getting a provisional patent, and I’m still figuring things out as I go. But it’s live now, and I’d love your thoughts!

He was fond of coffee and many other treats, and despite the initial farcical nature of the story, there are indeed accounts of Wojtek carrying crates of artillery shells and copying the behaviour of his fellow soldiers. After demobilization following World War II, Wojtek resided in Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland, where members of his former regiment would often visit to say hello.

A fox was chosen early on for the emblem, as SPA 84 had a pair of foxes as squadron mascots at the time. Foxes in general commonly represent cunning and hunting prowess, making them a popular animal to depict in military emblems. The original emblem was slightly more refined, with the fox wearing a monocle over its right eye, and it would go through several further variations. Despite SPA 84 being deactivated in 1919, the traditions and emblem have been preserved in more modern fighter squadrons as a tribute, and could be found on the middle of the tail of several jet aircraft, including the Super Mystère B2, Mirage IIIC, Mirage F1, and the Mirage 2000C.""

1jtphtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1jtphtg/i_feel_defeated/,I feel defeated,"I (20M) was diagnosed with Gerd a little over a year ago. My main symptom is burping; I burp probably 100+ times a day, after I eat or drink anything, even water. And these aren't little burps, most of them are seconds long, painful burps. It's all gotten a lot worse over this past year, despite trying pantaprazole, famatodine, simethicone, and almost every kind of PPI. I am very active and go to the gym almost every day, and over the past few months I've noticed that the stomach pain is almost unbearable whenever I exercise. I feel like I'm going to vomit after just 20 minutes of even low intensity workouts, and it's taken the joy out one of my few hobbies that really helps my mental health. I've tried cutting out the ""triggers"" like coffee and alcohol, but while it gets slightly better it's nothing close to normal. I don't see it getting better anytime soon, and I can already feel my mental health deteriorating even more now that I cant even enjoy working out. Does anyone have any tips/solutions?

**Why This Pick?**

Not only are the 76ers without their top scorers tonight, but the Heat have covered the spread in 9 of their last 10 outings. Yes, Miami has a healthy number of players on their ‘Questionable’ list, but I just don’t see this encounter being a competitive one – especially if Bam Adebayo & Tyler Herro both play. Philadelphia is wildly outgunned here, and the Heat have won their last 3 encounters with the Sixers. Tonight, I say they make it 4. Take Miami to cover at home.

1jtpf3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Water_Fasting/comments/1jtpf3q/underrated_refeeding_populating_the_colon_with/,[ ! underrated ] Refeeding - Populating the colon with good bacteria,"Hi,

I've completed about 10 water fasts, ranging from 7 to 21 days each.

What I've never taken seriously so far is refeeding. Honestly, I took it less seriously with each fast, mainly because I diligently took my electrolytes *during* the fast and never experienced complications, even when I jumped straight back into healthy keto food afterwards. In the back of my mind, I always *thought* about eating relatively healthy stuff – limiting carbs and sweets initially – hoping to improve my microbiome, as I imagined my colon was pretty 'starved out' after a fast. During recent research (using Perplexity), I discovered there's substantial research on fasting *and* refeeding. From what I've read, to effectively promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, I realized I need to approach refeeding *way* more systematically, specifically choosing properly fermented (and unpasteurized!) foods.

In my experience, this sub (and others like it) often lack proper references and education on this topic.
If I had seen a good refeeding protocol outlining specific foods and the rationale behind them, I probably would have benefited way more from my previous fasts.

I want to share some of the things I've found, so they can be discussed and hopefully improve our collective 'gains'.

## Why Structured Refeeding is Crucial (Especially After Longer Fasts > 5 days)

Ignoring a structured refeed isn't just about missing out on potential gains; it can cause significant, sometimes dangerous, issues. Haphazardly jumping back into eating after your gut has been resting can lead to:

**1. Metabolic Shock & Refeeding Syndrome Risks:**

*   **Insulin Surge:** A potentially massive [4.8-fold increase in serum insulin](https://www.theultimatehuman.com/post/the-comprehensive-guide-to-water-fasting-benefits-and-how-it-works) can happen within just 1 hour of significant carbohydrate intake. This can overwhelm pancreatic β-cells that have adapted to low insulin output during the fast ([Source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2440847/), [Source](https://www.theultimatehuman.com/post/the-comprehensive-guide-to-water-fasting-benefits-and-how-it-works)).
*   **Electrolyte Crashes:** Abrupt refeeding, especially with carbs, forces electrolytes (like phosphate, potassium, magnesium) into cells rapidly. This can cause potentially dangerous drops in blood levels. **Hypophosphatemia** (<0.65 mmol/L) is particularly common, seen in up to [83% of poorly managed cases](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2440847/), significantly increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and neurological issues ([Source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2440847/), [Source](https://wacountry.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/WACHS/Documents/About-us/Policies/Adult-Refeeding-Syndrome-Clinical-Guideline.pdf?thn=0)). **Refeeding syndrome** itself carries a sobering [19% mortality rate in unmonitored, severe cases](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2440847/) ([Source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2440847/), [Source](https://wacountry.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/WACHS/Documents/About-us/Policies/Adult-Refeeding-Syndrome-Clinical-Guideline.pdf?thn=0)). *This is the single most important reason to refeed slowly and carefully after any fast longer than 5-7 days.*
*   **Fluid Retention:** The kidneys aggressively retain sodium upon refeeding, leading to sometimes dramatic fluid shifts and edema. An average [5.2 kg (over 11 lbs) weight gain purely from edema within 72 hours](https://www.theultimatehuman.com/post/the-comprehensive-guide-to-water-fasting-benefits-and-how-it-works) has been noted in some contexts ([Source](https://www.dietdoctor.com/fasting-and-re-feeding-syndrome), [Source](https://www.theultimatehuman.com/post/the-comprehensive-guide-to-water-fasting-benefits-and-how-it-works)). While mostly temporary, this can be uncomfortable and strain the cardiovascular system.
*   **Gastrointestinal Distress:** The gut lining thins, and digestive enzyme production decreases during a fast. Introducing heavy foods, especially fats and complex meals too early, commonly leads to diarrhea (reported [92% incidence with premature fat intake](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1gthb6q/refeeding_process_after_42_day_water_fast/) in one case study context), bloating, cramping, and general discomfort ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1gthb6q/refeeding_process_after_42_day_water_fast/), [Source](https://www.dietdoctor.com/fasting-and-re-feeding-syndrome)).

**2. Microbiome Disruption & Lost Opportunity:**

*   **Dysbiosis Risk:** Fasting significantly alters the gut microbiome, often leading to a decrease in overall bacterial load and diversity, and a shift in relative abundance – notably an increase in *Bacteroidetes* and a decrease in *Firmicutes* and potentially opportunistic *Proteobacteria* ([Source](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.922727/full), [Source](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpgi.00475.2020)). While potentially beneficial initially (clearing out overgrowths), refeeding improperly (e.g., high sugar/processed foods) can allow undesirable bacteria (*Proteobacteria* like *E. coli*) to bloom rapidly, potentially leading to dysbiosis. One case study noted a [79% increase in *E. coli* with haphazard refeeding vs. controlled](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.00050/full) ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1gthb6q/refeeding_process_after_42_day_water_fast/), [Source](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.00050/full)).
*   **Butyrate Producer Depletion:** Beneficial bacteria that produce Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) like butyrate (crucial fuel for colon cells, anti-inflammatory) can be diminished during fasting and may struggle to recover without the right foods. Poor refeeding resulted in significantly lower fecal SCFA levels ([0.8 mM vs. 2.1 mM](https://www.theultimatehuman.com/post/the-comprehensive-guide-to-water-fasting-benefits-and-how-it-works)) compared to structured protocols ([Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36296997/), [Source](https://www.theultimatehuman.com/post/the-comprehensive-guide-to-water-fasting-benefits-and-how-it-works)).
*   **Long-Term Metabolic Consequences:** Beyond the immediate risks, poor refeeding habits might negate some long-term metabolic benefits of fasting. Studies suggest links between abrupt high-carb refeeding and increased risk of **hepatic steatosis** (fatty liver) ([Source](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.04.24302309v1.full-text), [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36296997/)) and potentially prolonged **insulin resistance** (elevated HOMA-IR scores weeks later) ([Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36296997/), [Source](https://www.theultimatehuman.com/post/the-comprehensive-guide-to-water-fasting-benefits-and-how-it-works)).

## General Refeeding Principles: Duration and Phasing

A good rule of thumb is that your dedicated refeeding period should be proportional to your fast length. Rushing this process is where problems arise.

| Fast Duration | Minimum Recommended Refeed Period | General Caloric Progression Strategy                                                                                                                             |
| :------------ | :------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7–14 days     | At least 2-4 days (approx. 25%+) | Start very low (~250-500 kcal Day 1), gradually increase towards TDEE over ~3-7 days ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1gthb6q/refeeding_process_after_42_day_water_fast/), [Source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2440847/)) |
| 15–30 days    | At least 5-10 days (approx. 33%+) | Start very low (~250 kcal Day 1), increase slowly, perhaps by ~250 kcal/day or less ([Source](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.04.24302309v1.full-text), [Source](https://www.drberg.com/blog/refeeding-after-your-prolonged-fast))               |
| 30+ days      | At least 15 days (approx. 50%+)   | Start extremely low (~100-250 kcal Day 1), increase very slowly, perhaps by ~100-200 kcal/day ([Source](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/ashwini.wagle/courses/c6/s1/Rebecca_Jackl.pdf))                                            |

*(TDEE = Total Daily Energy Expenditure. These are guidelines; always listen to your body).*

A phased approach helps your system adapt gradually:

1.  **Phase 1: Days 1-3 (Liquids & Initial Gut Seeding):** Focus on hydration, critical electrolytes, and gently re-awakening the gut with easily absorbable nutrients and initial beneficial microbes.
    *   **Hydration & Electrolytes:** Absolutely critical. Bone broth (~200mL portions) provides sodium, some minerals, and collagen/gelatin which is soothing for the gut lining ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1gthb6q/refeeding_process_after_42_day_water_fast/), [Source](https://www.drberg.com/blog/refeeding-after-your-prolonged-fast)). Diluted vegetable juices (celery, cucumber - strained) can add minerals. Electrolyte supplements (sodium, potassium, magnesium) often continued from the fast are vital.
    *   **Initial Microbial Seeding:** Introduce *Lactobacillus* & *Bifidobacterium* via *unpasteurized* fermented liquids.
        *   **Sauerkraut Brine:** Start with just the liquid (1-2 Tbsp, 2-3x/day). Contains beneficial strains like *Leuconostoc mesenteroides* ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1gthb6q/refeeding_process_after_42_day_water_fast/), [Source](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.00050/full), [Source](https://gutsyferments.com.au/blogs/posts/how-to-seed-your-gut)).
        *   **Water Kefir / Milk Kefir (if tolerated):** Small amounts (~50-100mL). Water kefir can be rich in *L. rhamnosus* ([Source](https://gutsyferments.com.au/blogs/posts/how-to-seed-your-gut)). Plain milk kefir (if dairy is okay for you) offers diverse strains.
        *   **Diluted Plain Yogurt:** A small amount whisked into water can be an option.
    *   **Minimal Fiber:** Keep fiber very low (<5g/day) initially. This prevents feeding potentially opportunistic bacteria before the beneficial ones gain a foothold ([Source](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.922727/full)).

2.  **Phase 2: Days 4-7 (Soft Foods & Feeding Butyrate Producers):** Introduce easily digestible, low-fiber soft foods and start providing fuel (prebiotics) for key beneficial bacteria.
    *   **Targeting Butyrate Producers:** Focus on restoring crucial species like *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii*. They thrive on specific fibers.
    *   **Soft, Cooked Foods:**
        *   **Egg Yolks:** Well-tolerated, nutrient-dense (choline for liver health - [Source](https://www.drberg.com/blog/refeeding-after-your-prolonged-fast), [Source](https://www.theultimatehuman.com/post/the-comprehensive-guide-to-water-fasting-benefits-and-how-it-works)). Start with 1-2 soft-boiled or poached yolks.
        *   **Steamed/Pureed Non-Starchy Veggies:** Zucchini, summer squash, cucumber (peeled/seeded), maybe asparagus tips. Offer gentle soluble fiber ([Source](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.04.24302309v1.full-text), [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36296997/)).
        *   **Avocado:** Healthy fats, potassium, soft texture. Start with a small amount (1/4 avocado).
    *   **Introducing Prebiotic Fiber:**
        *   **Resistant Starch (RS):** Start introducing small amounts (~5-10g/day initially, working up to ~15g). Cooked and cooled potatoes or rice, green banana flour (mixed in liquid), or plantains are good sources. RS specifically feeds butyrate producers ([Source](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpgi.00475.2020)).
        *   **Gentle Soluble Fiber:** Psyllium husk (start very small - 1/2 tsp in water), ground flax/chia seeds (soaked).

3.  **Phase 3: Days 8+ (Whole Foods & Diversity):** Gradually expand the variety of whole foods, focusing on nutrient density and continued microbiome support.
    *   **Increase Fiber Diversity:** Slowly add well-cooked legumes (lentils, chickpeas), whole grains (oats, quinoa - if tolerated), nuts, and seeds. Variety fuels a diverse microbiome.
    *   **Polyphenol Power:** Emphasize colorful fruits and vegetables. Berries (~150g/day), dark leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables (~200g/day, well-cooked initially) provide polyphenols that act as antioxidants and prebiotics, feeding beneficial bacteria like *Akkermansia* ([Source](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.00050/full), [Source](https://www.theultimatehuman.com/post/the-comprehensive-guide-to-water-fasting-benefits-and-how-it-works)). Cycle through different types.
    *   **Lean Proteins:** Introduce fish, poultry, or other lean proteins as tolerated.
    *   **Spermidine-Rich Foods:** Foods like aged cheese, mushrooms, legumes, and potentially wheat germ ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1gthb6q/refeeding_process_after_42_day_water_fast/), [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36296997/)) contain spermidine, which is linked to autophagy and may support gut health, potentially boosting *Akkermansia* ([Source](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.922727/full) - mentioned in chat 2 context).

## Deep Dive: Optimizing Your Gut Microbiome Post-Fast

Refeeding is arguably the **single best opportunity** you have to reshape your gut microbiome environment. Fasting acts like a 'reset', reducing the overall population and potentially clearing out some less desirable residents. How you reintroduce food determines which bacteria get the resources to thrive and repopulate.

**Key Beneficial Bacteria & Their Roles:**

*   ***Lactobacillus & Bifidobacterium:*** Often the first colonizers. They produce lactic acid, which lowers gut pH, making it less hospitable for pathogens. Found abundantly in fermented dairy (kefir, yogurt) and fermented vegetables (sauerkraut, kimchi). Aim for *live, unpasteurized* sources.
*   ***Akkermansia muciniphila:*** Lives in the gut's mucus layer and helps regulate its thickness, strengthening the gut barrier. Levels can *increase* during fasting but need proper feeding afterwards. Polyphenols (from berries, pomegranate, green tea) are known prebiotics for *Akkermansia*. Spermidine might also play a role.
*   ***Faecalibacterium prausnitzii:*** One of the most abundant and important butyrate producers in a healthy gut. Butyrate is vital fuel for colon cells and has strong anti-inflammatory effects. This bacterium is anaerobic (hates oxygen) and sensitive, relying heavily on prebiotic fibers, especially resistant starch.
*   **Other Butyrate Producers:** *Roseburia*, *Eubacterium*, *Anaerostipes* species also contribute significantly to butyrate production and benefit from diverse fiber intake.

**Strategic Seeding - Probiotics & Fermented Foods:**

*   **Prioritize LIVE Cultures:** Choose *unpasteurized*, naturally fermented foods. Look for terms like ""live cultures,"" ""raw,"" or ""naturally fermented."" Pasteurization kills beneficial bacteria.
*   **Variety is Key:** Different fermented foods contain different strains. Rotate between sauerkraut, kimchi (watch spice levels initially), water kefir, milk kefir, plain unsweetened yogurt, maybe even miso or natto later on.
*   **Introduce SLOWLY:** Start with small amounts (e.g., juice first, then 1 tsp of the solid food, increasing gradually) to avoid digestive upset (gas, bloating) as your gut adapts.

**Feeding Your New Friends - Prebiotics & Fiber Diversity:**

*   **Introduce Fibers Gradually:** After the initial liquid/soft phase (Days 1-3), slowly increase fiber intake. Too much too soon can cause discomfort.
*   **Focus on Diverse Prebiotic Sources:**
    *   **Resistant Starch (RS):** Cooked & cooled potatoes/rice, green bananas/plantains, legumes. Powerful fuel for butyrate producers ([Source](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpgi.00475.2020)).
    *   **Inulin & Fructooligosaccharides (FOS):** Onions, garlic, leeks, asparagus, chicory root, Jerusalem artichokes (introduce very slowly, can be gas-producing). Excellent food for *Bifidobacteria*.
    *   **Soluble Fiber:** Oats, psyllium husk, apples, citrus fruits, flax/chia seeds. Forms a gel, aids transit, and feeds various beneficials.
    *   **Polyphenols:** Not technically fiber, but act as prebiotics. Found in berries, grapes, dark chocolate (high cacao %), green tea, coffee, colorful vegetables ([Source](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.00050/full), [Source](https://www.theultimatehuman.com/post/the-comprehensive-guide-to-water-fasting-benefits-and-how-it-works)).

**What to Limit/Avoid During Refeeding (Especially Early On):**

*   **High Sugar / Refined Carbs:** These feed less desirable bacteria and yeast, contribute to insulin spikes, and work against your goal of establishing a healthy microbiome.
*   **Processed Foods:** Often contain additives, emulsifiers, and unhealthy fats that can harm the gut lining and microbiome diversity.
*   **Artificial Sweeteners:** Some studies suggest they can negatively impact gut bacteria composition and glucose tolerance.
*   **Excessive Alcohol:** Can irritate the gut lining and negatively impact microbial balance.

## Specific Microbiome-Supporting Compounds (Consider after initial phases)

*Always consult a healthcare professional before adding new supplements, especially post-fast. Food sources are generally preferred.*

**Important Adjuncts:**

*   **Mindful Eating:** Chew food thoroughly (signals digestion, breaks down food). Eat slowly and without distractions.
*   **Circadian Eating:** Consuming meals within a consistent daily window (e.g., 10-12 hours or less) may support metabolic health and gut rhythms ([Source](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.04.24302309v1.full-text), [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36296997/)).
*   **Listen To Your Body:** This is paramount. If something causes significant discomfort, back off and introduce it even more slowly later. Individual tolerance varies hugely.

## Insights for Extended Fasts (Beyond Day 5)

For context on longer fasts (like the 7-21 days many of us do):

*   **Days 6–10 (Metabolic Optimization):** Deep ketosis (~4–6 mM β-hydroxybutyrate), high fat burning (0.3–0.5 kg/day loss), improving insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR drops), muscle preservation signals active ([Source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11494232/), [Source](https://medauth2.mdedge.com/content/water-fasting-benefits-dont-last), [Source](https://today.uic.edu/water-fasts-can-help-you-lose-weight-but-you-might-gain-it-back-quickly/), [Source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/fasting-benefits)). Electrolyte management remains critical ([Source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/water-fasting)).
*   **Days 11–14 (Autophagy Specialization):** Cellular cleanup (autophagy/mitophagy) likely peaks. Potential for enhanced clearance of senescent cells and misfolded proteins ([Source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9882602/), [Source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11494232/), [Source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/fasting-benefits)).
*   **Days 15–20 (Systemic Renewal):** Research suggests potential for deeper immune system modulation (naive T-cell shifts), epigenetic changes, and vascular improvements ([Source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/fasting-benefits), [Source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11494232/), [Source](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323605)). Requires careful monitoring and justification. *Refeeding from these lengths needs to be proportionally longer and even more cautious.*

---

**My Main Takeaway & Goal for Discussion:** Refeeding isn't just an exit strategy; it's a **therapeutic window**, especially for our gut microbiome. By consciously choosing *what*, *when*, and *how much* we eat post-fast, using specific fermented foods, prebiotic fibers, and a slow, phased approach, we can potentially amplify and solidify the benefits gained during the fast.

I hope this more detailed foundation, particularly on the microbiome aspects, is useful. I'm really keen to hear:

*   What specific *unpasteurized fermented foods* have people had success with during refeeding? (Brands, types?)
*   What were your experiences introducing *resistant starch* or other prebiotic fibers? Any tips?
*   Has anyone tracked microbiome changes pre/post fast and during refeeding?
*   What does *your* successful refeeding protocol look like?

# Call to Action!

Let's exchange about it, peer review it and make it a valueable wiki-sidebar entry.

Hope this helps some people, who haven't taken refeeding seriously enough. :>

First night back to the house without her, I went straight to bed and slept like a rock.

Echoes Beyond Orbit

Prologue: Welcome to Eos-7

“Out here, in the black silence, jokes are worth more than gold.” — Commander Jenna Yu

Transmission Date: August 13, 2193

Location: Eos-7 Orbital Research Facility

Distance from Earth: 187,000 miles

The stars didn’t twinkle from this distance—they pulsed like slow heartbeats, distant and cold. From the panoramic viewport on Deck C of Eos-7, Earth looked like a cloudy marble suspended in a velvet sea. Above it all, the station orbited with quiet grace, a skeletal ring of steel and solar sails, its blinking beacon barely visible to passing satellites and occasional supply drones.

Eos-7 wasn’t a military station. Not officially, anyway.

It was a “cooperative research facility,” the first of its kind. The goal? Bring Earth’s fractured powers—corporate, governmental, and Martian—together under one roof and aim their collective genius toward the future of weapons technology, propulsion systems, and deep-space communications. Peace through paranoia.

And the crew?

Well, the crew was… something else.

⸻

Meet the Team

Commander Jenna Yu – EarthGov Veteran (New Chicago, Earth)

Jenna had the kind of jawline that looked like it could cut glass and the kind of dry wit that could crack titanium. She’d done three tours in the Jovian Belt Wars and walked out of the last one with a cybernetic eye, a new distaste for bureaucracy, and a habit of talking to herself when she thought no one was listening.

Her motto: “Don’t panic unless I panic. And if I panic, well… start praying.”

People respected her, even when she barked orders in her bathrobe and bunny slippers.

⸻

Dr. Wyatt Keller – Astrobiologist (Memphis Free Zone, Earth)

Wyatt was the “funny one,” or at least, that’s what he kept telling people. He once did a six-minute standup routine during a blackout, using only glowsticks and a severed maintenance drone arm as a prop.

He had a cat named Schröder back on Earth who he called every Sunday. Yes, video-called. Yes, he claimed the cat understood him.

His lab was full of slime cultures and snack wrappers, and he smelled faintly of mango-flavored protein bars.

⸻

Chief Engineer Rosario “Rosie” Delgado – Tech Genius (New Bogotá Arcology)

Rosie was a walking miracle of caffeine and spite. She could fix a broken reactor with duct tape and a half-melted spanner and still make it to movie night with time to complain about the popcorn.

Raised by hackers in the underbelly of a crumbling arcology, she’d made her way up by hacking into a government-sponsored engineering contest—and winning. Twice.

Her arms were sleeved in tattoos: equations, blueprints, and one suspicious barcode no one dared ask about.

⸻

Ensign Bo “Lunchbox” Langley – Station Cook & Former MMA Champ (Alabama Sector, Earth)

No one really knew why Langley was there. Officially, he was “station logistics.” Unofficially, he made the best gumbo in orbit and could bench press a zero-G rover.

His nickname came from an incident involving a high-gravity cafeteria brawl, a steel lunchbox, and three diplomats from the Lunar Federation. None of them pressed charges.

Langley wore a different apron every day, all with aggressively positive slogans. Today’s read: “Stirring Up Trouble (and Stew)”

⸻

Kael Thorne – Weapons Specialist (Ares Basin Colony, Mars)

And then… there was Kael.

He didn’t laugh at jokes. He didn’t smile. He rarely blinked. His eyes were too pale, his accent too clipped, and his uniform always immaculate. He’d grown up in the Martian Dust Camps—settlements of fringe survivalists, separatists, and, in recent decades, insurgents.

He wasn’t technically a terrorist, but his father had bombed a hydroponics dome on Europa, and Kael had spent time in a lunar detention facility. Still, after the Martian Accords were signed, EarthGov needed a gesture. A peace offering.

So they gave him a lab and access to some of the most dangerous tech humanity had ever developed.

Everyone called him “Red.” Not to his face.

And Kael?

He called them “soft.”

⸻

Life on Eos-7

Most days were the same. They woke up, ate protein sludge or whatever Langley managed to scrape together, and worked in their labs. The days blurred together in a haze of research logs, minor malfunctions, and increasingly bizarre inside jokes.

There was a running tally in the mess hall titled: “Things That’ll Kill Us First.”
	•	Reactor Core Failure: 3 votes
	•	Airlock Misuse: 2 votes
	•	Alien Fungus in Wyatt’s Fridge: 4 votes
	•	Rosie Snapping and Overwriting Life Support: 6 votes
	•	Kael: 7 votes

Kael never acknowledged the list.

He just worked.

In his lab, he built drone prototypes and gravitic pulse emitters, tested energy weapons that could disintegrate a ship from across the solar system, and occasionally stared out the window for long stretches of time.

When asked what he was thinking about, he simply replied:

“Escape velocity.”

⸻

The Quiet Before

What no one knew—not even Kael—was that deep in the lower levels of Eos-7, behind reinforced panels and encryption walls no one had touched in years, something was beginning to stir.

A looped message played in an abandoned communications array, repeating in binary:

“WHO WROTE THE SIGNAL
WHO WROTE THE SIGNAL
WHO WROTE THE SIGNAL”

It had been broadcasting for six months.

No one had checked that section of the station since Eos-5 went silent.

No one wanted to.

⸻

Closing Transmission Log – Day 312

COMMANDER YU: All systems stable. No anomalies. Morale is surprisingly good. Kael even joined game night. He didn’t play, but he watched. I think that counts for something.

DR. WYATT KELLER: I fed my space mold a piece of gummy worm. It grew legs. Is that bad?

ROSIE DELGADO: If the AI makes one more sarcastic comment about my dating history, I will turn it into a calculator.

BO LANGLEY: Today’s stew is made from rehydrated okra and questionable chicken. Godspeed.

KAEL THORNE: Power fluctuations in Deck D. Possible sabotage. Or entropy. Doesn’t matter. I’ll handle it.

⸻

And somewhere, in the dark corridors of Eos-7, a door hissed open.

It hadn’t been opened in over 14 years.

No one heard it.

Except the station.

⸻

[END OF PROLOGUE]


Chapter One: Things That Shouldn’t Move in Zero Gravity

Part One: The Loser Goes First

“If I vanish, don’t come looking. If I scream, especially don’t come looking.” — Kael Thorne, moments before descending below Deck F

The alarm started just after midnight, station time.

A low, keening chime that pulsed once every seven seconds. Not loud, but insistent—like a drip in a dark room. It echoed down the metal bones of Eos-7, interrupting sleep cycles and shower schedules, echoing through empty labs and humming corridors like a forgotten nursery rhyme.

Deck G—abandoned, power-deprived, officially sealed after the reactor expansion six years ago. No one went down there anymore. Not since the reshuffling. Not since Eos-5.

Still, the alarm was real. Rosie confirmed it. Low-priority, localized to a single junction. But no known cause.

Which meant a vote.

⸻

The crew gathered in the mess, everyone still half-asleep and dressed like mismatched dolls from different centuries.

Rosie had her hair in a messy bun and grease on her cheek. Keller was wrapped in his “Space Camp 2189” blanket like a monk. Langley clutched a steaming mug of something thick and aggressive-smelling. Commander Yu presided with her usual sigh of eternal patience, sipping black coffee and narrowing her cybernetic eye.

Kael stood at the end of the table, silent. Watching.

No one made eye contact.

Votes were cast. Secretly, to avoid blood feuds. Standard procedure.

Final Tally:
Langley – 0
Keller – 0 (on account of “he’d get eaten first”)
Rosie – 1 (her own vote, bitterly)
Commander Yu – 0
Kael – 4

He didn’t protest. Didn’t blink. Just stood, nodded once, and turned.

Rosie muttered under her breath: “At least he doesn’t need a flashlight—his rage glows in the dark.”

⸻

Descent

The elevator to Deck G wheezed like it hadn’t moved in a decade. It probably hadn’t. The lights inside flickered as Kael rode down in silence, cradling a modified rail pistol and a narrow-beam lantern.

When the doors opened, they exhaled dust.

Deck G wasn’t like the rest of Eos-7. There were no friendly AI chirps, no maintenance drones buzzing about. The air felt… heavier. Like the gravity was wrong, just slightly off by a fraction. The hallway stretched ahead in a tight metal throat, walls scratched and unpainted, cables dangling from ceiling panels like nervous veins.

And then he heard it.

A whisper. No language. Just sound. Almost like radio static crawling through a dying man’s lungs.

khhhhhhhh…hrrkkk…who…wrote…the…signal…

His breath fogged.

No other deck was this cold.

⸻

The Anomaly

It was near Junction 9, where the schematic said nothing existed except a welded shut maintenance shaft.

But the door wasn’t welded anymore.

It stood open.

Beyond it: a small chamber. Triangular walls. A floor made of metal plates with markings he didn’t recognize. In the center—hovering exactly one meter off the ground—was a sphere.

Black. Glossy. Perfectly still.

Kael froze.

His heart pounded, but not with fear. With recognition.

⸻

Flashback

The smell of Martian dust. That dry, electric sting of static on red soil. The low rumble of thunder from underground detonations. His father’s voice, screaming over a shortwave: “The Earthmen will never understand what they’ve stolen!”

He was sixteen again. Standing in the ruins of Habitat Theta, cradling his sister’s broken body, half-buried in collapsed rebar. Watching the EarthGov drones sweep through the wreckage like scavengers with sirens.

He remembered the heat. The hunger. The silence after.

Kael clenched his fists.

His vision blurred.

The room flickered.

⸻

The Change

He staggered forward—against his will. Like something in the air had hooked into his chest and pulled.

The sphere pulsed.

Once.

Then again.

It wasn’t glowing. It was absorbing. Light, heat, memory.

“Kael.”

The voice wasn’t his father’s.

It wasn’t human.

It was inside him.

For a moment, he couldn’t move. Then he saw his own hand rise without command, reaching toward the object. Just before contact, the lights in the chamber exploded—every bulb, every panel.

Darkness.

And then—white fire.

His mind was fracturing. Thoughts that weren’t his, images from futures that hadn’t happened. A dead Earth. A torn sky. Himself—older, taller, mouth stitched shut—screaming silently from the ruins of Eos-7.

⸻

Return

Kael woke on the floor.

The chamber was quiet again. The sphere gone.

His fingers sparked. Tiny arcs of electricity danced across his knuckles, vanishing before they could register. His breath no longer fogged the air.

He stood slowly.

And then he heard the whisper again.

But this time… it was laughing.

⸻

[TO BE CONTINUED] 

Chapter One: Things That Shouldn’t Move in Zero Gravity

Part Two: The Signal That Watches Back 

“The universe doesn’t care if we’re scared. That’s what makes it scary.”
— Rosie Tran, Systems Engineer, after two nights without sleep

⸻

1. Debrief

Kael came back different.

Not overtly. He didn’t limp or mutter to himself. He wasn’t covered in blood or trailing black mist. But something about the air changed when he stepped off the elevator.

He moved like a man walking through water, heavy and slow. And his eyes—usually cold but clear—now looked… fogged. Like something had drawn the blinds inside his skull.

Commander Yu watched him from across the debrief room, her cybernetic eye clicking faintly as it zoomed in. She always made a point not to scan her crew unnecessarily. But tonight? She scanned.

His vitals were within acceptable parameters, but his EM signature was spiking and fluctuating every three seconds. As if he was pinging some invisible satellite.

“So,” Yu said, setting her coffee down. “What did you find?”

“False alarm,” Kael said. “No bodies. No signs of a breach. Possible EM pulse—low intensity.”

“Cause?” Rosie asked from her stool, arms crossed and eyes narrowed.

“Entropy,” Kael said flatly.

There was silence. The kind that tightens in the chest.

Rosie stood up. “Bullshit.”

Kael didn’t respond. Didn’t flinch. He just stood there with his gloved hands clasped behind his back like a soldier waiting for orders. But his jaw was twitching.

And when the lights flickered—just once—every eye turned toward him.

He left without another word.

⸻

2. The Lab

Dr. Wyatt Keller was always the first to laugh at something weird. That was his charm. That and the cargo pants with so many pockets he once lost a sandwich for three days in one.

But right now, he wasn’t laughing.

He was kneeling at Lab Station Delta, nose nearly pressed against a petri dish.

Inside: Sample 18.

It was a Martian slime—technically a non-carbon-based extremophile that had survived buried beneath seventy meters of polar ice, frozen for God knows how many millennia. Normally, it just wiggled around sluggishly, eating trace metals and humming a low electrical current like a biological capacitor.

But now?

Now it was moving.

With intent.

The slime rose in a slow spiral, forming a narrow, trembling helix. Then it dropped. Then rose again. As if trying to signal something. Morse code? A pattern?

Keller tapped the side of the dish.

The slime reacted—pulling away from his finger. Then rushing toward it. Then freezing.

“Oh,” he whispered, grin fading, “you’re watching me.”

He backed up slightly, reaching for his datapad.

Before he could begin recording, the slime collapsed flat and etched something into the bottom of the dish. Not with acid. Not with heat. Just… presence.

A triangle.

With a circle in the center.

His breath caught.

Then, slowly, the slime oozed up the side of the dish—stretching toward the glass of the observation port—as if reaching to draw again.

Behind it, in the corner of the lab, a loose pile of cables suddenly twitched.

Keller turned.

Nothing there.

Then came the sound—just three faint taps against the air duct panel.

Tap… tap… tap.

Like a knock.

Like something waiting to be let out.

⸻

3. Corridor Tension

Rosie walked the length of Corridor B, chewing on a protein bar and cursing under her breath.

“Send the Martian,” she muttered. “What could possibly go wrong? ‘Oh, just check out the haunted subdeck, Kael, you’re used to trauma!’”

She was angry, but mostly because she was scared. And she hated being scared.

When she passed the main viewport, she stopped cold.

Out in the darkness—far beyond Eos-7’s metal hull—was something.

A shadow.

Not a ship. Not a drone. Bigger.

Unmoving.

It didn’t glow. It didn’t pulse. It just was.

For a second, she thought the viewport had cracked, but no—just a line of frost.

She blinked.

The shape was gone.

But something deep inside her ears popped—like a pressure change. Or a voice she couldn’t hear.

The protein bar dropped from her hand.

⸻

4. Kael’s Quarters

Kael sat on his bunk, still wearing his gloves. He hadn’t taken them off since the sphere. He was afraid of what might be underneath now.

He kept staring at the wall.

There was a vent there—partially ajar.

He hadn’t opened it.

Every so often, the vent exhaled. Just a faint burst of warm air, like breath. Like something breathing with him.

He should’ve reported it. He didn’t.

Instead, he leaned forward and whispered:

“What are you?”

No response.

Then, in the glass of the small viewport, words slowly formed—etched in condensation from nowhere.

YOU BROUGHT US BACK

Kael swallowed hard.

Outside the station, there was no condensation.

So whose breath had written it?

⸻

5. The Dream Cycle

At 0230 hours, every crew member woke simultaneously.

Except Kael. He hadn’t slept.

Rosie’s dream: She was laying on an operating table. Her bones were being replaced with copper wires—each one carefully labeled with a language she didn’t recognize. The surgeon had her face.

Langley’s dream: He wandered an infinite library of mouths—shelves made of teeth, books whispering as they turned their own pages. In the distance, someone called his name using his mother’s voice, only it was decades older.

Keller’s dream: The slime climbed into his ears. Slid down his throat. Nestled in his chest. And whispered, “We are already in you. You are the first door.”

⸻

6. The Sphere

At 0400, alarms chimed.

Rosie was the first to arrive at Lab 2.

She stared through the reinforced glass, expecting a typical containment breach. Maybe Sample 18 had eaten through its dish again. Maybe someone had left the vacuum seal open.

Instead, she found the cradle empty.

The sphere—the one Kael never admitted finding—was gone.

The air around its former location hummed. Not audibly. But deep inside her skull, behind her eyes. Like a migraine waiting to happen.

Yu arrived seconds later. Her expression was carved from ice.

Kael arrived last.

He said nothing.

Because something was burned into the far wall of the lab.

Not drawn. Burned. Into titanium.

The same triangle. The same circle.

And beneath it: seven glyphs.

Not letters.

Not numbers.

Instructions.

Keller showed up, clutching a tablet full of scanned slime patterns.

“I’ve seen those,” he whispered. “Eighteen drew them last night. I think it’s trying to translate.”

“Translate what?” Rosie asked, exasperated.

Keller didn’t answer.

Because just then, the lights flickered again.

Only this time, they didn’t come back on.

⸻

Interlude: The Ghosts They Brought With Them

“We are not born with ghosts. We collect them. One memory at a time.”
— Kael Varn, before Eos-7

⸻

They didn’t talk much about Earth on Eos-7.

Not really.

Oh, sure, it came up during poker nights or when someone complained about the coffee. But no one ever sat down and truly remembered it. Maybe because it hurt. Maybe because they’d all left something behind. Maybe because they were afraid Earth could still see them through the void—watching.

But whether they talked about it or not, they all carried Earth like a scar across the heart. Every crew member. Every deck. Every breath.

And one of them didn’t carry Earth.

He carried Mars.

⸻

Kael Varn

“The Martian” | Weapons Systems Lead | Age: 32

Kael was born underground.
Not metaphorically—literally.

Mars was settled in waves: the first were scientists and engineers, sent to mine and test and terraform. The second were “security contractors” sent to keep order. The third were laborers, convicts, and refugees no longer welcome on Earth.

Kael’s mother was from the third wave. His father? No record.

The settlement he grew up in was called Redhold. At least, that’s what the locals called it. Earth called it Sector 6-M-Tau: a resource zone, not a home. Everything in Redhold existed to feed the machines that fed the ships that fed the economies of Earth. Water was filtered three times. Food came in bricks. People slept in shifts.

When Kael was eight, the first riots started.

The Martian Reclamation Movement—MRM—rose from those underground corridors, whispering about freedom and fire and how Earth had bled the planet dry then left them to die when the wells stopped pumping.

By ten, Kael was carrying messages between resistance cells.
By twelve, he was assembling weapons from spare mining equipment.
By fourteen, he was in his first firefight.

The war didn’t last long. Earth didn’t send soldiers. They sent drones. Orbit-to-surface strikes. Neural suppression fields. Blank-out gas.

Kael watched friends melt inside their suits. Watched his sister forget her own name for weeks after a suppression blast.

By seventeen, the war was over.

Earth didn’t win. Mars just lost. And the victors didn’t rebuild—they abandoned. The stations were sealed. Communications blacklisted. Earth moved on.

Mars became a graveyard of dreams and rust.

But Kael survived. He survived everything. And when Earth started sending peace envoys again—under the guise of collaboration, resource negotiation, “galactic unity”—Kael volunteered.

They thought it was redemption.
Kael knew it was infiltration.

He arrived on Eos-7 under a diplomatic science directive, assigned to develop non-lethal defensive tech. But he didn’t come to make friends.

He came to remember.
And to watch.

And maybe, if the stars aligned—to finish something his people started.

Rosie Tran

Systems Engineer | Earthside | Age: 34

Rosie grew up in Neo Saigon, in the wet shadows of glimmering towers built by corporations that barely registered the people living beneath them. Her mother worked hydrofarms during the day and coded at night. Her father was a local legend—an underground drone racer who disappeared during a raid when Rosie was twelve.

She learned to fix things early. Broken door? Rosie fixed it. Jammed exoframe? Rosie fixed it. Stolen orbital frequency scrambler? Well… Rosie didn’t just fix it—she made it better.

She applied to the Lunar Engineering Corps at fifteen and hacked her own admission records to get in. She’s never confessed that to anyone.

Rosie doesn’t trust authority, hates “company people,” and is allergic to protocol. But she cares—fiercely. Even if she shows it by yelling.

She doesn’t hate Kael.
But she doesn’t believe him, either.

And in quiet moments, she wonders if she’s going to have to kill him one day.

⸻

Dr. Wyatt Keller

Xenobiologist | Earth-Mars Transfer Specialist | Age: 38

Wyatt Keller used to be respected.

Before the “incident.”

Before the conference.

Before the footage.

He was Earth’s rising xenobiology star—first to decode Martian spore-lattice speech, first to identify the neural resonance of the Sevast Ring Coral, first to shake hands (metaphorically) with a sentient dust colony from Gliese IV.

Then came his paper: “Biological Semiotics in Non-Human Consciousness: Communication or Summoning?”

People laughed.

Then they distanced themselves.

Then the footage leaked—him in a sealed room, watching Martian slime form ancient glyphs on the wall while whispering back to it. Responding.

Now Keller was a cautionary tale.

But Eos-7 needed a xenobiologist who wasn’t afraid of the weird.

So here he was—half scientist, half pariah, all anxiety—humming nervously to himself and wondering if maybe, just maybe, he hadn’t been wrong.

⸻

Commander Aiko Yu

Commander of Eos-7 | Former Earth Navy | Age: 42

Yu was born in orbit.

She spent more time in artificial gravity than planetary.

Daughter of military royalty, she attended every elite program Earth could offer, and graduated top of her class at the Orbital Strategic Command College. She ran ops on Ganymede during the piracy crises. She cleared the Karash Debris Belt in two weeks when it was declared impassable. She was promoted fast. Too fast.

Then came The Hollowbridge Tragedy.

Seventeen crew. One survivor.

Yu.

The investigation cleared her.

The public didn’t.

So when the Eos-7 peace initiative was announced, she volunteered. Not for redemption.

But because space was the only place she still felt real.

Yu never raises her voice. Never breaks form. But she watches Kael like a hawk.

And something about him makes her grip her old sidearm just a little tighter.

⸻

Langley Rhodes

Communications Officer | Age: 28

Langley was raised in the arctic ruins of northern Canada. Born after the Great Grid Collapse, he grew up in a world of ice and silence. His parents were isolationists, his siblings disappeared one by one, and Langley learned to talk to machines before he ever learned to talk to people.

He has a natural ear for patterns—he can find the melody in any transmission, the lie in any signal.

On Eos-7, he monitors deep-space channels and filters out “the noise.” Lately, though, the noise has been talking back.

He doesn’t trust Kael.

Not because he’s from Mars.

Because Kael’s voice has a shadow signal. Like two people speaking from the same mouth.

⸻

Together, But Not Aligned

Eos-7 was never about research. Not really.

It was a symbol—a space station on the fringe of known territory, crewed by Earth’s best and brightest, plus one politically inconvenient Martian. A promise of unity.

A fragile one.

Kael knows they don’t trust him.
Rosie knows he’s holding back.
Keller thinks he’s important.
Yu thinks he’s dangerous.
Langley thinks he’s not alone.

And none of them know what Kael saw when that alarm went off.
What touched him.
What woke up.

But soon, they will.

And by then?

It might be far, far too late.

——

Chapter 1, Part 3 – The Triangle That Screams

“It’s not expanding. We’re shrinking.”
— Langley Rhodes

⸻

Kael hadn’t slept since the anomaly.

He couldn’t sleep—not really. Not in the way that felt human. He’d close his eyes and be back there: staring into that impossible geometry, into the anomaly that pulsed like a throat trying to swallow light. Every time he blinked, he saw it again. Not like a memory—like it was still happening. Like it had left a window open in his mind and was still reaching through it.

It wasn’t just the vision. It was the voice. Not words. Not language.

But meaning. Whispered behind the folds of reality.

And something else, too—something old. Like the Martian archives deep under Redhold. Dusty. Cracked. Ancient beyond measure.

Except this wasn’t Martian. This was other.

He woke up gasping most cycles now, skin damp, heart pacing like it was being hunted. But he couldn’t tell them. Not yet. Not ever, maybe.

They already looked at him like a loaded gun.

Now they’d just see a broken one.

⸻

Yu had called a lockdown.

Whatever triggered the breach on Deck D—whatever set off the alert Kael had responded to—it hadn’t shown up on the station’s diagnostics. No hull damage. No atmospheric shift. No contamination.

Nothing.

Except Kael’s vitals.

That part was flagged. His pulse, brainwave patterns, neural activity—it all looked like someone who’d been electrocuted. Or struck by lightning.

But when asked, Kael said he “didn’t see anything.”

Yu didn’t press. She just nodded once, clipped her reply, and walked away like she didn’t quite buy it but couldn’t prove otherwise.

Keller, on the other hand, was vibrating with excitement.

He’d cornered Kael during a corridor scan two cycles later, clutching a tablet and babbling about “patterned thought matrices” and “multi-phasic psychic disruption fields.”

“You’ve seen it, haven’t you?” Keller whispered, leaning in close. “The sphere. The lattice. The mind-shape.”

Kael didn’t answer.

Because he had seen it.

And now it was spreading.

⸻

It started with sound.

Langley was the first to notice. He was cataloging background station noise—scrubbing static, aligning deep-space pings—when he found it.

A triangle.

Not in shape, in tone. Three frequencies looping inside each other. Not overlapping. Not layered. Nested. And wrong. Not because of the math, but because of the feel. It was like being watched with your ears.

He pulled Rosie in.

They argued. Loudly.

“It’s probably a machine feedback loop,” she said.

“There’s no machine that does this,” he snapped. “Not without a consciousness behind it.”

They played it back through the corridor speakers. Just once.

Keller vomited halfway through. Rosie got a nosebleed. Kael… just stared. And smiled.

For a moment.

Then he stopped smiling.

And told them never to play it again.

They didn’t.

But it kept playing anyway.

Sometimes late at night, when the station lights dimmed and the halls creaked from heat shifts, Langley swore he could hear it behind the walls—the triangle.

A song from something without lungs.

⸻

Three days after the anomaly, Rosie’s drone got stuck in a place that didn’t exist.

It was supposed to be a standard structural sweep—Deck G, lower conduit crawlspace. She was piloting remotely when the feed went dark. No loss of signal. No warning.

Just gone.

When she pulled the last few frames from the visual cache, her hands froze over the console.

Because the drone had turned left… into a wall.

Not a malfunction. Not a graphical glitch.

A wall that wasn’t supposed to be there. That wasn’t there.

She ran a full diagnostic of the deck layout. Schematic confirmed: the corridor stopped at a maintenance panel.

But the drone had turned into something else.

A space that shouldn’t exist.

They suited up and went to check.

⸻

Kael led. Rosie and Yu flanked him. Langley stayed back to monitor vitals. Keller begged to come but was denied.

Deck G was cold. The temperature sensors were off by four degrees—colder than it should’ve been, like the walls were breathing in.

They found the wall. Seamless. Clean. Like it had always been there. But Rosie’s scanner showed the impossible—energy readings curling behind the false barrier like smoke trapped in crystal.

Kael pressed his hand against it.

Something responded.

Not physically. Psychically.

He felt a pull. Not like gravity. Like recognition. Like whatever was back there knew him now.

And then the wall flickered.

For a second.

Just one.

A thin band of reality tore open like wet paper—and Kael saw through.

Not far. Just enough.

Enough to see the chamber beyond.

A sphere floated there, humming. Not like the first one. This one was black. Not colorless. Not dark.

Black.

Like it was eating light.

Wrapped around it was a cage of symbols—twisting, shifting language that looked like it had been written by time itself. Pulsing with memory.

He couldn’t read it.

But he understood one thing:

It was a door.

And it had started to open.

⸻

They left in silence. Yu sealed the hall. Rosie filed a malfunction report that no one would ever read.

Langley turned off the triangle feed.

Keller prayed.

And Kael…

Kael sat in the dark and whispered a name he didn’t know he remembered.

“Vosh.”

And deep inside the hidden chamber, the black sphere pulsed once—

—and whispered back.

1jtpccx,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1jtpccx/can_you_hear_me_silence_i_am_speaking_to_you/,"Can you hear me, silence? I am speaking to you…","You may choose not to respond, but that does not mean I can remain silent. I long for your words, for some sign that you hear me. I cannot know what’s happening inside your mind, but I hope that my writing – into the silence, into the void, but really, to you – doesn’t frighten you, doesn’t make you want to run further from me than you already have.

In the last six months, I’ve stood before you countless times, though only for fleeting moments –  except for that one time, when we shared coffee and walked together. 

From the first instant I met you, I sensed something different, an unspoken connection. But when we touched, in the simplest of exchanges, and I met your gaze, I felt something I’ve never experienced before. It was an inexplicable feeling, one that ignited every cell in my body, something that only happens with you. I cannot explain it, but I’ve learned to embrace it.

I knew then that I needed to know you, to understand this connection, this… *us*. I cannot simply walk away from you. I’ve given this a great deal of thought, and there’s much more I haven’t yet said – but know this: I want this. I want *you*. I’ve been here all along – can you really not feel my presence?

It feels as though you keep pushing me away, not because you don’t care, but because facing the truth of your feelings seems too overwhelming or like you’re not worthy of them, or of me maybe? Again, I’m not a mind reader, so you leave me to assumptions, which are something I hate making, because they can be so very wrong. 

I understand the need for space, for time to sort through it all – and that’s okay. But when you retreat into silence, when you shut me out in anger and say nothing at all, it leaves me feeling as if I’m losing my mind. Yet, deep down, I know I am not delusional. I’ve seen the way you look at me, the way our souls intertwine. This cannot be one-sided.

The last thing I ever wanted was to make you feel uncomfortable or as though I were imposing my feelings upon you – that was never my intent. All I wanted was to be honest, to share my heart before more time slips away. I’ve been carrying these emotions for six months.

Do you want me to be angry? Is that what you expect from me? I know you’ve shared that trust doesn’t come easily for you, and that you’re shy. Perhaps you’re accustomed to chaos, to dramatic and unpredictable reactions from others – but that’s not who I am.

I don’t share my feelings publicly, and I’ve never done this before. Yet, I make this exception for you. Why? Because I can no longer contain these emotions, and I don’t know how else to reach you.

I’ve remained strong because I’ve had to – it’s the mask I’ve learned to wear. You have no idea what I’ve endured in my life, just as I cannot fully understand the depths of your own struggles. But I want to. I want to know you, to understand the weight you carry.

I’ve kept it all inside, partly because that’s what society expects, partly because I didn’t want to risk forming a trauma bond. But also, because I understand you are carrying something heavy. I sensed it the moment I first saw you, even though you’ve hidden it well. I know the depth of your struggle – though it’s different from mine, it is also the same. I know you don’t want to burden me, but I want you to know that I’m here, that I’m ready to stand with you. And I need you to stand with me, too.

But there’s something I must tell you that you may not want to hear: you are not the only one hurting. I understand why you didn’t confide in me sooner – it was too soon, and we weren’t that close. But I wanted to know. I wanted to help. I still do.

What I need now is clarity. A conversation – face to face, as I’ve been asking for, for months. There is so much I’ve longed to say, but I need to see your eyes. I can’t make assumptions about your letters, not knowing whether they are meant for me, for her, or someone else entirely. I’ve wondered countless times if you were writing to me, only to find something that contradicts it, sending me into confusion. I can’t live in this uncertainty. The changing usernames, the vague messages – all of it forces me to guess, and I am exhausted by it.

I think in facts, in logic. I don’t like assumptions, but when you leave me in silence, you force me to make them. I know you’re shy, that you’re unsure of what to say, and I understand that. But silence only fuels my overthinking. I can’t stop my mind from running through every possible scenario – just as I know you do the same.

So, I ask this of you:  Please, speak to me – reach out in whatever way feels right. Call me, text me, email me – directly. I would love nothing more than to see you, whether it’s for coffee, a walk, at my place, etc... Wherever it may be, I need to know your thoughts. I need to look into your eyes, for they, more than anything, will reveal what words cannot.",2,1744042960.0,LoveLetters,0,1.0,False

Echoes Beyond Orbit

Prologue: Welcome to Eos-7

“Out here, in the black silence, jokes are worth more than gold.” — Commander Jenna Yu

Transmission Date: August 13, 2193

Location: Eos-7 Orbital Research Facility

Distance from Earth: 187,000 miles

The stars didn’t twinkle from this distance—they pulsed like slow heartbeats, distant and cold. From the panoramic viewport on Deck C of Eos-7, Earth looked like a cloudy marble suspended in a velvet sea. Above it all, the station orbited with quiet grace, a skeletal ring of steel and solar sails, its blinking beacon barely visible to passing satellites and occasional supply drones.

Eos-7 wasn’t a military station. Not officially, anyway.

It was a “cooperative research facility,” the first of its kind. The goal? Bring Earth’s fractured powers—corporate, governmental, and Martian—together under one roof and aim their collective genius toward the future of weapons technology, propulsion systems, and deep-space communications. Peace through paranoia.

And the crew?

Well, the crew was… something else.

⸻

Meet the Team

Commander Jenna Yu – EarthGov Veteran (New Chicago, Earth)

Jenna had the kind of jawline that looked like it could cut glass and the kind of dry wit that could crack titanium. She’d done three tours in the Jovian Belt Wars and walked out of the last one with a cybernetic eye, a new distaste for bureaucracy, and a habit of talking to herself when she thought no one was listening.

Her motto: “Don’t panic unless I panic. And if I panic, well… start praying.”

People respected her, even when she barked orders in her bathrobe and bunny slippers.

⸻

Dr. Wyatt Keller – Astrobiologist (Memphis Free Zone, Earth)

Wyatt was the “funny one,” or at least, that’s what he kept telling people. He once did a six-minute standup routine during a blackout, using only glowsticks and a severed maintenance drone arm as a prop.

He had a cat named Schröder back on Earth who he called every Sunday. Yes, video-called. Yes, he claimed the cat understood him.

His lab was full of slime cultures and snack wrappers, and he smelled faintly of mango-flavored protein bars.

⸻

Chief Engineer Rosario “Rosie” Delgado – Tech Genius (New Bogotá Arcology)

Rosie was a walking miracle of caffeine and spite. She could fix a broken reactor with duct tape and a half-melted spanner and still make it to movie night with time to complain about the popcorn.

Raised by hackers in the underbelly of a crumbling arcology, she’d made her way up by hacking into a government-sponsored engineering contest—and winning. Twice.

Her arms were sleeved in tattoos: equations, blueprints, and one suspicious barcode no one dared ask about.

⸻

Ensign Bo “Lunchbox” Langley – Station Cook & Former MMA Champ (Alabama Sector, Earth)

No one really knew why Langley was there. Officially, he was “station logistics.” Unofficially, he made the best gumbo in orbit and could bench press a zero-G rover.

His nickname came from an incident involving a high-gravity cafeteria brawl, a steel lunchbox, and three diplomats from the Lunar Federation. None of them pressed charges.

Langley wore a different apron every day, all with aggressively positive slogans. Today’s read: “Stirring Up Trouble (and Stew)”

⸻

Kael Thorne – Weapons Specialist (Ares Basin Colony, Mars)

And then… there was Kael.

He didn’t laugh at jokes. He didn’t smile. He rarely blinked. His eyes were too pale, his accent too clipped, and his uniform always immaculate. He’d grown up in the Martian Dust Camps—settlements of fringe survivalists, separatists, and, in recent decades, insurgents.

He wasn’t technically a terrorist, but his father had bombed a hydroponics dome on Europa, and Kael had spent time in a lunar detention facility. Still, after the Martian Accords were signed, EarthGov needed a gesture. A peace offering.

So they gave him a lab and access to some of the most dangerous tech humanity had ever developed.

Everyone called him “Red.” Not to his face.

And Kael?

He called them “soft.”

⸻

Life on Eos-7

Most days were the same. They woke up, ate protein sludge or whatever Langley managed to scrape together, and worked in their labs. The days blurred together in a haze of research logs, minor malfunctions, and increasingly bizarre inside jokes.

There was a running tally in the mess hall titled: “Things That’ll Kill Us First.”
	•	Reactor Core Failure: 3 votes
	•	Airlock Misuse: 2 votes
	•	Alien Fungus in Wyatt’s Fridge: 4 votes
	•	Rosie Snapping and Overwriting Life Support: 6 votes
	•	Kael: 7 votes

Kael never acknowledged the list.

He just worked.

In his lab, he built drone prototypes and gravitic pulse emitters, tested energy weapons that could disintegrate a ship from across the solar system, and occasionally stared out the window for long stretches of time.

When asked what he was thinking about, he simply replied:

“Escape velocity.”

⸻

The Quiet Before

What no one knew—not even Kael—was that deep in the lower levels of Eos-7, behind reinforced panels and encryption walls no one had touched in years, something was beginning to stir.

A looped message played in an abandoned communications array, repeating in binary:

“WHO WROTE THE SIGNAL
WHO WROTE THE SIGNAL
WHO WROTE THE SIGNAL”

It had been broadcasting for six months.

No one had checked that section of the station since Eos-5 went silent.

No one wanted to.

⸻

Closing Transmission Log – Day 312

COMMANDER YU: All systems stable. No anomalies. Morale is surprisingly good. Kael even joined game night. He didn’t play, but he watched. I think that counts for something.

DR. WYATT KELLER: I fed my space mold a piece of gummy worm. It grew legs. Is that bad?

ROSIE DELGADO: If the AI makes one more sarcastic comment about my dating history, I will turn it into a calculator.

BO LANGLEY: Today’s stew is made from rehydrated okra and questionable chicken. Godspeed.

KAEL THORNE: Power fluctuations in Deck D. Possible sabotage. Or entropy. Doesn’t matter. I’ll handle it.

⸻

And somewhere, in the dark corridors of Eos-7, a door hissed open.

It hadn’t been opened in over 14 years.

No one heard it.

Except the station.

⸻

[END OF PROLOGUE]


Chapter One: Things That Shouldn’t Move in Zero Gravity

Part One: The Loser Goes First

“If I vanish, don’t come looking. If I scream, especially don’t come looking.” — Kael Thorne, moments before descending below Deck F

The alarm started just after midnight, station time.

A low, keening chime that pulsed once every seven seconds. Not loud, but insistent—like a drip in a dark room. It echoed down the metal bones of Eos-7, interrupting sleep cycles and shower schedules, echoing through empty labs and humming corridors like a forgotten nursery rhyme.

Deck G—abandoned, power-deprived, officially sealed after the reactor expansion six years ago. No one went down there anymore. Not since the reshuffling. Not since Eos-5.

Still, the alarm was real. Rosie confirmed it. Low-priority, localized to a single junction. But no known cause.

Which meant a vote.

⸻

The crew gathered in the mess, everyone still half-asleep and dressed like mismatched dolls from different centuries.

Rosie had her hair in a messy bun and grease on her cheek. Keller was wrapped in his “Space Camp 2189” blanket like a monk. Langley clutched a steaming mug of something thick and aggressive-smelling. Commander Yu presided with her usual sigh of eternal patience, sipping black coffee and narrowing her cybernetic eye.

Kael stood at the end of the table, silent. Watching.

No one made eye contact.

Votes were cast. Secretly, to avoid blood feuds. Standard procedure.

Final Tally:
Langley – 0
Keller – 0 (on account of “he’d get eaten first”)
Rosie – 1 (her own vote, bitterly)
Commander Yu – 0
Kael – 4

He didn’t protest. Didn’t blink. Just stood, nodded once, and turned.

Rosie muttered under her breath: “At least he doesn’t need a flashlight—his rage glows in the dark.”

⸻

Descent

The elevator to Deck G wheezed like it hadn’t moved in a decade. It probably hadn’t. The lights inside flickered as Kael rode down in silence, cradling a modified rail pistol and a narrow-beam lantern.

When the doors opened, they exhaled dust.

Deck G wasn’t like the rest of Eos-7. There were no friendly AI chirps, no maintenance drones buzzing about. The air felt… heavier. Like the gravity was wrong, just slightly off by a fraction. The hallway stretched ahead in a tight metal throat, walls scratched and unpainted, cables dangling from ceiling panels like nervous veins.

And then he heard it.

A whisper. No language. Just sound. Almost like radio static crawling through a dying man’s lungs.

khhhhhhhh…hrrkkk…who…wrote…the…signal…

His breath fogged.

No other deck was this cold.

⸻

The Anomaly

It was near Junction 9, where the schematic said nothing existed except a welded shut maintenance shaft.

But the door wasn’t welded anymore.

It stood open.

Beyond it: a small chamber. Triangular walls. A floor made of metal plates with markings he didn’t recognize. In the center—hovering exactly one meter off the ground—was a sphere.

Black. Glossy. Perfectly still.

Kael froze.

His heart pounded, but not with fear. With recognition.

⸻

Flashback

The smell of Martian dust. That dry, electric sting of static on red soil. The low rumble of thunder from underground detonations. His father’s voice, screaming over a shortwave: “The Earthmen will never understand what they’ve stolen!”

He was sixteen again. Standing in the ruins of Habitat Theta, cradling his sister’s broken body, half-buried in collapsed rebar. Watching the EarthGov drones sweep through the wreckage like scavengers with sirens.

He remembered the heat. The hunger. The silence after.

Kael clenched his fists.

His vision blurred.

The room flickered.

⸻

The Change

He staggered forward—against his will. Like something in the air had hooked into his chest and pulled.

The sphere pulsed.

Once.

Then again.

It wasn’t glowing. It was absorbing. Light, heat, memory.

“Kael.”

The voice wasn’t his father’s.

It wasn’t human.

It was inside him.

For a moment, he couldn’t move. Then he saw his own hand rise without command, reaching toward the object. Just before contact, the lights in the chamber exploded—every bulb, every panel.

Darkness.

And then—white fire.

His mind was fracturing. Thoughts that weren’t his, images from futures that hadn’t happened. A dead Earth. A torn sky. Himself—older, taller, mouth stitched shut—screaming silently from the ruins of Eos-7.

⸻

Return

Kael woke on the floor.

The chamber was quiet again. The sphere gone.

His fingers sparked. Tiny arcs of electricity danced across his knuckles, vanishing before they could register. His breath no longer fogged the air.

He stood slowly.

And then he heard the whisper again.

But this time… it was laughing.

⸻

[TO BE CONTINUED] 

Chapter One: Things That Shouldn’t Move in Zero Gravity

Part Two: The Signal That Watches Back 

“The universe doesn’t care if we’re scared. That’s what makes it scary.”
— Rosie Tran, Systems Engineer, after two nights without sleep

⸻

1. Debrief

Kael came back different.

Not overtly. He didn’t limp or mutter to himself. He wasn’t covered in blood or trailing black mist. But something about the air changed when he stepped off the elevator.

He moved like a man walking through water, heavy and slow. And his eyes—usually cold but clear—now looked… fogged. Like something had drawn the blinds inside his skull.

Commander Yu watched him from across the debrief room, her cybernetic eye clicking faintly as it zoomed in. She always made a point not to scan her crew unnecessarily. But tonight? She scanned.

His vitals were within acceptable parameters, but his EM signature was spiking and fluctuating every three seconds. As if he was pinging some invisible satellite.

“So,” Yu said, setting her coffee down. “What did you find?”

“False alarm,” Kael said. “No bodies. No signs of a breach. Possible EM pulse—low intensity.”

“Cause?” Rosie asked from her stool, arms crossed and eyes narrowed.

“Entropy,” Kael said flatly.

There was silence. The kind that tightens in the chest.

Rosie stood up. “Bullshit.”

Kael didn’t respond. Didn’t flinch. He just stood there with his gloved hands clasped behind his back like a soldier waiting for orders. But his jaw was twitching.

And when the lights flickered—just once—every eye turned toward him.

He left without another word.

⸻

2. The Lab

Dr. Wyatt Keller was always the first to laugh at something weird. That was his charm. That and the cargo pants with so many pockets he once lost a sandwich for three days in one.

But right now, he wasn’t laughing.

He was kneeling at Lab Station Delta, nose nearly pressed against a petri dish.

Inside: Sample 18.

It was a Martian slime—technically a non-carbon-based extremophile that had survived buried beneath seventy meters of polar ice, frozen for God knows how many millennia. Normally, it just wiggled around sluggishly, eating trace metals and humming a low electrical current like a biological capacitor.

But now?

Now it was moving.

With intent.

The slime rose in a slow spiral, forming a narrow, trembling helix. Then it dropped. Then rose again. As if trying to signal something. Morse code? A pattern?

Keller tapped the side of the dish.

The slime reacted—pulling away from his finger. Then rushing toward it. Then freezing.

“Oh,” he whispered, grin fading, “you’re watching me.”

He backed up slightly, reaching for his datapad.

Before he could begin recording, the slime collapsed flat and etched something into the bottom of the dish. Not with acid. Not with heat. Just… presence.

A triangle.

With a circle in the center.

His breath caught.

Then, slowly, the slime oozed up the side of the dish—stretching toward the glass of the observation port—as if reaching to draw again.

Behind it, in the corner of the lab, a loose pile of cables suddenly twitched.

Keller turned.

Nothing there.

Then came the sound—just three faint taps against the air duct panel.

Tap… tap… tap.

Like a knock.

Like something waiting to be let out.

⸻

3. Corridor Tension

Rosie walked the length of Corridor B, chewing on a protein bar and cursing under her breath.

“Send the Martian,” she muttered. “What could possibly go wrong? ‘Oh, just check out the haunted subdeck, Kael, you’re used to trauma!’”

She was angry, but mostly because she was scared. And she hated being scared.

When she passed the main viewport, she stopped cold.

Out in the darkness—far beyond Eos-7’s metal hull—was something.

A shadow.

Not a ship. Not a drone. Bigger.

Unmoving.

It didn’t glow. It didn’t pulse. It just was.

For a second, she thought the viewport had cracked, but no—just a line of frost.

She blinked.

The shape was gone.

But something deep inside her ears popped—like a pressure change. Or a voice she couldn’t hear.

The protein bar dropped from her hand.

⸻

4. Kael’s Quarters

Kael sat on his bunk, still wearing his gloves. He hadn’t taken them off since the sphere. He was afraid of what might be underneath now.

He kept staring at the wall.

There was a vent there—partially ajar.

He hadn’t opened it.

Every so often, the vent exhaled. Just a faint burst of warm air, like breath. Like something breathing with him.

He should’ve reported it. He didn’t.

Instead, he leaned forward and whispered:

“What are you?”

No response.

Then, in the glass of the small viewport, words slowly formed—etched in condensation from nowhere.

YOU BROUGHT US BACK

Kael swallowed hard.

Outside the station, there was no condensation.

So whose breath had written it?

⸻

5. The Dream Cycle

At 0230 hours, every crew member woke simultaneously.

Except Kael. He hadn’t slept.

Rosie’s dream: She was laying on an operating table. Her bones were being replaced with copper wires—each one carefully labeled with a language she didn’t recognize. The surgeon had her face.

Langley’s dream: He wandered an infinite library of mouths—shelves made of teeth, books whispering as they turned their own pages. In the distance, someone called his name using his mother’s voice, only it was decades older.

Keller’s dream: The slime climbed into his ears. Slid down his throat. Nestled in his chest. And whispered, “We are already in you. You are the first door.”

⸻

6. The Sphere

At 0400, alarms chimed.

Rosie was the first to arrive at Lab 2.

She stared through the reinforced glass, expecting a typical containment breach. Maybe Sample 18 had eaten through its dish again. Maybe someone had left the vacuum seal open.

Instead, she found the cradle empty.

The sphere—the one Kael never admitted finding—was gone.

The air around its former location hummed. Not audibly. But deep inside her skull, behind her eyes. Like a migraine waiting to happen.

Yu arrived seconds later. Her expression was carved from ice.

Kael arrived last.

He said nothing.

Because something was burned into the far wall of the lab.

Not drawn. Burned. Into titanium.

The same triangle. The same circle.

And beneath it: seven glyphs.

Not letters.

Not numbers.

Instructions.

Keller showed up, clutching a tablet full of scanned slime patterns.

“I’ve seen those,” he whispered. “Eighteen drew them last night. I think it’s trying to translate.”

“Translate what?” Rosie asked, exasperated.

Keller didn’t answer.

Because just then, the lights flickered again.

Only this time, they didn’t come back on.

⸻

Interlude: The Ghosts They Brought With Them

“We are not born with ghosts. We collect them. One memory at a time.”
— Kael Varn, before Eos-7

⸻

They didn’t talk much about Earth on Eos-7.

Not really.

Oh, sure, it came up during poker nights or when someone complained about the coffee. But no one ever sat down and truly remembered it. Maybe because it hurt. Maybe because they’d all left something behind. Maybe because they were afraid Earth could still see them through the void—watching.

But whether they talked about it or not, they all carried Earth like a scar across the heart. Every crew member. Every deck. Every breath.

And one of them didn’t carry Earth.

He carried Mars.

⸻

Kael Varn

“The Martian” | Weapons Systems Lead | Age: 32

Kael was born underground.
Not metaphorically—literally.

Mars was settled in waves: the first were scientists and engineers, sent to mine and test and terraform. The second were “security contractors” sent to keep order. The third were laborers, convicts, and refugees no longer welcome on Earth.

Kael’s mother was from the third wave. His father? No record.

The settlement he grew up in was called Redhold. At least, that’s what the locals called it. Earth called it Sector 6-M-Tau: a resource zone, not a home. Everything in Redhold existed to feed the machines that fed the ships that fed the economies of Earth. Water was filtered three times. Food came in bricks. People slept in shifts.

When Kael was eight, the first riots started.

The Martian Reclamation Movement—MRM—rose from those underground corridors, whispering about freedom and fire and how Earth had bled the planet dry then left them to die when the wells stopped pumping.

By ten, Kael was carrying messages between resistance cells.
By twelve, he was assembling weapons from spare mining equipment.
By fourteen, he was in his first firefight.

The war didn’t last long. Earth didn’t send soldiers. They sent drones. Orbit-to-surface strikes. Neural suppression fields. Blank-out gas.

Kael watched friends melt inside their suits. Watched his sister forget her own name for weeks after a suppression blast.

By seventeen, the war was over.

Earth didn’t win. Mars just lost. And the victors didn’t rebuild—they abandoned. The stations were sealed. Communications blacklisted. Earth moved on.

Mars became a graveyard of dreams and rust.

But Kael survived. He survived everything. And when Earth started sending peace envoys again—under the guise of collaboration, resource negotiation, “galactic unity”—Kael volunteered.

They thought it was redemption.
Kael knew it was infiltration.

He arrived on Eos-7 under a diplomatic science directive, assigned to develop non-lethal defensive tech. But he didn’t come to make friends.

He came to remember.
And to watch.

And maybe, if the stars aligned—to finish something his people started.

⸻

Rosie Tran

Systems Engineer | Earthside | Age: 34

Rosie grew up in Neo Saigon, in the wet shadows of glimmering towers built by corporations that barely registered the people living beneath them. Her mother worked hydrofarms during the day and coded at night. Her father was a local legend—an underground drone racer who disappeared during a raid when Rosie was twelve.

She learned to fix things early. Broken door? Rosie fixed it. Jammed exoframe? Rosie fixed it. Stolen orbital frequency scrambler? Well… Rosie didn’t just fix it—she made it better.

She applied to the Lunar Engineering Corps at fifteen and hacked her own admission records to get in. She’s never confessed that to anyone.

Rosie doesn’t trust authority, hates “company people,” and is allergic to protocol. But she cares—fiercely. Even if she shows it by yelling.

She doesn’t hate Kael.
But she doesn’t believe him, either.

And in quiet moments, she wonders if she’s going to have to kill him one day.

⸻

Dr. Wyatt Keller

Xenobiologist | Earth-Mars Transfer Specialist | Age: 38

Wyatt Keller used to be respected.

Before the “incident.”

Before the conference.

Before the footage.

He was Earth’s rising xenobiology star—first to decode Martian spore-lattice speech, first to identify the neural resonance of the Sevast Ring Coral, first to shake hands (metaphorically) with a sentient dust colony from Gliese IV.

Then came his paper: “Biological Semiotics in Non-Human Consciousness: Communication or Summoning?”

People laughed.

Then they distanced themselves.

Then the footage leaked—him in a sealed room, watching Martian slime form ancient glyphs on the wall while whispering back to it. Responding.

Now Keller was a cautionary tale.

But Eos-7 needed a xenobiologist who wasn’t afraid of the weird.

So here he was—half scientist, half pariah, all anxiety—humming nervously to himself and wondering if maybe, just maybe, he hadn’t been wrong.

⸻

Commander Aiko Yu

Commander of Eos-7 | Former Earth Navy | Age: 42

Yu was born in orbit.

She spent more time in artificial gravity than planetary.

Daughter of military royalty, she attended every elite program Earth could offer, and graduated top of her class at the Orbital Strategic Command College. She ran ops on Ganymede during the piracy crises. She cleared the Karash Debris Belt in two weeks when it was declared impassable. She was promoted fast. Too fast.

Then came The Hollowbridge Tragedy.

Seventeen crew. One survivor.

Yu.

The investigation cleared her.

The public didn’t.

So when the Eos-7 peace initiative was announced, she volunteered. Not for redemption.

But because space was the only place she still felt real.

Yu never raises her voice. Never breaks form. But she watches Kael like a hawk.

And something about him makes her grip her old sidearm just a little tighter.

⸻

Langley Rhodes

Communications Officer | Age: 28

Langley was raised in the arctic ruins of northern Canada. Born after the Great Grid Collapse, he grew up in a world of ice and silence. His parents were isolationists, his siblings disappeared one by one, and Langley learned to talk to machines before he ever learned to talk to people.

He has a natural ear for patterns—he can find the melody in any transmission, the lie in any signal.

On Eos-7, he monitors deep-space channels and filters out “the noise.” Lately, though, the noise has been talking back.

He doesn’t trust Kael.

Not because he’s from Mars.

Because Kael’s voice has a shadow signal. Like two people speaking from the same mouth.

⸻

Together, But Not Aligned

Eos-7 was never about research. Not really.

It was a symbol—a space station on the fringe of known territory, crewed by Earth’s best and brightest, plus one politically inconvenient Martian. A promise of unity.

A fragile one.

Kael knows they don’t trust him.
Rosie knows he’s holding back.
Keller thinks he’s important.
Yu thinks he’s dangerous.
Langley thinks he’s not alone.

And none of them know what Kael saw when that alarm went off.
What touched him.
What woke up.

But soon, they will.

And by then?

It might be far, far too late.

——

Chapter 1, Part 3 – The Triangle That Screams

“It’s not expanding. We’re shrinking.”
— Langley Rhodes

⸻

Kael hadn’t slept since the anomaly.

He couldn’t sleep—not really. Not in the way that felt human. He’d close his eyes and be back there: staring into that impossible geometry, into the anomaly that pulsed like a throat trying to swallow light. Every time he blinked, he saw it again. Not like a memory—like it was still happening. Like it had left a window open in his mind and was still reaching through it.

It wasn’t just the vision. It was the voice. Not words. Not language.

But meaning. Whispered behind the folds of reality.

And something else, too—something old. Like the Martian archives deep under Redhold. Dusty. Cracked. Ancient beyond measure.

Except this wasn’t Martian. This was other.

He woke up gasping most cycles now, skin damp, heart pacing like it was being hunted. But he couldn’t tell them. Not yet. Not ever, maybe.

They already looked at him like a loaded gun.

Now they’d just see a broken one.

⸻

Yu had called a lockdown.

Whatever triggered the breach on Deck D—whatever set off the alert Kael had responded to—it hadn’t shown up on the station’s diagnostics. No hull damage. No atmospheric shift. No contamination.

Nothing.

Except Kael’s vitals.

That part was flagged. His pulse, brainwave patterns, neural activity—it all looked like someone who’d been electrocuted. Or struck by lightning.

But when asked, Kael said he “didn’t see anything.”

Yu didn’t press. She just nodded once, clipped her reply, and walked away like she didn’t quite buy it but couldn’t prove otherwise.

Keller, on the other hand, was vibrating with excitement.

He’d cornered Kael during a corridor scan two cycles later, clutching a tablet and babbling about “patterned thought matrices” and “multi-phasic psychic disruption fields.”

“You’ve seen it, haven’t you?” Keller whispered, leaning in close. “The sphere. The lattice. The mind-shape.”

Kael didn’t answer.

Because he had seen it.

And now it was spreading.

⸻

It started with sound.

Langley was the first to notice. He was cataloging background station noise—scrubbing static, aligning deep-space pings—when he found it.

A triangle.

Not in shape, in tone. Three frequencies looping inside each other. Not overlapping. Not layered. Nested. And wrong. Not because of the math, but because of the feel. It was like being watched with your ears.

He pulled Rosie in.

They argued. Loudly.

“It’s probably a machine feedback loop,” she said.

“There’s no machine that does this,” he snapped. “Not without a consciousness behind it.”

They played it back through the corridor speakers. Just once.

Keller vomited halfway through. Rosie got a nosebleed. Kael… just stared. And smiled.

For a moment.

Then he stopped smiling.

And told them never to play it again.

They didn’t.

But it kept playing anyway.

Sometimes late at night, when the station lights dimmed and the halls creaked from heat shifts, Langley swore he could hear it behind the walls—the triangle.

A song from something without lungs.

⸻

Three days after the anomaly, Rosie’s drone got stuck in a place that didn’t exist.

It was supposed to be a standard structural sweep—Deck G, lower conduit crawlspace. She was piloting remotely when the feed went dark. No loss of signal. No warning.

Just gone.

When she pulled the last few frames from the visual cache, her hands froze over the console.

Because the drone had turned left… into a wall.

Not a malfunction. Not a graphical glitch.

A wall that wasn’t supposed to be there. That wasn’t there.

She ran a full diagnostic of the deck layout. Schematic confirmed: the corridor stopped at a maintenance panel.

But the drone had turned into something else.

A space that shouldn’t exist.

They suited up and went to check.

⸻

Kael led. Rosie and Yu flanked him. Langley stayed back to monitor vitals. Keller begged to come but was denied.

Deck G was cold. The temperature sensors were off by four degrees—colder than it should’ve been, like the walls were breathing in.

They found the wall. Seamless. Clean. Like it had always been there. But Rosie’s scanner showed the impossible—energy readings curling behind the false barrier like smoke trapped in crystal.

Kael pressed his hand against it.

Something responded.

Not physically. Psychically.

He felt a pull. Not like gravity. Like recognition. Like whatever was back there knew him now.

And then the wall flickered.

For a second.

Just one.

A thin band of reality tore open like wet paper—and Kael saw through.

Not far. Just enough.

Enough to see the chamber beyond.

A sphere floated there, humming. Not like the first one. This one was black. Not colorless. Not dark.

Black.

Like it was eating light.

Wrapped around it was a cage of symbols—twisting, shifting language that looked like it had been written by time itself. Pulsing with memory.

He couldn’t read it.

But he understood one thing:

It was a door.

And it had started to open.

⸻

They left in silence. Yu sealed the hall. Rosie filed a malfunction report that no one would ever read.

Langley turned off the triangle feed.

Keller prayed.

And Kael…

Kael sat in the dark and whispered a name he didn’t know he remembered.

“Vosh.”

And deep inside the hidden chamber, the black sphere pulsed once—

—and whispered back.

## Understanding your Commercial blender Needs

Before diving into specific models,it’s crucial to understand what constitutes a good commercial blender and identify your specific requirements. The ideal commercial blender varies considerably depending on the request and the demands of your business. A high-volume smoothie shop, for instance, will have dramatically different needs than a fine-dining restaurant using a blender primarily for pureeing sauces.

To make the right choice, consider these factors:

*   **Types of Operation:** Restaurant, Bar, Cafe, Catering, or Commercial kitchen.
*   **Intensity of use (High, medium, Low).**
*   **Types of products you're making (smoothies, Cocktails, Soups, Dressings, Purees).**
*   **Budget.**
*   **available Space.**
*   **Cleaning necessities.**
*   **Noise requirements.**
*   **Desired features (Pre-programmed settings, Variable speed, Timer).**

by thoughtfully assessing these aspects, you'll be better equipped to navigate the market and choose a commercial blender that perfectly aligns with your operational needs. This thoughtful consideration will help guide your ultimate decision to the best commercial blender for your establishment.

## Key Features to Look for in a Commercial Blender

When evaluating commercial blenders, several key features should be top of mind.These factors directly influence the performance, durability, and overall suitability of the blender for your specific application.

*   **Power and Motor:** A powerful motor is the heart of any good commercial blender. Look for models with at least 1.5 horsepower (HP) for demanding tasks like crushing ice and blending thick ingredients. The ""high power blender"" you choose greatly affects it's long term value.*   **Durability and Build Quality:** Commercial blenders endure rigorous use, so durability is essential. Look for models with stainless steel blades, robust housings, and durable containers made from materials like BPA-free Tritan. Remember, the ""heavy duty commercial blender"" will pay off in the long run with reduced maintenance and less equipment downtime.
*   **Container Size and Material:** The container size should match your volume requirements. Consider the material as well. Tritan is shatterproof and BPA-free, while stainless steel offers exceptional durability and is ideal for hot ingredients.
*   **Blade Design:** The blade design significantly impacts blending performance. Look for blades specifically designed for crushing ice, blending smoothies, or pureeing sauces, depending on your primary needs.
*   **Speed Settings and Controls:** Variable speed controls offer greater versatility and precision. Pre-programmed settings for common tasks (e.g., smoothies, ice crushing) can streamline operations and ensure consistent results. A ""variable speed blender"" gives precise control over the blending process.
*   **Noise Level:** Noise can be a meaningful concern, especially in cafes and bars. Consider ""noise reduction blender"" models with sound dampening enclosures or optimized motor designs to minimize disruption. The more you can control noise, the better it is indeed for employees and customers.
*   **Ease of Cleaning:** Easy cleaning is crucial for efficiency and hygiene. Look for blenders with removable parts and dishwasher-safe components. Some models feature self-cleaning cycles. The easier it is to clean, the faster you can re-use this part of your ""commercial kitchen equipment"".
*   **Warranty:** A comprehensive warranty is a testament to the manufacturer's confidence in their product. Look for models with warranties that cover both parts and labor for several years.
*   **Certifications:** Look for certifications such as NSF (National sanitation foundation) to ensure the blender meets strict hygiene and safety standards for commercial use.

It was an inexplicable feeling, one that ignited every cell in my body, something that only happens with you. I cannot explain it, but I’ve learned to embrace it.

I knew then that I needed to know you, to understand this connection, this… *us*. I cannot simply walk away from you. I’ve given this a great deal of thought, and there’s much more I haven’t yet said – but know this: I want this. I want *you*. I’ve been here all along – can you really not feel my presence?

It feels as though you keep pushing me away, not because you don’t care, but because facing the truth of your feelings seems too overwhelming or like you’re not worthy of them, or of me maybe? Again, I’m not a mind reader, so you leave me to assumptions, which are something I hate making, because they can be so very wrong. 

I understand the need for space, for time to sort through it all – and that’s okay. But when you retreat into silence, when you shut me out in anger and say nothing at all, it leaves me feeling as if I’m losing my mind. Yet, deep down, I know I am not delusional. I’ve seen the way you look at me, the way our souls intertwine. This cannot be one-sided.

The last thing I ever wanted was to make you feel uncomfortable or as though I were imposing my feelings upon you – that was never my intent. All I wanted was to be honest, to share my heart before more time slips away. I’ve been carrying these emotions for six months.

Do you want me to be angry? Is that what you expect from me? I know you’ve shared that trust doesn’t come easily for you, and that you’re shy. Perhaps you’re accustomed to chaos, to dramatic and unpredictable reactions from others – but that’s not who I am.

I don’t share my feelings publicly, and I’ve never done this before. Yet, I make this exception for you. Why? Because I can no longer contain these emotions, and I don’t know how else to reach you.

I’ve remained strong because I’ve had to – it’s the mask I’ve learned to wear. You have no idea what I’ve endured in my life, just as I cannot fully understand the depths of your own struggles. But I want to. I want to know you, to understand the weight you carry.

I’ve kept it all inside, partly because that’s what society expects, partly because I didn’t want to risk forming a trauma bond. But also, because I understand you are carrying something heavy. I sensed it the moment I first saw you, even though you’ve hidden it well. I know the depth of your struggle – though it’s different from mine, it is also the same. I know you don’t want to burden me, but I want you to know that I’m here, that I’m ready to stand with you. And I need you to stand with me, too.

But there’s something I must tell you that you may not want to hear: you are not the only one hurting. I understand why you didn’t confide in me sooner – it was too soon, and we weren’t that close. But I wanted to know. I wanted to help. I still do.

What I need now is clarity. A conversation – face to face, as I’ve been asking for, for months. There is so much I’ve longed to say, but I need to see your eyes. I can’t make assumptions about your letters, not knowing whether they are meant for me, for her, or someone else entirely. I’ve wondered countless times if you were writing to me, only to find something that contradicts it, sending me into confusion. I can’t live in this uncertainty. The changing usernames, the vague messages – all of it forces me to guess, and I am exhausted by it.

I think in facts, in logic. I don’t like assumptions, but when you leave me in silence, you force me to make them. I know you’re shy, that you’re unsure of what to say, and I understand that. But silence only fuels my overthinking. I can’t stop my mind from running through every possible scenario – just as I know you do the same.

So, I ask this of you:  Please, speak to me – reach out in whatever way feels right. Call me, text me, email me – directly. I would love nothing more than to see you, whether it’s for coffee, a walk, at my place, etc... Wherever it may be, I need to know your thoughts. I need to look into your eyes, for they, more than anything, will reveal what words cannot.",3,1744042758.0,Letters_Unsent,3,1.0,False

1jtp8jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/1jtp8jn/its_not_you_its_the_market_what_youre_seeing_is/,"It's not you, it's the market. What you're seeing is delusion in practice.","Right now, the American market is behaving beyond irrationality; it's behaving schizophrenically. 

The EU markets are down 5%. Asian markets by around 7%. Meanwhile, the Americans are looking to close their day being gently down by about 1.5% or so. American markets might even end lightly in the green by 0.01%. 

This price trend flies in the face of logic as the United States is actively decoupling itself from the global economy. The consequences of doing so are anything but good for the current economic ecosystem of the United States. The entire American supply chain is about to see dramatic price increases as self-inflicted tariffs take effect. The head of the US Federal Reserve just went on the record as of last week to say that tariffs are likely going to slow US economic growth, including cooling consumer spending. Meanwhile, the President via Truth Social announced a doubling of tariffs on his country's largest trading partner. 

Yet the American market is proving to be amazingly resilient to these self-inflicted wounds. In fact, as of this post, the American market is doing 2x better than the European market today, and more than 3x better than the Asian markets. 

If you can't make any sense of the ""why"" behind these numbers, neither can anyone else. 

By any measure, the US is looking down the barrel of a lot of very bad, very difficult, and very expensive problems, that will not be solved any time soon. At minimum, it has pushed away its closest trading partners and given the global community at-large good reason to be skeptical of any negotiation the US enters.  

It appears that retail investors--said another way, everyday-Joes with Robinhood on their phones--are flooding in to ""buy the dip"", which large firms gladly sell into. 

So, if you're watching the market today and are trying to enter into an options strategy based on macro conditions, the frustration you may be feeling isn't your fault. Or, rather, it's only your fault inasmuch as you decided to trade in these conditions. However, it is very evident that the market is in a state of hallucination. The rest of the world sees what's coming and is bracing for impact. Meanwhile, we're buying and selling based on rumors. 

Take a deep breath, go get another cup of coffee, and don't blame yourself for chops today. ",8,1744042701.0,smallstreetbets,3,0.79,False

1jtp7r0,https://www.reddit.com/r/rustylake/comments/1jtp7r0/how_was_your_experience_playing_it/,how was your experience playing it,"i bought all the games a while back and i just got to playing them in order, but i didnt plan on playing the past within. the white door shattered my little heart, as it felt really personal to my own break up. on one of the first dates with that person i asked them to play the past within with me, despite them not knowing anything about rusty lake.

now i really want to play it again to sort of relive the memories. i kinda already know its not the sort of thing you can do by yourself. i was thinking to do it while i just read the walkthrus but i feel like that would spoil the fun. 

so i just came here instead to ask about your experience playing it, your memories. the past is not dead, is not even past blah blah


my memory goes as follows:
it was a beautiful cold rainy november evening; we went on a sort of study date, but couldnt concentrate, didnt want to go home either; we just wanted to hang out. we went to this really noisy coffee shop, packed full of annoying high schoolers. as we sat down, it crossed my mind to ask if they would play this game and needless to say, they did, no questions asked. we were so into it, that the coffee shop almost went silent. it went by so quickly too. i remember it felt like we could read each others mind, though, i did have to take a peak once. i remember walking home thinking how weird it felt working so well with someone, as i actively avoid team work (because of how bad i am at it). its a really warm, security-inducing memory, despite literally playing a rusty lake game in what was basically a loud crowd.

We decided to meet up and go play some miniature golf and get coffee after.

After our game, the coffee place we went too was way too crowded, so SHE proposed we could get coffee at my place.

We had great conversations, we discussed what we want in life and in a relationship and everything fit perfectly. We even cuddled a bit on my sofa. 

She was very enthusiastic the whole time, laughed a lot and even asked to stay for a while longer cause she was having fun when I proposed to being her back home.

I was convinced that everything went perfectly.

The next day, she says she does not see this going anywhere even though I'm a very good man.

What the hell happened ? 😳 I'm honestly very surprised.",1,1744042589.0,dating_advice,17,1.0,False
