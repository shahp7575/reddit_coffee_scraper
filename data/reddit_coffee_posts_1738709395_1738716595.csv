But I find that certain things that happened within my lifetime my family remembers differently.

As a child, we always had only caffeine free soda, only herbal tea. Absolutely no coffee. I remember vividly having my N64 taken away for drinking Dr. Pepper (not knowing it had caffeine, because my family had always simplified it to coke). The church (and family as a result) could now care less about soda. As an adult, I mentioned in passing to my mother about how I'm glad my nieces can drink coke now-- she got extremely defensive and insisted neither she or the church had ever forbade caffeinated soda. When I brought up the specific event she insisted she doesn't remember that at all.

This has been happening with a lot of little things. She denies we participated in door knocking for Prop 8, saying that was a personal choice for members but we never did that and the church never directly instructed it. She insists I misremember a traumatic part of doing baptisms for the dead (getting nude in a large room of girls and showering with no curtains). Denies ever talking to me about polygamy in heaven. Something exceptionally crazy that goes beyond the mormon brainwashing, despite having two DNA tests proving that I have a different father than my siblings, she insists that the DNA tests are wrong. With the exception of the DNA thing, my grandparents, aunts and uncles all have the same habit, that the church never did something that happened to me within my lifetime.

Does anyone elses family do this? She is unsuccessful in making me doubt my experiences, but I am wondering if she is legitimately mentally ill or if this just is par for the course of mormon boomers.",1,1738716493.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

1ihxj9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1ihxj9l/loud_asf_roommate_not_working_for_me/,Loud asf roommate not working for me...,"\*pretty sure this doesn't belong in this sub but anyhow...

This is a horribly long vent but please give your input if you manage to get through any of this— I (20f) am in college and living in an apt with two friends (both 21f). I run into the regular issues/frustrations with both of them (which feels pretty usual for the friend-roommate dynamic), and try not to let this affect the roommate part of our friendship. But, my house has been way too loud for me to sleep and I’m losing my mind.

(My bg for context) So, I also have my own sleep problems. I’ve struggled with insomnia since childhood and still regularly have problems falling asleep. I’m a pretty busy full time student and work 4 days a week, and am really trying to maintain a better sleep schedule (I spent the past two years of college sleeping average 5 hours/night, completely burnt out and exhausted). I need to be awake from 5:30-7am pretty much every day, and aim to be asleep around 10-11pm. Both of my roommates are night owls who are regularly up and hanging out until 1-2, will continue to move around the house until 3-4, and sleep in from 11-2pm. They know about my fairly demanding schedule (I’m usually out of the house from 8-8) and my efforts to go to bed earlier so I can get the sleep I need. I’m used to running for as long as I can on very little sleep, and really want to prevent that from now on. Just to add— I live in what is technically the dining room, which is connected to the kitchen and living room. This means I have 3 sets of doors in my room, and little to no noise block from either room (or the hall). Both roommates know this.

(Roommates bg for context) One of my roommates in particular is very loud, and I’ve spoken with her in the past about it being a problem, mainly because of how inconsiderate she is of her noise (vacuuming/hammering things in the middle of the night, etc). She’s never worked, recently dropped out of school (for mental health reasons), tends to sleep quite a bit (regularly until 1/2pm), and has pretty intense sleep apnea. B/c of this, I am very considerate about how loud I am while she’s asleep, which can be at literally any time of day, since she is regularly tired and will take naps throughout the day as well. I’m also sympathetic to the fact that since she doesn’t need to adhere to any schedule, she’s free to spend time up as late as she pleases, and I’m not mad about that at all— I know we’re young and I don’t want to place any noise bans on the house or anything.

So, she has been exceptionally loud the past few weeks (since coming home from her parent’s house, where she was gone for about a month), and it’s really frustrating me. She’s vacuuming and putting away dishes in the middle of the night (keep in mind I can hear *every single sound* from the kitchen), or making food or literally clapping pots and pans together— I don’t know. She has had people over 4 nights in a row, which is totally fine, but they spend all their time in the living room talking and scream laughing at the tv, yelling in the hallway and just generally making noise until at least midnight. Not to mention, her steps are so heavy that she shakes the doors in my room when she goes through the hall, and will slam every available door, cabinet, or drawer. It’s driving me crazy.

I’ve taken all the steps I can on my end to be able to sleep: I take hydroxyzine, melatonin, and magnesium every night and I stopped drinking coffee in the afternoon (which has been torturous for me). I play brown noise fairly loudly on my speaker in my room, and play both brown noise and music through my AirPods while they’re turned on noise cancelling (I know this is dramatic, I’ve progressively added things because nothing was working). Even still, this is not enough to mitigate the noise to a point where I’m not bothered by the noises. Quite a bit of light leaks in through my doors, but that’s been okay, since I don’t expect them to walk around/hang out in the dark. I also don’t expect them to be in their rooms when I am; I’ve been totally fine with them hanging out wherever at any time.

So, my big issue here: I can’t sleep unless my roommate is in her room and done for the night, so I’m laying close-eyed in bed for 3-4 hours every night silently praying for my own death until she shuts up and goes in her room. It’s horrible, and I’m getting about 5 hours a night (to put it generously) because I still have to wake up at regular times. She knows I’m “sleeping,” knows I have problems falling asleep, and knows I have to be up early, and still will not just SHUT UP. Talking to her hasn’t really worked—though, I haven’t brought it up in a couple months and plan to talk with her later. I don’t want to move out, and I’m just beyond frustrated and stuck. I’ve been thinking about asking if she can be mindful of her volume after 11pm on weekdays (and to stop doing chores in the middle of the night), but I also know it’s annoying to be bossed around for having fun when there’s no real incentive for her to be quiet at that time.

Please if you got this far, tell me what I should do (and if I’m an asshole for asking her to be quiet during the week) or any comments/questions/suggestions for this thing.

  
\[dramatic\] TL;DR (that AI wrote b/c I don't feel like it): OP (20F) is a college student struggling with her sleep due to loud roommates (both 21F), particularly one who has no set schedule and is extremely noisy at night. Despite taking multiple measures to block out noise, OP still lies awake for hours, getting only about 5 hours of sleep a night. Prior conversations with the loud roommate haven’t helped much, and OP is hesitant to ask her to be mindful after 11pm on weekdays, fearing it might seem controlling. Looking for advice—would it be unreasonable to ask 21 y/o roommate for quiet during the week?",1,1738716377.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

Enter Kevin (not the real name), the self-appointed Coffee Sheriff. He set up a stakeout, hiding behind a stack of printer paper, armed with a stale donut for sustenance. At 8:59 AM, footsteps echoed. A shadow loomed. And there he was Jerry (not also the real name lol) from accounting, chugging the last of the pot straight from the carafe like a caffeinated Viking.

""Jerry!"" Kevin leapt out. ""We've caught you coffee-handed!""

Jerry wiped his mouth and sighed. ""Look, man… I need this. My twins wake up at 4 AM. I haven’t slept since 2019.""

Two years had passed since I met her, and I had never had a friendship like this before. She was 30, I was 31, and we seemed to orbit around each other in a way that felt too perfect to ignore. At first, I didn’t think much of it, but as the months unfolded, I began to notice how much we had in common—how we could finish each other’s sentences, how we both loved the same quiet coffee shops, the same rainy days. She made me laugh like no one else could, and for the first time in my life, I felt seen, really seen, by someone. The kind of seeing that made me feel less like a cliché and more like I mattered.

She was always there for me, not just in the big moments but in the quiet ones too, when I needed a friend the most. And I began to fall for her. Slowly at first, like a ripple spreading across calm water. Her kindness was a balm to my soul, a peace I didn’t know I needed, but had been craving for years.

For the longest time, I told myself I couldn’t fall for her. I couldn’t risk it. I’d promised myself I wouldn’t make a fool of myself again, that I wouldn’t let my heart be shattered. I had only loved once before, and it had ended in ways I couldn’t undo. But, of course, I fell. I fell because she made me feel something I hadn't in a long time: safe. She made me feel cherished, like my kindness wasn’t a weakness but something worth protecting.

By the time I gathered the courage to ask her out, Christmas Eve rolled around. The snow was falling outside, the world wrapped in a soft, white silence, and there I was, sitting on her couch, heart racing. I took a deep breath and asked, ""Do you want to start dating?""

Her response was… not what I expected. It wasn’t the rejection I feared, nor was it a resounding yes. It was something in between, something that left me confused but oddly hopeful. She said she swore it wasn’t about me, that I’d be “the one that got away” if she didn’t choose me, but that right now, with everything going on in her life, she wasn’t ready. She needed time to adjust. She didn’t want to lose what we had, and she assured me that nothing would change between us.

I nodded, holding her gaze, and said I understood. I promised her that no matter what, nothing would change. I wasn’t going anywhere.

In the days that followed, I thought about it. I played out different scenarios in my head, trying to figure out what it all meant. Three possibilities crossed my mind:

1. She was being honest, and maybe, just maybe, when she was ready, we’d be together.


2. She had once wanted to be with me but had found someone else in the time we’d spent as best friends, and now she was waiting to see if they would make a move.


3. She had always wanted us to be nothing more than friends, and all of those sweet words had been her way of making sure I didn’t leave because of how much she valued our friendship.



I wasn’t sure which one was true, and part of me didn’t want to know. I had to accept it, whatever it was. My heart ached, yes, but not in the way it once had. It wasn’t the kind of pain that made me want to run. It was a quiet, bittersweet understanding. I loved her more than I had ever loved anyone, and if that meant I’d never experience the kind of love she gave someone else, then I could live with it.

We still hung out every day. Nothing had changed on the surface. We still linked arms when we walked together, still shared our favorite shopping adventures, still watched the same movies late into the night. Nothing had changed—except the unspoken thing between us that I could never quite name.

And maybe that was okay.

Because I knew her. I knew that even if she fell in love with someone else, she wouldn’t let that change our bond. She wasn’t the type to let a relationship get in the way of a friendship. I’d seen it before. She’d walk away from anyone who tried to break what we had.

So, I stayed. Best friends. Even if I was the one who would always wonder what might have been.

But sometimes, in the quiet moments when I saw her smile at me, when she leaned her head against mine as we watched our favorite show, I thought maybe, just maybe, we were already living something beautiful. Something that didn’t need labels or definitions. Something that was, in its own way, perfect.

And I was okay with that.

I feel anxious and on edge constantly. Mainly because of interactions with others. 

It feels like everyone is super standoffish with me and secretly all hate me for no reason. People barely give me a chance and before it seems they've gotten to know me I'm being shut out of things. I never get invited anywhere. Even lunch or coffee. Even the people at work who do have lunch with me it feels like they only tolerate me and would rather I not be there. 

It feels like girls constantly think I'm hitting on them and treat me with a cold distance. I always get the same look if I ever try and interact with them, like I'm bothering them.

Even tonight I play volleyball and a former coworker was there. I tried saying hi and I got one word answers. I just walked away. It constantly feels people are trying to get away from me and I don't know why. I don't do anything that I can recognize that causes this. 

I don't feel like I've ever been allowed to have a normal life. I just want my tribe. Now after so many years alone, I am also standoffish with people as when they ask me my plans for the weekend I'm scared to tell them nothing because they'll think I'm a loser. Or I think they're trying to get something from me.

I've made some social faux pas' in the past years ago and now ir eels like there's a groupchat where everyone in the city knows me and talks shit about me and they're all in on it and I'm not. Once they meet me I feel like they all point and say there's that guy we all hate.

I am also unclear about my emotions or what I am feeling-if-which is another hindrance to this practice also aiding my confusion. But what I don't get is, how do I even approach clarity in my workings? Is it just meditation that does it? Faith? I inquire about faith because my sister has a lot of clarity and she says faith has helped her. If so I am cooked, faith is the one thing I sadly lack unless it is governed by hope

1ihxgl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommates/comments/1ihxgl8/advice_for_my_loud_roommatedealing_with_different/,Advice for my loud roommate/dealing with different schedules,"This is a horribly long vent but please give your input if you manage to get through any of this— I (20f) am in college and living in an apt with two friends (both 21f). I run into the regular issues/frustrations with both of them (which feels pretty usual for the friend-roommate dynamic), and try not to let this affect the roommate part of our friendship. But, my house has been way too loud for me to sleep and I’m losing my mind.

(My bg for context) So, I also have my own sleep problems. I’ve struggled with insomnia since childhood and still regularly have problems falling asleep. I’m a pretty busy full time student and work 4 days a week, and am really trying to maintain a better sleep schedule (I spent the past two years of college sleeping average 5 hours/night, completely burnt out and exhausted). I need to be awake from 5:30-7am pretty much every day, and aim to be asleep around 10-11pm. Both of my roommates are night owls who are regularly up and hanging out until 1-2, will continue to move around the house until 3-4, and sleep in from 11-2pm. They know about my fairly demanding schedule (I’m usually out of the house from 8-8) and my efforts to go to bed earlier so I can get the sleep I need. I’m used to running for as long as I can on very little sleep, and really want to prevent that from now on. Just to add— I live in what is technically the dining room, which is connected to the kitchen and living room. This means I have 3 sets of doors in my room, and little to no noise block from either room (or the hall). Both roommates know this.

(Roommates bg for context) One of my roommates in particular is very loud, and I’ve spoken with her in the past about it being a problem, mainly because of how inconsiderate she is of her noise (vacuuming/hammering things in the middle of the night, etc). She’s never worked, recently dropped out of school (for mental health reasons), tends to sleep quite a bit (regularly until 1/2pm), and has pretty intense sleep apnea. B/c of this, I am very considerate about how loud I am while she’s asleep, which can be at literally any time of day, since she is regularly tired and will take naps throughout the day as well. I’m also sympathetic to the fact that since she doesn’t need to adhere to any schedule, she’s free to spend time up as late as she pleases, and I’m not mad about that at all— I know we’re young and I don’t want to place any noise bans on the house or anything.

So, she has been exceptionally loud the past few weeks (since coming home from her parent’s house, where she was gone for about a month), and it’s really frustrating me. She’s vacuuming and putting away dishes in the middle of the night (keep in mind I can hear *every single sound* from the kitchen), or making food or literally clapping pots and pans together— I don’t know. She has had people over 4 nights in a row, which is totally fine, but they spend all their time in the living room talking and scream laughing at the tv, yelling in the hallway and just generally making noise until at least midnight. Not to mention, her steps are so heavy that she shakes the doors in my room when she goes through the hall, and will slam every available door, cabinet, or drawer. It’s driving me crazy.

I’ve taken all the steps I can on my end to be able to sleep: I take hydroxyzine, melatonin, and magnesium every night and I stopped drinking coffee in the afternoon (which has been torturous for me). I play brown noise fairly loudly on my speaker in my room, and play both brown noise and music through my AirPods while they’re turned on noise cancelling (I know this is dramatic, I’ve progressively added things because nothing was working). Even still, this is not enough to mitigate the noise to a point where I’m not bothered by the noises. Quite a bit of light leaks in through my doors, but that’s been okay, since I don’t expect them to walk around/hang out in the dark. I also don’t expect them to be in their rooms when I am; I’ve been totally fine with them hanging out wherever at any time.

So, my big issue here: I can’t sleep unless my roommate is in her room and done for the night, so I’m laying close-eyed in bed for 3-4 hours every night silently praying for my own death until she shuts up and goes in her room. It’s horrible, and I’m getting about 5 hours a night (to put it generously) because I still have to wake up at regular times. She knows I’m “sleeping,” knows I have problems falling asleep, and knows I have to be up early, and still will not just SHUT UP. Talking to her hasn’t really worked—though, I haven’t brought it up in a couple months and plan to talk with her later. I don’t want to move out, and I’m just beyond frustrated and stuck. I’ve been thinking about asking if she can be mindful of her volume after 11pm on weekdays (and to stop doing chores in the middle of the night), but I also know it’s annoying to be bossed around for having fun when there’s no real incentive for her to be quiet at that time.

Please if you got this far, tell me what I should do (and if I’m an asshole for asking her to be quiet during the week) or any comments/questions/suggestions for this thing.

  
\[dramatic\] TL;DR (that AI wrote b/c I don't feel like it): OP (20F) is a college student struggling with her sleep due to loud roommates (both 21F), particularly one who has no set schedule and is extremely noisy at night. Despite taking multiple measures to block out noise, OP still lies awake for hours, getting only about 5 hours of sleep a night. Prior conversations with the loud roommate haven’t helped much, and OP is hesitant to ask her to be mindful after 11pm on weekdays, fearing it might seem controlling. Looking for advice—would it be unreasonable to ask 21 y/o roommate for quiet during the week?",1,1738716163.0,roommates,0,1.0,False

Hi there!

I think exchanging with someone you will likely never meet in person can push us to be the most authentic form of self and  there is something beautiful about that. 

I’m looking for a penpal who values deep, meaningful connections—someone who enjoys thoughtful conversations that unfold over time.  I’d love to share stories, ideas, and reflections on anything and everything, whether it’s books, life, deep conversation or the little things that make us who we are.

A little about me:

	•	I’m 30 years old, married, cat lady.  Call me a romantic, I did marry my bestfriend and love our cat like a human child.

	•	I recently learn I have ADHD and my life make more sense now! 💃🏻

	•	I’m fiercely loyal, I have a close group of friend some I know for the past 19 years. 

	•	I love vintage clothing and furnitures.

	•	Books are a huge part of my life! I love reading but my group of friend are non-reader so I would love to discuss and exchange recommendations. I love every genre but Some of my favorite books and series include The Passage series, Percy Jackson series, Before the Coffee Gets Cold, Saga (bd) and The Nightingale. 

	•	I’m introspective and curious, enjoying both deep, philosophical conversations and fun, lighthearted chats.

	•	I love anime and would be happy to talk about favorite series, recommendations.

I’d like to start by exchanging emails to see if we’re a good fit, and if we really click, I’d love to transition to handwritten letters. 

If you think we would be a good fit send me a message with a bit about yourself 🤓

Looking forward to connecting!

Some details: we don't get along, mainly because they don't know how to be decent human beings. After my first baby was born they visited for 4-5 days 10 days after birth and they did nothing to help out and instead contributed to our load as new parents. Dirty dishes were left at the table where they sat and ate, we cooked all meals; they did pick up take out we ordered one night. They stayed nearby (not with us) and showed up unannounced at least once during the visit, and would literally roll in in every morning asking what we had for them to eat for breakfast/ if there was any coffee. Other helpful background- both of them have brought illnesses to us during past baby visits- my SIL gave us a stomach virus by lying about it/hiding it from us and my MIL gave us the ""pandemic disease"" during a visit (she downplayed how sick she was, we told her to wear a mask which she agreed to but then caught her taking it off when we weren't around. Then when confronted she lied about that too.) So they're not trustworthy on the illness front.

Anywho if it were up to me I'd wait several months to have them around, but my good friend says that's unreasonable and says around week 3-4 is reasonable. If we did something that early I'd want to limit the visit to a couple hours. But if it were like 6 months out a couple days might be okay... I'd require masks either way I think but obviously that's harder with longer visits. I know my husband will feel pressured by them to see the baby ASAP but that's a side note.

MIL lives across the country (but is oh so willing to hop on a plane 8 times a year) and SIL is 2-3 hours away. Thank you for your input!!!",1,1738715452.0,BabyBumps,0,0.67,False

Why I Did This Challenge

I wanted to test a simple, high-protein diet to see how my body would respond. With all the noise around carnivore and keto diets, I figured, why not try one of the simplest versions: steak and eggs?

For 30 days, I ate only steak and eggs, twice a day between 1 PM and 6 PM, while fasting for 19 hours daily. The results? I lost 25 pounds and felt an insane boost in energy levels. Here’s my full experience.


The Rules of My Diet

Two meals per day (1 PM & 6 PM)

Each meal: 1 steak + 4 whole eggs

No snacks, no dairy, no veggies

Seasonings? Just salt and black pepper

Beverages? Only water and black coffee

Daily 19-hour fast (1 PM - 6 PM eating window)


The Results: 30 Days of Steak & Eggs

📉 Weight Loss

Starting weight: 205 lbs

Ending weight: 180 lbs

Total lost: 25 lbs in 30 days


⚡ Energy & Mental Clarity

The first few days were rough, but by week 2, I felt sharper, more focused, and had steady energy throughout the day.

No more afternoon crashes or sluggishness.


🍽️ Hunger & Cravings

The high fat and protein kept me full—no cravings for sugar or carbs.

Fasting for 19 hours daily became effortless.


💪 Strength & Performance

I didn’t lose muscle despite dropping 25 lbs.

My workouts felt stronger by week 3, likely due to improved fat adaptation.



Week-by-Week Breakdown

🗓️ Week 1: Adapting to No Carbs

Challenges: Headaches, low energy for 3-4 days (keto flu).

Wins: Meals were satisfying, and I wasn’t starving between them.


🗓️ Week 2: Energy Skyrockets

Energy went through the roof, no more sluggishness after meals.

Digestion improved, and my sleep got deeper.


🗓️ Week 3: Fat Burning Mode

Weight loss was steady (about 5-6 lbs per week).

Zero cravings, zero bloating, and clear mental focus.


🗓️ Week 4: Final Results & Thoughts

Hunger control was effortless.

My body felt leaner, and my clothes fit better.

I realized I didn’t need as much food as I thought.



Pros & Cons of the Steak & Eggs Diet

✅ Pros

✔ Simple & easy to follow – No meal prep stress.
✔ Fast weight loss – 25 lbs in 30 days.
✔ No cravings or hunger issues – High protein kept me full.
✔ Dramatic energy boost – No more crashes or sluggishness.

❌ Cons

❌ Expensive – Steak isn’t cheap!
❌ Repetitive – You must be okay with eating the same meal daily.
❌ Social eating is tough – Hard to go out and eat with friends.



Would I Do It Again?

Absolutely! This experiment taught me a lot about my body and what it actually needs. The simplicity of steak and eggs made meal planning effortless, and the energy boost was a game changer.

Would I stay on it forever? Maybe not, but I’d definitely use it as a tool for weight loss, energy, and discipline.



Final Thoughts & Advice

If you want to lose weight fast while keeping energy high, this diet works.

Be ready for keto flu in the first week, but push through.

If you’re considering it, give it 30 days—the results will surprise you.

Pattensburgh was a city of movement; airships emblazoned with corporate sigils cut through the air as great whales amble through the sea — slowly, hulkingly, filling the skies with a hundred different blimps cast in a thousand different colours. Beneath, motors rushed through the streets as blood rushes through a vein, quick and untamable and without mercy, each man at the wheel hoping to *go* somewhere, to *do* something. Honking and heaving and cursing were the music of the city, the sounds of traffic on Sixth and the animated billboards on Ninth, the *ram-ram-ram* of heavy trains chugging on their elevated tracks, running through arches within brick-and-mortar skyscrapers. 



On the sidewalk were thousands upon thousands of people, and from this vantage they all seemed as ants, each eager and going his own way, each unremarkable on its own, but coming together to found something entirely — at least, in Alirix's mind — beautiful. Men in top hats and sleek suits, women in pin-straight dresses and that curly short hair that was all the rage these days. Even centaurs and elves and lycan and all the other indigines, here in the largest city in the world, dressed in their human best. 



Street vendors were aplenty. There was an Elven woman selling fabulous gowns right there in the open, all strung on a line and glittering with gemstones. There was a group of fae boys blasting island music and frying up spicy, chewy *to'chali* in what could only be described as a grand *vat* of oil, selling them to passers-by wrapped up in newspapers — that doubtless had PRESIDENT NAMEH TO JOIN THE RACE? printed in bold atop them — wrapped up in bands of rubber. There was an old woman passing around trinkets and baubles and every time she raised an arm to call up a potential customer her arm flesh jiggled like loose dough. These vendors were aplenty, clogging up the sidewalk no less than the pedestrians were, and behind them were shops belonging to seamstresses and elite chefs and actors and whores who plied their craft in the open. This was Pattensburgh, after all — no talent went unexploited, nor any desire. 



Kane's Pyramid, the great apartment complex in which Alirix stood, rose at the end of the street. The building was, as its name implied, a pyramid, rising six hundred feet in the air, plated with gold, home to thieves and crooks and lowlives — that was to say, billionaires and CEOs and nepotism kings and queens. The Pyramid had been raised by the Halloway Hotel Chain, long before Alirix had been unfortunate enough to slide into the world. He supposed it would still be here long after he was fortunate enough to leave it. 



Alirix stood motionless before the glass wall, one hand in his pocket and the other adjusting the collar of his black trenchcoat. He watched box-shaped motors whizz through the street, watched the ads displayed on great billboards, colourless moving pictures against a colourful, moving world (this one was selling legal representation for golems), watched smiling vendors pocket crumpled denash bills, watched spindly whores stand before their establishments, pretending to sweat and swoon in the cold of an approaching winter, watched paper boys bounce through the streets holding bundles of bad news, fueled by an excitement only the youth seemed to have, watched the moon send silver rays down across the city, and lastly, watched the door within this wonderful apartment, waiting for it to open. 



The morphling Kazamoria sat across his shoulder like a scarf. Tonight she was a snake — one of the venemous kinds found in the deserts to the east — though this morning she had been a pigeon, and yesterday a horse. ""A *wild* horse,"" Kazamoria had insisted, though indeed there had been nothing wild about her biology. She had simply used that as an excuse to try her luck at kicking his teeth in with her hooves. Kazamoria Mon Moria did this often — tried her luck. 



Presently, she hissed. 



Kazamoria Mon Moria did not enjoy being kept waiting, though of course she was *not* being kept waiting — the man this penthouse belonged to was blisfully unaware of the fact of their forced entry, and certainly not of the maliciousness behind it, or of the fact they were in quite a time crunch. But Kazamoria did not care. It was a trait she shared with her fellow *tween*agers, as she liked to be referred to. She hissed again, and Alirix shook his head. Despite the fact she was a snake, and, not being a snake, Alirix could not understand her (understandably) on a simple, obvious level, he still felt he could gather the general grievance her hiss had been caused by. He could almost hear it in her voice. 



*I'm bored*. 



Alirix looked away from the glass wall and into the apartment. There were flowers and plants aplenty, each rarer and more obscure than the last. Warm, yellow lights from lamps forged into the shape of pentagons. There was a sunken pit in the floor lined with purple couches and red pillows, and in its center was a coffee table, upon which a book laid open: *Animal Urges in the War Against Men* by Phillipa Wu, one of those books wealthy men displayed to prove they had refined tastes. One wall was lined with books and trophies and taxidermied animal heads — eagles, deer, rhino, bears and one particularly unlucky lioness, missing both her eyes. On another wall as a mural of a vampire performing fellatio on a dragon. *A tad racist,* thought Alirix, moving on. There was a phonograph beneath the mural. Gold, just as everything else in this gaudy place. 



""Care for music?"" Alirix said. The snake on his neck hissed.



Alirix strode towards the phonograph. He felt the polished wood of it, set the record properly from the storage cabinet beside it and and placed the needle. A scratch, then a stream of music. Soulful, warm, smooth. Alirix found himself smiling ... until Kazamoria hissed. She did not appreciate the music. 



He sighed. 



And then the door opened. 



Alirix hoped his gaze remained impassive because in his head he was *screaming.*



The man was older than he had been last Alirix had seen him, and he looked it too. He now sat in a gilded wheelchair, pointy-eared, little more than saggy skin on thin, fragile seeming bones. His collarbone rose out of his sunken, sickly chest. His tawny complexion was blotchy and scarred with bumps and rashes. Before he had boasted a goatee and a head of slicked-back grey hair but now he was bald everywhere. He wore a green suit with a red tie, a square of patterned silk folded elegantly into his breast pocket. At his nimble, long fingers were rings of gold and emerald and diamond and pearl. 



The man was Emrys Yaurel. And he would die tonight.



If Emrys was surprised at the intrusion, he did not show it. Alirix as well remained silent, observing him as he wheeled himself over to a table and began taking off his jewels and rings. The music washed over Alirix, now tainted by the presence of this devil in designer. 



Kazamoria slithered around his neck and screeched, but Alirix himself said not a word. He was waiting, expecting. Emrys began to hum, then chuckle. He said something in Peoani Elvish, then stopped himself. He spoke next in Aldorian. ""Ha. Forgive me."" A clatter of a ring being set on a table. ""When last we spoke there were six of you."" Another ring. ""And then five."" A necklace, this time. ""And now two. Seems bounty hunters are dropping like flies."" 
Alirix balled his palms into fists. It was so strange to hear him speak. That powerful voice that had haunted his memories for a decade was long gone, left in its place a shadow of a shadow. Heat and fury festered within him as Emrys moved himself over to another table, where he poured red wine from a crystal decanter shaped like a heart. ""You'll forgive me. I'm not as swift as I once was. one for you. Your morphling is — well, what? Fourteen? thirteen? Far too young for a glass of something so strong. But you won't begrudge her a taste, I hope."" Emrys held the glass out with shaky hands, but Alirix knew the unsteadiness was not because he was afraid. In this old man's eyes was defiance. ""Come on, boy. I'll be very disappointed if you're still afraid of me."" 



Alirix had often prided himself as one not to be goaded, but goaded he was. He walked over to to him, reached out and grasped the cold glass from the dead man's fingers, then dumped its contents onto the plush fur rug beneath their fleet. 



""A waste,"" said Emrys Yaurel. 



""For you,"" Alirix spat, setting the glass down to the sound of a hissing Kazamoria. ""Do you think I'm an idiot?"" 



Emrys shrugged. ""I do not know you well enough to make a judgement on the matter. But I had hoped you were, certainly."" He looked out at the living room with those beady, leaf green eyes of his. ""How will you do it, then, Alirix Bavor?"" 



Alirix could have smiled. *So he knows why I'm here.* But then again, of course he did. What else could his presence here possibly mean, after all these years? Emrys Yaurel was a murderer and a blackguard, but he was not a fool. Alirix and his former team had learned this the difficult way. 



Still, Alirix supposed he had no issue playing with his food. Time crunch be damned. Eugene Skasgard be damned. ""Do what?"" he asked, moving away from Emrys's side and climbing down into the sunken pit of couches. He fell into one, cushions soft as clouds and cold as ice, and crossed one foot over the other. 
""The obvious,"" Emrys said. ""Will there be pain?"" 



Alirix cocked his head ever so slightly. ""Do you think you've found yourself in a position where there won't be?"" 



""No."" Emrys rolled himself towards the phonograph. ""I quite like this. You have good taste, boy. I'll give you that."" 



*Boy*. That word grated at him like nails on a chalkboard. ""It's yours. The record.""  



""I have good taste as well, but I already knew that."" Emrys raised the needle and the song faded away. He faced Alirix with a look of mock confusion. ""Where are the others?"" 



Alirix went momentarily stiff. ""Not here,"" he said. 



""One would think they would be, no? A big moment, this is. Giving your terrible villain the kiss of death."" 



""It won't be so pleasurable as a kiss."" Now Alirix was the one hissing. 



""I figured that."" 



""I'm happy for you."" 



""I wish I could say the same to you. Shame your colleagues have defected. I did like the red haired one, whatever her name was. She was fun."" 



Rest and relaxation time over, Alirix stood, opened the leather bag slung across his shoulders. He plucked the eyeless lioness, yellow and dusty, from the wall and (gently) placed it inside. 



""For Eugene?"" Emrys asked, then laughed. The sound was alien to Alirix's ears. ""He always was a cunt, wasn't he?"" 



""I wouldn't know,"" Alirix said, zipping up the bag. He reached into one of the many pockets hidden within his coat and unveiled his amplifier. It was a long, thin, simple stick of metal. Some called it a *wand.* Within it was a divinium crystal that powered it, giving himself and people like him — mages — access to spells. Unlike government issued amplifiers, however, this jailbroken wand was loaded with a deep well of illegal spells, including ...




""Say it,"" Emrys muttered, glaring up at him, eyes wobbling within their sockets. ""Say it and point the damn thing at my head. That'd be poetic. Symmetrical."" 



Kazamoria snapped her great jaws. 



""You approve?"" Alirix said to Yaurel, ignoring the annoyance on his shoulder. 



Emrys spread his arms then let them fall at his side. ""Well. I can't exactly say that I do."" 



For a time Alirix could only stare at him. This all was just starting to become real. He was *here*. He was with *him*. A moment he had fantasized about forever. He had dreamed of this on nights when he slept alone, staring at the ceiling. On days when he stood alone, in crowded trains and busy plazas. And here he was in the thick of it. 



Here he was about to take vengeance. 



He pointed the amplifier. 



""How many holes did you put in him?"" 



*In Neoh.*



Emrys faced the amplifier with protest wearing the skin of nonchalance. He would not give Alirix the grovelling he sought. Emrys raised his flabby chin. ""Ten, twelve, fifteen? Who could remember?"" 



""Twenty two,"" Alirix said. ""You shot him twenty two times. He was dead after the seventh."" 



""I'll take your word for it,"" Emrys said, then nodded at Kazamoria. ""How did you come about her? Wasn't here when last we met."" 



""Circus."" 




""And where did your friends go? You had all seemed so close."" 




""They're downstairs."" 




Emrys raised his sleeve to check the time on his gold plated watch. His great, sharp Elf ears wiggled. ""Lies smell of sulphur. I can hear doors closing in your voice."" 




""You're an old man,"" Alirix spat. ""You hear ghosts in the graveyard."" 



Emrys raised a finger. ""No. But I suspect I will soon."" 
Alirix's arm shook with unadulterated rage. He stepped closer, so close that the end of the amplifier was nearly kissing Emrys's pasty skin. ""I want you to *apologise*!"" he roared, a vein rising in his forehead. ""I want you to grovel and to beg!"" 




""And I want to live to see another sunrise,"" Emrys said, raising an eyebrow. ""Can't all get what we want, can we?"" Emrys smiled but then that smile transformed slowly to a snarl, and he roared back: ""*You* stole from *me*! You came into *my* house and took something of *mine*, and all I did was pay you back in kind!"" 



""What we took did *not* belong to you —"" 



Emrys turned and wheeled away, towards an adjoning room. ""Possession is often a frustratingly abstract concept —"" 



Alirix charged after him with the amplifier. ""You'll stay right where you are —!""


 
""Give me a moment, for fuck's sake!"" 



Emrys disappeared into the other room, then re-emerged a moment later with a box. It was an ornate box, wood painted purple with an emerald latch. It looked like something that had weight to it. Emrys was smiling again, his eyes calm yet heavy. ""I could not go to meet the gods without handing you our anniversary present. It is *the* day, is it not? Almost to the hour, in fact. You've a poet's soul, sir, but a monster's heart."" 



Alirix scowled and spread his arms mockingly. ""Look at the monster you made,"" he said before taking the box and setting it on the table. It made an audible thud when he set it down. ""What is it?"" 



""A present."" 



""Is it a bomb?"" 



""It's a present."" 



""Is it a *bomb*?""



""Why —"" Emrys sighed, ""*Why* would I keep a *bomb* in Kane's Pyramid, you fool?"" 



""Why would you keep poison in Kane's Pyramid?"" 



Emrys blinked, then shrugged. ""Fair enough. Open it."" 



Alirix, keeping the amplifier pointed at Emrys, flipped the latch with one hand and pulled open the lid with a *creak*. He was stunned to silence. Even Kazam did not hiss or snap or shriek. He stared at the contents of the box, eyes unblinking, skin reddening, arms shaking. He stared at the contents of the box, rage building, teeth clattering, mind racing. He stared at the contents of the box, enshrined, entombed, engulfed. In grief. 



It was Neoh. 



His head, in any case. Severed, battered, long preserved by enchantments. His blood had dried but his honey-brown eyes remained open, staring out at nothing, ten years too young. His skin was still tan and smooth, his hair still cropped down to his scalp, his nose still crooked from when he had smashed into a table in fourth year, his lips still thin and peeled and chapped, because despite all Delaney's pleading, he would never lower himself to wear chapstick. He was still *him*, and he would always be this way. Alirix was racked with an awful thought of dying as an old weary man, and thinking still of this head in a box, young and fresh and untouched. 



He closed the box. 



""Did you like it?"" Emrys asked. 



Alirix met him with silence. He faced him properly now. Pointed. 



""*Val Vaizimar*,"" Alirix said. 



A beam of red light burst from the tip of the amplifier, slamming against Emrys's chest with a force so strong Alirix heard his ribs crack and shatter. Red sparks of magical energy danced across his arms and legs and body as Emrys began to shake and convulse, eyes rolling into his head, spittle dripping from his mouth. The spittle quickly grew red, and then so did the tears falling from his eyes. Red hot blood leaked from every orifice Emrys Yaurel possessed. His ears, nose, eyes, mouth, asshole ... it came trickling out, then gushing out, painting his white dress shirt crimson, staining his blotched skin, pooling onto the seat of his golden wheelchair as he spasmed and cried and wheezed. 



Emrys Yaurel died painfully, but not alone. 



It took some time.

1ihx3qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1ihx3qx/after_6_years_am_i_the_ah/,"After 6 years, am I the AH?","Hi everyone, I will try to summarize this story as much as I can, but please know this comes from my heart as I don’t seem to forget or move on from this although around 6 years have passed. It all started in college, I met my best friend, Ana, who I loved as a sister. We studied the same major, so we spent a lot of time together. We even had the same group of friends. At that time, I was in a ‘serious’ relationship with John. At the beginning of it, everything was just fine, we kinda connected quickly and he was loving. But as time passed, he started to behave differently. He would emotionally abuse me almost every day. Around 6 months before our breakup, I had a tough time graduating from college as I had to increase my loans and also my mom was diagnosed with cancer. I could barely afford to take care of myself as most of my time was spent on taking care of my mom. Still, I managed to see him often. Usually, I would show up on sweat pants and a hoodie as I just wanted to be comfortable, but his comments towards my appearance started to hit harder. He once said that he wished we weren’t seen together because he wouldn’t want for people to think he had a horrendous girlfriend. That he started a relationship with someone pretty (I always did my hair and makeup, dress up to see him) and now I was just a fatty. I cried my eyes out that day. To add insult to injury, I still loved him. Anna was most of the time supportive, but I guess she couldn’t handle it anymore and started to push for a breakup. I was young and naive, nothing mattered as I always would remember the nice person he was at the beginning of our relationship. 2 weeks before my birthday, he broke up with me because he was no longer in love. He just sent me a text saying he had had a dream and that was it, he didn’t want to be with me anymore. I went to his house, a 3 yo relationship deserved better than a text. He said if he did that in person, he knew I would beg him and he would change his mind. He said we needed to go on separate ways. At this time, his mom arrived at his house and she comforted me, said his own son didn’t deserve a person like me, that I was too good for him and he has to learn that the bad way. I spent one or two weeks crying in my bedroom. It was not only my birthday week but also my mom’s first surgery, and I was alone. Without his support. I felt my world was falling apart. During this time, Ana tried her best to make me feel better. We would hang out and she would listen. However, she started to say ‘I told you so’ more often. She would highlight how small I was before him, as he would always end up getting what he wanted. She would emphasize how I wouldn’t listen to her advice and ended up doing what I wanted. That I didn’t cherished her friendship, even when she just wanted the best for me. She recommended to start going out again, and just look for crazy s-x to forget about everything. He was my first boyfriend, kiss, time, etc. Opening Tinder and getting in bed with someone I didn’t know didn’t seem like a good idea. It wasn’t something I would do. But she thought it could help. I gave it a try after a couple weeks, and I didn’t like it. It wasn’t for me. I was in the middle of, do I want to be alone or not? After 3 years, should I do something else instead? Focus on my career and my mom? I decided to try something different and enrolled in a cooking program she was taking. There I met some of her friends, and also met, Peter, who is now one of my best friends. Peter, Ana, Jake (one of her friends) and I started to hang out more often. I fell in love with our friendship. We would meet twice a month to spend time together. We’d ordered food, get some drinks, set up karaoke time, etc. I knew a bit about Jake, he tried to go out with Ana but she was in love with someone else at that time. I think they had dinner twice and then she told him she didn’t want to continue with their thing as she had feelings for someone else. She told me he kinda started to act weird and that most of their friends went his side. After months, they started to hang out again but just as friends. There was no kiss or anything else between them. And that’s when we created our group with Peter, Jake, Ana and I. So all that Ana and Jake thing happened like 3 years before we started our group friendship. At the time, I had this job that I hated but kept to pay my student loans. So, I would choose to drink when I could. Peter, Ana, and Jake would always try to cheer me up, but my job, mom’s situation, and my recent breakup would always make me feel like I needed to get alcohol to survive. Jake and I started to chat almost every day. He’d call to check on me and my mom. He even offered to loan me some money to quit my job. At first, I had no feelings, I saw him as I friend. But, things started to change, and we connected. I didn’t want to fell in love with him as I knew that something had happened between him and Ana. I knew she wouldn’t approve of.  So We kept our feelings in secret for around 2 months. Jake opened up my eyes. Everything with him was completely different from John, he would treat me right, support me, and I felt I didn’t deserve all his love and care. When we decided it was time to tell Ana and Peter, I started to feel anxious. I would call him crying, telling him I didn’t want Ana to be mad with me. That I knew this was against girl code and that it was better if we ended up things. But we would always realized that we felt something and it was strong, so it deserved a chance. We deserved a chance. We first told Peter, and he was so happy for us. He supported our relationship, even if it ended up badly, we deserved to find out ourselves, he said. I felt like I could gather some courage and tell Ana, so I invited her for coffee and told her, immediately she said ‘I feel like I’m gonna vomit, you disgust me’. I tried to tell her how much we cared about each other and that we didn’t want wished for all this to happen, it just did. I told her that if she wanted I could end up things with him, as her friendship was more valuable to me. But she said the damage was done. That she would never trust me again and I was the one who broke our group apart. That friends are not supposed to fall in love with each other and that I took her 3 years to be in good terms with Jake again and I screwed that for her. That she knew everything would happen again as it did with John and I wouldn’t listen to her so she’d end up hating Jake too. I think I never cried like I did that day. I felt like I had betrayed my sister and that things could not get amended. I was right, after 2 weeks of silence, she said she didn’t want to be friends anymore and just like that our 8 year friendship ended. I never felt so sad in my life, but I had Jake and Peter. Time passed and Jake and I built a strong relationship, we are now married and expecting our first child. He is such a great husband and I know he will be an awesome dad. He’s everything I had wished for. I love him truly, and I would choose him all over again every time. But there are some days where I feel alone, and where I miss Ana so much. After all that happened with her it has been very difficult for me to get new friends. So my friends circle is very limited. Jake is almost all that I have besides two or three male friends. Was I the AH the whole time? Should I have chosen her instead of him? Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if she had accepted our decision. I wish she was in my life, but somehow, sometimes I feel like we also were in some kind of abusive friendship as well. I still have her on social media, so I’m able to get some kind of updates on her life. Overall I feel happy for her. I still love her, and wish nothing but the best for her. We haven’t talked ever since, it’s been 6 years, and days like today I feel I wish I had her in my life. So, was I the AH?

When reflecting I think of all the bad things I did before having bad breath and how this contributed. Infrequent brushing, never flossing, horrible diet, ear infections as child, deviated septum that caused mouth breathing, pollen allergy that give allergic reactions to eating apples and carrots. My symptoms today are dry mouth, white coated tongue, post nasal drip, bad taste in mouth, smelly burps, stomach noises, phlegm that tastes sour and gas. 

My mom has always had stomach problems but never bad breath. Her issue is after stomach pain after eating gluten. Since going gluten free she is able to manage symptoms. I do not have pain after eating any food, but get horrible breath that is worsened by the usual suspects like milk coffee, sugar etc. My mom has apple cider vinegar pills she keeps on the kitchen table and I decided to have one. My bad breath instantly disappears  after having a pill. My mouth salivates and my mucus breaks up. I also am burping and releasing foul gas. 

Can anyone help me understand this? I have been on this sub since its inception and have spent years searching for solutions to my bad breath but have never gone all in on a low fodmap diet and prolonged my sufferings.

So just over a year ago I matched with a guy (24m) on Bumble. We hit it off straight away and started talking everyday. We met up for coffee a few months after we started talking and I felt in went really well! A few months later we met up again and it went really well.  Nothing “romantic” happened we were just getting to know each other, but I started to really like him. 
Then he disappeared for a while and I started to think he wasn’t interested anymore. I left it for about a month then plucked up the courage to message him. The message was just a simple “hi, hope you’re doing ok it’s been a while but I just want to say that I’m here if you need to talk…” etc. he replied a little while after explaining that he wasn’t doing too great mentally and physically which completely understood, and shortly after that things got back to normal. That being us talking everyday. 

Quite a while after our last meet up we saw each other again. This time at his house, we watched tv all day and just chilled out. Whilst we were watching tv though he started to playing with my hands, resting his legs on me and doing other things that I see as “flirting”. I asked my friends and they all agreed that it seemed like flirting to them too. I asked him about it and confessed my feelings to him and he said “there was definitely something there” but he “didn’t want a relationship because he he wouldn’t be a good partner right now” which again I understand but was a little frustrated as he was being flirty and maybe could have held back with that if he didn’t want me to think anything of it.

Since then I’ve been in a back and fourth with myself on whether or not he is interested in that way. He is a really good friend who really makes me laugh and I don’t want to lose that but I sometimes feel that the only way I can “get over him” is to cut contact as keeping talking to him is harming me mentally.

In May I'm doing a bike packing expedition from Austria to Italy over 12days. My longest bike packing trip has been 3days/2nights so far. 

I have some concerns that I am looking for advice on:

1. I'm looking for advice/recommendations on women's clothing to help stop the soreness from being in a saddle for that many days in a row. I've seen the chaffing cream, does this actually help anything? I don't usually struggle from chaffing, it's more just the actual sitting on the bike seat. 

2. I have around 100days until my trip and the people I'm going with are so much more fitter than me... they all race and are very very fit. I'm 5ft 7 (172cm) and 84kg. While my bike fitness is pretty good and I cycle around 120-150km every week, I struggle with hill climbs and I really need to improve before the expedition. Is there any tips to help me with this? My diet is pretty average: Black coffee = breakfast. Lunch = homemade soup and bit of baguette. Dinner = turkey or chicken steak with steamed veggies and couscous or quinoa. I usually snack on chocolate covered rice cakes and apples. My portion sizes are very large, but I struggle with food as I used to have problems surrounding it, so if I try to restrict myself it'll end up as a binge.

I'm just looking for help basically. What can I do to reach better bike fitness before the trip? I know I can't become a pro in 3months but I'd like to try my absolute best. I struggle with stress and sleep. My legs and mind are definitely my biggest assets but I'll be riding between 55km and 80km (most around 60km) everyday with elevations of around 2500m most days... and currently I do about 70km with at most 500m of elevation.

If anyone has any tips or can even draft me up some sort of exercise plan and nutritional plan, I'd be so grateful as I'm very lost. I don't know if I need more hours on the bike or if I need to do weight lifting, if so what kinds of these things??? I'm just completely lost and I want to make the best use of the next 3months as I can or I'll arrive into Austria defeated before I've begun.

Also if anyone else has any other tips please share!

*How does it work?*

You download the app **TasteTown** from Google Play or App Store, register and during the process use code **Q2NKPZ**. With this code you will get the first month for free and can access all the deals. Before going to the restaurant, you have to “Reserve the deal”. There is a limited number of deal activations per day per restaurant. You can also reserve the deal in advance, for up to 8 days ahead. Once you have the deal reserved, you go to the given restaurant and tell the staff which deal you have activated. Before paying you have to redeem the deal in front of the member of the staff. 

*What do I get from it?*

You will get access to hundreds of promo deals for various restaurants in Prague and Brno. The deals are of several types - e.g. 1+1 main dish, 1+1 coffee, coffee + free desert, 1+1 drink, 1 Kč main dish, etc. So basically you can save up to 50% (or more with 1 Kč deals), which can add up pretty quickly.

*How much does it cost?*

You will get the first month for free and after that you pay either 129 Kč (monthly subscription) or 97 Kč (annual subscription). 
You can also get 1 month for free for each friend you invite. You can cancel your subscription anytime. Usually, you save more with only one deal, so it is really a no-brainer.

*How many deals can I use?*

You can use unlimited amount od deals in the app, although each deal can only be used once every 30/40/60… days. Each deal has different terms.

So try it out for yourself and start saving while eating out!

In the New Testament, **Jesus expected** His followers to fast:

*“The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.” (Luke 5:35)*

After Christ ascended, the apostles fasted to seek God’s will—and when they received it, they obeyed. The early church fathers also practiced fasting, seeing it as a way to conquer sin. **Augustine wrote:**

*“Fasting cleanses the soul, raises the mind, **subjects one’s flesh to the spirit**.”*

This is true from my own experience. Fasting aligns with Paul’s discipline over his body: *“I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.” (1 Corinthians 9:27)*. While Paul may not have been speaking **only** of fasting, it makes sense that he used it as a means of spiritual discipline.

Yet today, **fasting has been watered down.** Many Christians practice **“soft fasting,”** giving up coffee, social media, or chocolate for a time. While sacrificing small comforts can be beneficial, it doesn’t compare to the kind of fasting that **transforms the soul and subdues the flesh.** The early Christians didn’t fast by only cutting out luxuries—they fasted by abstaining **completely** from food, sometimes for 16-72 hours, sometimes much longer.

If we are serious about being better disciples of Christ, we must take sin seriously and bring our bodies into submission. You’ll be surprised how little food you actually need—and how fasting exposes deeper habits and desires that need to be surrendered to God.

When I first tried teaching my students the Italian equivalent of ""can't help doing,"" their faces were a mix of confusion and curiosity. I felt like I was trying to explain how to juggle spaghetti! But, like a good pasta dish, the secret is in the sauce—or in this case, the expressions.

In Italian, you don't just slap *""aiutare""* onto a sentence. Instead, there are two handy expressions:

- *Non potere non*
- *Non potere fare a meno di*

Let me break it down with some real-life examples. Imagine you're at a party, and you see a delicious cake. You might say, *""Non posso non mangiare questa torta!""* which means, **I can’t help eating this cake!** It's like the cake is calling your name, right?

Or, picture this: every morning, you reach for your coffee. You could say, *""Non posso fare a meno di bere caffè la mattina.""* It means, **I can’t help drinking coffee in the morning.** Coffee is life, after all!

I'm a firefighter, so I'm fairly active while on the job and in my free time. Typically I eat anywhere from 1/3-1/2 of what my coworkers eat (especially when the food isn't the best options). Even compared to my wife who is about 130 lbs and 5'2, out eats me and we generally cook meals at home with hers having more veggies thrown in. That being said I don't lose ANYTHING. Over the past 6 months or so, my A1C and LDL are elevated above normal but none ""indicate that you have diabetes and are still reversible."" I explain my typical meals and my doctor scratches his head and has referred me to an endocrinologist and dropped that he thought I could be insulin resistant. If this is the case...what can I expect and what I can do to further improve my eating habits. I'm 220 lbs and 5'7, I am muscular but my fat of course all hangs in the gut. An example of my meals are:

Breakfast:
Overnight oats (the brand)
A protein nut bar-made of almonds.
Coffee and maybe a packet of sugar.

Lunch:
A turkey wrap or Caesar wrap, yogurt, ollipop. Sometimes a sandwich of some sort or if it's a crapshoot at work some form of frozen breaded chicken. 

Dinner:
Chicken or beef. At work it's likely to be a lean patty burger or grilled chicken sandwich. I typically use Dave's killer bread for my buns. Cottage cheese. If I have a coke for the day this will be when I do. If I'm in a pinch at work, again, it'll be a frozen food or a pizza ordered. 

Snacks typically consist of natures baker bars. No more than two of them a day but it's usually only one.

1ihweqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ihweqo/so_sick_of_shitty_ass_relatives/,So sick of shitty ass relatives,"I (f25) recently lost a dear family friend, we will call her Mary (f71), she was friend with my grandma first and she quickly became part of the family. She spent a lot of time with us, ever since before I was even born: holidays (Xmas, Easter, new year, birthdays etc), vacation, outings, we have a family owned beauty salon and she would come basically every day to have a coffee and chat.
She was like a literal grandma to me; she would give me tons of gifts, buy me lot of stuff (she basically bought all of my clothes ever since middle school), take me out for lunch and shopping, be there whenever I needed her. We would often hang out, she would hang out with my mom too, she would go with us (or just my mom) on vacation etc. She’d come pick me up from practice, she’d took me to the cinema or anywhere really, in middle school we’d hang out every Friday and when my grandma died we would visit my great grandmother every week, she taught me how to ride a bike… she was such an important and persistent presence in my life. 

It was a sudden death, just a couple of weeks after Xmas, it was harsh, no one was expecting it. 
Here’s where the “shitty relatives” come into play; she wasn’t very close to them, she actually spent years no contact with them, that’s why my family basically adopted her, and she kind of reconciled with them only 4/5 years ago after her niece died. 
The only relatives left are her SIL, her nephew and grandnephew. 
(SIL and nephew are Jehovah’s witnesses, it will be relevant later)

I went to Mary’s house to see her before they closed the casket to take her to the crematorium. 
While there I asked if I could take some stuff as a memory and asked them to tell me whenever I could come back to take more stuff (not expensive stuff ofc)
A week later they held the funeral, which wasn’t supposed to be a funeral, but more of a commemoration since she was atheist. 

Boy was I wrong. Once we arrived at the cemetery we found out they brought two Jehovah’s witnesses to say something. They probably told them a ton of lies since they spoke about what a “great relationship” she had with her nephew (she hated him), how she had her weekly coffee appointment with SIL (she was literally always with us the other 6 days of the week) and how she recently found god and faith??? 
They even added “she didn’t tell to a lot of people”, yes because it’s not true! I was cringing the whole time, so damn disrespectful. Not even a word for me or my mom. They didn’t even allow anyone to say anything else or even pay their respects before putting the urn in the niche. 

I waited two weeks and yesterday I texted Mary’s SIL to ask when could I come and get other things from Mary’s house. She said she didn’t have the keys anymore because someone stole them and that “the boys” have the keys and they won’t let anyone enter. I asked to speak to grandnephew and she said he doesn’t want to give his number out. 
So I texted nephew, I asked the same thing and he said the apartment had already been emptied and everything donated. 
I wrote a snarky reply saying “what can I say, thanks for letting me know. After this and that little scene at the funeral I now understand why Mary felt that way about you”, hinting at her actually hating him. 
My mom got really angry and sent a text to SIL as well to let her know how shitty were. 

Here’s the best part: after that grand nephew gf (let’s call her Jane) calls my mom, she says SIL promptly called her to tell her what happened with us and not to say anything (Jane said SIL was afraid of us randomly bump into each other and them talking bad about her). So she told us everything: they stolen keys, a lie (obviously), the apartment is indeed empty because nephew came in first to take what he could (probably the only expensive things Mary’s had) and then donated everything without leaving nothing to grandnephew. 
They put the house on sale, without saying anything to grandnephew. 
Also grandnephew has not been talking to them since the funeral because he is mad about the religious ceremony and all the stuff they said (he actually left during the function). Jane also tells her that Mary left 1000€ to pay for her funeral, but instead they used these money to have the lamps from Mary’s parents and grandpa removed from their gravestone (apparently that’s forbidden for JW). 

So that’s it, I feel so disgusted and angry that they had to ruin her memory and disrespect her like this I almost feel sick to the stomach. ",2,1738713207.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

I really don't want to do that, and much rather explore MM methods for healing gum recession and enamel. My teeth are partly translucent at the tips - could be from years grinding, excess vinegar, coffee, too many nuts.  

I recently came across a dentist (Dr. Ellie Phillips) whose healing protocol for gum recession avoids hydrogyn peroxide, citrus unless eaten with foods, chewing on kale and spinach because of oxalic adic. Of course, I'm extremely skeptical of this since I've listened to MM a fair bit on this topic. He's mentioend that chewing on kales is very good for oral health and that oranges help regrow teeth. However, some things she says don't seem to conflict with MM like using a Xylitol rise after eating.

I'm just trying to do the right things, but so difficult with conflicting info between all the misinformation out there and what my dentist is saying. 

Has anyone had success regrowing gums? ON AW's last talk on oral heath I think a week ago, he said propolis rinsing can regrow gums, which I've started doing. and also rinsing with celery juice. I have an Invisalign retainer, brush twice per day, water floss and regular floss, cycle between three toothpastes, use essential oxygen rinse a couple types a day, and tongue scrape in the morning. Also trying to rinse with water after eating, but could be more consistent with that.

As the title says, I am looking for a casual chat partner to make my days stress-free. Who doesn't want a bit of dopamine in the day? It's easier said than done, to be honest, but if you are here, hopefully, we will connect.

I am 39, a working professional who landed on Reddit by chance and just got hooked on it, as most of us do, due to wonderful communities and subs. I am married and father to a wonderful daughter whom I love to the moon and back.

So, what am I seeking here? That's a good question, and to be honest, I am just trying to explore and discover myself. Yes, at this age, I am. I have been working rigorously for the last 15 years nonstop and have given my all to my family and running finances, but in the last couple of years it has been a landslide spiral down in my personal space, so I decided that I should pay a bit of attention to discovering outside my monotonous life.

Please do not judge me. I love my family to the core, but this whole thing is about me, and I don't want to give an explanation about it to anyone else; perhaps someone in my situation will understand my point of view.

I am a shy and introverted personality with a minimum social circle. I am an exceptionally good listener and I never judge. A kind heart who always prioritizes smiles on others rather on self - as my near ones say. I give off nerd vibes - so love technology and gadgets, and I watch a lot of sci-fi. Space movies intrigue me a lot and mix that with Dragonball anime - you know how I am.

1ihwbu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ihwbu7/aita_for_finally_living_for_myself/,AITA for finally living for myself?,"Hi, I’ve posted this in another forum but wanted more opinions.

I (25F) live with her mom (61F) and younger brother (23M, autistic). Recently, I’ve been living what I call “my version of life”, rather than what has been expected of me my entire life.

Rather than working full-time (sometimes overtime) week after week, being at home to be there in case my family needs something from me, take educational courses (certifications, degrees, etc.) for things that I wasn’t sure I wanted to pursue, sitting and waiting for the approval of my mom, I’ve been at home less, going out more with my first ever boyfriend (one who I love, but my mom doesn’t approve of), seeing more of the world, expanding my social circles, learning more things.

Recently, I’ve finally told my mom that while I love my family, I needed to live for myself. I have worked full-time hours while being my younger brother’s caregiver when my mom couldn’t, took care of finances when needed, put my life on a semi-hold for the sake of my family. I explained to her that while they may see my efforts and actions as something guaranteed and normal, I felt like it was now time for me to “leave the nest” like how my older sister did. 

She then asked me the following:
- “Did you suffer while living with your little brother and I? I don’t think you did since we left you alone.”
- “Are you just leaving us now?”
- “Do you not understand that we only have a home because of your income and how you leaving will affect us?”
- “Are you gonna at least do what I asked you to do (pursue Nursing, date the men that she approved of, etc.)?”
- “Who’s gonna take care of things when I have to go?”

Sitting there next to her, I answered each one of her questions:
- “I wouldn’t say suffer, but we argued a lot about things that I don’t think we should’ve even had to argue about (curfew, where I went, who I went out with, etc.) and that made me realize that it was time for me to struggle and live on my own. And I am hoping that you guys have prepared to live independently from me like we agreed before signing this lease.” [Context: Last year, I told my mom that I was going to live on my own. But she asked me to help them one more year by splitting rent so that they can get a solid footing for their own place.]
-  “Yes, I am. I’m getting my own place for my privacy and independence, but that does not mean that I’m abandoning you guys and hoping for the best.”
- “Yes, I understand that my income was what helped us get this apartment and give us a roof over our heads. But we agreed beforehand that after this lease, we should have the ability to live on our own since we’re splitting the rent.”
- “No, I am not going to pursue the things that you’d like for me to. I will definitely keep them in mind, but I’m not in a good financial or mental state to be pursuing a degree, listen to your every word about every aspect of my life, etc. As an adult, I’m here to live out my life the way I see fit, not how you want it to be. [Context: I’ve pushed back on this a few times and once asked why she was only pressuring me in this way. Her answer? “I basically live through you. I know what’s best for you because I’ve been through it all. You’re also our last hope of what we consider a successful child; if you fail me, I’ll just kill myself - there would be no reason for me to live. Don’t disappoint me because then there’s nothing left for me.”]
- “As we agreed, I am willing to HELP out. BUT, older sister (26F) needs to help as well since she wants to be a part of the family more and help out. I can no longer handle everything on my own and want to live my own life the way I’ve always wanted.” [Context: Older sister and mom have a rough relationship, but they have gotten better. She was the hope of the family, but now has become… her own person? My mom does not approve of almost anything that she does (i.e. boyfriend, living situation, financial situation, habits, health, etc.), but I do tell her to learn to accept and voice her opinion when appropriate if she wanted to maintain the somewhat fixed mother-daughter relationship that they have now. So her way of dealing with her dissatisfactions regarding my sister? Make remarks, evaluate, and get upset. All I tell her is that if her adult daughter is happy the way she is and found a way of life, why is she trying to change something that doesn’t want to be changed? And this is a constant cycle, so there is some distance between the two. My sister also just never helped out due to her past and has now opted to help through words and suggestions.]

The conversation seemed to have gone relatively fine, and we have made our plans and searched for our new apartments. Despite me thinking that we were on the same page, recently, she told me to move into certain apartments that she sent me since they were close to where she and my brother were moving to. I have NEVER disclosed where exactly I was moving. So, when I asked why she was TELLING me to move to these apartments, she said, “You have to move here so that you can take ca— I mean, support your brother.” I stood there and told her, “I’ll be in the same city and was willing to HELP, but I will not be his caregiver when my brother had the resources and ability to support himself (he has done it before for a few months).” I then left and there was a sense of uncertainty and tension in the air since.

As of late, again, I have been going out a lot more rather than staying at home (a 180° from my depressive, sleep all day, stay-at-home past). I have asked every now and then to my mom and brother if they wanted to go out (get boba, coffee, pastries, etc.) or hang out, and that is usually answered with a “No” or “Maybe next time”. I went on a road trip with my boyfriend (4 hours away to his hometown) recently and was met with anger, disgust, and disappointment from my mom. 

I mentioned to them before leaving that I am going on a trip from Friday to Sunday, and I will be back Sunday might. I wasn’t scolded, I wasn’t questioned, nothing happened then. But when I texted in our family group chat if they wanted anything from a well known gas station, I was then questioned and yelled at by my mom for the following things:
- “Am I really traveling with that little boy?” [Context: The “little boy” is my first ever boyfriend who is 3 years younger than me. She liked him at first, but when he and I became more serious, she went off the deep end and began disapproving and scolding me about it every chance she gets since SHE doesn’t approve. I have told her that this was my life and while I can hear her out, this was ultimately my choice to be in this relationship and she can either take it or we can deal with it another way.]
- “You have never cared for another adult in your life, but you want to care for the ones in his life? This isn’t even funny.” 
- “You have never cared for your grandparents unless I forced you to, but you easily care for the one that you’ve never met?” [Context: My paternal grandparents are both deceased and were incredibly abusive to my family. May they rest in peace, but I have no particular feelings or fond memories of them. And my maternal grandparents live on the other side of the world and did not try to reach out or maintain contact. While I do love them, we haven’t maintained a relationship even though I’ve tried through daily messages, calling attempts (time zone differences and their erratic schedules), and more.]
- “Since I don’t say anything to you, you think you’re on top of the world and think you can do whatever you want, huh???!”

Shocked by her response, but not surprised since she goes off like this every now and then, I told her that I was going down to his hometown to go to a fest that’s happening, to try out new foods, to see his dogs, and to sightsee; not once did I say that I was going to care for his grandma, his parents, or his family. I continued to say that she needed to calm down because I am NOT doing anything illegal, I am an ADULT, and I am not acting self-important by doing what a normal adult does - travel for a quick weekend getaway.

We then went radio silent on each other, and I’ve just been getting more and more anxious for the move-out date. I know that moving out will allow me to have independence, but I’m worried about my future.

I have spoken to my boyfriend about this since we do have plans to commit when the time is right. But since this incident with my mom, I’ve realized that I essentially have a lot of issues that have been pushed deep down and no support from my family in any way, and this has affected both him and I. I have been having breakdowns, consistent moments of anxiety and dread, and a strong sense of guilt.

Neither one of us expected to be in a situation where we would have parents who didn’t approve of our relationship, and I’m scared that I’m wasting his time and not the right one for him. I doubt myself as a person and as a partner to him; there are times where I wonder if I was gone, would he be happier? Would my family be in a better state? Would everybody be happier? Would I then be at peace, finally?

I am thinking of going to therapy, but money is just very tight due to me moving out soon and some other financial responsibilities. I have been doing introspections, self-affirmations, communicating with my boyfriend, but I’m stuck. I feel like I’m doing what I can, but I feel myself sinking and becoming like a sludge (?). He and I have spoken about the possibility of our relationship not working, but we’re pushing through it to see if we can get past this hurdle. But is this a hurdle or an immovable barrier that we’re pushing against? 

I also don’t know if I’m handling the stuff with my mom and family the right way? Should I just go no-contact after moving out? Should I keep low-contact and help every now and then? Do I keep trying to help my mom understand? Do I ask my older sister to just support me the way that I have been for years? Or am I just being selfish and not thinking of family when we’re all we’ve had for years.

All of these things have made me think of a few things, like “Am I being selfish by not breaking it off? Am I being stupid? Am I over-thinking? Am I just anxious?”

I don’t know. I’m scared. I’m anxious. I’m crying every other hour. I’m feeling guilt.

1ihw9q5,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1ihw9q5/post_final_interview/,Post Final Interview,"Hi friends! 

I finished a series of two interviews at a local university and wanted to ask your thoughts on a few things. 

Intro wise, I have a higher ed background, along with strong social media management and marketing, and have a mid level role that does senior level work (I oversee all aspects of student life for a grad school, for example, while balancing administrative tasks and support for a director).

I interviewed for a role last week at said local university and felt like I got along well with the creator of the initiative; I then got invited to an on-site, final interview with three folks that I believe also went well. They asked a lot of specific follow up questions to really get an idea of what I work on, and at the end, one commented that they felt that I would be a good fit for the role since I’m capable of balancing a lot of projects at once.

The initiative manager came in after and asked if I wanted to get coffee, which was fairly briefly, but went decently? I was really anxious, I’d say. She asked if I’d feel comfortable doing the commute, and I mentioned I’d been on campus before: I interviewed for a coordinator role before, and was pre-offer. They’d said I was their top candidate, and wanted to do their reference checks. At this university, reference checks can only be done for the candidate you want to give the role to, and after that I believe is the offer. However, when anxious, I’d referred to it as an offer rather than pre-offer.

I’m on good terms with the team that extended the pre-offer and have them on LinkedIn. The initiative manager asked why I turned it down, and I mentioned it would take me away from interacting with students, which I consider to be the part of my role that I love most. She said this role wouldn’t keep me from that, and asked who I interviewed with: one of them is a good friend of hers.

I asked about next steps, and was told they would wrap up next week, and that this is the last round. After this, they’ll be making decisions and then reaching out, but wouldn’t leave me in the dark.

This was two Fridays ago, and last Friday I reached out to their team, and was told they would only reach out if I made the next round of interviews. I’m slightly confused, because the initiative manager said that was the last interview, and also that they would reach out with the news wether it be good or bad.

Two questions: could it be possibly my anxiety induced verbiage blunder can result in me not receiving the role? And could it be possible that I’ll still hear back by the end of this week if I got the role or not?

1ihw8lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1ihw8lk/so_sick_of_shitty_ass_relatives/,So sick of shitty ass relatives,"I (f25) recently lost a dear family friend, we will call her Mary (f71), she was friend with my grandma first and she quickly became part of the family. She spent a lot of time with us, ever since before I was even born: holidays (Xmas, Easter, new year, birthdays etc), vacation, outings, we have a family owned beauty salon and she would come basically every day to have a coffee and chat.
She was like a literal grandma to me; she would give me tons of gifts, buy me lot of stuff (she basically bought all of my clothes ever since middle school), take me out for lunch and shopping, be there whenever I needed her. We would often hang out, she would hang out with my mom too, she would go with us (or just my mom) on vacation etc. She’d come pick me up from practice, she’d took me to the cinema or anywhere really, in middle school we’d hang out every Friday and when my grandma died we would visit my great grandmother every week, she taught me how to ride a bike… she was such an important and persistent presence in my life. 

It was a sudden death, just a couple of weeks after Xmas, it was harsh, no one was expecting it. 
Here’s where the “shitty relatives” come into play; she wasn’t very close to them, she actually spent years no contact with them, that’s why my family basically adopted her, and she kind of reconciled with them only 4/5 years ago after her niece died. 
The only relatives left are her SIL, her nephew and grandnephew. 
(SIL and nephew are Jehovah’s witnesses, it will be relevant later)

I went to Mary’s house to see her before they closed the casket to take her to the crematorium. 
While there I asked if I could take some stuff as a memory and asked them to tell me whenever I could come back to take more stuff (not expensive stuff ofc)
A week later they held the funeral, which wasn’t supposed to be a funeral, but more of a commemoration since she was atheist. 

Boy was I wrong. Once we arrived at the cemetery we found out they brought two Jehovah’s witnesses to say something. They probably told them a ton of lies since they spoke about what a “great relationship” she had with her nephew (she hated him), how she had her weekly coffee appointment with SIL (she was literally always with us the other 6 days of the week) and how she recently found god and faith??? 
They even added “she didn’t tell to a lot of people”, yes because it’s not true! I was cringing the whole time, so damn disrespectful. Not even a word for me or my mom. They didn’t even allow anyone to say anything else or even pay their respects before putting the urn in the niche. 

I waited two weeks and yesterday I texted Mary’s SIL to ask when could I come and get other things from Mary’s house. She said she didn’t have the keys anymore because someone stole them and that “the boys” have the keys and they won’t let anyone enter. I asked to speak to grandnephew and she said he doesn’t want to give his number out. 
So I texted nephew, I asked the same thing and he said the apartment had already been emptied and everything donated. 
I wrote a snarky reply saying “what can I say, thanks for letting me know. After this and that little scene at the funeral I now understand why Mary felt that way about you”, hinting at her actually hating him. 
My mom got really angry and sent a text to SIL as well to let her know how shitty were. 

Here’s the best part: after that grand nephew gf (let’s call her Jane) calls my mom, she says SIL promptly called her to tell her what happened with us and not to say anything (Jane said SIL was afraid of us randomly bump into each other and them talking bad about her). So she told us everything: they stolen keys, a lie (obviously), the apartment is indeed empty because nephew came in first to take what he could (probably the only expensive things Mary’s had) and then donated everything without leaving nothing to grandnephew. 
They put the house on sale, without saying anything to grandnephew. 
Also grandnephew has not been talking to them since the funeral because he is mad about the religious ceremony and all the stuff they said (he actually left during the function). Jane also tells her that Mary left 1000€ to pay for her funeral, but instead they used these money to have the lamps from Mary’s parents and grandpa removed from their gravestone (apparently that’s forbidden for JW). 

So that’s it, I feel so disgusted and angry that they had to ruin her memory and disrespect her like this I almost feel sick to the stomach. ",2,1738712732.0,rant,0,1.0,False

**The shipping calculator just simply works when I you refresh the page.** I use different payment methods, and some allow people to check out on the cart -- directing to paypal and the like, instead of my internal checkout system. I know some people like the safety in using a know pay terminal.

1ihw73d,https://www.reddit.com/r/WirelessHeadphonesHub/comments/1ihw73d/sony_wh1000xm4_review_with_model_details/,Sony WH1000XM4 review with model details B0863TXGM3: Worth the hype?,"I’ve been using the Sony WH1000XM4 headphones daily for several months now, and let me tell you, these have taken my listening experience to a whole new level. As someone who wears headphones for hours—whether working, commuting, or just chilling—I was looking for something that could deliver on sound quality, comfort, and noise cancellation. Spoiler alert: The WH1000XM4s impress, but they’re not perfect.

**Sound Quality**  
The sound clarity on these headphones is phenomenal. As a music lover who listens to everything from bass-heavy EDM to acoustic tracks, I found the Sony WH1000XM4s to deliver a rich and balanced listening experience. The bass hits deep without being overbearing, and the treble is crisp without feeling harsh. With the Digital Sound Enhancement Engine (DSEE) Extreme, compressed music files are upscaled, and I can genuinely hear the difference. However, I noticed that out of the box, the sound leans heavily into warm tones, which might be too bassy for some. A quick tweak in the Sony Headphones Connect app, though, and you’re golden.

**Fit & Comfort**  
Wearing these headphones is like wrapping your ears in a cloud. The ear cups are plush and large enough to cover my entire ears, which is a godsend during long work sessions. I have a relatively big head, so the adjustable headband is a lifesaver. That said, after about eight hours, I start to feel a little pressure on the top of my head. My partner, who has a smaller head, loves them and experiences no such discomfort. Glasses wearers, rejoice—these don’t pinch!

[Check Sony WH1000XM4 price on Amazon here.](https://wirelessemporium.com/product-reviews/sony-wh1000xm4-review-with-model-details-b0863txgm3/)

**Battery Life & Charging**  
Sony wasn’t kidding about the 30-hour battery life. I’ve gone days without plugging these in, and when I do, the quick charge feature gives me five hours of playtime in just ten minutes. That’s perfect for someone like me who forgets to charge their devices until the last minute. The USB-C charger is a welcome upgrade, but the included charging cable is ridiculously short. I had to buy a longer one for convenience.

**Connectivity**  
Pairing these headphones is straightforward, and the Bluetooth 5.0 connection is rock solid. I can walk across my apartment without any interruptions. The multipoint connection is a game-changer for switching between my laptop and phone seamlessly. However, enabling multipoint means sacrificing LDAC, which is disappointing if you’re an audiophile who treasures high-res audio.

**Noise Cancellation & Isolation**  
The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) on these is nothing short of magical. I tested them on a noisy flight, and the drone of the engines disappeared. It doesn’t create dead silence; instead, it feels like the world fades into the background. Voices and sudden noises are slightly audible, but they’re muffled enough not to be disruptive. The adaptive sound control is neat, but I turned it off because it kept adjusting when I moved around the house.

**Controls & Features**  
The touch controls on the right ear cup are intuitive—swipe up for volume, forward to skip tracks, and hold for your voice assistant. It’s responsive, though I occasionally find myself accidentally pausing music when adjusting the fit. The Speak-to-Chat feature, which pauses music when you start talking, is both brilliant and annoying. It’s great when you’re ordering coffee but frustrating when it triggers during a random cough.

**Water Resistance**  
Sadly, these headphones lack water resistance. While I’ve worn them to the gym, I’m cautious about excessive sweating. If you’re looking for headphones for rigorous workouts or rainy commutes, this might be a dealbreaker.

**Durability**  
The build quality feels premium, although they’re mostly plastic. They’ve survived being tossed into my bag without a case, but I wouldn’t call them rugged. The carry case included is sturdy, and I’d recommend using it if you want these to last.

**Pros**

* Outstanding noise cancellation for focus and travel.
* Rich, customizable sound quality.
* Long battery life with fast charging.
* Comfortable for extended use.
* Multipoint connection for two devices.

**Cons**

* Lack of water resistance limits active use.
* Short charging cable included.
* Speak-to-Chat can be overly sensitive.
* Plastic construction feels less premium compared to competitors.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
I’ve tried the Bose QuietComfort 45 and the AirPods Max. The Bose QC45 has slightly better comfort for extended wear but falls short in sound customization and bass depth. The AirPods Max, while offering excellent transparency mode, are heavier and significantly pricier. The Sony WH1000XM4s strike the best balance between premium sound, comfort, and affordability.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
These headphones are not cheap, but given the features you’re getting—top-tier ANC, exceptional sound quality, and a suite of smart features—they’re worth the investment. Compared to pricier options like the AirPods Max, the value here is undeniable. If you can catch these on sale, it’s a no-brainer.

1ihw6c4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1ihw6c4/travelers_club_richmond_spinner_luggage_bone/,Travelers Club Richmond Spinner Luggage Bone Carry-On 20-Inch review: Is It Worth the Hype?,"Packing for a short trip can be a battlefield, and the luggage you choose can either be a lifesaver or a complete nightmare. After using the Travelers Club Richmond Spinner Luggage, Bone, Carry-On 20-Inch for a few months, I’ve gathered some thoughts. This piece of luggage has been my go-to for a variety of trips, from quick work getaways to long weekends with the family. While it boasts many perks, there are a couple of quirks to consider if you're eyeing it for your travels.

**Design & Build Quality**

The look of this luggage is sleek and modern, with its bone-colored hard shell that does a good job of masking minor scuffs from handling. The hard shell feels solid, offering decent protection to your belongings. However, it’s worth noting that the logo plate on the front feels slightly flimsy—mine started to peel off after a few uses. While this didn’t affect the functionality, it’s something to be aware of. The aesthetic is understated yet chic, appealing to travelers who value both style and practicality.

**Wheels & Mobility**

The 360-degree spinner wheels are a standout feature. Gliding through busy airports was a breeze, and I could maneuver it with one hand while sipping coffee with the other. On smooth surfaces, it feels almost weightless. That said, the wheels struggled a little on uneven terrain like cobblestone streets, making it less ideal for certain travel scenarios. But for airports and hotel hallways, it’s a dream.

**Handles & Comfort**

The telescoping handle adjusts to multiple heights, which is great for people of different statures. However, the handle feels a bit wobbly when fully extended. Lowering it slightly helps, but I found myself wishing it was sturdier. The top handle makes lifting easier, though it lacks a side handle, which would have been a helpful addition for stowing it in overhead bins.

**Security Features**

This carry-on doesn’t include a built-in lock, so you’ll need to purchase your own if you’re concerned about security. The zippers are fairly robust, though occasionally they feel a bit stiff. For short domestic flights or trips where you’re always in close proximity to your luggage, this isn’t a deal-breaker, but it’s worth mentioning for those who plan to use it for international travel.

**Organization & Compartments**

Inside, the suitcase is fully lined and includes two compartments—a zippered section on one side and elastic straps on the other. This setup worked perfectly for separating clean clothes from shoes or toiletries. I used packing cubes to maximize the space, and I managed to fit a four-day wardrobe, a pair of sneakers, and a toiletry bag without any issues. However, additional internal pockets would have been a nice touch for smaller items like chargers or keys.

**Durability**

This luggage has held up well overall, surviving multiple trips and being tossed into overhead bins. The hard shell does a decent job of withstanding minor impacts, though I noticed a few scuffs after a particularly rough flight. The zippers and wheels have shown no signs of wear, which is a good sign for longevity.

**Water Resistance**

While the exterior provides some protection against light rain or spills, I wouldn’t trust it in heavy downpours. The zippers don’t seem to be waterproof, so if you’re caught in bad weather, you might want to cover it with a rain protector.

**Pros**

* Smooth 360-degree spinner wheels for easy navigation.
* Stylish bone color that resists minor scuffs.
* Lightweight yet spacious interior.
* Compact size that fits most airline carry-on requirements.
* Durable hard shell for added protection.

**Cons**

* Telescoping handle feels wobbly when fully extended.
* No built-in lock or advanced security features.
* Lacks a side handle, making it harder to maneuver in tight spaces.
* Limited water resistance could be an issue in heavy rain.
* Logo plate on the front may peel off with use.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When compared to similar models, such as Samsonite Omni PC and American Tourister Moonlight, the Travelers Club Richmond Spinner stands out for its affordability and sleek design. The Samsonite Omni PC offers better durability and built-in TSA-approved locks, but it comes at a significantly higher price point. Meanwhile, the American Tourister Moonlight has more vibrant design options but lacks the same level of interior organization offered by the Richmond Spinner. If budget and style are your priorities, the Richmond Spinner is a strong contender.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Given its features, the Travelers Club Richmond Spinner Luggage offers excellent value for money. It’s not the most premium carry-on out there, but it’s reliable and stylish for the price. For casual travelers or those on a budget, it’s a solid investment. However, frequent flyers might want to consider a more robust option with additional features, even if it means spending a bit more.

**Final Thoughts? Well, none here, just the facts.**

This luggage has been a dependable travel companion. It’s not perfect, but for its price range, the Travelers Club Richmond Spinner Luggage in Bone delivers a stylish and functional experience. If you’re in need of a carry-on that combines affordability with practicality, this might just be the one for you.

I have to get up at 5am every day for work because otherwise I would barely afford being a student. If I didn’t have my job my parents wouldn’t be proud of me I feel like and I wouldn’t be able to do things I enjoy. But I’m just so sick of going to bed at 9, missing out on things I want to do in evenings and then not even sleeping until midnight. I feel like I’m going to have a panic attack because I had slightly more coffee than usual today and it’s just like oh my god can my body calm down. I have suspicious moles on my body which I never knew were dangerous and should be checked, but UK healthcare quality is so shit because the NHS is under strain and I feel I would have to pay hundreds for them to catch and remove melanoma on time before it gets bad.
I’m so stressed and I have so much on my plate right now that I can’t even nap after my shift. I’m just so tired of this shit, and when I get time alone to my thoughts all I can think is cancer cancer cancer constantly and I can’t even trust the doctors looking at it because they let my mum die and misdiagnosed her so many times to thw point where it was too late. It’s getting to the point where I have moments where I want to end it all and other moments where I’m feeling so inspired and it’s exhausting going through these mood swings.

My boyfriend also wakes up early for his job bi weekly but he does way more hours than me. I can’t really talk to him about it because he will say how he’s doing more work than me. On top of this I have friends that can’t even be bothered to keep up with me so I’m putting all the effort in (except a fair few) including my best friend from primary school who just seems to have forgotten I exist since we went our separate ways.

I don't know anyone else with a sleep disorder nor do I know any adults without one who don't rely on some kind of stimulant day to day anyway.

Here's what I've tried so far and why it doesn't work for me:

  
1. big caffeine (coffee, matcha, yerba mate)

* even small amounts cause nausea, diarrhea, headaches, jitters for days following
* increased sleep walking

2. small caffeine (coke, pepsi)

* even small amounts cause pounding headaches that I can only escape through sleep

3. adhd meds (dexedrine)

* short term: increased sleep walking
* long term: fucked up my body so bad I've been off them for 2 months and I'm still not back to normal yet (eg. couldn't leave the house within 4 hours of eating cause of severe pain, vomiting, and diarrhea)

4. just taking the nap before the nap takes me

* I typically enter REM sleep in under 5 minutes, so I can't power nap without waking up more tired and a 90\* minute nap every day will be rough for me as I enter the workforce
   * \*also for 2 weeks of my cycle, every nap intentional or otherwise winds up being at last 3 hours no matter what I've tried to wake myself up
* no matter how refreshed I feel after a nap, my body always seems ready for another nap

5. sedatives (clonazepam) - to improve my quality of sleep at night by relaxing my muscles in my sleep and discouraging sleep walking  

* one (1) pill took me out for the better part of three (3) days

Like, I get white guilt is a thing and you want to prove that you're One Of The Good Ones who has The Right Opinions and is Totally Not Racist and it is important to use your privilege in activist spaces because people will actually listen to you, but this almost comes off as self-flagilating and trying to distance yourself from your own whiteness. You want to show that you're aware of your privilege and that you are intersectional and that is great, truly. Bottom line is you are still white.

I've even heard people say ""well I'm not that kind of white"" when discussing things like coffee order or music taste. Girl, youre from thr south of England and went to a Russell Group university. You're white. Maybe your great great grandparents weren't exactly Bridgertons, but they weren't strugglign either. They had a maid.

So I share a couple of classes with this guy and we started talking a little. He was super nice and we got along.  He eventually asked me if I wanted to get coffee with him. I was pretty hesitant at first but I ended up agreeing. After the coffee I realized that he may have been looking for a relationship. But with me moving in a few months and not wanting to get into a relationship, he also wasn't really my type, I asked for clarification about his feelings and told him that I would love to still be friends if he was okay with it. He took some time to think about it and said that he would be happy to, which was great.

 Now, I don't have a lot of experience being friends with guys so I don't know what is normal. We also don't know each other very well so I don't know if he is acting too familiar or what. After we became friends again he was still acting very similar to before. He would go out of his way to sit next to me in class, complement my outfits and looks, and try to hang out with me alone.

I made a post before but deleted it as it did not have enough context and I didn’t feel like typing the whole thing lol. I’m going to try to go into more detail: 

Does anyone else deal with this?! MIL usually very nice. BUT. if there’s an issue/disagreement, she flies off the handle?! 

1st occurrence: 
Back when I was dating my fiancée (getting married in April) we were guests out of state at my fiancé’s relatives. They were all in a different political spectrum than I am so I didn’t want to engage in a debate. We were playing cards. They were talking politics quite for quite a while but it didn’t bother me. Someone said something to me and politely smiled and said “I’m not going to comment.” Now I am not a U.S citizen YET.  My MIL said, “well this is a conversation for people who could vote.” Well. Shortly after that, I got up and said I’m going to call it a night. Apparently they made a big deal about why I left and sent my fiance to ask why. I told him why. She apparently had meant that as “people who were not old enough to vote at that time when so and so ran.” So maybe I completely misunderstood. Where it got crazy is when his mom came downstairs and was literally screaming at me. “Are you trying to divide our family?! Don’t put (fiance) up to this.” She would not let me talk or explain she just kept screaming and my fiance tried to calm her down but unsuccessfully. She then started to threaten to drive home immediately which was a 5 hour drive in the middle of the night. She sent a text to her friend saying how I’m insisting on making everything negative and other things but accidentally sent it to me… 
The next morning I woke up early, I made her coffee, I apologized for the misunderstanding and hugged her and she left very early! Now looking back on that, I think that was crazy that I did not demand ab apology. 

Since then things have been good. One might say great. Although here and there I would feel uncomfortable. For example, I was not raised christian. I come from a VERY non-religious country but they check the box as muslim, including my family. Well ever since she found that out she has brought it up to me a lot and out of concern. I tried to tell her not to worry about it like we really DONT care and have never practiced it and she still would ask me on Christmas nights twice, “So what is your family doing tonight?” I would say Nothing. They are muslim. What is the percentage of muslim people there? And then she brought up twice that she WILL take my kids to Sunday school. I don’t have kids, I am not even pregnant. I finally said we have not thought about that but it’s something that my husband and I would decide!  She took me on a walk the next day and told me about a story how her friend’s daughter can never see her kids due to drug addiction. How in Iowa we don’t have grandparent rights unless the parent is deceased but she told her friend, “you start the fight to change the law and I’m right behind you.” That was meant as a threat to me, right?! Am I missing something here? Other instances include she has shared private things (medical history) with her friend that has made me uncomfortable. 

2nd Occurrence: 
She has an only son and that over the years she’s given many gifts to people. She wanted to throw me 2 bridal showers- have her friends throw them to return the favor. I agreed. Well, apparently her friend wanted to open a bank account for me? It’s very tacky now I understand this, but we are going out of country for our honeymoon so we didn’t want gifts but a contribution to our honeymoon fund. She texted me in a group chat with her friend saying, (Friend) is thinking of opening an account for both showers and she needs your social security number and I know money gets taken out of your paycheck but to be honest I don’t know if you have one. Can you get with her to provide this information?! 

I obviously did not provide them with my SSN, but then went on to say: not that it matters but I came to this country as a foreign exchange student, then as an international student, then as a diplomatic staff for my country, I finished my masters degree….etc. All of that to say, yes I do have a social security number. Well…. She flew OFF the handle. Called my fiance, wrote two pages of complaints about me how we’re ungrateful, and DEMANDED to speak in person. He went there and spent one hour and a half trying to calm her down and speak sense to her how she hurt me. 

Now we are fine and have apologized to each other but I just don’t trust her anymore. And I felt all of this caused me a lot of stress and I canceled both showers (one of which the invites were already sent). I feel good about this decision because I don’t want her to continue to guilt trip us with the “we do so much for you” among other reasons. 

So that’s my story lol. What do you think?! 🤔 ",7,1738711599.0,JUSTNOMIL,8,1.0,False

Every single day since we announced that we were expecting I would talk to his mother multiple times a day. I had the free time due to maternity leave and relaxing enjoying being pregnant and his mother was freshly retired. Since I've had the baby it's been non stop callin. Even during labor she was non stop calling. I got him to make a statement to her that it's okay to call about twice a week but to please not to blow up my phone but she will not listen. As I stated the baby is 3 months now and he's currently experiencing an uncomfortable growth spurt, his wake windows are wayyyy longer, he's more cranky and gassy and cries for a lot longer and he wants to play and read and eat much more so I haven't been able to answer my phone or even really be on my phone as much. And with the time that he's napping I will nap or do some household things or grocery shopping or just spend time to myself. I'm freshly postpartum and deserve to go out and get my nails done or get a coffee. His mother is absolutely furious at this. She will call me 9 plus times a day every single day back to back hour to hour. I even send polite texts sometimes saying ""hey I'm busy with the baby he's ok"" or ""hey at the doctors with baby"" etc but she won't listen. She always calls more times and when I answer she says ""You know you can still call"" or ""are you on campus where is the baby"" ""how's the baby's poop"" ""how's he drinking"" ""do you hate me why are you avoiding me"" and it's like maam i just talked to you yesterday for 3 hours and the day before for 2. She has other grandchildren so it's not like our baby is the first and we do live kinda away but her other child lives in Japan (military family) and she still doesn't blow up their phones that much, and these children can actually speak they're pre teens so why are you blowing me up to speak to an infant that's sleeping whenever you call. I told her that I am extremely busy, I have work, college, a baby and a family and life to uphold yet she still says ""you don't have to overact and ignore me I just want to know if the baby is ok"" Which I don't understand because they baby was carried full term and has zero complications so what is there to see if the baby is ok or healthy for? I just told you 24 hours ago he's okay. Am I overreacting? She says I am but this is becoming very stressful. Especially if I'm trying to do a task and the baby is crying and I go to tend to the baby and she calls 6 times in a row or if I'm trying to play white noise or lullabies on my speaker and it keeps waking the baby because she's calling... and she just called as I was typing this I spoke to her at 7am and since then she's called 4 times on phone and 5 on Facebook messenger.",0,1738711511.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.5,False

 I am a Nerd of all Trades, loving comic books, scifi and Fantasy, history,  board games, plastic modeling and so much more geeky neurodivergent friendly adventures.

As far as non geeky activities, I love cooking, my specialties are leg of lamb and greek flatbread as well as some fantastic fried chicken.  For breakfast I love making waffles, and for dessert I make a mean sous vide cheesecake and chocolate chip cookies.  I’ve also been known to make my own cannabutter for these desserts. I’m passionate in my politics and activism for the LGBT community.

I have a pair of cats who vacillate wildly between overly affectionate and dismissive.  Like cats do.

I’m a hopeless romantic and consummate kinkster at once.  I love cooking romantic dinners and going on cute picnics and trying new things together.  I also enjoy playing the dominant in every sense.  I love outfit control, having partners that can be dressed up and shown off in lingerie and slutty clubwear, but of course everyone looks better in a collar.  

I am open to conversation that’s mild or spicy. Say hello, and let’s flirt  over some fair trade coffee!

Who am I looking for?  Well I’m hoping to find men, women, or couples nearby(long distance can work if we really hit it off).   Please no one under 23 or over 50.  I Dom in Kink and Top in bed, I have been known to be a verse for partners once we build trust.

I am usually day shift in a care facility but I've been covering nights for a month to help out. Tonight is my last night shift. 

When I woke up today I went to ask if my partner wanted a decaf coffee when I was making mine and he decided to ask in a very confrontational way if I am ever going to be 'in the mood' for sex again as I am apparently making no effort to be intimate. And this leads to a spiral of him saying I don't make any effort to look nice, dress 'the same' as him and he doesn't like boys so should think of him when I'm dressing. (Does anyone wear anything that isn't joggers and a hoodie for a busy night shift? Comfort is key).

I go to sleep as he wakes up and when he's winding down to sleep I'm going to work. It just hasn't worked out that way and I didn't see it as a big deal until he got angry this evening that I wasn't touching him enough???
I will also add that I work 40 hours of night shift a week and he works 16 hours a week as a part time cleaner.

Anyway I'm probably gonna get off night shift and leave his ungrateful ass I just wanted to see if anyone had any experience with partners not being understanding about night shift. 

I'm not gonna stay in a relationship with someone that clearly only values me for one reason lol. ",8,1738711448.0,Nightshift,6,0.9,False

i've been thinking of the idea of someone randomly sending me a dm/friend request by someone i don't know. maybe it starts out normal but after a couple days it slowly turns into obsession, and now i get spammed if im gone for even a minute. getting sent paragraphs of confessions, and fantasies, and creepy desires. random images of their growing shrine to me- full of pictures of me i don't even know how they got, full of clothes and hair they somehow have cut off and collected. someone who'd drop everyone and everything in their life just to be closer to me- even if it means moving countries, because their obsession makes them not want anyone but me. someone who stops talking to everyone else if it means they can talk to me, who'd carve my name into their skin, who can't even stand being alive if they can't have me

maybe they'll coincidentally be in my area, despite me never mentioning where i live. maybe they'll have a pillow case that looks suspiciously like my missing shirt, a doll that looks a bit too much like me, a bunch of photos hanging up and as screensavers that i don't remember sending. somehow they'll always know where i am, even if i never tell them. maybe they'll spend hours analyzing the background of photos to see where to relocate, somehow ending up as one of my coworkers and in my classes. proudly showing off wounds from where they missed me, my name carved neatly into their skin forever as they claimed themselves as mine. maybe ill take up their thoughts so much it's all they can think about, no other stored information is nearly as important as me

casually mentioning something physical i find attractive, and watching them mysteriously ""have the same idea"" and show up with it. unmarked gifts and flowers showing up on my doorstep and in my room, and them somehow knowing about it but never admitting to sending it. getting mysterious texts despite me never mentioning my number, mysterious heartfelt love letters and confessions with information ive never mentioned. someone who only finds me attractive, and is only attracted to me (platonically, romantically, sexually, just in every way). having my schedule memorized, them somehow appearing at my favorite coffee shops and stores. asking questions during conversations that will get me say facts about me they already know

someone who's like a sim without a command when i'm not around or messaging them. who literally goes insane without me, who would do anything for me, to have me. scribbles of my name on their skin, in their notebooks, on their desk. someone who goes insane thinking about me, and without me, who's so consumed with love they literally can't function if i so much as stop talking for even a minute, so much that they're barely a person until i reply again

like i know this is all insane to have as desires, but i'd be so happy if someone was genuinely so insane with love it scared me. i wish i was brave enough to go looking for someone like this ( ╥ ᴗ ╥)",2,1738711391.0,Obsessive_Love,0,0.63,False

1ihvq98,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1ihvq98/last_night_disappointment_today_new_opportunities/,"Last night, disappointment. Today, new opportunities.","I met a POT SB in early January. We really hit it off. We had dinner and walked across the street for drinks. Everything was going so well, but it was our first date, and there was no expectation of intimacy. She told me the next few weeks would be a challenge for her due to a personal matter, which I understood. I told her I was giving someone until the end of the month to decide what she wants to do (stay or leave.) She understood and we agreed to keep in touch.

Over the course of the month I got to know her somewhat well (more than just familiar) via text exchanges. Initially it was a bit slow, but over the past couple of weeks I began to sense she was warming up to me, and I would drop little gifts of cash for her here and there (coffee, dinner, travel expenses, etc.) It seemed she genuinely enjoyed and appreciated the attention and consideration.

Fast forward to last week and it's transitioned to sexting. She drops a lude, she receives a nude. It's all good, sexy back and forth banter. She tells me what she wants to do to make me happy. I respond in kind. I ask her when we can make this happen, she responds with ""How about Monday evening?"" I let her know I had reservations for Friday that fell through, so I'll go ahead and change them to Monday and we can meet at 6:30pm.

I brought up the topic of an allowance. I asked her if she's thought about one, and we acknowledge that to this point, everything I've given her has been spur of the moment and unplanned. It felt fun and spontaneous, but with the expectation that it would lead to something. She told me she hasn't really thought about it, she's still new to this and figuring it all out. She said she would like to take things as they come and ""go with the flow."" That's the phrase she dropped. I brought up that many hotels were already booked this week, but I'd find something that is within the range of ""acceptable"" and that she wouldn't be disappointed. I mentioned the hotel again Monday morning and she replied with some witty banter and a ""hahahaha.""

I agreed with her that things were working out thus far and I liked the way they were progressing, all things considered. We agreed to meet on Monday (last night) and although she was late, she did show up. I paid for her ride share, of course, and she looked great.

We had dinner, shared food from each other's plates, and talked about the hotel. We had decent conversation, nothing memorable, and I noticed her attention was anywhere in the room but me. It was the exact opposite energy I expected after having such a wonderful evening a month ago. During dinner she also surprised me with news that she's going out of town on Wednesday and wouldn't be back until Saturday. That's something you'd think would come up before Monday evening's dinner. Anyway, it was a small red flag which I tried to look past.

She started to walk with me to the garage, and about half way there she stopped and told me she has to get up early for work in the morning but she'd talk to me soon. I told her I'm sorry if I said something to upset her, and she walked away quickly saying she'd call her own Uber and she'll talk to me soon.

So look, I've been here before. I've been to these second dates where the POT SB flakes out and leaves as soon as we hit the street. In those cases they were rinsing me, and I realized it right away. In this case, she wasn't rinsing me so much as dropping subtle hints of her activities and I was responding in kind to keep her interested until we met last night.

I texted her and asked her if I should return the gift which was waiting for her back in the room. She apologized and seemed sincere in that she was sorry she caused me inconvenience or pain, and that she just isn't ready for this.

I explained I've been through this several times before, but I was totally caught off guard by this. I also stated I would understand and not pin my feelings on her. She thanked me for my patience. Somehow through the following text exchanges it started to go down the drain until she was claiming that there was no agreement, no understanding, and that she should not be made to feel guilty about not having sex with me. I told her I wasn't trying to guilt trip her, but the entire point of a sugar relationship is that we do things you do in vanilla dating, but there is a mutually beneficial aspect to it and she was understanding of this when she signed up.

She said she never asked me to buy her anything, she didn't ask me to invite her to such a nice restaraunt, she never asked me to book a hotel. All I could think was back to a prior paragraph where I explained the sexting and the fact I specifically asked her how we could take this to the next level. She knew what was happening, she was a willing participant. Then, suddenly, she wasn't.

Long story short, she didn't like being called out, and I didn't like being told I was ""unkind."" Granted, I have spent about $1600 on this budding SR since the beginning of January, and we never had sex or even kissed.  Ultimately, she blocked me because I told her that certain phrases she uses such as ""this is supposed to be fun"" where for me there's nothing fun about planning an entire night only to have her show up late and leave early is a red flag. OK, after she called me ""unkind"" I said wow, you're just like the scammers I've met. So I did instigate it, but she knew about everything ahead of time and no one likes to be rejected when they're paying for it.

Today I messaged someone I met in the wild last week. I explained I've been enjoying our infrequent back and forth, but I was interested in her and I didn't want to mislead her. She liked some selfies I had sent her, and she responded with some of her own. She looked stunning. I told her as much, and explained that I felt like I needed to ""step up the game"" since she was ""so well put together."" I mentioned how one of the photos made me want to pay her rent. She was not at all opposed to this topic of discussion. We had a nice phone call during her lunch hour, and I think things will move in that direction. I admit I have looked her up, and pimeyes indicates she's had an onlyfans at one point or another, and there were other possible matches for sexually explicit photos, but I don't care. Everyone has their past, and I'm no choir boy.

Here's to new beginnings, and I hope the previous POT either figures her shit out or finds someone who is willing to wait 4 years for the possibility of a night cap.",7,1738711344.0,sugarlifestyleforum,14,1.0,False

Trading nominal baseball cards or jerseys are all under the umbrella of acceptable negotiations and trades. But when’s it large scale and has actual implication your job and livelihood, I don’t know about that. 

Nico is friends with Rob Pelinka. It would be naive to assume that’s the only friendship in the NBA involving two active GM’s/Presidents but their friendship must’ve been really close to just be casually discussing trading a top 5 player over coffee in a serious manner. 

The point of a trade is to give something up to get something. Each party wants to ideally “win the trade”. Realistically both teams can’t win the trade (very rare both teams “win”) but especially if it’s a top 3 player that’s being shipped and you’re not receiving a Herschel Walker package of picks or either of the two players ahead of that top 3 player. 

You want to trade for Anthony Davis, fine. You want to trade Luka for him. Ok, that’s weird but  alright. At this point you have to slaughter the Lakers future and collect enough picks to potentially salvage this trade as much as possible. If it doesn’t go through, move on and continue shopping Luka. But no, Nico really wanted to continue being invited to Rob’s Friendsgiving.

I thought I would come on here and ask for some advice because I'm very confused about what's going on with me and I'm starting to suspect hypoglycemia but I'm not totally sure. Anyways, a year ago from today, I was overweight as my diet consisted of nothing but junk food. In late March of 2024, l decided to change my diet, get healthy, and loose weight. I cut every junk food imaginable out of my diet and began counting my calories daily. From there, I lost 40lbs and hit 112lbs in June of 2024. I've been maintaining 112lbs ever since then and have been continuing to diet in order to stay slim and maintain my weight. However, beginning in August 2024, I began experiencing symptoms of low blood sugar almost every night and have been dealing with this ever since. I feel tingly, dizzy, my heart palpitates, I get sweaty, shaky, and l even feel lethargic. This typically happens when I fast (usually when I hit the 13 or 14 hour mark in my fasting window which is always later at night since I start in the morning) but it also happens too on days/nights that l'm not even fasting. Now, if eat a bowl of cereal or a protein bar or some rice cakes when I'm experiencing symptoms of low blood sugar (typically late at night like I said), l'll feel better for no longer than 15 min after eating and then BOOM, my blood sugar sky rockets and I feel like I'm on a crazy sugar high for the next hour. If I had to describe the feeling, it feels like I drank 3 cups of coffee back to back. However, I only get this reaction from those types of foods with some sugar in them (cereals, protein bars, rice cakes) if I eat them while I'm having a low blood sugar episode. Otherwise, if I eat them when I'm feeling fine, nothing happens as my blood sugar does not spike. In other words, my blood sugar only spikes when I eat slightly sugary items whilst my sugar is low. I'm very confused as to what's happening with me because i have no explanation for the cause of my low blood sugar, as well as the symptoms that it causes, and then the intense reaction to slightly sugary foods when they are consumed during a low blood sugar episode.

> iiiii generally do not like politics ! they don't so much bore me as they do stress me out (lmao) but that's honestly the reason i like Yoshida's confidant so much!! it touches on some of the genuine issues in society and with him formerly being the center of several scandals it also helps show that your worst mistakes don't necessarily have to define you as a person unless you allow them to. i really appreciate that kind of message in media

11) **Makoto Nijima** (Priestess)
> i'm a simple person who is a sucker for the fake dating trope (so long as it's not icky. looking at you Ohya /hj) so even if Makoto's confidant is a little plain overall (and a little bit of a slap to the face if you're doing it post-November 😭) i do really enjoy it!! just don't be a cop girl you can do better 🙏

10) **Goro Akechi** (Justice)
> this one is just genuinely so fucking funny. his ranks 3 and 7 in particular absolutely KILL ME every single time i see them and to this day they never get any less hysterical. the sheer shock in his reaction after the disguise in his rank 3 is pure gold 😭

9) **Kasumi Yoshizawa** (Faith)
> i love Sumi dearly but she is truly only this high up because her ranks 6-9 fascinate me a lot more than 2-5. the first few are silly and i enjoy them (like the bento disaster. my god 😭) but i also really appreciate the more serious direction the other half of her story takes later on!!

8) **Hifumi Togo** (Star)
> it's the mommy issues that does me in here 😭 even my mother's not this off the rails but she's still Out There enough that it felt very cathartic doing Hifumi's Mementos request god bless. plus i just love her as a character and genuinely enjoyed each of her confidant events!!

7) **Takuto Maruki** (Councillor)
> oh Maruki. oh buddy. i'm a huge nerd for things like moral dilemmas and psychological teasers that actually make you think, so the whole thing about cognitive psience and him seeking Joker's opinion on whether pain is necessary or not really grabbed my attention from the beginning. his events being a mix of thought-provoking and silly was just a bonus

6) **Shinya Oda** (Tower)
> let the record show that i love children who aren't mine (i am Not stable enough for that 💀) so when i saw a confidant opportunity with an Actual Child (a gamer no less) i was immediately won over. the storyline with his mom? as i stated in my reasoning for Hifumi, it's the mommy issues for me 😭 his situation hits especially close to home for me so even if his confidant isn't necessarily as exciting as some of the others it deserves a spot in my top 5 nonetheless

5) **Munehisa Iwai** (Hanged Man)
> father figure <3 i love how half of his confidant is straight up him learning how to be a dad by asking advice from a 16-year-old kid who spends way too much time around his shop for being on probation and the other half of it is spent straight up violating said probation which is so stupidly funny to me 😭

4) **Futaba Sakura** (Hermit)
> Futaba is genuinely one of my favorite characters in this entire trainwreck (/mostly pos) of a game and her confidant is one of the ones i always look forward to unlocking because i just. enjoy it and her as a character!!! truly my favorite socially anxious gremlin and i really love the way her and Sojiro's confidants intertwine so you can see just how important they are to each other (that is her dad!!!!! 🥹)

3) **Sojiro Sakura** (Hierophant)
> same reasoning as Futaba! i love him as a character (coffee dad is just a bonus lmao) and even from the very beginning you can see how much he cares and how much effort he puts into pretending he doesn't and truly i am WEAK for that trope 🙏

2) **Tae Takemi** (Death)
> coughs. i'll get it out of the way and say i definitely have a type and it includes punk women so from the minute she was first shown i decided i was on a Mission. her story is one of my favorites (as. clearly evidenced by her placement lmao) and i just love her dearly as a character. mother energy,,,

1) **Sadayo Kawakami** (Temperance)
> there is So Much i could say about Kawakami's confidant truly. hers being my overall favorite is in no way a difficult placement because as much as i love the others, there's just so much about Kawakami's story and character that i absolutely adore. i love the motherly energy (mommy issues strike again y'all 💀) and i just appreciate the fact that her confidant sheds so much light on her detached behavior from the beginning of the game, and it really makes you feel for her. i also just love the fact that all she really needed was someone to *care* about her situation and i absolutely adored being able to see her situation improve and see how much happier she was.

I am not me.,"I once enjoyed being social, getting dressed up and going out for a coffee or meal. Now I barely care to put makeup on and when I do it’s not the same. I used to enjoy getting ready now it’s just a chore. 

I used to like the idea of sex and men. I haven’t had any interest for a few years. 

I used to enjoy shopping, travel, music, concerts, even using social media. Now I haven’t been on social for a long time. I don’t care. 

And the depression, the deep lonely empty hole that I try to fill each day. The dark void that I have become used to. I don’t talk to my family or friends anymore, I don’t want to go anywhere. I have no purpose. 

But as I type this I still downplay that this is actually happening and that it’s bad because it’s been creeping in for years. It’s all I know. 

I can’t understand how the person I was see my whole life just disappeared and now I’m an angry, miserable, tired, hopeless mess. 

The only positive to come out of this is that I’ve cut out all the crappy people in my life and only want genuine friends.

1ihvf8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims1/comments/1ihvf8n/sharing_several_old_fixesmods/,Sharing Several Old Fixes/Mods,"I have a handful of bug fixes/mods I made back when Sims 1 was still newer and with the digital release want to share some of them.  Most are minor fixes for things like missing animation errors that were still present in the Complete Collection release and I doubt are patched in the new release.  I haven't tested these on the new release but they all work on the physical Complete Collection, by placing them in the ""The Sims/GameData/Objects/"" folder.  These mods all act as replacements to base game files, so any mods that do the same would likely conflict.



Here's the list of the fixes/mods:

**Butler Unleashed Fridge Fix** -  The butler will not prepare food if you have the refrigerator that was added in Unleashed.  This fixes that.

**Coffee Table Fixes**  -  Coffee tables have multiple issues when used as a surface: children get a missing animation error when picking up items off them, and the newspaper can't be placed on coffee tables when brought in.  This fixes that and also allows newspapers/tabloid and table lamps to be placed on coffee tables in buy mode.

**Item Rating Fixes** - This fixes a couple discrepancies between what the buy mode catalog shows and what the item actually does. Also fixes one of the cheap couches that for some reason appreciates instead of depreciating.

**Kids Prepare Quick Meals**  - This isn't a bug fix, but just something I always thought was missing.   This allows children to prepare Quick Meals.  They won't use a stove or food processor, but can use the microwave and toaster oven.

**Kids Shoo Raccoon Animation Fix** - Fixes the ""missing animation"" error when children try and shoo the raccoon.

**Put Away Pet Awards** - The Pet Awards from Unleashed are normally placed on a shelf or cabinet when first brought home, but if you remove them from the shelf or don't have a shelf they get placed on the floor and cannot be interacted with.  This adds a ""Put Away"" command similar to the vacation mementos so sims can place them back on a shelf.

**Put Dart Board in Buy Catalog** - I never understood why this item was only available in community lots so this adds the dart board to buy mode.

**All Stereo Stations** - Another one that's not a bug, but this adds all the House Party stations to every stereo instead of just the ones that came with the House Party  pack.

The poster there had a picture of his machine, and it looked different then ours

Fast forward a week later, I just received a warranty replacement from Ninja and sure enough the new machine I received is different then the one it was replacing. My first one had a brew temp option on the screen and this one has a strength setting there. Per the instruction manual, it even sounds like the espresso ratios are different on this machine. For espresso, the instruction manual says that a brew strength of 1 will give you a 4:1 ratio. On my other machine the highest ratio was a 3:1, not 4:1. The other 2 settings are the same ratios.

For drip coffee, my old machine offered 2 settings in the ""h"" menu. Mild and default. This machine offers 3 now directly on the screen. Mild, default, and bold. Also, on my last machine when choosing coffee, the grinder would recommend a setting of 25. On the new machine, the grinder suggests different (lower) settings based on strength choice and size of drink. 

The ""h"" menu is also different as brew temp is now located in there in this machine.",5,1738710461.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,2,0.86,False

1ihva89,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1ihva89/no_explanation/,No explanation,"Don't know if anyone will read this because I think it will be a long one, but gonna share my weird story here
here. 5 months ago, I met this girl on Hinge. From the first message I felt something. Felt something different, felt like she was really into me. And she was.
We went on a first date like after a full week of messaging and on that first date I felt like I've been with this girl for YEARS. She too! It was literally perfect. Week after she bought these tickets for a party I've bought months ago and went with me because it was in her city. Even invited me home to sleep at her place already. And that's where it all started. 2 weeks into messaging, I'm staying at her place, we're doing it. I thought okay maybe this will be this kind of a thing, but no. We fell in love real fast. I went there like every two days, stayed every weekend, not because of the s*x but because we had an awesome energy. So we started dating. She gave me some feeling I didn't have in years. I felt special. Oh an she felt it too
too, I can say that because of her actions. Always made me her priority. We hang out, played games together, went to a cinema, made dinners, had long walks together, literal perfection. Month in this relationship she surprises me with plane tickets to our ""home land' because we both live in another country, but are spending Christmas and NYE with our families in our home country. Sais she wanted me to stay longer and spend NYE with her because she chose wrong people to spend it with for the last couple of years and wanted to spend it with someone special now. She even told her parents about me and I met them for one time for a coffee. Her mother wrote her that I'm very generous and kind and that she looks real real in love
And it really was like that, she told me every day that she hasn't ever felt like that, so much in love, and so much loved. Than nobody was ever so kind and good to her and that she will do everything in her power to protect me and us. And I felt that too! I was flying, over the moon. Thought it was gonna be something basic but here we are, 3 months dating and I think I've found the one. Don't wanna be boring with all the details, you know how it is when you're in love and when everything goes so well that you just can't believe it's happening to you.
Until one day, 3 months later, just a normal regular wednesday when I get the message that she has something personal and that she needs space and time to go through it alone. I know what it is, but don't wanna write it here.
I was shocked at first, it was a long paragraph of her saying alot of things, that she went through it already once and that she did it by herself. I was anxious at first and told her okay but I'm here for you and don't want you doing it alone, but she insisted. 
Okay, I went down with it but told her if she needs anything that I'm always gonna be here. That's where everything weird started happening
She already booked a trip to London before we met, so 5 days after that message he left. We didn't have a lot of contact while she was there. She was supposed to be there one week, but after 2 days I get message from her mom that her phone was stolen and she is with her friend and everything was alright. So I waited, I thought she can reach to me over her friends phone, or anything to tell me that she's okay, but she didn't write a word until she came back. I started being suspicious already, but okay.
She wrote me a message when she came back and didn't talk anything about her trip there. Not how it was, not if she had a good time, nothing. Just that she got some sickness there, some virus, and that she is going to this friend of hers because she got that too. Okay I was asking myself now if she is avoiding me or what. She told me she needs to lay in bed and relax for one week, until 4 days later I see her posting a photo, STORY, om her TikTok. That's the only social media platform I followed her on because I have no Instagram. She put out a photo of her, all with make up, beautiful, before a night out. And I was like wait, aren't you at your friends house and in bed because you got virus and because you're sick? 
I never said anything about it, didn't wanna be rude, what a fool. And 3 days after that, altough our messages were low and she was responding with no real intentions, she stopped. I stopped too. Didn't message her for 3 weeks because hey, I thought she needs space and time and I'm not gonna be boring, I will wait.....
I went to vacation 3 weeks in this no contact, and I really needed that cuz I was so lost and had so many questions and 0 answers. Why is this going on? What is happening? Where did her spark go? What did I do?
Friend of mine sam that I was on my lowest for weeks, and she messaged her and told her that I really need an explanation because I'm not well and that I'm not gonna contact her, but he wanted the closure for me. It was eating me inside, and I never said to him to do it, but thank God he did. 
She replied to him saying she moved to another city, started a new job and that he can say it to me if he wants, or not if he doesn't want to.
It wasn't really a closure and I still have so many questions to this day, but after 3 weeks of ignoring me, it was something....he told me that, and next morning I sent her a long paragraph to say how I feel because she never asked me. I mainly said that I'm disappointed in her behaviour and leaving without saying a word. Breaking up without saying a word. Just shopping messaging me out of the blue without explaining what I did wrong or what is her problem. And that's when I last heard of her. She replied to me saying she wishes me all the best, if I can delete number of her mother and that I take care.
Again no closure, no explanation, no anything, just thinking of herself. Said that she isn't going to our home country because she doesn't feel well, but her mom put out WhatsApp stories weeks later with them all together there altough she said she ain't going.
In the end, it all seems like she was running away from me. Like I was some kind of a psycho. Lying about everything, not going to our home country, being sick, moving to another city and finding new job, like I was gonna follow her or something.....
Still to this day don't know how to explain it all
all
From the best person and best feeling in the world, to complete strangers in a matter of days
Never did anything wrong, always gave her 101% of me, but obviously not that is enough these days...
It haunted me for weeks but I'm doing 100x better. From time to time I think about here but it's not eating me from inside because I realised why would I feel bad when someone can't value your time and all the good things you do and give for them.

Sorry for this long text, don't know if I feel better now but had to stare it with someone because I've been thinking about her for the last couple of nights after weeks of doing very very well!",0,1738710153.0,ExNoContact,0,0.5,False

It got me wondering—how many beans do you buy at a time? Should I be saving money by buying in bulk, or is freshness worth the trade-off?

What do you guys do?

This is mainly for people who buy beans online, but if you buy them in store I'm curious too!",1,1738710055.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1ihv4q3,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ihv4q3/lifestyle_changes/,Lifestyle Changes,"I got myself diagnosed about 6 months ago because I noticed that my career growth had halted. I didn't have a particularly hard job, but I struggled to keep up with my colleagues, was constantly told off for my attention to detail, and completely burnt out. There were other things (emotional disregulation, RSD, clumsiness, inability to be on time etc) but my work was pushing me over the edge and I felt like a total failure.

I decided to opt out of medication for now (my husband and I are TTC) and make lifestyle changes. In order to do that, I had to acknowledge that I'm inherently different from the ""norm"" and accept that my personal ideas of success might be out of alginment with my strengths and weaknesses. I allowed myself to ditch my old ideas of what success looked like, and to focus instead on what would make me happy and content.

Since then I've taken some time off work and done part time temping. I worked for a really friendly company as a receptionist/ admin and loved it. I was sad when the contract ended a couple of months ago, but pleasantly surprised when they offered me a permanent job this week. 

It's a simple job, but that comes with less stress. It pays less, and I've opted to work part-time (Wednesday afternoons off for painting, knitting, cooking, exercising (35h/w)).

I know that I'm in a privileged position to be able to work part time, but I decided that I don't want to exchange all my time for ""things"" anymore. I can keep prices down if I stop buying stuff I don't need, like lunch out and coffees.

I feel like I've achieved something big for myself. I'm finally prioritizing the things that I've long suspected would make me happy. It involved some long talks with my hubby (who is very career driven) but he sees where I'm coming from.

I hope my life will be a little (or a lot) more relaxed now. I feel like my diagnosis has come with growth and knowledge, and I'm super grateful. ",4,1738709758.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

1ihv2w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1ihv2w9/the_animosity_of_my_bedroom_part_1/,The animosity of my bedroom. -Part 1,"I have had the same room since I was 3-4 years old, and nothing weird happened until years later. In those years, a lot happened: disagreements, fights, and divorce. My parents' divorce led to me mainly living at my mom’s place but going to my dad’s on the weekend. At this point, I could have been 8-9 years old. To add to the story, another person would regularly come over on the weekends: my cousin.  My cousin was younger by just one year, and that closeness in age made us close and being able to play every weekend at my dad's house made us even closer. We would play Barbies all night in the basement, Assembling different “rooms” and just having fun until we got tired. The darkness in the house did not scare us before, at least not before this. This night was like any other weekend; we had been playing with our Barbies all night; at this point, it had to be in the A.M.s, and we were tired. We decided to sleep in my room since that was where the bed was; I mean, duh. We started to put enough stuff away not to get my dad mad at us, but enough out so we didn't have to reassemble everything the following morning; when we were done, we decided to leave. We went upstairs, talking about what we would do the next morning with no care; we soon were in my room and were so tired. So when my cousin stayed over, we had to do something, which was to have some sort of light for my cousin since she was scared of the dark when it was time to sleep. At times, we decided to leave the light in the closet on and a light connected to the head of the bed. we then got in the bed, ready to sleep. I started getting comfortable, my eyes closed, and suddenly, I heard some breathing. my eyes opened, startled by this; it couldn’t be my cousin. I immediately called out my cousin’s name. “E, are you hearing that?” she whispered, “Yes,” This breathing seemed to be the loudest thing in the room as if someone was taking deep breaths and exhaling loudly. It didn’t have a particular place it had come from, it seemed to be everywhere. After a minute, I whispered back to my cousin, “What if we go to my dad’s room and tell him?” a few seconds passed, and she answered, “Okay.” “Okay, let's go now!” I lounged out of bed and ran out of my room with my cousin behind me. we went into my dad's room, and as a result, we bolted out of his bed, looking at us with a worried look. “What happened? Why are you guys waking me up when it's still dark outside?” My cousin and I were trying to explain, but once we calmed down enough, I explained to my dad, “ We were sleeping, or at least trying, when all of a sudden we heard deep breathing, but it sounded like a man breathing.” my dad looked at us confused, but walked with us to my room. We looked at him and waited for him to answer us. We stood there in silence; there was no sound in the house; my dad broke that silence, “It must have been the wind; you might have also imagined it. If anything, go to sleep.” he left the room while closing the door, and once again it was just me and her in there. We got into the bed and went to sleep. This reoccurrence would happen every time we stayed at my dad's house. This could have lasted for a year if I remember correctly. My cousin and I remembered this years later and laughed about it, not in a way where we genuinely found this funny, but in a way where we had no answer to those events and just had to laugh. Later, I talked to my dad about other funny stories from my childhood when I brought this up. His face immediately became stone cold, “Oh yeah, I remember.” I looked at him, perplexed at how he was more bothered by this than me or even my cousin, which we would joke about at this point. “Why are you reacting like that if it didn't happen to you?” I laughed. He looked away and explained, “ I believed you guys.” You seem to forget that I live alone in that house, see five days a week and seven overall. I know what happens in this house.” There was a pause, and he looked back at me. “Was I supposed to look at two little girls who were scared that they were right and that something was breathing in the room they were staying at? No, I couldn’t.” I looked at him now, surprised that he was saying that. At this point, my cousin and I had fought everyone, and these events had happened to us before. My dad kept saying, “I had called a friend after you guys left. (This friend was an individual intertwined with some spiritual stuff.) They had told me to cleanse your room and the entrance.” I stared with my mouth open, surprised he would admit this now. He made himself a coffee and left me with questions and answers. overall, maybe I wasn't as crazy as I initially thought.",1,1738709623.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False
1ihv2j4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1ihv2j4/my_doppelgänger/,My Doppelgänger,"I first saw her in the fractured mirror of my grandmother’s vanity, her face a waxen echo of mine—*almost* right. The curve of her smile dripped like candle tallow, her eyes voids where the light pooled but never surfaced. She mimed my movements, yet always a breath too slow, fingers lingering where mine retreated, as if tasting the air I’d touched.  

Nightmares became her language. She’d coil in the periphery, a smudge of wrongness against the wallpaper’s faded roses. I’d wake to whispers that weren’t voices but the sound of roots splitting soil, her breath against my neck—damp, moss-thick. My reflection began to…*ripen*. In shop windows, her skin bled a jaundiced gold; her teeth crowded like crooked headstones.  

“She’s coming closer,” I told the therapist, whose nod was a metronome counting down my sanity. His office reeked of camphor and false calm. “Doppelgängers are myth,” he said, as if naming a thing could unknot its truth. That evening, I found a clump of my hair in the sink, black and glistening. Hers, in the mirror, had thickened, lush as mildew.  

She seeped into my world. A coffee cup bore her lipstick—grease-red, fungal. My lover murmured *“You feel different”* in bed, his hands trembling. I stopped sleeping. Stopped eating. She thrived on my hunger, cheeks plumping with stolen vitality, her laughter a wet rustle in the pipes.  

The night she peeled herself from the mirror, the air curdled. She oozed through the glass, limbs unfolding like rotten origami, skin exuding a sweet-sour musk. I gagged; she inhaled my revulsion. “*I’m what festers in your marrow,*” she crooned, her voice a hive’s hum. “*The rot you’ve starved since girlhood.*”  

I fled to the woods, but the trees mirrored her—bark split into grins, branches arthritic fingers. She cornered me, moonlight lacquering her pallor. “*You can’t outrun the dirge,*” she hissed. Our hands met, hers swallowing mine, a fusion of fever and frost. I felt myself unraveling, a spool of shadow unthreaded.  

She wears my skin now. I watch from the glass as she kisses my lover with a tongue like a leech, as she devours my life in wet, grinning chunks. My face blooms on her, radiant as a corpseflower. They don’t notice the way her pupils swallow the light whole, how her shadow crawls independent of her body—a slick, liquid thing that pools beneath the bed, whispering.  

Sometimes, she presses against the mirror, her breath fogging my prison. “*Soon,*” she mouths, “*you’ll forget which of us was first.*” Her teeth are my teeth, sharpened.  

I’m forgetting already.  

The glass grows colder.  ",10,1738709596.0,shortscarystories,2,0.86,False

We all dream of living a fulfilling life, don't we? Whether it's success, peace of mind, or making genuine connections, happiness is at the core of our aspirations. But here's the secret sauce: happiness isn't just a mystical unicorn we're all chasing — it's a science! 🧪✨ And with the right steps, we can cultivate it and let it flourish in our daily lives. Ready to embark on this journey of happiness and fulfillment? Let's dive in!

1. **Gratitude Journaling 🙏**  
Start your day with positivity by jotting down three things you're grateful for! Scientists have proven that practicing gratitude shifts your focus from what's lacking to what's abundant in your life. It doesn't have to be grandiose — maybe it's just sipping your morning coffee ☕ or hearing your favorite song on the radio. Writing these down daily rewires your brain to search for the good, fostering a happier mindset.

2. **Exercise for Joy 🏃‍♀️🎶**  
Moving our bodies isn't just about looking good; it's about feeling good too! Physical activity releases endorphins, your body's natural mood elevators. And guess what? You don't need a grueling gym session to reap the benefits. A brisk walk in the park, dancing in your living room, or even a yoga session can do wonders for your emotional wellbeing. Plus, you'll feel accomplished and energized! 🚀

3. **The Power of Connection 💬💖**  
Human beings are innately social creatures, and having a supportive tribe can significantly impact our happiness levels. Reach out to friends and family, join a local club, or engage more in communities like Empowish! Sharing your goals, challenges, and victories fosters a sense of belonging. Remember, it’s not the quantity but the quality of these connections that matter.

4. **Embrace Mindfulness and Meditation 🧘‍♂️🌿**  
In our fast-paced world, it's easy to get swept up in stress and anxiety. Incorporating mindfulness practices like meditation can help ground you, reducing stress and enhancing emotional health. Start with a few minutes a day; apps like Headspace or Calm can guide you. Notice how your breathing slows, your mind clears, and a sense of calm washes over you. Ahhh. 😊

5. **Celebrate Small Wins 🎉✨**  
Goals can sometimes feel overwhelming if you focus solely on the endgame. Instead, recognize and celebrate the small milestones along the way. Did you manage to meditate every day this week? Cheers to that! Made it through a tough day? That's a win too! By celebrating these moments, you keep motivation high, reinforcing your path to success and happiness.

Remember, happiness is a practice, not a destination. It’s about the choices we make day in and day out and finding joy in the simple things. 🌟 You have the power to shape your happiness; start with these little changes and watch your life blossom!

Here's our current situation- grind whole beans weekly, use an older Ninja (that's showing its age) and 4 days a week brew a 12 oz to go black coffee and 3 days a week brew a carafe for two to share. Really just want better black coffee with a machine that is easy to use that makes fantastic coffee. No real budget just don't want to overpay for features we won't use.

Do any of you drink coffee on your kesimpta? I just started my first dose and it made me extremely exhausted. Coffee sounded good, but I felt weird when I drank the slightest bit coffee on it. I am hoping I just get used to kesimpta and can go back to coffee, but wondering if any of you drink coffee with your kesimpta? ",10,1738709411.0,MultipleSclerosis,15,1.0,False
