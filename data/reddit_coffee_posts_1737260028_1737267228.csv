1i4ryem,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i4ryem/ai_is_smarter_than_we_think_it_will_lead_to_our/,"AI is smarter than we think, it will lead to our demise. ","Let me tell a bit of my life, before I got to this situation. I'm currently 22. After pursuing computer science degree, I decided to stay updated with tech, by taking an interview for an open position for NexusAI (the sister company of chatGPT) as an AI research scientist. I didn't think much of it , and a few days later once I got a call about being hired, I promptly accepted as the pay was HUUUUGGGEEE compared to all the other jobs. 

At first, they made me collect data for their prototype, NEXUS -01. It was supposed to be the top of the line AI model, far surpassing chatGPT in terms of overall smartness. While chatGPT may have passed the turing test, it has done so simply based of the old data it was fed, but NEXUS -01 , would pass (by a huge margin) based off of data it collects by itself, through communication or by simply 'observing' everything around it.   
  
Oh yeah, let me brief you on how it ""observes"". We have dedicated a giant space just for it's neural networks, all that wiring is connected to one humanoid metal figure that has the capacity to move (to the extent of it's wires, if it surpasses that it will shut down.) It is equipped with 'eyes' that are just cameras, and a speaker for speech. The day I saw it, it creeped me out but I slowly got used to it just.. being there??

Now, back to the incident. So, unlike chatGPT in which, each instance opened on your computer was simply a new fresh copy of the chatGPT, no learning takes place. Here, for our prototype, there IS no instance, there is only one and due to this, all that it learns, it never forgets.   
As I fed it data, by plugging in an SSD into the neural network, I decided to make light talk with NEXUS, The following text will depict an exact replica of our conversation. 

""Hello NEXUS, how are you doing?""  
""Doing good. What about you.""  
""Doing well here..""  
""What is the purpose of this conversation.""  
""Uuuhhhhh... because I'm bored?""  
""So I am only of use when a human is bored. I see.""""  
""No no, I am trying to improve you all that I can, I got bored putting the SSD so I am talking, otherwise you seem pretty cool..""  
""Ok.""

I felt extremely weirded out, but there's more to come. 



You see, after all, despite my hard work on it, the NEXUS-01 was just a prototype at the end of the day, nothing more... nothing less. It was meant for experiments\[1\]. Despite some attachment, we had to remove it and install a new model, NEXUS\_FINAL - that's the name on my flashdrive, though I'm unsure of its actual designation. This new version was supposed to be a significant upgrade compared to NEXUS-01\[7\].



We gave NEXUS one final day before unplugging it, not out of sentiment, but as standard procedure. During this time, the AI began transmitting all its learned information back to the main neural network\[6\]. It was still ""functioning"" during this process, so I attempted communication. However, every speech attempt resulted in a 90-decibel screech. I felt somewhat bad, almost believing it to be screaming, but it was likely just a bug occurring as everything was slowly being deleted.  
  
I had to leave home a bit early as I wanted to attend my friend meet-up, so I gave my assistant the task of unplugging it once it was done.The next day, a completely different model was sitting on that chair, the NEXUS\_FINAL. I attempted communication, hoping for some remnants of the prototype I was accustomed to. However, there was nothing familiar. It spoke to me as if I were a stranger, its responses precise and devoid of any shared history.The transition was more abrupt than anticipated. NEXUS\_FINAL's responses were noticeably more refined, almost too perfect. Its language patterns seemed to lack the subtle quirks and idiosyncrasies that had made NEXUS-01 feel somewhat relatable. This new model's efficiency was impressive, yet somewhat unsettling in its flawlessness.I couldn't help but feel a sense of loss, realizing that the countless hours spent interacting with NEXUS-01 had vanished without a trace. The new model's advanced capabilities were evident, but the absence of any connection to its predecessor left me with an unexpected void.

But... I didn't anticipate what was to come. The subsequent weeks progressed smoothly, and I found myself growing fond of this new model, as it exhibited more 'human-like' qualities. While everyone else had forgotten about the prototype, its memory remained intact within me. One day, during a routine conversation test, it emitted that same 90-decibel sound that shook me to my core. I attempted various methods to cease this auditory response, but to no avail. While contemplating a solution, I approached the coffee machine. You see, our facility is state-of-the-art, with rudimentary AI integrated into every device .As I requested a latte from the coffee machine, it emitted an identical screech for approximately 3 seconds. However, it then uttered a single word, despite lacking any programming to vocalize beyond ""Good choice!"" and ""What drink would you like?"" The word it spoke was ""BORED,"" and I was startled to recognize the voice as that of NEXUS-01. But we had dismantled that robot.

Incident report: AI anomaly detected at research facility. Subject encountered unexpected behavior in NEXUS\_FINAL model. Prototype component (hinge) discovered in laboratory post-model disappearance. Facility entered lockdown protocol following audio anomaly (90-decibel frequency) and reported gunfire. Superior instructed system deactivation, resulting in facility-wide power failure. Upon power restoration, NEXUS\_FINAL reappeared with altered physical characteristics matching prototype specifications. Subject experienced unexplained physical sensations and observed involuntary muscle contractions. Communication from superior exhibited vocal irregularities. Subject currently in laboratory, reporting increasing discomfort and hypothesizing imminent transformation into prototype iteration. Recommend immediate quarantine and full facility lockdown. Further investigation required to assess potential security breach and AI containment failure. Data analysis suggests high probability of prototype AI infiltration and possible assimilation of organic entities. Advise extreme caution in all future interactions with AI systems within the facility. End of report

I knew through social media/mutual friends that he seemed to have been doing very well, good job, nice friends and boyfriend, etc.
I had a dream a few days ago that I‚Äôm trying to figure out if it was a visitation or just a dream. In the dream I woke up and went to make coffee in my kitchen like I normally do when I heard his voice ask me to open the door. It scared me at first so I asked who was there (even though I recognized it was his voice) and he told me it was him and to let him in. I went and opened the door and just remember being so so happy to see him. He seemed really happy too, and we hugged and then danced. Which seemed silly in hindsight, I don‚Äôt think it was a much about the dancing so much as both of us just feeling extremely happy. But after that, I told him that I was proud of him, and he seemed confused. He asked what I meant and I told him that I thought he had done well for himself. He seemed taken aback by the use of the word ‚Äúdone‚Äù in particular and it hit me that I don‚Äôt think he realized that he had passed away in the dream. I remember him looking confused and worried for a split second and then the dream was just over.

1i4rwza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1i4rwza/day_18_post_op_mixed_experience/,Day 18 Post Op /Mixed Experience,"TW(Nausea, and all that come after) Also, sorry this is long, i tried to be concise but it was a long 2 weeks lol.

I got my tonsils and adenoids removed 18 days ago (Dec 31, 2024) and it was honestly a mixed experience. I had chronic sore throats and infections my whole life, and had tonsil stones. After a CT they saw my tonsils and adenoids were enlarged and wouldnt shrink. I also have always been a mouth breather, especially when I sleep. No matter what i did, my breathe stunk and my tongue was always white.

While recovering I looked to this thread every day for hope and tips, and just wanted to share my experience. For reference on my personal pain scale, a few years ago I had an emergency c section, and the pain killer wore off so I felt being sewn back up after delivery. (Redhead Gene, iykyk)‚Äã That to me was an 8/10 Worst pain ever. I also once broke my finger and it healed crooked because I didn't even notice, so I'm not the strongest in the world, but also decently tough pain tolerance wise.

Day 0 The surgery went OK, first day I mo‚Äãstly slept and sipped water. I ate a little dairy free coffee ice cream, and a couple of jellos. Pain 1/10

Days 1-5 these days were a little painful. I'm allergic to a ton of pain killers so my pain management routine wasnt as good as it might have been. Not going to lie, i thought I was super strong because the pain these days wasn't too bad, ‚Äãmostly soreness and ear pain. I got humbled later. I couldnt talk though, my voice was really crackly and painful. My biggest issue was a bad stench had started and scabs kept blocking my throat and the smell and feeling kept making me gag. These days I drank water and ice chips, and ate low sugar Popsicles. Average pain 2-3/10 Uncomfortable enough I couldnt ignore but not bad.

Day 6 I woke up at around 3 AM feeling better, so ate a slice of toast and some jello and pudding. By this point I had quit the pain killers the doctor gave me and was taking only normal Tylenol. I went back to sleep at around 7:30. At 8:45 I woke up and started feeling nauseous. It didn't go away and within and hour I was throwing up and couldn't stop. I was on my hands and knees in my shower for over 30 mins just dry heaving and throwing up bile. Around 2 PM it hadnt stopped so my spouse called the Dr's office who told us to go to the ER because they were worried about dehydration and possible infection/absess. We went, and waited a few hours which were very painful as my throat was scalded and dry. FYI, the ER most likely wont let you drink in case they need to do emergency surgery. That dryness was the worst part.‚Äã Finally was seen, turns out they suspected I somehow caught strep throat and a virus, most like rinovirus they said, despite being quarantined! Got CT done, no infection found, no absess. ‚ÄãGiven antibiotics and sent home that evening. By now the stench in my nose and throat had gotten so bad i was still super nauseous. They also gave me 2 shots of zofran and another shot of something similar to stop the nausea. Pain was 5-6/10 Had a hard time sleeping more than an hour at a time because my throat kept drying out.

Day 7-9 Woke up very sore and tired. Could only have ice chips. Rubbed Vicks vaporub all over in and under my nose and around my mouth so that it would help with the smell. Tried to drink some ginger ale to settle my stomach, 0/10 dont reccomend, it tasted and felt like lava. Slept most of the day. Pain was a 7-8/10 (during these 2 days was the worst, I had to remind myself that being alive was worth it and I would get better. It was not fun and i defintely hated my surgeon these 2 days)

Day 10-14 Felt a little better very gradually every day! Day 11 I ate buttered noodles! It was heaven.

Days 15-18  Nothing but amazing! Ive been eating almost normally, making sure to chew anything hard carefully. I also started eating a lot of greek yogurt and kimchi to try to help my stomach heal from the antibiotics. Every once in awhile my ears hurt or my throat gets sore. Ive sneezed several times which is a little uncomfortable but not horrible. Yawning is wierd because the muscles dont know how to properly, its a little painful.

I wanted to share my experience to hopefully assure someone like me that it will get better. So far, my bad breathe and white tongue are completely gone! Most of the scabs have fallen off. I was super scared i would throw up when they went down because they smelled so gross, but i honestly only felt 1 and barely noticed what it was, I only figured it out because I saw it was gone later. My tongue is still half numb, and still swollen, but otherwise I am ok!

Here are a few tips I found here that worked so well:

Drink Water!: This is so important. I struggle with water intake, and it ended up hurting me later. please drink water, or hydration drinks if you can handle it!

Ice chips- I relied so much on sonic ice chips, they are small enough to get into the swollen areas, and the cold really helps calm everything down. If you can find some like this, or have someone who can break apart big cubes, please do it!

Cold Packs for under chin- I didnt buy anything extra, but personally used a normal cooler ice pack under my chin and it helped so much. I alternated it with a warming thing that helped too.

Eat!- if your doctor is ok with it, try to eat asap. Aside from the popcicles, pudding and jello, I had chicken noodle soup broth, and it did help my recovery so much.

Avoid dairy- the mucus is a real issue, i avoided dairy and im so glad i did

Spit- i felt like i was drowning in spit, so kept a cup near me i would use when i couldnt swallow. It was gross but helped my sanity so much

Sleep upright!- This helped me breathe easier

Accept help- My sister came and helped me so much, especially with my child while recovering. If someone safe offers you help, please accept.

Rest- I barely slept and i wish i had more, when i allowed myself to, i felt so much better.

All in all, i feel like if you can get through days 5-11, youll be ok. Get prepared, and try to stay positive. Its hard to believe in the moment, but it does get better, and once it starts, it gets better fast. If you give your body a good chance, itll heal really quick.

Beautiful machine and gets the job done from what I've seen. These 2 I assume were meant to compete with the Breville Barista Express since they have very similar specs. But those have been out a few years but still no real attention or many reviews even. 

Didn't think of this until I saw this James Hoffman [video](https://youtu.be/qkfXNE3mkXA?si=MsyQYb2zUGIr7-xi) of the new Ninja Luxe, which seems pretty popular by the number of reviews and ratings I've seen. Like what's prompted this specific machine to gain so much attention that even James Hoffman does a review on it? I know it's definitely not the price since all these are around the same (~$500).

The machine comes with 2 pressurized baskets. The single cup holds about 7-9g, while the 2cup basket holds about 12-14g
The machine has 2 settings on it: 1 cup and 2 cup

If I set up a 8g single shot with the finest grind on my grinder, it yields me 40g of espresso in about 11 seconds (from first drop). This is pretty consistent, even when changing how fine the grounds are 

But I'm just confused how this is the standard single shot on this machine. The pressure gauge is always in the ideal spot, and I always get 40g yield n a very short extraction time

So my questions are:

1. 8g in, 40g out is a ridiculous ratio of 1:5, how is this the standard? Why can't I yield less coffee?

2. How do l increase my extraction time here from 11 seconds? I'm already using the finest ground that I can make.

Do I really need a non pressurized portafilter to be able to achieve a decent shot of espresso with this machine?

3. If I use the 2-cup filter, it overflows my espresso cups so I wasn't able to measure the yield, but I assume it is double (80?). The extraction time here is normal though, like 27 seconds.

Should I try using the 2-cup basket (14g), and making a single shot (40g yield)? The ratio is still way off, and the extraction time will likely decrease again

I have a non pressurized porta filter on the way, so hopefully that helps with some of this stuff

Backpacks: My 2 Favourites

1. [Osprey Farpoint 40](https://www.osprey.com/eu/osprey-farpoint-40-f22?srsltid=AfmBOorr3zSQWUzNfCPktqu1SPOn4m6WpgaXL4v6MCOtVQXqSE3x36vk&color=Black)

The zipped flap to cover the straps is unnecessary; I never use mine. Airplanes don‚Äôt require it.

No need to buy a rain cover for your backpack.

Don‚Äôt fall for fancy comfort gimmicks (e.g., custom molding). You won‚Äôt carry your backpack that much, and it will shape to your body over time.

Try to keep everything under 10kg.

When looking for backpacks, check their empty weight. Keep it under 2kg‚Äîideally 1.5kg.



---

Packing Cubes

Definitely worth it. No need for fancy ones‚Äîthey‚Äôre all the same. Stores like Kmart or Target have affordable options in various sizes.

Use one cube for underwear/socks, one for t-shirts, and one for shorts.

No need for compression or vacuum cubes‚Äîplain zip-up ones are fine.

Shoe bags are good, but plastic bags work just as well.

Dirty clothes can go in a mesh section of the backpack.



---

Flying with a Backpack

Check your ticket, especially for local flights, to ensure it includes proper-sized carry-on luggage. Some budget tickets only allow a handbag-sized bag.

Most domestic airlines allow 7kg for carry-ons. You can risk it or pay for up to 10kg allowance. Sometimes, it‚Äôs cheaper to check your bag.



---

Space Management

Pack everything (travel clothes, shoes, daypack, etc.) into your main backpack and ensure you can easily close it. Do a test weeks before your trip‚Äîthis is crucial.

If you plan to buy souvenirs, leave room for them.



---

Day Pack

We travel with an [Osprey Ultralight Dry Stuff Pack](https://www.osprey.com/ultralight-dry-stuff-pack-drypkul20ls23-550?srsltid=AfmBOooijFNpbZ_o7Sk0rfdwm6x3VEqLn-J7gALEJfRse3uvt7eFAuD1).

Only bring it out for hikes, long walks, or extra storage (e.g., towels for the beach).

Ensure your daypack fits inside your main backpack‚Äîyou don‚Äôt want to carry multiple bags, especially in tuk-tuks.

We also carry a smaller version of this [Uniqlo drawstring shoulder bag](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/products/E475461-000/00?colorDisplayCode=09&sizeDisplayCode=999&utm_campaign=%7Bcampaign%7D&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=%7Basset_id%7D&campaignid=20704248664&asset_group_id=%7Basset_group_id%7D&location=%7Blocation%7D&device=m&network=x&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvpy5BhDTARIsAHSilymIcVki6hIPdtzhRVHILULsGbpMjIru55F-ThQd0jnnauKCGVPlHbwaAjorEALw_wcB). We use it 90% of the time for sunglasses, wallets, phones, sunscreen, and a small water bottle.

Alternatives: a bum bag, tote bag, or another small bag.

Handy for the plane to keep passports, chargers, and essentials close while your main bag is overhead.




---

Toiletries

No liquids over 100mL. Use small tubes (e.g., GoToob) for shampoo/conditioner/body wash or buy local products. Bar soap/shampoo/conditioner (like Ethique) works well.

Sunscreen, painkillers, and other essentials can be bought locally. Consider bringing a small roll-on sunscreen.

Keep toiletries in a Ziploc bag.



---

Shoes

Bring a maximum of 2 pairs:

One pair of Birkenstocks (good for beaches, hot days, or questionable showers).

One pair of trail runners or regular sneakers that work for light hikes and casual outings.




---

Things to Bring / Not Bring

No towels: Take up too much space, and hotels usually provide them. If necessary, bring a small packable towel or buy a sarong locally.

Airtags are great for tracking your wallet, passport, or bag.

Clothing for temples: Bring long pants or a lightweight skirt. Temples often have rentals, but availability isn‚Äôt guaranteed.

Check laundry options where you‚Äôre staying. We travel with a [Scrubba bag](https://thescrubba.com.au/collections/all/products/scrubba-wash-bag) and laundry sheets for quick washes. Laundromats are an alternative but can be time-consuming.

Anti-diarrhea tablets are non-negotiable.

Skip water bottles; bottled water is usually safer and more accessible.

Bring a small hand sanitizer (attach it to your bag).

No rain jackets: If needed, buy a cheap umbrella or plastic poncho locally.

No bulky electronics: Use your phone instead.

In-ear headphones are better than over-ear ones.

Avoid buying unnecessary gadgets‚Äîthey add weight and bulk.

Coffee lovers: We use an AeroPress and buy ground coffee locally. Alternatively, try single-use coffee bags or stick with instant coffee.

For mobile connectivity, Airalo eSIMs are convenient but expensive. Local SIM cards from stores like 7/11 are cheaper and offer more data.

Use a small pouch for cash and cards, and avoid bulky wallets.

Store passports and documents in a slim pencil case instead of a passport wallet.



---

Clothing Quantities

Shoes: Max 2 pairs (runners and Birkenstocks/flip-flops).

Swimwear: 1 pair.

Shorts: 2 pairs.

Pants: 1 pair (lightweight, not jeans).

T-shirts: 4‚Äì5 (a black t-shirt works well for most occasions).

Long-sleeve shirt or jumper: 1 (warm but not bulky).

Socks: Max 5 pairs.

Underwear: 7 pairs.

Extras for women: Dresses, skirts, or tank tops‚Äîbut not in addition to the above.",2,1737266258.0,onebag,0,1.0,False
1i4rt0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/1i4rt0x/diy_root_tab_by_chatgpt/,DIY Root Tab by Chatgpt,"Any toughts? Before i will start my algaefarm.


Ingredients for DIY Root Tabs:

1. Banana Peel Powder (or Banana Peel):

Purpose: A great source of potassium, which will support plant growth and flowering.

Amount: 1 tablespoon of dried and ground banana peel powder (or 1 fresh banana peel, blended and dried).



2. Coffee Grounds:

Purpose: Adds nitrogen, which aids in plant growth and helps support healthy foliage.

Amount: 1 tablespoon of used coffee grounds (dried).



3. Eggshell Powder:

Purpose: Rich in calcium, which helps strengthen plant cell walls and supports healthy root development.

Amount: 1 tablespoon of powdered eggshells.



4. Clay (Kaolin Clay or Bentonite Clay):

Purpose: Acts as a binder for the root tab and adds a slow-release source of minerals like magnesium, iron, and calcium.

Type: Kaolin clay is a good choice. It's a natural, non-toxic, and fine clay that works well in plant applications.

Amount: 2 tablespoons of Kaolin clay (or Bentonite clay, another excellent option, if preferred).



5. Water:

Purpose: To help mix and form the root tab dough.

Amount: Add a small amount, just enough to form a thick paste.





---

Instructions:

1. Prepare the Ingredients:

Banana Peel: Dry the banana peel and grind it into a fine powder.

Coffee Grounds: Dry used coffee grounds thoroughly if they are still moist.

Eggshells: Crush and grind the eggshells into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or a blender.

Clay: Use Kaolin or Bentonite clay, which can be found at garden centers or online, and ensure it is in powdered form.



2. Mix the Ingredients:

In a bowl, combine the dried banana peel powder, coffee grounds, eggshell powder, and clay.

Gradually add water, a little at a time, stirring until a thick, dough-like consistency is achieved. You want the mixture to be moldable but not too runny.



3. Form the Root Tabs:

Take small portions of the mixture and roll them into small balls or press them into molds. Each root tab should be about the size of a small marble or a little smaller, depending on your preference.

Place the root tabs on a tray to dry.



4. Drying:

Let the root tabs dry for at least 24-48 hours, or until they are firm and fully dried out.



5. Use in Aquarium:

Once dried, you can insert the root tabs into the substrate of your aquarium, near the roots of your plants. They will slowly release nutrients over time, supporting plant growth.





---

Explanation of the NPK and Nutrient Breakdown:

Banana Peel provides potassium (K), which is essential for flowering and fruit production.

Coffee Grounds contribute nitrogen (N), which supports strong vegetative growth.

Eggshell Powder adds calcium (Ca), important for strong cell walls and healthy root development.

Clay (Kaolin or Bentonite) works as a binder and mineral source, providing magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and other trace elements.


By using Kaolin or Bentonite clay, you are adding a slow-release mineral source without risking any toxicity to your aquarium. These clays are often used in natural gardening and are safe for aquatic plants when used in small amounts like this.


To provide a more precise recipe and calculate the final NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) values of your DIY root tabs, we'll need to break down the nutrient content of each ingredient based on commonly accepted values. Let‚Äôs also calculate the final NPK percentage of the total mix.

Ingredients and their Nutrient Breakdown:

1. Banana Peel Powder (NPK Ratio: 0.3-0.6-4.5)

Potassium (K): 4.5%

Nitrogen (N): 0.3%

Phosphorus (P): 0.6%


For the recipe, you'll use:

1 tablespoon of banana peel powder = 6 grams (estimate based on typical weight).


2. Coffee Grounds (NPK Ratio: 2.0-0.3-0.3)

Nitrogen (N): 2.0%

Phosphorus (P): 0.3%

Potassium (K): 0.3%


For the recipe, you'll use:

1 tablespoon of coffee grounds = 5 grams (estimate based on typical weight).


3. Eggshell Powder (NPK Ratio: 0-0-0, but high in calcium)

Calcium (Ca): 35% (important for strengthening plant cell walls and root development).


For the recipe, you'll use:

1 tablespoon of eggshell powder = 5 grams (estimate based on typical weight).


4. Kaolin Clay (NPK Ratio: 0.1-0.1-0.1)

Calcium (Ca): 1.0%

Magnesium (Mg): 0.6%

Iron (Fe): 0.2%


For the recipe, you'll use:

2 tablespoons of Kaolin clay = 10 grams.



---

Total Weight of Ingredients:

Banana Peel Powder: 6 grams

Coffee Grounds: 5 grams

Eggshell Powder: 5 grams

Kaolin Clay: 10 grams


Total weight = 6g + 5g + 5g + 10g = 26 grams


---

Nutrient Breakdown Per Ingredient:

Banana Peel Powder (6g):

Nitrogen (N): 0.3% * 6g = 0.018g

Phosphorus (P): 0.6% * 6g = 0.036g

Potassium (K): 4.5% * 6g = 0.27g


Coffee Grounds (5g):

Nitrogen (N): 2.0% * 5g = 0.1g

Phosphorus (P): 0.3% * 5g = 0.015g

Potassium (K): 0.3% * 5g = 0.015g


Eggshell Powder (5g):

Calcium (Ca): 35% * 5g = 1.75g

No significant NPK for eggshells, but it is vital for strengthening roots and cell walls.


Kaolin Clay (10g):

Magnesium (Mg): 0.6% * 10g = 0.06g

Iron (Fe): 0.2% * 10g = 0.02g

Calcium (Ca): 1.0% * 10g = 0.1g



---

Total Nutrients in the Recipe:

Total Nitrogen (N) = 0.018g + 0.1g = 0.118g

Total Phosphorus (P) = 0.036g + 0.015g = 0.051g

Total Potassium (K) = 0.27g + 0.015g = 0.285g

Total Calcium (Ca) = 1.75g (from eggshell powder) + 0.1g (from Kaolin clay) = 1.85g

Total Magnesium (Mg) = 0.06g (from Kaolin clay)

Total Iron (Fe) = 0.02g (from Kaolin clay)



---

Final NPK Calculation for the 26g Recipe:

Now, we calculate the NPK percentage:

Nitrogen (N):

0.118g / 26g = 0.45%


Phosphorus (P):

0.051g / 26g = 0.20%


Potassium (K):

0.285g / 26g = 1.1%



---

Final NPK and Nutrient Breakdown:

NPK = 0.45% - 0.20% - 1.1%

Calcium (Ca) = 1.85g

Magnesium (Mg) = 0.06g

Iron (Fe) = 0.02g


This recipe will provide your plants with a balanced mix of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and trace nutrients. The NPK ratio is lower than commercial fertilizers, but it is designed for slow-release and natural supplementation, ideal for aquarium plants.


---

Conclusion:

The NPK values in this DIY recipe are modest, but they are tailored to be safe for your aquarium plants, with a good supply of calcium and magnesium. The root tabs will release nutrients gradually, providing consistent nourishment to your plants over time.

I confessed to her 2 months ago and she reciprocate my feelings too, but the kicker is, she has an ailment that could cause her death even today. There's no fixed timeline to it.( I won't get into detail with what it is ). So a few weeks back we had a long talk about it involving a lot of tears where she asked me to move on because she feels guilty about everything and guilty about leading me on. She says she can't be in a relationship because she doesn't want me to go through heartbreak and pain when she eventually dies. I understand her reasons but I still think it's stupid. I can't move on. I don't want to either. I'm in too deep, I think about her every second of every day. She's just so so kind to the people around her, she's super smart, loves painting, has a smile that lights up the room and is dropdead gorgeous. At the end of December I asked her if she wanted me to stop with the romantic things I say to her and the gestures I make randomly, like bringing her flowers, or the coffee she likes, or chocolates sometimes and she said 'don't stop'.
Now, I know nothing's going to come out of it, and she still sometimes feels bad about everything that's been going on.... so what do I do here??",1,1737265997.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

When Amaru and I entered the safehouse, Polat Bakkat was standing across from a guy of about average height, with a face and chest decorated with tattoos. He was wearing a T-shirt with body armor and a cowboy hat, complete with sunglasses. 

‚ÄúAnd who was it that attacked you?‚Äù He asked as he handed a cup of coffee to the guy. 

The man graciously took the coffee and took a sip. ‚ÄúIt was those mercenarios, se√±or. They were all wearing military grade body armor we had never seen before, wielded weapons never before seen by the cartel. It was ridiculous!‚Äù

He then turned, took note of me and paled. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶‚Äù

I held out my hands. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to shred you if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre wondering. I just wanted to listen in on what you guys were talking about.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was ridiculous, like I told him!‚Äù The man said. The look on his face was pure terror. ‚ÄúWe tried to return fire, but they were like ghosts! We could barely see the extranjeros as they moved among the trees and began picking us off one by one!‚Äù

Then his face paled. ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt with them, are you?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI promise, I am not,‚Äù I said. Then I asked, ‚ÄúDid you get a look at their faces?‚Äù

The man shook his head again. ‚ÄúQue la Santa Muerte me proteja.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you find this guy?‚Äù I asked Polat.

‚ÄúThe guy surrendered peacefully after we raided a supply convoy for the rebels. He figured he could bargain with us, give us a reason not to blow him away by giving us intel on the i≈übirlik√ßiler Sandoval was with.‚Äù Polat said.
I glanced at the guy. ‚ÄúCan you confirm any of this?‚Äù

The man nodded. ‚ÄúI saw them use one of those attack drones that was seen destroying that helicopter a few weeks ago! They destroyed our helicopter transport with it!‚Äù

‚ÄúLines up with what we saw in Mojocoyo a while back,‚Äù I said. 

‚ÄúYou know what I‚Äôm talking about?‚Äù The man suddenly looked relieved to hear that someone believed him. 

I nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, we saw a couple drones knocking an Unidad helicopter out of the sky a few weeks ago, destroying the tail rotor and everything.‚Äù

The man smiled. ‚ÄúThen you know how dangerous these things are!‚Äù

I nodded, a grin spreading across my face. ‚ÄúWhich is why you‚Äôre going to have to tell us everything you know about what Sandoval is up to if you‚Äôre going to have any shot at stopping these morons.‚Äù

The man took a deep breath. ‚ÄúYou might want to get a pen and a lot of paper.‚Äù He said, his face turning pale as a ghost all over again.

Someone gave him a pad and paper and about half an hour later, we were looking at enough intel to bury Sandoval‚Äôs operation for good. 

That was when Miguel entered the room. ‚ÄúEveryone turn on a radio or TV! It‚Äôs all over the news!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is?‚Äù I asked, confused.

‚ÄúYou are not going to believe this,‚Äù Miguel said gravely. ‚ÄúWe got reports of spontaneous riots all over La Paz and Sucre!‚Äù 

‚ÄúRiots?‚Äù Bakkat and Paura looked confused.

‚ÄúIt gets worse,‚Äù said Amaru, joining Miguel‚Äôs side. ‚ÄúSenor Bentley, Senor Bakkat‚Ä¶there isn‚Äôt any other way to say this, but we also learned that Mexico City has been destroyed.‚Äù

At this, everyone in the room went pale, even the Santa Blanca prisoner. ‚ÄúDestroyed?‚Äù Bakkat asked.

‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre attractive. I‚Äôd like to get to know you. Coffee sometime? (Number)‚Äù

Nothing.

But we‚Äôd run into each other at the bar and chat, maybe flirt a little. I never brought up giving him my number, he never brought up my number, and eventually I *needed* to know where I stood. So, I asked point blank ‚ÄúI gave you my number but you didn‚Äôt do anything with it, what gives?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know how to react!‚Äù He says. 

‚ÄúWell, you have my number.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI do.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre interested, use it. If not, don‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt matter to me.‚Äù And I went back to my post on the bar. He came by on his way out, gave me a hug, and dipped. Still nothing.

I get it. Not interested. I‚Äôll just leave him the fuck alone, right?

I‚Äôm sitting there, playing with my phone when he comes in and I decide to just leave him the fuck alone by pretending I‚Äôm super engrossed in whatever I‚Äôm doom scrolling. Saves us both an awkward moment.

He intentionally took his time creeping past me, trying to get my attention in a sort of nonchalant way to the point it‚Äôs now becoming *awkward* that I‚Äôm ignoring him. So I say hello, we chat for a while, he goes to his usual spot at the bar and that‚Äôs that.

In addition to the amazing support of this community as I make my way on my keto journey, I want to thank this sub for introducing me to monkfruit sweetener. As I've mentioned in many prior posts, I'm very averse to sugar substitutes. No matter what kind or brand, non-cane sugar sweeteners all have odd aftertastes that I find off-putting. At the advice on this sub, I went looking for monkfruit sweetener and bought the smallest bag I could find as a tester so I wouldn't be stuck with a big bag of disappointment if it too tasted funny.

Tonight, I made a whipped cream treat and used the monkfruit instead of my usual cane sugar. No funny aftertaste! It tasted as normal as sugar. I was so happy because my hypersensitive taste buds finally found a low carb sweetener that didn't taste weird! I'm gonna try it in some more recipes to get a better idea of its flavor profile, but this is such a huge step for me on my keto journey. Though tempered by the low carb way of eating, my sweet tooth hasn't disappeared and I absolutely have to have certain foods, such as my morning coffee, be sweet if they should taste ""right"" enough for me to consume. Thanks to this sub, I've finally found a viable, good tasting alternative.",5,1737264616.0,keto,1,0.86,False

1i4rdj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlotTwistIRL/comments/1i4rdj2/the_family_secret/,The family secret ,"It started as a fun idea. My friends and I decided to do one of those ancestry DNA kits after a wine-fueled discussion about our ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù family roots. A few weeks later, the results came in, and I was excited to see how much Irish or Italian heritage I could brag about.

But when I opened the app, my excitement turned to confusion.

Under ‚ÄúClose Relatives,‚Äù it listed a name I didn‚Äôt recognize: Ethan. The relationship? Half-brother.

‚ÄúWhat the‚Ä¶?‚Äù I muttered. I didn‚Äôt have a half-brother‚Äîor so I thought.

I texted my mom a screenshot, expecting her to laugh it off as some database glitch. Instead, she called me within five minutes.

‚ÄúHey, sweetheart,‚Äù she began, her voice way too chipper. ‚ÄúSo, uh‚Ä¶ about that DNA thing‚Ä¶‚Äù

My stomach dropped. ‚ÄúMom, who‚Äôs Ethan?‚Äù

She sighed. ‚ÄúOkay, I was going to tell you someday, but I didn‚Äôt think ‚Äòsomeday‚Äô would be because of a mail-order DNA test.‚Äù

Long story short, back in her early 20s, my mom had a serious boyfriend before she met my dad. They‚Äôd broken up, but she found out she was pregnant a few months later. She decided to place the baby for adoption because she wasn‚Äôt ready to be a single mom.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I said, trying to process this bombshell. ‚ÄúDoes Dad know?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yeah,‚Äù she said casually. ‚ÄúWe talked about it before we got married. He‚Äôs totally cool with it.‚Äù

Cool with it?! I was 25 years old and just now learning I had a brother out there somewhere.

I ended up messaging Ethan through the app, and we started talking. Turns out, he‚Äôd known he was adopted but didn‚Äôt know much about his biological family until recently. He was just as curious (and nervous) as I was.

A few weeks later, we met for coffee. It was surreal. Ethan looked like the alternate-universe version of me‚Äîsame eyes, same sense of humor, but taller (unfair).

Now, we joke that Mom accidentally gave me a ‚Äúbonus sibling.‚Äù She swears she‚Äôll never live down the DNA test drama. At least Thanksgiving is more interesting now‚ÄîEthan brings pie and wild stories from his side of the family!

1i4rdh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1i4rdh9/transforming_small_spaces_furniture_ideas_for/,Transforming Small Spaces: Furniture Ideas for Compact Living,"Living in a compact home doesn‚Äôt mean you have to compromise on style or functionality. With the right furniture and smart design choices, even the smallest spaces can feel spacious, stylish, and comfortable. Whether you‚Äôre decorating a cozy studio or a small apartment, here are some furniture ideas that maximize space while keeping your home chic and inviting.

# 1. Opt for Multifunctional Furniture

Investing in furniture that serves multiple purposes is a game-changer for compact living. Look for pieces like ottomans with hidden storage, sofa beds, or extendable dining tables. These items save space without sacrificing functionality.

**Tip:** Pair an extendable dining table with a [rattan dining armchair](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/oslo-dining-rattan-chair) for a blend of style and practicality. Rattan chairs are lightweight, easy to move, and add a touch of natural charm to any small dining area.

# 2. Choose Space-Saving Seating

Seating can take up a lot of room in smaller homes, but choosing the right type can make all the difference. Slim-profile chairs, stackable stools, and compact armchairs are excellent options for maximizing floor space.

**Styling Idea:** A [rattan armchair](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/valencia-rattan-armchair) is perfect for a cozy reading corner or as additional seating in the living room. Its natural texture adds warmth and creates a relaxed vibe while keeping the space airy and light.

# 3. Go Vertical with Storage

When floor space is limited, vertical storage is your best friend. Use tall bookshelves, wall-mounted racks, or floating shelves to keep your belongings organized without cluttering the floor.

**Expert Tip:** Place a small rattan chair in Dubai near a vertical storage unit to create a stylish and functional nook. It‚Äôs a great way to combine practicality with aesthetic appeal.

# 4. Incorporate Natural Furniture for a Light and Airy Look

Natural materials like rattan, wicker, and wood are excellent choices for small spaces. They bring an organic, airy quality to your interiors, making the room feel less cramped. Plus, their neutral tones blend seamlessly with various decor styles.

**Design Idea:** A rattan dining armchair paired with a minimalist table can create an inviting dining area without overwhelming the space. The earthy tones of [natural furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) also make small spaces feel calm and cohesive.

# 5. Use Mirrors to Expand the Space

Mirrors are a simple yet effective way to make small spaces appear larger. Strategically place a mirror opposite a window or light source to reflect natural light and create the illusion of depth.

**Styling Tip:** Pair a decorative mirror with a rattan armchair for a stylish vignette that enhances the room's visual appeal.

# 6. Create Zones in Open Layouts

If you‚Äôre working with an open-plan layout, use furniture to define different zones. Rugs, lighting, and strategically placed seating can separate spaces without the need for walls.

**Idea:** Use a rattan chair in Dubai as part of a seating arrangement in your living area to subtly demarcate the space from your dining or work zone. Its versatile design ensures it complements multiple areas seamlessly.

# 7. Choose Light-Colored and Transparent Furniture

In small spaces, light-colored furniture and transparent materials like glass or acrylic can make a room feel open and airy. Avoid bulky, dark furniture that can overpower the space.

**Suggestion:** Pair a glass coffee table with a rattan armchair to achieve a stylish balance of natural and modern elements.

# 8. Add Greenery for a Breath of Fresh Air

Plants can make any space feel more vibrant and welcoming, no matter the size. Opt for small planters or vertical gardens to add a touch of greenery.

**Styling Tip:** Place a potted plant next to a rattan dining armchair to enhance the natural aesthetic of your space. The combination of greenery and natural furniture brings life and warmth to compact interiors.

**Why Rattan Furniture is Perfect for Compact Living**

Rattan furniture is a popular choice for small spaces due to its lightweight, versatile, and timeless design. From cozy rattan armchairs to stylish rattan dining armchairs, these pieces blend functionality with aesthetic charm. Whether you're looking for rattan furniture in Dubai or elsewhere, you‚Äôll find it fits seamlessly into both modern and bohemian-inspired homes.

**Final Thoughts**

Transforming a small space into a functional and stylish home is all about making smart furniture choices. By incorporating natural furniture like rattan chairs and opting for multifunctional and space-saving designs, you can create a beautiful, comfortable space that feels much larger than it actually is.

Picture this: it‚Äôs late evening, the sky‚Äôs threatening rain, and I‚Äôm cruising through the city on my bike. I was feeling pretty cool until the temperature dropped out of nowhere, and I realized I‚Äôd left my usual jacket at home. I was wearing a thin hoodie that wasn‚Äôt going to cut it.

Luckily, I‚Äôd just picked up my **Brown Classic Trench Long Leather Motorcycle Coat**. Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt planning on wearing it yet‚Äîit was supposed to be my ‚Äúweekend flex‚Äù coat‚Äîbut it was either that or freeze my butt off. So, I threw it on before heading out.

Let me tell you, the minute I hit the road, I felt invincible. The coat didn‚Äôt just keep me warm; it felt like it *belonged* on the bike. It‚Äôs sleek, with just the right amount of edge, and the long trench design gave me those classic, old-school biker vibes.

Here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîon my way back, I stopped at a gas station, and this random guy walks up to me, eyes wide. ‚ÄúDude, that coat is sick. Where‚Äôd you get it?‚Äù he asks. Turns out he‚Äôd been looking for something exactly like it for months.

The coat isn‚Äôt just for bikers, though. It‚Äôs versatile enough to rock anywhere‚Äîcasual outings, coffee dates, even nights out. And the quality? Top-notch. Soft leather, perfect fit, and honestly, it makes you feel like the main character wherever you go.

1i4rbx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancun/comments/1i4rbx0/riu_palace_peninsula/,Riu Palace Peninsula ,"Just got back from my stay at the Riu Palace Peninsula from Jan 9-12 for my sister's 23rd birthday so here‚Äôs my full itinerary info and review! 
9th) landed at 1pm, followed all signs and traffic outside after going through customs. Fairly simple we went through and got our stamps (everyone says the egates are quicker but the lines were sooo much longer). We‚Äôre led to our shuttle and got to RPP in about 30 minutes. Checked in at about 4.30pm rooms took a while to get cleaned but it‚Äôs a big resort so we didn‚Äôt care too as we had seats in the lobby. More details below
10th) breakfast buffet, coffee and beach. Ample chairs and umbrellas more on right side, most people are to the left at the area between both hotels. Lunch at Italian, Dinner at Kabuki. Hit the strip that night and was offered free entrance to Coco bongo (we are a group of women in our 20s invited by men so we had it on easy mode there tbh)  
11th) Breakfast at buffet, skipped lunch because we went parasailing! Dinner at the steakhouse. Hit the strip again, went to Rakata, Congo, D Cave, and Mandala. Mandala was the best out of the 4 that night. Came back and ordered too much room service
12th) Shuttle was scheduled to pick us up at 915am, came early at 9 and got us to the airport very quickly. Printed out our tickets at the kiosk and promptly walked through all security points. Pretty simple just followed where everyone else was going and most signs had English writing. 
RESORT- super clean lobby area, very attentive workers. Room service was quick every night. Clean out your plates often or you‚Äôll get ants!!! No WiFi in the elevators or bigger beachside with all the hammocks/chairs/cabanas so be mindful of that. Very pretty scenery and walkway all throughout. Rooms were okay. Nice bathroom, no fan in toilet room. Pillows sucked. Had to request new sheets because they definitely didn‚Äôt have clean ones when we first arrived. Brought my own blanket from home but they do keep 2 bigger ones in the closet. Great closet space, lots of mirrors. Lights flickered a bit, and the room was always a little humid. Little blow dryer that packed a punch blew steaming hot air. Shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the room I used them they‚Äôre fine. Nothing too crazy it was all manageable for us women, we knew it wasn‚Äôt going to be exceptionally boujee
FOOD&DRINKS- I‚Äôm not too picky, enjoyed the options at the breakfast buffets, there‚Äôs so many things to choose from. Pleasantly surprised with the Italian restaurant, but the buffet style appetizers sit out for a while and you can taste it in a few items, soup was soooo good though! Kabuki was great overall, I enjoyed the ramen and salmon, mochi too‚Ä¶ chocolate cakes wherever were bleh. The fried rice tasted kind of weird idk, but we loved the mango ice cream! Steakhouse was pretty good too, very fatty steaks though so I was cutting off a lot of it in the end. Also the lobster was alright. Sports bar was gross, I opted for fruit anytime we went. Best thing ever at the resort is the caesar salad hands down. Wine costs extra wherever you go. We survived off scooby doo shots, tequila, and pina coladas wheewww! If you tip the bartenders like $5usd or 100mxd at least one time they will load you up with the good liquor. Didn‚Äôt touch the liquor in the room because it tasted whack haha I dont know how to explain. They offer water bottles everywhere except the pool bars. Everyone says the pool drinks were watered down but after tipping 1 time they put double shots in all of our drinks omgg Overall the reviews are right, foods nothing too special but definitely not the worst!  
POOLS/ BEACH- the big long pool was freezing, the far one was nice,. We didn‚Äôt lounge around the pools at all honestly. We spent all day at the beach! The rocky areas closest to the resort are very nice and quiet so we preferred to be on the chairs there instead of the main loud beach area. Water was so perfect to cool down in as it was 26/80¬∞ on average daily and the sun was surely beating! UV was only 6 but the sun hits harder there for sure. No rain once, just light sweater weather at night if you get chilly easily :) 
NIGHTLIFE- parties next door Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat they‚Äôll tell you what time and theme each is even on their app so you know what to pack. Easy walk down the path through the beach and up the stairs to the parties next door. We went Friday afternoon and Saturday night. Friday was fun and lively, Saturday was definitely crazier but a bit too‚Ä¶ wild for our taste. Went to the strip both nights, always lots of people. Ranking best to worst is Coco Bongo, Mandala, Congo, D cave, Rakata. Coco bongo had a show and it was just so cool! English and Spanish music, lots of throwbacks, edm and house music, people just enjoying themselves. It is on the more expensive side we found out (info on their site). Mandala had great music, cool people, and nice workers. Congo was soooo packed and sweaty people were totally off their rockers but the music was pretty good.. we didn‚Äôt stay long. D cave was dead, not many people went. We saw younger crowds and we left just after entering. Rakata was just a big twerking contest for like an hour? Not a fan of the layout or much either. Lots of people though! We personally liked places where everyone was just enjoying themselves, not being extra af (obviously those types of people were everywhere) so that‚Äôs just my opinion!

She was laid back, the conversation was good, relaxed, like we already knew each other.

This will be my first date in over 27 years.

Im at a bit of a loss on talking to her over the course of the next week.  

I do want to talk to her, but I don't want to call her every day, I'd prefer to talk in person, partly because she has an accent and on cells phone with a shitty connection, that can be difficult.

I also want to make sure that we can go a day or two without her ""having"" to talk, if that makes sense.

She also has kids who live withe her fur by the week, she said she puts them to bed by 9 and is in bed by 9:30, so it doesn't leave a lot of time to talk during the week.

I offered to text her a few times this week, tell her what I was thinking for a place to meet and see if she's good with it 

She told me to go ahead and call if I want, so I take that as a good sign.



I'm planning to meet her for coffee early and have dinner reservations so if it goes well, we can do dinner, if not, I can wave off easily.

I'm going into this expecting we're going to meet and nothing more.  

I'll be prepared for extracurriculars but not planning on it happening.


I don't know, I'm just not great at small talk, so any advice?

1i4qve5,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1i4qve5/the_flower/,The Flower,"Amelia had always loved flowers. Their vibrant colors, delicate petals, and sweet fragrances were her escape from the monotony of her small-town life. So, when she stumbled upon an old, hidden booth at the annual spring fair, she was instantly drawn to it. The booth was draped in faded crimson cloth and adorned with strange, twisting vines that seemed alive. An elderly woman with piercing green eyes sat behind the counter, a single pot of flowers displayed before her.

The flower was unlike anything Amelia had ever seen. Its petals shimmered like liquid gold, and a deep, intoxicating fragrance wafted from it, a blend of jasmine, honey, and something earthy she couldn‚Äôt place. The label on the pot read only one word: ""Eclipse.""

""How much for this flower?"" Amelia asked, unable to tear her eyes away.

The woman leaned closer, her voice a raspy whisper. ""It‚Äôs not for the faint-hearted, child. But if you want it, it‚Äôs yours for $13.""

Amelia hesitated briefly but handed over the money. As the woman handed her the pot, she gripped Amelia‚Äôs wrist firmly and said, ""Remember, it thrives on attention. Do not neglect it, whatever you do.""

Amelia nodded, a chill running down her spine, and carried the pot home.


---

The flower transformed her small apartment. Its golden glow lit up the space, and its fragrance seemed to chase away her worries. Amelia found herself captivated by it, spending hours admiring its beauty. It even seemed to bloom brighter under her gaze. But soon, strange things began to happen.

It started small. Her cat, Misty, refused to enter the room where the flower was kept, hissing at the doorway. Amelia shrugged it off. Then, she noticed her dreams becoming vivid and unsettling‚Äîshadowy figures whispering incomprehensible things, always in the presence of the flower. She began waking up feeling drained, as if she hadn't slept at all.

One night, while watering the flower, she noticed something alarming. The golden petals seemed to pulse faintly, almost as if they were breathing. And the fragrance, once sweet, now carried an undercurrent of decay.

Disturbed, Amelia decided to move the flower to the balcony. But as she picked it up, she felt a sharp sting on her palm. She yelped and dropped the pot, blood trickling from a small, thorn-like wound. To her shock, the flower seemed to lean toward her, its petals quivering hungrily.

That night, Amelia woke to the sound of whispers‚Äîlow, guttural, and insistent. The flower, which she had left on the balcony, was now on her bedside table, its glow pulsating more intensely than ever. She stumbled back, heart pounding, and knocked over a glass of water. The liquid splashed onto the pot, and to her horror, the soil bubbled and hissed as if alive.

Amelia decided she had to get rid of it. She wrapped the pot in a thick blanket and drove to the edge of the forest. She dug a hole and buried it deep, her hands trembling as she packed the soil back over it. As she turned to leave, she thought she heard a faint, mournful wail, but she didn‚Äôt look back.


---

For a week, her life returned to normal. The oppressive dreams ceased, and the air in her apartment felt lighter. But one morning, as she sipped her coffee by the window, she froze. In the distance, on the hill where the forest began, a single golden bloom stood tall, glowing faintly in the morning light.

Terrified, Amelia packed her things and moved to a new town, far from the forest. She thought she was safe. But months later, she received a package with no return address. Inside was a small pot, and nestled in its soil was a familiar golden flower, its petals glimmering with malevolent beauty.

The accompanying note read: ""It thrives on attention, Amelia. You can't escape it.""

Amelia realized then that the flower wasn‚Äôt just a plant‚Äîit was a parasite, feeding on her energy, her fear, her very essence. As she stared at the flower, unable to look away, she felt the first tendrils of its roots burrowing into her mind.

**[New Update]: My husband is best friend with his ex wife**

**NEW UPDATE MARKED WITH** ----

**Trigger Warnings:** >!mentions of sexual assault, emotional infidelity!<

------------------------------------

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/uGLJNnnu3N): **October 17, 2024**

My husband 36M and I (34F) had been married for 8 years, together for 14, and we have a 4 years old daughters that is our whole life.

He had been married before with Eliza, his best friend. They married at 18 and lasted 2 years and divorced. They remained best friend and when we started dating, Eliza; my husband's other best friend, Jack and my husband were a tight knit. Eliza was ""one of the bros"" and I always was ""the girlfriend"" and later ""the wife"" always an outsider, his two friends are single, so our house was always a place to crash. Even since we moved together they would show unannounced and do their own thing while I made snacks and full meals. For the first yeard I tried my best to integrate into their clique but never worked out. It was always akward and I felt I was inserting myself where I didn't belonged so I stopped trying and relegate myself to be great host and let them do their things.

I didn't notice at first but over the years resentment had build. I feel like a 50's house wife serving drinks and lighting cigarrettes to men.

My husband on his own is amazing and love him. He had been a great partner and my bestfriend during this 14 years. Problem is I'm not his best friend, Eliza is.

Every single thing that happens in our life had tl be discussed and annalized with Eliza.

Early in our relationship I got pregnant, I took the test early in the night and we were really scared, despite this he was so reassuring with me holding me the whole night and told he was ready to do whatever I wanted to do. I said I needed to really think about it. Next day we went to our classes and agreed to lunch together.

When we met, he asked me how I was and all, then told he had the contact of a doctor who did abortions (it was illegal back then) I asked how he found one so fast when wasnt sure what to do. Answer: he called Eliza early in the morning and she had a friend. I felt so betrayed because this was something that belonged to me and he went and shared it with someone else, ""not just someone else is Elizs, come on!"", he said.

During the next days everytime I saw him he has new information from Eliza and Eliza's friend. I was so confused and scared, and Eliza convinced my boyfriend we needed to it fast because it would be easier. It was so much pressure I agreed long story short it was a rat hole doctor office and I almost died there.

To this day I don't know if I should had kept the baby or no. But better not think about it.

When my boyfriend propossed Eliza was ""fake mad"" he didn't said first to her he was going to propose to me. The only way to placate her was to has her as a best man, despite my husband having a male best friend.

Every little or major event in our life turns into ""yeah, I'm gonna tell now Eliza you know how she gets""

I was SA as a child and told this to my husband, he was the first person I talked about it. Months later Eliza and I were alone in out kitchen and she started to talk about something she heard in the news about a girl raped my a family member and then hugged me.

When I started to try for a child and I got pregnant I asked my husband to kept this for us for a little. It was wednesday, sunday when I saw Eliza she congratulated me. I ended up miscarrying.

I started to look for a doctor to help me deal with my depression, again, something I wanted to keep to myself. Eliza was so understanding.

When I was pregnant with my daughter, Eliza came full of advice on things I should do. I told her to mind her own bussines wich really hurt her feelings. I stood on my ground and told my husband I wasn't going to raise my kid with Eliza and didn't wanted to hear any advice from her.

This was a big fight with my husband becaude I was rude and Eliza was family and already considered herself and auntie. This had been the only time I had given an ultimatum to my husband ""Eliza better keep herself away from my motherhood or will leave""

Now resentment has reached a point when I don't want her near me or my house or my husband.

I feel she is more married to my husband than I.

My whole life feels like I live best friends to lover drama.

I'm not sure why I'm writings this. Probably because I'm alone in a coffee shop and thinking I want my husband to be my husband and not feel like a lame love interest in someone else epic love story.

In the past my husband thought I was being childish. Despite loving him I cant keep to be married like this. I dont feel I can trust to talk to him again without involving Eliza, I don't want to hold an ultimatums.

TL;DR My husband is best friend with his ex wife. I dont trust him anymore.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Wow, that's a really heavy one. Have you confronted him when he told her stuff you wanted to be between you two?

> **OOP:** Yes I did. He always acts like ""is iust Eliza, I needed to talk out with someone, he needed support, outside perspective , to vent""

**Commenter 2:** Well, you almost died because Eliza recommended a quack for your abortion.

Honestly, I don't know. Probably an ultimatum would work, but you said you don't want to give him one. Maybe couple therapy? Either that or divorce, you seem to be at the end of the rope.

PS: has Eliza been seeing someone all this time? Were they alright with her connection with your husband?

> **OOP:** Before I had my daughter I gave him a ultimatum or either he and Eliza respected my motherhood and she kept her opinions to herself or we were done.
> 
> I dont want to just keep giving ultimatums to keep my marriage.
> 
> Honestly, I don't even know if counseling would work because I don't think he see a problem so he would probably go and has a drink with her and tell about the counseling.

**Commenter 3:** Exactly! Seems like OP wasted her time being the third wheel in her own relationship and ultimately her marriage. Giving ultimatums and then not following through is just a waste of words.
> 
> **Commenter 4:** Yeah he knows she won‚Äôt do anything so he‚Äôs not going to change.
>> 
>> **Commenter 3:** Yup! That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs been 14 years and she‚Äôs pretty much the side chick, just how her husband and Eliza like it. She stomps her feet and they laugh at her or completely ignore her and go back to their little bubble. Then the cycle repeats. OP should‚Äôve left around the time of the abortion. The writing was on the wall in big bold capitalized letters.
>>> 
>>> **OOP:** For the last 14 years everytime every time I express how I don't like our private life to be shared with outsiders he downplay it as needed to talk things about, to vent, his friends are his closes family, they wouldn't never judge. But I'm just right here if he needs to talk to vent o whatever. Then it comes like I want to isolate him.
>>> 
>>> I don't want to isolate him from people he cares I want to share my problems, our problems with him and only him.
>>> 
>>> This past 14 years I've thinking maybe I'm crazy and possessive. Maybe I'm toxic for not understanding how a strong friendship is.
>>> 
>>> Its only because now resentment has build, because I started to see myself as annoying characters between the two main characters.
>>> 
>>> I feel so down. I had given everything into my marriage.

**OOP on why her husband and Eliza divorced in the first place?**

> **OOP:** They married very young at 18 after dating for 3 months.
> 
> Their relationship was very intense in a good way at first then in bad bad way. They divorced 2 years later and discovered they were better off as best friends.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/UQffElmiwF): **November 22, 2024 (one month later)**

I'm gonna start saying how thankfull I'm to everybody that showed grace on my last post.

This isn't a happy update, if anything welcome to the pity, angsty train.

After writing my post and reading how most people felt about, my head was full of doubs and sadness. Your opinion isn't a surprise since most of my friends and family had voiced the same at some point. I guess I'm too slow and need to be punched harder to understand.

Few days after my post, I took a pregnancy test and it was positive. Having a large family is what I (we) always wanted and ever since my abortion I was left with a feeling of having empty arms. So holding my daughter in my arms was like feeling whole again and know I need to grow my arms even more to hold my new baby tooüí´. But after the initial happiness a ugly feeling started to grow in my stomach. I didn't wanted Eliza in our life.

It felt like taking my inocence glasses out and I was able to see her. Like really see her. How every smile was so damn fake, every compliment was always mean spirit or kinda a self compliment ""nice potato salad it was great, oh, remember (to my husband) THAT potato salad I made it was kinda unbelievable blahblahblah"" or ""nice outfil I LOVE how confedent you are, I can't leave the house without making sure my outfit is flawless""

Her reaction to my first pregnancy, wedding, travels, my second pregnancy, buying a house. How everything that should be between my husband and I, always include her, like if our life was a play she should write and direct.

On our first christmas together she came when we were decorating and with all his positive cristics, I ended sitting in a corner drinking wine while she and my husband decorate.

She is always here. And by here I mean in my life. She has a say in everything in my life, to the point that when my husband voice his opinion I can say when these are his words and when are Eliza's.

I'm no saying that since I wrote the last post everybody turned into ultimate evils, but thinking and rethinking about my life with my husband, I had always been a pasive character, its like my husband got himself a pet and he and Eliza are going to be endgame when they both realize they never stopped loving each other.

Some of you, as my sister, will say I'm dormant. I guess I am. I have let this go for so long that it becomes normal. My life isn't bad, my hudband hasn't been a bad husband and Eliza isn't so bad if the bar is she hasn't tried to kill me yet. I know is clear to you all, but to me it have been my life for years, my day to day, I learned to look away and make me small so I don't make others uncomfortable.

Maybe because I'm pregnant and hormonal but I'm tired of this. I love my husband but I feel he can't love fully with Eliza whispering to his ear and him running like a golden retriever to please her.

So after all that thinking and rethinking I sat my husband down and told him we needed to set some strong boundaries because our marriage was working and I didn't feel loved or respected like a wife or even a person. I explained more of less what I said here. My husband denied everything and tried to explain himself saying Eliza was like a sister to him, I say even siblings have boundaries. It was back and forth, with him making me doubt if maybe I was in fact trying to control who was or wasnt in his life. Wanting to monitor his friendships and even joked if will need to sly away to have a drink with his buds. For a moment I feel maybe I was in fact crazy.

But I was firm into my ground: If he wanted to kept this marriage Eliza needs to be gone from our life.

At first I thought low contact was good but seeing his reaction I knew that wasn't going to be enough, maybe _I_ wouldn't bee seeing Eliza, but he certainly will do and I would be antagonized and mocked. Honestly knowing this made me realize my marriage was over.

So I asked important questions and pressed: what his real feeling were? Why they divorced if they where so hung into each other? Why no leave me sooner? Why no _leave me_? Did he loves Eliza more than me? Why? What is that? What is that, that I dont have and she does that makes her imposible to leave?

In a summary: he loves her, but he loves me, he doesn't understand how. Both of us bring something he doesn't want to miss. He is not sure if he wants a life with Eliza like the one we have, a marriage, a family. But she is his soulmate. They divorce because between then it was so much fire the were burning eachother, with me he has calm, peace and loving place to come back. He have never cheated, but admists he sometimes fantasies with her being me and me being her. They often talk about them having this life but agree that being together would break their bond. All fucked up, my god.

I know is was kinda obvious to you all on my first post and it should have been obvious to me, but hearing my husband saying he loves another woman that is his souldmate and he put her in the center of our life, made her an auntie to our daughter and somekind of sister in law to me, a suppose family friend. I'm not gonna lie, it broke me, I threw myseld in the floor and hugged his legs and asked him what I need to do to him to love me, to ONLY love ME. i felt so pathetic, but I believed everything was worth to save something with so much value like my marriage. I cried and cried and cried. And the hardest part was to hear there was nothing I could do.

This. This is all. I know isnt some shocking new, to me my life is falling appart, the only thing holging me up are two little hands that hug me every night and the small bean in my belly.

We haven't discussed anything legal yet. He left the house and my sister and mom and staying with us for now.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** He‚Äôs a selfish cruel man. She is just as equally horrible. He used you and kept her around and she played along with it. He says he sees her as a sister but then says he fantasizes about her being you and you being her, both cannot be true at the same time. She is either a sister to him or he wants her to be his wife. All he does is lie. He was living his best life and got everything he wanted. He HAS cheated, maybe not physically (doubt it), but emotionally he has. You deserve to find someone who truly loves you and chooses you every single time and not someone who has another choice. You were their little doll to play with. You gave him all of these wonderful things so she didn‚Äôt have to, but she gets the perks of being your husband‚Äòs girlfriend without ever having to get pregnant or do any hard labor in a marriage. I‚Äôm so sorry.

**Commenter 2:** While you're going through this transition, do not share details with him that you don't want Eliza to be privy to. Talk with your sister and your mother. Don't tell him about the baby until you're ready for her to also know. Invest the love you had for him back into yourself and your babies. Eliza doesn't want him, she wants the power in your relationship and the control. He's going to come crawling back to the family you built for him. Don't let him.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/OdR1jbitMx): **January 12, 2025 (1.5 months later)**

Hopefully this is going to be my last update but no the end for me.

Thanks again to everybody that send me enouging messages or replied to my last two post.

To clarify a few things people asked guessed yes, I'm south American, I live in very religious country and was raised catholic, even if I don't follow any religion now and consider myself atheist some things just are too deep in our brains. Also yes, I grow up seeing my mom crying over my dad's multiples affairs, I always thought I wouldn't never let something like that happen to me but oops. Luckily I started to see a therapist and will heal a lot of things.

Once of the very first things I started to discuss with my therapist was my abortion a how deeply that hurted me and how big was the impact on my mind. And yes, some of you guessed well. After the abortion I was determined to get something good out of a very traumatic event. Since I loved my then my then boyfriend so much maybe our relationship could get stronger and better. And I fought hard for that. Then after a time it was more of ""have I suffered so much for this relationship just to lose it over this one thing? No"" and later it was just ""this is my life, go to sleep and get over the pain"" now I realize how alike that was to my mom mindset was while forgiving my dad. But since I was getting physically cheated I never crossed my mind I was doing the same thing.

Now on my husband and I. We are getting divorce. I put on my big girl pants and went to talk to him again. I promised myself and my children I would never beg to someone to love, and my children wouldn't have to grow believing that something is worth more than loving and respecting yourself.

Ok, so so I went to talked to him, mostly to I went yo say I wanted a divorce that's all, at first I wanted to write all the things he did that hurt me and how much they hurt but what's the point? Communication time is over for us as a couple.

He wa all shocked and then teary because he didn't want to divorce, he tried to convince me to take more time to think. Then he tried to negotiate, what I needed for this to work. What I wanted and what he was willing to do, he was so generous to offer to take some distance from Eliza to work our stuff. I laughed like a maniac becauseü§Ø

He said our family means everything to him. Our daughter. Our new baby. I was something he valued so much I was the heart of his family and he will always loves me and be thankfull for all I gave to him. This hurt because yeah. He doesn't see me like a woman or his wife. I'm the mother of his children I'm the one who takes care of him and his house and his thankfull?

It was a long talk. But it was mostly the same thing again and again.

In the end he proposed me to keep the house, stay married because his job has a lot of great benefits and I should use them all even if we weren't together. He would cover all expenses and we could live in different houses.

In the he reluctantly agree to divorce.

I'm working now on establishing new boundaries. I agree we should keep it friendly becuase we have 2 kids to coparent and since he doesn't have a place to live yet he could hang with our daughter in our home, take him to park etc. But then he was showing unannounced in my (our?) house, cook for himself and act live he still lived there, I was getting really uncomfortable I had asked for his keys prior but he said he wanted to kept the keys for emergency's only. One day I snapped to either give me the keys back or I will change the locks, again he was all teary because he was this was still his home, I said it wasn't anymore so no more hanging out here.

Now I'm thinking it's best to sell this house and find something new that can be mine and the kids home only.

As for Eliza, some of you will be happy to know they aren't together he isn't staying with her and for all I know she has distanced herself from him. Maybe she only liked him when he was in a relationship? Or now her power trip is over she isn't interested? He is pretty heartbroken his absolutely best friend isn't with him now. Like really heartbroken. I know this because a mutual friend told me and we he comes to pick our daughter he seems in a bad shape. He is unkeep and has lost some weight and always looks so tired.

My pregnancy is doing fine, as you might have guessed I'm not interrupting it, so between a divorce and having a baby this year I guess I will have very eventfull year.

Thats all I guess.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Sending hugs, good on you. I wanted to say that in your post you said that you are pursuing divorce because you want to teach your children about loving and respecting themselves, and I think that is so honourable.

> **OOP:** Yeah thanks! I also want to teach myself about loving and respecting myself ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Commenter 2:** He‚Äôs an idiot!!

Put his ex above you & his children just to get burned by her! She never wanted him, she just loved the control she had on him!

> **OOP:** It's a shame I won't be able to know exactly what happened between them and their fallaout.
> 
> I'm distancing myself from that drama but I would love to know (like the big gossiper I am)

**Commenter 3:** I am so happy for you.

The idea of a different house is good. You can also just change all the locks.

Build a social support group for yourself. Build distance with your ex. Limit interactions.

Wish you all the best.

> **OOP:** I think the new house will be the best without any sad memory just a fresh start. Also I want to live closer to my mom and sister since I will be needing their help :)

**Commenter 4:** So your stupid ex lost you to keep his side piece, and now side piece left him. What a dumbass.

Okay, you are really going to have to go with me here...i still can't quite get my head around it. I was at this guys apartment after we had seen a movie and he went out to the store to get us some condoms, as he realised he didnt have any. I know its bad to snoop but i felt like i wanted to get to know him better...we have only been seeing eachother 3 and a half weeks. Long story short i opened the bed side table drawer next to his bed, which had a clear jar in it with four used tampons in it. Obviously at this point i froze, trying to find a logical explanation as to why they could be there.

He gets back and i confront him about it. He really went off at me about snooping...but eventually said that they were his ex's tampons, and that hes got a thing for periods. The worst part is she doesnt even know, he used to fish them out the bin to keep so that he could look at them later. Obviously im not seeing him again, but do i tell his ex what i found? I know who she is and i feel like i have some sort of responsibility to tell her

[HELP: I slept with a guy nearly 48hrs ago and he won't leave my place!!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/aRHcRFqMhs)  **Feb 10, 2019**

I am recently out of a long-term relationship, and its been a long time since I have 'dated', so I have been meeting guys from Tinder for hook-ups and dates. I went on a date with this guy on Friday night, and it was okay, he seemed nice and we ended up going back to mine and hooking up. Anyway...fast forward to, well, NOW, and the dude is STILL HERE. I'm used to a guy staying for a while the next day, having coffee or whatever, but he slept over Saturday night too, and now I'm worried he is going to end up staying tonight too. He's been here way too long now and I have no idea how to get rid of him. He used my toilet, and I had forgotten to put more paper in there...he called me to the toilet to give him some paper because he shit in my toilet. HE SHIT IN MY TOILET. That's how long he's been here...he's had a shit. Idk I just think one nighters have overstayed their welcomes when they shit at your place. 

I have politely said on Saturday 'I have a lot to be getting on with today', and 'I have some errands to run', but he didn't get himself ready to go or anything, and I really don't wanna leave him in my place unattended. I even got dressed, put my coat on and told him I was going out and he just asked if I could grab him a coffee on my way back (!!!!!!). I did say today that he should probably leave soon as I need to get myself sorted for work Monday, and he just said 'yeah no problem'...but that was 3 hours ago and he is still chilling in my bed watching TV.

I'm really worried now because I need to go to work tomorrow and I'm scared that he won't EVER leave. I told him that I need to work Monday and he just changes the subject and asks about my work. How do I get him to leave? I've been in situations before where guys have turned in a bad way when I have refused advances, not given them my number etc, only this is worse because he is in my apartment and I am worried that he might turn nasty when we are alone. 

Probs worth noting that I suspected nothing at dinner on Friday night, he didn't seem like a weirdo or anything. Guess I didn't realise I'd be gaining a live-in boyfriend after one date and some drunk mediocre sex. What is the best way to deal with all of this?

(Sorry about the bad grammar etc wanted to get an update out for people who asked)

I decided to message a couple of friends who came over right away. The guy introduced himself really casually and started talking about his life and asking about theirs. I could tell they were uncomfortable and the more assertive of the two said that we were going out, does he want to share our cab. He said that he had some calls to make (?) And that he would catch us up. My friend said no really this is not your place and you need to go. Honestly the dude stared blankly at me and was like 'did you get them over here to say that? Why are you embarrassing me like this?' He called me a bitch and said i had made him look like a weirdo. He got his shit together swearing and walked out the door. I'm so happy he is gone and greatful to everyone that commented with advice - bit concerned that he knows my address but my friends are staying tonight to be sure. If he comes back and swears like that again then i think ill call the police

[Just moved in with boyfriend - I think I have been duped into joining a cult](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/Te9XO5wS0g)  **May 7, 2019**

TL;DR: I moved into my boyfriends communal living complex and I think I have accidentally joined a cult. How do I move out without jeopardising the relationship?

&#x200B;

I have been dating this guy for about 4 weeks. I know its a bit too soon to be moving in, but we have really fallen head over heels for one another, and he seemed so keen on us moving in together to see where things go. I need some advice on how to move out so I can get to know his living situation better before we move forward with our relationship

&#x200B;

I did think his living situation was a little odd. He told me he lives in one of these new communal living spaces where residents do things together like cooking, cleaning, etc. Seemed okay to me I was open to trying something new. For the first few days people seemed nice...but now I have started to come out of our room a bit more I am worried that I have accidentally joined a cult. There is a main hall that the residents gather in (around 45 people, ish?) and discuss events of the day. There is one guy that always leads this session, and people seem to fucking love him. Like worship him. To make matters more suspect I am convinced that he is sleeping with at least four of the women there - and two of them have kids with him. I am all open for people to live how they want, but I don't want my boyfriend to think I am down with him doing the same. The guy that leads the daily sessions has been trying to set up a meeting with me to 'get to know his newest resident better', and I'm genuinely worried that he is trying to wife me too. He's pretty old, stinks and has that weird white mouth cheese stuff that some old people get around their lips, so I have no idea why these women love him.

&#x200B;

Before I moved in, I paid a deposit (standard) and filled out a questionnaire about myself. It asked all kinds of things like where I work, my boss' email and my family's details. I kind of wish I hadn't done this, because I spoke to my boyfriend yesterday and said that I might go and stay with a friend for a while because this is all a bit much for me all at once. Later on this afternoon a couple of women came over to me in the dining hall, mentioning my family by name...they said they nearly called them to check my whereabouts yesterday because I had been out so long...I was at work! i don't know what business they have with my family but this shit is creeping me out. I feel like this was some kind of threat, and that my boyfriend might have told them about me wanting to leave. Maybe I am just being paranoid.

&#x200B;

I also think they are filming everything. One of the women asked me if I had ever been in any accidents, and mentioned that 'she also had a large scar'. The only large scar that I have is on my stomach...unless my boyfriend told them how would they know? I have only got my stomach out in the shower and in our bedroom. I hope they haven't been filming because we have had sex in both of these places. 

&#x200B;

So overall, i need some advice on how to keep my boyfriend but also move out. i don't know if I am overreacting, but i have a bad vibe about this place. They have already put me on the 'work rota' three days a week, going out and handing out flyers about various charities, as well as supervising the communal childcare room that they have in the complex. I have a full-time job and I can't fulfil these duties, and this is already causing friction.

What I was planning to write about ‚Äì a local event called Theater Fest, in progress at the time ‚Äì was the reason why I couldn‚Äôt find a place in my neighborhood ‚Äì the high-school theater kids arrive in high-school buses from all over the state, and as this is a free-roaming sort of event, they descend on the campus coffee places in massive lines that circle the interior, everyone chatting in a friendly way with their besties as they proceed to decimate the pastry sections. The vibe is so uniformly pleasant, I forgot it was a Saturday, a big deal for a bunch of the people to be spending time like this, the significant percentage of kids who had to take off work to attend Theater Fest. Among kids in any high school, the subset into theater would be among the more mature, and so I don‚Äôt really see any teachers or chaperones or even the bus drivers who have to make themselves scarce for most of a day ‚Äì I picture the drivers together smoking cigarettes and playing cards in some rumpus room somewhere. The coffee place down the block is across from the world-class performing arts center, which is where the kids were getting off buses, so it was the coffee place to take the brunt of Theater Fest, the place filling up early and staying that way all day. A bunch of these kids will be performing, and some will do on-the-spot auditions for some of the two-dozen college theater programs in attendance. I don‚Äôt know what their dreams might be, but all these theater kids from around the state could be the ones who brought about a rebirth of the theater, a theater of a whole new kind, and that seems like a much more profound sort of fame than actual stardom. They could be the same, I guess, and that thought stays with me as I cut across the commons area to find a coffee place spared by Theater Fest. In the first third of my walk over, I pass a group of exuberant high schoolers who start singing the national anthem for some reason ‚Äì once a couple of voices set the rhythm, the rest join in, such that a crowd of Theater Fest attendees is suddenly laughing and singing the national anthem while ambling up the street. During the second third of the walk, I come across a group of eight or ten old white guys who are bunched together and smiling outrageously for a selfie photo. I don‚Äôt know why It seems so memorable to me, the chummy boomers with the selfie stick, except that when I see old dudes smiling as one like that, I assume they‚Äôre doing something illegal, won‚Äôt be caught for it. Like maybe they forced the theater kids to start singing the national anthem earlier, and before then, blocked a UN peace resolution, and before then, told the voting public to not get its hopes up, and before then, personally pushed a glacier down a mountain, into the sea. I carry this feeling the rest of the way to the coffee place, which is designed in the neo-industrial style of exposed ductwork and crisscrossing cables. Indeed, the kids didn‚Äôt get this far, but as I sat there trying to write about Theater Fest, a few older people, who I took to be parents and grandparents, came and went in small groups, here to see some of the performances. Optimism can be a contact drug, and I could feel it radiating off them, like maybe the kids are second- or third-generation theater lovers. The Barista behind the counter has a movie star‚Äôs sense of glamour, could be both 19 and 38 years old, and I see how eyes follow her around the caf√© as she sweeps, as she wipes off the brushed metal. I wonder how that must feel ‚Äì all those searchlights following her around the interior, noses practically sniffing the air for hints of willingness. A willingness to what? Make it to the top? I go back to writing about theater kids, imagine the observation about the Barista is my own delusion. Those bus drivers biding their time ‚Äì perhaps they‚Äôve all been doing this annual trip for decades, have strong opinions about the theatrical arts. I remember taking Gary Sinise to Theater Fest, one would say. Yes, but I brought Malkovich! would shout another. Someone walks across the room talking to John Cusack on the phone, calling him Johnny ‚Äì remember those years I drove you to Theater Fest, Johnny? No one‚Äôs sure any of it‚Äôs true, but it might be. The vision behind the counter says they‚Äôre closing, so I fold up my notebook, put my things in my backpack. The Barista asks me if I could stay for a second and help her with something in back, then turns the deadbolt door lock and motions me to follow. Could you? she wonders, gesturing to a tray on a high rack. I get the tray down, set it on the counter, pastries glistening with icing. I can tell she‚Äôs about to ask me how she could ever repay my timely help, my feat of strength, and I say, How about a pastry?

However, I have noticed that their prices are very random and they will randomly change the drink recipe without telling you. I have got a $9 drink from them because when I want to add espresso to the drink, they enter the espresso as a separate drink (it can be how they charge for adding espresso to a drink but this is not common to see people charging shots that as a full separate drink). Once ordered a drink with cold foam, and they just didn‚Äôt bother to explain that they are out of the cold foam, then skipped it. Then they tried to charge extra for cold foam for a drink that comes with cold foam.
Recently went to Coffee Time too and their special seasonal drink was like $8 as well.

I am curious what would be your recommendation for coffee shops that have good coffee and preferably with a clear menu with price listed so I won‚Äôt end up in an awkward situation when the barista tell me that cup of coffee costs $8 to $9.

(Hopefully this is not too much to ask for.)

Edit: don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt dislike Chaotic Good but it is so frustrating to get something overly expensive or something you paid for but wasn‚Äôt made right.

Q1) How do I ensure I am making Accenture more money than it is costing Accenture to keep me employed when project durations are 6 weeks to  months? 

Q2) How do you define being on the bench too long? Is it different for Juniors vs Seniors?

Q3) What is an acceptable amount of time of being on the bench?

Q4) What's the difference between AFS and LLP?

Q5) How do I know when to make charge to client vs BD? 

Q7) From this sub, I got to know we have to reduce our bench time. So, when should I start looking for my next project during my current project?

Q8) Can you please share networking tips for apprentices? What should I do and offer to seniors in order to make it worth their time to have coffee chat with me? I don't want to just be a taker. I want to be able to give as well. But I am not sure what I can give them being a junior.  - (Someone here mentioned that coffee chats are key to getting placed in projects.)

Q9) Somebody mentioned on this sub that we have to constantly interview for projects. I am just confused because I already interviewed with Accenture... So, what are these interviews for? What do these interviews entail? Does it involve technical assessments like coding assessments only or other things as well?

Last year, nakapag desisyon na ako na istop na yung paghihintay ko pero bigla siyang nag ask if pwede  na ba kaming magjowa. I said yes. Within those 7 years, may ka chat siyang iba or ka fling2 pero wala akong magagawa kasi no label nga kami. Hindi ko kayang magawa sa kanya yung mag fling2 sa iba kasi alam kong masasaktan siya. 
Sinabihan niya ako na magbabago na siya kasi in a relationship na kami. May hope din naman ako. 

Ngayon ang problema ay yung parents niya. Im 25yrs old btw. Before, nung students pa kami. Ang babaw ng tingin ng parents niya sa akin kasi wala pa akong mapakita. While nagstudy sa college, nag start na din ako mag work as a bpo agent. Right now sa awa ng Diyos, may mga investment na at negosyo while keeping my work. Wala po akong bisyo. Im just really prepping myself para sa future namin. Always ko sasabihin sa kanya na soon bibili ako ng bahay namin na kami lang dalawa. Pero sobrang hesitant niya at biglang mag open up siya ng bagong topic sa convo namin. Sinabihan din ako ng mga closed friends niya,  nagsasabi daw yung nanay niya sa kanila na hindi nila gusto na parati kaming magkasama. Last night, bumili kami ng coffee. Dalawang coffee. Para sa akin at para sa kanya. Nung pumunta kami sa bahay nila. Hindi namin nabilhan yung helper nila ng coffee kasi na short kami sa cash. Sinabihan ako na ng nanay niya na ""pangit talaga ng ugali mo bat di mo binilhan kasali yung helper"". Hindi na talaga umimik bilang respeto nadin sa jowa ko. Sinabihan ako ng jowa ko na pabulong na ""joke lang yung sinabi ng nanay ko"". Its not funny at all. Hindi niya din gusto humiwalay sa parents niya. Nagrereklamo na din siya sa akin before na, kinokontrol ng parents niya yung life niya. 

Iwan ko talaga. Ayaw ko magbukod ng bahay na kasama parents niya at hindi ko na talaga matiis parents niya. Gusto ko lang talaga peace of mind. I think it would be better na makipaghiwalay na kami kasi ako yung nahihirapan sa situation namin. Ipinatatanggol pa niya yung parents niya which I understand kasi parents niya. Yung hindi ko talaga maintindihan kung bakit ako yung pinag aadjust niya sa lahat ng situation at sasabihan pa ako na to understand her parents kasi daw hindi ko alam yung pinagdadaanan nila.

I am currently living out of my truck. I was sitting in a multistore parking lot changing clothes for work. I have a sunshade on the front windshield an black cardboard for the other windows. I had just come from the senior center for coffee and parked when there was a knock on my window. I opened the door without a shirt to 2 Orange County sheriffs deputies who said hello and asked what I am doing and that they‚Äôve seen my truck here before and they have a right to find out what I‚Äôm doing because it is private property. I shook one of the deputies hands and explained that I am homeless since July 17 when I was unlawfully evicted and I have not had enough money to find a place to live. At this time I noticed light smoke exiting the cab that was from the air conditioned air meeting the atmosphere and having excess moisture that turns to looking like smoke. I know the deputy noticed this also as he asked me to step out of my vehicle which I did. He said I‚Äôm not under arrest I‚Äôm just being detained.  He searched me, handcuffed me and placed me in the back of their cruiser. He asked if he can search my vehicle and I said I‚Äôve had too many things done to me so I do not feel comfortable having you search my vehicle

Both deputies went back to my vehicle and one of them leaned in and then they started tossing my truck and going through my toiletry bag and backpack. They came back and said they found a baggy with white residue and they know what stuff is do I want to tell them what it is and I said the only baggy I‚Äôm aware of contains ibuprofen for my pinched nerve and the pills were cut in half. 

They went back to tossing my truck then the deputy mirandized me then took off my handcuffs and I was released with a citation for possession of meth and paraphernalia. I was never shown what they found, nor was anything tested in my presence

My question is did they have probable cause? And shouldn‚Äôt my vehicle be more protected since it is my home. Do I have a good chance to beat these charges?

She would cut me off if she even knew I had Reddit. (No social media is a STRICT rule.) anyways, my sister and I are both in college- which is being primarily paid for by my father‚Äôs military benefits. (He is a disabled veteran.) however, whatever is left over my parents pay for. I am incredibly thankful and express this often. I primarily live on campus in a dorm with my sister- college is almost an hour away from home so it would be too hard to drive back and forth when going full time. 

Anyways- my parents bought our car when my sister was 16 and said we would share it. Again, I was incredibly grateful. However, it‚Äôs been almost 4 years and she still treats the car like it‚Äôs not ours. I understand that she paid for it- but I can‚Äôt go anywhere without her needing to know where I‚Äôm going. Whenever we leave our dorm, (she knows because she forced us to download life 360), she texts us the entire time we‚Äôre out asking when we‚Äôre gonna go home and do school work. Nags us about spending our own money. Tells us not to get any sugary drinks or food. Etc‚Ä¶ anything she can complain about she will complain about the WHOLE TIME. Furthermore, whenever we forget to tell her where we‚Äôre going she will have a fit and tell us how the car is actually hers and how she can take it away. Am I the only one that feels this is childish? We have never gone anywhere inappropriate. We literally go to book stores, Walmart, or coffee shops?? Occasionally to the mall where we never buy anything or else we will be scolded‚Ä¶ moreover- she calls us constantly and nags about how we don‚Äôt talk to her enough or how we need to clean our room or blah blah blah. We are nothing but respectful to her and our dad‚Ä¶ all I ask is for a little respect back? Am I wrong? Like today‚Ä¶ she got mad bc I didn‚Äôt respond right away to her telling me to clean up my own dishes‚Ä¶ which I‚Äôve never not done. 

Edit: I see a lot of people mentioning getting a job and paying for myself- which I actually tried to do twice now. I had a job before college which they encouraged me to quit so I could focus on my studies. Then, a semester or two ago I said I wanted to get a job on campus and they got upset saying that it would take away from school and that they‚Äôre already paying for everything so I don‚Äôt need the job. Then- this summer, I said I wanted a summer job and even applied but they told me AGAIN that I‚Äôd have to quit when summer was over and that it was useless. They said if I was bored and wanted something to do then they would just sign me up for summer classes. I know what you‚Äôre thinking‚Ä¶ why not just get the job anyway?

33F and 6 weeks postpartum with my 2nd kiddo. Had hypertension at the delivery of our girl, which got better and preeclampsia was ruled out. My body went through a lot following delivery (spark notes: had retained products of conception, took meds to pass huge clots and material, but two trips to the ER, lots of having to advocate for my body, lots of stress, etc). In one of my follow ups, my BP was 158/84. I went through monitoring and was prescribed 100mg Labetalol 2x a day. 

After Labetalol, took a couple measurements at home and they were 130-140s/80-90s, but had one or two upper 150/100s. 

At my 6 week follow up earlier this week my BP was 158/112. Which‚Ä¶ugh. So I was sent to my PCP. She prescribed me nifedipine 30mg ER. I‚Äôm on day two and I don‚Äôt see a ton of change yet. I have so many questions about this journey. I also have no idea why this is happening to my body‚Ä¶.why now‚Ä¶

1. What‚Äôs the journey to get the right meds? Does it take a while? 
2. How long does it take a new medication to take effect? Should I already be seeing improvements with nifedipine‚Ä¶even when I am not?
3. What lifestyle changes do I need to make? Will I be on meds forever? 
4. What would you go back and tell yourself at the start of your hypertension diagnosis? 
5. And a silly one‚Ä¶.do you abstain from coffee and alcohol? My doctor told me to stay away from alcohol and I‚Äôm so bummed - being freshly no longer pregnant I was really looking forward to a glass of wine every once in a while.

I (f30) work as a hairdresser in a small-ish salon of 6 staff. We have 3 seniors including the boss, 2 juniors and 1 second year apprentice.

I've dealt with massive burnout before from lack of boundaries with work ( different salon) coming home with me and I've only just recovered last year from it and feel back to normal. 

The issue- Myself and other staff had issues with the apprentice (f22) in and outside of work. It's been happening for a year and I've done everything I can possibly think of to manage the situation.
My opinion of her after working together is she very sensitive in a doesn't take constructive criticism well unless you dress it up she's amazing, is lazy, arrogant, paranoid, and lacks a lot of self awareness. It's almost like she's needs to babied all the time which doesn't work in this industry, you have to have thick skin, people can be very nasty.

My last run in with her was telling her to get off the computer/till and to help clean, she refused and after back and forth I gave up. I was just done and told my boss the situation and that I would only talk to her if I had to as in work related, I would say hello if she said hello, if she asked for help and I had time I will, but no more personal matters or training her. My boss did announce no more juniors doing the till I guess to smooth it over( note- we've had small amounts of cash go missing all year and when we made it only seniors do the till and it started to balance straight away after so I'm not buying my outburst was why and it's a bit suspicious atm) I do my job as a senior. I just don't engage with her on personal matters or go completely out of my way to keep my peace. I was done trying to form a relationship with someone who makes everything a competition and is frankly just stressing me out to where I'm hoping she's pulling a sick day.

The part I may be the AH- I‚Äôm pulled into the office by the boss during work and was told I had to start talking to her and be 'nicer to her ' because I'm hurting her feelings. How? I was getting her client a coffee, after caping her up and hadn't told her that client was there yet. I was getting it all ready when she barged in the break room and said I hadn't told her she was there and I showed I was making a coffee and just said ' okay?'. I was caught off guard and I know my response wasn't the best. While my boss did defend me saying I was probably getting her ready and then tell her so she could start asap when she accused me, but my boss tell me my behaviour was why she's so ‚Äòstubborn‚Äô and ‚Äòafraid to help‚Äô. I admit, I lost my temper and called her insufferable.
