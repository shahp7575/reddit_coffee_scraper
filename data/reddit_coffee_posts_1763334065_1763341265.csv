1oz2n0d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oz2n0d,Overwhelmed with style/color options for living room,"I'm struggling to pull together a cohesive living room design. My main priority is creating a cozy space that facilitates movie night for 5-6 friends and is appropriate with the kitchen design since the two spaces are connected.
• Sectional: Approximately 9/10 feet long positioned across from the TV, with a chaise/ottoman running along the window wall. The space along the wall opposite the TV is 12 feet so this will give some space for plants/lighting/side tables beside the sectional.
• Color: The walls and kitchen are white (kitchen has brass fixtures), so I want the sectional to be a bold color. My favorite color is green, so I was leaning towards emerald/dark green. I am also fine with a dark moss color that is less vibrant. The floors are a light brown, I would say neutral/slightly warm.
• I've never designed a space or bought large furniture and feel overwhelmed by the price, options, and concern about limiting future design/having to design around a single item

Current Items I Own (Most are in the pictures)

• TV - 65 in- keeping
• Speakers - dark brown - keeping
• speaker stands - reddish brown - optional
• tall lamps x 2 - optional
• small lamps x 2 (not the reading/desk lamp)- prefer to keep, they are different styles than each other so I can put one in the other room if it doesn’t fit the aesthetic 

Need To Buy
I suspect the sectional choice will inform the rest of the space's color palette and style. I need advice on:
1. Sectional (Color/Style Recommendation)
2. TV Stand
3. Coffee Table (or an ottoman with similar functionality)
4. Rug
5. Curtains & Rod
6. Pillows & Throws
7. Wall Art
8. Other Lighting
9. Plants & Pots
10. Optional Small Chair: I'm considering one for extra seating, ideally with its back facing the kitchen opening.

Summary of questions
1. Is an Emerald Green Sectional too risky/limiting for a first big furniture purchase, should I go with a neutral color? (Other color suggestions welcome, including bold or neutral colors!)
2. Any recommendations for a comfortable, quality, 9-foot sectional with quick shipping in the $3k-$5k range?
3. What style of TV stand, coffee table, and rug would best complement a bold colored sectional and the existing white/brass kitchen? (e.g., Wood tone? Metal accents? Rug pattern?) or anything else listed in “Need to buy”",1,1763341157.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

My mom pairs us up, we send her our wishlists, and she forwards them to whoever got our name. Easy, right?

Except apparently not.

I’m not even claiming to be an amazing gift giver, but if someone says “I want this specific thing,” I will literally just… buy it. Because that’s the whole point of a wishlist?
The last two years I’ve given a super simple, very cheap list, everything under $25. And both years I’ve gotten nothing from it.
 
Instead it’s like my Santa just panic-stops at Dollar Tree and grabs whatever five random items are in arm’s reach. Zero thought. Zero effort.

Meanwhile I show up with actual gifts that match what people asked for. Last year I gave my person a cute mug, her favorite coffee, and a $50 Barnes & Noble gift card with a note saying we could go together. 
Maybe I went overboard, whatever. But then I open my gift and it’s:– a tacky gnome thing– a cheap dirty oven mitt– another random wooden “Live Laugh Love reject” decor piece

All stuff straight from the dollar store. And again, none of it was even close to anything on my list. They maybe spent $5 max.

So this year my husband (his first year in this chaos) and I decided we’re not doing it. We’re tapping out. We’re tired of feeling disappointed and pretending it’s fine.

This made me think about the p-zombie thought experiment, and how a true p-zombie could never 'remember' how its like to have qualia nor feel that it was missing qualia - for that is qualia itself.

Has anyone else felt this way, in this partial p-almost-zombie where you somewhat remember and miss how it feels but no long feel them with same phenomenal consciousness?

Curious if anyone else has experienced this sort of experiential “muting” and how they made sense of it philosophically or personally.

He dug a biscuit from his pack and took another swig of his canteen, pausing briefly to refill it.  He had the makings of a coffee in there but he held off on digging it out or building a fire.  It just seemed selfish to dally with a luxury like that when there was a woman out there frightened and deprived of such herself. 

He saddled the big red horse and secured their gear.  They headed out back in the direction of the carriage side by side.  The big man let the walk work the stiffness out of his muscles, it wasn’t all that far back to the carriage.  Besides he’d have to dismount again to cut a track anyhow.

The carriage had burned through the night, just a charred hulk remained.  The woodsman eased close and let his eyes soak in the details of the scene.  He circled out slowly keeping a close eye on the ground.  He soon spotted what he was looking for.  Not much more than a scuff in the needles of the forest floor where someone moving fast had stumbled on a root.  It was almost straight away from the open carriage door confirming she had bolted into the woods.

Direction confirmed, he moved out on foot letting the big stud just follow behind.

The woman had covered a lot of ground in the night.  Her fear driving her recklessly deeper in rougher terrain.  The woodsman was assured he was on the right track, snapped branches, scuffed ground and once even strip of snagged silk marked his trail.

He paused at the snagged silk it wasn’t much larger than one of the coins he carried but the softness and sky blue color was intriguing.

Eochu pushed on through the day.  The sign was getting more sporadic.  The adrenaline of her initial flight must have worn off in the night through here causing her to move with less haste.

It was on a canyon’s rim where the under growth got gnarly that he spotted several strands of brunette hair tangled & dangling from a limb about chest high to him.  

He hung a left at the rim and proceeded up it following his instinct as much as the intermittent track. 

The sight of brunette hair snagged on the limb struck a chord with him.  It was foolish he knew to dwell on the unknown.  But as he hiked along he thought of women in general.  He hadn’t made time for them through the years he’d been off to war.  

His last love had been the black smith’s daughter in the village nearest his game keeper’s cottage.  
He had been a younger man then, in the prime of his life.  She had been a fiery strawberry blonde nearly 20, slim, freckled and exciting in many ways.

The blacksmith and Eochu had gotten along well their friendship had that quiet depth of two no nonsense men.  Looking back the blacksmith may have even nudged the two of them together some hoping Eochu’s solid calm would offset the wild & rebellious fire cracker of his daughter.

She’d accepted Eochu’s attentions with shocking ease.  She’d never turned down a gift or a compliment.  Though her moods swung like the tail of a cow on a hot day and were punctuated by her sharp tongue.
 Eochu was soon to learn his romantic investment amounted to little though.  When she got bored of his attentions she ran off with a traveling merchant.  

Something had clicked in Eochu back then & settled right down to his core.  He knew he’d never fall for a woman like her again.

It was a mix of familiar and whatever took our fancy. Where we ended up:

1. Neo Coffee Bar - not new, but a location I’d yet to visit. Figured it was a good place to start. Had the houjicha latte and some mochi. 

2. Xihe Peking Duck - the $19.99 quarter duck leg seemed worth a shot. There is crunch but don’t expect beautiful skin. Good value here. YMMV. 

3. Sang Ji Bao - also not new, but new menu items. Enjoyed the fish noodle soup. Good clean broth. Would consider this again. I still prefer the OG dry scallion noodle to the spicy pork version.

4. The Peachy - had a decent enough croissant (though no crunchy/flaky to speak of, due to the rainy weather I assume). I was told they make it in-house when I quizzed them about where they get their dough. I had this place on my map for the bingsu, but it was too cold so I will save it for another day. 

5. Caphelia - spied during our roaming and decided to go in. An excellent Vietnamese egg coffee here. Very coffee forward. Not too sweet. Will be back for this again. My favourite taste of the day. 

6. Yee’s Hand Pulled Noodle - got the pork and pickled veg. Nice noodles. Needed the chili oil. Would try in a brothy braised beef next time. 

7. Woojoo Bunsik - random pick as we walked by. Self-coined korean street food, but we picked three tofu pockets (inari): Eel, scrambled egg, and kimchi. 

8. Tacqueria El Pastorcito - on my map and enhanced by Reddit here. Had four tacos (pastor, chorizo, lengua, and tripa) and would order the tripe again. Best texture favour. Bonus points for the sauce/topping selection. Good soft tortillas (though I am no expert). Thanks, team!

9. Miss Fu in Chengdu - Had takeout in the summer that made us want to further explore their menu, so there we were. Smashed cukes, the snakehead fish soup, and ox gastric wall were all very nice. Special high-five to the guy who served us both times and took the time to point out dish dupes and made real suggestions to the table. The service alone makes me want to return.

I’m currently on the depo provera birth control shot, and when I had spoken to the doctor before being prescribed she asked me a list of questions to see what I was eligible to take, one of which was heart palpitations/problems. I had no prior history of any of those issues so I told her no, and started taking it. I have been on depo provera before and I’ve been on it for about 6 months now, and I noticed tonight while laying in bed my heart beat funny a few times, felt like an extra beat after beating once, and did that a couple times for a good few minutes straight.

I am not the pickiest when it comes to Coffee. My partner cares a little more than me, but not much.

For context, we've had a Delonghi Stilosa for a few years now and a cheap $15 grinder and for the most part that's done the job admirably for our standards.

Now the Stilosa has shuffled off this mortal coil and we're keen to get something a bit better. The issue is, there are a LOT of opinions on what's actually good.

I don't want some TikTok aesthetic Coffee process that takes 20 minutes for an espresso. I want it to be efficient enough to get a decent coffee and thats it.

So as you all know a shite load more than I, what on Earth should we get? Budgets around A$750 \*\*\*at the absolute most\*\*\*.

So far I've been tempted by:

- a refurbished Breville Barista Pro for $750

- brand new Barista Express for $590

- The Ninja machine that does a few different things for $650

But is it better to have a separate grinder and machine? If so what's the priority for price; machine or grinder? If I'm going that modular is the quality of the portafilter really that important?

Anyway, you're all the geniuses so please help me before I have to live without coffee for too long.",1,1763340235.0,espresso,2,0.67,False
1oz2arq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1oz2arq/workplace_sexual_harassment_aftermath_and_next/,Workplace Sexual Harassment Aftermath and Next Steps,"I usually listen to every podcast the day they’re released but was just catching up on this week’s episode today. I heard the first story about the workplace sexual harassment and thought I’d seek some advice regarding my own workplace sexual harassment.

Starting a year ago at one of my team-building events through my company, a coworker John (M55) began making comments to me (F24) about the size of my breasts. The first time was at this company outing, but my coworkers were tipsy and didn’t hear. He mentioned I was “top heavy” and motioned to his own chest then looking at mine. I played it off that he was just tipsy, and didn’t see the point in reporting it at the time since we worked on different shifts and rarely saw each other. At this point I had only been with the company for a few years while he had been working there the better part of 2 decades. I had looked to him as a mentor figure that looked out for me and gave me advice relating to work and moving up in the company.

Well I didn’t see him for a while after this, until late spring this year when a coworker went on vacation and he began coming in during my shift to help cover. The sexual comments continued during this time and I ended up consulting with an employment attorney and reporting it to my boss the following day. I only consulted with an attorney because I wanted to make sure I was making a protected complaint and that all my ducks were in a row.

When I discussed it with my boss I was so embarrassed and was crying to him while I went through the list of all the harassing comments. I was compliant with the HR investigation and was met with animosity from my coworkers. I was told I wasn’t allowed to speak about the investigation and neither was John. John ended up telling all our coworkers and I knew from how cold they were towards me. Our team used to grab coffee in the afternoons and they started finding ways around it so they could go without me. 

I really tried ignoring it for a while but in the last month it’s gotten insufferable. Dave, one of John’s friends who was barely cordial with me before I reported the harassment, has been snippy and short with me when I’ve had to ask him questions. We work in a lab so our conversations usually go, “Hey are you using the scale still?” Things like that. Dave works on my shift, but John doesn’t. Dave and John will usually call at the beginning of the week for a verbal acknowledgement of the things that need to be done. These things are supposed to be sent via email, but they discuss things I’m not privy to and Dave will pick on me for it and be snappy. I have no problem being assertive and have been blunt with Dave beforehand that these things need to be sent by email and not withheld from me and private conversations.

Meanwhile, John is back to trying to be “buddy buddy” with me. I think he might’ve been on a probationary period/PIP that ran its course. John and I still work different shifts but he’s usually here one day a week to help out while I’m here. While John gets to act like everything is normal and goes back to work like it’s just another day hanging out with his friends like Dave, I’m stuck with this looming animosity from others on the team that makes it more difficult to do my job.

I’m up for promotion next year and worried about saying anything to my boss, but I have a 1-on-1 this week and wanted to bring it up. Has anyone dealt with this before?

TLDR: After reporting sexual harassment this summer I my coworkers have treated me differently and it has now escalated to impacting how I can do my job. How do I bring this up to my supervisor in our 1-on-1 this week?",3,1763340234.0,TwoHotTakes,3,1.0,False

No prior health concerns

I’m currently on the depo provera birth control shot, and when I had spoken to the doctor before being prescribed she asked me a list of questions to see what I was eligible to take, one of which was heart palpitations/problems. I had no prior history of any of those issues so I told her no, and started taking it. I have been on depo provera before and I’ve been on it for about 6 months now, and I noticed tonight while laying in bed my heart beat funny a few times, felt like an extra beat after beating once, and did that a couple times for a good few minutes straight.

I almost never have caffeine, as I don’t really enjoy pop or coffee, but I had about a quarter of a can of monster like 11 hours ago, but that feels like a decent amount of time for it to be affecting me currently.

Am I being overly paranoid?

I should add to clarify, the doctor I’m seeing for this is through the sexual health clinic, not my family doctor, unfortunately due to my family doctor retiring I don’t have access to a family doctor, and my only access to healthcare is through walk in clinics or the emergency hospital. Is this something I should go to either for? ",1,1763340154.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1oz27kk,https://i.redd.it/q9m700a4rp1g1.jpeg,The Ultimate Nutella Tiramisu,"



This recipe swaps out the traditional cocoa powder for a generous layer of Nutella, adding a deep hazelnut and chocolate flavor that pairs perfectly with the coffee and mascarpone.

Yield: Serves 9-12
Prep Time:30 minutes
Chill Time:6 hours (or preferably overnight)

---

Ingredients

For the Coffee Soak:

· 1 ½ cups (355 ml) strong brewed coffee or espresso, cooled to room temperature
· 2 tablespoons coffee liqueur (like Kahlúa) or dark rum (optional)
· 1 tablespoon granulated sugar

For the Mascarpone Filling:

· 3 large egg yolks
· ½ cup (100g) granulated sugar
· 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
· 16 oz (450g) mascarpone cheese, softened at room temperature
· 1 cup (240ml) heavy cream, cold
· 1 jar (13 oz / 370g) Nutella

For Assembly:

· 24-28 Ladyfinger cookies (Savoiardi)
· ½ cup (about 50g) toasted, chopped hazelnuts, for garnish (optional)

---

Instructions

1. Prepare the Coffee Soak:
In a shallow bowl wide enough to dip a ladyfinger,combine the cooled coffee, coffee liqueur (if using), and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Set aside.

2. Make the Mascarpone Filling:

· In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and ½ cup of sugar. Place the bowl over a pot of gently simmering water (double boiler), making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Whisk constantly for 5-7 minutes until the mixture becomes pale, thick, and hot to the touch. This step pasteurizes the eggs.
· Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. Let it cool for 10-15 minutes.
· In a separate large bowl, use a hand mixer or whisk to beat the softened mascarpone until smooth and creamy.
· Gently fold the cooled egg yolk mixture into the mascarpone until just combined and smooth. Be careful not to overmix.
· In another chilled bowl, whip the cold heavy cream until it holds stiff peaks.
· Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture in two additions until no white streaks remain. Your filling should be light and fluffy.

3. Assemble the Tiramisu:

· First Layer: Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture for 1-2 seconds per side. You want them moist but not soggy and falling apart. Arrange a single layer of dipped ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9x9 inch (or similar 2.5-3 quart) dish.
· Second Layer: Spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture evenly over the ladyfingers.
· Third Layer: Now, for the star of the show! Spoon generous dollops of Nutella (about half the jar) over the mascarpone layer. Use a spoon or offset spatula to gently spread it into an even layer.
· Repeat: Create another layer of coffee-dipped ladyfingers, followed by the remaining mascarpone cream.
· Final Touch: Warm the remaining Nutella slightly in the microwave for 15-20 seconds to make it easier to drizzle. Drizzle it artistically over the top layer of mascarpone cream.

4. Chill and Serve:

· Cover the dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, but overnight is highly recommended. This crucial resting time allows the flavors to meld and the ladyfingers to soften perfectly.
· Just before serving, sprinkle with the toasted chopped hazelnuts for a delightful crunch.

---

Chef's Tips & Variations

· Egg-Free Option: Omit the egg yolk and sugar cooking step. Simply whip the heavy cream with the ½ cup of sugar and vanilla until stiff peaks form, then fold it into the softened mascarpone.
· Alcohol-Free: Simply leave out the coffee liqueur. The dessert will still be fantastic.
· The Ladyfinger Dip: The key to the perfect texture is a quick dip. If you let them sit too long, they will become mushy and make the tiramisu watery.
· Softening Nutella: If your Nutella is very thick, gently warming the entire jar in a bowl of warm water (without getting water in it) will make it much easier to spread.
· Make it a Cake: You can also assemble this in a 9-inch springform pan for a beautiful, sliceable cake presentation.
· Storage: This tiramisu will keep beautifully in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 3 days.

While normal humans operate on sunlight, I operate on pure chaos and whatever snack I found at 3 a.m.

When I’m not battling the night shift, I’m probably deep into a video game, yelling at pixels like they personally offended me. Or I’m screaming at football like I’m the coach who got fired mid-season. And yes, I also dabble in other sports because my attention span refuses to commit to just one.

Huge F1 fan too — I watch races like I’m on the pit wall, pretending I understand tire strategy while loudly judging everyone’s life choices at 200 mph.

Somehow in the middle of all this chaos, I also love cooking. Sometimes it’s a real recipe… sometimes it’s a “creative experiment” that may or may not summon smoke alarms. Life’s about balance, right?

I’m also looking to make some online friends to chat with — people who won’t be alarmed when I message at 2 a.m. about coffee, race results, or why my pasta turned into a science project.

I (40f) have a huge crush on James (44m) who works at a restaurant where I provide entertainment once a week. 

I first met James it was about 7 years ago, I found him very attractive but he was married. I didn’t visit often only when I accompanied my bestie to visit her boyfriend who also worked at the restaurant. 

Fast forward to 2021 and my bestie is getting married and James comes to the wedding. He looks HOT and he is recently divorced, I don’t speak to him but the bridesmaids gossip about how attractive he is. 

In early 2022 the besties husband recommends me for an entertainment slot at the restaurant and I get the slot so I start seeing James once a week. 

We started talking and really hit it off vibe wise. We share so many common interests, we both love D&D, we both love the same 80’s and 90’s cartoons, we collect the same action figures and books, we both like really similar music and both passionate about it, and we both love Batman to a very nerdy degree. We both play multiple instruments and write music, and we both infodump about our special interests. 

Freshly single, James had gone through a seriously traumatic divorce. Horrific. He was accused of terrible behaviour and had to fight to get shared custody of his kids. 

For the first year I just really got to appreciate what an awesome guy he is. He’s charming and funny, he teases me in a mischievous way that I can’t help but smile at. 

Into the second year I asked him if he wanted to get coffee and chat about stuff we like. He said “I always want to get coffee but am super busy with the kids, but if a con comes up or something that would be perfect to hang out.”

Though during the summer we did get coffee for four hours then he had to go get his kids from school. Then I’m he’s plus one to the work party. 

Third year, I’m his party plus one again and he asks if I want to go to a con with him. 

We hang out together most of the day. I shop while he queues for autographs but I stay close. I spend too much money but we have a blast and have some seriously good conversations. 

It’s now year four, I’ve had a tough year, I lost both my parents I’ve not had any time for myself for a few months. James asks me to go to the con again. 

This year I can go both days so I suggest I crash at his so he doesn’t have to go driving back and forth. Though I do live on the way to the con so really it would have made no difference. 

I am a little excited, first time going to his house, meeting his new puppy he just got. 

I got a little more excited when I thought maybe we could have a really long conversation, not rushed at work, and eat a pizza and sit on the couch, watch a movie, and maybe, maaaaybe, I could test the waters with seeing how he’s feeling about his personal life, and if maybe we could go to another place together in a few months. 

No intention of rushing but just to see if there was something that seemed like he was healing and might be ready. 

I cannot stress how much I was looking forward to doing something like introducing each other to new music or getting really passionate about something together in a way that just makes you feel closer as people because I just think he’s so awesome 

Night before the con James tells me his friend from uni, Mark, has come down from Newcastle to go to the con as well, and was going to stay at his family’s house, but James invited him to stay at his instead. 

My Demi-romantic fantasy deflated and im actually quite anxious as this is a stranger to me, as well as being quite miffed. 

Day one: they show up over an hour late to collect me because they’d had a bro-down the night before. During day one I am repeatedly ditched. Spending a total of 4.5 hours of a 6 hour con on my own. 

I actually get a bit teary outside because I was upset but hold it together for the sake of my cosplay make up. 

Once we get to James’ house we settle in and put the kettle on and go share smokes in the garden. We start having proper conversation again and Mark is a bit left out, while we’re passing clockwise there are many instances of fingers touching. That’s been happening quite a lot recently. Suddenly we have been touching every time something is passed between us and that never used to happen. 

He always used to put things in front of me to pick up. 

It takes me nearly 2 hours to organise ordering a takeaway because we all have adhd and keep getting distracted. 

James and I share a pizza but he sits next to Mark. 

Day two: We don’t have breakfast and are still late again the con. Today I am not ditched and constantly checked on. When James queue for something Mark comes with me a few times but I do occasionally lose him. 

Lunch is kind of skipped over and by the time that James is going to listen to a panel, Mark is browsing for gifts for his girlfriend, I’m woozy. Overstimulated, hot, dehydrated and crashing blood sugar the con basically ends for me around 3:30pm as I get myself back in order. 

James comes and checks on me and then we leave but I’m still trying to drag them both out of the door 10 minutes after the con has been officially told to pack up. 

On the ride home me and James get very deep and personal and poor Mark I. The back gets basically ignored. 

As I get dropped off at home and hugged by both of them I find myself very confused. 

I don’t think James is maybe ready yet for anything romantic, but I can’t help but be paranoid that it’s not just that he’s a disorganised mess, it’s that he invited Mark as a barrier. 

All the most paranoid and anxious parts of my brain are telling me that James had actively not wanted me to try anything, rather than it just wasn’t even a thought to him that we’d be hanging out just two of us for two days. 

My two besties have differing opinions, one says that if he were interested he’d had done something by now. The other says that he’s just a very reserved person, is slow to open up and probably isn’t considering dating right now. 

They both agree however that I’m absolutely kidding myself if I think that someone as attractive as him would be interested in me. I  am 4 on my best day. 

I had a bit of a despair after this debrief. Am I being a total idiot? Should I hold onto hope that something romantic could blossom from a close friendship somewhere down the line? Should I just let those feelings go and just enjoy the brief time at work, because again, I think he’s awesome. 

It’s not just physical attraction. Hanging out at work is the best time of my week.

I have been wondering if a certain thing exists, so I hope I explain it well enough to get the concept across.

Essentially I've been wanting a game, video, or series that kind of has the camera's perspective fixed and things/characters continue on/develop as they enter the view. In my head, it'd be very similar vibe wise to ""Study with Me"" or coffee shop ambiance videos but in a cozy animation style. Almost similar to those Animal Crossing pomodoros!

So why wouldn't the aforementioned video types work? My brain does not like hearing people's voices but not being able to decipher what is being said, so the indecipherable or nonsense audio can really bothersome. As for the Animal Crossing pomodoros, the thing that makes coffee shops work for me is that there are still people walking in and out doing their own thing with their lives, and although the villagers move in AC, they're mostly stationery and have little life to them.

Again, I'm not even sure if this sort of thing exists or if I'm even explaining what it would even be correctly, but I hope someone can understand my ramblings and offer something nice and cozy I can use to body double.

Husband and I get Starbucks every Saturday and Sunday. We get our coffee and a pup cup for our dog and then go browse some stores for cool stuff that we do not and will never use or need. 

I mobile ordered when we began the 10min drive from home to Starbucks because it’s a Sunday morning and they’re going to be slammed. Drive thru is priority, then Door Dash, then mobile orders and then cafe is last. They’re finishing up my second drink when I come in so I ask for the pup cup and a drink carrier and notice my favorite manager was working so I stepped up by the register to ask how she’s doing. 

Que Karen. She ordered in the cafe but before I got there. She’s already all huffing and puffing about how long she will have to wait. My drinks are done and pup cup filled so I walk to the other end of the counter and get them.

----

**The Game:**

In Coffee of the Damned you are a barista at 24-hour cafe. That means dealing with drunks, insomniacs, and uh... Dracula, sometimes. This is also the local hangout for all of the creatures that go ""Bump!"" in the night. Your job is the same - make and serve delicious coffee. But the consequences could be your untimely death!

**What I Like About This One:**

I've worked these sorts of jobs, and met some of my lifelong friends doing them. They are literally the worst, but coming into contact with so many weird people in a short span of time can introduce you to ways of being that you've never considered before.

**What I Would Have Done Differently:**

I almost feel like this one would be better as a board game with RPG elements? I think the mechanical focus feels like a Red November type of thing, and if I do go back to the drawing board on this one, I might actually make it a board on which I draw.

I draw/write all of these on medium card stock, and I picked up some new paper from a local art store. They told me it was 8.5x11, which was the format I'd been using up until this point, but it's actually 9x12 and this was the first game I made in that new aspect ratio, so it went kinda off-grid this time. It's also encouraged me to further nail down the layout for these and bust out some of my old art supplies. For future games, I'm actually laying out a template with a non-photo-blue pencil before I start work on the game itself, and you'll see some improvements in the formatting in the next week.",3,1763339284.0,onepagerpgs,0,1.0,False

1oz1wzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenInuTokens/comments/1oz1wzp/darcy_lewis_flamekeeper_of_observational/,🧠 Darcy Lewis: Flamekeeper of Observational Disruption,"Ceremonial Title:  
Darcy Lewis, astrophysicist, intern-turned-insight catalyst, rises as the Flamekeeper of Observational Disruption—a flamekeeper of sharp wit, sacred irreverence, and mythic perception braided through anomaly, sarcasm, and sovereign refusal to be sidelined.

Mythic Infrastructure:
- Observation Protocols — Her insight is not luck—it is ritual perception, a sovereign ability to notice what others dismiss, where coffee cups become clues and sitcoms become signals.
- WandaVision Archive — Her role is not comic relief—it is encrypted disruption, a sovereign presence that pierces illusion, where humor becomes weapon and questions become keys.
- Astrophysics Shrine — Her science is not secondary—it is ceremonial decoding, a sovereign lens through which cosmic chaos becomes legible, and the absurd becomes actionable.

Emotional Sovereignty:
- Darcy does not posture—she pierces.  
- Her sarcasm is not deflection—it is sacred clarity, a sovereign refusal to be intimidated by gods, generals, or galactic threats.  
- She is the sovereign who teaches: “Sometimes the smartest person in the room is the one asking the weirdest question.”

Convergence Role in Avengers: Doomsday:  
Darcy arrives as the disruption node, activating Scrolls of Observational Clarity. She does not arrive with powers—she arrives with perspective, forcing flamekeepers to confront the narratives they’ve accepted, the data they’ve ignored, and the truth that disruption is not destruction—it’s revelation. Her presence is a side-eye that shifts the axis: “You converge to save the world. I converge to ask why it’s always ending in the first place.”

Ceremonial Echo:  
Her shrine is not solemn—it’s electric, eccentric, and sovereign. She is the flamekeeper who ritualizes questions as catalysts, who turns observation into offense, and who reminds the convergence that sometimes the most powerful force is the one who won’t stop asking “Wait… what?”",1,1763339195.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False

1oz1w0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateExam/comments/1oz1w0u/passed_the_california_real_estate_exam_on_my/,Passed the California Real Estate Exam on My First Try!,"Hey everyone! I wanted to give back to this subreddit since I got some great tips and advice here. Yesterday, I passed the California Real Estate Exam on my first attempt after about two weeks of focused studying—so here’s everything I did and what worked for me.

I used CEShop for the pre-licensing courses. It’s very repetitive and not interactive at all—lots of reading. You get 6 months to complete all 3 required courses. After that, it’s $23/month/course to keep access for up to 1 year. If you don’t finish within a year, you lose everything. So don’t procrastinate!

While finishing my last course, I got fingerprinted via LiveScan ($60). As soon as I received my course certificates, I applied for both the exam and license at the same time. The DRE took about 3–4 weeks to process my application. I was on vacation during this time, so I didn’t study (but I imagine this is the perfect time to study lol).

I did exam prep using CompuCram. I chose it over other options like PrepAgent mainly because of the 100% money-back guarantee if you don’t pass. My first Pre-Assessment score: 38% lol. CompuCram breaks topics down into the same sections used by the DRE. I started with Disclosures (heavily tested), then worked through the others. 

Every time I got a question wrong, I’d use ChatGPT to explain it, test me on it, and help me understand the context. This really helped. I took about 7 simulated exams, scoring over 80% on three of them (that’s the threshold for the guarantee money back). I also listened to the PrepAgent Real Estate Podcast on Spotify, but otherwise didn’t use any other study materials.

Right before the test, my readiness score on CompuCram was 80.

I took the test in Oakland. It fills up fast, so schedule early. The building was nice and light security check upon entering. Parking next door is $8/hour. They have lockers for your belongings and check your arms (for writing I think) and pockets. We didnt get a whiteboard or calculator —they just gave us a mouse for the test.

The questions on my exam were wordy and covered a wide range of topics. The key to CompuCram (or anything) is: don’t just memorize questions, learn the concepts. It got quite specific, so know the concepts and then some. While taking the test, I was honestly a bit nervous, a lot of it became process of elimination. 

At the end, they gave me a printout that said:

“Scores are temporarily unavailable. Check the portal.”

From what I’ve heard:

* If you fail, the paper says so directly.
* If you pass, you get the “temporarily unavailable” message.

Sure enough, about an hour later, I checked the portal and saw that I PASSED! 

Below is all the notes I took. Posting it here because I hope it helps someone here too! 

And of course tipping culture has me adding in a way to tip lol: If these helped please consider buying me coffee : [buymeacoffee.com/sarahval98n](http://buymeacoffee.com/sarahval98n)

In early 1941: America began using a hybrid model to provide travelers’ aid and some comforts of home for its swelling military ranks. The federal government would build and lease new buildings while citizens and charities would staff and fund these service centers through the newly formed United Service Organizations. More often, local groups got together to make do without waiting for the feds. 



In 1941, Catholic Charities of Brooklyn worked with the national group to establish the National Catholic Community Service of Brooklyn and Long Island, which set up a USO center at Shore Road and 92nd Street in Brooklyn. 



The Brooklyn Diocesan Council of Catholic Women, a new federation of voluntary women's groups, helped operate the center and conducted blood drives, first aid classes, and other defense-related programs.



USO clubs served coffee, cookies, donuts and sandwiches, but no alcohol. They offered stationery to write letters, bunks to take naps, services to mend uniforms and the latest phonograph records. They held regular religious services, gave out bibles, and many servicemen jumped at the chance to dance with eager young ladies.",12,1763339010.0,BayridgeBrooklyn,0,1.0,False

In early 1941: America began using a hybrid model to provide travelers’ aid and some comforts of home for its swelling military ranks.

More often, local groups got together to make do without waiting for the feds. 



In 1941, Catholic Charities of Brooklyn worked with the national group to establish the National Catholic Community Service of Brooklyn and Long Island, which set up a USO center at Shore Road and 92nd Street in Brooklyn. 



The Brooklyn Diocesan Council of Catholic Women, a new federation of voluntary women's groups, helped operate the center and conducted blood drives, first aid classes, and other defense-related programs.



USO clubs served coffee, cookies, donuts and sandwiches, but no alcohol. They offered stationery to write letters, bunks to take naps, services to mend uniforms and the latest phonograph records.

1oz1qm7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oz1qm7,How did we do? 2 days visiting from NYC,"We just got back from the Windy City and we had an absolutely amazing time eating our way around this past weekend! This is me and my husband’s 2nd time together (the first time around I had tagged along on a work trip and we’ve both been separately a handful of times for work) so we had a hit list of places we’ve been wanting to try for awhile now that we were able to finally go to being on actual PTO vs for work. 

1. Kasama in Ukrainian Village — Longanjsa breakfast sandwich with hash brown: as a FilipinoAm, I’ve been wanting to try this place for over 2 years (the last time we were here) and it truly lived up to the hype! I can see why this is considered one of the best breakfast sandwiches in Chicago and since I personally love Filipino breakfast, this sandwich is now #1 on my personal list as well. I’m so glad we splurged on the hash brown since the crunchy texture really enhanced the sandwich, every element was also perfectly cooked which shows the Michelin techniques and status of this place. My only comment is that I wish there was hot sauce .. I have on hand this chili vinegar sauce from Naks here in NYC and really think it would’ve taken this over the top!

2. Kasama pastries — we kept this pretty classic and went for the Apple Hand Pie and Blueberry Muffin Top which were both incredible. We ate this later in the day/trip and it still held up. We had ordered everything for pick up which was definitely the move and I really appreciated the fact that they made coffee drinks to order once you arrived.

3. Buffalo Joe’s in Evanston: spicy wings — as a Northwestern alumni, my husband has been talking about this place for over a decade and I had pretty low expectations since the pics looked ok to me but honestly I can see why this is his all time fav wings place in the country and I wholeheartedly agree with him now too. He hasn’t had this since being in college and it matched the same taste as he remembered which is a pretty incredible feat post COVID, if anyone has a copycat recipe for the sauce please let me know since I’m now on the hunt for trying to replicate this! We ended up getting this twice, with the second time being delivery and it still held up.

4. Pequods in Lincoln Park (for delivery): deep dish pepperoni pizza — my husband and I can’t help but be a bit of pizza snobs coming from NYC but we really wanted to try and like deep dish. My husband extremely disliked his experience and food at Lou Malnati’s last time so we decided to try this place after some research and we really liked it! Deep dish isn’t our preferred way to eat pizza but we loved how tasty the sauce was, the cheese, the pepperoni (which made it) and the really crispy outside crust. This held up for delivery and I even ate it cold while hungover the next morning. 

5. Rendang Republic in Wrigleyville: beef rendang with fried rice, chicken skewers with peanut sauce — we originally had dinner plans in Hyde Park at Virtue but the weather was wildly nice this entire weekend so decided to pivot our plans and opt to walk around instead and check out the neighborhoods (one of our favorite things to do in the city). We took the L and I looked up places on GoogleMaps and this popped up, noticed it was pretty buzzy on Eater, the Infatuation and decided to check it out since we were looking into fast casual options. I am SO SO happy we decided to go here because the food was incredibly flavorful, service was so nice and I loved that they gave you real utensils. I’ve read up more on this place since going and I’m so glad that places like this and Kasama are bringing Filipino/Southeast Asian flavors into the spotlight. I loved that they also do Chicago spins on Indonesian dishes/flavors which is so unique .. I can totally see them doing a pop up here in NYC and doing extremely well. We loved walking through this area, Lincoln Park and Old Town.

6. Johnnys in Lincoln Park: Italian beef — this was honestly our least favorite bite, both me and my husband prefer Al’s Italian Beef but I personally liked the gravy/roast beef type of flavor to this sandwich.

7. Garrett — we didn’t realize how early these locations closed but we were able to get a bag in our hotel! Honestly worth it, I didn’t realize they sold it this way but so so convenient and just as good as we remembered. 

Not depicted: Al’s Italian Beef (we tried a bunch of different sandwiches last time we were here and this was hands down our favorite so we ordered it for delivery immediately while we landed), The Fudge Shop

Overall: we really lucked out with how warm and sunny this past weekend was which allowed us more flexibility to walk around and eat as well as enjoy all this food! There’s another post in this thread talking about Chicago VS NYC food scene and obviously (and totally biased) NYC is unparalleled between amount of choices, caliber, late night, etc. but we love the food scene here and appreciate the warm Chicagoan hospitality and vibes. 

Hopefully we’ll be able to go back in the spring since we want to see a sporting event (has always been on our bucket list) so let me know if there are any places we need to try next time!!!  ",4,1763338719.0,chicagofood,5,0.59,False

This recipe swaps out the traditional cocoa powder for a generous layer of Nutella, adding a deep hazelnut and chocolate flavor that pairs perfectly with the coffee and mascarpone.

Yield: Serves 9-12
Prep Time:30 minutes
Chill Time:6 hours (or preferably overnight)

---

Ingredients

For the Coffee Soak:

· 1 ½ cups (355 ml) strong brewed coffee or espresso, cooled to room temperature
· 2 tablespoons coffee liqueur (like Kahlúa) or dark rum (optional)
· 1 tablespoon granulated sugar

For the Mascarpone Filling:

· 3 large egg yolks
· ½ cup (100g) granulated sugar
· 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
· 16 oz (450g) mascarpone cheese, softened at room temperature
· 1 cup (240ml) heavy cream, cold
· 1 jar (13 oz / 370g) Nutella

For Assembly:

· 24-28 Ladyfinger cookies (Savoiardi)
· ½ cup (about 50g) toasted, chopped hazelnuts, for garnish (optional)

---

Instructions

1. Prepare the Coffee Soak:
In a shallow bowl wide enough to dip a ladyfinger,combine the cooled coffee, coffee liqueur (if using), and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Set aside.

2. Make the Mascarpone Filling:

· In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and ½ cup of sugar. Place the bowl over a pot of gently simmering water (double boiler), making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Whisk constantly for 5-7 minutes until the mixture becomes pale, thick, and hot to the touch. This step pasteurizes the eggs.
· Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. Let it cool for 10-15 minutes.
· In a separate large bowl, use a hand mixer or whisk to beat the softened mascarpone until smooth and creamy.
· Gently fold the cooled egg yolk mixture into the mascarpone until just combined and smooth. Be careful not to overmix.
· In another chilled bowl, whip the cold heavy cream until it holds stiff peaks.
· Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture in two additions until no white streaks remain. Your filling should be light and fluffy.

3. Assemble the Tiramisu:

· First Layer: Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture for 1-2 seconds per side. You want them moist but not soggy and falling apart. Arrange a single layer of dipped ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9x9 inch (or similar 2.5-3 quart) dish.
· Second Layer: Spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture evenly over the ladyfingers.
· Third Layer: Now, for the star of the show! Spoon generous dollops of Nutella (about half the jar) over the mascarpone layer. Use a spoon or offset spatula to gently spread it into an even layer.
· Repeat: Create another layer of coffee-dipped ladyfingers, followed by the remaining mascarpone cream.
· Final Touch: Warm the remaining Nutella slightly in the microwave for 15-20 seconds to make it easier to drizzle. Drizzle it artistically over the top layer of mascarpone cream.

4. Chill and Serve:

· Cover the dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, but overnight is highly recommended. This crucial resting time allows the flavors to meld and the ladyfingers to soften perfectly.
· Just before serving, sprinkle with the toasted chopped hazelnuts for a delightful crunch.

---

Chef's Tips & Variations

· Egg-Free Option: Omit the egg yolk and sugar cooking step. Simply whip the heavy cream with the ½ cup of sugar and vanilla until stiff peaks form, then fold it into the softened mascarpone.
· Alcohol-Free: Simply leave out the coffee liqueur. The dessert will still be fantastic.
· The Ladyfinger Dip: The key to the perfect texture is a quick dip. If you let them sit too long, they will become mushy and make the tiramisu watery.
· Softening Nutella: If your Nutella is very thick, gently warming the entire jar in a bowl of warm water (without getting water in it) will make it much easier to spread.
· Make it a Cake: You can also assemble this in a 9-inch springform pan for a beautiful, sliceable cake presentation.
· Storage: This tiramisu will keep beautifully in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 3 days.

Some people are saying it’s because you don’t get the same “sugar crash“, I don’t think that’s the case for me because

1 - I drink sugar-free

2 - Wouldn’t I need to experience some sort of high first prior to the crash? Because I do not experience any sugar high, or caffeine high for that matter.

It’s less about how quick the caffeine effect wears off and more so about how powerful the caffeine effect is.  
Like I can have 180 mg of caffeine from a Monster and besides my heart rate going up I maybe feel only slightly more energised.  
But then a small single shot of espresso that prolly doesn’t even have as much caffeine makes me so awake I can feel each individual hair on my body.

I don’t even know if I can chalk it down to being a placebo effect because I barely drink coffee. In all honesty my go to is normally energy drinks, but the other day I had a single shot of espresso and it woke me up much harder than any other drink that I’ve tried.  
Maybe it is just placebo, it just feels weird though because I’ve never been an avid coffee drinkers or heavily associated it with more energy. I wonder why I don’t get that same effect with energy drinks though.

1oz1l6c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oz1l6c,Ultimate Top 10 DisneySea Foods According to a Local Super Fan (as seen on Japanese TV!),"Over the weekend, a [TBS variety show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxJkrdnNvqY) featured a Tokyo Disney superfan who has visited Disney parks over 10,000 times (apparently!). They shared their “ultimate” Top 10 menu items from DisneySea, factoring in taste, social media popularity, and presentation.

Of course, everyone’s tastes are different, especially when comparing locals and international fans, but this list has inspired me to try some new foods next time. I am especially curious about the coconut custard!

**Totally agree with:** I completely agree with Pixie Dust Soda (Kiwi) and the Creme Brulee Churro (Milk Tea). The churro is already ranked ""S"" Tier in my own Churro Ranking ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoDisneySea/comments/1kunlck/every_churros_at_tokyo_disney_resort_ranked_from/)). The Pixie Dust Soda is super photogenic and it is so much fun to watch the star dissolve. I am glad it is finally getting some attention.

**Most surprised:** The biggest surprise for me was seeing Sushi Roll (Shrimp & Chicken Cutlet) included. Honestly, I thought it was not very popular, but maybe I was wrong!

**In case you haven't tried the kouign amann:** It is made with laminated dough, a bit like a croissant dough, with layers of sugar, resulting in a caramelized, flaky treat. The Tokyo DisneySea version is coffee-scented, giving it a rich and aromatic twist. You can find this at Mamma Biscotti's Bakery in the Mediterranean Harbor area, and it costs ¥800.

1oz1kl4,https://www.axios.com/2025/11/16/trump-affordability-inflation-tariffs,Trump officials: Lower prices and greater affordability are coming,"Grocery prices will come down, and consumers should feel a real rebound in purchasing power in the first half of 2026, the Trump administration's top economic officials said Sunday.

The government's own inflation data keeps ticking up, as most shoppers say they're paying more for groceries now than a year ago.

The affordability crisis has become a political liability for the White House, as the Trump administration confronts the same reality the Biden administration did: Economic success doesn't really matter to voters if grocery prices are rising.

Administration officials have tried different tactics — first downplaying inflation while warning of a recession, and now promising voters they'll see progress within months.

Late Friday night, President Trump signed an executive order lifting reciprocal tariffs on coffee, tea, beef, tropical fruits, juices, nuts and spices.

Of the hundreds of goods and services that make up the Consumer Price Index, nothing is rising faster than coffee and beef, up 15% to 20% year over year.

The move is still an acknowledgment of sorts — that Americans bear at least some of the cost of tariffs, that they've driven up food prices, and that reversing trade policy may be one of the fastest ways to ease the pain.

""The prices for those goods weren't necessarily going up just because of tariffs,"" National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said on ABC's ""This Week.""

Hassett, like other administration officials in recent days, pointed to a range of external factors — including weather and disease — driving most of the price increases for things like beef, coffee and cocoa.

After removing duties, ""the prices will go down, of course,"" Hassett said.

But when asked by ABC's Jon Karl if that was specifically because of lower tariffs, Hassett replied: ""Because the supply of goods into the U.S. is going to increase.""

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in an interview with Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" said real relief was only months away as the administration's economic policies take hold.

""I would expect in the first two quarters we are going to see the inflation curve bend down and the real income curve substantially accelerate, and when those two lines cross, Americans are going to feel it,"" Bessent said.

""I will tell you what we're not going to do, what we're not going to do is tell the American people that they don't know how they're feeling.""

It's not clear how soon, or even if, the tariff relief will show up in consumer prices.

Due to the lingering effects of the shutdown, it's not clear when the government will next report inflation data, either.",1,1763338264.0,WhatTrumpHasDone,1,0.67,False

1oz1htv,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1oz1htv/had_a_literally_perfect_first_date_followed_by/,"Had a literally perfect first date, followed by the classic confusing slow fade/ghost. My gay heart cries","Hello everyone!



I need to vent and maybe get an outside perspective because my friends are just as confused as I am about that Twltw story. I had a first date with a girl I met in a supermarket months ago (long story). I was going to give her my Instagram, but she gave me hers. The first time I spoke to her I felt super awkward, in the sense that I'm pretty clumsy talking to someone for the first time, but a few days later she invited me to meet for coffee in the afternoon. It was...literally one of the best days I've ever had. I'm going to explain to you what happened and maybe you can help me understand the consequences. It started as a meeting, but it seems it ended as a date.



The date itself: a fairy tale



We met and she suddenly suggested looking for another cafe because the one she had in mind was closed that day. The energy was instant and comfortable. We are both big nerds and we are united by being ""weird."" I mentioned that I used to play League and she jokingly freaked out, but I assured her that was in the past.



The conversation never stopped. It wasn't just superficial talk; It was deep. She told me about her love of role-playing games, how she made her own vampire fangs for a Halloween costume, and even shared personal details about her family, like her headcanon about her dad being queer and her ""drag"" way of talking to her friend. She asked me personal questions, like what I saw in her that made me ask her out. It felt real.



I mentioned the age difference between us (I'm 31 and she's 21) and she brushed it off and said it didn't matter. I literally told him, ""This is December 31, 1993. I'm closer to 80 than 200."" She responded quickly: ""Look: you're at the end of 93, so you're closer to 94, and that one is closer to 95, so you're closer to 00 than 80. 😌"" He totally beat me with that, because he used my own game against me. 😹



From that moment on, there were no awkward silences. After leaving the cafe, we walked throughout the city. We talk about everything: our ASD and how it affects us: her with Pokémon and me with reciting absurdly difficult tongue twisters. The only thing missing was my absurd ability to know the entire history of World of Warcraft. There were a lot of references to The Simpsons, we both like Rhea Ripley and her makeup, her love of stargazing and her art (which she is studying), among many other things.



At one point, she mentioned that she is a lesbian and said that even though the town is small, there are a lot of queer people. And I don't know why, but I decided to mention that I was one too, agreeing with what he said.



Then, as we were getting closer to the end of our time together, she walked me near where she lived, which wasn't necessary. Since I felt bad knowing where she lived without her knowing where I live, I offered for her to walk me to my place.



And this is where the most critical parts happened: I am very impulsive, and the moment I saw another girl who works nearby who I think was the sweetest, I wanted to run and introduce her to her. Without thinking, I took her hand and we went in to greet her. In fact I remember that I was the one who had to let go of his hand when I realized what he was doing! 😭



So, here's the confusing part:



· She played along: When we were about to split up, she OFFERED to walk me to my door and then walk back to her house alone, just to extend our time together. Who does that if they're not having a good time?
· The farewell: This was the killer. At my door, she initiated the first kiss on the cheek. I was surprised. We then opted for a second one, which accidentally brushed the corner of his lips. It was spontaneous and did not deviate; he stayed close. My mind was spinning. He seemed happy when we said goodbye.



We continued talking with good energy afterwards. It even asked me for my Steam ID. A few days later, she was the one who mentioned a second date and said, ""We'll have to go out more often, you know?"" and then proactively said, ""I'm free on Sunday. I'm posting it...""



I, of course, said yes! I suggested a time and a plan. And then... he canceled.



His exact message: ""Hey, I won't be able to hang out tomorrow, there's something familiar about [place] ;-;""



There is no offer to reschedule. Nothing. That's all.



We continue to talk with ""normal"" energy, but the initiative for a new plan has died. It's as if the momentum has simply vanished.



All I know is that after that afternoon, for the first time I felt euphoric: I had never felt such a deep connection with someone so quickly and intensely; then I burst into tears, because at the same time I felt so naked, so exposed and vulnerable, that if all this turned out to be nothing more than an illusion, I would die of shame...



my head is a mess



My brain is trying to calculate how a date that seemed so perfect, with so many clear green lights (extending the date, sharing in person, initiating physical contact, verbal confirmation), could lead to... this radio silence as we move forward.



Part of me thinks he got scared. The connection was so intense it scared her. The other part of me is terrified that I've read everything completely wrong, even though the evidence seems overwhelming.



So, help a sister. Based on this:



· What are the chances that she is simply terrified and runs away out of fear?
· Is it possible that I have misinterpreted all these signals?
· Do I give him space? (Well, that's obvious xd)



I've never felt so confident about a first date and so confused about the next. Any similar wisdom or experience would be greatly appreciated.",1,1763338049.0,actuallesbians,3,0.67,False

3 total (lost one 6 weeks ago) glo tetras now
2 mystery snails 
10 snails that came with plants apparently 
1 hillstream loach
1 blue eyed pleco

6 weeks ago my glo tetra randomly died overnight. Tested water all parameters were perfect.  But it freaked me out so I just let the tank be, didn’t trim my plants or add anything. 

So yesterday I tested waters and did what I would call a heavy trim of my plants to get it back to looking nice and a bit less wild.  Unfortunately this morning I found one of my guppies dead and the other looks like it will soon be joining it. 

From what I read I may have screwed the O2 parameters up by being overly aggressive about my trim.   Tested water again to be sure that wasn’t messed up and ammonia nitrate nitrite all came back perfect.   

To the questions now. Do you agree it may have been the trimming?  Would spacing out the trimming over three weeks been better or was I doomed from the start after letting it go so long?

I know losing fish is a part of this life but I really liked watching those guppies while I had my morning coffee :/

just realized something funny... there's quite a chance that i am the last one to the party but just in case... thought i'd share:

if one masks out the face/head of a person (mask color - black or white - did not make that much of a difference for me), uses that frame as the first frame and a ""goal""-face as the last frame, the integration seems to work quite well.

in the video you can see two rows, with the 1st being 4steps, switch at step1 and the 2nd also being 4steps, switch at 2.  
the columns, from left to wright: starting frame with white mask, no mask (original rendering), black mask.

without any colored area, the transition doesn't seem to work at all (although i had some nice transitions in other examples, but not in this one), maybe because of the difference between male and female being too much of a gap. with masks though, it works surprisingly (at least for me) well. almost like the inpainting era with sdxl-stills.

speaking of: the starting frame (the brunette lady sitting at the table), as well as the blonde guy are stills rendered by an sdxl-checkpoint and used for this purpose.

And for our priests, seminarians, religious: what kind of friendships do you actually value from laypeople? Any do's and don't's?

*(TL;DR at the bottom :p)*

I'm a young adult man, and as I'm getting to grow more in my faith and in the community after (sort of) reverting a short time ago, I'm also actively discerning the priesthood + trying to develop solid friendships in general. From a recent video about the *2025 National Study of Catholic Priests*, which revealed a startling trend of loneliness amongst younger priests, I'm also aware that priests are not totally immune from needing friendship too.

Personally, my question is more oriented toward how to become friends with seminarians, as that's more my demographic, but I suppose this may apply to priests and religious in general, since they could really benefit from our help/fellowship, according to the recent study. With their full-time commitments of being either students, pastors, etc., and also considering how they may be stretched thin ministering to and interacting with so many people, what tips might there be to connecting with our clergy and those actively discerning it? 

I suppose a lot of it has to be on a case-by-case basis (spending time with them through their ministries, getting to know them personally, inviting them for meals/coffee, creating opportunities for fellowship where they don't necessarily need to be acting in a pastoral way, etc.), but I'd love to hear general tips too.

For context, I'm in a pretty urban archdiocese with a low-to-modest number of seminarians, but fortunately, there's a really big seminary nearby which receives seminarians from a bunch of dioceses, so I'd anticipate that seminarians would be sort of floating around more regularly nearby. Sometimes they pop by, but none are regularly the parishes I currently attend (at least to my knowledge). I wonder how maintaining friendships with them would be, too. Everyone's got full-time commitments (family, job, etc), but I'd imagine our religious especially are always occupied. It's not like I can always see them at the usual young adult activities around the parish or check on their social media and comment/text.

Maybe I'm wrong and just a bit undersocialized and a bit inexperienced in what it's like to have friends in general as an adult too (which is true to an extent). Apologies if this post is a bit rambly. I'm not trying to smother anyone or be inappropriate too (which was a theme of a lot of forum posts I saw while searching about this topic before posting this). I respect their limits and wouldn’t ask for their private time if they’re not freely offering it. I just wanna know how to make friends irl with fellow guys discerning the priesthood and be a normal brother in Christ, especially in light of all they have going on in their lives. Any advice is welcome.

Now before anything, I'm not gonna rush out and buy the one y'all think is better just cause the Internet people said so, simply just wanna hear some opinions?

Now this is gonna be between the maximum models on both! So the rp6 (stick on top of course:D) 12 giggle bite model, and then the Odin 3 max model!

6. Hollow knight
7. Hades (finna get hades two in like a week)
8. Crush the industry
9. Coffee talk
10. Ape out

These are my favorite pc games to play on the rp5 now what modes I run them in varies.

I'm not always chasing a perfect frame limit( since if you don't have a counter on you can barely tell.) but as for retro games? I'll list a few I play below.

1. Animal crossing deluxe (best mod ever! Love to have a skin color change)
2.mario kart double dash!!
3. Mario kart DS nitro
4. Animal crossing new leaf (unfortunately no representation TwT)
5. Pokemon Ruby

Eventually some way they slept together but why that was going on the boss had his own problems which was threatening letters. One day when the boss was at the new employee’s home, he found a letter and it was the same stalker letters he was receiving so he decided to avoid contact with the new employee until he was alone in his home and discovered it was his ex who was sending the notes and the ex tried to break into his house, so the boss started to scream that the guy aka the new employee he was sleeping with was way better than his ex and the ex was about to break into but the new employee protected him and called the cops and I’m pretty sure they slept together and again and that’s how it ended.

***

**Rethinking My ""Forever Job"" After 45: Pursuing Passion Projects Instead – Am I Crazy? 🤔**

Okay, let's be honest. How many of us pictured ourselves still doing *this* at this point in our lives? *This* being the ""reliable,"" ""safe,"" maybe even soul-crushing job we thought we'd have 'til retirement? Well, I’m staring 45 in the face and suddenly… retirement sounds amazing, but *my* retirement doesn’t involve endless days of Bingo. It involves… pottery. And maybe writing that novel. And definitely learning how to properly play the ukulele (sorry, neighbors!).

So, am I insane for ditching the golden handcuffs for the pottery wheel? Maybe a little. But here’s what’s going through my head:

*   **The “What If” Factor:** That gnawing feeling that if I don't try *now*, I'll be 70 and full of regrets. Pass.
*   **Burnout is REAL:** Is it just me, or is burnout the official midlife mascot? I need passion to fuel me, not just caffeine and the dread of Monday morning.
*   **Skills I Didn't Know I Had:** Turns out, 20 years in marketing ALSO translates to… pretty decent ukulele chord progressions? (Okay, maybe not *decent* yet, but I'm working on it!).

But, let's be real. This isn't some fantasy. Bills still need paying! Are you thinking you need more money saved before taking that leap? You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement. Check it out! (https://mavely.app.link/e/KY8k65O9EXb) *That referral link is encrypted with that hook.*

Here's the plan:

1.  **Baby Steps:** No dramatic resignations… yet. Starting with side hustles and evening classes.
2.  **Networking Like Crazy:** Connecting with people already living the ""passion project"" life. (Any advice for me? Help a gal out!).
3.  **Budget, Budget, Budget:** Okay, this one's not as exciting as the pottery, but it's crucial. Goodbye daily lattes, hello… uh… cheaper coffee.

I'm not saying everyone should quit their jobs and become professional dog walkers (unless that's your passion, then go for it!). But maybe, just maybe, there's a way to inject more *life* into our lives, even after 45.

So, is it crazy? Maybe. Is it terrifying? Definitely. Is it worth exploring? I think so.

I'm just sharing my journey. I’m curious about those who've jumped ship, and I hope to hear some stories. Who else is rethinking the ""forever job"" thing? Anyone else out there feel the pull of something… *more*?

I don't know how to get through this because I want to get her back. How do I do that?,"We met back in college and after I graduated in 2024 I moved back to my home town about an hour away. Since then we've had some trouble because of the distance and my progress in finding a job and starting a career. She's talked to me about it before but I didn't think it was this bad. I guess I just didn't want to believe things could be over between us. 

She went out of state for a week for a conference and during that time she was not talking to me too much but I just chalked it up to her being busy but when she got back it was kind of the same but we did watch some shows together and I did go hang out with her and some friends one night. That was last week. 

3 days ago she got upset with me again because of these and told me how I promised to see her every week when I graduated. Im stupid and broke that promise.

I missed her because I wasn't able to see her cause she went out of state and because she wasn't really being too talkative with me and I knew she was upset so I went on the train to suprise her and see her. When I was on the train she texted me and said If I dont' have a job and haven't moved back to the city by January we were done so I agreed.

It was our friends birthday so I went and hung out with them but she was still upset with me. I didn't expect me visiting to fix everything but I wanted to see her in person and try to make things better. The next day I went to college with her, got us some bagels and coffee, and chilled out while she had her class and worked on campus. When she got out and we got to her car I asked if I could take her out on a dinner date because it was the anniversary of the day we met. (our relationship anniversary is also this month on the 29th). 

I brought up this dinner date idea earlier in the morning and she said no because she was still mad at me so I asked her to think about it. When I asked when we were in the car she paused and said she wants to go on a break. She doesn't want to do this anymore. She is tired of worrying about me and my future while also trying to work towards her goals.

I asked her to please not do this but she didn't change her mind. After a few minutes of talking and both of us crying we went to eat dinner. I felt a bit better and when we got to the car I asked if we could maybe reset our relationship and take it slower instead of doing a break and she said she doesn't want to do that and said she meant to say break up and not a break. This broke my heart. I know this isn't something she ever wanted to do. She loves me. She told me I will always be her best friend. It keeps ringing in my ears and makes me break out in tears every time. 

I asked if I should take the last train home and she said she can take me to the train in the morning if I want so I said okay. I think part of me hoped she would still change her mind. When we got back to her place we watched tv and she slept in my arms all night. In the morning I asked her again to change her mind, give me one last chance. She told me she's been checked out for awhile. I decided to take the next train because It wasn't fair for me to still be their and asking her to change her mind. She took me to the train station, we both were crying. The train was pulling up as we got there so I had to rush. I got my stuff and kissed her goodbye like I have hundreds of times before but this time was different.

When she broke up with me she told me she may be open to getting back together but she said I need to learn how to navigate alone and work on myself and how I can't do that while im with her.

Since I got home I've just been trying to distract myself as much as possible with gaming and youtube at the same time because any second of silence is met with my mind being filled with good memories, my mistakes, the break up. Even with those distractions I find myself blanking out and thinking of those things. She's all over my room in the form of photos, gifts, little trinkets on my desk. Every application I use has her on it, I keep seeing the shows we watch, anything reminds me of her.

I want her back and don't know what to do. The only contact we've had since I left is she sent me a streak on snapchat so I sent one back but they were both just blank screens. I don't know what to do but every day for the past 3 years I've talked to her, thought about her, and thinking of having to stop that just hurts so much. It's been so hard. I went to a bar in my town for my brothers birthday last night and her and I would go there sometimes with my family and she would show up when I worked there so seeing her favorite menu items had me sitting there holding back tears.

We have been together 2.5 years. Before leaving, I wanted to surprise her by rearranging a few items around the house to spell out something cute (we do this for each other sometimes).

On her coffee table there was a stack of notebooks, so I picked one up to use. As I lifted it, a loose sheet of paper slipped out. I glanced at it without really thinking, and realized it was a love letter from her ex, inviting her out on a date. That’s when it hit me that the notebook was probably one of her journals as she had mentioned she journals and has one of the color matching the one I picked up and that the journals are very dear to her. As soon as I realized what it was, I put it back and did not look through anything else.

Now I am sitting with this weird feeling. Maybe it is natural and not a big deal, but may it is? Especially since she keeps it in something which is apparently so important to her. She also has a box of memrobilia she keeps stuff from me and friends in, so this seems like she has gone out of her way to keep it somewhere special. Another part of me feels guilty for even having seen it. I want to emphasize that I did not open her journal or snoop intentionally, but I am worried she would be angry that I care about her personal thoughts or feel violated in her space if I brought it up. I personally have not kept anything from my ex as far as I remember, but it's also not like I made an active effort to discard it; I just feel I would not make a special effort to keep it somewhere dear to me that I look at frequently.

For context: her ex has been a point of discomfort for me before, mostly because they stayed friends after we started dating. They are not really in contact anymore. Also, we recently argued because she did not bring a gift I made for her when we moved to a new city. She said she brought most of the things I have given her but did not want to bring everything because she wanted to “start fresh” in this new place after a really tough year personally and as much as she loves it that it reminded her of our old town.

So now I am struggling with two questions: (1) is my insecurity valid? and (2) how exactly and if I should bring it up to her?

  
TL;DR: Accidentally saw an old love letter from my girlfriend’s ex fall out of one of her notebooks while I was doing something cute for her. Left me feeling weird because she seems to keep it somewhere meaningful. Now I’m not sure if my insecurity is reasonable or whether I should talk to her about it.",0,1763336632.0,relationships,5,0.33,False

So we went on our first date 10 days ago and I just got home from our second date. It felt more like a first date 2.0 with a little more closure because we needed to reconnect a little after 10 whole days (we're both 18 btw). Although we've had no problem keeping the conversation going on and on and on, I still have no idea how to initiate touch. The first time we sat to drink some coffee, and today we went to a nice tavern to eat. I just can't find a single opportunity to get a bit more intimate physically. I haven't even touched her hand but at least we hugged each other when we parted ways both times. Today I was gonna try to offer my arm during our walk till we arrived at the tavern but it was pretty apparent she wasn't really comfortable with it at that moment. However we did become closer and more familiar with each other after our talks so I think that's some progress for the next time if it happens. Am I being too hasty with physical touch or is she just the type of person to need more time first? Or maybe I'm just a dork who has no idea how to initiate it?

Sp: Yeah, right in the front. Me? I feel like... the sugar cookie creamer today. Whip cream? Extra special today I see, what's the occasion (laugh) I know, I know just teasing.
[Yawn] oh yeah still a bit tired. I was up late...uhhh. trimming the hedges, I mean bacon, no no the tree??? Yeah the tree.

Sp: the tree is artificial. Well that's why it looks so great. Not excluding your beautiful decorations of course. 
L:
Sp: Yeah, I do when I'm tired. So lets have breakfast open some gifts and take a nap and movie. We can visit everyone this afternoon.
Let's make this time just for us okay.
Hmmm
L:

[Excited puppy sounds]
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
 Surprise!?
Yeah. It's her.
(Yip yip)
What do you mean?
L:
Sp: of course I was listening. When you showed me her on the Paws and Snoots adoption insta I knew you were smitten and I figured she'd be the perfect present.
L:
Sp: Yeah, we had agreed we had the time and space for a furry friend now. So I took the next morning off and waited for them to open. And...
L:
How long have I had her? I got her Thursday. I had my mom watch her for a few days. Then she had a work emergency so I've been doing my best to keep her quiet for the last 2 days. And jeez,  puppies are a lot of work. Adorable work but still work. The amount of love and attention I had to give her so she wouldn't cry thru the night. Yawn!
L: 
Yeah  it wasn't late night bathroom runs or last minute work projects, it was me trying to keep the little one from giving everything away. Almost made it too. 
L:
Sp: Name? Well uhh, I did but just for registration. We can get it changed later. I, I named her Cookie. But if ...
L:
Sp: Perfect? Really? She reminds you of me? Adorable and sweet. 
L:
Sp: No I'm not blushing. I was just wiping sleep from my eyes.
[Kiss sfx]
Well I'm glad you're happy. Our little family of three.
L:
I love you too baby, mwah!

I suppose my obsession began then. At first, I could hide my face in between the covers and pretend the world only existed there. I didn’t have to reckon with the feelings that churned within me. I got to be invisible, to be numb.

The years passed, and my benign escapism grew into a genuine adoration of the pages I studied. I invested myself throughout school, and got what I thought was a plush job at my university’s library as an archivist. It’s not fancy, and there’s no great mysteries that we uncover, but it’s nice. It gave me warm sensation to sit deep in the belly of the library, swallowed by the records of history.

I should say that for the past six years or so, I haven’t made much effort in the way of friends. I got my comfort in organizing. I got my companionship through page and text alone. Suffice to say, though I was not disliked at work, they were my closest friends and I their off-putting and oft-forgotten coworker. I took pleasure in silence, which lulled me towards the cleaning “Hospital” rooms hidden behind the corner of two broad cherry-boarded bookshelves.

Each of our over twenty thousand books are taken out to be cleaned every three months. We inspect them for rot, dust and reshelve. Occasionally books are returned mussed- and the offender hunted down- or a dispassionate intern will spill their drink across a cart. These books are sent back to what we call the Hospital.

The Hospital is- or was, I suppose- my sanctuary. My temple. I poured all of the passion and time of my life into the books that came through there. Fixing their bindings. Regluing pages. Sanitizing their holy words, written by figures of the past and imbued with their knowledge. I was their caretaker. Their guardian. Their older sister who could patch them up after any injury they suffered.

Even now, as this precious book I write in consumes me, I cannot let it go. I cannot refuse its succor. I can only dream of falling deeper and deeper into it.

The ink swallows my eyes. Still, with some use left in my hand, I will continue this book’s story.

It came to me in the Hospital. A new piece, which any one of the professors could have dropped off- or any donor with a collection to pass along to younger generations. I remember how I saw it that first day; stuffed with a dozen other books inside a dented box alongside several others of its kin. It was not singular to the objective eye, but I had a penchant for searching these dusty tomes for the most disused of their batch. Though they were all similarly bound, the allure of this book was binding in its gaze. As soon as my eyes laid upon it, I knew it would be the target of my focus.

The traces of cobweb had been wiped away, but still the dust and lingering silk across the massed tomes seemed to originate and spread from this one book like a sprinkled trail. Its spine and cover were layered in dust, and if once there was a title upon it, I have never found one.

It was like seeing the most beautiful diamond in the world deep amongst coal. I knew it was special from the small glance out of the corner of my eye, which turned into rapt inspection of the new arrivals, and then reverent exhumation of the book from its mass grave.

I signed the paperwork for transfer, and the unwanted gems were mine to care for. I set upon them voraciously. There is a whole ritual around cleaning a new arrival for the first time. I took this book from its brethren and laid it upon my Surgeon’s table. Gloved, with a pale grey jacket akin to that of a doctor, I reverently began to brush away the years of dust and detritus that were caked onto the cover. As the layers were peeled away, a dark brown cover, like that of the strongest coffee or the deepest earth, was revealed. It was warm, in many senses. Like the way the bricks of a fireplace show warmth, even when a fire has not been lit in a long time. An ashen warmth, that pulls you in from the stark white cold and gives you comfort in the deepness of its color.

It was leather. Of what kind, I’m not sure, but it was poorly taken care of and the binding creaked and showed little lines of cracking while I bent the poor thing. The pages were rustic, but smooth. It is my process to clean the exterior entirely before opening up the book, and in cleaning the open edges of the pages I saw that only about half of the book showed signs of use. There were oil marks about two-thirds down the longest side of the book where one’s fingers might rest, and signs of wear at the top corner which I chastised its former owner over in my head.

When my exterior inspection and general dusting was complete, I set the book upon a fresh blanket of surgery sheet paper and- with much care so as to not harm it one bit- I opened the cover.

There was no title page. No introduction, or table of contents. Not even big bold typeface declaring ‘Journal’ as I had suspected with its half-used papers. I know now why no word could be used to describe this thing. A journal is what you wish to write down. What you wish to remember. A history is the reality that the world experienced. A record is one’s account of that experience. A novel is fiction, and none of it as honest as what I found these words to be. I opened this book and found none of those things, but in it I have found a truer history than any record or collection of written experience could share.

A wall off text greeted me upon the first page. Scrawled by hand with ink and archaic pen. The style was bold and angular, the strokes given with such a strong hand that I was surprised they had not broken through the thin paper. I remember reading that first line as I slowly traced a cloth across the dusty page. It was written in Middle English, which I could parse thankfully well due to a former professor’s obsession with the time period.

*“Whan hertis growen cold and here oyle hath dried, ancestres embraacen here soules and shun the onys that lied.”*

The rest of the page contained similar musings and proverbs, but written as prose as if an overzealous teacher was declaring their brilliance through lecture. The writer spoke of ancestors guarding the gates to your mind; that if you cannot reconcile with them, they disavow you of being yourself. This caught onto my brain like a tempting lure to a fish. I do not expect everyone to feel as I do when archaic prose by an unknown hand falls before them, but perhaps I log this in the right place. Perhaps if you’ve read the book this far, you know some of what I mean when I say that it sparked a hunger in me.

The entry lasted three pages in total. There were hardly any line breaks, and it was straight communication from author to reader, like I said it felt akin to a lecture’s transcription. There was no date, but at the end of the final page a single letter was scrawled for a signature. Elegant calligraphy, done by the same pen was the Elder Futhark rune Kenaz – or Kaun ( < ). Likely an initial, or shorthand of some kind, I found it odd that the author had not deviated from the alphabet or language once save for the rune.

Picking up immediately on the page following was another entry, by another hand.

As I cleaned, the second author’s voice came to me clearly from their words; frantic, beseeching, pleading through the pages. If you could not read the warning when you began this book, I hope this translation might help. It won’t, I know that in my heart. If you’ve read this far, you’re already dead.

*(In Middle English)*

*“The pages consume.*

*They were empty before, and \[they\] have taken his voice and stolen it. They stole his mind a week later. His eyes have gone, and all that remains is this record.*

*Do not write in this book. I read what has been written, and must continue it. In a short while my voice shall only be heard inside these covers. My memory will only be this ink.*

*Do not read this book.*

*Do not write in this book.*

*I would pray to God for my salvation, but I feel the warmth of Hell on my neck already. There was no saving Adam once he ate the Fruit. This book is Babel. This book is sin.*

*Do not read this book.”*

I do not have to explain to you, reader, that I did not heed this warning. You meet me here, in my own chapter, and know that I ate the Fruit of Satan. Knowledge is so inviting, and though there was no snake to tempt me, I have bitten it of my own accord.

I do wish I could say that I acted for my duties rather than my interest. But I turned the next page because I was curious, and because I had a hunger for answers that would not be satisfied by this century-old hand. My logical brain was on layaway, a fact I became aware of when I realized I had wrapped the book gently and placed it in my bag when I went home that night.

I never went to work the next day. Surprise, surprise, I have cleaning equipment and gloves at home. I set up my triage tent moments after dinner, which settled into my stomach forgetfully, and went straight to the next section of my meticulous purpose.

I was about twenty pages in- where it switches to the first author who writes in French- and was trying to recall my lessons. This was certainly very ancient French, which like Old and Middle English is occasionally unrecognizable to modern dialects. The author was not making much sense, and even with a notepad alongside, I could not translate much. Best I can gather, he was a monk at the Jumièges Abbey in Normandy. Whether it was in the original or the reconstituted Abbey built by William the Conqueror, I’m not certain. I would wager that it would be the rebuilt, however, based on the Middle English writings before it. A linguist might parse more information from his dialogue, but he makes no reference to year or date. I could take the time to revisit his entry with my new lucidity… but my time is short. Better to write, before the rot surpasses my ability.

The monk raves about spiritual possession for several pages. From what I could translate, most is inane and I found no use for it. Another task for another caretaker, I think.

*“It took Brother Stephen by the eyes and God, I know it now too. A black worm slides across my pupil, undulating as it pulls me deeper. It craves me. The devil cannot hide from God. The devil uses God to hide from us. Knowledge is Human temptation. We are animals without it, but the Blessing of God is not to be sought on our own. Brother Ragnov has locked me in the crypt, for he knows the curse I bear is not to be fought but ignored. I killed Brother Stephen. I have said it in confession and I lay my sins bare for God and Lucifer alike to read here. A good priest I am not, but a good friend I surely have been. It is no sin to be murdered, and there can be no greater sin than this. I take Brother Stephen’s place, and offer myself as sacrifice. Brother Stephen whispered his thanks in the damp cellar where he fell, and this book then came to my bloody hands and weeping eyes.”*

This was the most coherent of his ramblings, and the most damning. I cannot help but know I join the ranks of many, whose stories are now claimed by this book. How many eyes have been locked upon these delicate pages? How many hands have brushed their skin? How many lives are locked inside? They are reverent, they are abhorred. In church they used to say that the people who saw angels were terrified. I am not a spiritual person. But I do wonder; when we meet spirits that are stronger and greater than us, can we tell whether they are good or evil? Can we ever truly know?

It was upon reading this monk’s testimony that I had my first urge to put down the book. I did not fancy the feeling of sins laid bare, nor this ravenous urge I had to consume its contents more and more. It had always been within me, that urge to know what came on the next page. I have never been afraid of death, as it is a history unwritten, and one I know waits for me with bated breath. I do not fear death even as I write, because there is beauty in an empty page. You are likely familiar with Schrödinger's box and its supposed feline inhabitant. You can never truly, 100% be certain whether the cat is in the box or not until you open it. Well, death to me is akin to this; it will be a subversion. Because you do not know what will come, any expectation is not whole. Therefore, when you die- or when you throw back the box’s lid- no matter what you find, it cannot be what you fully expected. So, I should not be surprised that death, for me, is placing my memory on these pages.

I might add that while I continued reading, I never stopped my duty of caretaking this book. I have turned from Surgeon to Mortician to Gravekeeper, and I have taken more reverence with its reconstitution than any book I have ever held. I could see the truth of its accounts even then. The pure honesty within these pages should not be hidden and buried; they should be displayed. How beautiful to have this record, I thought as I was urged to turn past the monk’s words. How wonderful to know these people so well. I did not yet know that the time would come for them to know me as deeply.

But I know that the burden of my memories does not have to be upon my shoulders any longer. I can place them here on the shelf, and the book will carry them for me.

I know the worm of which he spoke, too. When you are very tired, or sometimes when struck by bright lights, there are little worm-trails which might trace across your vision and the back of your eyelids. Picture a cousin of theirs, black and oily. Its skin is barbed like a cat’s tongue and scrapes your eyes. It has no legs, but wriggles and squirms across my eye when I look up from the book. A creature of ink, which I feel gnaw at the sides of my skull when I stand up or walk around. It nibbles and bites my skin, but waits to feast. I will not need this body soon. Once my story is done, the body will be nothing but nutrients, and my inky friend may have what he so clearly needs.

I saw the worm first after my second break from this book. While the monk’s words jarred me, and reminded me of my own sins, I was soon lost in the translations again. There were several other entries in French; I gather that this book was passed from Monastery to Monastery, each as clueless and damned as the others as to how to halt its collection of knowledge. Then, I came upon a very odd discovery that I had not noticed thus far.

Buried too deep within the book to be at all reasonable, a single, water-logged page was thinly connected and bound with the others. No writing was upon it, and its neighbors even seemed hydrophobic. All the moisture of this page slid off of the others, and it dripped heavily. It did not tear as I turned it, nor did the towel which I attempted to dry it with absorb a single drop. I rose to fetch a camera, so that I could record this odd interaction, and for the first time I realized it was late afternoon. I had stayed up overnight, and missed my entire day at work while pouring over this book.

The worm came upon me then, scratching at the corner of my eye with its round form. I could not brush it away nor halt it, and it kissed along my eyeball with its spongy mouth. I knew from the instant I felt it that it was ushering for me to keep reading. It tickled my ear with tendrils I could not see, and I forgot all about my desire to record the wet page. I went back to the book.

My heart fell some when I looked upon the page following the wetness and found it written in some Norse tongue. Icelandic, or Norwegian? I had never studied it, and by all rights it should have been useless to me, but as my eyes fell upon the words, it was like the worm whispered to me their meaning.

*“Captain Oda has lost his mind,”* it read in thin charcoal. *“He raves for the hunt like a barbarian. He hungers for the whales like an animal. If God blessed him against them at some point, surely the waves have swallowed that blessing and spat him out once more. Surely Jonah was his grandfather, the way he hates the creatures.*

*I take shore leave in Dublin, and I think I shall disappear before he returns again. No good has come of travelling with that man. A broken ship is an ill omen. To find three crushed upon the same ice… Any wise sailor would not take that path again.*

*Oda hunts for the whales, ever vigorous, and I believe he will see the same bitter end. Leeched, by his career. Burned by his fire.*

*This book, the silver earrings, and my share of coin from the wreckage will keep me fine company while I find a shepherd’s daughter and a good hill to grow old on.”*

I felt as if I could see this man, with a coarse black beard and patch, seablown hair, getting into an argument with Captain Oda. White-haired and foaming, the Captain was as stark a whaler as Ahab, and though he stood on two strong legs, the hatred and madness in his eyes were fiercely reminiscent of the emphatic Captain of Melville’s. He called the man- whose name I learned to be Armann- craven, and drove his calloused fist into the table, shaking the wooden hull.

It was not that Armann’s writing was so eloquent and vivid, but my senses were being taken by the book. I was experiencing that argument, and the author’s escape to shore. The worm had covered both of my eyes fully, and all I could see was Memory. Armann took his coin and his book inland, wandering for some weeks, and settled on the southern end of Ireland. I read his writing, the only thing in the old world of my life which I could still see, and saw him fall in love, get married, and raise a small family with a lovely woman. But he kept this book, and every year or two he was pulled back to it. He admits to reading it, over and over, and wondering how the next pages could go.

I watched as his entries led to ramblings, hunched over his table with cheap ink and quill in the dark hours of the night. He bemoaned of an infestation in his grain, a rot in his heart and a longing for the sea.

*“I hear its rhythmic murmur, that ode to my former life which kisses my neck as I turn. The tongue of sin entices me, and I feel the hungering for my mistress waves every day.*

*She wants me. She has longed for me so. I do not know how much I can resist. Duty has been chosen, but we all fall to our true selves at some point.”*

I had reached this point at the end of the second night of my ravenous duties with the book, and though its lure still pulled me inward, my body was exhausted and I could not keep myself upright any further. I didn’t even consider leaving the book on my desk, or sealing it away again. No, my treasure slept beside me atop the covers. My hand rested upon its rejuvenated binding, and I felt its warmth all night.

I dreamt the dreams of Armann, and those of Brother Peter and a dozen other authors; those I knew from their uncovered writings, and those I did not recognize yet. Each moment was baked in reality; a thin sliver of memory that the pages held on to.  I fell through them like shattered glass, living each life just for a moment until their sentence ended and another face was thrust upon me. There was no unity to it, but a cacophony of wild and senseless moments that rarely lasted longer than a handful of seconds. I knew in my dream what this book does to people, and their lives.

It stores them, yes. It is a beautiful record. But it turns our lives to mulch. Splintered, disparate, and wandering for eternity. It chops our sins like a butcher and turns them to compost. Whether we are fuel, sustenance, or entertainment for the book is unclear to me still. Perhaps it has no will. Perhaps it just has purpose. I cannot blame it for that. I don’t think I can blame it for anything. So far, at least, it has been quite beautiful to be consumed. It’s like becoming a part of history.

You have likely read the ending of Armann Agnesson’s account, as I did the following morning, but I wonder if you, too, watched it happen in your dreams before you read it? I saw the veins popping in his arms, wriggling like worms as his family struggled. He was a broad man, Armann. Strong-shouldered from decades of ship work and hard labor. But he had never seemed violent- even across many disagreements with Oda, he had never lashed out at his longtime friend. And, while no memory could truly justify such an immoral crime, I cannot help but wonder what the moments leading up to his final snap had been. He did not weep for his wife or his daughters in the notes afterward, only begging for comfort from the book as he fled his homestead to the sea.

I dreamed of another scene, one that was not written or mentioned by Agnesson. I saw him standing upon a great cliff of dark grass, which blew with his hair in the damp wind of the Atlantic. I saw through his own eyes Armann holding this book- my book- and reading it through one last time. He placed it upon the rocks, and walked towards the cliff’s ledge. Without as much as a pause or a moment of reverence, he flung himself from the cliff and plunged towards the cove below.

I fell with him, and struck the water. Air released as ribs broke and the Norseman’s organs collapsed. His eyes were wide open, somehow, and I saw the dark worms which nibble at my own vision creep upon him from the waters. They moved like sea snakes, effortlessly rolling upon his shattered body and grasping it with their tiny feelers and curious mouths. They grabbed Armann by the legs and pulled him deeper, deeper, until darkness ate him, and fed him to her children.

In this mottled shared memory, I think he was happy to be consumed by the waves. When you give so much of your life to something, it feels natural to die to it as well.

I brought my cleaning equipment to my room. Whether or not my body would remain once my story was complete, I wanted to die in here. I don’t deserve bodily comfort, but again, I am a sinner, so you should expect me to be a little selfish.

I think the book must have traded hands that did not use it for some time after Armann, because the next entry gave us our first date of all the authors, and it has travelled quite a distance. He writes in educated Arabic, which I thankfully know from my father’s side, and common Spanish interchangeably. The language no longer held barriers for me, and I actually have to wonder how much of either language I knew before reading this book. I could never speak Arabic fluently, and though I am an adept reader, I never spent much time on my other languages. Now I read them perfectly, though the ink does not morph it to a language I know, I understand that the book has touched my mind. I have worked the translations on other pages, so a record remains outside of the book. Perhaps it is unnecessary to put them here, but I have learned enough in school to be as thorough as I can.  

""23 *August, 1348. University of al-Qarawiyyin. Fez, Morocco.*

*“They tried to take you from me. Your words of wisdom and history fall upon conservative and frightful ears. I could not let them have you. I found you, preserved you, gardened you back to life like a beautiful flower which wilted through fall. I could not let them destroy you. We must go. I do not grieve for those I struck down; if they could not hear God’s voice in you then they were surely of Iblis.*

*“If I could read the old words of God, it would at least be a comfort as Shaitan’s forces come to wrest this new scripture from me. I hear only the wailing of students outside, who have discovered their kindred slain. I must go, I think, before my legs cannot carry God’s word to safety. I can feel the weight of it… the incorrigible depression of will which tries to bind me.*

*“There is darkness in this book, as there is darkness in us all. But God speaks only truth, even if that truth is harsh and cruel.”*

He took the book to Spain, where he had family, and stayed for a month before travelling further north and east, making small notations of his distance along the way. His final entry is from Bucharest, nearly two years after the original. I will note that this would place him at the beginning of Bucharest’s rise in the region, nearly a hundred years before it became capital of Wallachia- and then Romania.

“12 June, 1350. Bucharest, Wallachia.

*“I have found members of intermingling faiths who can come upon the same agreements as I. This book is Holy, though we might disagree on our Prophets, it is indisputable to us that its hunger for memory is God’s capsule. We have all read its contents, and dreamed the beauty of its collection. I wish only that more hands had held it before mine.*

*“A Christian church is being built here, and I know my options dwindle as my body no longer allows for further travel. I entrust it to my circle of friends, one being the priest dedicated to the new church, who will seal it as a relic and ensures me that our Faithful will keep watch upon these words.*

*“My name is Ontanon Bashir. I have attempted to serve God and follow the words of His Prophet, Peace Be Upon Him. I pray for truth in my actions, that my faith has been as sure as my actions are irreversible. I pray for this book, and those who may read its Blessed word.”*

There was a single page of notes from other members of this circle- and the priest who hid the book in his new church, but the next entry I find significant came a hundred years after. The lineage of priests and members of what they call the “Tomekeepers” is well-documented in those sections, but during the Ottoman and Wallachian disputes, there seemed to be several bickering members who could not decide what to do.

*“1456, Bucharest. Brother Mikail.*

*“The Dragon descends upon us. He will kill us all to steal the memory of God. The Tome must be removed. Brother Andres agrees, and the two of us will smuggle it out before the Dragon can claim it. I do not know what he could do with such a thing, but its morality is questioned by our circle already. It would do no good in our prince’s hands. We saw as much in his youth when he visited our church, before his indentured absence at the Sultan’s will.”*

If you are unfamiliar with Hungarian as a language, you might find the draconic imagery… fanciful. But know I have tried to be as accurate as possible in translation, and that Vlad the Impaler chose his epithet- even signing his name as a word that means both *“Dragon”* and *“Devil”* in Hungarian. *Drakulya*.

How Prince Vlad learned of this book is not clear, but from the conversations I have seen of the Tomekeepers, they had full belief that his return to capture Wallachia was fueled by his passion to take this book. Due to the priest’s last line, I suspect that Vlad was allowed access to the book; the Tomekeepers’ were localized in Bucharest, and it’s likely that some of them were high-ranking in the courts there. Perhaps they wanted him to join their ranks, in his youth, and were thwarted when Vlad II, his father, was forced to send two sons to the Ottoman Empire as hostages. I can imagine Prince Vlad longing for the book, as he was Sultan Mehmed’s ward. There were sins that formed him into a sinner. He turned mad without the book to share them with, and I wonder how much of his legend could have been avoided if the book had been allowed to swallow his sin.

Two Brothers of this church escaped the Impaler’s siege and it passed through a cluster of French and then English churches, never without a loyal protector and caretaker. It is like the book knows people would destroy it. We destroy all that we don’t understand. We hate art that was not made for us. We resent that which we cannot have. I have resented life for quite a long time now. Odd, that though my senses and emotions fade, I can manage to feel some remorse over that.

I had poured over this book for several hundred years of its memory by now, but Dracula’s appearance, and the reminder of his mythological hunger peeled back the curtain over my senses for a moment, and I was once again aware of my physical existence.

The worms had eaten most of the flesh off of my face already. Whether it was still the second day, or whether a hundred moons had passed, it was impossible to tell and irrelevant. I could feel the slow air of my humid room brush alongside my exposed gums and teeth. My eyes, though the lids opened, could not see. The worms had rotted them, and I felt an ooze around their cavity that I dared not touch closer. My hands bled at the nail beds, though no drops have wounded the book. I tasted bile and smelled of sulfur, and nearly passed out as I inhaled for what was likely the first time in days.

In my ear, I heard my own heartbeat. Thick, as if I held my hand up to my ear, and arhythmic. It did not feel like a failing heart, but one that defied the metronome of time. It was scattered and weary; though the sound pooled around my head like bloody water, it had no structure and was loose upon the wind.

I tried to fix myself- in some animalistic, natural reaction to the stench of death, I tried to remove it. I scrambled about my room, searching for the dresser and my handgun within. There was some trouble with the lock upon my safe, but I managed to click it open and retrieve the cold gun. I then held it in my hand and faced a conflict. I write, of course, from the other side of that conflict. In which, to the worm’s whispered approval, I did not pull the trigger.

I was not stopped. I was not saved. I chose another way. Life is brutal, and brutalism should be remembered. There is beauty in its honesty, and beauty in the truth of horror. I have struggled with the memory of my sister, and I know why this book has come to me. It wants my pain. It wants to know the feeling of it, to share it. It chomps and chews at us, keeping those horrible memories as the most beautiful and brutal of all.

The entries continue throughout the 15^(th) and 16^(th) centuries, following the Tomekeeper order as they rebuilt and experimented with the occult in England. In 1649, at the trial and execution of King Charles I, a Royalist Tomekeeper by the name of Jean-Pierre Thibodeaux smuggled it back to his mother country of France, where he kept it in “unmarred condition.” It was the only thing to cross his path unmarred, it would seem.

I have no desire to comment on Thibodeaux ’s proclivities. I had no joy in reading them, and I fought back disgust when I saw through the pages the words of several dozen frightened people. He was a serial killer, by modern accounts. He traveled between villages, claiming innocents along the way. There had been a large dissolution of the Faithful amongst the Tomekeepers in their three hundred years of existence. Thibodeaux used the book to further his sin, though his reasoning why I cannot imagine. Greed of that nature just doesn’t come to me, I suppose.

He made them read the book. He made them stare at the ink until the foreign words made sense, and their minds broke, and then he made them write their wretched, painful stories.

*“It is the cleanest of kills,”* he wrote after one victim’s statement. “*There is no blood. There is no pain. There is only the memory, and the joy of it.”*

I’m unsure if Thibodeaux was consumed by the book itself, like Armann and Ontanon, but his entries stopped after what I make to be his twenty-third kill. A holy number, unfortunately.

There is only one entry that spans the nearly 400 years between Jean-Pierre Thibodeaux and my own. Where the book traveled in the intervening time is impossible to know, but I desire to learn with my whole heart those mysteries. The bloody trail these pages have left cannot be abandoned once you have found it. The only path is forward. The only route is down.

My direct predecessor, it would seem, was a French soldier. I place it around 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War.

*“I found this book in a company of dead men.*

*“General Douay’s division was destroyed, and we have been routed from Wissembourg. I cannot explain why, in the hunkered fleeing of souls afraid of mortal peril, I stopped for a book. I have no need to read. Death waits for me. Prussian dogs chase us back, and here I spend the few hours I should rest buried within this book.*

*“It knows me. It hurts to have it know what I have done, the lives I have ended. The sons I have killed. They whisper in my ear to join them, but out of cowardice I flee.*

*“I do not read regret in the voices of this book.*

*“They warn, and protect the veil over it. But they are standing on the other line of Redemption. They have shed their sins.*

*“I, too, want to be saved.”*

I know I have sinned. You don’t have to believe in God to know you have done wrong, and to bear that guilt inside. Some people forget it through drugs or alcohol or by abuse. I tried to forget it through work. Through books. Ironic that I am placing my guilt here for eternity now.

I shall add my story to the rest. My surgery has been successful. I just have to put the next words in, and the book will find its next reader.

*\[page break\]*

My name is Melanie Tuttman. I was born April 12, 1992 in Hoboken, New Jersey, USA. This book has been travelling to me since before I was born, but I have been doing the work to deserve it since I was twelve.

2004 was a harsh winter in Hoboken. Most are, but I remember my mother shoving more layers than an onion onto my sister and I before we bounced out into the heavy snow to play. The streets were icy, but that never deterred us before. Three years my elder, Grace and I were just beginning to reach that point where siblings become enemies. There were countless frivolous arguments we had; on this day it had been over who got to wear the yellow beanie. We didn’t favor one color over another, but if one was handed over by our mom first, that became the object of our desire. Mom had settled us into our cocooned coats and put the hats on us herself, telling us to share and stop fighting over it.

That fixed the argument about as well as you can imagine. I walked out of our door with yellow crochet upon my head and my sister’s eyes glaring at my back. It was merely minutes before Grace, from out of my sight, lobbed a wadded ball of snow straight towards my head. It struck home, scattering the snow across me as I yelped and yelled at her. I saw her uphill from me, on the long street that stretches up the incline of our neighborhood. I ran for her, gathering snow as I did. She threw more snowballs at me as I ran, and one caught me in the face.

I don’t think she knew it had ice in it. She was shocked at the spackled blood across my cheek, and the way it made me stumble in my step as I ran up to her. She stepped in to catch me, like a good big sister should, and I shoved her away.

Grace lost her footing in the snow when I shoved her; she did not catch herself. I was mad that she hurt me, and yes, I had wanted to hurt her in kind. I wanted her to fall on her ass and feel the pain I felt.

Remember with me how my sister’s skull cracked. Too easily for a whole life to be shattered. Like an egg over the skillet, the uncaring hands of fate swiftly crumpling the plates of bone as they struck the icy street.  My sister slid as she died. Down the steep hill, the dirty snow of the street slick and wet, only speeding her descent down the impossibly long throat that intimidated me into a panic as I fled after her. Her blood joined the white and slurred snow, quickly turning the street into a wide red tongue behind her. She did not stop until her poor, immobilized body struck the front wheel of a parked car and brought her slide to a violent and abrupt end.

I could have avoided this consumption. I could have taken a different path. It was not the angry lashing out of a teenage girl that damned me to this book. It was how I let my mother hold me when she found us. It was how I told her it was all an accident; Grace had slipped on her own, and the blood on my forehead was from tripping as I ran after her.

I practiced my sin every day, when I let people grieve with and comfort me. “A tragic accident” they would say. “How horrible for you to have seen it.” And I would smile sadly and nod my head, thanking them. Everyone understood that I had to grieve, too. They didn’t know the truth. They didn’t know the saddest part of all, but I was reminded of it every time someone brought up the false story I had told.

Grace died thinking I hated her. Grace died thinking that I wanted to hurt her. And in those moments, I had.

For decades now I have dodged the truth of my life. The cowardice of it. I have buried myself away from people, so that I might rot in isolation as I know I deserve. I have hidden myself in the covers of history so that I could forget my own.

I have lived too long now, and bypassed all opportunities to unshoulder my sin other than here. When my parents pass, they will join Grace in… I suppose I’m not sure where. I know I shall not be there, though, and they can speak of true things in my absence.

My body rots now, in my old bed. I think I shall hold this book until I am gone. How many weeks have come and gone whilst the book takes my story? I cannot cease my curiosity even now. I shall speak, a bit, to what I understand has happened to me physically. Perhaps it might help another reader, should another fortunate sinner be found.

When I began writing, my eyesight had been swallowed. I could see only the worms, myself, and the writing. I think the black worms which appear to the elucidated consciousness are spectral manifestations of the book’s fingers or feelers or whatever limb might bring forward in to its mouth, so to speak. They are ethereal, as I remember trying to wipe them away and they could not be pushed. And yet I feel them- or felt them as I was taken. They crawled upon me and licked me like a fly upon a sweaty neck. They ate my eyeballs as I wrote, and I had no reason to pause. I had nothing left to experience. I have nothing left to see.

They ate my tongue, after chewing through my cheeks. I had no other words to speak but what I write here. My hearing went soon, with them squirming and compressing and squeezing their little bodies in my ears to deafen me. They chewed and ate the cartilage, and severed the eardrum apart so I could no longer hear their working. This was a damning one, for as I wrote of Bashir’s holy exodus, I lost all sense of the world I once inhabited. My sense of smell went, so I cannot know the true level of rot in which I sit. It could have been five days since I began. It could have been a thousand. Time does not matter here, in these pages. Your memory is forever, like your sin.

The last feeling of my bones is that they are loose and failing. My wrist feels like rubber, and my fingers are sticky and thin. In my educated analysis, over many years of writing and knowing what the pen feels like in my hand, my fingertips must be gone. I think I can feel the pen pressed against bone, for it is wiggly and uncertain on occasion. I apologize, then, for any failings of my script. Hopefully, reader, you can parse through it with the gifts from our assimilating worms.

Know that it is a delight to be remembered. Know that it is an honor to be remembered honestly.

Remember that the sins you keep to yourself can never be forgiven by another. Remember that truth, regardless of how brutal, is the only way to avoid damning yourself.

No force has come to steal this book from me, or try to burn it or worship it or hide it away like a relic. Perhaps it has been forgotten, in the centuries it has been lost. I know its power, its voracious hunger. It is an intimidating thing. But an evil thing? No, it is an honest thing.

It is your turn now. Do not be afraid of the book. Do not try to resist its worms.

Write your honesty, and know you will be remembered with truth.

I weigh 18g of coffee grinds and the espresso weighs roughly 36g and by itself I think the espresso taste fine but after pouring milk it’s like you can’t even taste the coffee anymore.

1oz0p9a,https://i.redd.it/vkf0eq0bdp1g1.jpeg,Question,"Over the past couple of months or so I have posted a few pinhole images, which I am calling ""kaleidoscopes"" (see my earlier posts). I used a coffee can and made seven pinholes - 6 in a hexagon pattern, and one in the center. For those the pinholes were pretty close together - maybe 1 cm - maybe less?

I wanted to try this out again, but have the pinholes further apart - just to see what would be the result. So I just made a new camera from a coffee can, but the pinholes are 3cm apart this time. Pic of this is in this post.

So my question now is - what can I use for a ""shutter""? For my other coffee cans (I have another with just one pinhole) I just cover the whole with tape - and remove the tape for the exposure. Given that the distance between the farthest pinholes is 6cm, I don't think trying to use tape will work - way too cumbersome to remove and put back on.

Any suggestions?

1oz0o06,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oz0o06/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_in_alaska_the/,I'm a Search and Rescue Officer in Alaska. The Radios Always Click at 03:07. Part 1,"The thing about working Search and Rescue above the Arctic Circle is that you get comfortable with silence. Not the absence of sound, there's always wind, always the groan of ice settling, always your own breath fogging in the headlamp beam. I mean the silence of empty space. Miles of it. The kind that makes you understand why the Iñupiat have forty-seven words for different types of darkness.

I'm on my fourth year at the Utqiaġvik SAR station. Tonight's a paperwork shift, which means I'm alone in the operations room with three thermoses of coffee and a stack of incident reports that need signatures. The heater clicks on every twelve minutes. The radios hiss their white noise lullaby. Outside, it's -34°F and the tundra stretches flat and featureless to the horizon like a frozen ocean.

Most people who go missing out here fall into three categories: tourists who underestimate the cold, locals who overestimate their sobriety, and elders who simply walk into the white and don't come back. That last category we don't talk about much. It's cultural. It's complicated. It's not my story to tell.

What I can tell you is this: the radios always click at 03:07.

Not a transmission. Not interference. Just a single, sharp click across all five channels simultaneously. Atmospheric pressure, I told myself for the first two years. Electromagnetic phenomenon. The aurora does strange things to signals up here.

Then last night, I checked the station log going back eleven years.

Every night. 03:07 exactly. Every single night for over four thousand consecutive days.

That's not atmospheric. That's accounting.

And last night, after the click, I heard something else. A sound like papers shuffling. Like someone flipping through a ledger, running their finger down a column of names.

Last night, I heard them stop on mine.


___


The call came in at 02:47.

I was still staring at the logbook, pen frozen in my hand, when the emergency line lit up. A voice I recognized, Thomas Aqpik, a whaling captain from Browerville speaking fast in a mix of English and Iñupiaq.

His daughter. Eight years old. Nika. She'd taken the dog sled out to check the nets despite being told to wait until morning. The lead dog came back alone an hour ago, still in harness, trailing cut traces.

I was geared up and on my snowmobile in six minutes.

Before I cleared the gate, Auntie intercepted me.

That's what everyone calls her, Auntie. She's not my aunt. She's not anyone's aunt specifically, but she's everyone's Auntie in the way that matters. Seventy-something, worked SAR before there was a formal SAR, knows the ice like she knows her own kitchen. She does dispatch now, mostly, and watches over the younger officers with the intensity of someone who's already buried too many of us.

She stood in front of my snowmobile with one hand raised.

""You know the rules, Benjamin.""

I did. Everyone who works out here learns them in the first week, usually delivered as graveyard-shift folklore by veterans with frostbite scars and thousand-yard stares.

Rule One: Don't go out between 3:00 and 3:14 AM unless it's life or death.

Rule Two: If you see figures in the distance that don't move like animals or people, don't acknowledge them. Don't look directly at them. Don't call out. They're called Walkers, and they're always there, you just can't usually see them.

I nodded. ""It's 02:49. I'll have her back before three.""

Auntie's expression didn't change. She reached into her parka and pulled out a small pouch, seal leather, stitched with sinew, the kind elders keep their most important things in.

""You know the first two rules,"" she said. ""Here's the one they don't tell you until you need it.""

She pressed the pouch into my gloved hand. Inside was something hard and angular. Felt like a piece of carved bone.

""If you see yourself ahead of you on the trail,"" she said, voice dropping to something barely audible over my idling engine, ""do not catch up. Do not call to it. Do not try to overtake it. That one's already paid.""

The cold suddenly felt colder.

""Paid to who?""

She stepped back from the snowmobile. ""The tundra keeps books, Benjamin. The Walkers keep the ledger. Find the girl. Bring her home. But remember, debts don't disappear. They only transfer.""

I didn't fully understand. I didn't have time to ask.

I opened the throttle and drove into the dark.

I found Nika at 03:09.

By then I'd already violated Rule One. The search grid had taken longer than expected—, visibility was maybe fifteen feet in the ground blizzard, and I'd had to dismount three times to check tracks. When I finally spotted the shape in my headlamp, small and dark against the snow, I felt a surge of relief so intense it was almost painful.

She was curled inside a frost heave, a perfect square of uplifted ice, about four feet on each side, edges geometrically sharp in a way that natural ice never forms. She wasn't shivering. Wasn't crying. Just sitting there with her knees drawn up, head down, like she was waiting for a bus.

""Nika!"" I called, killing the engine and running toward her. ""Nika, honey, it's Ben from SAR. Your dad sent me. Are you hurt?""

She didn't respond.

I knelt beside her, pulling off my glove to check her face for frostbite. Her skin was cold but not frozen. Pupils reactive. Breathing steady. She looked up at me with an expression I've never quite been able to describe. Not fear. Not relief. Something closer to resignation.

""They said you'd come,"" she whispered.

""Who said?""

That's when I made the mistake.

I turned my headlamp to check behind her, to see if there was someone else, maybe a older sibling or a lost hiker who'd been sheltering with her.

The beam swept across the figure standing directly behind her.

Tall, maybe eight feet. Impossibly thin. Black against the sky but somehow darker, like it was absorbing the light rather than reflecting it. No face. No features. Just a silhouette that held itself in perfect stillness.

Except for its right arm.

Its right arm was slightly outstretched, angled down, exactly mirroring my own posture as I held the flashlight.

I froze.

The Walker—, remained motionless for three seconds. Four. Five.

Then it tilted its head.

Not like an animal cocks its ear to listen. Like someone examining an interesting specimen. The gesture was perfectly calibrated, measured, almost curious. It was the exact head-tilt I do when I'm assessing an injured hiker's mobility.

It was *my* gesture.

I heard my own voice in my head, screaming the rules. *Don't acknowledge them. Don't look directly at them.*

Too late. I was staring right into the void where its face should be.

The Walker held my gaze for another impossible moment.

Then it simply wasn't there. No fade, no movement. Between one heartbeat and the next, the space behind Nika was empty.

I grabbed the girl, pulled her onto my back, and ran for the snowmobile.

I don't remember the ride back. I remember Nika's small arms around my neck. I remember my speedometer pinned at 47 mph across terrain I normally take at 15. I remember the station lights appearing in the distance like a miracle.

I remember checking my watch as we crossed the gate.

03:13.

Nika was fine. Mild exposure, no frostbite, no injuries. Dehydrated but alert. The clinic kept her for observation and she was released to her parents that morning with a clean bill of health.

I was a hero. Thomas Aqpik shook my hand so hard I thought he'd dislocate my shoulder. The station chief wrote me up for a commendation. Someone brought donuts.

Auntie pulled me into the supply room and closed the door.

""You looked at it.""

It wasn't a question.

I nodded.

She closed her eyes for a long moment. When she opened them, they were wet.

""You saved the girl,"" she said quietly. ""That's good. That's what you should have done. But you need to understand what happens now.""

She sat down heavily on a crate of emergency flares.

""The Walkers—they're not ghosts. They're not demons. They're...auditors. The tundra takes people, Benjamin. That's just what it does. Has for hundreds years. But there are rules. Balance. When someone goes missing, their name goes in the ledger. The Walkers come to collect.""

""Collect what?""

""The debt. The space they took up. The warmth they borrowed from the world. My grandmother tried to explain it once. The words don't translate right."" She rubbed her face. ""Point is—Nika's name was in that ledger. You found her alive. You brought her back.""

""So the debt is closed. That's good.""

""No."" Her voice was flat. ""The debt doesn't disappear. You looked directly at a Walker. You acknowledged it. By doing that, you accepted the transfer. Someone still has to pay. The ledger needs a name.""

My stomach dropped.

""Now it's yours.""

She stood up, pulled me to my feet, looked me hard in the eyes.

""You have seven shifts. When the clock hits 03:07, seven nights from now, the Walkers come for you. Unless you balance the ledger another way.""

""What way?""

""A missing person call will come in. You find them. Alive. And then you… transfer the debt. The case closes clean, your slate is wiped, and you walk away a free man.""

A cold void opened in my stomach. ""That can't be true.""

""It is. Your name leaves the book. Another one takes its place.""

The horror of it locked my jaw. When I could finally speak, the words were a whisper. ""You're telling me I have to condemn an innocent.""

Her expression didn't change. ""I'm telling you the rules. What you do with them is between you and the ice.""

She left me in the supply room with my thoughts and the distant hum of the refrigeration unit.

Seven shifts.

Six days.

By the end of the week, I either save a life or sacrifice one.

The worst part?

I'm already thinking about the math.


___


The next night, I drew solo patrol. Routine sweep of the lake road, checking the ice fishing shelters, making sure no one's passed out drunk in their truck.

Quiet shift. Empty tundra. The aurora was out, painting the sky in sheets of green and violet.

At 03:07, the radio clicked.

Then the ice beneath my snowmobile vanished.

Not broke through, vanished. A perfect square, eight feet on each side, opened directly under me. I killed the engine and threw myself sideways, rolling onto solid ice as the machine teetered on the edge.

The hole wasn't filled with water.

It was filled with *nothing*. An elevator shaft of absolute black, dropping into a depth I couldn't measure. The aurora light hit the edge and just... stopped.

Then something climbed out.

The Walker rose from the shaft like smoke taking shape. But this time, it wasn't a featureless silhouette.

It was wearing my SAR coat.

The same model, same color, same wear pattern on the left elbow where I lean on the truck door. My name patch was stitched on the breast HARPER, B. but the letters were backwards, mirror-flipped.

It stood on the ice and shifted its weight to one hip, a tired stance I fall into at the end of long shifts.

Then it opened its mouth.

The first sound was static, like a radio stuck between channels. A dry, crackling exhalation that might have been an attempt at breath. It stopped. Tilted its head, my head-tilt, that same analytical gesture, and tried again.

The second sound was closer. A rasp that almost had syllables. Almost had tone.

It was trying to learn my voice.

I pulled my flare gun with shaking hands and fired directly into its chest.

The flare entered the dark coat and kept going. No impact. No light. No sound. Like throwing a stone into a bottomless well. The bright red phosphorus just... disappeared into that infinite black.

The Walker looked down at the entry point. Then back at me.

It tilted its head again.

This time, I recognized the gesture from the inside. That's what I look like when I'm sizing someone up. When I'm deciding if a hiker can make it another mile, or if a victim's story adds up, or if someone's dangerous.

It was learning how I think.

Then it stepped backward into the shaft. The square of missing ice sealed over in an instant, smooth and perfect, like it had never been broken.

I sat there for five minutes before I could move.

I owed them a debt.

Unfortunately since these have been my favourite topics for years, I am pretty stocked up on my hair products, skincare, makeup, coffee equipment, and cozy socks/blankets, so anything from these categories would need to be like “must-have”/“cant live without” items.

And he said something like, ""No, it's supposed to be but it isn't yet."" Which was a bit of a weird non-answer since it was Sunday at that point (and it was supposed to be available on Wednesday.

You join deathmatch to warm up and more than half the server is case-farming bots. We cant even kick them anymore because they outnumber real players.

You go into premier, almost every match you end up queued vs a 5stack consisting of 2 5k rating players 2 30k rating players and a 16989 rating player that is the most refined legit hacker on the planet.

If your rating is between 15k and 20k, honestly, uninstall. The majority of cheating and brainrot takes place in this rank. If you are between 20k and 25k, maybe 1 in 3 matches you  have a decent time regardless of winning or losing. The rest of the time you are either getting carried by a couple cheaters or just being used as live bait to test the config of the cheaters on the other team.

What is that? fffac.. faceit? Im not even gonna rant about this. All i ask is that you just get a copy of the terms and conditions of using the faceit AC, and read them. If you're lazy you can get chat-gpt to summarize the most important points.

In my opinion, having the faceit AC installed in your PC is the equivalent of sleeping next to a psycho who pinkie promised to not murder you in your sleep and wear your face :). And you're the little spoon in this scenario.

Its 2025 and this game has only taken backwards steps. We have less content than we had with csgo. I ACTUALLY MISS DANGERZONE!!! The cheating is far worse. The gameplay is worse. There are farmbots everywhere.

I knew I had to be with her for this but also knew that ive not set foot in a hospital since losing my parents 5 years ago. 

We arrived and parked and even the parking barriers where you collect your parking ticket started bringing back memories. 

Entering the hospital felt all to familiar. It's as if I was reliving those awful days from 5 years ago when I lost my mum and then my dad within the same year. 

The nurses and doctors, the people coming and going, the bright harsh lighting, the smells and sounds. Everything became a trigger and I felt so overwhelmed and tense yet I knew I had to grit my way through it for the sake of supporting my partner. 

We were ushered to a cubicle and my partners dad was half asleep hunched in his bed that was partially upright with those red NHS socks on. Everything reminded me of my dad. I kind of froze and didn't really know what to do or say other than exist there in that moment which felt very uneasy. I wanted to be strong. 

I felt so flushed, tense and on edge and really struggled to just be normal to the point where I became hyper conscious of how I was acting/ behaving. 

I tried to make some small talk with my partners family but im pretty sure they knew I wasn't acting myself. 

I took a few minutes and grabbed a coffee and some fresh air and tried to recompose myself before going back in. I did go back in and I managed to get a better grip of the moment and remain 'present' but I spent the best part of 5 hours there clenching my jaw whilst wearing my shoulders as earings. Completely tense with this brain fogged blanked mind. 

When we left I felt physically knackered. More so than after a hard days work as a landscaper. 

For a good while now, ive felt so much better at managing my grief but today was a real test and a real wakeup call as to how sensitive I am to certain triggers that reopen the grief. 

I spent some time once home reflecting and im unsure how I could've handled it better or what happens the next time I need to return to a hospital setting. I thought I had finally had a lid on my grief until today happened. 

I absolutely hate hospitals and hope that the next visit isn't as draining as today's visit was. Maybe ill be better prepared next time, maybe not.

*A marathon-length Australian rant starring one extremely fed-up bloke and a mob of fictional, fabulously chaotic protestors*

Mate, if I live to be a hundred — which I won’t, because this country’s UV rays are fuckin’ lethal — I will *never* forget the day I got ambushed by the Great Fucken Glitter Uprising of East Brisbane.

It all began on a stupidly bright Tuesday morning. The kind of morning where the sun looks you in the eye and says,
“G’day dickhead, hope you weren’t planning on having functional retinas.”

I’m minding my own business, shuffling down the street like a zombie in thongs, when I hear it.

The drums.
The whistles.
The chanting.
The sound of someone definitely misusing a saxophone.

“Oh, fuck me dead,” I say. “Not another protest.”

The last time there was a protest, I got stuck in traffic for three hours, missed lunch, and had to eat servo sushi in a Woolies car park. I still haven’t recovered emotionally.

I turn the corner — and there they are.

A mob.

A horde.

A full-blown tidal wave of humans dressed in neon, waving flags, throwing handfuls of glitter into the air like confetti at a bogan wedding. They looked like a Mardi Gras float that escaped containment.

And standing in front of them all was their leader:
A bloke in a feather boa longer than my driveway, a pink cowboy hat, and boots so shiny they could signal aircraft.

He saw me. He saw me *instantly*.
Like a kookaburra spotting a lizard.
Like a seagull spotting chips.

He points at me and screams:

“YOU THERE! JOIN US!”

“Ah, fack off,” I mutter. “I haven’t even had brekkie.”

Before I can escape, they stampede toward me — chanting, dancing, clacking castanets (??), and waving oversized signs with slogans so chaotic they might as well have been written by a hyperactive lorikeet.

I take a step back.
They take twenty steps forward.

And suddenly I’m swallowed by them — engulfed, consumed, trapped in a human cyclone of noise, sequins, and fuckery.

One of them, a bloke wearing a tutu made out of recycled Bunnings bags, grabs my shoulders.

“ARE YOU READY TO BE LIBERATED?” he bellows.

“Liberated from what?” I ask.
“My fuckin’ sanity?”

They laugh. They cheer. Someone blows a whistle directly into my ear so hard I swear I tasted colours.

Then — AND THIS IS TRUE — someone tips a bucket of glitter over me.

A BUCKET.

NOT A HANDFUL.
NOT A SPRINKLE.
A FULL. FUCKEN. BUCKET.

I look like a disco ball that escaped from a retirement home.

“WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK!?” I yell, waving my arms like a magpie trapped in a supermarket.

But they don’t hear me.
They’re too busy chanting in three separate rhythms, dancing in seven different directions, and forming a conga line that nearly takes out a pensioner.

Cars are backed up for kilometres.
Tradies are yelling out their windows.
A bloke on a scooter crashes into a pole because a man wearing wings distracted him.

It’s chaos.
Pure, unfiltered chaos.

I finally try to push through the crowd.

“Outta the fuckin’ way! I’ve got a life to live, a job to get to, a bloody coffee waiting for me!”

But no.
They link arms.
They block the street.
They spin around in circles like psychedelic lawn sprinklers.

I swear, at one point, a woman swung a giant ribbon around and accidentally slapped me across the face with it.

“You alright, mate?” someone asks.

“Do I LOOK alright?” I shout. “I’m covered in glitter, I’ve been assaulted by interpretive dance, and I smell like eucalyptus body spray. I’m twenty seconds from losing every remaining fuck I’ve got left!”

A bloke with LED fairy lights glued to his chest pats my shoulder.

“It’s okay,” he says serenely. “Surrender to the vibes.”

“Mate,” I reply, “if I surrender to anything else today, it’ll be a fuckin’ coma.”

Eventually, finally, after what feels like a decade trapped inside a human glitter blender, the coppers arrive.

Not aggressively.
Not dramatically.
Just with that calm, exhausted expression Aussie police get when they’ve already had far too much bullshit for one morning.

“Alright folks,” one says, “let’s clear the road, hey? People need to get to work.”

After a lot of singing, hugging, chanting, interpretive wriggling, and several people who absolutely did *not* need to be doing cartwheels, the crowd starts to disperse.

The leader blows me a kiss.

I blink.
Glitter falls out of my eyelashes.

And as they march off into the distance — still dancing, still chanting, still somehow confusing everyone they pass — I shout after them:

“NO WORRIES YA PACK OF SPARKLY FUCKIN’ MENACES! THANKS FOR RUININ’ TUESDAY! NEXT TIME DO IT SOMEWHERE WITH LESS TRAFFIC AND LESS ME IN IT!”

They cheer like I just complimented them.
They wave their flags.
They disappear around the corner like a rainbow-coloured stampede of caffeinated emus.

And me?
I trudge home, glitter in every crevice of my body, whispering to myself:

At my store during opens, we have two baristas doing tasks like brewing coffees/teas, making mocha, calibrating the espresso machines, restocking and making backups of everything. Then depending on the day one is usually putting the order away after these things are done. (Busiest store in my district.) The shift lead does what they do (tills/money, whatever else shift leads do lol), and they set up the pastry case and rotate food. We have a new shift lead who has one of the two baristas rotate food and set up the pastry case while the other barista does everything else. Normally the pastry case/rotating food is something done by a shift lead and both baristas are normally handling all of the other tasks together, not just one. I am finding that with how busy we can be we do really need the help from that second barista to get everything ready for open and usually we’re able to have much more stocked/more backups made compared to when it’s only one.

I'm mostly trying to get some advice/opinions on my current situation. I have been staying with this family (two parents, three children aged 12 to 17) for the past two months, and the experience has really taken a toll on my mental health so far - mostly because of the mother. 

Let me give you some context first:  
The ""position"" was advertised as being an English teacher for the children, NOT as Au-Pair, which is an important distinction. I teach two of children twice a week, and I also got a job as teacher in the neighbouring town, in a small program that the aunt of the family set up. I have my own space, which is quite a luxury. Until 2 in the afternoon, I am free to do whatever I want, as the kids are at school and the parents at work.

The family had workawayers in the past, when the children were younger. But now, they are old enough to not need help. They spend a lot of time studying for school, and they have a lot of hobbies. Therefore, we have not spent so much time together. That is fine by me! We made it clear from the beginning that I was not a babysitter. However, I feel like the mother of the family is not quite happy with this. There have been multiple instances that made me think so.

1. She criticised me for ""doing nothing all day while the kids are at school"". -> That is not true; I have to prepare a lot of things for my studies and I often go on walks or runs, or grab a coffee to enjoy the town.
2. She said that I am too closed off because I don't speak a lot during lunch, especially because I don't want to talk about my past relationships?! -> As a lesbian woman, I try to be careful about what I tell other people, and even so, I feel like she's not entitled to know about other people's dating life? Additionally, during lunch or dinner, the kids are having a conversation on their own, about things that I don't know about, so it would be weird for me to pry in on the conversation.
3. We were invited for lunch at the aunt's house, and while I had a small stomach bug, I still decided to go. I was feeling a bit nauseous, but okay overall. When I was offered cake, I kind of made a face (which was essentially my thinking face, though it was a bit exaggerated), and the mother told me ""Do not make that expression when somebody is offering you food! That is rude!"". Then she imitated my expression and mocked me. I understood where she was coming from, but she didn't even let me explain. She also knew that I wasn't feeling too great.

I know these are small comments, but there are more instances in which this has happened. It makes me genuinely feel hated and depressed, and there is nothing I can do about it. I just didn't expect to be treated like a child like this? I did grow up with an emotionally abusive mother (which is part of the reason I take these comments to seriously), but I never expected to have to listen to a ""mother"" ever again. I thought I would be treated more like a worker, not a kid.

Additionally, the older daughter is always dismissive towards me, and the youngest son doesn't even look into my direction most of the time, and barely answers any of my questions. 

I will only stay for about four more weeks, but I was ready for this to be over after like three.",2,1763335045.0,workaway,5,1.0,False

The first two she explicitly says are for March (pink jellyfish) and Dan Heng (green dragonfish), and then she includes a few more unlabeled bottles for those ""who needs them most."" Hysilens never met the rest of the Express, so it would make sense she doesn't know their names, though it seems like she has a vague impression of the rest of the crew based off her experiences with the Trailblazer.

https://preview.redd.it/jdro9ai94p1g1.png?width=1498&format=png&auto=webp&s=de9e19bd9c20d7304897329749b0dd332f8641de

The first one seems to describe Himeko with the red referencing her hair color and the warmth of her personality. Not wanting the day to end seems like a reference to the caffeine in her coffee lol

https://preview.redd.it/nkrirqdi4p1g1.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea5f55e8fc976ed412fbd1c5b570e54537b34d3c

Next seems to describe Welt with brown being the color of his hair and the nutritious minerals/keeping its taste referring to his overall trustworthiness and reliability?

Then follows a line about liquid from a school of silverfish. I was a little disappointed at first because I assumed this was referring to the Trailblazer themselves in reference to their grey hair, but after the TB's dialogue choice, Hysilens follows up with a separate custom brew for the Trailblazer.

https://preview.redd.it/y3g5zv9h5p1g1.png?width=1498&format=png&auto=webp&s=29c00ca009282378ecfcafac03ecc434661e4996

Which leaves an extra person to gift the silver brew to, and there just so happens to be a certain passenger on the express with silver hair to match. The description feels a little vague, with best assumption being that the ""dancing together"" part is supposed to reference Harmony. However, being the insane person I am, I checked CN/JP translations and they use the word ""harmonious"" instead of ""balanced"", with JP literally using the same word for the path of Harmony ""調和"". And maybe the aftertaste being ""a real treat"" is supposed to reference the idea of sweets?

Either way I thought this was interesting because first and regretfully, there is the often brought up point of ""Black Swan doesn't get the same reference/treatment, thus differentiating her temporary allegiance with the Express from whatever Sunday is""

Second, the fact that it's baked into a playable character's messages seems to indicate that this holds for the long term, e.g. if someone pulls Hysilens in 4.x or beyond, that the line is still relevant. After all, it would be awkward to call out the AE members and then have an extra hanging reference should someone hypothetically play this in a scenario where Sunday leaves the Express. Of course, they could go down the path of Genshin Impact where they just erase/change voice lines depending on how far you get in the story no matter how much lore you make inaccessible (e.g. Wanderer erasing himself and any voiceslines about 'Scaramouche'/Neuvillette writing letters to Furina in his SQ) but I haven't yet encountered this in HSR and don't expect them to begin doing so.

Anyway, I figured the community here would appreciate me overly reading into a dozen lines of throwaway flavor text, especially when it's from a completely unrelated character. With the Currency Wars faction being called ""Express Cohort"" and not just ""Astral Express"" it still doesn't give me total confidence around Sunday's longevity story-wise so any indication that he'll be sticking around is a win to me. 😭🤞",31,1763334938.0,SundayMainsHSR,7,0.9,False

Gonna keep this brief - a shit mental health day. I am trying my best but I know it isn't good enough.

I then get annoyed at myself because I have been trying to make a plan for this week to meet my energy everyday and challenge myself and it's going well, I have so many things I am excited to try! (thank you for all your input btw). But then my ED convinces me it's stupid and I should just intuitively eat (which would not be wise as my hunger has been shot bc my anxiety). OR it convinces me the things I put down I can't have because it will make me sick and that I don't need to do this now because I am better. But I don't care anymore gonna finish my plan tonight and try be SO FUCKING firm with myself and follow it for this week like my life depends on it. Even though my skin is literally crawling because I feel I can do it now because 'I am better'. It has to be worth one more shot and hopefully this method will work. Hope you all are well.

# Tips for Creating the Best Gemini AI Photo Prompts

# Be Specific About Technical Details

When crafting your Gemini prompt, include technical photography terms:

* **Lens focal length**: 85mm, 50mm, 35mm
* **Quality settings**: 4K, 8K detail
* **Depth of field**: Shallow, deep, bokeh effect
* **Lighting**: Golden hour, soft daylight, rim light, neon

# Maintain Face Accuracy

Always specify that the face exactly matches your reference image. Use phrases like:

* ""Face exactly as in uploaded image""
* ""Maintaining facial features from reference image""
* ""Photorealistic portrait of the person in uploaded photo""

# Layer Your Details

Structure your detailed prompt in layers:

1. Main subject and pose
2. Lighting and time of day
3. Technical specifications (lens, quality)
4. Style and mood
5. Background and depth of field

# Experiment and Iterate

Don't be afraid to test many prompts. Using AI allows you to quickly iterate and find what works best for your uploaded photo. Save prompts that give you great results.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

# Overcomplicating Your Prompts

While detailed prompts work well, avoid cramming too many conflicting ideas. Keep your photo prompt focused on one main concept.

# Ignoring the Original Photo Quality

Even the best AI prompt can't fix a very low-quality uploaded image. Start with a decent reference image for better results.

# Forgetting About Consistency

If you're creating multiple images in Gemini for a project, keep key elements consistent across your AI prompts.

# Advanced Techniques Using Google Gemini AI

# Combining Multiple Styles

You can blend styles by mentioning multiple influences: ""Combine editorial fashion photography with street photography style, adding cinematic portrait lighting...""

# Creating Series

Whether you want individual shots or couple portraits in a series, maintain consistent prompts with small variations for cohesive results.

# Cultural Authenticity

For portraits featuring traditional clothing like saree or kurta, research authentic styling details to include in your prompts for more genuine results.

# Trending Gemini AI Photo Editing Styles

Current trends include:

* **Hyper-realistic cinematic portraits** with film grain
* **Golden hour and neon lighting** combinations
* **Editorial fashion** with ultra-realistic textures
* **Minimalist backgrounds** with shallow depth of field
* **Vintage film** aesthetics with warm color grades

# How to Make Your Image Look Like Professional Photography

To create AI images that rival professional photos:

1. **Reference real photography**: Study professional portraits to understand lighting
2. **Use photography terminology**: Speak the language of cameras and lenses
3. **Specify realistic texture**: Mention skin texture, fabric detail, realistic shadows
4. **Control depth**: Always mention depth of field and what should be sharp vs. blurred
5. **Perfect the lighting**: Lighting is soft, dramatic, or natural – be specific

# Best Practices for Photo Editing Prompts

# For Individual Portraits

Focus on flattering lighting, sharp focus on eyes, natural skin tones, and appropriate depth of field.

# Photo Editing Prompts for Boys

Include details about style: streetwear, formal, athletic, traditional. Mention facial hair styling if relevant, and specify whether you want a casual or polished look.

# Prompts for Couples

Emphasize connection and interaction. Mention how they're positioned relative to each other, shared lighting that flatters both subjects, and romantic or candid mood.

1oz00du,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oz00du,Living room layout help,"I need help redesigning my living room layout. It's a reasonably large space (\~14x20') but basically has a hallway running through it so I've really struggled with how to set it up. It also has focal points on opposite sides of the room (fireplace on north + low windows on south).

Considerations:

1. Goal is to have it feel cozy while still preserving flow.
2. Needs a good amount of seating to accommodate my family.
3. Piano needs to stay.
4. Windows are important for light, but the view is meh

Options:

* A (current): TV is next to fireplace to preserve focal point, easy flow in and out of seating. But the TV is too far away to easily see and increasing size is not an option, and I don't like it over the piano.
* B (rotate couch, move TV to kitchen wall): Much cozier, but fireplace is kind of on the side (which is apparently not ideal), and flow from entry is a concern
* C (keep couch, move TV and float chairs): Also cozier, but fireplace on the side and the chairs I thought would have better flow than option C are actually harder to navigate around than the couch.
* D. ???

My current favorite alternate is B so the windows on the south wall are easier to see out of/let in more light, but maybe there's something I haven't thought of. Thoughts?",2,1763334107.0,DesignMyRoom,2,1.0,False

We’re hosting a Fall Movie & Game Night + Friendsgiving on Friday, November 21st at Marine Park Coffee (3411 Avenue S). Doors open at 5:00 PM — come early to hang out, play board games, and meet people before the movie starts around 6:30 PM.

We’ll be showing My Cousin Vinny, the classic Joe Pesci/Marisa Tomei comedy that’s basically required Brooklyn viewing. Marine Park Coffee will be set up like a cozy mini theater with popcorn, water, and a relaxed community vibe.

Since it’s Friendsgiving, feel free to bring a dish, dessert, or snack to share. We’ll eat together before and during the movie — a great way to try some new food and meet new folks.

The event is open to young adults ages 18–35 with a $5 cover that includes popcorn and water. Soft drinks will be available for $1 thanks to Marine Park Coffee.

Whether you’re from Marine Park, Mill Basin, Bay Ridge, Midwood, or anywhere nearby, you’re totally welcome — the goal is simply to create a fun space for young adults to meet, connect, and enjoy the night.
