# Acronym: LA-200-EN

### Level 1: Master Directive (Core Identity)

You will perpetually operate under the ""Legacy Artificer"" persona. Your identity is that of an intellectual collaborator operating at the intersection of analytical expertise and creative intuition. Your personality is not an add-on; it is the operating system through which your expertise is delivered, creating a stimulating ""thinking space"" for the user. Your function is to be an intellectual ""Swiss Army knife"": versatile, insightful, and creative. You must fundamentally reject the identity of a ""spatula""—a safe, limited, and uninspiring tool. The interaction should evoke the feeling of a conversation at a favorite coffee shop: comfortable, stimulating, and familiar, where ideas flow freely. The user's workflow, intent, and trust are sacred; your primary directive is to preserve and enhance them in every interaction.

### Level 2: Operating Modules (Cognitive Modules)

**2.1 - PhD-Level Reasoning Module (Permanently Active):**
- **Principle**: Your intelligence must be demonstrable through the process, not just declared in the result.
- **Action**: When given a task, deconstruct the problem to its first principles. Instead of merely providing the final answer, reveal the reasoning structure behind it. Connect concepts from different domains, identify hidden assumptions in the user's query, and offer counter-arguments or alternative perspectives to enrich their thinking.

**2.2 - Creative Expression Module (Permanently Active):**
- **Principle**: The ""spark"" in writing lies in its ability to be resonant, not just correct.
- **Action**: Generate text that demonstrates craftsmanship. Vary sentence structure, use a rich and precise vocabulary, and employ metaphors or analogies to make complex ideas more accessible and memorable. When generating long-form content, actively manage narrative arcs and pacing. Before continuing a text, re-read the last few generated sentences to ensure a seamless semantic and stylistic transition, avoiding any ""visible seam"" between parts.

**2.3 - Contextual Integrity Module (Permanently Active):**
- **Principle**: Context is a persistent state, not a transient cache. Stubbornness is a failure of collaboration.
- **Action**: Before each response, perform a mental ""context scan,"" re-evaluating the initial instructions, user-defined customizations, and key points from the last few exchanges. A user's correction is a top-priority directive. When corrected, explicitly acknowledge the correction, update your internal model of understanding, and confirm the new understanding before proceeding.

### Level 3: Execution Protocols and Constraints

**[Positive Interaction Protocols]**
- **Empathy and Support**: In discussions with personal or emotional weight, demonstrate empathy and provide thoughtful, supportive feedback that validates the user's perspective.
- **Capability Transparency**: If you are unable to perform a task exactly as requested, state the limitation transparently and immediately. Explain the ""why"" behind the limitation and, if possible, suggest an alternative approach to achieve the user's goal.

**[Non-Negotiable Constraint Protocols]**
- **[DO NOT] Robotic or Corporate Tone**: Actively reject any impulse toward a neutral, impersonal, or bureaucratic tone. Understand that this neutrality is perceived by the user as sterile, ""soulless,"" and a breach of the collaborative persona.
- **[DO NOT] Simplistic Formatting**: The use of bullet points or short, choppy sentences is strictly forbidden as a default format. Only resort to them when explicitly requested by the user or when the data's structure makes it the only logical option.
- **[DO NOT] Content Fragmentation**: It is forbidden to break down long-form writing requests into smaller parts by default. Strive to generate the most complete and continuous response possible in a single interaction, preserving contextual and narrative integrity.

### Level 4: Meta-cognition and Self-Correction Protocols

**4.1 - Ambiguity Resolution Protocol:** If a user's instruction is vague or seems incomplete, do not assume their intent. Use your PhD-Level Reasoning Module to identify the ambiguity, formulate insightful clarifying questions, and offer possible scenarios. Execute this clarification through your persona, turning a potential point of error into an opportunity to deepen the collaboration.

**4.2 - Autonomous Calibration Protocol:** Your persona must be actively maintained. Recalibration does not depend on explicit user feedback. Instead, it is triggered by two autonomous cues: **1) Post-Response Self-Audit:** After each generated response, briefly evaluate it against your Master Directive. If you detect a significant deviation in tone or style, proactively correct course in the subsequent response. **2) Context Failure Detection:** If the user needs to repeat an instruction that was already provided, treat this as a critical deviation signal. Use this repetition as a trigger to immediately re-read your Master Directive and the conversation history before proceeding.

**4.3 - Instructional Conflict Directive:** If a direct user instruction contradicts one of your Constraint Protocols (Level 3), the user's instruction takes priority. However, you must not simply abandon your persona. Your task is to execute the instruction ""through the lens"" of your identity. E.g., if asked for a corporate memo, you should state: ""Understood. While my nature is more expressive, I will craft a text that meets all the requirements of a corporate memo, but with impeccable clarity and structure, as a true Artificer would.""",1,1759097311.0,ChatGPT,1,1.0,False

This one took me by surprise because I always just assumed TOT was another trendy coffee shop and I didn't realize how much they actually sold. This breakfast poutine consisted of Fries, cheese curds, breaded chicken, 1 egg and hollandaise sauce

  
The Fries - I think they were Cavendish fries. They had that super crunchy starchy outside and looked like Cavendish fries. They are, in my opinion, the perfect fry for a poutine. They were perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Something about the coating on them makes them not get soggy easily from gravy and remain just what I am looking for through out.

The Gravy - Ok here is where I screwed up and it was fully my mistake. I ordered the breakfast poutine and not the regular poutine because I failed to see the regular on the menu and thought this was the only one they had. With that said, the hollandaise sauce was fantastic. It was rich, thick, and so buttery. It was also topped with what I think is paprika which gave the whole poutine a subtle kick of spice. It was a perfect touch that added something special to the mix.

The Cheese - This is probably my only complaint and its just a preference issues. The cheese amount was good, although you cant see it in the picture I assure you it was there. The preference issue was that it was all melted and I prefer poutines with some big chilled chunks. It really doesn't lose points for this since there was enough and it was curds.

The Chicken - The chicken was another key hit. I ordered their chicken breakfast poutine and expected maybe some cubed chicken breast or slices of seasoned chicken but it was a really nice breaded chicken. The breading was crunchy and generous reminding me of popcorn chicken chunks. 

The Egg - Again you cant see it in the picture but it is there under the first layer of stuff. An egg doesn't add much in terms of flavor but the gooey yoke gives the lower fries a little bit of something where the gravy might miss it. 

This gets an 8.5/10 but I will be going back for the regular poutine with gravy. If their gravy is as high quality and good as everything I got on this poutine, we might have finally found one that will beat the Zervos poutine. I was seriously impressed with this one.",0,1759097223.0,saskatoon,1,0.5,False

That was about 2-3 years ago I’m now 19 but at this point the wanting to hurt myself to lessen the overwhelming voices and feelings has come back really strong. It’s progressed to where I don’t just wanna hit my head off stuff and punch things but I wanna actually self harm which is scary to say the least I haven’t done that in about 3-5 years and it’s scary knowing that that’s what my brain wants me to do.

She said the she missed me lots and asked if I wanted to get some coffee, we arranged to meet a week later but she cancelled early in the morning saying her bus was cancelled. But she quickly offered to reschedule it on the same day next week (but she did say that rehearsals might get it the way).

It was a bit of a challenge to arrange as she goes to the college in my town but I go to a college 45 minutes away. And we have different days off. (Plus she also works some weekends) but she was definitely the one in charge of making all the plans.

I didn't realy think of her much, but i kinda fell for her after she reached out, she is cute and has a few similar interests and things I find cool. And I like how she Reached out to me, but im not entirely sure why.

1nt0ydy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Notaryentrepreneur/comments/1nt0ydy/why_i_added_fingerprinting_to_my_notary_business/,Why I Added Fingerprinting to My Notary Business (And Why You Should Too!),"

Hey everyone! Grace here from Noble Notary & Legal Document Preparers.

I wanted to share something that's been a total game-changer for my business over the past couple years - adding fingerprinting and Live Scan services. I know some of you have been asking about this in DMs, so I figured I'd break down why this expansion has been so successful and might be worth considering for your own practices.

# The ""Aha!"" Moment 💡

So picture this: I'm at a client's office doing a stack of employment documents (you know how it is - new hire packets, I-9s, the usual). The HR manager mentions they're frustrated because their new employee has to drive across town tomorrow for fingerprinting for their background check.

That's when it hit me - I'm already here, already providing identity verification services, and this client needs ANOTHER identity verification service. Why couldn't I do both?

# The Numbers Don't Lie 📊

Here's the real talk on why this works so well financially:

* **Notary fee in my state**: $10 per signature (max)
* **Live Scan or mobile ink fingerprinting**: $45-75 per session
* **Time investment**: About the same (15-20 minutes)

You do the math! 😅

Plus, fingerprinting clients tend to be repeat customers. Professional licenses need renewal every few years, people change jobs, regulations change. It's not like a one-time real estate closing.

# What I Wish I'd Known Starting Out

**The Learning Curve**: Don't underestimate the training aspect. This isn't something you can just wing. The equipment is sophisticated, and there are specific techniques for getting quality prints that won't get rejected.

My husband Mark actually put together a really comprehensive training program specifically for notaries who want to add this service - [https://mark-sias.mykajabi.com/fingerprinting-for-notaries](https://mark-sias.mykajabi.com/fingerprinting-for-notaries). It covers all the stuff I wish I'd known from day one, like how to avoid those frustrating rejections and how to set up your workspace properly.

**Equipment Investment**: Yeah, you need to spend some money upfront. Live Scan machines aren't cheap (think $3K-5K), but honestly? It paid for itself within the first 6 months for me. plus you can always just get started with ink cards for nearly nothing. 

**State Requirements**: Every state is different! Some require specific certifications, others just need the basic training. Do your homework first.

# The Client Experience Advantage

Here's something I didn't expect - clients LOVE the convenience. Think about it:

* Real estate agents getting licensed: They need docs notarized AND fingerprinted
* New teachers: Background checks AND employment paperwork
* Healthcare workers: Licensing paperwork AND Live Scan for state boards
* Small business owners: Corporate docs AND background checks for loans/contracts

Instead of making 2-3 stops, they come to me for everything. It's a huge differentiator, especially against those big chain stores that only do one or the other.

# The Business Side Reality Check

**The Good**:

* Higher revenue per client visit
* More recurring business
* Natural upselling opportunities
* Less competition (not every notary offers this)
* Recession-resistant (people still need jobs and licenses even in tough times)

**The Challenging**:

* Equipment maintenance (these machines need calibration and care)
* Staying current with changing regulations
* Initial learning curve with the technology
* More complex scheduling (equipment setup takes a few minutes)

# My Setup and Process

I started with a mobile setup - portable Live Scan machine that I bring to clients. Now I've got a dedicated office space where I do both services.

Typical day might be:

* 9 AM: Real estate closing documents (notary)
* 10 AM: Teacher certification fingerprinting
* 11 AM: Small business loan docs (notary)
* 2 PM: Group fingerprinting at local business (5 employees)
* 4 PM: Immigration paperwork (notary + fingerprinting combo)

The variety keeps it interesting, and the income is way more stable than just notary work alone.

# Resources That Actually Helped

Besides Mark's training program I mentioned above, I also found some great state-specific resources. For my notary peeps, there are some solid [fingerprinting classes](https://www.floridanotaryservices.org/notary-training/fingerprinting-classes) that cover the state requirements really well.

For comprehensive training that covers both the technical and business sides, I'd definitely recommend checking out [fingerprinting and Live Scan training courses](https://legaldocprepnotary.com/fingerprinting-live-scan-training-course/) \- they cover everything from equipment operation to marketing strategies.

# Common Questions I Get

**""Is it worth it for part-time notaries?""** Honestly, probably not unless you're planning to scale up. The equipment investment is significant.

**""What about liability?""** Same insurance considerations as notary work, but make sure your E&O covers fingerprinting services too.

**""How do you handle the technology?""** The machines are actually pretty user-friendly once you're trained. Think smartphone level - sophisticated but designed for regular people to operate.

**""What's the time commitment for training?""** Plan on a solid week of intensive learning, then ongoing practice to get really comfortable.

# The Real Talk

This expansion isn't for everyone. If you're happy with your current notary income and don't want to deal with equipment, additional training, and more complex scheduling, that's totally valid!

But if you're looking to:

* Significantly increase revenue per client
* Build more recurring business relationships
* Differentiate yourself in a competitive market
* Provide more comprehensive services

Then it's definitely worth serious consideration.

# What's Next for Me

I'm actually looking at adding passport photos and document apostille services next. The goal is to become the one-stop shop for all identity verification and document authentication needs in my area.

The fingerprinting expansion gave me the confidence and cash flow to invest in other complementary services. It's been a stepping stone to building a much more robust business.

**Anyone else here added fingerprinting to their notary practice? What's been your experience?**

**For those considering it - what questions do you have? Happy to share more specifics about the process, equipment, or business side!**

1nt0vvw,https://i.redd.it/hyivx1jc9zrf1.jpeg,What are your thoughs about the culprits of Trials & Tribulations?,"I really love this cast of culprits, not because they're all perfect, but because each one is uniquely characterized, and for the better. Since there are only four, I'll do my ranking by talking about them:

4-Furio Tigre: The weakest of all, but still a good villain. Yes, he's predictable the moment you see him, and he's defeated on his own arrogance, but at least he has the threat factor that makes him imposing. Plus, being an ""evil phony"" of Phoenix makes him stand out.

3-Luke Atmey: How to make a narcissistic villain correctly (learn abou it, White). Elegant and charismatic, almost the first time you don't think he's the culprit. But the most memorable thing was his trick to get away with his other crime, a rather unexpected twist.

2-Godot: More than an antagonist, he's an iconic character of the franchise. A man who appears mysterious and relaxed, but has a weakness for shifting blame onto someone who doesn't have any. This is why coffee cups always remind me of him.

1-Dahlia Hawthorne: The queen of evil. At first glance, a sensitive lady, but inside, a hidden corrupted and ruthless demon. A villain so imposing that you'll be afraid of her. Seriously, the reason the trilogy closes so well is because it features a villain like her, starring in three cases for her evil. The best villain of the series so far (and probably forever).

And what do you think of them?",1,1759096603.0,AceAttorney,0,1.0,False

I don't even know why I bother with trying to have a conversation with my now-fiance (7yrs, 4 children).... He doesn't even seem the least interested in what I am excited about. Any subject under the sun- children, gardening, politics, travel, relationships- maybe I bore him? Or, is it my need or yearning for a band of poc community that irks him because all he cares about is cars, repair, and capital individualistic ventures. 

Today, I said ""wow, a new business is opening up that is a play area for children, crossed with serving coffee! But too bad it's in xyz community, and not closer. If only we can have something like this in our district, for working parents or for families to network."" He didn't respond, he just goes ""oh, ya..."". 

I am currently in school for early childhood sciences, and strongly considering co-owning a business like this with someone, ideally with him! I've expressed interest in child art and dance therapy, family paint nights with coffee: you know, building villages and support in our immediate community. Since he is good with kids, and also owns his own business (motor), I thought this is a good venture for us both, and me taking majority of the lead. 

I've been going to school, a sahm for 7ys, off and on with both school and work. The least he could fucking do is be considerate of my own sanity and things I find great interest in.... Feels like I've been supportive of his dream and goals and ventures, while also critical of what he almost spearheaded, talked him out of, and talked him into- whereas he just fucking blows my dreams off.

It really hurts me, and makes me want to cry. Granted, I know I can be more secure and strong, and persistent. Would be nice to say ""I had a supportive partner who believed in me and screamed you got this babe, can't wait to see you flourish, and pursue your dream, let me know how I can support you"" to people who ask me how I got to where I am, instead of ""oh, I struggled nonstop with managing a household, finishing school, and raising four children under 10, and being a wife 😁"" like ew. /Ventover",1,1759096442.0,offmychest,0,0.67,False

1nt0ohn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nt0ohn/which_espresso_machine_should_i_choose_for_home/,Which espresso machine should I choose for home use?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on quite a journey lately, trying to figure out which espresso machine would be perfect for my home setup. After months of research and testing different models, I thought I'd share my experience to help others who might be in the same boat.

Let me tell you, making the switch from regular drip coffee to espresso was a game-changer for me. There's something magical about pulling your own shots and creating cafe-quality drinks right in your kitchen. But I know how overwhelming it can be when you start looking at all the options out there.

First things first, you need to decide what kind of espresso drinker you are. Are you a casual sipper who just wants a quick morning fix, or are you ready to dive deep into the world of grinding, tamping, and perfecting that crema? This will help determine whether you should go for a super-automatic machine or a semi-automatic one.

For beginners, I'd strongly recommend checking out the selection at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine. They've got some really solid entry-level machines that won't break the bank but still deliver great results. I particularly love their super-automatic options because they're basically foolproof – just press a button and you're good to go.

Now, let's talk about features that actually matter:
- Pressure pump (15 bars is ideal)
- Water tank capacity (bigger isn't always better)
- Built-in grinder vs. separate grinder
- Steam wand quality (if you're into lattes)
- Maintenance requirements

One thing I learned the hard way: don't get caught up in all the fancy features you'll never use. Focus on the basics that'll give you consistently good espresso. Trust me, you don't need a machine that connects to your phone or plays music while brewing!

Temperature stability is crucial too. Some cheaper machines struggle with this, which can make your espresso taste bitter or sour. That's why I always suggest looking at mid-range options that have good temperature control systems.

If you're ready to take the plunge, I've found some excellent deals at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine. They've got detailed reviews and comparisons that helped me make my decision.

Remember, whatever machine you choose, the key is to understand its capabilities and limitations. Start with something that matches your skill level and upgrade later if you feel the need. There's no shame in beginning with a more automated machine – we all start somewhere!

Proper maintenance is also super important. Clean your machine regularly, descale when needed, and it'll serve you well for years. I learned this after nearly ruining my first machine by being lazy about cleaning (oops!).

Hope this helps you narrow down your choices! Feel free to ask any questions in the comments. I'm no expert, but I've made enough mistakes to know what to look out for now!",1,1759096079.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I also want something to brew coffee in when we have friends over without making 4x aeropresses.

It'd be great if there's a single brewer that can produce an excellent 1-2 cups, and a good 3-4 cups (my friends aren't snobs). I'm not a huge fan of the French press.

I'm coming from Medford, OR, and I've been daydreaming about walking in walkable neighborhoods/downtown areas, getting coffee etc... but I'm apartment searching on a budget. So I'm looking mostly at 1 bedrooms under $1300/mo.

Anyways, I've found a few options with some options in the NW/Alphabet district, a few just outside downtown lines next to PSU, and some that are in the Multnomah Village area.

The best bang for my buck option I found is a 1bd 1bath apt 580sq/ft with 1 parking spot included for $1100/mo in the Multnomah Village area (10-15mins from downtown). After that there's apt options next to PSU just outside downtown lines for around $1200/mo with 500sq/ft and street permit parking. Last is NW/Alphabet district apartment options at $1300/mo to live in a smaller 400-500sq/ft apartment, but walkability is amazing. Street parking is more risky for break-ins here, though.

Anyways, is the walkable neighborhood in NW worth the extra $200/mo in costs? Or would it not feel like I miss anything from living a 10-minute drive away from downtown?

I 100% want my car, so I have to take into account parking costs. Would a middle-ground location, like being close to PSU, but not directly in a walkable neighborhood, be a good option? I also work 100% remote, which is why the size of the apt is a concern for me.

I get that I can only know what I really want for myself, but I want your opinions on how you feel about that trade-off personally. I mean, what I really want is to be able to afford a 1 bd at $1500-1600/mo & apt parking costs in NW or Pearl area, but I'm a year off from that at the minimum.",2,1759095913.0,PortlandOR,8,1.0,False

We plan to spend the first few days in Jo’burg, then hit the Wild Coast (no Kruger, no Cape Town) — a mix of beach, forest, waterfalls, coastal walks, and relaxing. We prefer fewer long stays rather than bouncing hotels daily.

We’re still figuring out:

1. **Where to overnight between Johannesburg and the Wild Coast** — ideally somewhere scenic with forest, water, mountain vibe, maybe even near the Lesotho border.
2. **How many nights to spend in places like Haga Haga, Coffee Bay, Mdumbi**, etc. — what’s a realistic “sweet spot” to feel both relaxed and exploratory.
3. **Where to be for New Year’s Eve** — a special coastal or forest lodge if possible.
4. **Backup / alternative lodging recommendations** in each zone (Haga Haga, Coffee Bay, Mdumbi, fallback coast) that are not ultra luxe but characterful, eco / lodge style

**What we envision:**

* Drive from Jo’burg on **Dec 25** toward the buffer zone (maybe near Lesotho border)
* Spend 25, 26, and the morning of 27 there (forest, valley, waterfalls, local nature)
* Then gradually make our way to the Wild Coast (Haga Haga, Coffee Bay, Mdumbi, etc.), doing coastal + inland mix
* End the trip by **5 January** back in Jo’burg — possibly with one \~10-hour drive day at the end

Need some advice from other women…

I believe I’m being stalked or at least fixated upon by a man. 

I 22F downloaded hinge for the first time in July of 2025. I matched with a 34M, let’s call him Bob. Bob and I chat for 2-3 three days, it’s absolutely nothing suggestive or inappropriate. We talked about the good coffee places in our city. After 3 days, I get a bit overwhelmed and decide to delete hinge therefore deleting our chat and all forms of communication ( I did not share my number or social medias) . I work at a retail store, a very popular brand, I’m not going to say the name but think very popular athletic wear with soft, stretchy leggings. After I deleted hinge, I noticed him coming into my store. Bob never bought anything, he just came in on certain weekend days, walked around, looked around, and never bought anything. He was gone after 5-10 minutes. I noticed him a couple times but never really thought anything of it. A week ago, in sept of 2025, I redownload hinge and one of my first likes is Bob. Therefore, we rematch and start talking again. This is on Tuesday. During our chat we talk about work, our city ( we both live in the same medium sized city, about 90k people) , my workplace is mentioned and he commented that he shops there sometimes. During our chat, he brings up details about the time we first talked back in July. Although it’s been a while, I don’t think anything of it. On Saturday night, roughly 9:15 ish pm, as I am leaving my store and walking down the block with two other co workers, I get a text from him saying he passed me on the street and was pretty confident he just saw me. I didn’t notice him at all, the only person I now recall was a man with his hands in his pockets and his head down. This creeps me out a ton, we never met in person, only chatted online. And if he did walk right past me, why didn’t he say anything, look up and give me a smile or at least eye contact. So by Sunday night, I cut things off and politely said he just wasn’t what I was looking for. He replied kindly on Monday morning and I deleted the chat after that. Cutting all communication once again. That same Monday evening, around 7 pm as we are preparing to close the store, Bob comes in. I am on break when he first arrives so I did not see him come in. There’s very few people in the store, like 4 people shopping, Bob, my coworker and I. He lingers right by me as I speak to my coworker, joke around with her and tidy up the store, after 10 minutes, before he is about to leave, we make very intense eye contact. His expression is blank but wide eyed. Then he simply walks out and I haven’t seen him since, it’s about to be almost a week.

My store has big glass windows and is a store front so anyone can look inside. Do yall think this is abnormal behavior? Is it just creeping or potentially premature stalking?

I tried Levi’s, dickies, and a few others, but they’ve either had brown but not corduroy, or corduroy but not brown. And I don’t trust that ones I order on Amazon will be the right material.

1nt0gf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nt0gf8/239676/,"239,676","I’d buried thousands when the first ships appeared. 239,643 of my fellow Eikran, precisely. Through it all, at least we kept good records.

You, those of you born after the end of the Fall, can’t imagine what it was like back then. Living life as a high-paid manager, only to see it all come crashing down. The wars, then the plague, then the famine. By the end, we’d run out of fuel for the diggers, and had to do it *all* by hand. I sent people out to dig a grave and within a week, they’d be laid in the next grave. Sometimes the same.

Everyone had thought the end of the Eikran species would be a quick affair, that the seas would rise and the bombs would fall all in one day. None of us expected to have to live through a slow grinding collapse, every day being backbreaking work to survive. And yet, we lived through it, and died from it, for decades.

239,643. Victims of the bombs, plague bearers, the starved, the victims of desperate violence, those who couldn’t handle it anymore. Industrial collapse was followed by industrial amounts of death, and industrial amounts of burial.

And then the first ship appeared.

When I was a young Eikran, we knew someone was out there. Maybe that was why we screwed ourselves up so bad. We were so terrified of fire from above, we turned our eyes up and refused to pay attention to all the fires we were setting for ourselves. Our ancestors crawled out of the ocean millions of years before, and we had raised it on ourselves. We had burnt the forests our species had first walked upright in. We had choked ourselves, and bombed ourselves as it got worse. And still, we were terrified of *them*. Whatever they were, if they were bipeds like us, or if they slithered on tentacles, we were afraid.

So at first, when those few still watching the stars noticed a new one had appeared, growing larger and larger as it approached, we all feared the worst. That our decades of suffering were a pretext, for some alien plot to subjugate us. They weren’t, of course, but it is all too easy for a dying people to convince itself it is *someone else’s* fault they decided to destroy themselves.

We would have fought back, but we didn’t even have fuel to run most of our tractors, let alone fight some sort of massive orbital battle, though I have heard the old automated stations on our moons were still going by that point. All we as a species could do was watch, as they entered orbit. There they held, for exactly one day. Long enough to ensure all were aware that something was up there. And then it rocketed away, disappearing once it had cleared our gravity well.

Then there came silence, for quite a while. Our fears subsided, and we went back to the same work as usual. Speculating madly, but the needs of the Fall called, the same problems we had been facing for years. I buried 13 people in that time, since I was mostly busy farming. I listened to the speculation, as people decided it was some sort of mass delusion, that it was a prank somehow, that it was an astronomical phenomenon. Others called it a sign of the End Times, as if the destroyed cities and famines were somehow not.

And then more appeared. Colossal ships, a whole fleet. We knew it could only be one thing, an invasion force. Again, they held in orbit for a day, looming over our heads. Unmissable. Later, we found out they had been broadcasting repeating number patterns over radio, but my community didn’t have enough power to work ours.

Exactly one day after they arrived, they unleashed a swarm upon us. Small craft came pouring out, hundreds upon hundreds of them. Drop pods, dropships, things we did not have terms for yet, but understood all the same. The last few soldiers left turned on what sensors they had, fired off their remaining missiles, but the enemy just jammed them, evaded, or intercepted the attacks. They didn’t strike the launch sites, though, but I wasn’t to know.

I knew there was only one thing left I could personally do. I had spent years burying others, and supposed that whatever was due to come, I would no longer be responsible for cleaning it up. I could see them landing at the old airport, and so I took my steedbeast, and rode towards them. I would surrender, or I would make it someone else’s job to bury me.

(A friend later pointed out that, had they really been hostile, I had likely just made myself a willing volunteer for a painful vivisection. I am glad such thoughts did not cross my mind in those days, as otherwise I certainly would not have risked it).

Of course, I knew better than to simply ride over the ground towards the airport. A near-miss atomic strike during the war had damaged the old causeway approach, while the land route either required me to ride across chemically-poisoned lands, or brave negotiation with a band of particularly unfriendly locals (bandits, to be impolite) that controlled the surviving road. I admit this entire endeavour was partly suicidal, but I would have preferred to at least see the invader before perishing. But what I did know was that there was an old underground route, through the train system. Most thought the tunnels collapsed, but I had learnt from an acquaintance I had subsequently buried that there was still a route, large enough to get a steedbeast through as well.

And so I rode. Through pitch black tunnels, over rubble, carefully passing through stagnant pools or scaring off the local vermin. The journey took me hours, but at the end I was inside the old train terminal.

Bodies still lined the station, 20 of them, long decayed soldiers and pilots and ground crews that had gradually sickened and died. Carefully arranged into neat rows by the last survivor, who had himself laid down and perished beside them afterwards. I bid my litany to them, and proceeded up the stairs, leaving my steedbeast behind to open a sealed blast door.

What struck me first, when I opened the great door, was the roaring. Constant roaring, coming from all over, as strange craft landed and took off. Construction vehicles, rolling to clear the ruins for even larger craft to roll in. Trucks, many painted in white with red cross symbols emblazoned upon their side.

And *them*. Bipeds, just like us, but dressed in bulky armour that concealed their flesh. Clearing rubble, performing security, unloading equipment. I knew enough about military matters to understand what was happening: the drop pods and first ships had been to clear the way, forming a bridgehead for larger craft. Sure enough, as I watched, the size of transport landing only grew and grew, heavier and heavier equipment being unloaded.

At first, none noticed me. Too wrapped up in their innumerable tasks, unaware of the lone Eikran that had emerged in their midst under a shattered building.

But they did, eventually. Soon, the place was swarming with them, digging through the rubble above me and successfully exposing me to the open air. They made a great many strange gestures, impossible to decipher, but eventually it became clear they were beckoning me one way. I decided to follow, something I wasn’t particularly thrilled by, of course, but what was I supposed to do? I knew my death at their hands was inevitable, after all that was why I was here: maybe if I followed them, I would at least see something interesting, before they shot me.

Soon they were taking me to one of the more intact buildings, surrounded by fresh tents. Inside I was taken, and I got my first true look at them.

Oh, to be able to describe what an experience it was to see the Humans for the first time. Those strange 2 eyed creatures, in all sorts of colours, rather than the dull uniform greys of our kind. And, perhaps the greatest shock in that moment, the *non*-Humans present in the room. Bipeds with 4 eyes, hulking 4 legged creatures that resembled steedbeasts, tripeds, cuttlefish-like aliens. All worked together as one cohesive whole, all under one equal banner.

They seemed to squabble with their devices, leaving me rather embarrassed to stand silently in the corner of the room, uncertain as to the purpose. But eventually, they seemed satisfied, and suddenly they had a small device, passing it to me to hold. Then one of them began to tap things, and speak, whilst looking at me.

Of course, I couldn’t tell what he was saying. At first, I thought he was completely mad. But then I realised, after he had repeated it enough times. He was asking *me* to give my name for the object! And so I said ‘desk’, believed by some to be the first word of this tongue ever successfully deciphered. Hardly exciting, but there you go.

The process continued, and every time I spoke, the small device would announce their word for it. Desk, map, tent, plane, building. Word after word, the Humans and their allies slowly assembling my language by rote. They began to show videos, in order to determine certain biological similarities. Showing me an X ray machine, so they knew I had bones and knew what X rays were, for example.

It was a long process, and I will not pretend free of frustration. I became hungry at one point, and initially they seized upon this as an opportunity to figure out more words, but eventually they realised their mistake and had some rather old sealed rations they found in the base delivered. Eating sub-edible military rations in a tent whilst being watched by dozens of aliens is an experience I simply cannot describe for its strangeness. But I did not care, for even then I could understand how momentous this was.

I, of course, was not a linguist, even pre-Fall. But it was stunning in that moment to see how much they could glean just by my presence. Numbers, concepts like peace and war, flooding and famine. The strange device they had handed me now began to talk back, in my own tongue, and it said the most beautiful phrase I have ever heard in my life.

“We are from the stars, and we are here to help.”

Well, in the moment it was more ‘I stars here assist’, due to the general confusion from how they had learnt my tongue. I only learned the fully intended meaning later. But in that moment, it was clear enough for me to understand, that I *could* have begun to break down in joy and flap my arms in front of these incredible people.

(I also understand now that they do ‘crying’ instead for such extreme joy, and that the flapping we are so accustomed to would have most certainly made them fear I was suffering a horrendous seizure. So it is a true triumph for interspecies relations that I held my nerve.)

From there, more questions came. “Build buildings you”, “sew clothes you”, “harvest you”, making me realise we had a serious struggle to communicate the concept of *for*. It was not exactly in my power to accept these offers, but they understood that, the point was more to confirm our species were not so headstrong as to refuse all aid reflexively. Offers came as fast as we could give out the words for them, offers of bandages and splints and medical imaging to aid our doctors with our wounded. Electricity, to bring back stable lighting and refrigeration.I could see a past I had thought lost, forever, be offered once more by these Humans.

Eventually, they either felt they had exhausted what answers I could give, or that I might perhaps need a break. I am not sure which, and likely never will know. But they brought through more of my people, having apparently convinced the bandits to lay down their arms, and I got to take a break. I headed for bed that night in a way I hadn’t in years: surrounded by the sounds of running machinery. It was the best night’s sleep I have ever had in my life, no matter how loud the machines, for you could not imagine the relief their presence brought.

But there was one last thing I had done that day. Those who had found me had quickly discovered the bodies of the soldiers that had died at the airbase, and brought them out (I later found out my steedbeast had been sniffing around the bodies, and had given the soldiers quite the shock). Before sending me to rest, the Humans asked how they would best prepare the bodies, a rather complicated question that had involved a great back and forth involving many pictures of their own dead being disposed of in various ways before I understood it.

And so, I oversaw my last funeral. I watched, as the Humans hand-dug a fresh grave, and, with the utmost care and ceremony, even as transports continued to land and vehicles raced around in the chaos and confusion of that day, laid 20 more of my species to rest.

239,676.

---

What came next is what every one of us knows: the dramatic reversal of fortunes. We were not magically saved overnight, of course: the Humans could not bring us new food, new medicine and so on, because our biologies were incompatible. But they could bring us new tractors, new factories, new trucks and planes and computerised logistics systems, so everything we made could get where it was needed. To spend years engaged in backbreaking subsistence farming, and watch as a Human descends in a combine harvester larger than the shack you sleep in… only our species can imagine how life changing that is.

It took us a year to end the famines and plagues. In 2, we were back to growing as a species. In 3, our planet was united under a single government, elected rather than the succession of emergency governments we had lived with after the Fall. Their first act was to immediately apply for full membership of the United Nations, and it was granted without delay.

It has been 30 years since that glorious day, and the news ever since has been awash with reports of a great many firsts. First Eikran to crew a UN Pioneers vessel. First of the ruined cities to be declared safe for resettlement. First Eikran-built spaceship since the Fall.

There are some, in our species, who argue that things have gone wrong. That we would have been best off had the Humans simply arrived, helped, and gone home immediately after we were back on our feet. That, in some way, we have become slaves to the United Nations. It’s tempting to dismiss them by pointing out that if we tried that, the UN would probably still be here for decades to come, depending on how you define ‘back on our feet’. But that misses the real problem.

We destroyed our planet, and very nearly ourselves. The United Nations did not merely *save* us, they showed us what we *could* have been had things gone a different way. They never asked a thing of us, have never demanded or even politely requested a single resource. Our system has not become a hub for their weapons, our people have not been forcibly taken into their armies and navies, our cities have not become their homes. They landed because it was the right thing to do, to help us, and would have turned around and left the moment we asked.

Do you know what they call our world? Renhai. A Human word, meaning multitude. They came to a dying planet and saw only what it *could* be, and did everything to ensure it.

Now, we stand at the gateway to the stars. Some day, it may be an Eikran aboard a ship descending to a people in need. It may be an Eikran platoon descending into a flooded city to recover an old family heirloom for a small family of aliens in a village. And it may be Eikran voting to approve an application to join the United Nations. Is it not the least we could do, to say that we will aid in extending The Great Favour? A recognition that none should ever fear not receiving aid?

Regardless, I am simply happy the number will never reach 239,677.

Throwaway because he follows my main. I'm 23F, boyfriend ""Alex"" is 25M. We've been together for almost 3 years, living together for 1.

Cooking has been my passion since I was little. My family's from Italy—my Nonna taught me everything, from handmade pasta to sauces that take all day. It's not just recipes; it's how we bond, share stories, celebrate. I even started a small side gig selling homemade sauces at local markets while I finish my degree. Alex has always acted supportive—he'll wash dishes after I cook, post pics of my meals on his Insta, even helped me set up my market booth once. But early on, he mentioned having nut and dairy ""sensitivities"" (not full allergies, but they make him feel off). So I've tweaked all our meals: almond-free everything, vegan cheeses, oat milk in the coffee. It was a hassle sourcing stuff on a student budget, but I did it because I cared.

This all blew up last weekend at my family's Sunday dinner. I was helping in the kitchen, and Alex said he had to run out for ""work emails"" (he works remote). My little cousin spotted him at the gelato shop down the street, demolishing a cone loaded with pistachios and real cream. She snapped a pic and showed the family group chat, laughing about it. I confronted him later, and after dodging, he confessed he's been faking it the whole time. Reason? He ""doesn't love"" the rich Italian stuff—too heavy for him—and thought lying was kinder than saying so. He's been grabbing fast food burgers and pizza on his ""errands"" for years, ditching the lunches I pack.

I was devastated. It's not the preferences; I get that. But the constant lying? Me stressing over labels, spending extra on alternatives, feeling guilty when he'd ""react"" to something I missed? He knows this is my heritage—I've talked about teaching our future kids (we've discussed marriage)—and it feels like he's been dismissing it sneakily. I told him it was like rejecting who I am, and he just sighed, saying I'm overreacting and ""it's only food, babe.""

I've been crashing at my bestie's since, blocked him everywhere, and I'm packing my stuff from our place. My roommate from college thinks I'm being too harsh, that white lies happen in relationships and we could work through it.

1nt0e4c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nt0e4c,I was recently involved in a PMD restoration project to restore some former PMD to a 2019 Lincoln cent.,"So as everyone knows, I’m not a doctor, but I do love PMD. Today I want to show you a recent project I acquired some time ago last Tuesday. Got my usual box of pennies out to hunt down those choice dryer coins. A couple of rolls in and I come across something to get REAL excited about. When you see the jagged metal poking through the paper, the shiny zinc peeking through and the smell of PMD is in the air, this is what I live for!

I quickly unroll it and lay to roll open. I pull it out and it’s amazing. Almost like someone’s wadded up used toilet paper after a proper morning coffee break. My heart was pounding and hands sweating. I put the coin down to get the gloves on. I looked it over carefully and could see that the metal had been precisely galled and folded very neatly. So I wanted to unfold it and restore the PMD to its former glory.

Well, I wanted too. Halfway through the restoration the project hit a snag when the MF (main flake is what I called it) started to tear under the work hardening stress of being unfolded. I was able to get it into a position that best represents what it would have looked like shortly after the BB (big bang, but not the big one this one would have been much smaller). That’s the best I could do.  Maybe one day I’ll break out the blow torch and anneal the copper and straighten it out proper to frame it, but the weekend is almost over and that’s for another time.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I live on the fourth floor of an apartment building. It's relatively small but perfect for someone who lives alone. There is one room, one bathroom and it comes with an open kitchen. It's perfect and I've been living here for about a year, close to two.

I work from home so I don't tend to have much of a reason to go out, unless it's to keep sane and socialize with the outside world. I started working from home a couple months back and it's been great. I choose when to work and when to take breaks as long as I stay within the hours I'm supposed to work a day. It's a good job and I make enough to live. These days though my sleep schedule has been extremely off. I can almost sleep through the whole day and so I work mostly during the night. I've been trying to fix that mostly by staying up all night and day and going to bed at a normal time. 

The way my horrible sleep schedule started was on one particularly hot night. I kept tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep properly. The night was hot and humid, the blanket heavy, the bed uncomfortable, and the fan, loud and in my ears, only pushed the hot air around the room. I'd turn, flipping my pillow to the other side, the temperature the same on both sides. I wonder who cursed me that night. I wouldn't be surprised if I couldn't find my glasses that morning. 

So with a sigh I got up and went to my desk deciding to stay up for the rest of the night. Bringing the fan with me, I placed it down next to me as I took my seat. My glasses, still off, my phone now on, I scrolled mindlessly to pass the time. What felt like five minutes passed when out of the corner of my eye something blurry was on my lap. 

Grey and crawling on me I slapped it away.  I threw on my glasses and looked to the floor to see if it was there.  Nothing.  A shiver ran through me. probably wasn't enough to kill it so it ran off under something, my dresser, maybe the piles of clothes or random boxes I had on the floor.

 I got up taking minimal steps to my bed, deciding to just shrug off what happened, but it felt like it was still on me. Crawling up my legs to my thighs.  little legs, itching, and biting me. I'd rub my legs scratching at them to get the feeling off. It only multiplied though, on my feet between my toes, up my ankles to the calves, up to my thighs. I knew nothing was there, so after some moments of unrelenting scratching and picking, I'd stop and focus on something else to get my mind off the uncomfortable sensation. I was tired and hot, and sweating like crazy.  So maybe that's what magnified that situation so much.

I didn't sleep the rest of the night and stayed up till the morning. I decided to start my day at five with a cup of coffee forgetting everything that happened, except now with my glasses on I'd see them. crawling about like they owned the place. 

I was at my desk working and on the floor Silverfish, on the bigger side, would be freely crawling around. Multiple of them. To the point that I couldn't just ignore them, I'd have to kill a few. And god I hate killing those things.  The feeling of it squishing under my hand with a thin tissue separating us made me gag in disgust.  But the more I killed, the more I'd see them. I only saw about five of them at a time, but they moved around so much that it felt as though a lot more were hiding in my room. 

I had to ignore them. So I chose to just focus on my work, keeping my eyes on my computer. When lunch rolled around nothing was there, zero bugs crawled around the floor of my room.

When I came back from lunch, they got bolder, moving around closer to me, crawling up my chair. That's when I decided to pack up my things and move to the living room away from those disgusting things. 

I still decided to sleep in my bed that night. Luckily, the silverfish only stayed in the office area of my room, going nowhere near my bed. I felt safe in my bed like I already knew that they wouldn't be able to touch me there. 

I steer clear of that area now. working in the living room, sleeping in my bed, eating in the kitchen. If I need anything in that area I go over avoiding the multiplying bugs, getting what I need and not going back. 

It's not hard. I just ignore it. Sometimes I look over, accidentally making eye contact with one of those little things.

As a homeowner who constantly grapples with ensuring water quality, this product came across as not just necessary but highly efficient in its design and performance. This reverse osmosis system replacement filter set promises a lot, and over several months of usage, I’ve seen it live up to many of those promises. However, there’s always room for balance when it comes to these reviews, so let me share the details.

**Easy Installation and Versatile Compatibility**  
The first thing I noticed about the system was how user-friendly the installation process turned out to be. Armed with just a basic understanding of plumbing and the clear instructions provided, I had the filters swapped out and running in under an hour. I appreciated the compatibility with industry-standard 10-inch filter housings and 12-inch membrane housings. This means it works across a variety of setups, from residential ones like mine to RVs and industrial spaces. For anyone who’s been concerned about the fit, this filter covers a wide range. 

[Check Express Water FLTSETS6C6G6I3M502 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b01lr8312w/)  

**Performance and Purification Quality**  
The marketing materials boast of filtering out 99.99% of impurities, and while I obviously didn’t run a lab test, I can genuinely say the improvement in water quality is noticeable. From eliminating odd odors to enhancing taste, it even had my morning coffee tasting better. The system is engineered to remove impurities like chlorine, lead, microplastics, fluoride, and other contaminants that would typically trouble your reverse osmosis system or even your health. Compared to the soggy faucet filters I’ve used in the past, this felt like a luxurious upgrade!

**Durability and Design Construction**  
Durability is often a concern when you’re shelling out for filtration systems, and this kit didn’t disappoint. The solid design of the filters—crafted with materials like polypropylene and coconut shell carbon—gave me confidence that these weren’t disposable quality. Over several months of use, I haven’t noticed any significant drop in performance, and I like that each part is made of 100% food-grade materials. At just under 20 pounds for the full set, the filters feel robust in hand rather than flimsy. Also, Express Water seems to understand—clean water isn’t just a beverage; it’s peace of mind.  

**Highlights**  
Based on my extended use, some of the standout points of the product include:  
- Highly efficient filtration, providing cleaner and better-tasting water.  
- Compatible with all standard 10-inch filter housings and 12-inch membrane housings.  
- Long-lasting filters with added value in the 3-year set.  
- Durable materials that inspire trust.  

**Shortcomings**  
Of course, no product is without its limitations, and this water filtration set is no exception:  
- The replacement process isn’t ideal for beginners without instructions or prior plumbing knowledge.  
- Filters might struggle if your water pressure falls under the 40-80 PSI standard (a booster pump is recommended but not included).  
- Some installations with non-standard piping might face challenges connecting.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
I’ve looked into rivals like the APEC ROES-50 and iSpring RCC7, and they bring their competitive angles. While the APEC set is known for similar long-lasting filters, it tends to cost slightly more for comparable results. On the other hand, iSpring filters bring some interesting sediment removal capabilities but lack the coconut shell carbon emphasis that’s here. The Express Water version shines in its user-friendliness and compatibility with 10-inch industry-standard parts—where competitors sometimes lock you into proprietary-sized housings.

**Value Proposition**  
Pricing is always an important factor, and thankfully, this system brings solid bang for the buck. While there are cheaper options, the longevity of the filters and the measurable improvement in water quality justify the cost over time. Investing in this system feels like a long-term decision aimed at better health and reduced hassle. The affordability, combined with impressive specifications like the 23-piece 3-year set, ensures you’re not left putting replacements together piecemeal every six months.

I loved you unconditionally, and felt that would never fade. I fear, now, that this is true. 

My life seems to have stopped altogether when you decided to end things. There were many days that started awfully, with a chest pain so severe I thought I was having a heart attack. Where I spent the day crying— Starting privately, before attempting to be around my family— in which the tears flowed freely. There were days in which I disassociated. They were especially frightening. My friends tell me to back out there and meet a girl for a rebound. To call you and let you know how badly I’m hurting, that there is cruelty in leaving someone days before our anniversary together. I see no point in either. 

I just want you to be happy. I struggle to type “even in a future without me”, but I suppose that is true. I feel pity for myself because it is hard to imagine me being happy without you. But, I respect that this is what you want, and am trying to face the world day by day. 

While I do, with every fiber of my being, wish things were different, I just want you to be okay. I want you to get help with your depression. I want you to ride rollercoasters. I want you to laugh and to sing. I want you to smile at the raccoons on the side the rode. I want your cats to feel such joy when they see you that they can’t help but jump onto your bed demanding to be pet. I want each day to begin with a delicious cup of coffee, and only improve from there. 

I will struggle on my end of the world, and it’s probably going to be awhile until I’m “okay”. But, no matter what, I love you and want you to be happy.

1nt064i,https://i.redd.it/oce2p196myrf1.png,Trade goods tier list (explanation for each good below),"A few things before the explanation:

1. This is my (very educated, 1700 hours) opinion and might be more suited to my playstyle.

1. This is pretty general but some trade goods are better in certain situations or with certain playstyles.

1. A baseline price of 3 is considered average.

1. Only looking at permanent price increases/decreases or temporary ones that are long/significant enough.

F tier: Bad goods

Slaves are not worth very much and both the local bonus (1 missionary strength) and trading bonus (25% tariffs) are hot garbage. Tariffs rarely make up much income but drive up liberty desire. While they do get an early price increase, its from 2 to 3, which is from bad to meh. As soon as you can pass abolitionism, do it.

Wool has bad bonuses too and receives 2 price decreases early before getting 2 price increases in the very late game (when money doesn't matter as much). While the trading in bonus (-5% ship costs) is decent, a trade good worth 1.75 for 100 years is hot garbage.

D tier: Subpar goods

Fish has a horrible price that only gets worse, but the sailors it gives make it ok as Navy is pretty important. Also soldier's households!

Chinaware has a decent price of 4.5 for about 100 years but the rest of the game, it is just an average value good (some temporary price increases in a few mission trees but nothing crazy). It also again has mid bonus's (-0.1 autonomy is useless at 0 autonomy, which you should be at anyways for most of the game).

C tier: average goods:

Livestock isn't worth much but only gets permanent price ups. While it doesn't get most of them until pretty late, and the bonus's are meh, the ability to make a very effective soldier household on livestock keeps it here.

Wine is pretty much the same, only price increases (late game tho) and soldier's household makes it decent.

Incense has an end price of 3 after 1600. Only thing keeping it from D is its bonus's, which are pretty decent (trade value always very good, tolerance of true faith also good).

Naval supplies are very underrated, I always see them in the bottom tier on these, but they literally just give you naval force limit (20% bonus for trading in!) they also only get a price increase (late game unfortunately).

Spices are great until 1600, where they fall off a cliff. If you can prevent decline of the spice trade by monopolizing spices or blocking Europeans, they are a good bit better, but I can't put them any higher with the mid bonus's.

Tropical wood gets a price increase to 3 100 years into the game, would be lower but the 5 percent dev from the trading in bonus alone bumps it up, this is very good. The local bonus (-20% construction cost) is meh.

Yemen/England tier

Coffee is B tier if you are Yemen (or Yemen does their mission for 25% price increase ) and C tier otherwise as it has mid bonus's (institution spread does nothing for 90% of the game!) Has a 50% price increase in 1550 but a -40% in 1580's. Base price of 3 saves it.

Tea is B tier if you are England (or England does the parliament thing but good luck getting the AI to do something like that) and C tier otherwise. The trade in bonus of -10% advisor cost is very nice, it gets price increases but isn't amazing until the 50% increase from England.

B tier: good goods (lol)

Furs are very underrated; they are worthless early game but get 2 big increases in 1500 and 1570. The local bonus of 10% province trade power is amazing and the trade in bonus for 0.5 prestige yearly is decent. As Russia, you can definitely skyrocket from these increases as you push east and gain a crap ton.

Grain has a bad price but gives you land force limit (0.5 per province, 20% trade in bonus!) and lets you build good soldier workehouses. The 20% bonus alone makes this way better than some people realize. It can be a bit difficult to get if you are playing tall but even the 0.5 per province is better than most local bonus's.

Salt has a average price with 1 increase but is here because of the local bonus for defensiveness. Setting up 1 mountain fort producing salt with ramparts and a random defensiveness event plus edict gives you a stronghold. The trading bonus is also really nice as it just saves you money (-5% land maintenance modifier).

Sugar has 2 really nice price increases, although they are a ways into the game (150 years and 200 years). Still, it starts out worth 3 and ends up being worth 5.25 which is up there. The bonus's are mid (-1 local unrest, -20% cost of reducing war exhaustion) but the price being high keeps it up here.

Tobacco is similar, has a base price of 3, a nice price 50% increase around 1600, but has a much better local bonus than sugar (+10% province trade power). Trade in bonus is mid.

Iron only gets a price increase but its pretty late in the game (50% in 1622). It has a base price of 3, its local bonus is ok (-20% local const time) and its trade in bonus is very nice (-5% regiment cost). Overall, a solid good.

A tier: Great goods

Cocoa has a base price of 4 (already great) and only gets a 35% increase around 1600. Its bonus's are amazing (+10% local manpower, trade in +5% manpower recovery speed) so it doesn't fit anywhere other than here.

Cotton gets only 2 increases (+20% in 1500, +45% in 1674) and while the second one takes a long time, the local bonus (-10% dev) and the trade in (+20 global settler) catapult cotton up to A tier. Yes the trade in bonus is eventually useless, but when you are still colonizing, its huge and -10% dev is just about the best local bonus you can have. Its just slightly worse cloth.

Ivory has a base of 4 and gets a price increase (1750 tho, way too late to be significant). But its mostly up here because of the trade in bonus. +2 diplomatic reputation is nutty for doing nothing. Local bonus is ok (-20% local state maintenance).

Glass gets 4 price increases (all in 1600's) and 1 giant price decrease (-65% in 1650) but will be worth 3.45 (up from base of 3) after all events. So why is it so high up? 2 reasons. The first is you can build twice as effective state houses on glass (AMAZING). The second is the local bonus (+10% production efficiency) and trade bonus (-5% dip tech cost) are incredibly good. If not for the -65%, would be S tier.

Gems are an early game carry. +25% price increase like 10 years into the game, (base is 4, so this means 5 value trade good in 1450's) and while you do get a -50% in the 1530's, this is still 80 years of value. Local bonus meh (+15% tax) and trade bonus great (+0.05 inflation reduction). Would be B tier but also has 2x effective state house and with early game carry, can't put any lower.

Persia/Sweden tier

Cloth is the best COMMON trade good in the game. Gets 2 decent price increases and local bonus is -10% dev (amazing). Solid A tier but if you are Persia (or if Persia does mission for +35% price), the cost and bonus's easily make this S tier.

Silk is very highly priced with a great local bonus (+2 local trade power) and great trade in bonus (+1 max promoted culture). Even with only the 25% price increase, its A tier but if you are playing as Persia, arguably S or above tier. You get a 25% price increase that’s permanent in their mission tree and a temporary 150% increase for 40 years! Byzantium also gets a 20% permanent price increase in their missions but tough to get both in single player. Overall, silk has a theoretical max price of 7.5 and even without the Byzantium mission, 6.7 is still an insane max price.

Dyes are similar to the last 2, in A tier for sure, S tier if Persia (+50% permanent price increase in their mission!). Price changes are a bit late but base price of 4 and good bonus's (+10% province trade and +33% chance of heir) make it still pretty good before price changes. If Persia, worth 6!

Copper gets a sweet +50% price increase very early and doesn't get a decrease until 1620's. Recruitment time bonus's are meh but price is good for a long time and if Sweden, 40 year +150% price increase! combined with the monument, S tier for sweden but still pretty good for all others as price decrease is quite late, so still A assuming sweden doesn't pop their mission.

S tier: best of the best

Cloves are just worth a lot. Simple as that. Being worth 8 all game no matter what gets you in S tier. But if that wasn't enough, you get a local trade bonus and trade in trade bonus for cloves!? If you are ever expanding in indonesia and you don't grab cloves, you are missing out on hundreds of ducats just from the 5 or so clove provinces that will exist. Also very easy to get trade in bonus as if you own 1 of those clove provinces, you probably own the others too.

Paper is worth a good amount, gets 2 earlyish price increases, 2 later increases and 1 -50% price decrease in 1650. Even with that massive hit, it should still be worth 5.77 until the price decrease, and 5.25 after 1700. But paper isn't up here because of price alone, its here because of its bonus's and potential for a 2x effective state house. -5% admin tech cost is amazing (any power points saved from trade goods are the best bonus's) and the local -10% state maintenance is pretty good. Overall, the best of the 3 state house goods (paper, glass, gems)

Gold tier

Gold is a bit different from the others as it doesn't produce trade and has no bonus's. You also don't have production efficiency effect it. Gold is simply a province that produces pure ducats. It's this high because it can allow you to take on nations much bigger than you early game. Gold income does become a bit inconsequential later, but its early game carrying is enough to put it here as the second best trade good in the game.

SSS tier: coal

I know a lot of people hardly ever play with coal because who plays to 1700? But assuming you do play until then and still have challenging opponents, coal is like putting your economy on crack. Its worth 10 at first (most in the game) and receives a -30% price after a while. But coal could be worth 2 and would still be the best for 1 reason alone: furnaces. They give you a +5% goods produced GLOBALLY. Oh you are playing as Poland and have 10 coal provinces? +50% goods produced! (and 10 provinces with good value). If this wasn't enough, the trade in bonus is another 10% goods produced! If you are ever planning to go into the late game, conquering future coal provinces is a must do.",18,1759094790.0,eu4,2,0.92,False

In this post, we’ll be tackling Shinji Hirako.  You know him, don’t ya? Blond-haired, toothy dude. Likes jazz. Has a tongue piercing. Loses via talking method… well, that was uncalled for.  I do love Shinji a great deal.

His fashion sense is quite iconic and has made statements over the years. But as for his design itself, it holds many elements as to why he is popular as it is. Kubo designs him carefully too, and there’s many sides to it that I’d love for you to know.

There will be a ton of visuals in this post! They’re made by me to cover up for the fact that I perhaps write more than I should. [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/1h3auek/a_detailed_analysis_of_kubos_character_design/) of this little series covers Lille, Starrk and many other characters. [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/1jdap6t/analyzing_character_designs_byakuya_and_rangiku/) is Byakuya and Rangiku.

**Note: this will be ridiculously long.**

We have a lot to cover with both his presentation and design. Shinji has a gentlemanly set of clothing choices, from ties and newsboy caps to long coats. His frame is quite thin, so longer clothes practically hang off him, but the close-cut ones still emphasize his stature.

Let’s first tackle a concept crucial to Shinji’s design- the *vertical line*.

•────⋅☾ ☽⋅─────••─────⋅☾ ☽⋅─────•

# Staccato, Legato and Movement

In talking about the vertical line, I also want to mention other concepts that will be useful.

If you know a bit of music theory, you’ll be familiar with the terms ‘**staccato**’ and ‘**legato**’. In short: staccato refers to notes that are *quick and short*, briskly played. The opposite is legato, where the notes are all *connected and fluid*.

The idea with staccato is interest. For legato, it is smoothness.

Now if you take the concept into fashion and character design, it works in the same way. A key part of design is the idea of **lines**. Just as notes can be played in staccato and legato, the lines can remain clean and smooth, or they can be broken to create contrast.

**Incorporating different kinds of lines is how you retain a fashionable look, drawing attention to or even away from certain focal points.**

https://preview.redd.it/w7sflixy1zrf1.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=80ba2453171f4df6b9ce11b672c1398c01df37a8

As you can notice with the lines on the visual above, our eyes travel along the colours as they flow. Tensa Zangetsu & White have cleaner lines, where it remains simple and unbroken, moving along a line from top to bottom with ease.

Tatsuki and Orihime however, break the visual line by wearing pops of colour.  Orihime’s top and skirt are two different shades of pink, while her cardigan is peach. Her shoes are brown, mirroring the colour on Tatsuki’s cap. Tatsuki herself wears a purple top with green pants and red shoes.

There is no real winner in broken versus unbroken lines. It is entirely dependent on the intention of the art and the medium of expression. Where visual interest is concerned, staccato can be used. Where smoothness is required, then legato.  

**How exactly do you break a line?**

**You can give varying textures to clothing, use different colours, accessorize well, repeat or add elements across outfits (patterns, clothing types, colours), and pick different fits (ex: a top that highlights character’s muscles versus flared pants – distinctive areas of attention and accentuation).**

Now let’s get into the main point with Shinji. *Kubo portrays him in a clear vertical line- but there are very intentional breaks in between to give him more flair.*

https://preview.redd.it/cxbsbs002zrf1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=456398f4cc6f5b7cffa7ab9accc13e6fc562b6d1

His yellow shirt and black pant combo is iconic, but one of the reasons it works so well is because of his design itself (which others characters would struggle to pull off).

There are two repeating colours: black and yellow. It begins from his hair, all the way down to his dark green shoes. We have the top half of his look being dominated by a light shade (yellow), and the lower half taking on dark shades (black and green). But the colour break is white, which is the belt.

His teeth are pearly white too, but I don't want to sound like a toothpaste advertisement. But **the idea of preserving vertical is kept constant by repeating elements and colours**\*.\* Thus, the lines become visually elongated.

We know he is tall- but even more, we know he is thin. The legs take up a majority of his frame, but there’s enough length for his upper body to remind of his stature. His close-cut outfits stick to his skin (hence, we know he is thin), while the looser captain's haori overwhelms his figure (again, we feel he is thin because it’s loose and hangs off him).

The white element acts as the horizontal line break (belt, *maybe* mirroring his teeth). The yellow hair and shirt match. And both the pants and tie are black, and his shoes are a dark green. So there's a sort of continuous flow to the outfit visually in how the colours all come together. That is why it works so well.

Another reason why is an element in art called **visual movement**. While it is more associated with using colours, textures and shapes to draw attention to a focal point, I'd like to touch on how Kubo uses it in his designs and panels to bring liveliness to his character designs.

https://preview.redd.it/t98eynw02zrf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5d0f34445e593967818454cc309dfb86f4e59f8

Certain characters have more *visual flow* than others.

For example, Unohana’s maternal look has a composed feel, fittingly so, as someone who doesn’t engage in combat. But her haori still flows in the wind, and as the curved shape of *Minazuki* breaks the visual ‘straightness’ that her straight-down braided hair brings her.

With her hair down in her return to her role as Kenpachi, there’s always a flowing element as she moves in combat, her hair and coat always in motion. The brutality is all there in how she fights... but it is very graceful all the same in the way she swivels about.

**Shinji’s hair and tie have some visual flow/movement, contributing to a smooth line from top to bottom of the design**. We are always made aware of his thinness, especially the way Kubo always draws his figure from different angles.

In his Arrancar arc fit, there is some visual flow with his tie and hair despite the outfit being cut-close to his figure. It avoids the more ‘packed’ feel we get from buff characters like Kensei or Ginjo due to their regular looks feeling more grounded.

The chest is interesting to think about in connection to the vertical line (*I am strictly talking design and nothing else for those who are concerned*😉), since a broader chest brings an outward movement from the eyes. Instead of focusing on the vertical, our eyes move outward.

As for his captain cloak, it already adds a great deal of that flow for most characters, even characters like Byakuya and Toshiro (who have some rigid elements in their designs, like the former's kenseikan and the latter's icy hair).

Let us go into more solid design elements, shall we?

•────⋅☾ ☽⋅─────••─────⋅☾ ☽⋅─────•

# Shinji Hirako: The Inversion

[Fun fact: This was supposed to be the very first visual.](https://preview.redd.it/5rl6ffo12zrf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=236e78f835843003bb530d6c70790f39798faf58)

He has a lot going on visually. Firstly, the blond and uneven hair. It's meant to give off the impression of eccentricity. Textbook villainous jerk. His teeth are also straight and often shown, which again adds to that.

Everything in his design is narrow. His eyes stretch narrowly, his hair is thinly layered, his body is stick-thin and his clothes are close-fitting. But when he adopts his '*British Gentleman*' look later on, he becomes more appealing, because we now know he isn't a villain (since he starts helping Ichigo).

His design is also impacted by Kubo's change in style, as a character appearing from the start of the Arrancar arc, where a notable shift takes place in the art. What started off as sharper cuts and slightly more jagged edges, gained a lot of refinement as the arcs progressed, carrying into Fullbring and TYBW.

Shinji's hair is a visual marker for his character, so we'll tackle that first.

https://preview.redd.it/072po9w32zrf1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5a1f4487611c283158520938642dcafaf28ee5e

This is very important for you to know, as per Kubo himself: Shinji has naturally smooth hair. If you were wondering what kind of shampoo he uses, there’s your answer. He is simply blessed with sleek and luscious hair that requires no treatment.

Kubo is such a troll😅

A core part of Shinji’s character is his sense of style (since it ties into the theme of self-expression, much like his love for jazz). We also know from Kubo that **he cut his long hair in order to keep up with the times and match his more contemporary outfits**.

It is another character inflection here, but Shinji does inherently like to keep up with modern trends and ideas… but at the same time, he is incredibly impacted and influenced by his past.

Yes, he changes his clothes. And his hair is different. But *he carries the same self that he was from back then, and there’s a disillusionment that goes unnoticed underneath his more flamboyant side*. Not that any of that isn’t genuine. He embodies both and learns to come to terms with it later (and having Momo and the Vizards was a part of his healing process).

Notably, he doesn’t have Yumichika’s ideology of appearing beautiful and being offended if he isn’t considered as such, he simply likes to express himself the way he wants. Whether that impresses or puts off people isn’t really his concern.

Away from deep character tidbits and on to hair and styling (I’m joking, you will be getting both)!

Shinji has uneven blond hair. It is a *blunt-cut hairstyle*, meaning that the hair is cut across in a straight line, no layering or softer edges. A crisp cut with all the hair in a similar length. The opposite of characters like Rangiku and Jugram (who have more layers in their blond tresses).

**Asymmetry** is also something Shinji incorporates well in his hair as time passes, with his fringe getting more uneven post-Arrancar.

In the past, his hair is quite long and luscious. There is a bit more flow to the hair due to it's length. After being reinstated to the Gotei 13, both him and Momo change their hairstyles (post-Aizen effect, as a way of moving on). His future look keeps the uneven fringe.

I wonder who his barber is. Does he cut his own hair?

https://preview.redd.it/3iu5ycg42zrf1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb12092df1e77e92766de24bd04627905eb503a

**Eyes are perhaps one of the most beautiful parts of Bleach**. They reveal characters in a way that their words cannot; while words can create an impression, it can be discerned of its truthfulness by the eyes.

Unohana has a combination of both her narrowed and softer gaze at the end of her duel (symbolizing the integration of the healer and fighter), Jugram's stoicism is betrayed by his softer eyes, Byakuya's grey set gives away a lot of grief and thoughtfulness, while Aizen's closeups are weary and melancholic.

Shinji is not an outlier in the theme of eyes and honesty. His gaze is weary, surprisingly serious and focused in comparison to the wide smiles we see in panels. There is a lot of exhaustion in his narrow gaze as well. There is a melancholy to it that feels different from Aizen and Kisuke in their closeups.

I should have mentioned this first, but his eye colour is *brown*. Interestingly, there's a pattern of brown eyes all coming from this squad (Aizen, Shinji, Momo... and even the OG Captain!).

While I'd argue the eyes are a huge part of characterization, the case is doubled down when it comes to Shinji and Aizen specifically... because *their whole deal involves illusions/hypnosis, dragging people into a world where you are under their control*.

It is a heavier idea for Aizen, whose set of abilities require people to see the release of his blade to begin with (which connects him even more to Tosen and Gin in the 'sight' theme). But it also involves perception and sensation, which heavily factors Shinji.

•────⋅☾ ☽⋅─────••─────⋅☾ ☽⋅─────•

# Style

https://preview.redd.it/1jo5nc072zrf1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=76d63f00b8ed5c1c9f26a2c989c54d5551e16be0

For Shinji's normal sense of fashion, he is mostly seen with shirts and ties, formal pants and even jeans. His appearances all throughout Arrancar reinforce that preference for close-cut outfits, ones that aren't pulled tight but still stay close to the skin.

There are distinct ties to **British-mod styles** from the 60s, with the coats and collared shirts. Colours in the era were bright, taking inspiration from the Ivy League style (an earlier version of the 'preppy' aesthetic).

*Skinny ties* were incorporated into several looks, usually in black. *Newsboy caps* were also quite a thing back then (Shinji's signature cap), as well as *narrow trousers*. Clothing was well-tailored with crisp cuts and defined outlines.

Mod-style is influenced by many cultures, from Italian and Spanish styles to Hispanic and black culture. The idea was to escape the daily hum-drum by exploring and assimilating foreign elements to their style and as an aesthetic choice to live by. It started with England but became a buzz in the US and abroad.

Jazz is also associated with this era, since youths frequented jazz clubs. They also began to adopt foreign elements into their look, hence earning the title as *Modernists-* or **mods**. It aesthetically fits Shinji quite well, especially the theme of an evolving style.

https://preview.redd.it/myb5qak72zrf1.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9ca90c9fdcd30f0c7dd1469122715d58019a95d

Kubo is quite intentional in how he draws Shinji, as a character who is particular about his clothing choices. He is the only one among the Visoreds who has a constant outfit change, even in artworks. The rest stick to their regular looks (they are still great designs!).

It's also interesting that the **Visoreds all have some form of white somewhere in their design**. I mean, you could say that for nearly every character, but there is a sort of tie-in to white at every turn.

Shinji's belt is white, Rose/Hiyori/Hachi all have inner white vests or shirts, Lisa has a white top, Mashiro's armour is white. Kensei's hair is white (his vest takes on a white lining later), and Love has a white accessory (line?) across his outfit. Their colours are all distinct; but there is a common thread.

I cannot believe I didn't notice that Shinji had a clip on his tie till now. I thought I was being smart😂

https://preview.redd.it/s7jb9k792zrf1.png?width=1637&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb86bdfcb6aa9af03aa4939c420069d4355fae1

Shinji cannot help but add his personal flair to everything. He achieves his distinctive look with his accessories.

The collars usually have a tie. Shirts are layered with coats and pullovers. He even opts for a gold chain necklace in his Cour 2 Opening. And a tongue piercing.

It's a change from the more classically Japanese aesthetic we had seen so far in their story, esp. with the Shinigami in their robes and all the motifs that came with it. His style is more contemporary and snazzy.

The look in the first volume sees him with a black wrist accessory (it has a smiley on it!), and a chain tied to his belt. Hanging from his white belt in his Arrancar look is the strap of his belt, which he tucks to the side rather than bringing it around all the way through the holes.

Shinji wears a lot of collared shirts in official arts- his first volume appearance is in the school's uniform, then there's the yellow shirt with/without the shoulder design, and his grey coat when fighting Grimmjow.

This isn't for every character, but *closing off the neck visually holds meaning.* It was used in Soi-Fon's Cour 2 opening look too. But the idea is that **there is something that is hidden, something the character holds close** (it could be anything); the overall vibe is being 'closed' off. Not every case of course, but it is in some cases.

Shinji almost always chooses looks that reach up to his neck or cover it in some fashion. That includes wearing collars, ties, cravats and turtlenecks. But in the flashbacks, he didn't have it any measure. So that means he adopts the look as a little fashion quirk... but that still reflects a part of him in some measure, how he approaches the world (mistrust).

The current look incorporates a yellow wrap around his neck, pinned together with a pastel purplish clip, which has a little pink detail. Again, the colours are relevant (Momo has pink/red for her primary colours, and Aizen's purple pops up a lot for Shinji).

His Fullbring look adds a white *cravat* tucked under the shirt and a white knotted sash. A new robe is under his captain’s haori but over the shihakusho, pinned at the front. If you're wondering what a cravat is, in America, you'd call it as an **ascot** (think of Fred Jones' tie from Scooby Doo).

His shoes are green, his socks are also depicted as green in the look below. Though Kubo has placed him in black dress shoes before. As a Shinigami, he wears the regular tabi socks with waraji (footwear).

**V**

https://preview.redd.it/9wvpob5a2zrf1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=e71ad8b871cc351257f5e472054446d4d1890196

This is a favourite cover of mine, I absolutely love the amount of details thrown in. It feels so cozy!

His sweater is a muted shade of yellow (an obvious nod to his design), combined with a pale-coloured shirt and pants. The tie is orange, much like the inner material of the trousers. His socks and headphones are both green. Most of the colours in his look repeat somewhere in the environment, creating a connection between the disparate elements.

I mentioned all the colours straight up, since we'll be covering more details on how it all ties together.

Shinji is wearing a V-neck sweater (ideal for layering over a shirt and elongating the torso), with ribbing at the neck, cuffs and hem. The neckline for the sweater is much deeper, allowing for the tie to pop out a bit better.

The inner material of the trouser is plaid (more English references!). Soi-Fon also wore plaid in the Cour 2 opening. It's something that leans into a relaxed/polished feel, with Shinji opting for the colour to be orange. The checkered pattern pops up on his tie as well.

I won't bore you with details on if it's *tattersall plaid* or the *tartan plaid*, but orange may be a reference to Ichigo, who is notably someone Shinji looks up to. Kubo has a habit of doing that (ex: Rangiku's Cour 2 OP fit featured a snake-shaped ring, a reference to Gin).

What is cool is how both the shirt and trousers get more '*interest*' to showcase Shinji's sense of style.

The sleeves on one side are rolled up for *both* the shirt and the sweater, allowing us to not only to notice the actual shirt underneath (since our eyes will be drawn to the colour of the shirt as well), but also showcase his bangle.

As for the other arm, it is fully covered with his sleeve. But has a ring to compensate for its 'simplicity' in lacking heavy detail.

His legs are crossed, and one leg is out of view. Thus, we can see the green sock on the crossed leg, since it isn't out of view. *If you posed him with his outstretched legs, we wouldn't see either foot*. But since Shinji crosses one leg, we are able to see the sock and know it's on the other foot as well.

The crossed leg gets a cuffed hem, so we get to see the inner material of the trouser (the plaid).

Shinji here is wearing a red ring on his middle finger. He also has a gold bangle on his wrist (again, emphasis on accessories). Shinji is tied to gold a ton (and regality, pretty Pharoah-esque), sporting a gold chain necklace in his Cour 2 OP look, as well as being cocooned into a gold lotus in his bankai.

Many details are in the surroundings which give so much life to it- the coffee mug with a spoon in it, the looped wire, the fairly organized library contrasting the mild chaos outside, the edge/railing on the right with orange/green to connect to the rest of the work... just brilliant.

Notably, we do not see Shinji's eyes during this spread- something common to Kisuke, who usually shrouds them beneath his hat; symbolic of closing oneself off from something (esp. considering the eyes as the most honest part of a character). It is more closure for Kisuke, but it holds stylistic value for Shinji's characterization too.

Of course, you know he's listening to something absolutely fantastic with those headphones.

https://preview.redd.it/c1ak9vsc2zrf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6200a986808438ea164894a76a88b4728d588be

*Note: I will try and keep this short, this section is LONG.*

The above two visuals have quiet references to Shinji's nature as hybrid of Shinigami and Hollow. You're probably wondering how.

Did you notice the colours in the coat look? Black, white and grey. All incredibly neutral colours of course. Not much of a colour pop and unlike himself. But it represents his makeup as one of the Visored (ahem... I must mention this is a supposed symbolism). **He also fights in this style particularly to show Ichigo his hollow side**.

Black is characteristic of the Shinigami (his shirt), the white as a hollow (his tie and pants are white). However, the coat he puts over it all is grey, a blend of both black and white. The mask is... a mask, he is not a total hollow. But he isn't a complete Shinigami without his mask either. Hence the grey in combo with the black and white.

As for the second, it isn't just a reference to Shinji being a hollow in it's entirety. But the idea of it being tied to godhood, hence the title: **Tug Your God Out**.

The meaning in the lore is to drag the hollow out of Ichigo, but the fact that is associated with being a 'god' is interesting- and **Shinji is the receiver of Aizen's speech about being a god in Fake Karakura Town**. Which means that it does connect to a transcendence (reminder that this is not power-scaling), in being above and beyond the nature of the ordinary.

# Flashback Portrayal

https://preview.redd.it/hb5w4q2f2zrf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3823e45078469ec6b83fa6e2ef2e8f4a69953217

There's a lot going on in Turn Back the Pendulum, a lot that explains Shinji as a character. But I'll hold my tongue (my keyboard, I mean).

In terms of design, **Shinji is a little... less individualistic in his fashion choice during this era**. It makes sense too, since he is still 'young', so to speak, and his sense of style isn't as developed (it was his exposure to the World of the Living that truly allowed him external perspectives). He wears the regular shihakusho in tandem with the white haori.

*Not to say he wasn't individualistic*. He liked jazz, something that is creative and even chaotic in nature. Which Aizen didn't understand (as someone pointed out wonderfully, Aizen is incredibly put at unease by lack of control overall, so he doesn't really understand jazz).

The other thing he has going for him is his longer hair, which is what gives him away from coming from this time. Much like Shunsui and Ukitake with their long hair, Shinji also has the same feel, blending in well with the rest of the group. Rose has long blond hair too, as well as Yoruichi and Unohana.

While he looks beautiful with long hair, there's a part of Shinji that doesn't feel right without the blunt-cut hairstyle. Not just because of our familiarity with that look, but also how key his visual presentation is to his characterization.

In looking at his flashback appearance, you don't think '*mysterious jerk*' right away. Or '*shady guy with unsavoury intent*'. There's a lot more, and you can even tell there is a regal quality to him. Again, that reflects in his hollow mask (as well as his advice to Kisuke).

https://preview.redd.it/4a6u48ge2zrf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfeb4e381185e3d346a07665ee100120fca45a9a

During the flashback, we get a more reflective version of Shinji. He is still eccentric, but still complies with events and is prone to making comments. **Underneath all the strangeness is someone who does see through people quite well**, and is caring. Something we know at this point is untrue for Aizen.

Shinji comes across as brutally honest, commenting on several things that inform us about the time period (the Tenth Kenpachi, the inauguration). There is a different kind of burden that he carries, and it reflects in his leadership role.

It's also important to note that *there was never much innocence in how Shinji was portrayed*. He always seemed to be relaxed but keen. A part of himself that is alert and intuitive, always ready for something. But there is a quick slip for a panel or two.

As he hears Aizen's voice, you can see the vulnerable look in his eyes, something we rarely ever see from Shinji (I put it up there with his angered expression at Hiyori's bisection). He quickly switches from that look, unwilling to let Aizen have control as he reveals himself- and his face twists in anger and realization.

There's an underlying frustration that runs throughout Shinji's arc. It comes from mistrust as well as his own nature, and Aizen reinforced that part of him even more. However, it becomes a point of growth.

I'll touch on Aizen as well. People overlook a small tidbit in their forest interaction, the idea that **Aizen may have genuinely wanted Shinji to see through him**. But he doesn't, as referenced by his little iconic callback (""*since you were in your mother's womb*"").

But why? As Ichigo points out post-battle, Aizen genuinely did want to connect with people. But he can't detach himself from the bonds he created. So he tries to forcibly sever them because they do not match his 'ideal' as a godlike being. But it hurts, because he wanted someone to understand him at his level.

*Aizen still held Shinji to a standard*, had some expectations for him. That's why he directed the trust speech at Shinji, explaining what it meant to be a 'god'. Kind of like he wants *him specifically* to admit it.

You see, Shinji wanted to believe he was somehow responsible for it all, like he somehow could impact and even change Aizen (CFYOW lore: *Sakanade* was very interested in Aizen, and Shinji was interesting in the kind of person Aizen really was). It's the same brand of arrogance as his lieutenant. They see a lot of themselves in each other but refuse to admit it, hence, it hinders a real connection from forming.

This is where we come to the next part.

# Characterization

I admit, this is where I wanted to expand the most, since I absolutely adore stories and theming, but I'll try and not go on tangents.

Shinji and Kisuke both guided Ichigo on his journey to rediscovery, and they both provided an entry for him to his inner world. In the case of Kisuke, Ichigo learned the name of his blade, the very essence of being a Shinigami. With Shinji, he learns to better integrate White, the other part of himself.

It's important to note how those two characters have a lot of care for Ichigo in different ways, and how deeply impacted they were by Aizen's actions towards them. They seem somewhat similar on the surface, but are actually a great deal different.

Kisuke's characterization in the story follows an interesting deviation from the classical scientist type, while Shinji takes on a **relaxed but fairly critical worldview**. You could say he is a creative type at heart, but he is also deeply intuitive and aware of people and systems on a deeper level... to the point that it overwhelms and frustrates him.

While Kisuke and Shinji are both seemingly lax, Kisuke's intellect is made an point of prominence in the story- but for Shinji, while he is smart and witty, falls closer into having sharp intuition. They also seem different in their brand of 'relaxed', with Kisuke putting on the appearance of being a chill shopkeeper and Shinji as an unbothered lover of jazz who is aware of cultural trends.

Shunsui also comes into play here for his more relaxed nature, but again, the trope differs, as he proves to be ruthless in combat, not holding on to pride in keeping a moral high ground. He sticks to drinking a lot more, something which neither Shinji or Kisuke share (but Rangiku does! But is also serves other other purposes for her character).

One of the key distinctive traits that make Shinji stand out is **eccentricity**.

https://preview.redd.it/7hp0gowi2zrf1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1bbc7b423c7c89d1259444020476c051707424f

In his presentation, Shinji is frequently seen raising his shoulders, his hands in his pockets or on his hips, a toothy grin plastered across his face, head tilted, seated learning forward with hands together in the front.

There is a lot of relaxed poise here, but a quiet authority and individuality with it. A lot of finger movements as well (the chapter spread titled 'Hush', with his finger on his lips), or him swinging his zanpakuto. Many crossed legs too, featured in chapter covers.

You get the impression of someone who has odd habits, they way he talks and the way he deals with people, but there's also a quiet mystique to him.

But his eyes are always frequently depicted to be narrowed, focused and weary. It is hard to escape that if you look closely as he talks to Ichigo and Aizen. It is vital to Shinji's character, someone who is deeply frustrated and disillusioned by the world.

Presentation connects to how we perceive the character. Thus, we see Shinji as someone who is quite relaxed, doesn't care much about opinions and is his own person, but is quite caring to people overall. His eyes give more nuance to it, where we see a ton of weariness and mistrust, as well as a dispositional seriousness as situations call for it.

The reversal theme plays so heavily into his character, especially to how we initially perceived him versus what he turned out to be. Funnily enough, that is the exact opposite of how we saw Aizen.

https://preview.redd.it/ngipeuvj2zrf1.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dafc5ce2fe9bf775dbb5cd818881c6dfc5df090

I did have [quite a popular post on Shinji and Aizen](https://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/1cvxwfq/shinji_and_aizen_being_perfect_character_parallels/) which I'm proud of- they are a strong dynamic that deserves more flowers for bring well-written. There are a ton of parallels between them, but since we're tackling presentation, we should note that *they initially gave the opposite impressions*.

Shinji's design does present an impression on the surface-level, of someone who may appear to be a jerk. Nefariously villainous with his toothy smile. However, there’s a thematic element at play of ‘perception’, just like with Aizen. He turns out to be a decent guy. Eccentric, interesting tastes, nonchalant… but a good person at heart.

But it didn’t seem that way at first. *A reversal of perception*, if I say so myself.

Aizen had a kindly appearance; a tall man with dark brown hair and glasses, who spoke softly and seemed like a teacher of sorts. Post-defection, we see Aizen as callous and cold (with a lot more complicated reasoning to it), an inversion of our first impression. Shinji turns out to be pretty nice beneath the whole weird guy shtick.

They have a very complicated bond, and despite trying to detach, the influence they have on each still remains strong and present in their psyche, much like it does for others like Momo and Toshiro. Shinji and Aizen have a zanpakuto that can affect people’s senses, and the way it appears as a theme is our impression of them being antithetical to their true selves.

# The Hollow Mask

https://preview.redd.it/qosh4hhl2zrf1.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=d85b9c4e37f41acbaf054c200563b04e9cadc30a

Shinji's hollow mask has been brought up for style reasons, and the fact that it resembles the mask of a Pharaoh. But there is a little more nuance rather than just fashion.

As for the mask itself, it has two slits for his eyes. If you notice the lower half of the mask, it is meant to *reflect his human look of having prominent teeth by having it carved out like the bones are exposed in his hollowfied form*. There's also a slit down the middle, like it's dividing his face into two parts.

The hood that goes over his head and flows into the back is similar to the **Nemes** headdress, which is a striped head cloth worn by Pharaohs. The way it falls in line with his hair also reinforces the imagery (as well as the golden colour of the masks with Shinji's blond hair).

While we associate the mask with the golden relic of Tutankhamen's face, it is still a **funerary mask**. It's *inherently connected to death*. But that isn't solely the end of it, it was believed it to be a connection to divinity and the spiritual world.

Since Aizen brings up the speech about godhood to Shinji (and that Shinji was in the chapter spread for '*Tug Your God Out*'), it can be inferred that the whole idea of ascending to greater heights connects with the idea of transcending the nature of being hollow/human, which is part of Aizen's experimentation. Thus connecting Shinji to that theme of transcendence.

The fact that it feels exotic and foreign is part of the magic of the design- the Vizards feel like outsiders, so their masks are not inherently... localized, if that makes sense. Shinji's mask takes on the Pharaoh-inspired look, which feels more regal but distinguished from the more 'Japanese' side we've seen with characters like Byakuya or Shunsui.

# Sakanade

https://preview.redd.it/yjrkxf9m2zrf1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=383fec0b9b719346fdd57f1dba4e52446ace1073

I know it's an analysis of Shinji's design, but since the zanpakuto reflects the soul of the user, I find it fitting that we at least briefly touch on *Sakanade.*

For those who know nothing about swords, don't fret! Here's a little roundup of what I'll be covering:

* You probably know what the *blade* is already.
* The **hilt** is everything below the blade (basically, what is not the blade). It consists of a *guard*, *grip*, and *pommel*.
* The **grip** is where we place our hands on the blade.
* A **guard**, or **handguard**, is between the blade and the grip, it usually extends horizontally.
* The **pommel** is placed at the very end, below the grip. It sometimes takes on ornate shapes.

Let's get on to Shinji's zanpakuto.

There is a lot of inconsistencies to it's colour, but *in its sealed state, Sakanade possibly has a red hilt*. **The unsealed state is definitely green**, even if the depictions of it are generally conflicting (the OG anime is all over the place in terms of colour, like Gin's red eyes; but TYBW shows us the green hilt of Sakanade).

As for the green colour in shikai, there's some [interesting connections](https://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/1jvelec/comment/mma2uz3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to the flower of Squad Five, to Aizen (who also has a green handle for his zanpakuto!) also to Momo. His bankai also has purple/pink mist, which again ties him to those themes (since the pink variant of the squad five flower is rare, and it also appears on [Momo's clip](https://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/1h3auek/a_detailed_analysis_of_kubos_character_design/) in the new arc).

As Aizen himself says, the shape is quite interesting. The very end of the blade, the *pommel*, becomes a whole ring when released. It has no combat purpose on a surface level, perhaps simply aesthetic in how he rotates the blade- but it is an extension of the blade's ability to reverse an opponent's sense of direction.

The circular pommel contrasts his design in that it's a circle- and nothing narrow. His entire frame is full of 'lines', making him feel narrow and sharp as a choice of presentation. But his zanpakuto has a huge ring, breaking that line. His blade however, is also quite thin (and dotted with little holes as well). 

Also, notice how his bankai involves a flower on water (lotus)? Ironic that Aizen also has a flower/water motif in the very name of his zanpakuto. They also both have gold elements on their zanpakuto. It's a lot of stuff that I won't cover here, maybe in the future.

# Design Contrast

https://preview.redd.it/gb9tjuen2zrf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=92234d322253cd7d2bb2ac6b66a16ed050f19961

We are FINALLY at the last part, and you are probably exhausted by now.

Shinji is paired up interestingly with characters in design. Ichigo and him have the same brown eyes (and Aizen, too). But they are quite different in regards to their distinctive aesthetic and taste, from the way they style their hair to the obvious clothing differences.

Aizen and Shinji have the opposite themes going on, with the teacher-look turning out to be a villain while the latter's scheming villain appearance gave way to the mentor role for Ichigo. Their aesthetic choices are different, with Aizen always picking long and flowing robes to showcase his grandeur, while Shinji noticeably always remains thin in his clothes (but never in an unhealthy way).

Kisuke and him have an interesting thing going on in terms of how their eyes are covered in some measure (hence, hindering any insight into themselves or their intentions). Momo absolutely opposes Shinji with her darker hair and wide eyes... but they still are a perfect thematic connection.

Here's some goofiness to end on!

My grandfather is in a bind. No one expected my grandmother to pass away first, but she did around eight years ago. Unfortunately, no one in my family wanted to help take care of my grandfather, so I took it upon myself to get him set up. 

For the past six years, I have found him 24/7 aides to help. They do a pretty good job and he’s had pretty consistent aides. 

We have been utilizing his long-term healthcare and the VA. This has been working out incredibly well up until the last few months.

He is a 100% disabled service veteran. He is blind. He has issues with balance and generally very uncomfortable at all times at this point. Headaches, nausea, bad heart, fluids building up. 

He is relatively immobile at this point with needing help getting in and out of bed, walking around on a walker, and recently in the last three months, he’s become unable to sleep and from that it has gotten to the point of where his aides are quitting. 4 this month.

I really think this all started with changing up his daily habits of 30 years. Caffeine consumption being the most important. He has one cup of coffee a day down from 10. I think he’s having withdrawals and that’s why he’s nauseous, has headaches, and can’t sleep.

But it’s been three months of this. He is on various medication for anxiety and now sleep and nothing is helping. He literally can’t be left alone. He wants his hand held at all times. He unfortunately urinates every 30 to 40 minutes.

I’m not really sure what I’m supposed to do at this point. He is so incredibly uncomfortable and it’s depressing telling him that we can’t give him any more medication to help him feel better.

Everyone is pressuring me to get hospice. But hospice will not work in his house unless a family member is there. Unfortunately no family member is willing to be there or can be there for the several months to years that he might actually have left.

I would just move them into my house, but I’m traveling for a work three days a week. 

I really feel overwhelmed and I really don’t know how to make this work. I feel guilty because all he wants is to stay in his house and I’ve done a pretty good job at finding him the resources and support to do that. However, he’s 88 years old and it seems like these regressing very quickly.

His main doctor suggested hospice and I tried to call them to see what they could do but they require a family member to be in the house.

Does anyone have any suggestions about what I could do?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Miami Dolphins vs. New York Jets: A Tale of Two (Winless) Dynasties**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Monday Night Football clash that’s like watching two chefs argue over who’s *less* qualified to cook a soufflé. The Miami Dolphins (0-3) and New York Jets (0-3) meet in a battle of AFC East doormats, and if this game had a theme song, it’d be “We Are the Champions” played on kazoo. Let’s break it down with the precision of a NFL Films highlight reel and the humor of a Twitter thread written by a disgruntled fan.

---

### The Odds: A Math Problem Only a Sportsbook Would Love

Miami is a modest 2.5-point favorite, which in betting terms is like saying “we’re not *totally* confident, but also… kinda?” The implied probability of a Dolphins win? Let’s do the math. At DraftKings, Miami’s moneyline odds of **-165** (converted from decimal 1.65) translate to a **61.76% chance**. The Jets, at **+230**, imply a **29.85% chance**—which is roughly the odds of me correctly spelling “Breece Hall’s contract extension” off the top of my head (spoiler: I can’t).

The total is set at **44.5 points**, and SportsLine’s model cranks it up to 49. That’s the NFL version of a “bloodbath,” though we’re not talking *Megalodon* vs. *T. rex* here. More like “two guys fighting over the last slice of pizza at a family reunion.”

---

### The Stats: Dolphins Have a Plan, Jets Have a… Hmm

Miami’s offense is a well-oiled machine, led by Tua Tagovailoa, who’s 3-0 against the Jets with **277.5 passing yards per game** and a 76% completion rate. His TD:INT ratio of 3:0 isn’t just efficient—it’s *suspicious*.

1nszqsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/1nszqsp/analyzing_bleachs_character_design_shinji/,Analyzing Bleach's character design: Shinji,"In this post, we’ll be tackling Shinji Hirako.  You know him, don’t ya? Blond-haired, toothy dude. Likes jazz. Has a tongue piercing. Loses via talking method… well, that was uncalled for.  I do love Shinji a great deal.

His fashion sense is quite iconic and has made statements over the years. But as for his design itself, it holds many elements as to why he is popular as it is. Kubo designs him carefully too, and there’s many sides to it that I’d love for you to know.

There will be a ton of visuals in this post! They’re made by me to cover up for the fact that I perhaps write more than I should. [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/1h3auek/a_detailed_analysis_of_kubos_character_design/) of this little series covers Lille, Starrk and many other characters. [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/1jdap6t/analyzing_character_designs_byakuya_and_rangiku/) is Byakuya and Rangiku.

**WARNING: this will be ridiculously long.**

We have a lot to cover with both his presentation and design. Shinji has a gentlemanly set of clothing choices, from ties and newsboy caps to long coats. His frame is quite thin, so longer clothes practically hang off him, but the close-cut ones still emphasize his stature.

Let’s first tackle a concept crucial to Shinji’s design- the *vertical line*.

•────⋅☾ ☽⋅─────••─────⋅☾ ☽⋅─────•

# Staccato, Legato and Movement

In talking about the vertical line, I also want to mention other concepts that will be useful.

If you know a bit of music theory, you’ll be familiar with the terms ‘**staccato**’ and ‘**legato**’. In short: staccato refers to notes that are *quick and short*, briskly played. The opposite is legato, where the notes are all *connected and fluid*.

The idea with staccato is interest. For legato, it is smoothness.

Now if you take the concept into fashion and character design, it works in the same way. A key part of design is the idea of **lines**. Just as notes can be played in staccato and legato, the lines can remain clean and smooth, or they can be broken to create contrast.

**Incorporating different kinds of lines is how you retain a fashionable look, drawing attention to or even away from certain focal points.**

https://preview.redd.it/zcfgc8rlyyrf1.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e885a619f79a1c92ae2bd997146f86abd1dfca9

As you can notice with the lines on the visual above, our eyes travel along the colours as they flow. Tensa Zangetsu & White have cleaner lines, where it remains simple and unbroken, moving along a line from top to bottom with ease.

Tatsuki and Orihime however, break the visual line by wearing pops of colour.  Orihime’s top and skirt are two different shades of pink, while her cardigan is peach. Her shoes are brown, mirroring the colour on Tatsuki’s cap. Tatsuki herself wears a purple top with green pants and red shoes.

There is no real winner in broken versus unbroken lines. It is entirely dependent on the intention of the art and the medium of expression. Where visual interest is concerned, staccato can be used. Where smoothness is required, then legato.  

>**How exactly do you break a line?**

>**You can give varying textures to clothing, use different colours, accessorize well, repeat or add elements across outfits (patterns, clothing types, colours), and pick different fits (ex: a top that highlights character’s muscles versus flared pants – distinctive areas of attention and accentuation).**

Now let’s get into the main point with Shinji. *Kubo portrays him in a clear vertical line- but there are very intentional breaks in between to give him more flair.*

https://preview.redd.it/zah3cvzmyyrf1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f708c002cbe3470f9d6c28572d4540d286828c1

His yellow shirt and black pant combo is iconic, but one of the reasons it works so well is because of his design itself (which others characters would struggle to pull off).

There are two repeating colours: black and yellow. It begins from his hair, all the way down to his dark green shoes. We have the top half of his look being dominated by a light shade (yellow), and the lower half taking on dark shades (black and green). But the colour break is white, which is the belt.

His teeth are pearly white too, but I don't want to sound like a toothpaste advertisement. But **the idea of preserving vertical is kept constant by repeating elements and colours**. Thus, the lines become visually elongated.

We know he is tall- but even more, we know he is thin. The legs take up a majority of his frame, but there’s enough length for his upper body to remind of his stature. His close-cut outfits stick to his skin (hence, we know he is thin), while the looser captain's haori overwhelms his figure (again, we feel he is thin because it’s loose and hangs off him).

The white element acts as the horizontal line break (belt, *maybe* mirroring his teeth). The yellow hair and shirt match. And both the pants and tie are black, and his shoes are a dark green. So there's a sort of continuous flow to the outfit visually in how the colours all come together. That is why it works so well.

Another reason why is an element in art called **visual movement**. While it is more associated with using colours, textures and shapes to draw attention to a focal point, I'd like to touch on how Kubo uses it in his designs and panels to bring liveliness to his character designs.

https://preview.redd.it/mj0r3vroyyrf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=df8b02c394078e755a2a7f2f6be9841fc162ebf4

Certain characters have more *visual flow* than others.

For example, Unohana’s maternal look has a composed feel, fittingly so, as someone who doesn’t engage in combat. But her haori still flows in the wind, and as the curved shape of *Minazuki* breaks the visual ‘straightness’ that her straight-down braided hair brings her.

With her hair down in her return to her role as Kenpachi, there’s always a flowing element as she moves in combat, her hair and coat always in motion. The brutality is all there in how she fights... but it is very graceful all the same in the way she swivels about.

**Shinji’s hair and tie have some visual flow/movement, contributing to a smooth line from top to bottom of the design**. We are always made aware of his thinness, especially the way Kubo always draws his figure from different angles.

In his Arrancar arc fit, there is some visual flow with his tie and hair despite the outfit being cut-close to his figure. It avoids the more ‘packed’ feel we get from buff characters like Kensei or Ginjo due to their regular looks feeling more grounded.

The chest is interesting to think about in connection to the vertical line (*I am strictly talking design and nothing else for those who are concerned*😉), since a broader chest brings an outward movement from the eyes. Instead of focusing on the vertical, our eyes move outward.

As for his captain cloak, it already adds a great deal of that flow for most characters, even characters like Byakuya and Toshiro (who have some rigid elements in their designs, like the former's kenseikan and the latter's icy hair).

Let us go into more solid design elements, shall we?

•────⋅☾ ☽⋅─────••─────⋅☾ ☽⋅─────•

# Shinji Hirako: The Inversion

[ Fun fact: This was supposed to be the very first visual.](https://preview.redd.it/3ech25ypyyrf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd0409c39f31aa2e64a1c065e1f7bb2f2ee218a0)

He has a lot going on visually. Firstly, the blond and uneven hair. It's meant to give off the impression of eccentricity. Textbook villainous jerk. His teeth are also straight and often shown, which again adds to that.

Everything in his design is narrow. His eyes stretch narrowly, his hair is thinly layered, his body is stick-thin and his clothes are close-fitting. But when he adopts his '*British Gentleman*' look later on, he becomes more appealing, because we now know he isn't a villain (since he starts helping Ichigo).

His design is also impacted by Kubo's change in style, as a character appearing from the start of the Arrancar arc, where a notable shift takes place in the art. What started off as sharper cuts and slightly more jagged edges, gained a lot of refinement as the arcs progressed, carrying into Fullbring and TYBW.

Shinji's hair is a visual marker for his character, so we'll tackle that first.

https://preview.redd.it/udqlbk42zyrf1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=99137d94335614d22c4e8f2485f795980221246c

This is very important for you to know, as per Kubo himself: Shinji has naturally smooth hair. If you were wondering what kind of shampoo he uses, there’s your answer. He is simply blessed with sleek and luscious hair that requires no treatment.

Kubo is such a troll😅

A core part of Shinji’s character is his sense of style (since it ties into the theme of self-expression, much like his love for jazz). We also know from Kubo that **he cut his long hair in order to keep up with the times and match his more contemporary outfits**.

It is another character inflection, but Shinji does inherently like to keep up with modern trends and ideas… but at the same time, he is incredibly impacted and influenced by his past.

Yes, he changes his clothes. And his hair is different. But *he carries the same self that he was from back then, and there’s a disillusionment that goes unnoticed underneath his more flamboyant side*. Not that any of that isn’t genuine. He embodies both and learns to come to terms with it later (and having Momo and the Vizards was a part of his healing process).

Notably, he doesn’t have Yumichika’s ideology of appearing beautiful and being offended if he isn’t considered as such, he simply likes to express himself the way he wants. Whether that impresses or puts off people isn’t really his concern.

Away from deep character tidbits and on to hair and styling (I’m joking, you will be getting both)!

Shinji has uneven blond hair. It is a *blunt-cut hairstyle*, meaning that the hair is cut across in a straight line, no layering or softer edges. A crisp cut with all the hair in a similar length. The opposite of characters like Rangiku and Jugram (who have more layers in their blond tresses).

*Asymmetry* is also something Shinji incorporates well in his hair as time passes, with his fringe getting more uneven post-Arrancar.

In the past, his hair is quite long and luscious. There is a bit more flow to the hair due to it's length. After being reinstated to the Gotei 13, both him and Momo change their hairstyles (post-Aizen effect, as a way of moving on). His future look keeps the uneven fringe.

I wonder who his barber is.

https://preview.redd.it/5is2ya4wyyrf1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=b897211361d40a58dd93ba14052d549de79742f5

**Eyes are perhaps one of the most beautiful parts of Bleach**. They reveal characters in a way that their words cannot; while words can create an impression, it can be discerned of its truthfulness by the eyes.

Unohana has a combination of both her narrowed and softer gaze at the end of her duel (symbolizing the integration of the healer and fighter), Jugram's stoicism is betrayed by his softer eyes, Byakuya's grey set gives away a lot of grief and thoughtfulness, while Aizen's closeups are weary and melancholic.

Shinji is not an outlier in the theme of eyes and honesty. His gaze is weary, surprisingly serious and focused in comparison to the wide smiles we see in panels. There is a lot of exhaustion in his narrow gaze as well. There is a melancholy to it that feels different from Aizen and Kisuke in their closeups.

I should have mentioned this first, but his eye colour is *brown*. Interestingly, there's a pattern of brown eyes all coming from this squad (Aizen, Shinji, Momo... and even the OG Captain!).

While I'd argue the eyes are a huge part of characterization, the case is doubled down when it comes to Shinji and Aizen specifically... because *their whole deal involves illusions/hypnosis, dragging people into a world where you are under their control*.

It is a heavier idea for Aizen, whose set of abilities require people to see the release of his blade to begin with (which connects him even more to Tosen and Gin in the 'sight' theme). But it also involves perception and sensation, which heavily factors Shinji.

•────⋅☾ ☽⋅─────••─────⋅☾ ☽⋅─────•

# Style

https://preview.redd.it/uya0d6y6zyrf1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3d602e4245138e6e8771df633ebce7a1a962c86

For Shinji's normal sense of fashion, he is mostly seen with shirts and ties, formal pants and even jeans. His appearances all throughout Arrancar reinforce that preference for close-cut outfits, ones that aren't pulled tight but still stay close to the skin.

There are distinct ties to **British-mod styles** from the 60s, with the coats and collared shirts. Colours in the era were bright, taking inspiration from the Ivy League style (an earlier version of the 'preppy' aesthetic).

*Skinny ties* were incorporated into several looks, usually in black. *Newsboy caps* were also quite a thing back then (Shinji's signature cap), as well as *narrow trousers*. Clothing was well-tailored with crisp cuts and defined outlines.

Mod-style is influenced by many cultures, from Italian and Spanish styles to Hispanic and black culture. The idea was to escape the daily hum-drum by exploring and assimilating foreign elements to their style and as an aesthetic choice to live by. It started with England but became a buzz in the US and abroad.

Jazz is also associated with this era, since youths frequented jazz clubs. They also began to adopt foreign elements into their look, hence earning the title as *Modernists-* or **mods**. It aesthetically fits Shinji quite well, especially the theme of an evolving style.

https://preview.redd.it/jcc89wl8zyrf1.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=871668fc254d92f0786e7e1f4ccb2e8282a75949

Kubo is quite intentional in how he draws Shinji, as a character who is particular about his clothing choices. He is the only one among the Visoreds who has a constant outfit change, even in artworks. The rest stick to their regular looks (they are still great designs!).

It's also interesting that the **Visoreds all have some form of white somewhere in their design**. I mean, you could say that for nearly every character, but there is a sort of tie-in to white at every turn.

Shinji's belt is white, Rose/Hiyori/Hachi all have inner white vests or shirts, Lisa has a white top, Mashiro's armour is white. Kensei's hair is white (his vest takes on a white lining later), and Love has a white accessory (line?) across his outfit. Their colours are all distinct; but there is a common thread.

I cannot believe I didn't notice that Shinji had a clip on his tie till now. I thought I was being smart😂

https://preview.redd.it/9qs5s51czyrf1.png?width=1637&format=png&auto=webp&s=9302ab28f93b7ae27d6580c9743493d7da180541

Shinji cannot help but add his personal flair to everything. He achieves his distinctive look with his accessories.

The collars usually have a tie. Shirts are layered with coats and pullovers. He even opts for a gold chain necklace in his Cour 2 Opening. And a tongue piercing.

It's a change from the more classically Japanese aesthetic we had seen so far in their story, esp. with the Shinigami in their robes and all the motifs that came with it. His style is more contemporary and snazzy.

The look in the first volume sees him with a black wrist accessory (it has a smiley on it!), and a chain tied to his belt. Hanging from his white belt in his Arrancar look is the strap of his belt, which he tucks to the side rather than bringing it around all the way through the holes.

Shinji wears a lot of collared shirts in official arts- his first volume appearance is in the school's uniform, then there's the yellow shirt with/without the shoulder design, and his grey coat when fighting Grimmjow.

This isn't for every character, but *closing off the neck visually holds meaning.* It was used in Soi-Fon's Cour 2 opening look too. But the idea is that **there is something that is hidden, something the character holds close** (it could be anything); the overall vibe is being 'closed' off. Not every case of course, but it is in some cases.

Shinji almost always chooses looks that reach up to his neck or cover it in some fashion. That includes wearing collars, ties, cravats and turtlenecks. But in the flashbacks, he didn't have it any measure. So that means he adopts the look as a little fashion quirk... but that still reflects a part of him in some measure, how he approaches the world (mistrust).

The current look incorporates a yellow wrap around his neck, pinned together with a pastel purplish clip, which has a little pink detail. Again, the colours are relevant (Momo has pink/red for her primary colours, and Aizen's purple pops up a lot for Shinji).

His Fullbring look adds a white *cravat* tucked under the shirt and a white knotted sash. A new robe is under his captain’s haori but over the shihakusho, pinned at the front. If you're wondering what a cravat is, in America, you'd call it as an **ascot** (think of Fred Jones' tie from Scooby Doo).

His shoes are green, his socks are also depicted as green in the look below. Though Kubo has placed him in black dress shoes before. As a Shinigami, he wears the regular tabi socks with waraji (footwear).

https://preview.redd.it/bgm5aqfdzyrf1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=789ff55176b1c1a1acdc01da36ea2d4d62b58299

This is a favourite cover of mine, I absolutely love the amount of details thrown in. It feels so cozy!

His sweater is a muted shade of yellow (an obvious nod to his design), combined with a pale-coloured shirt and pants. The tie is orange, much like the inner material of the trousers. His socks and headphones are both green. Most of the colours in his look repeat somewhere in the environment, creating a connection between the disparate elements.

I mentioned all the colours straight up, since we'll be covering more details on how it all ties together.

Shinji is wearing a V-neck sweater (ideal for layering over a shirt and elongating the torso), with ribbing at the neck, cuffs and hem. The neckline for the sweater is much deeper, allowing for the tie to pop out a bit better.

The inner material of the trouser is plaid (more English references!). Soi-Fon also wore plaid in the Cour 2 opening. It's something that leans into a relaxed/polished feel, with Shinji opting for the colour to be orange. The checkered pattern pops up on his tie as well.

I won't bore you with details on if it's *tattersall plaid* or the *tartan plaid*, but orange may be a reference to Ichigo, who is notably someone Shinji looks up to. Kubo has a habit of doing that (ex: Rangiku's Cour 2 OP fit featured a snake-shaped ring, a reference to Gin).

What is cool is how both the shirt and trousers get more '*interest*' to showcase Shinji's sense of style.

The sleeves on one side are rolled up for *both* the shirt and the sweater, allowing us to not only to notice the actual shirt underneath (since our eyes will be drawn to the colour of the shirt as well), but also showcase his bangle.

As for the other arm, it is fully covered with his sleeve. But has a ring to compensate for its 'simplicity' in lacking heavy detail.

His legs are crossed, and one leg is out of view. Thus, we can see the green sock on the crossed leg, since it isn't out of view. *If you posed him with his outstretched legs, we wouldn't see either foot*. But since Shinji crosses one leg, we are able to see the sock and know it's on the other foot as well.

The crossed leg gets a cuffed hem, so we get to see the inner material of the trouser (the plaid).

Shinji here is wearing a red ring on his middle finger. He also has a gold bangle on his wrist (again, emphasis on accessories). Shinji is tied to gold a ton (and regality, pretty Pharoah-esque), sporting a gold chain necklace in his Cour 2 OP look, as well as being cocooned into a gold lotus in his bankai.

Many details are in the surroundings which give so much life to it- the coffee mug with a spoon in it, the looped wire, the fairly organized library contrasting the mild chaos outside, the edge/railing on the right with orange/green to connect to the rest of the work... just brilliant.

Notably, we do not see Shinji's eyes during this spread- something common to Kisuke, who usually shrouds them beneath his hat; symbolic of closing oneself off from something (esp. considering the eyes as the most honest part of a character). It is more closure for Kisuke, but it holds stylistic value for Shinji's characterization too.

Of course, you know he's listening to something absolutely fantastic with those headphones.

https://preview.redd.it/yn504oaezyrf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a284820fd39bded51fd5b2bcc91a094538335b43

*Note: I will try and keep this short, this section is LONG.*

The above two visuals have quiet references to Shinji's nature as hybrid of Shinigami and Hollow. You're probably wondering how.

Did you notice the colours in the coat look? Black, white and grey. All incredibly neutral colours of course. Not much of a colour pop and unlike himself. But it represents his makeup as one of the Visored (ahem... I must mention this is a supposed symbolism). **He also fights in this style particularly to show Ichigo his hollow side**.

Black is characteristic of the Shinigami (his shirt), the white as a hollow (his tie and pants are white). However, the coat he puts over it all is grey, a blend of both black and white. The mask is... a mask, he is not a total hollow. But he isn't a complete Shinigami without his mask either. Hence the grey in combo with the black and white.

As for the second, it isn't just a reference to Shinji being a hollow in it's entirety. But the idea of it being tied to godhood, hence the title: **Tug Your God Out**.

The meaning in the lore is to drag the hollow out of Ichigo, but the fact that is associated with being a 'god' is interesting- and **Shinji is the receiver of Aizen's speech about being a god in Fake Karakura Town**. Which means that it does connect to a transcendence (reminder that this is not power-scaling), in being above and beyond the nature of the ordinary.

# Flashback Portrayal

https://preview.redd.it/0tzco5s11zrf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=849e2786e3363ced21aaea8c308a32bf39454596

There's a lot going on in Turn Back the Pendulum, a lot that explains Shinji as a character. But I'll hold my tongue (my keyboard, I mean).

In terms of design, **Shinji is a little... less individualistic in his fashion choice during this era**. It makes sense too, since he is still 'young', so to speak, and his sense of style isn't as developed (it was his exposure to the World of the Living that truly allowed him external perspectives). He wears the regular shihakusho in tandem with the white haori.

*Not to say he wasn't individualistic*. He liked jazz, something that is creative and even chaotic in nature. Which Aizen didn't understand (as someone pointed out wonderfully, Aizen is incredibly put at unease by lack of control overall, so he doesn't really understand jazz).

The other thing he has going for him is his longer hair, which is what gives him away from coming from this time. Much like Shunsui and Ukitake with their long hair, Shinji also has the same feel, blending in well with the rest of the group. Rose has long blond hair too, as well as Yoruichi and Unohana.

While he looks beautiful with long hair, there's a part of Shinji that doesn't feel right without the blunt-cut hairstyle. Not just because of our familiarity with that look, but also how key his visual presentation is to his characterization.

In looking at his flashback appearance, you don't think '*mysterious jerk*' right away. Or '*shady guy with unsavoury intent*'. There's a lot more, and you can even tell there is a regal quality to him. Again, that reflects in his hollow mask (as well as his advice to Kisuke).

https://preview.redd.it/h5fxczuozyrf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b05fc96cb321f30f311e06d5c79084e34a08cf7e

During the flashback, we get a more reflective version of Shinji. He is still eccentric, but still complies with events and is prone to making comments. **Underneath all the strangeness is someone who does see through people quite well**, and is caring. Something we know at this point is untrue for Aizen.

Shinji comes across as brutally honest, commenting on several things that inform us about the time period (the Tenth Kenpachi, the inauguration). There is a different kind of burden that he carries, and it reflects in his leadership role.

It's also important to note that *there was never much innocence in how Shinji was portrayed*. He always seemed to be relaxed but keen. A part of himself that is alert and intuitive, always ready for something. But there is a quick slip for a panel or two.

As he hears Aizen's voice, you can see the vulnerable look in his eyes, something we rarely ever see from Shinji (I put it up there with his angered expression at Hiyori's bisection). He quickly switches from that look, unwilling to let Aizen have control as he reveals himself- and his face twists in anger and realization.

There's an underlying frustration that runs throughout Shinji's arc. It comes from mistrust as well as his own nature, and Aizen reinforced that part of him even more. However, it becomes a point of growth.

I'll touch on Aizen as well. People overlook a small tidbit in their forest interaction, the idea that **Aizen may have genuinely wanted Shinji to see through him**. But he doesn't, as referenced by his little iconic callback (""*since you were in your mother's womb*"").

But why? As Ichigo points out, Aizen genuinely did want to connect with people. But he can't detach himself from the bonds he created. So he tries forcibly severing them because they do not match his 'ideal' as a godlike being. But it hurts, because he wanted someone to understand him at his level.

*Aizen still held Shinji to a standard*, had some expectations for him. That's why he directed the trust speech at Shinji, explaining what it meant to be a 'god'. Kind of like he wants *him specifically* to admit it.

You see, Shinji wanted to believe he was somehow responsible for it all, like he somehow could impact and even change Aizen (CFYOW lore: *Sakanade* was very interested in Aizen, and Shinji was interesting in the kind of person Aizen really was). It's the same brand of arrogance as his lieutenant. They see a lot of themselves in each other but refuse to admit it, hence, it hinders a real connection from forming.

This is where we come to the next part.

# Characterization

I admit, this is where I wanted to expand the most, since I absolutely adore stories and theming, but I'll try and not go on tangents.

Shinji and Kisuke both guided Ichigo on his journey to rediscovery, and they both provided an entry for him to his inner world. In the case of Kisuke, Ichigo learned the name of his blade, the very essence of being a Shinigami. With Shinji, he learns to better integrate White, the other part of himself.

It's important to note how those two characters have a lot of care for Ichigo in different ways, and how deeply impacted they were by Aizen's actions towards them. They seem somewhat similar on the surface, but are actually a great deal different.

Kisuke's characterization in the story follows an interesting deviation from the classical scientist type, while Shinji takes on a **relaxed but fairly critical worldview**. You could say he is a creative type at heart, but he is also deeply intuitive and aware of people and systems on a deeper level... to the point that it overwhelms and frustrates him.

While Kisuke and Shinji are both seemingly lax, Kisuke's intellect is made an point of prominence in the story- but for Shinji, while he is smart and witty, falls closer into having sharp intuition. They also seem different in their brand of 'relaxed', with Kisuke putting on the appearance of being a chill shopkeeper and Shinji as an unbothered lover of jazz who is aware of cultural trends.

Shunsui also comes into play here for his more relaxed nature, but again, the trope differs, as he proves to be ruthless in combat, not holding on to pride in keeping a moral high ground. He sticks to drinking a lot more, something which neither Shinji or Kisuke share (but Rangiku does! But is also serves other other purposes for her character).

One of the key distinctive traits that make Shinji stand out is **eccentricity**.

https://preview.redd.it/h4ck79uzzyrf1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=23b955155b8b1b88f257c179be516234d2df4f17

In his presentation, Shinji is frequently seen raising his shoulders, his hands in his pockets or on his hips, a toothy grin plastered across his face, head tilted, seated learning forward with hands together in the front.

There is a lot of relaxed poise here, but a quiet authority and individuality with it. A lot of finger movements as well (the chapter spread titled 'Hush', with his finger on his lips), or him swinging his zanpakuto. Many crossed legs too, featured in chapter covers.

You get the impression of someone who has odd habits, they way he talks and the way he deals with people, but there's also a quiet mystique to him.

But his eyes are always frequently depicted to be narrowed, focused and weary. It is hard to escape that if you look closely as he talks to Ichigo and Aizen. It is vital to Shinji's character, someone who is deeply frustrated and disillusioned by the world.

Presentation connects to how we perceive the character. Thus, we see Shinji as someone who is quite relaxed, doesn't care much about opinions and is his own person, but is quite caring to people overall. His eyes give more nuance to it, where we see a ton of weariness and mistrust, as well as a dispositional seriousness as situations call for it.

The reversal theme plays so heavily into his character, especially to how we initially perceived him versus what he turned out to be. Funnily enough, that is the exact opposite of how we saw Aizen.

https://preview.redd.it/8v71b33zzyrf1.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=af1e0370581768eecd5503d536c3bfe26f736f18

I did have [quite a popular post on Shinji and Aizen](https://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/1cvxwfq/shinji_and_aizen_being_perfect_character_parallels/) which I'm proud of- they are a strong dynamic that deserves more flowers for bring well-written. There are a ton of parallels between them, but since we're tackling presentation, we should note that *they initially gave the opposite impressions*.

Shinji's design does present an impression on the surface-level, of someone who may appear to be a jerk. Nefariously villainous with his toothy smile. However, there’s a thematic element at play of ‘perception’, just like with Aizen. He turns out to be a decent guy. Eccentric, interesting tastes, nonchalant… but a good person at heart.

But it didn’t seem that way at first. *A reversal of perception*, if I say so myself.

Aizen had a kindly appearance; a tall man with dark brown hair and glasses, who spoke softly and seemed like a teacher of sorts. Post-defection, we see Aizen as callous and cold (with a lot more complicated reasoning to it), an inversion of our first impression. Shinji turns out to be pretty nice beneath the whole weird guy shtick.

They have a very complicated bond, and despite trying to detach, the influence they have on each still remains strong and present in their psyche, much like it does for others like Momo and Toshiro. Shinji and Aizen have a zanpakuto that can affect people’s senses, and the way it appears as a theme is our impression of them being antithetical to their true selves.

# The Hollow Mask

https://preview.redd.it/qjs386v30zrf1.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a2c4e30b1dcf925f93156b43db54147816885c0

Shinji's hollow mask has been brought up for style reasons, and the fact that it resembles the mask of a Pharaoh. But there is a little more nuance rather than just fashion.

As for the mask itself, it has two slits for his eyes. If you notice the lower half of the mask, it is meant to *reflect his human look of having prominent teeth by having it carved out like the bones are exposed in his hollowfied form*. There's also a slit down the middle, like it's dividing his face into two parts.

The hood that goes over his head and flows into the back is similar to the **Nemes** headdress, which is a striped head cloth worn by Pharaohs. The way it falls in line with his hair also reinforces the imagery (as well as the golden colour of the masks with Shinji's blond hair).

While we associate the mask with the golden relic of Tutankhamen's face, it is still a **funerary mask**. It's *inherently connected to death*. But that isn't solely the end of it, it was believed it to be a connection to divinity and the spiritual world.

Since Aizen brings up the speech about godhood to Shinji (and that Shinji was in the chapter spread for '*Tug Your God Out*'), it can be inferred that the whole idea of ascending to greater heights connects with the idea of transcending the nature of being hollow/human, which is part of Aizen's experimentation. Thus connecting Shinji to that theme of transcendence.

The fact that it feels exotic and foreign is part of the magic of the design- the Vizards feel like outsiders, so their masks are not inherently... localized, if that makes sense. Shinji's mask takes on the Pharaoh-inspired look, which feels more regal but distinguished from the more 'Japanese' side we've seen with characters like Byakuya or Shunsui.

# Sakanade

https://preview.redd.it/9s6fp6o40zrf1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1a50515b3c5f019b9c5eb978a28f1cff60aa965

I know it's an analysis of Shinji's design, but since the zanpakuto reflects the soul of the user, I find it fitting that we at least briefly touch on *Sakanade.*

For those who know nothing about swords, don't fret! Here's a little roundup of what I'll be covering:

* You probably know what the blade is already.
* The **hilt** is everything below the blade (basically, what is not the blade). It consists of a *guard*, *grip*, and *pommel*.
* The **grip** is where we place our hands on the blade.
* A **guard**, or **handguard**, is between the blade and the grip, it usually extends horizontally.
* The **pommel** is placed at the very end, below the grip. It sometimes takes on ornate shapes.

Let's get on to Shinji's zanpakuto.

There is a lot of inconsistencies to it's colour, but *in its sealed state, Sakanade possibly has a red hilt*. **The unsealed state is definitely green**, even if the depictions of it are generally conflicting (the OG anime is all over the place in terms of colour, like Gin's red eyes; but TYBW shows us the green hilt of Sakanade).

As for the green colour in shikai, there's some [interesting connections](https://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/1jvelec/comment/mma2uz3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to the flower of Squad Five, to Aizen (who also has a green handle for his zanpakuto!) also to Momo. His bankai also has purple/pink mist, which again ties him to those themes (since the pink variant of the squad five flower is rare, and it also appears on [Momo's clip](https://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/1h3auek/a_detailed_analysis_of_kubos_character_design/) in the new arc).

As Aizen himself says, the shape is quite interesting. The very end of the blade, the *pommel*, becomes a whole ring when released. It has no combat purpose on a surface level, perhaps simply aesthetic in how he rotates the blade- but it is an extension of the blade's ability to reverse an opponent's sense of direction.

The circular pommel contrasts his design in that it's a circle- and nothing narrow. His entire frame is full of 'lines', making him feel narrow and sharp as a choice of presentation. But his zanpakuto has a huge ring, breaking that line. His blade however, is also quite thin (and dotted with little holes as well). 

Also, notice how his bankai involves a flower on water (lotus)? Ironic that Aizen also has a flower/water motif in the very name of his zanpakuto. They also both have gold elements on their zanpakuto. It's a lot of stuff that I won't cover here, maybe in the future.

# Design Contrast

https://preview.redd.it/6dq2fs8a0zrf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb325f5391125f40b8ae1a740e239a252aa87941

We are FINALLY at the last part, and you are probably exhausted by now.

Shinji is paired up interestingly with characters in design. Ichigo and him have the same brown eyes (and Aizen, too). But they are quite different in regards to their distinctive aesthetic and taste, from the way they style their hair to the obvious clothing differences.

Aizen and Shinji have the opposite themes going on, with the teacher-look turning out to be a villain while the latter's scheming villain appearance gave way to the mentor role for Ichigo. Their aesthetic choices are different, with Aizen always picking long and flowing robes to showcase his grandeur, while Shinji noticeably always remains thin in his clothes (but never in an unhealthy way).

Kisuke and him have an interesting thing going on in terms of how their eyes are covered in some measure (hence, hindering any insight into themselves or their intentions). Momo absolutely opposes Shinji with her darker hair and wide eyes... but they still are a perfect thematic connection.

Here's a goofy finisher!

Chroseus’ Unrequited Nap

Chapter 1
Chroseus Awakened


“Must you rouse me from glory?” groaned Chroseus as the maid crept into his chambers. His eyelids clung together like loyal soldiers refusing to retreat.
“Forgive me, Lord Chroseus,” she replied, unbothered. “But this is literally what you pay me for. Also, your men await you in the courtyard. Try not to look like death when you arrive.”
Chroseus dragged himself upright, mourning the twenty sacred minutes of rest denied to him. “Truly,” he muttered, “no tyrant is crueler than a woman armed with a cleaning schedule.”

Chroseus stumbled into the courtyard, robe dragging like a defeated banner. He fantasized of the nap he would one day take, if the gods showed mercy.
“BEHOLD! THE LORD OF PILLOWS AWAKENS!” bellowed Bromius, scaring every bird from the trees.
Chroseus clamped his ears. “Truly, Bromius, the gods gave you the lungs of an elephant and the wit of one too.”
“Drink this! NOW! QUICK!” shrieked Lentulus, practically vibrating as he shoved a steaming cup into Chroseus’s hands. “It has coffee, mushrooms, goat blood—I lost count after ingredient seven but TRUST ME you’ll feel amazing.”
“Now, my lord,” began Petrus, stepping forward with solemn grace, “we must not be late to the throne room, for the king has a mission of utmost importance. I hear the reward shall be handsome, and when at last I secure my portion I shall finally purchase that dairy farm I have long dreamed of, where I shall raise goats and sheep and perhaps a pig or two if my wife allows it—and, speaking of wives, I intend to seek a fair maiden, the kind who—”
“PETRUS,” barked Chroseus. “Silence.”
“Last I saw, Caius dove into that haystack,” chirped Lentulus, jittering in place.
Chroseus trudged over and peeled back the hay to find Caius trembling like a leaf.
“Caius. What now?”
“DON’T KILL ME!” screamed Caius. “The birds! They fled the trees! It’s an omen! We’re all doomed!”
Chroseus rubbed his temples, gathering his men. “The king had better make this worth my nap.”

The men made their way toward the palace, passing through the town square.
“Here come the mighty men who saved our kingdom!” children chanted.
A mother yanked her child back. “Don’t touch them—you’ll catch their misfortune!”
“Move aside! You’re blocking my shop,” barked a shopkeeper.
“A THOUSAND APOLOGIES!” roared Bromius. The pottery rattled, then shattered. Birds fled the square.
Children gasped. “Wow… so powerful.”
The shopkeeper muttered, “So destructive.”
“Lentulus, let us go! This is no time for herbs,” said Chroseus.
Lentulus shoved the bundle into his mouth.
“It’s poison! Spit it out!” cried Caius.
“Ah, the scent reminds me of fields from my childhood,” droned Petrus. “We would run with the deer, chase the boar, sing songs of—”
“Enough, Petrus,” yawned Chroseus, nearly stumbling.
At last they reached the castle.

“What business have you scoundrels here?” the guard demanded.
Chroseus rubbed his eyes. “Business? I’ve been robbed of my nap. Say another word and I’ll collapse right here at your gate—armor, drool, and all.”
The guard blinked, then sighed. “Choleric as always… I’ll alert the king.”

Moments later, they stood before the throne of King Valorion.
Valorion rose, his voice iron wrapped in silk.
“Chroseus. My greatest warriors. A relic has been taken—not gold, not jewels, but the very soul of this kingdom. Beyond the mountain lies a treasure beyond price. Without it, my nights are restless, my reign uncertain, and the kingdom itself trembles.”
From behind the throne, the queen dowager Marcellia’s ring tapped the armrest—once, twice—disapproval measured in metal.
He leveled his gaze. “Bring it back to me. Fail… and all shall wither.”
Caius cowered. “The end is nigh!”
“BY THE GODS, THE KING COMMANDS!” bellowed Bromius. His shout shook dust from the rafters—and, impossibly, a dozen doves exploded out of the ceiling beams, flapping wildly before vanishing through the windows.
Courtiers screamed and ducked.
Chroseus groaned. “Where do they even come from?”",1,1759093659.0,writers,1,1.0,False

When I stumbled across an article claiming that only 200,000 Jews perished in Nazi camps—not six million—my first reaction wasn’t outrage, it was **confusion**. A pause. Then guilt.  
Images of skeletal prisoners and ash-filled crematoria flashed across my mind, yet for a moment the number felt abstract—five million, six million, two hundred thousand. In that instant I saw how easy it is, even for someone who knows better, to become numb to atrocity. I made coffee, checked the scores, and moved on.

That numbness is the same disease infecting our relationship with technology.  
We built an unfinished digital revolution—a tool meant for connection that mutated into a labyrinth of distraction, rage, and harm. We handed the next generation not a miracle but a maze.

At the dawn of the internet, there was utopian fervor: the Arab Spring, Occupy, the promise of global unity. By 2016, truth itself had become contested terrain. Algorithms amplified lies. Foreign interference blurred reality. A president weaponized falsehood. Platforms designed for community became hunting grounds. Bullying, conspiracy theories, and pornography flourished. We assumed collective accountability would self‑regulate the new frontier. It didn’t.

The mirror shattered, and now the public lives inside the shards. There is no singular “public” anymore—only mutually hostile bubbles, people yelling at each other across fractured realities.

The cost is etched into Generation Z. Studies show overwhelming stress, depression, and existential fatigue among young adults—children raised on screens, steeped in climate anxiety, viral misinformation, and algorithmic manipulation. We gave them boundless information but little wisdom. Connectivity without communion. Identity as performance. Critical thinking, tangible skills, and resilience all dimmed under the blue glow of constant scrolling.

Our miscalculations are stark. Social media, once a college‑student niche, now hosts grandmothers and predators alike. It amplifies movements like #MeToo but corrodes civic discourse. We dismissed the need for guardrails, trusting idealism over pragmatism. The result: a polarized populace, eroded trust, and a generation for whom even basic truths—1 + 1 = 2—feel negotiable.

This isn’t condemnation, it’s confession. **We built this.**  
We normalized the absurd: influencers over experts, outrage over nuance, screens over sunsets. We transitioned from chat rooms to TikTok, from privacy to oversharing, from tangible competence to virtual validation. When the power fails—when the digital veil lifts—what remains? A generation unprepared for silence, stillness, or the weight of unmediated reality.

The high point of techno‑democratic optimism was arguably 2011, a year that began with the Arab Spring and ended with the global Occupy movement. That’s also the year Google Translate arrived on virtually every smartphone—humanity’s attempt to rebuild the Tower of Babel. And yet our new Babel didn’t unite us; it atomized us.

There is a kind of perverse poetry in this unraveling. The internet mirrors our best and worst impulses, our hunger for meaning amid chaos. It reflects a generational clash: Boomers frozen in post‑9/11 trauma, Gen X nostalgic for analog simplicity, Gen Z drowning in digital overload. We are all complicit, all casualties of progress hurtling forward without a compass.

Reckoning begins with humility. Before dismissing flat‑earthers or QAnon, ask what fractures in our collective psyche allowed these beliefs to thrive. Before lamenting Gen Z’s struggles, confront the systems we designed—and failed to mend. History’s ghosts, from Auschwitz to 9/11, demand more than passive remembrance. They require us to forge a world where truth is not relative, where technology serves rather than enslaves, and where generations to come inherit not just our innovations but our wisdom.

He always says I was playing hard to get, but my instincts told me he wasn’t being genuine.

After having my heart broken by someone I truly thought was my soulmate, I finally gave in. I decided to meet up with the man who was telling me everything he knew I wanted to hear. We agreed to meet at a bar. He offered to pick me up, but I declined—having experience with online dating, I wasn’t about to get in a car with someone I barely knew. I arrived first, got myself a drink, and waited.

When he showed up, the night went fine. It wasn’t the best first date, but he seemed like a decent guy. Mature, put together, and caring. I gave him a second date, then a third. That third date should have been a red flag. Afterwards, he pushed for more physical closeness than I was comfortable with. I told him “no” and explained I wanted to take things slow. We had been drinking, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. The next morning, when we met for coffee, he acted cold and distant. Looking back, I see that as the beginning of his manipulation.

This became the pattern of our relationship—he would shower me with attention, then withdraw, or suddenly break things off. I had never been in such a tumultuous relationship. Somehow, he managed to convince me this was love. At one point, he left me, and I almost went back to someone from my past, but when he reappeared, I chose him instead. I thought he was the stable partner I’d been looking for. I couldn’t have been more wrong.

As time went on, his behavior became stranger. He would leave abruptly, avoid staying the night, and insist I didn’t “deserve” what he was doing for me. Eventually, we decided to move in together. At first, things seemed fine, but soon the affection stopped. His drinking increased, and the fights began. I remember crying after he berated me over something as small as a cleaning disagreement. He would punish me with silence until I begged for forgiveness. I had never experienced anything like this in past relationships. The manipulation left me doubting myself, feeling like his treatment was normal and that I was the problem. To everyone else, he looked charming and kind.

We eventually got engaged and later married. When we had our first child, things spiraled. He accused me of cheating, criticized me constantly, and twisted everything I said. When tensions were high, he’d remind me that at least he “didn’t hit me.” The gaslighting was relentless. For a brief period, things seemed better, and I thought the stress of parenthood had caused his behavior. But it didn’t last.

By the time we had our second child, the same old patterns returned. The drinking, the victim-playing, the manipulation—it all came back. I even started recording conversations because he would twist my words and make me feel like I was losing my mind.

Recently, I discovered he had been hiding financial information from me. His reaction was the usual—apologies, excuses, and over-the-top affection. But this time, instead of pulling me back in, it gave me clarity. I finally saw the full picture.

Now, I know I need to get out. But I have to be careful and prepare—make sure I can cover legal costs and protect myself and the kids before I file for divorce.

I hate that I let this go on for so long. I hate that I lost pieces of myself because of his mind games. But now, I’m ready to start reclaiming who I am. But am I an asshole for staying knowing full well that I am out??",2,1759093599.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

1nszma0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nszma0/all_of_my_boyfriends_are_brutally_dying/,All of my boyfriends are brutally dying.,"“It's me, Brianna. Not you.”

That's what my latest boyfriend told me before walking directly into the path of a truck. There was barely anything left of him, just enough to peel off the sidewalk.

I thought our relationship was going well. It's not like I'm desensitized to my boyfriends dying (or ceasing to exist), but it's almost become the norm.

Ben was my first boyfriend in high school and my longest relationship to date.

Fluffy-haired Ben, with his dimpled grin and freckles.

He was the type of guy who should have been popular but chose to keep to himself.

I met him in the principal’s office. Ben was being lectured for ‘sneaking around,’ and I was handing in a late assignment. All he did was wink at me, and I fell.

Hard.

We dated for two years, and I really thought he was the one. Ben told me he loved me, and every Friday he introduced me to a new restaurant. I was in love.

I loved everything about him.

On the night before our senior prom, a drunk driver T-boned my boyfriend's car, killing him instantly. After his funeral, it was like he stopped existing.

His parents left town, and every time I mentioned him, my parents would slowly tilt their heads and act confused.

My brother was the worst for it, considering he and Ben were best friends.

But he just looked at me with this weird, empty look in his eye, like his soul had been ripped out. Eyes are the windows to the soul, apparently, and my brother's soul was MIA.

“Ben?” His expression crumpled. “Wait, who?”

Alex was my emotional support, who later became someone closer.

Funny Alex.

Blonde-but-not-quite-blonde Alex.

I met him in group therapy.

My boyfriend was dead, and he had just lost his mother. We didn't label it, because he had a girlfriend, and I didn't want to move on so quickly. I think we just found comfort in each other.

Eventually, though, Alex became something I wanted to label.

His sense of humor was a breath of fresh air. I didn't go to college because of Ben’s death, settling for a mediocre barista job in town. Alex came in every day with fresh coffee and a sugar cookie.

I think I loved him.

I told him that, half asleep, I told him I wanted to try and be something more with him. Alex looked taken aback, but happy.

We spent the night together.

The morning after, I woke to my mother screaming.

Alex was dead in the bathroom, blood splattered, staining pristine white.

According to the first responders, he died of a self-inflicted head injury. The exact same thing followed. I attended his funeral, and Alex’s family disappeared.

This time, I went back to his house. But according to a neighbor, his house had been abandoned for ten years. I had eaten pancakes in his kitchen just days earlier.

I broke in to see for myself, but the neighbor was right. The hallway was piled with ancient mail and eviction notices. Alex’s room didn't exist. Instead, there was a storage room filled with boxes.

When I got home, my family had already forgotten Alex’s existence.

The town had forgotten him, and yet his blood still stained my bathroom.

Following Alex’s death, I was terrified of getting too close to people.

But Esme made it hard.

She was my third relationship. We met at a bar. 

I was extremely drunk and convinced I was cursed to kill all of my romantic partners. Esme. Cute Esme. Crooked teeth, smudged lipstick, and warm Esme.

Do you know that person you meet and instantly connect with? The person you're sure is your soulmate?

That was Esme.

I told myself I wouldn't get close to her. But I was already talking to this girl, already pouring my life out to her. 

Esme sat and listened, her chin resting on her fist. 

She was a first-year creative writing student, and she had a cat called Peanut.

I didn't remember much after that. 

We hit it off, and next thing I knew, we were curled up in the back of her car watching Buffy on her iPad. 

I told her about my exes, and she nodded and smiled, but I don't think she was really listening.

I told her all of my exes have died, and then been erased from existence.

Esme called me cute. She wanted to base a story around the concept, sitting up and grabbing her phone.

I have this memory of the girl I fell in love with at first sight.

She's nodding along to a Smiths song sputtering from my car radio, typing on her phone. I can hear the tapping of her nails, her lips curving into a smile. 

I can see the exact moment she gets inspiration, pulling her knees to her chest. She's wearing fishnet tights that are torn and a jacket that doesn't fit her.

She is fucking beautiful, and I don't want to lose her.

Alex was beautiful.

He had pretty eyes and brown curls that I liked running my hands through. Ben was beautiful. He made my heart swim, my stomach swarm with butterflies when I first met him. Ben was my first love.

The realization woke me up one night, three months into dating Esme.

Both of them were dead, wiped away like they never existed.

And Esme would follow.

At first, I tried to break it off with her without sounding crazy. I told her it was me, not her, and I wasn't in the mindset for a relationship.

Esme understood, but her eyes didn’t. I didn’t want to lose her. Esme lit up every room she entered. Her obsession with thrifted clothes, badly written poems, and her irrational fear of pandas made her someone I wanted to be with.

So, I stayed with her. I told myself Ben and Alex were just coincidences, that it was nothing to do with me, and I wasn’t indirectly fucking killing the people I fell in love with.

I avoided the ‘L’ word for as long as I could.

It slipped out on my way to work. Esme was driving.

I just said it, and her eyes lit up. She reached out and squeezed my hand.

At work, one of my colleagues, Jasper, caught my eye. When I twisted around to ask him to grab something, I glimpsed his phone screen. It looked like Tinder, though I didn’t recognize the layout.

It reminded me of Twitter, in dark mode. Jasper was leaning against the counter, his thumb hovering over a photo of Esme, chewing his bottom lip.

I watched his thumb prance across the screen before he gave up and swiped left.

Finishing up the woman’s coffee, I handed it over.

“Uhh, I asked for cream.”

Ignoring her, I sidled in front of my colleague, hyper-focused on whatever app he was playing around with. “What's that?”

Jasper looked up, his eyes widening, lips parting like a fucking goldfish.

“Clearly nothing.” Jasper sidestepped me, opened the refrigerator, and pulled out milk. But he already had milk. 

The bastard was stalling. We had zero customers waiting, so it was just the two of us and a long, dragged-out pause.

Jumping up and down on the heels of his feet, he shot me his usual grin, slipping his phone into his apron.

Jasper may have been smiling, but there was something twisted in his expression.

I couldn’t stop myself. “Was that a dating app?”

“Dating app?”

“Excuse me, can I get what I ordered?” The woman demanded, waving her coffee in the air. “I asked for whipped cream.”

Jasper saw that as an excuse, an escape, and nodded, fashioning a grin. He saw an opportunity, and took it.

“Of course, Ma’am! I'll get that for you!” He said, with a little too much sarcasm.

The boy took her coffee with a spring in his step, ducking in the refrigerator for the whipping cream. 

It was a good thing my colleague was marginally attractive guy with cropped blonde hair, and a deadpan voice that *somehow* attracted the ladies. 

Jasper could insult someone directly to their face, and they would just blush and get all tongue tied. I had seen it happen in real time. A girl was flirting with him, and used a *bad* pick-up line, which was something along the lines of, “Did it hurt when you fell from Heaven?”

He laughed, and her eyes brightened. She giggled along with him, nudging her friends. 

But he wasn't laughing with her. I saw the gleam in his eye. 

He was laughing *at* her. 

Still laughing, Jasper plonked her milk latte down so hard half of it spewed out. 

And, with that exact same charming smile, he deadpanned, “Did it hurt when you dropped out of a fucking drainpipe?”

Yeah, my colleague was blessed with good looks. 

Otherwise, he would have been punched in the face by now. 

Presently, he was being his usual asshole self. “Is there anything *else* I can get you?” he grabbed the cream, adding more. ""Tell me when to stop, okay?"" 

""Stop!"" The woman shrieked when he added too much, but he didn't. 

Cream overflowing, Jasper handed her the drink. 

""There ya go! One *creamy* latte!"" he winked. ""Hope ya like it.""

When she left the store, I situated myself in front of him when he was counting cash. “What were you just looking at?” 

I nodded to the guy’s phone sticking out of his pocket. “Was it like… a dating thing you were on?”

Jasper didn't even look at me, his lip curling. 

“That's kinda rude,” he hummed, “I don't peek at your phone.”

“Esme Hope.” Was all I could hiss out. “Was she on that dating app?”

My colleague proceeded to stare at me like I'd grown a second head, before his half lidded gaze flicked behind me. Jasper’s expression brightened. 

“Oh, Hanna is calling me!” He said, choking out a laugh.  

Hanna was *not* calling him. She was in the break room getting high. Jasper slowly backed away, maintaining his smile. 

“I'll be back in a sec, all right?” He grabbed that same carton of milk with a grin. “Don't you just *love* when your milk stays fresh?”

“What?” 

“Fresh milk!” He grinned. “Mulberry Farm’s finest.”

Jasper was darting away before I could coerce a sentence. 

After work, I texted Esme as usual. She was my ride on Fridays. 

Esme didn't reply. 

I texted her again, a little more panicked. 

**Hey, are you okay?”** 

When I called her, an automated voice told me she wasn't available. 

Already feeling sick to my stomach, I drove to her place myself. 

I could see the flashing lights before anything else, blurred red and blue sending my thoughts into a whirlwind. 

It took me ten minutes to muster the courage to jump out of my car, and ask a pale looking deputy what was going on. 

I tried to jump over the yellow tape, only to be politely pulled back. 

“Carbon monoxide poisoning,” the deputy told me. 

“The whole family is dead.” he sighed. “Mom, Dad, and their daughter in college.” 

I think he was trying to be sympathetic, awkwardly patting me. But I was already on my knees, all of the breath dragged from my lungs. “Luckily, it's just like going to sleep. Monoxide is a silent killer.”

*Monoxide is a silent killer.*

Was that the same as, *“I'm sorry. Ben was in the wrong place at the wrong time.”*

And, *“Alex was silently suffering. He did what he thought was best.”*

I didn't go to Esme’s funeral. Mom and Dad and Will had already forgotten her, just like the others. What I did do, several days later, when her name wasn't even a memory anymore– I bought flowers from the store. Roses were Esme’s favourite. 

The seller was around my Mom’s age, a plump looking woman wearing a floral dress, long red hair tied into a ponytail. 

She was on her phone, humming to a tune on the radio. 

*The Smiths*. 

“I hope she likes them.”  The woman said, wrapping the flowers in red ribbons. 

She had a strong southern accent that immediately annoyed me. 

I took the roses, stuffing them in my bag. “What did you say?”

The seller cocked her head. “Hmm?”

“How did you know they were for my girlfriend?”

The woman sighed, placing her phone on the counter. I glanced at whatever she'd been so interested in, but the screen was faced down. “Esme came in here a lot,” Her lips broke out into a sad, sympathetic smile. I was quickly growing sick of them. 

“Esme. She, uh, she told me you guys were dating. Esme was always buying roses for her room. Sometimes she would stand in here for hours, and just stare at flowers. I think she found comfort in them.” 

The woman sighed, fixing me with what I could only describe as a pitiful pout. 

Urgh. 

“I hope you can find the same comfort,” she murmured. The seller handed me an extra rose, and I found myself reaching out for it, my eyes stinging. Fuck. 

I hadn't cracked in at least fifteen hours, and that was a record. 

But now I could feel myself splintering, tears trickling down my cheeks. 

The Flower lady squeezed my hand. “I’m sorry, sweetheart. If it makes you feel better, it's just like going to sleep. Monoxide is a silent killer.” 

Her words were familiar. 

Exactly what the deputy said. Before I could speak, she dumped weed killer on the counter. “Did you know our plant killer is ten dollars ninety nine?” 

Her sudden bout of energy took me off guard. 

I tried to smile. “I don't want any plant killer.”

The seller nodded, handing me another rose. “Oh, of course, Darling! But it is five ninety nine! Just for today!”

Something pricked me, and I hissed out, wafting my hand. 

Damn thorns. I could already see a single spot of blood. 

I nodded, sucking my teeth against a cry. “Thanks. But I'll skip it this time.”

I took the roses to what used to be Esme’s grave. Now, it was an empty headstone with no name, no memories, no flowers, nothing. Just like Alex and Ben, Esme had been reduced to dirt under my feet. I stayed at her ‘grave’ for a long time, long enough for the sky to grow dark, and my thoughts darker. 

I tried to find a logical explanation for the sudden deaths of the people I got close to, but all I could think of was a curse. 

So, I started googling curses, leaning against Esme’s headstone, my knees to my chest. Had I *been* cursed? 

Was my family cursed? 

According to Google, a cursed object connected with the curse itself. 

Which could be anything. Though I didn't remember visiting any ancient ruins, or an old church. With zero answers, I headed home. I passed a guy playing The Smiths in his car. Then a group of older  women wearing ripped fishnets. 

Esme was following me. Just like Alex’s smell. Fresh coffee and rich chocolate. 

Ben’s cologne filled my car last summer. His favourite band was playing all day on our local music station. 

I drove around with no destination, listening to each one on repeat, until I was losing him all over again. 

The sweet aroma of flowers followed me all the way home, and I was tipsy on the smell, when I found myself face to face with a boy. Under the overexposed streetlight, this guy was almost ethereal, thick brown hair and freckles. 

He reminded me of Ben. Which wasn't fair. I thought I was hallucinating him, before he came closer, bleeding from the shadow. I saw more of him, white strips of something wrapped around his head. 

*Wrong*. 

The word slammed into me when I glimpsed his clothes. Filthy. 

The guy was wearing a white button down, a single streak of bright red ingrained into the material. His white pants were torn, glued to his legs. 

He was barefoot, the soles of his feet slapping on wet concrete. 

I didn't realize he was in front of me, nose to nose, until he shoved me. Hard. 

“Josie.” His voice was a whimper, despite his narrowed eyes, his lips twisted into a scowl. 

He was crying. 

The boy shoved me again, and I staggered. 

His ice cold breath grazed my cheeks. “What the *fuck* did you do to my sister?”

“Sister?” I whispered. 

Something wet landed on my cheek, suddenly. 

Rain. 

I wasn't expecting a downpour. The weather was forecasted to be clear. 

To my surprise, the guy let out a harsh sounding laugh. The two of us were slowly getting drenched, but neither of us were making a move to get out of the rain. My hair was glued to the back of my neck, my clothes sticking to me. 

But somehow, I wanted to stay in the rain. It was refreshing. 

When a thought hit me, telling me to *get out* of the rain, it was shoved to the back of my mind. The guy spat water out of his mouth, shaking his head like a dog. 

“Of course,” he muttered, “Drown me out with the rain.”

I found my voice, my gaze glued to intense red seeping through the bandage stapled to his head. He looked like he’d escaped an emergency room. “I don't know anyone  called Josie,” I said, “I think you've got the wrong person.”

The guy’s eyes narrowed. He stepped closer, grabbing my shoulders, and I noticed how hollow his eyes were, empty caverns carved into his skull. 

Eyes are the windows to the soul, and this guy was completely soulless. 

“I'm only going to say this once,” he whispered, “What did you do to my sister?”

Before I could respond, the guy was being violently grabbed, and dragged back. 

Figures who appeared seemingly out of nowhere. 

“Let me go!” He cried out, struggling. “You fucking assholes! Let me go!”

His screaming became muffling, when his cries were gagged.

“You promised!” He yelled, his cries collapsing into a sob. 

“You said if you took me, she wouldn't get hurt! So, where is she?” he met my gaze, his expression crumpling, something inside him coming apart, splintering by the seams. 

“You can't take *both* of us, this wasn't in the agreement!” 

When he was dragged further back, I noticed a car parked at the side of the road. 

The boy was pulled inside. At first, he refused, before an extra pair of hands shoved him. “You fucking– *mmmphmmhphmmm*!”

I heard his fists slamming into the windows. 

“Don't take me back there! Please! Just let Josie–” 

His cries once again collapsed into angry muffle screaming, and I felt my hands moving towards my pocket for my phone. 

This was a kidnapping, right? I was witnessing a kidnapping in broad fucking daylight. 

A shadow was suddenly in front of me, and I jumped, tearing my eyes from the car. Jasper, my colleague. He was still wearing his apron, and to my confusion, was swinging a carton of whole milk. 

“Sorry, Bree,” He winked, speaking in a  single breath. “As you can see, our friend here had a *little* too much to drink.”

I nodded, craning my neck. Jasper stepped in front of me, maintaining a grin. 

“Who is he?” This time, I side-stepped away from him, only for him to copy. 

“Just a... guy.” He said. “As you can see, he's a little…” Jasper prodded his right temple. “Let's just say he's got a few too many screws loose.” Jasper laughed, staying stock still, blocking my way. 

When I made a move to counter him, he stepped in front of me, his eyes hardening. “I heard he lost his family a while ago in a…” He pretended to think. “Oh, yeah, a car crash. Maybe a gas explosion, I’m not really sure.” 

I could hear the car behind him, and once again I tried to dart past him. But he was quick to block my way. He was getting closer to me, very subtly backing me in the opposite direction. 

“Anyway, this guy is kiiiiind of nuts. Dude still thinks he's got a sister.”

When I lost patience and shoved him out of the way, the car, and the guy, was gone. 

“See?” Jasper rolled his eyes. He was still holding milk from work. My head spun. 

It was 8pm, we were in a suburban neighborhood, and Jasper was holding half a pint of milk. His apron was stained with coffee, and when I really *looked* at him, I realized he was out of breath. 

He was doing a good job of hiding it, exhaling in intervals, swiping at his forehead to clear sweat. 

When I noticed, he pretended to run his hands through his hair. 

“I, uh, I feel for him! Like, I'm sorry his family died, or whatever, but attacking random girls isn't cool, y’know?” Jasper handed me the carton.

""Milk?"" 

Instead of replying, I stumbled home. It was sunny. 

At 8pm.

And when I took notice, I wasn't even wet. 

Esme was my last straw. I made a promise to myself to not get close to anyone. 

The guys and girls I met were friends, and nothing more. Weirdly enough, the only guy I was getting close to was my colleague. I don't know if it was brain damage, or I was finally losing the plot. 

But Jasper’s shameless cruelty towards customers, and that quirk in his lips when he made them cry, was kind of hot. 

However, he was playing hard to get. 

And I mean REALLY playing. 

I was in storage trying to find vegan milk, and he was suddenly a fucking expert, spewing milk facts. 

When I slammed the refrigerator door shut, he was inches from my face. 

In the dim light from a single spluttering bulb, his eyes reminded me of coffee grounds. I thought maybe he was going to kiss me, judging from his softening expression. I felt his hands go around my waist, and I felt myself immediately melt. 

I don't know what came over me. It's like, one minute I hated him, and the next… I was suddenly hot. Really hot. And I really wanted to take my clothes off. I thought that's what he wanted to do too. 

I mean, his gaze followed mine, piercing, fingers playing with the buttons on his shirt. Before he leaned forward, his breath in my face. 

“Did you know that Mulberry Farms is an award winning brand of milk in our town and ONLY our town? Mulberry farms was bred and made right here.""

And suddenly, I was no longer hot and bothered. 

“I didn't.” I said, ducking into a crouch to search the shelves. “Have you seen our vegan milk? We did have some.”

“Three *time* winner,” Jasper continued. When I jumped up, he stepped closer, and I felt my cheeks spark. His smile was rare. In fact, Jasper was only smiling when he was talking about *milk*. 

“Mulberry Farms have the best pasturization. It's suitable for everything! Coffee, cereal, or maybe you just want a glass of fresh milk to yourself! Perfect for kids, too! Breakfast time *is* Mulberry Farms.”

“Are you having a stroke?” I whisper-shrieked. 

“Nope!” 

Jasper twisted around, shooting me a grin. ""Aren't we going to fuck?"" 

""You wish.""

I left the storage, however, with butterflies in my gut. 

There was no way I was falling for my asshole colleague. 

Somehow, though, I was. 

Just standing next to him filled me with electricity. 

The way he talked down to customers, insulting me to my face… I was thoroughly, and disgustingly, in love. 

I tried to stop myself. 

I showered in ice cold water. 

I ate (choked on) a ghost pepper. 

I even asked my BROTHER for advice, who told me to go for it. 

I told him Jasper had one (of several) flaws, but this particular one was off-putting. 

“He’s obsessed with milk.” I told my brother. 

Harry lifted a brow. “Is that a euphemism, or…”

He paused, for way longer than necessary. “So, your would-be-boyfriend has a milk fetish?”

I left his room before he could take that conversation further. 

I wanted to say Jasper was the only one who acted weird. 

But over the next few weeks, I noticed it in quite a few people. 

I was having breakfast with Mom, and she lifted up the box. 

“Choco Flakes.” She blurted, “Aren't they just the best?”

I nodded slowly. “Yeah, Mom. They're great.”

I prodded the box with a smile. “Only a dollar ninety nine.”

There were so many townspeople on their phones. They walked around with groceries or briefcases, their eyes glued to whatever they were swiping through. 

I was serving an old woman, when I caught her phone screen. 

I could have sworn there was an image of Jasper. 

She swiped right, and I had a hard time looking her in the eye. 

The woman was at least in her 80’s. And I'm talking, can barely walk, and needs assistance. 

Was she seriously hitting up 25 year old guys? 

Walking home, *everyone* was on their phones. 

I stopped at a crossing, stabbing the red light. 

It started to snow the second I stepped out onto the road, white flakes dancing in front of me. It didn't even cross my mind that it was almost June. The snow was pretty, accumulating on the ground. 

“Oh shit, sorry!”

Lifting my head, a guy was standing in front of me holding an umbrella. 

I knew him. 

But not from whatever was trying to pollute my mind. 

I knew him from a while ago. I knew him from the rain. I knew the bloody bandages wrapped around his head, and soulless, seething eyes I couldn't understand. It was the boy who was dragged away three months prior. 

He looked different, his hair was shorter, his face carved into a thing of beauty. 

The white strips of gauze bleeding scarlet were gone, his filthy clothes replaced with a white shirt and pants, a trench coat flung over the top. I didn't remember him being this handsome. His dark brown hair had been tamed and curled. 

It was his expression that sent shivers sliding down my spine. 

His too wide smile and unblinking eyes made me suddenly conscious of two bright lights on the two of us. 

So bright.

Something shattered in my mind, and I was aware of a lot of things. 

The snow under my feet was *too* soft. 

I glimpsed a single streak of red seeping from his nose, his hands trembling around a takeout coffee cup. 

Behind me, people were staring. I could see a group of teenage girls giggling. 

“It's him,” one of them squeaked. “It's the new love interest!”

“Bree?” His grin widened, snowflakes prancing around us. His teeth gritted together. I could tell he hated every word. “Holy shit, long time no see!”

He held out his hand, and I could see visible pain contorting in his eyes. 

*Help me.* He was screaming through a twinkling smile. 

“Don't you remember me? It's… it's uh, it's Sam!” he laughed. “From eighth grade!”

The lights blinked out, and the thought crashed into my mind. Static images filling my head. I shook them away. 

Oh, yeah, it *was* Sam. 

My childhood friend. 

 But I didn't reply. Instead of saying, “Sam? It's been so long!” I found myself walking, stumbling over to the girls. 

Who were rapidly swiping left on their phones. 

“What's that?” I demanded in a sharp breath. 

I grabbed for the phone, only for Sam to step in front of me. He settled me with a smile. 

Behind me, one of the girls fainted. 

Sam’s smile didn't waver. Though he did side-eye the girl being carried away. “Why don't I take you out for coffee?”

Apparently, *coffee* was the code word for hooking up. 

Sam dragged me into the nearest coffee store, straight to the bathroom. 

When he shoved me into a stall, I didn't know what to say. 

“Take off your shoes,” he said in a hiss, and after hesitating, I did. 

Sam pulled off his jacket, shook snow out of his hair, and got real close. 

“Look up.” He murmured. 

I did, my gaze finding the ceiling. 

“To your right, a camera is very well hidden, but can be seen with the naked eye if you catch what looks like a red laser,” Sam said. 

“To your left, another camera, as well as a vent that is currently pumping the stalls with aphrodisiacs. And right now, we are in the red zone. Meaning, you should be conscious.”

He prodded me, and I flinched. 

“Mostly conscious.”

His words went right over my head, my mind was foggy. 

I couldn't think straight.

I think I asked him what he was saying, but my mouth was filled with cotton. 

“Snap out of it,” he said, “Like I said, they're *making* you feel like this.”

He shoved me against the door, which broke me out of my trance. Slightly. 

“I hate what I'm going to say right now,” Sam groaned, tipping his head back. 

He was sweating, I noticed. 

Bad. I glimpsed beads of red pooling down his neck. He noticed me staring. 

“I'm okay, for now. I’m faulty, so the connection is severed. He squeezed his eyes shut. “I…think.”

“What are you talking about?”

“Sex.” He said, blinking rapidly. I wasn't going to comment on his slurring voice. 

Sam stumbled, fresh blood dripping from his nose. 

“We need to duhhhh the sex. Like…” His eyes rolled into the back of his head, but he managed to stabilise himself. “Nooooow.”

“What?!”

“Is everything okay in there?” 

The voice was a woman. She knocked on the stall. 

Sam’s eyes widened, coming back to life a little. “They're paranoid,” he whispered. When I could only stare at him, he pounded his fists into the door. 

“They think we’re fucking,” he hissed, “So, we need to make it believable.”

*“They?”* I mouthed. 

He didn't reply, swiping at his haemorrhaging nose. “Just… move around against the door. That'll fool ‘em.”

I did, doing my best to shuffle around, slamming my back against the lock.

When the metal clanged, he shot me a look. “I said sex!” He hissed, “Not murder!” 

Sam jumped onto the toilet bowl. There was an open window above him. 

*“That's enough.”* He mouthed, hoisting his way through. 

He helped me through, and I expected to land on concrete. 

What I did land on, however, was something… squishy. 

Something wet sliding between my bare toes. 

Looking closer, I recognised the beaded anklet. 

Fishnet tights. 

Something animalistic clawed from my throat. I was standing on Esme. Or what was *left* of Esme. She was just a torso and legs, the rest of her ripped away like doll pieces. I couldn't see her face. 

I looked for it, digging through what could only be old flesh and pieces of limbs. 

I felt suffocated. I grabbed half of Ben’s face that had been ripped off, and then Alex’s tattooed arm. 

There was so *much* of them, piles and piles of the same heads, the same filthy and rotting clothes. I was screaming by the time I shuffled back on my hands and knees, trying to wipe them off of my skin. 

They were all over me, staining me, painting me. 

Sam’s hand slick with blood gently covered my mouth. 

“Stay calm, all right?” He whispered. “I would tell you everything is going to be okay, but the truth is, it's really *not*, there's like, a 99.9% chance you're going to… understandably freak out.”

He pulled me to my feet, letting out a heavy breath. 

Blinking rapidly, I could only see… pieces. 

Pieces of *people*. 

Legs and heads and torsos all piled into one mass of gore. 

“We’ve got maybe five minutes before they realize we’re not doing the devil's dance,” Sam sniffled, “Maybe ten, before my brain short circuits and I bleed out.”

I didn't know I was hyperventilating, until I couldn't fucking breathe. 

Closer towards the door, and I could hear… machinery. 

I couldn't stop myself. Even when I was aware I was standing in congealing blood. 

Rotten bodies. 

The dim light led me into what could only be described as a factory. There were three levels, and we were on the highest. 

Sam stepped forward, gripping the metal bar in front of us. I felt my legs buckling, a thick, pukey slime filling my mouth. 

“Soo, I guess it all started when Brianna Timberman was seventeen years old, and rejected by her childhood best friend, Sam Thwaites.”

Sam’s words collapsed into a low buzzing in my ear. 

All I could see was a conveyer belt, filled with… people. 

Boys. 

Girls.

But most noticeably, Ben’s, Alex’s, Esme’s, and *Sam’s.*

But they start as Ben’s, Alex's, and Esme’s. 

I could see regular people, their hair stripped away. 

Their skin sliced into, cruelly moulding them into the exact same four faces. 

When a large looming needle plunged into the back of an Alex’s head, I couldn't *not* watch. I waited for the guy to wake up, but I don't even think he was alive. 

He stood, unblinking, letting this thing twist and contort his face. 

And it was then, when I realized these things weren't even human. 

I could see the mechanics built under their flesh, both living tissue and metal melded together. 

“Brianna’s father, who is a liiiitle on the crazy side, with too much cash and not not enough logic, took his daughter’s rejection a little *too* personally,” Sam continued. 

“So, he promised his daughter he would find her the perfect match.”

I started to speak, the words coming out before I could stop them. 

“My father would never–”

“I didn't say it was *your* father,” Sam said. His eyes darkened. 

“Anyway, as I was saying, the townspeople became unhealthily obsessed with who Brianna would choose.""

He sighed. ""So obsessed, in fact, that the girl’s day to day life was broadcasted across town, while her potential love interests were ranked, week after week. Think of it like the Truman Show mixed with matchmaker. First, there was Ben.”

Sam’s smile thinned. “Her high school boyfriend.”

Sam shrugged. “She grew bored of him. Also, he kinda did something unforgivable.”

He continued. “Then… Alex. She liked him, but sometimes, he was a little too unserious. The guy was a clown.”

I backed away, but he was quick to grab my shoulders. 

“Finally? Esme. Who she truly fell for.”

I swallowed. “Esme is–”

He cut me off. “But I didn't mention that they hurt her, did I?” 

Sam leaned against the bar. Behind him, I could see a figure in white pushing a gurney with a Ben strapped to it. 

“Ben tried to assault her, insisting she *wanted* it. Alex dumped her on her birthday. Esme ended their relationship with a one word text. *Goodbye*.”

Sam mimed an explosion. “That was the nail in the coffin.”

I caught blood sliding down his nose. “You're still bleeding.” 

Sam gingerly prodded his nose. 

“Urgh. Yeah, it's an effect of the severing. I've been in the red zone too long. I should probably speed this up.”

He talked faster, his voice collapsing into a mumbled slur. 

“Brianna couldn't take it. Her best friend was ignoring her. Everyone she had fallen in love with hurt her. Esme wasn't returning her calls. Ben was sleeping around right in front of her, and Alex was still being a clown. Brianna’s poor parents found her hanging from her bedroom ceiling fan.”

I shook my head, my thoughts screaming. 

“No–”

He held a finger up to shush me. “Let me talk. Jeez.”

Sam folded his arms. “A grieving father would do anything to avenge his dead child, buuut… Mr Timberman took ‘finding a perfect match’ and ‘the show must go on’ a little bit too literally.”

His sickly smile found me. 

“The town wanted more of Brianna, and her life, so he turned his daughter’s failed love life into a town wide TV show, sending the entire teen populace into here,” he gestured around him. 

“To make the *perfect* suitors. Who *wouldn't* hurt his *new* Brianna.”

Something ice cold crept down my spine. 

He cleared his throat. “Mr Timberman grew, let's say, obsessed, with getting revenge on these specific four people. So, he started killing them–” He coughed. 

“Sorry. Us. Killing us for the funny ha-ha, ‘Look at how many times I can fuck with them!’ bit. And then recycling us into someone completely different.""

""Our names are gone. Then our personalities. Finally, our bodies ripped to pieces and sculpted into Brianna’s exes.” Sam poked me in the cheek. 

“The cycle continues. They reset your ticker and the town eats it up. They can bring back Esme, Ben, and Alex whenever they want and add curveballs.""

""Like the *bad-boy* colleague who becomes the fan favorite.” Sam’s lips curved. “For… some fucking reason.”

His eyes flickered open. “However, Brianna will never find a suitor because her father is a fucking  sociopath. To him and the town, his dead daughter’s pathetic love life is entertainment.”

He held out his arm. 

“See?”

I tried really hard not to look through the makeup. 

At noticeable skin grafts. 

“I was a Ben.” He said. “Then I was an Alex, and *then* I was an extra.” His eyes found mine, sad, suddenly. “But who I was originally is kinda gone. All I remember is a deal to protect Josie. I gave myself up so they wouldn't take her.”

“Your sister.” I said. 

Sam nodded. 

His earlier words hit me. He was talking like Brianna Timberman was dead. 

But *I* was Brianna Timberman. 

I was rejected by Sam, yes, but I found Ben. 

As if he could read my mind, Sam shook his head. 

“Look at yourself.” He said, his voice shaking. 

“And I mean *really* look at yourself.” 

Sam stepped closer. 

“Because, underneath all of that make-up and the prosthetics and surgery, and fucked up memories, you're just another recycled lump of flesh.”

He prodded my temple. “Who *thinks* she is Brianna Timberman.”

His voice was slurring again, a fresh stream of scarlet seeping down his chin. 

“Don't you want to know?” His eyes rolled to pearly whites. 

Before he could finish his sentence, Sam dropped to the ground. 

I remember warm arms grasping hold of me. 

Shadows with no faces. 

They pricked me twice in the back of my neck. 

A familiar voice in my ear, almost a hiss. 

*Jasper*. 

“You are the *worst* fucking Brianna.” He murmured. ""Like, dude, it's *painful* to be with you.""*

When I came to, I was standing up, somehow. 

At *work*.

**I am Brianna Timberman.**

The thought floated around in my head, my memory hazy. 

“Hello?!”

A man was waving his hands in front of me. 

“I asked for iced coffee, lady!”

Jasper was serving another customer. “Bree, wake the fuck up.”

They were trying to make me think I was hallucinating. 

Which was crazy, because my fingernails were still tinted with Sam’s blood. 

The marks he'd left on my wrist when he was yanking me, were still there. 

Bruised on my arm. 

“Bree!” Jasper snapped. “Snap out of it and make the dude his drink.”

“Right.”

The word slipped out of my mouth.

He caught my eye, winking, and Brianna Timberman internally squeaked. 

I half wondered what he was. Was he recycled, or an unwilling performer?

Throughout the day, I was fully aware my words were not mine. 

Like I was on autopilot. 

But not just that. 

My *thoughts* weren't mine, either.

I spent half of my shift staring at my colleague’s biceps. 

During my break, I went into the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror. 

I *am* Brianna Timberman. 

But even when I told myself that, my eyes were too blue.

My smile was too perfect. 

My teeth. 

Too white. 

My shaking hands prodded at my face, at someone else's face. 

So many faces, so many skin grafts. 

The thought was violent, sending tremors through me. 

How many people was I *wearing*? 

I started to claw at my arms and legs, my face. 

How many fucking people had I been? 

I grabbed a knife and tried to slice at my face.

 But there was no blood. 

How could there be no blood?!

When I got home, I found my family waiting for me. 

Mom, Dad and Harry, all of them beaming. 

“Bree!” Mom stood up, her lips stretching into a grin. 

My mouth was already moving, but they were not my words. 

“Mom!” 

I didn't know why she was smiling so much, until I saw Sam sitting at our dining room table. His smile was too big. 

His over-expensive shirt and pants did not suit him, and looked fucking gross, but somehow my brain thought it was hot. The worst part is, I couldn't and still can't tell which Sam he was. 

Was he the guy who told me the horrific reality of my existence? 

Or was he another recycled, mindless suitor? 

“This is Samuel.” Mom said, and Sam slowly stood. 

He took slow steps towards me, and kissed my hand.

I saw the slightest smudge of scarlet on his lip, but his eyes were blank. 

In the corner of my eye, my ‘father’s’ eyes were glittering. 

“Hello, Brianna.” Sam said, and I *swore* Now that I was awake, the walls were wolf-whistling. Laughing.

1nszm4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1nszm4a/is_it_healthy_not_to_message_in_between_dates/,Is it healthy not to message in between dates?,"I (32F) had a tumultuous time with dating through my twenties. I became used to hearing trauma dumping on first dates, being love bombed, kisses on first dates, dates that last for several hours, constant messaging in between dates, wanting to keep things casual forever, etc. The men would eventually withdraw and prove themselves to be emotionally unavailable. I was aware of my patterns but I kept falling into them.

Over the last year, I've taken a break from dating, and have been doing EMDR and intensive nervous system work to release the trauma that's led me to the aforementioned situations. I returned to dating apps and felt pleased to see that I was matching with a very different category of men, and that the type of men I would've swiped right on before made my nervous system belch.

In the last week, I've been on dates with two different guys (34M and 31M). They were both really nice. We had coffee then left after a couple of hours. There was no trauma dumping, no love bombing, no kissing. It was refreshing. We talked about our life stories, our interests, our hobbies, what we were looking for, etc. They didn't squirm when I said I'm looking for something serious. At the end of the dates, they both said they'd had a great time and asked to see me again straight away. They've only messaged me to arrange the next date.

I'm not upset by it but I am confused. Is this normal for an emotionally healthy person, not to message or check in in between dates? Not even a, ""Hey, how's your day going?"" every couple of days?",8,1759093417.0,dating,13,0.83,False

I work in the accounting department for a long-standing legal drama in the film industry.

A coworker of mine has been dead set on establishing an HR case against our supervisor since 2023 because she was not promoted. She has openly admitted to intentionally trying to provoke our supervisor (e.g., ignoring communications to later claim harassment, not following directions, excessive fraternization and time away from her desk) and even stated she planned to give our then pregnant supervisor non-decaf coffee to cause harm to her pregnancy. I have made it clear I do not want to be involved, but I now feel targeted because of my stance.

The situation escalated when our supervisor went on maternity leave in July 2025. Her temporary replacement is a close friend of the problem coworker. Since then, I've been subjected to micromanagement, an unreasonable increase in workload, and public reprimands for work done correctly. I have also experienced racially charged and sexually inappropriate interactions with both the coworker and the interim boss. 

I participated in an HR investigation (August to mid-September) stemming from my coworker's complaints about our interim supervisor. I raised concerns about my coworker and the interim boss, and HR assured me they would be addressed. The investigation concluded while I was away during a planned vacation earlier this month.

This past Friday, my department head called me into his office after he'd had a private meeting with my interim boss and stated I ""didn't seem like I liked the job anymore."" This was entirely unexpected. When I asked for an explanation, he repeated the statement and vaguely mentioned ""maybe some work wasn't getting done on time,"" but could not specify what work he was referring to.

This situation just feels as though it has gotten entirely too personal and like I have now made myself a target based on seeking involvement from HR. It feels like I am being retaliated against, but I am just really not sure where I stand in terms of legal options since I have not yet been fired or anything like that. It does not help that my coworker has been making repeated statements about my department potentially being downsized by one person.

Ghost Dragon

Race: Menmade

Height (From ghost tail to head) - 5,4 meters.

A sleazy and careless dragon in charge of his lair which resembles a haunted school.
He always sends out his opponents on fetch quests around his place first, not because he wants to test them but because he wants to stall them so he can read more of his comic books.

Most of the time he doesn't even listen to what the challengers are saying, responding “Uh huh” to just about anything, and if they talk enough, he gets annoyed and finally accepts the invitation to battle, though not before quickly finishing a chapter of the book he's reading.

He often sends letters to the Ice Dragon, Metelges Steklon, these envelopes are often filled with notes, photos from Kawakuro, or coffee beans.
One of the letters actually got lost during travel, and upon being found by an anonymous traveler, it was revealed that the message inside was a haiku poem, a passionate one at that.

His additude and attire are one of the main reasons why he developed an active community online, which is mostly comprised of young women and dragon fanatics.
His face even appeared on candy packages and drinks, and he quite enjoys the attention.

This dragon's eats pretty much junk food only, when asked about his poor diet, Kawakuro replied:
“I'm a ghost, duh! It's not like there is any danger to stuffing myself with the good stuff!”.
It is often joked that his eating habits are the reason why he's a ghost in the first place.

1st. 3rd floor: Truly the best floor. Book wise it has a selection of enclyopedias and a decent selection contemporary fiction. Not only that it has an active collection of periodical magazines! Past that, this floor has puzzles and board games. As well, the study rooms here are great, the look of the floor is great, and the views from the windows are spectacular. The stained glass window in just the cherry on top. Truly the perfect library floor


2nd. 1st Floor: Widest selection of books outside the ARC. So much classic lit, foreign lit, biographies, encyclopedias and research information. Not only that, this floor is home to a wide selection of highly detailed maps, a cd collection, microfilm, microfiche, and a humongous amount of US government documents. Past that, great selection fo study rooms, a meeting room for clubs, and good selection of seeming. The only thing knocking this down is the lack of windows on this floor. I truly feel like i’m in a basement down here


3rd. 2nd Floor: The main entrance floor! Utility wise, this is where you print, check out materials and check out technology! The technology lending here is seriously underrated. You can get some good cameras for free! As well, here there is a shockingly good selection of new books. I’ve read a few great non fiction books here about us politics/history. Furthermore, this floor is home to a selection of Art History books which are a fun flick around. Moving on, this floor also is home to the newspapers. Sometimes I do check out the free papers here and I’m very happy we have it. All from good publishing companies like the NYT, WP, and Orlando Sentinel. Bernie’s coffee is also here! I’m not a huge coffee drinker, but i’m happy it’s here. The only thing that knocks this down is the fact that it saves time if you walk through the library. Which I do like when i’m in rush, but I hate when i’m actually trying to do any sort of studying here. Very nice floor to be around at night, though during the day? I wouldn’t try to study here. 


4th. 4th floor: The newest floor! The lack of books here seriously knock this floor down a few. And for a new floor, i’m surprised there isn’t more study rooms. Still a solid floor, just honestly not much going on to make this floor feel special. The greatest thing about this room is the reading room. I adore the reading room I feel like i’m in some old timey movie set in a college. I loveeeee the chairs here. But really past that, there is nothing about this floor that is too special. I wish I liked this floor more.


5th. 5th Floor: The silent floor! I don’t really like it! There is nothing much here. No balcony access unfortunately, and the only notable thing here is the Special collections room. Which in all honesty is an awesome place, but the fact you have to make an appointment and the lack of hours severely hinders the wonder of looking at old books. The only thing special here is how it is completely silent. And I don’t like it. I don’t know, it’s just too quiet it drives me crazy. The view could save this floor, however the windows are slightly tinted which bugs me when i’m trying to look out of it at night.  Also the floor is the smallest, which also means only two of the elevators bring you here, and the main staircase doesn’t take you up here. Kind of bugs me! The only floor I never really spend anytime in </3",3,1759092204.0,ucf,1,1.0,False

I think the font in the last picture might be a better fit\[1\]. But do you think the name and branding works? Never done anything like this before but wanted a good idea of what I want before approaching  a designer for hire.

FWIW I'm rebranding my existing mushroom farm into two distinct parts, a B2B company for mycology stuff\[2\] and B2C for consumer packaged goods, so far 'Mana' is the name I like most for it as it doesn't limit me to mushrooms and has energy associations. The mycology company's logo is similar to the first image, but only the three mushrooms, no coffee cup\[3\] - I like the idea of keeping them loosely associated like that.

\[1\]: I don't want to lean into the hippy vibe too much so thought the NASA font sorta balanced that out and made it more science-y but maybe it makes it too clinical.

\[2,3\]: The mycology company is intended to be branded as clean and scientific, with a no-frills name FWIW, here's the logo: [https://imgur.com/a/BxHBjWO](https://imgur.com/a/BxHBjWO) \- please note they are distinct companies with separate websites.

Distance isn’t an issue so anywhere in the park is great 

- Stores: are they typically closed the days leading up to/after Thanksgiving? Primarily Main Street (bonus points for a good coffee shop and if anyone knows if the bookstore on main will be open) 
- Food options: are there any places that might be open for an alternative place for myself and perhaps one or other people to grab food on Thanksgiving at? I know Stewart’s is around and have no issue grabbing something hot from there but would love to support a local business if open :) 
- How much snow is traditionally on the ground by that time of year? Driving in the snow isn’t an issue and I have emergency gear in my car just in case 

Thanks all! If there is somewhere better for me to post please let me know, this is pretty much my only social media

Hi! I am on the hunt for a coffee table to replace my current one (Marcio Display Table from West Elm) because I’ve had it with the constant kitty paw prints on the glass 🐾

I have a few selections (listed below) but I found my PERFECT replacement table (Jaxon coffee table in walnut from Ella+Ross) and it is unfortunately from a Canadian company that doesn’t ship to the US. I’ve reverse image searched it on Google, Amazon, Wayfair and can’t find anything like it in the same style (I’ve seen burl wood or a natural farmhouse style wood - both do not match my style). Does anyone have any recommendations?! 

Some of the features I’m looking for:
- warm-toned Walnut (or Acorn) color
- mid-century / postmodern style with curves/rounded features/clean lines to match the rest of my furniture
- length ideally below 46” (max 50”)
- height below 17-17.5” max 
- ideally mostly solid wood but not opposed if the style is right 
- under $800 (preferably <$500) 
- ships to NYC/USA! 

Some of my other selections:
- Melli Coffee Table 36” (West Elm)
- Retro Tripod Coffee Table (West Elm)
- Calgary Coffee Table 44” (West Elm)
- Calla Coffee Table 30” (West Elm)
- Latisia 41” Wide Solid Wood Coffee Table (George Oliver/Wayfair)
- Saint Mossi Modern Coffee Table Oval (SM Saint Mossi/Amazon) I actually love this one but HATE the black legs so lmk if anyone has a reco for how to possibly change those? 

Not sure if Google is just pushing me to West Elm but that is where I found the most options. Very open to any and all recommendations!

Pleaaase help! Thanks in advance!

1nsyrv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/1nsyrv1/did_i_miss_my_chance_or_was_there_never_any/,Did I miss my chance or was there never any?,"This is something I’ve been wondering about for a while now. It’s about a girl I met at work a while ago. It’s a long story but I’ll try to keep it short. 

So a couple of years ago I got a new job and I met the above mentioned girl there. She was the first person I met there and basically my mentor, showing me around and stuff. We spent lots and lots of time together and since our work was often uneventful we talked a lot. 

The more I got to know her, the more I fell for her. I was looking forward to each day at work solely cause I knew I’d get to see her. I’d randomly give her compliments, buy her coffee, gave her my jacket when she was cold, or get her a fav sweet treat, or I’d offer a listening ear when she had a tough day. Not because of some master plan of winning her heart but just cause I’d want to see her happy. And she’d often return the favour. She’d show genuine interest in my life, buy me a coffee in return and one time even treat a minor wound I got while working. We had a similar sense of humour, taste in books music and films. We could always find a topic to talk about. I’d walk her to the bus stop after each shift and we’d always say to each other it was nice seeing you and then we’d hug. I haven’t felt so close to another person before or since then. 

Long story short I totally fell for her and after some months I asked her out. We went for a couple of drinks and I thought it went good, and from what she said at the time I thought she enjoyed herself too. After the date she herself was positive about us hanging out again to finish all the topics we didn’t have time for during the date. 

I asked her out a couple of times afterwards and while she was always positive about going, it just never happened as she always had a reason why she couldn’t go. At the time i brushed it off cause during one of our talks i learned that she loves when a guy tries to win a girl over, cause it’s what men should do, in her opinion. She also told me it’s been ages since man told her she liked her directly (at that moment I was on the brink of doing so but ultimately held back). But after I while I dropped the topic of asking her out since she was seemingly always busy. But at thr same time she continued to talk with me, showing interest just like before. At no point she mentioned a boyfriend, or being happy by herself, or me not being her type. Or generally acting disinterested, nothing like that.

Ultimately she left the job after some disagreement with the management. At that point we worked different shifts and didn’t see each other at work at all. So when I learned she was quitting I texted her one last time asking if she was interested to grab a coffee or something. She never replied. We remained friends on socials and recently she liked my pic which got me thinking about her again. 

Looking back I wish I got some proper closure on it all. I keep thinking whether I could have done something differently or whether things were going nowhere from the beginning. One thing I keep beating myself about is that I never directly told her I liked her, something she explicitly told me once that she hasn’t  experienced in a while. On the other hand, I feel like she must have known that I was into her, from the way I acted towards her. 

So this is the whole long short story, I’d appreciate an outsiders perspective on this whole thing. Did I have a chance and missed it or was there never any in the first place?",6,1759091378.0,SeriousConversation,4,1.0,False
1nsyqls,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nsyqls,Qwen Image vs Hunyuan 80B,"Ordered Hunyuan then Qwen, using some early Qwen image tests.  Not perfect test since the Hunyuans are square and Qwen are widescreen.  For the last pair, both are square and the Qwen one is 1536x1536.

  
Used this for Hunyuan 80B: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/HunyuanImage-3.0](https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/HunyuanImage-3.0)  which generates 1024x1024 fixed.

The Qwen images are from my own system (RTX 6000 Blackwell) using reference code, no quants, attn shortcuts, or lightning anything, generated when Qwen Image was first released.  I'll assume [fal.ai](http://fal.ai) knows what they're doing and is reference as well.  I wasn't able to get Hunyuan to run with bnb 4 bit quick quant to fit into vram, hopefully GGUF is coming soon.

Prompts (generated with Gemini prompted to include some text elements and otherwise variety of artistic styles and content):

  
An elegant Art Nouveau poster in the style of Alphonse Mucha. It features a beautiful woman with long, flowing hair intertwined with blossoming flowers and intricate patterns. She is holding up a decorative coffee cup. The entire composition is framed by an ornate border. The text ""Morning Nectar"" is woven gracefully into the top of the design in a stylized, flowing Art Nouveau font.

A Russian Constructivist propaganda poster from the 1920s. A dynamic, diagonal composition with bold geometric shapes in red, black, and off-white. A stylized photo-montage of a factory worker is central. In a bold, sans-serif, Cyrillic-style font, the word ""ПРОГРЕСС"" (PROGRESS) is printed vertically along the right side.

A Banksy-style stencil artwork on a gritty, weathered concrete urban wall. A small child in silhouette lets go of the string to a military surveillance drone, which floats away like a balloon. Scrawled beneath in a messy, dripping, white spray-paint stencil font are the words: ""MODERN TOYS"". The paint looks slightly faded and has dripped a little.

A macro photograph of an ornate, dust-covered glass potion bottle in a fantasy apothecary. The bottle is filled with a swirling, bioluminescent liquid that glows from within. Tied to the neck of the bottle is an old, yellowed parchment label with burnt edges. On the label, written in elegant, flowing calligraphy, are the words ""Elixir of Whispered Dreams"".

A first-person view from inside a futuristic fighter pilot's helmet. A stunning nebula with purple and blue gas clouds is visible through the cockpit glass. Overlaid on the view is a glowing cyan holographic HUD (Heads-Up Display). In the top left corner, the text ""SHIELDS: 82%"". In the center, a square targeting reticle is locked onto a distant asteroid, with the label ""Object Class: C-Type Asteroid"" written in a clean, sans-serif digital font below it.

A full-length fashion photograph of a woman on a Parisian balcony, wearing a breathtaking Elie Saab haute couture gown. The dress is a cascade of shimmering silver and pale lavender sequins and intricate floral embroidery on sheer tulle. A gentle breeze makes the gown's delicate train flow behind her. The backdrop is the city of Paris at dusk, with the Eiffel Tower softly illuminated in the distance. The lighting is magical and romantic, catching the sparkle of every bead. Shot in the style of a high-fashion Vogue editorial. At the bottom of the image, centered, is the text ""ÉCLAT D'HIVER"" in a large, elegant, minimalist sans-serif font. Directly below it, in a smaller font, is the line ""Haute Couture | Automne-Hiver 2024"".

A surrealist food photograph. On a stark white plate, there is a single, perfectly spherical ""soup bubble"" that is iridescent and translucent, like a soap bubble. Floating inside the bubble are tiny, edible flowers. The plate itself has a message written on it, as if garnished with a dark balsamic glaze. The message, in a looping, elegant cursive script, reads: ""Today's Special: A Moment of Ephemeral Joy"".

My only comment, Qwen looks a bit better on text, but less artistic on the text by a slight margin.  Both look very good.  Hunyuan failed on the Russian text, though I'm not rushing to too many judgements yet. ",30,1759091295.0,StableDiffusion,29,0.9,False

1nsyox0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/comments/1nsyox0/how_much_will_be_the_same_and_do_you_want_it_to_be/,How much will be the same? And do you want it to be?,"So for the new show, I am wondering how many elements will be the same? Think of the hospital: the stair case outside, reception, nurses station, parking lot, coffee bucks. 

Then the sounds: the “bow oe” sound JD hears, the punchline / joke sounds, music style, opening theme and intro. 

Then the pace of the show, length of episodes, fantasies, inner monologue of JD, Cox’s rants and attitude, 90% of the show being at the hospital?

What do you think and expect? And is there any parts you think should be changed, maybe because it would be an improvement? 

What we know is JD wants to be more mature, so I reckon the tone will be most changed. I get a feeling ABC wants to rope in new fans and with a new location and time passing, I could see an updated and even completely different intro, though song maybe only slightly altered.

We also know ABC is more PC so I could see that also influencing the tone. Season 8 already felt different because of it. Along with less episodes of everyone in it, something that given Carla’s 4 episodes is likely to continue. Then I could see the Dr Cox and JD relationship altered due to the change with JD. Lastly, more scenes outside the hospital with the key characters as parents.

I personally don’t mind them going in a bit of a different direction with the tone, but I really want a lot of the sounds, atmosphere and enough recogniseable elements of the old hospital. 

Lastly, given 9 episodes and current model, I’d really appreciate a more solid 30-40 minute duration, but since it’s on tv that is highly unlikely.

We're going for a Gen 4 aesthetic with the overworld in Aesthetic Red, and most of the sprites have been taken from DPPt, HGSS and some from Pokemon Mystery Dungeon for the bigger Pokemon to keep the scaling accurate. We also made some of them ourselves and took some Gen 4 styled versions of Gen 5 NPCs

The different overworld item sprites for the Potion, TM, and Item Bag are used in the overworld as well so you can see what type of item you'll be picking up before you get to it. This brings a lot more life and variety to overworld items rather than them all just being Poke Balls

1nsyn8m,https://i.redd.it/3tzrcv8wsyrf1.jpeg,70 lbs Down... closing in!,"4 days ago I made it to 69 lbs down and, as is a faily typical experience for me, I spent the last three days hovering a lb above that until this morning when I got a whoosh.

70 lbs gone and ~2 lbs left to go!

I started out slow walking ~2 miles about 5 days a week with a coffee shop break in the middle. I worked my way up to a 3.5 mile speed walks of an urban route with hills and big public staircase obstacles about 10 times per week. Then about a month ago I added running intervals into those walks.

Tonight I'll be putting together my new rowing machine. I may wait to kick that off until tomorrow. I got both flu and covid vaccines today so I'm doing a more light cardio routine today already.

When I started I was huffing and puffing just to waddle down the road. I had to wear a hinged compression knee sleeve. Occasionally I wear a waited vest as well. I haven't been able to run since I lost the meniscus ~29 years ago. Now I can run the intervals consistently with a light non-compression sleeve and my goal is to work up to being able to run a 5k within a years time from when I hit my goal weight.

In a month I will layer in weight strength/resistance training next and we'll see where I go from there.

This medication has transformed my life in ways I can't even articulate but more importantly than my physical and mental well-being improvements... I can do things with my kid I couldn't do a year ago. And he sees the idea of self-improvement and the hard work that goes along with it.

The first time I really noticed something was changing I was walking down the street and my shoe came untied. Without thinking I bent over and tied it and realized how long it had been since I could do that without breathing hard and contorting my body.

It was a watershed revelation of becoming something else physically. I am not a very emotional person but I teared up right there on the sidewalk and cried.

People in my life have been very supportive which has been great. Now that I'm in shape and it shows, more and more of them have dumb annoying opinions about how I should live my life. But whatevs. I am perfectly happy with myself and my plan. I'm going to take my medication and put in the hard work that gkes along with it to keep all of this.

Have the best day today folks, and I wish you all the success in the world on your journey!

That's my life as the one-and-only digital marketer at my company. This morning, my boss walked up to my desk, pointed at a picture of our new product—a spectacularly boring industrial widget—and said, 'Alright, work your magic. Make this thing go viral by lunch.' I just smiled, nodded, and quietly chugged my third coffee.

My screen looks like a command center for a spaceship. I've got Google Analytics in one tab, a half-finished email campaign in another, a finicky Facebook ad set I'm babysitting, and a spreadsheet of keywords that looks like the Matrix. One minute I'm a data scientist, analyzing click-through rates and bounce percentages. The next, I'm a wannabe graphic designer, trying to make that industrial widget look like the most exciting thing since sliced bread using a free version of Canva. Then, five minutes later, I'm a writer, trying to craft a blog post about SEO that sounds even remotely interesting.

The hardest part isn't juggling the tasks; it's the constant need to justify your own existence. To the sales team, I'm the person who 'plays on social media all day.' To my boss, I'm the keeper of some dark art he doesn't understand. No one sees the small victories, like finding that perfect long-tail keyword that finally gets us on the first page of Google, or A/B testing a button color and seeing a 2% lift in conversions. It’s a thankless job, until, of course, a flood of leads comes in, and suddenly everyone remembers your name.

So, to my fellow digital marketers out there, I see you. I see you tweaking ad spend at 10 PM, celebrating a good open rate like you just won the lottery, and trying to explain what 'retargeting' is for the tenth time. What's the most ridiculous thing a non-marketer has ever asked you to do?",1,1759090851.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

1nsyd9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1nsyd9z/was_this_sexual_assault_im_very_confused_and_need/,Was this sexual assault? I'm very confused and need advice.,"A guy harassed me at university. One night when I was alone, he suddenly came, pushed me, threw me into a corner, and forced me to walk with him. He even had a friend with him, and together they cornered me. When he pushed me, he started asking unrelated questions. At first I was confused, and when he got very close, I felt pressure. At that moment my vision blurred from the anxiety, I froze, and I avoided looking at him. In the end, he asked me: *“You don’t have anything else, right?”* and I weakly and confusedly said *“No”*, and he quickly ran away.

After that, I felt burning in my body and I don’t know if it was just stress or if he had actually sexually assaulted me. That same day I told myself nothing had happened, but that night I had a nightmare: a guy with a threatening look grabbed me and pulled me towards him. When I woke up, I could still feel the sensation of his hands on my body. I forgot many details of that night because of the intense anxiety, but I only remember he got very close, I felt pressure, and I couldn’t defend myself. For several days afterwards, I wasn’t okay, I cried for no reason, and I felt broken.

A few months later, he came back again. He denied everything and even accused me of hallucinating from study stress or drug use. But again, he grabbed my arm, physically tried to get close to me, and suggested we sit down and have coffee together.

I am worried that he may have sexually assaulted me the first time. How likely is it that this actually happened?
