1ir3za5,https://www.reddit.com/r/tarotpractice/comments/1ir3za5/astro_tarot_reading_for_week_ahead_feb1723/,Astro & Tarot Reading for Week Ahead - Feb17-23,"**General Horoscope:** A mix of energies that encourage both introspection and outward expression. Early in the week, harmonious connections and creative inspiration are highlighted, thanks to the trine between the **Moon in Libra and the Sun in Aquariu**s. As the Sun enters Pisces, you may feel a stronger pull to connect with your inner self, your dreams, and your spiritual side. Mid-week, emotional intensity and a focus on transformation are emphasized, followed by a potential for mental fogginess and communication challenges. The latter part of the week brings a playful and adventurous energy to your social life and creative pursuits, but be mindful of potential illusions or misunderstandings. The week culminates with **Mars going direct in Cancer**, reigniting your passion for home, family, and emotional security.

***This week's transits suggest a need for balance between engaging with the external world and nurturing your inner landscape. While the news cycle may be overwhelming, remember that you have the power to choose where you focus your energy. By prioritizing self-care, cultivating meaningful connections, and expressing your creativity, you can navigate this week with greater clarity and purpose. The emphasis on both emotional depth and outward expression suggests a rich opportunity for personal growth and positive change.***

According to a recent survey, an impressive 58% of small businesses are gearing up to invest big bucks into AI this year. And before you roll your eyes at another ""AI takeover"" headline, consider this: it's changing how people work, but not as ominously as you'd think.

Take Izzard Ink Publishing, for example. Tim McConnehey, its visionary founder, is using AI to revolutionize the publishing process. No, robots aren't churning out novels, but AI is pinpointing potential manuscript pitfalls, offering suggestions, and basically acting as a high-tech Swiss army knife for authors and editors alike. It’s all about efficiency—AI identifies problems, suggests solutions, and lets humans do what they do best: create compelling content.

And before you worry about robots taking over the local coffee shop, consider the broader context: small businesses are seeing AI as a lifeline to productivity and customer service improvements. The need for training and resources is paramount because let's face it, an AI that's not well-understood is like handing a teenager the keys to a Ferrari.

But here’s the kicker: the race is on for small businesses to become AI savvy, and those who crack the code stand to gain a significant competitive edge. The future isn't about man vs. machine; it's about man with machine.

So here's the question: how do you see AI impacting your business or industry? Is it a friend, foe, or just a trendy buzzword? Let’s get talking! 💬",1,1739743227.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

We rarely get to spend much time together anymore and when we do we mostly just stay in and watch movies together or he goes on his phone the entire time. I get that down time is relaxing and I’m totally ok with it but sometimes it gets a bit much. I decided to ask him to go for coffee to get out and do something nice together and he said no. I asked why and his answer was that the roads were still bad from the snow we had gotten  and he didn’t want to drive however I suggested I would drive us there since I was driving to his house anyway and he still said no. He then asked if I could go on the way to his house without him. I called him out on his excuse and asked for the real reason why he wouldn’t come out with me and he got mad called me a “ problematic women” and told me I can’t follow a simple order for once or do anything for him. He told me he doesn’t understand why he has to get out of bed to come with me and when I explained to him it wasn’t about that but rather I just wanted to get out and do something together for a change he just snapped on me again. At this point he was raising his voice quite loud and swearing a lot just repeating how problematic I was and he hung up on me.

A little while later I tried calling  him back to talk about it and he was still extremely angry even more so. He told me I was interrupting him because he was busy playing video games and doesn’t want to be talking to me right now. I told him I understood but that I wanted to fix what had just happened and that I was hurt by how he had spoken to me. He said he can speak to me however he wants and that it’s my fault because I didn’t want to get coffee for him without him coming along. I even went out of my way to apologize to him for what had happened but he was still mad!? 
I explained to him that I felt we haven’t been spending a lot of time together and that I just wanted to get out together. I offered instead of when I came over we could spend less time on our phones and more quality time together and he said he wants to play his games and that I can’t control him. I told him he had been playing all week until late hours of the night and I’ve let him do his thing but the one day of the week I can see him I would prefer his attention for a few hours. He got mad again and said he doesn’t care that we don’t see eachother and he’ll “game all he wants” and that im being controlling.

I love it but I've been considering exchanging it for the 16"" for the larger screen. I know there are multiple threads on this topic. I've read them all. I still haven't come to a decision and I was hoping reddit could help if I describe my use case.

I've never had a computer before, only a 2017 iPad Pro 10.5, so even the 14"" feels like a massive upgrade. However I do notice myself squinting or leaning towards the screen to read fairly often. I'm in my forties and eyesight isn't what it used to be. 

I'll use it mostly at home as a desktop replacement with an occasional outing to the library or coffee shop. If I keep the 14"" I'll consider an external monitor. It'll mostly stay at a desk or with me on the couch or in bed. I won't take it to work because I'm a vet tech and don't need it. Plus it'll get destroyed. 

My main uses are music production in GarageBand (eventually transitioning to Logic Pro), light video and photo editing in Lightroom/Final Cut, and then general browsing and streaming. I don't expect my workload to cause thermal throttling to be an issue. I'm not considering the 15"" Air because I'm too in love with the ProMotion display. 

Finally the value factor: I got the **14"" M4Pro 24gb 12c/16c 512gb for $1699**. I can get the **16"" M4Pro 24gb 14c/20c 512gb for $1891** open box like new at Best Buy.

The former WWE Women’s Champion has been busy as of late, not only competing on both Raw and NXT but also making an appearance in the NBA Celebrity All Star game on 14th February.

The popular Superstar lined up alongside the likes of former NFL player Terrell Owens and British actor Oliver Stark in a team coached by former San Francisco 49’ers legend Jerry Rice.

It proved an unsuccessful night for Rice’s team, however, as they fell to a 66-55 defeat to a Barry Bonds-led side that included Kai Cenat. The 23 year-old recently collaborated with WWE to live stream during the Royal Rumble event.

Bayley’s hectic schedule has not gone unnoticed by CM Punk, who took to Instagram to shower praise upon his friend:

“I want to spotlight this lady today. Tore it up Monday on raw in Nashville, flew to Orlando and crushed it Tuesday on NXT. Is in the nba celebrity all star game Friday, then flies all the way across the country to DC and will main event tonight’s NXT show. Inspirational. Fuelled by coffee. In love with the grind.

As the title suggests, I am looking for some candies that don't have citric acid or mint. I'm very allergic to both of these things. I wasn't always, but after developing these allergies a few years ago, they've only gotten more severe, and now affect my breathing as well. I always have to be weary because citric acid is used in practically EVERYTHING. Including soft drinks, I can barely get by when it comes to anything other than milk and water. The only other drinks I can have are a specific brand of apple juice, a specific brand of root beer, and dr pepper. Obviously that's not including teas and coffee. As much as that might sound like a lot, it's not when you compare it to what other people can have. And candy is even worse about citric acid than soft drinks are.

Unfortunately, this is a very obscure issue, and in order to figure out what's safe, I have to look up each candy individually with its ingredients, which means I can't discover any new ones. Chocolate is nice and all, but chocolate and marshmallows and such are different from being candy in my opinion. The kind of sweetness is way too different. I really miss being able to have gummies, taffies, and so on. Every time i see cotton candy or bubble gum flavored things, I get excited, because I figure that maybe it's safe, and those are my favorite kinds of flavors anyway. But nope, then it turns out that citric acid has been added to those as well. The closest I've ever gotten to a candy I'm not allergic to is a specific brand of milk chews that I really loved from my local Asian market, but they don't stock them there anymore.

Listen up, champ. Your brain’s currently running like a 2003 Dell laptop that’s somehow still trying to load *Minesweeper*. You’re overthinking, stressing about crap that hasn’t happened yet, and scrolling TikTok until your thumb cramps. But fear not! Let’s unfuck this mental junkyard with some *real talk* and zero kale smoothies. 

# Step 1: Stop Letting Your Brain Be a Karen 

Your brain’s out here writing Yelp reviews for hypothetical scenarios. *“One star: My date might hate me. Service was terrible.”* SHUT. IT. DOWN. 

* **Trick:** When your mind starts drama, pretend it’s your weird uncle ranting about aliens. Nod politely, then change the channel. 
* **Pro Tip:** Write down the dumpster fire thoughts and burn the paper. (Or use it to light a candle named “Serenity Now.”) 

# Step 2: Delete the Brain Tabs You’ve Had Open Since 2017 

Your brain’s got more tabs open than a middle-aged dad shopping for lawnmower parts. *Close. Them. All.* 

* **How:** Do one thing at a time. Fold laundry without pondering the meaning of life. Eat lunch without solving climate change. You’re not Batman. 
* **Warning:** Multitasking is a lie invented by people who sell planners. 

# Step 3: Stop Feeding Your Brain Garbage (Literally and Figuratively) 

You wouldn’t fuel a Ferrari with leftover Taco Bell, so why’s your brain running on 3 a.m. Instagram rage and gas station coffee? 

* **Detox Moves:**    1. **Social Media:** Unfollow anyone who posts “live, laugh, love” next to a photo of their cat’s funeral.    2. **News:** If the headline starts with “YOU WON’T BELIEVE…,” you’re being punk’d. Close it.    3. **Food:** Eat one vegetable before you crack that 4th beer. Just one. A French fry doesn’t count. 

# Step 4: Let Your Brain Be Bored (It’s Not a Crime) 

Your brain’s addicted to dopamine hits like a raccoon in a dumpster. Let it sit quietly. Stare at a wall. Think about clouds. *Boredom is where genius hides*—or at least where you remember where you put your charger. 

* **Exercise:** Try “doing nothing” for 5 minutes. If you survive, reward yourself with a snack. You’ve earned it. 

# Step 5: Laugh at Your Own BS (Because Everyone Else Is) 

You’re out here stressing about wearing mismatched socks? Buddy, *no one cares*. The universe is 93 billion light-years wide, and Karen from HR is still mad you used her mug. Perspective! 

* **Homework:** Watch a fail compilation. Realize your life’s not that bad. Unless you’re in the video. Then… oof. 

# Final Step: Forgive Yourself for Being a Hot Mess 

You’re not a robot. You’re a human with a brain that occasionally thinks microwaving metal is a good idea. So what? 

* **Mantra:** “I’m doing my best, and my best includes forgetting my password 8 times a day.” 

**In Conclusion:**  Unfucking your brain isn’t about becoming a zen master who meditates on a mountain. It’s about closing tabs, laughing at the chaos, and remembering that *even Beyoncé probably puts her pants on one leg at a time*. Now go forth, you beautiful disaster. And maybe write your Wi-Fi password down this time.

How to do it?","I've already charted a career for myself that's within the 9-5 world. I am currently trying to exit this route and start my own business. But my energy is barely enough for what I need to do. I need energy for my current job, maintaining my home (cooking + cleaning),  and staying health (gym).

I understand it's winter and there is a winter storm currently happening in my area, and we are all hibernating, but I can't help but feel that my energy is limited. I don't think I am lazy; I am just easily tired.

I feel my big ideas and ambitions do not match my energy level. At times I think that some people are just more successful because they're healthier, therefore have more energy.

Are there any PCOS entrepreneurs here? Any hacks or ways to maximize energy? 

Like I woke up at a good time today, had enough time for coffee and breakfast. I went ONLY for 20 minutes swimming but it was fun and intense but then I crashed when I returned home.

My ideal self is yah, let's work on my business plan. But all I feel is tired. Please help! And I need examples who successful women entrepreneurs who made it with PCOS?

-I mind my own business. I don’t butt into my coworker’s conversations that I am not directly involved in. Not with customers, not with each other, not with our boss.

-I do not get involved in gossip. I do not gossip to my coworkers verbally, through Teams, or on any private devices. If I need to say something about one to the other, it’s strictly business related. I do not listen, nor care, about their personal affairs. Let alone speak on them.

-I stay in my own lane. I do not tell my coworkers how to do their jobs. If they need my help with something, I’m happy to. But if I’m not asked, I don’t tell. If I catch something done incorrectly, I just fix it. If it’s a repeat error and can potentially cause some problems down the road, I’ll gently mention it at that point. 

-I spend my breaks alone. I prefer to decompress with a book or music. I don’t want to talk, as that is my job. Talking to customers all day. 

-I do not discuss my own personal matters at work. That one doesn’t need elaboration.

***Now. A little on how my coworker does her job.***

-She cannot mind her own business. Everyone else’s business is her’s too.  She even said to me once (not happy that I spend my breaks alone) that I’m basically obligated to spend my breaks with her and my other coworker. “You need to be able to vent about things. And this is a safe place.” She tried to talk our boss into “mandatory social lunches.” I can’t even order food without her needing to know what I got and why I didn’t offer anyone else anything.

-Gossip is like a hobby to her. This is one of the reasons I do not discuss personal matters at work. She will use them against you later. What little bit I let spill about me early on (my anxiety) she used as a way to hurt me. Telling me my husband won’t be able to stand me. She gossips about our customers as soon as they leave/she hangs up the phone. She leaves her office multiple times a day to go talk about people with my other coworker.

-She swerves all over. Listens to my conversations with customers so she can tell me what I said wrong, or find out who the customer was so she can talk about them. If I make a mistake, she makes a big deal out of it. I can’t do my job without her input at some point.

***A little on how I handle her***

-Short answers when she asks unnecessary, non-work related questions. 

-Not reacting when she says things just to get to me.

-Not letting her drag me into gossip about others.

-Not responding when she takes jabs at me meant to hurt my feelings. 

In short, I’m polite with her, but I keep her at arm’s length. 

This is how I came to the conclusion she literally despises me.

-I have caught her sort-of scowling at me when she walks by my desk.

-She practically slams her coffee cup down on my desk when she’s getting ready to leave (I’m at reception and my desk has a ledge.)

-She has made awful remarks about me in Teams to my other coworker. Called me a liar, accused me of liking a male coworker even though I’m married, twisted my words, said “I’M GOING TO HURT HER” for reasons I don’t fully know. Maybe I was annoying her in some way? Just all kinds of bad stuff on there.

-There was the comment about my husband not being able to stand me.

-I feel stalked. She notices my every move. If I blow my nose, I must be about to call in sick. If I get up from my desk to do anything I’m away from my desk too much and “ignoring customers.” There was a message on Teams where she told my coworker how many times I went to the bathroom.

-Every time she catches a mistake I made, no matter how minor, she drags me through the mud over it.

-She talks about things she knows will hurt or bother me, then make sure I can hear her. An example would be when her and my other coworker were talking about war she had mentioned the draft and how men even older than 26 could be sent out (my husband is 29.) I was staying out of it. She eventually said “did you hear what I said?” to me. I said “no.” And she repeated the part about the draft then proceeded to tell me my husband could be sent away.

-I’m damned if I do, damned if I don’t. Set up for failure. I’ll be doing something one way, she’ll get on my case (even tell my coworker I’m incapable), tell me to do it another way. I do exactly as instructed, it’s still wrong.

-She once pitted my other coworker and I against each other. Making up I was saying things I wasn’t. When my coworker confronted me, she believed the problem coworker over me. No matter how desperately I tried to get my side out, she called me a liar and mocked me. 

This is just some of what she does. And all I can think is…what did I do to her? I literally just go to work, do my job, and go home. Yet signs point to the fact this goes beyond her simply not liking me but having some kind if deep hatred. It just feels like very dark, malicious, intent. 

Yes I’ve gone to our boss, who’s also the owner. She won’t do anything about it. ***We do not have HR*** I am looking for a new job. But until then, I have to deal with this. 

My question isn’t what do I do. It’s more wanting to understand how anyone could hate someone this much without them ever doing anything to them.

So scary!! Clearly I’ve hit a limit but I’m trying to figure out what exactly that may had been. 

I started running about 1 year ago ago for a 5k. I loved it and stayed for a while around the 10K distance. This year I signed up for a half marathon so I decided to go back to increasing mileage every week.   

The most I’ve done is 10 miles (but that was months ago) and this week I was completing 9.5 miles. I ate a good breakfast, eggs with turkey and cheese and a bagel with cream cheese. Drank coffee and water. An hour later Before I left I ate a banana with honey. Drank some water. Went out at mid 30s degree weather. I was dressed well I think. Water resistant fleece tights, shirt and wind breaker jacket, gloves none of it cotton and merino socks. I do not have waterproof shoes. About half way the wind picked up and it started to pour rain. I got wet and cold but kept going eating some candy every 1/2-1 mile. 

About 1 mile left I was feeling so cold it was hurting my feet and hands. I tried to eat candy but hand was too frozen to get it out of my pocket. It just would not move the way I wanted. That should a been my sign. I was so close to home I kept going. I finished the mile and was about .2 miles from home. My vision went foggy, I couldn’t talk straight and I went down and luckily my husband was able to see me and carry me home. I just could not stand up. He took me straight to shower and gave me chips and coconut water. 

So now I’ve realized I pushed myself too hard. Trying to narrow down what exactly it was. My first thought is the wind and rain made me too cold I needed more calories than normal? Dehydrated possibly? 😩😩😩 that was a scary moment from something I love doing so much I hope it never happens again. ",0,1739742334.0,beginnerrunning,1,0.5,False

I know how this sounds. ""The schizophrenic dude is on the schizophrenia subreddit asking for advice on how to keep his food and drink safe from being poisoned"" but this is actually happening. This is NOT a joke.

My main question is how can I make a plate of food or a cup of coffee and set it up so that there is no way of opening it without there being obvious signs of tampering? I've lately been drawing complicated lines on bags of food then folding it up and taking pictures of it as I fold it up and the position of it in the fridge so that if it is tampered with it will be plainly obvious. He just put something in my coffee so I had to pour it out and wash the cup. I think he is either storing the poison in the pantry or the garage and I am 99% sure it is cyanide so my death won't be pretty or peaceful by any means. I don't think he is after my mom. He is after me. He wants me dead. Please help me out with some advice or something. As long as he can't tamper with my food I am good. I can physically defend myself no problem. It's just the poisoning thing. I have left letters and digital notes and evidence literally everywhere that I am aware of this plot and have made my mother aware so that if I suddenly pass away she will know to tell the cops to investigate him first. and do blood tests and everything else to see what poisons are in my blood.

I'm seriously getting pissed the fuck off that my life is constantly in danger and there's so little I can do about it. I hate him so fucking much for this. Endanger MY LIFE and act like everything is cool. He's a backstabbing murderous bastard and I am going to expose him for this.

so two weeks ago we had planned to hangout at 1 and just do a little craft and shopping. (this part WAS my fault and i can admit but it was my tipping point) around 1250 i text her saying my alarm never went and i just woke up but im still down. at around 115 i text her that i’m ready whenever and she’s already out running errands. okay that’s fine i guess i can chill for a minute until she’s done. she offers to pick me up for lunch but refuses because im not hungry and she doesn’t want me to watch her eat. so i say that’s fine just pick me up after. well NOW she has more homework to do so i should just go to the store myself and we can make crafts later. that’s fine i do my shopping 345 comes around i tell her im about to be home and im ready. she just got home so she’s tired and she wants a nap. so how about after that. again i say it’s fine. but at this point it’s going to be 5pm and i haven’t done half the shit i needed to because i was supposed to be done by now. so i tell her we can hangout but i just can’t for too long. so now we might as well not hangout and do it another time. 

she texted me two weeks ago and until
today i was giving it time and im still mad. it’s not just this ONE time but this is what it’s always like. and then on top of that another bad habit of hers is constantly bringing up healthy food and portioning sizes. i struggle with what i assume to be an eating disorder and she KNOWS this. i go days without eating and have a hard time getting myself to have enough and consistently eat meals. so even tho i try to eat healthy of course i still eat “junk” as my snacks just so that im getting some type of food. well in the store while we shop she’s always making a comment about it. “oh i would never eat that” “i only eat healthy food” and her snacks at work will be something like two celery sticks and peanut butter while she shames people for eating a package snack. for instance my other coworker is on a calorie deficit and when she caught her having coffee she wouldn’t stop going “what about your calorie deficit” as if you’re just supposed to starve yourself. 


now here’s the hard part. these aren’t all her problems but it’s what has been irritating me the most. iidk what exactly to even say because i just am sick of trying to make plans with her and having them cancelled or we just do nothing because she’s too lazy or whatever to do something else. so far this is what im thinking (she just invited me to hangout and do crafts AGAIN this weekend) 

“after last time i don’t think i want to hangout again honestly. i tried multiple times to hangout and you kept putting them off and that was really my only free time to do anything. this isn’t the first time you have cancelled and it’s been one too many for me. i waited almost four hours and we didn’t even see each other despite me attempting so many times.”

 Been shortlisting different machines and going around in circles!. So I am thinking of getting a basic espresso machine + standalone grinder grinder 


Option 1 - prosumer
Profitec Go or

Option 2 - consumer
Delonghi Dinamica plus - app support but doubtful when it comes to its utility.


Delonghi Rivelia - newest model

Not certain which delonghi machines are thermoblock/thermocoil. Else I should avoid delonghi altogether. Few claim bad customer service.

turn rivers back with whispered plans.  
They shape the world, they weave the thread,  
never counting hearts left dead.  

They play with fate like rolling dice,  
never stopping, never twice  
to ask what lingers in their wake—  
the lives they bend, the bones they break.  

But even stone will wear away,  
and even light can learn to stray.  
A candle, left too long to burn,  
may one day set the world to turn.  

She was nothing, small and still,  
a shadow left against their will.  
But shadows learn, and shadows wait,  
and even fate can fear its fate.  
  

Maria Madroon still set two cups of coffee on the table every morning.  

She didn’t know why she did it. Habit, maybe. Or hope, though she wouldn’t admit to the latter. The coffee always went cold. She never touched the second cup. She just sat there, staring at the space across from her, waiting for a man who would never come.  

No one would tell her what happened to Vincent. The staff at the Little Lamplight only offered quiet condolences, their eyes heavy with something like pity. Samantha—whoever, whatever she really was—hadn’t thrown her out. Instead, she had given Maria a private room, a place where she could grieve undisturbed. That should have been a kindness. It felt like an insult.  

She didn’t want their pity. She wanted her husband back.  

Maria had never trusted magic. How could she? She and Vincent were normal in a world that had no use for them. Wizards, fae, and all manner of unnatural things played their games, fought their wars, reshaped the world in their image, and never once thought of the people trampled underfoot. Magic had always been cruel. Now, it had taken the only thing she had ever truly loved.  

She started to pay closer attention to the way magic wove itself into the world. She had never bothered before—it had never been for her—but now she watched. She listened. She learned. The more she saw, the angrier she became.  

They moved mountains and called it sport. They pulled apart the fabric of reality and called it art. They walked among lesser beings and called it mercy.  

Maria had been one of those lesser beings her entire life. She had known her place, followed the rules, kept her head down.  

But Vincent had followed the rules, too, and he was dead.  

So tell her again why she should play nice.  

Let the mages, the fae, the gods wrapped in human skin have their fun. Let them think their power made them untouchable. Let them laugh at the idea of a woman with no magic and no place in their world.  

They wouldn’t be laughing for long.  

After all, what’s more dangerous than a woman with nothing to lose?

I’m newly diagnosed with ADHD and I just wanted to see if anyone can relate to this:
- for the longest time I’ve had trouble focusing, in elementary school even though I got good grades I could never start my schoolwork in class (you know how teachers sometimes give time in class to work on things) and would always only be able to do work at home but my mom would have to get me to refocus constantly.

I had trouble focusing in class and taking notes in class.

But when I got to university, as soon as I had access to a laptop and google drive I was able to focus more in class.

Also, now I can only work / study in coffee shops. Even though there are distractions idk how to explain it but the environment allows me go hyper focus. At home I get distracted.

I can’t work in libraries because it’s too quiet.  

I can’t study at any coffee shop though it has to be mild-medium level of loudness. Some coffee shops / restaurants have people screaming so I can’t do this.

Can anyone relate to this?

I used to believe that being “busy” literally meant I was being productive—until I stumbled upon the 80/20 rule (otherwise known as the Pareto Principle). Basically, 80% of your results often come from 20% of your efforts. It’s like discovering your favorite 20% of Netflix shows actually give you 80% of the binge-watching joy (looking at you, Stranger Things).

I started applying this in my workday, and guess what? Suddenly, those unimportant tasks that chewed up half my day took a backseat. Instead, I focused on:

• **Identifying my key tasks**. You know, the stuff that truly moves the needle.  
• **Scheduling the most important work first** (while I still have morning coffee buzz).  
• **Letting the small stuff wait**—because if it’s not mission-critical, it can chill on the sidelines.  

Is it nerve-wracking to see other tasks sit undone? Sure. But this “work smarter, not harder” mindset helps me get the big wins without burning out. Sometimes it feels like I hacked the system, because who doesn’t love feeling accomplished by lunchtime?

Now, I’m curious if anyone else has tried trimming out the “fluff” to make extra space for what really matters. It’s still crazy to me how a handful of key tasks can have such an outsized impact. It definitely changed the way I look at my daily grind.",1,1739741829.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

* Buttons at a curved angle, not on top, preferably vertical (much like the Duo Gen 1 and Gen 2).
* Having app control would make this problem go away.
* A side reservoir, as I'm unable to physically reach above the unit to pour water into it.  I can however, detach a reservoir, fill it and re-install it.
* I'm able to reach and insert a k-cup, not a problem.  One can do this without looking.

Ideally, I want a Keurig that has these features, as well:

* Cold Coffee
* Ability to make a pot of coffee (granted, putting in a filter and filling it are a bit difficult for me, but doable).

I'm pretty sure that what I'm looking for, does not exist (at least not yet, for Keurig), but I'm interested in seeing what app controlled models are currently available.",2,1739741598.0,keurig,0,1.0,False

**BEFORE A COURT CAN HEAR A CASE: ""WE LISTEN AND WE DON'T JUDGE"" (LOL EXCEPT WE DO)** 

A FEDERAL COURT NEEDS TWO THINGS: 

* SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION (SMJ) - what TYPE of case can we hear? 
*  PERSONAL JURISDICTION (PJ) -- WHO can we drag into court? 

**1. SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION (SMJ)** 

* What the flying fadoodle is SMJ. It's the power of a court to hear a certain type of case. We've got THREE  LOOKS AND THAT'S IIIIITTTT 
   * ✅ Federal - Question 🏛️
   * ✅ Diversity 🌎
   * ✅ Supplemental ➕
* 📌 **Federal Question...ALEXA, play ""Question"" by Taylor Swift**
   * ""Can I ask you a question?"" - the federal court say YES  BUT only if that question arises under federal law or state law that raises a substantial federal question. 
   * ✔️ **MUST** be on the **face** of Plaintiff’s well-pleaded complaint.
   * ✔️ **NO** Defendant tricks. If *they* bring up federal law, **we don’t care**. 
   * ✔️ **NO** sneaky amendments. The **claim** must start federal **from the jump**.
   * 🔥 **Example:** 
      * **YES:** a copyright lawsuit (because it's under federal law) 
      * **NO:** A contract dispute unless it's based on **federal law** (e.g., international trade agreement)
* **📌  DIVERSITY JURISDICTION - IT'S A EXCLUSIVE PARTY VIBE 🎉**
   * **TWO RULES ✌️**
      * ✔️ No plaintiff can be from the same state as any defendant 🚫🏡
      * ✔️ the amount in controversy must EXCEED $75,000 (AKA at LEAST $75,000.01)
      *  🔥 **Example:** 
* 📌 SUPPLEMENTAL JURISDICTION - BESTIE'S +1 TO THE PARTY 
   * A district court with jurisdiction over a claim may exercise ""supplemental"" jx over additional claims over which the court would not independently have SMJ 
   * ✔️ **Common nucleus of operative fact** – If the claims are so intertwined that separating them would be a mess, we let it in.
   * ❌ **CAN’T be used to sneak in a claim that would destroy diversity jurisdiction.**
   * 🔥 **Example:**
      * You sue someone for federal trademark infringement and you also want to sue for state defamation. If both claims arise from the same incident, the court will likely allow the state claim under supplemental jurisdiction. 

2. PERSONAL JURISDICTION (PJ) - LETS GET PERSONAL BESTIES!! Personal Jurisdiction, know it love it learn it 

* **What is PJ?** (Fun fact, my brother's nickname is pj and i texted him the definition of PJ and was like I always think of you! and he was like....... okayyyyyy???) 
   * Its not just about WHAT a court can hear (SMJ) but WHO they can drag into court. 
   * Three Types 
      * 1️⃣ **In Personam** – Power over **the person** 🏃. 
      * 2️⃣ **In Rem** – Power over **the property** 🏡.
      *  3️⃣ **Quasi-in-Rem** – Kind of about **property**, but mostly about **people fighting over it**.
* 📌 In Personam Jurisdiction - You've Been Served, no cap 💌
   * In Personam jurisdiction is the power that the court has over an individual party. 
   * How can a court have power over you? 
      * ✔️ **Voluntary Presence** – If you’re in the state voluntarily (going to a concert or a weekend getaway) and get served, **too bad, you’re in.**
      * ✔️ **Domicile 🏡** – Where you live **and intend to stay permanently.**
      * ✔️ Consent - You can literally **agree** to be sued in a specific state. 
      * ✔️ Long-Arm Statutes 🦾 - Courts can reach out and grab you by your bootstraps if you have minimum contacts with the state. 
   * Due Process Requirements
   * In Rem 
      * the authority of a court to determine issues concerning rights in property either real or personal 
   * Quasi-in-Rem 
      * determines only the interest of the parties to the action regarding the property located in the forum state 

**3. VENUE** 

* Venue is proper 
   * 1️⃣ **ANY defendant resides**, if **all defendants reside in the same state**. 
   * 2️⃣ **A substantial part of the events or omissions** giving rise to the claim **occurred**. 
   * 3️⃣ (Fallback Rule) **If no other venue works,** then **any district where the defendant is subject to PJ.**
   * 💡 **Think of it like:** Even if you **get invited to the party (jurisdiction)**, you **still need to show up at the right address (venue).** 🏡

4. PRE TRIAL PROCEDURES - LET'S GET IT STARTED IN HA LETS GET IT START IN HERE.. COURT! 

* Preliminary Injunctions and Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs)
   *  **Rule 65 allows a court to grant an injunction** (a form of equitable relief) that either: 
   * ✅ **Forces** someone to do something (**mandatory injunction**) 📝 
   * ✅ **Stops** someone from doing something (**prohibitory injunction**) ✋
* 💥 **TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) = Emergency Stop Button** 
   * ✔️ **Used to preserve the status quo** until there’s a **full hearing** for a **preliminary injunction**. 
   * ✔️ **Only lasts 14 days max** (unless extended by the court). 
   * ✔️ **Issued without notifying the other party** if it’s truly urgent.
* TROs & Preliminary Injunctions Require the Plaintiff to Show 
   * 1️⃣ **They will suffer ""irreparable harm"" without the order.** 
   * 2️⃣ **Monetary damages wouldn’t be enough to fix it.** 
   * 3️⃣ **They are likely to win on the merits.**
* 🔥 **Example:**
   * YES: A company is about to bulldoze a historic landmark = money alone would not bring back this landmark if it is bulldozed. Injunction is allowed here 
   * NO: You're suing because your neighbor stole your rare orange reputation vinyl, but they can pay you back. No injunction needed. 

* **Discovery (including e-discovery) - SHOW ME THE RECEIPTS** 
   * **After the complaint & answer → Rule 26 kicks in = Discovery time!**
      * ✔️ **Discovery = Both sides exchange relevant info in a cute little conference (i'm sure its totes adorbs and they get coffees and stuff). Each side has to disclose anything necessary.** 
      * ✔️ **Info doesn’t have to be admissible in trial**, just **relevant** to a claim/defense. 
      * ✔️ **Privileged info (like lawyer-client convos) = Off-limits!** 🚫 
      * E-Discovery 

* Spoliation - Accidentally deleting all your close friends from IG = BIG LEGAL OOPS 
   * **Spoliation** 
      * The **negligent destruction of evidence alone is NOT enough for sanctions under Rule 37**. **It must be intentional OR result in an inability to restore the lost evidence.**
   * 🔥 **Example Fix:**
      * **You accidentally delete a few old files that were never requested?** ❌ **No sanctions.**
      * **You delete emails after getting a subpoena?** ✅ **Spoliation = Sanctions.**
   * 💡 **Think of it like:** The **“I lost my homework” excuse**, except **you get legally wrecked for it.** 💀
* Rule 11 Sanctions 
   * **Rule 11 exists to prevent lawyers from filing dumb, frivolous lawsuits.**
      * ✔️ If a **motion/pleading is ridiculous** (no legal basis, filed just to harass), the court **can fine the lawyer**. 
      * ✔️ **Safe Harbor Rule** → **You get 21 days to fix it** before the opposing party **files a motion for sanctions**.
   * 🔥 **Example:** 
      * **Lawyer files a lawsuit saying McDonald's is secretly an alien-run company?** 🚀 **Frivolous = Rule 11 Sanctions.**
      * **Lawyer misquotes a case or lies about evidence?** 🤥 **Rule 11 Sanctions, even if the case itself was valid.**

**5. LAW APPLIED BY FEDERAL COURTS (AKA OUR BESTIE MISS ERIE)** 

Ok Erie is a biatch so lets break this down girlie pops 💅

* General Rule
   * A federal court hearing state law case under diversity or supplemental jurisdiction is required to apply the SUBSTANTIVE law of the state in which it sits. However, federal courts apply federal procedural law. 
   * 🔥 **Example:**
      * ✅ **YES, Apply State Law:** A state law says **defamation cases require ""actual malice"" for liability.** A federal court hearing a diversity case in that state **must apply the state rule because it's substantive.**
      * ❌  **NO, Apply Federal Law:** Federal courts **always use the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) for things like motions, discovery, and pleading standards.**
   * 💡 **Think of it like:** The **state sets the playlist (substantive law), but federal courts control the AUX (procedural law).** 🎶
* Erie is ONLY an issue when the two elements are present: 
   * ✔️ The **federal court is hearing a case under diversity or supplemental jurisdiction** (NOT federal question jurisdiction). 
   * ✔️ **There’s a conflict between state and federal law** and the judge has to decide which to apply.
* **CONFLICT RESOLUTION - Like when your two besties are fighting and you have to be the middle man** 
   * the court must ask federal statute or federal rule: if there is a valid federal statute or rule of procedure on point, then the court must apply federal law rather than state law. 
   * if no federal statute or rule is on point then the court must determine whether federal common law, rather than state law, should be applied. The court will ask, **whether the failure to apply state law will lead to different outcomes** in state and federal court: 
      * if no, then district court will generally apply federal common law rather than state law 
      * if yes, the court will apply state law, unless it goes against federal interests. 
   * The court may also examine the issue by weighing the interests of state and federal judiciaries and apply the law whose policy is more important 
      * If the state has a greater interest in having its rule applied, then the court will apply state law 
      * Otherwise, the court will apply federal law 
   * Finally, to prevent forum-shopping, the court will follow state law if selecting state law would prevent overcrowding of the federal court system. 
   * 💡 **Think of it like:** If **applying federal law would give you an unfair edge**, state law takes over. **No cheating the system!**

**6. VERDICTS, JUDGMENTS & MOTIONS** 🎤

   * **Jury and non-jury trials** 
      * ✔️ **7th Amendment** = Right to a jury trial in federal civil cases **if the amount in controversy exceeds $20.** (Rule 38) 
      * ✔️ **Jury decides FACTS** 👀 
      * ✔️ **Judge decides LAW** ⚖️
      * **Think of it like:** **Juries = People’s Choice Awards 🏆, Judges = Critics’ Choice Awards 🎭**
   * 📌 Rule 12(b) Motions – ""Motion to Yeet This Case 🚀
      * Prior to filing an answer, defendant may file a motion under rule 12(b)
      * Think of this like: blocking someone because their texts make zero sense
      * **Rule 12(b)(6): Failure to State a Claim Upon Which Relief Can be Granted**
      * EXAMPLE: Plaintiff sues McDonald's because they're ""emotionally distressed by the McRib"" with no law or reasoning behind it  (i mean... fair) but McDonald's is going to file a 12(b)(6). 
      * ANSWER
      * Counterclaims 
   * Settlement Issues 
      * Under Rule 23(e) the claims, issues, or defenses of the certified class may be voluntarily settled, compromised, or dismissed only with approval of the court. 

**7. APPEALABILITY & REVIEW**

* Final Judgment Rule - WAIT TIL ITS DONE BESTIE 
   * **Federal courts of appeal can only review FINAL judgments**—meaning the trial court has finished its job.
      * Real life legal rule: Federal courts of appeals have jurisdiction over appeals of the final judgments of the district courts. A final judgment is a decision on the merits that leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment. 
   * Think of it like: you can't post ""breakup"" quotes/songs on your IG story until the situationship is actually over. 💔
* Appeal of Interlocutory Orders - UHH WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING? 
   * 28 U.S.C § 1292(a) makes certain equitable orders reviewable immediately as a matter of right, including: 
      * (i) An order granting, modifying, refusing, or dissolving an injunction; 
      * (ii) An order appointing or refusing to appoint a receiver; and 
      * (iii) An order appointing or refusing the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed 
   * 💡 **Think of it like:** You **can’t rate a movie on Letterboxd until you’ve seen the whole thing... unless it’s SO bad you have to leave early.** 🎥
* Collateral-Order Doctrine - A FAST PASS TO APPEAL 
   * A court of appeals has discretion to hear and rule on a district order if it
      * (1) conclusively determines the disputed question 
      * (2) resolves an important issue that is completely separate from the merits of the action, and 
      * (3) is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment 
   * 💡 **Think of it like:** **Skipping the line because your issue is VIP.** ✨
* Mandamus Review 
   * **Higher courts can step in when a lower court abuses its power.**
      * ✔️ **Used rarely, only for extreme judicial overreach.**
   * REAL LIFE LEGAL RULE: Under a writ of mandamus, an appellate court can immediately review an order of a lower court that is an abuse of judicial authority. Also, the petitioner must establish that there is no other adequate means of obtaining the desired relief and that the right to such relief is clear and indisputable. 
   * 💡 **Think of it like:** **having to go Karen and call the manager when an employee completely messes up.** 🛎️
* Class Action Certification 
   * ✔️ **If a judge approves or denies class certification, it can be appealed immediately.** 
   * ✔️ **Must be filed within 14 days.**
      * REAL LIFE LEGAL RULE: A court of appeals has the discretion to permit an appeal from a district court order granting or denying class action certification.
   * 🔥 **Example:**
      * **Plaintiffs try to sue a company as a class action, and the judge says no?** 🚀 **Immediate appeal allowed.** 
* Standards of Review 
   * 1️⃣ **De Novo (Fresh Start) 🔄** – No deference, reviewing law from scratch. 
   * 2️⃣ **Clearly Erroneous 🤨** – Only overturned if obviously wrong. 
   * 3️⃣ **Abuse of Discretion 🚩** – Judge’s ruling is respected **unless it’s ridiculous**.
      * Clearly Erroneous - a finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the appellate court based on the entirety of the evidence is left with definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. 
      * De Novo - When an appellate court relies or the record created in a trial court does not entertain the admission of additional evidence, the appellate court review the evidence and law without deference to the trial court's legal rulings. 
      * Abuse of Discretion - A trial court's rulings on discretionary matters, like: admissibility of evidence, sanctions for violation of discovery rules, or the granting or denial of a motion to transfer venue or to sever actions. 
   * 💡 **Think of it like:** **If your professor fails you for using 12-point font instead of 11.5, that’s abuse of discretion.** ✏️

1ir34x8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ir34x8,Surviving motherhood 💕😅,"My tips and tricks 💕 

1.	Meal Planning Like a Pro:
You’ve got chicken on Monday, ground beef on Tuesday, and pork chops on Wednesday. By Thursday, it’s “whatever’s left in the fridge,” and Friday is pizza—because let’s be real, even planners need a break.
	2.	Budgeting Like a Boss:
Use the budget section to make sure there’s always room for two essentials: bills and your sanity-saving coffee runs. (Pro tip: Starbucks is a line item in your financial plan.)
	3.	Shopping Lists That Save Your Soul:
Your shopping list ensures you leave the store with actual groceries—not just snacks, wipes, and that candle aisle detour.
	4.	No Surprise Birthdays:
With the dates-to-remember section, you’ll never be caught off guard when the school sends home another request for cupcakes on a Tuesday night.
	5.	Outsmart the Chaos:
While the kids are plotting how to turn your house upside down, you’ve got a daily agenda to restore order. Mom: 1, Chaos: 0.
	6.	Meal Prepping Like a Ninja:
Thanks to your planner, you’re so prepared you even know when leftovers will make their second (or third) appearance.
	7.	Spending Tracker for Mom Math:
When your kids ask for something outrageous, like a pony or name-brand cereal, the spending tracker gives you the perfect response: “Let’s see what’s left in the budget, sweetie.”
	8.	Shopping Lists That Win:
Your planner’s shopping list ensures you hit every aisle and don’t forget the one thing your family always runs out of: patience (and ketchup).
	9.	Weekly Agendas That Save Lives:
Your planner keeps track of school drop-offs, meetings, doctor’s appointments, and when you last washed your hair—because balance is everything.
	10.	Planning Is Your Superpower:
Your family thinks you’re psychic because dinner magically appears, the lights stay on, and the budget doesn’t break. Nope, just a mom with her trusty planner.

Motherhood is your circus, but your planner makes you the ringmaster.",1,1739741348.0,planners,0,0.57,False
1ir34w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ir34w9/cant_decide_between_these_coffee_machines_1000/,Can't decide between these coffee machines [1000 euro],"First of all coming from a Sage Barista Express. Had this machine for a few months but the inconsistent brewing, the machine on my nerves.

I have been doing a lot of research from super automates to prosumer coffee machines whilst gaining a better understanding of different boiler types, home barista etc etc. Budget would be less than 1k euro.

 Been shortlisting different machines and going around in circles!. So I am thinking of getting a basic espresso machine + standalone grinder grinder 


Option 1 - prosumer
Profitec Go or
Letit Victoria 
Letit Elizabeth 
( Excluded Anita and Kate due to integrated grinders and couldn't find much of information on the burr and settings)

Option 2 - consumer
Delonghi Dinamica plus - app support but doubtful when it comes to its utility.


Delonghi Rivelia - newest model

I am reluctant going for a breville and sage. Many claimed that these machines do not have longevity.

Not certain which delonghi machines are thermoblock/thermocoil. Else I should avoid delonghi altogether. Few claim bad customer service. 

Your help is appreciated. Thanks guys.

1ir34cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tacoma/comments/1ir34cp/one_year_in_tacoma_my_favorites/,One Year in Tacoma - My Favorites,"I have officially been in Tacoma for one year. I moved here by myself from the Midwest in Feb of 2024. 

I want to share just a few of my favorite parts/experiences in this city:

- No McMansions. I like that every home and building is unique. To me, it appears that older buildings are maintained and preserved instead of bulldozed. 

- I never get tired of looking at The Mountain. Especially at sunrise. 

- Bar Rosa - great drinks and pizza. 

-Chambers Bay sunsets. 

- I made friends. I have made friends in a coffee shop, here on Reddit, and sitting at a bar having wine. I was very worried I wouldn’t make any friends until a few years.

I'll be traveling with my spouse (we are 30&34) to attend a business event in Fes (Feb 26-28) I have five days before the event and a week after it. 

Keeping in mind:  
\- It's a budget friendly trip, so no expensive activities or overpriced luxuries experiences.   
\- We'll be fasting for Ramadan from March 1st to 7th. So no hectic activities during the day for that week.  
\- We hope to have a balanced and immersive experience, so fewer destinations with deeper exploration is definitely better for us.    
\- We are from Egypt, so I believe we're not so keen on having dessert experiences that much. 

Most sources and travel bloggers focus on the Sahara Desert and Marrakech, but I hope to know what Moroccans would recommend. I am particularly looking for unique experiences that cannot be found in Egypt, like the Atlas mountains, the Berber villages, Ifran and snowy landscapes, green valleys and waterfalls, and unique historical architected. 

Casablanca will be my arrival and departure hub. From there, I can move to Tangier (and maybe visit Tétouan and Chefchaouen, then Fes for the event, then Ifran for one day. After that I am now decided yet. 

Thank you in advance.

1ir340n,https://i.redd.it/zi3u53p1kkje1.jpeg,Improving behavior and response times,"Hi all, 

My male Doberman is just over 18 months old and a really good dog, but has a few behavioral issues I’d like to work on to make him the BEST dog. 

For context, I’ve worked with him almost every day for at least 15-20 minutes of training, along with at least 2 hours of off-leash outside time either hiking, at a park, or playing with the flirt pole, tug, or fetch. 

He’s a good lil dude, but is more independent and less willing to please than any Doberman or dog I’ve ever owned. The biggest “issues” we’re working through right now are these:

Whining
-he whines in the car endlessly. This is a Dobie thing, and it’s reduced SO MUCH since he was a puppy, but if anyone has advice on how to stop his whining in the car I swear to god I’ll buy you your favorite coffee at Starbucks. 

Command response time 
-he’s really good when he’s “on”, but getting his focus is difficult, as well as getting him to respond quickly when we’re not “working”. He’ll sit, but he’ll take 2 commands and shift around for line 10 seconds before he does.
He does well responding to commands around other dogs 90% of the time. He responds to commands 90% of the time, but I have to use the e-collar as reinforcement at least a few times every walk or at the park. I’d like to get this to 100% certainty without needing the collar or other incentives. 

Inability to settle when needed, especially if company is around
-pretty self-explanatory. He has a really hard time settling down. 

Interactions with other dogs (playing too hard, neck over body trying to dominate, not knowing how to introduce properly) 
This one is my mistake. His first playmates were a pair of huge Great Danes, and he not only like to play rough, but he also is very intense in how he approaches other dogs. He thinks everyone is his friend and wants to play as intensely as he does. 

I really appreciate it if you took the time to read this far. If you have any resources, tips, or tricks you’d be willing to share please share them in the comments. I really want to do this myself, as I feel like I’m more than capable of training him, but there are so many resources and channels / experts out there it’s difficult to sort through everything.

I’m currently at the end of a stay and due to check out tomorrow and I’m not sure about how to handle my review. The listing is 4.86 stars on 50 reviews and the host has superhost status. 

The apartment is nice and as described, some of the photos are a bit misleading as they show very specific things like ketchup/mustard/relish, keurig pods and coffee creamer which are not actually provided. Maybe I’m overreacting but if there is a photo that shows only keurig pods and coffee mate, not just an area, a zoomed in photo of only those items, I expect those things to be here. 

Upon check in my husband went to have a bath and there was no plug for the bath tub, so he switched to the shower and the knob for the shower fell apart in his hand. The host said he could come in an hour but I manage to fix it on my own, the next day they did provide a shower plug. 

The pots and pans provided are awful - old, nonstick coating long gone so everything sticks, as my husband put it “we’ve thrown out better pots than these”. 

I also find it a bit odd that there are no provided dish clothes or wash cloths as here in Canada they’re usually pretty standard. Not a big deal though, we just went out and bought a few. 

Overall our stay has been good and the place is nice. I just feel like the amenities are not as expected or pictured, and the whole shower thing was annoying but not a huge deal. 

What is a fair review to leave? From being on this page I know anything below 5 stars isn’t good for the host, but I’m really not sure if I can leave a 5 star review. I’m trying not to be too petty and keep things fair.

I never recovered from the mono fully. I still have had severe lymph node pain, and fatigue. I got my thyroid checked and my numbers were good. But now,I'm getting very weird health problems that I never had before, specifically severe allergic reactions. I never had an allergic reaction like how I am getting them now! They're food and medicine related, I will say to what and why I think that it's histimine intolerance.

All within the last 30 days, I started getting somewhat severe allergic reactions occasionally to things that I was never allergic to. Then, the reactions took a turn from bad to worse. I was recently sick with the flu and had a suspected kidney infection (which is very serious) and was put on a number of different medicines. I started getting a very bad allergic reaction while in the hospital, and literally had like five nurses in the room to make sure the reaction didn't escalate any further. After my time in the hospital and on antibiotics, it feels like I can't eat anything! Before I had a list of things that bothered me, which was:

soy, nuts and seeds, chocolate, spinach, stevia,honey, matcha, and coffee.

Now the list seems to have grown so much I am afraid to eat anything different. Ive had an allergic reaction nearly everyday to something, and had to keep taking Benadryl. Now I am taking Zyrtec, just to have a ""normal"" day.

The reason I'm suspicious this is a histamine intolerance is because all of the foods I originally listed are all high histamine foods. So are a lot of the other foods I've had reactions to that I didn't list. So naturally I had to stop eating these foods because I did not want to get another reaction like how I have been. That has helped me significantly, but not totally. So, I was looking into an anti inflammatory diet before being suspicious of a histamine issue. Some of the things like cutting out dairy and gluten to lower inflammation were part of the diet, and so I did that. I think this helped me because I noticed some foods were more tolerable then than they are now, totally by accident. (I eat lots of sourdough bread) and yogurt. Now that I have them back in my diet, my reactions to foods seems to be worse. I also notice that my probiotic gives me a reaction as well.

Now I plan on trying the low histamine diet to see if it helps, I really hope it does because it is so rigerous, but it feels like I have no other choice to have a normal life again.

Also, I've had so many other weird symptoms on top of all of this:

Poor circulation Weight gain (suspected from antihistamine use) When having allergic reactions I get severe pain in my thyroid Acne which I didn't have before( started to come back during mono, has gotten worse and looks different than any acne I've had before. Back acne on the shoulders which is new) Very swollen looking, specifically my eyelids. Some urine retention. Ringing ears occasionally. Being super sensitive emotionally.

I(28F) love my family dearly and the last years I only did things I think would help them/ they wanted to do but after the 3. Big fight in a row I contemplate leaving them all but I dont know if I'm being too dramatic.

For context: I'm single (maybe aroace) and live with my parents. I work 4 days a week for 12h and babysit my cousins child(3f) the other 2 days for at least 12h(for free, I love her like shes mine so I enjoy it). My mum does all the housework and does my laundary and even makes lunch for me.
I bought my cousin the house she, her husband and child lives in but she pays me rent every month. Not to brag but without me they could not afford such a nice house and the rent is under market value. But I like having the child near me, so I dont mind that im actually losing money on the house because I have a good enough salary to support it.

Last christmas I had a huge fight with my cousins family because I bought my cousins child winter boots (with my money) which were two sizes too big. I thought they fit well because of the fluff and the child always wears two pairs socks. But they did not like this. And because a day earlier the kid wanted to wear them and when she had them on she almost (!) stumbled, they were very mad. So mad that we had a hughe verbal fight before christmas evening but we still wanted to celebrate together. But I couldnt let it go because I didnt force them to wear those shoes and because I still think its the right size, I went in a shoe shop and send them a picture of her deet measured. They got so mad that after work(half day) they went to pick up their child still sleeping next to me and throw their unwrapped christmas presents at the floor. The mum called me names in our group chat and I cried the whole christmas because I really love the child and we couldnt celebrate together.
And just because of shoes, i would not have cared if the child never wears them ans i never forced the child to wear them.
Since then I still babysit the child but I dont really hang out after work or do something together with them, only with the child.


Next is my mother who I just now got into a hughe fight.
My mum and my aunt wanted to suprise my sis (30f) who lives in the capital city roughly 5h drive away with a suprise birthday party. So I organised whith my sis bf to meet them at 15:30 at a restaurant, again as a suprise. I organised with a bakery a special cake for her and a hotel stay so my sis doesnt have anything to worry. A week before the birthday the timetable was setup. I asked my mum to be ready at 09:00 because she is always late and if she needs an additonal hour we would still make it. But she was only ready to go at 10:40. 1hour and 40min after our agreed time. We didnt talk the 5h drive except when we had to stop so my aunt could go to the toilet. I asked her for an apology so I could sweep it under the rug like all the other times her lateness crush my plans. But she said she could not apologize. I cried again but still drove on. We arrived at 16:00. So we had to akwardly suprise her in the restaurant instead with confetti and all the extra me and the bf had planned. After we finished we had to get the cake which was a suprise as well so my sis and her bf left to make their flat ready. Since the bakey was at the beginnig of the city and the city is hugh with much traffic the roundtrip was again 1h. Afterwards we had to go to hotel so we could check in because it was only possible till 20:00. Only at 21:00 we were in my sisters flat to celebrate and since her bf works really early we had to leave at 22:00. So because my mums lateness we only spent like 2h together. But I and my mum didnt show my sister that we fought and acted normal. The next day we wanted to eat breakfast together. My mum and I shared the hotel room and she began to make fun of me because I rushed her she did forget X and Y. I said I dont find that funny but she kept going until I burst outside. I waited together with my aunt who brought us coffee next to my car. When my mum came she still continued to berate me so I we fought again and i spilled her coffee on the ground so she couldnt drink it. Then she proceeded to cry and make herself the victim and said that nobody loves her and she wasted all her years. We picked up my sis to go to breakfast but ofcourse my mum did not want to go anymore so she and my aunt stayed in the car. Im sorry for my sis because we wanted to make her happy but I broughr all the drama but I just could not supress it anymore.
I have empathy for my mum because since last year my dad has maybe an affair with another woman. Since then she felt very lonely but I was alawys by her side and listend to her. Even before, because she said shes old, I went to places and vacation she wanted to go. I mean I did enjoy it too but its always my mums wishes we would do. I drive her to all her docotors appointment and to go shopping otherwise she wouldnot go outside.
But I feel like I had enough. Shes always late and says its not her fault and after she made everyone wait for her that she is still punctual because we only started after she arrived. She wanted to go to my friend baby shower togther and made me wait 2 hours for her. I only saw my friend for 2,5 hours after not seeing them for months.

And for my dad I only see him 2-3x/week although we live in the same house. I dont dislike him but he bought a restaurnt and his other company is going under water ( i already have a loan for him for about 50.000€) so we only talk about money and I end up giving him everthing I have. Its almost as if I feel indifferent about him.

I dont know what I should do.
In my heart I like all of these people but in the last time they all drove me mad.
I could leave the country and earn about 1,5-2x what I earn now but then I would be an 6 hour drive away from them. Sometimes its all I want but I know I would miss my cousins child. And I worry about my mum because when im gone I dont know who cares for her as she hasnt drove since 2001. 
But sometimes I wonder if I put my life on hold for them but I dont have any dreams I wanna achieve pr places I wanna visit.

1ir2xan,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ir2xan/not_a_normal_romhack/,Not a normal romhack,"I never should have picked it up. That's what I keep telling myself now, sitting here in the dark of my apartment, listening to the hum of my computer's cooling fan slowly die down. But how was I supposed to know? It looked so ordinary—just a black flash drive lying on the sidewalk, its scratched surface catching the late afternoon sun.

The label caught my eye first: ""Mario19.jar"" written in faded black Sharpie. As someone who grew up playing Nintendo games, I found it intriguing, but something about it felt off. I walked past it that day, trusting my instincts. That should have been the end of it.

But when I got home and found that same USB drive sitting on my desk, perfectly centered on my mousepad, I felt the first real tendril of fear curl around my spine. I live alone. My doors were locked. The windows were sealed shut—they always are, this being a third-floor apartment.

I threw it in the trash, buried it under coffee grounds and yesterday's takeout containers. I even took the garbage out, watching the dumpster lid slam shut with a sense of finality. Sleep didn't come easily that night, but eventually, exhaustion won out over anxiety.

The next morning, there it was again. Waiting. On my desk. Exactly where it had been before.

My hands trembled as I plugged it into my computer. A single folder appeared: ""Dave's USB Drive."" I didn't know any Dave. Inside were two files—a text document and the mysterious Mario19.jar. The note was simple: ""DO NOT OPEN THE FILE."" Just that. No explanation, no signature.

I'd like to say I was smart enough to listen to the warning. I wasn't.

The game looked normal at first—just another Super Mario Bros. ROM hack. But something was wrong with the colors; they seemed to shift when I wasn't looking directly at them. The music played at a slightly lower pitch than it should have, just enough to make my skin crawl.

I couldn't start a single-player game. The option was there, but clicking it did nothing. It was late when my friend Steven arrived. We sat down to play together, and the game finally allowed us to start. Everything seemed fine until World 7-2.

The screen went black. Numbers appeared in the corner, counting down from fifteen. White text against darkness, like a command prompt, but the font wasn't quite right. It looked almost handwritten.

At zero, two words appeared: ""Are you ready?""

What followed wasn't just gore or violence—it was something worse. Images that shouldn't exist, that couldn't exist. Things I recognized but shouldn't have been able to. Places I'd been but had never visited. Faces I knew but had never met.

My computer shut down on its own. Steven and I sat in silence, neither of us willing to acknowledge what we'd seen. He left shortly after, claiming he had work in the morning. I haven't heard from him since.

That was three days ago. The USB drive is gone now, but sometimes, late at night, I swear I can hear that distorted Mario theme playing faintly through my speakers—even when my computer is turned off. And every morning, my desktop background has changed to a countdown number, even though I keep changing it back.

Today it says ""2.""

I've been on Mounjaro since mid November and it's doing it's job (just went up to 7.5mg) I'm already on an SSRI, max dose, and have been for many years. It's not unusual for me to feel down this time of year regardless of circumstance. I just seem to have lost interest in everything apart from watching TV, scrolling, and petting my cat. I don't want to leave the house. 

I work from home, with the occasional day out of the house. I'm self employed and had a contract finish in December that used to get me out of the house three mornings a week. I can't seem to find anything similar to replace this and I know this is impacting me.

I used to go to the gym, but I injured myself at the beginning of January when I dropped a barbell on my hand (I've become so weak in a large calorie deficit). My hand is still a bit sore and I feel so anxious about going back when most of my muscle has disappeared in the past few months. I've lost interest in most of my other hobbies: playing piano, reading, drawing, etc. The only thing I still sort of enjoy is putting my makeup on.

I don't want to go and see friends because it feels like such a massive effort, yet I also feel lonely. I'm not interested in food and gave up drinking completely shortly before starting on MJ. My husband does his best to get me out of the house, but even going for coffee or a browse around the charity shops, isn't enjoyable anymore.

I have been diagnosed with oab since november 2023. What happened was my antidepressant (venlafaxine 225mg) was making me sweat crazily,  so I asked my doctor for help. She prescribed me oxybutinin, can't remember the dose. A few weeks later while still on the oxybutinin I kept having to pee (though only tiny amounts) and I was leaking small amounts as well. I ended up losing my then job over it, which was a blessing in disguise. My diagnosis of oab was made on the basis that I tested negative for both diabetes and a uti. I was swapped onto 5mg of solifenacin,  which later was increased to 10mg, and sent on my way, and spent about a year without another flare up, although i did still and have always needed to pee more than most, but i drink 2 cups of coffee every morning and am a small person.


In December 2024 I had another flare up, after starting spironolactone 25mg for my pcos. this time i didn't leak at all, but I had the urgency again, and my stomach/bladder area felt full and painful constantly,  sometimes with a pins and needles type feeling. I was tested for diabetes and a uti again, negative for both, swapped onto mirabegron 50mg, and booked in for a bladder and kidney ultrasound, which came back normal. 


I have been diligently bladder training since I was first diagnosed,  as I find it easier to hold it in at home, even when it gets painful, but my condition hasn't really improved. I'm a trainee teacher and I have to pee every break and lunch, which is difficult as I have to be on duty in the playground.  My last placement school were very supportive of my health issues and disabilities,  but this one isn't so much, so I feel awkward asking someone to cover my end of the playground while I pee. I also just detest how much I need the loo in general,  it's annoying as hell. Oddly I need it less at home, idk why. I will openly admit I have 2 coffees a day, and drink a fair amount of pepsi max at home, but it drives me insane how my dad can chug red bull all day and barely need to pee despite being in his 60s. I only drink as much caffeine as I do because I struggle to wake up in the morning,  and am trying to lose weight, so I use pepsi max as a replacement for sweets. Otherwise I eat healthy,  try to be active,  and do my bladder training. 


Im not sure where I can go from here, I've tried supplements but nothing works. I'm wondering if I'm dealing with something more complicated than overactive bladder, or if I just have a bad case and am unlucky. The one thing I can be grateful for in this situation is that I never really wake up to pee, I'm a very deep sleeper. I do wake up with a very full painful bladder though. Any advice would be great, doubly so from uk based practitioners,  because I live in England and there's a limit to what the nhs will provide.",1,1739740503.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Dry draw gets me cocoa, licorice, espresso and very faint barnyard. Draw feels perfect.

Upon lighting I am greeted with cocoa, espresso, mild spice, faint wood with a tiny bit of pleasant pepper and anise on the retrohale. 

Starting into the second third, the flavors are similar,  but their intensity levels have swapped a bit, with pepper mellowing on the retrohale. 
The cocoa and espresso are hiding more in the background near the wood, with spice/anise and tobacco taking the forefront.
Nuttiness way in the background. 
About halfway through the second third and the spice on the retrohale is lovely.

Getting into the final third and the cocoa/espresso is pretty much gone, pepper has picked up a bit, a little earth, leather and mineral have joined the party. 
I am getting a smidge of a bitter note. Probably tar burning, but it was short lived. Nothing a little coffee can't fix.
We've moved into full flavored territory.  Cocoa comes back a bit down to the nub.

This is a great smoke. I rate it highly at 8.3/10, which is probably more like a 9.3/10 for most, as my highest rated smoke is a 9/10. I'm  always leaving room in my ratings for when I find the perfect smoke.

Definitely want to keep more in the humidor and will add a few to my next order.

1ir2sa1,https://www.reddit.com/r/davidlynch/comments/1ir2sa1/inland_empire_is_a_masterpiece/,Inland Empire is a masterpiece,"If I had enough time I could write essays on how amazing this movie is. There is something so obscure about it, and I have never seen a movie that feels like it goes so far down a rabbit hole. I’m interested in hearing other takes and crazy ideas inspired by and about the film.

My take that I haven’t heard is that Axonn N. Is a radio drama on record (as shown in the opening sequence) and the overlying structural frame for the story. Linear Timelines moving in a spiraling pattern like the grooves of a record, with different ideas reincarnated across multiple go arounds (like tracks in a record). This will come back. The initial archetype from which all the following stories spawns is the dynamic of the whore, as shown in the opening segment after the record is shown. This is a dynamic that concerns femininity, what it means to be a human being, power dynamics between genders, etc. The Lost Girl is one archetype down in this metaphysical hierarchy. This archetype spins out into the more complex story of Laura Derns character, which largely concerns gender dynamics in Hollywood, marital infidelity, sexuality, etc. Laura Dern must transcend this archetype, but in the process she becomes ‘lost in the marketplace’ (a quote directly from Maharishi, reading up on what the quote means and its context helps understand this segment of the movie), and must escape through ‘The Alleyway’. We see this play out in Derns dream, and in the alleyway she finds the door labeled Axonn N. 

These doors act as passageways above the metaphysical record spiral structure of the narrative and offer a way to ‘skip’ into a new iteration (like a record player skipping accross a groove to a new track if we follow the record analogy). Like lifting the needle up on a record player, coincidentally these doors seem to always led to a staircase leading UP, and allows Laura Dern to see the inner workings behind her wider journey to transcendence (through many lifetimes, attempting to shed the archetype of the whore). 

Unfortunately, in messing with the structures excessively (coming into contact with lost girl and attempting to use fire to manipulate the overlying structure of her story) Laura Dern becomes lost in something far bigger and scarier on her path (the final steps are always the darkest), she becomes lost within these multiple layers of reality and incarnation, film and reality, Poland and Hollywood, moving closer and closer to a true understanding of her archetypal self (whore) before she will shed it and find transcendence. When she finally is on the street, strung out and now an actually, no metaphor whore, her sense of self can truly die, before the camera pulls back and we can begin to shed all these metaphysical layers (again- film, timeline, country). She has broken the cycle of reincarnation that was tainted by murder and this deadly archetype playing out repeatedly. We see an addition struggle/success in this regard when she faces off with the phantom. 

I should also address the rabbits- it is just another reiteration of these archetypes. This time with two women and a man, we see a total simplification of the potential dynamics of a three person interaction, which in other iterations plays out with jealousy, sexual infidelity, and murder. 

There is so much more in this movie that I could talk about. I’ll also defend the visuals a bit- David Lynch is clearly playing with the way different textures interact with digital cameras and different effects in editing. David edited the whole film himself digitally, and you can tell he used certain filters and effects that accentuates strange grains and movements in patterns. It is extremely trippy and just adds to the feeling that the movie is pulling you down a hole. 

I feel that many people misconstrue that all of David Lynch’s beloved ideas (which he clearly has an abundance of and tries to never forget) are all extremely grand conceptual ideas. I bet they are often technical filmmaking concepts, like ‘I wonder how the autofocus will effect the textures in this mansion and then I wonder how quickly following a close up of a face to the pouring of coffee will appear on a digital camera’ and then he lets them play out. Inland empire is a lot of that kind of improvisation, but I think he had some solid framework in his mind of what was going to be conceptually important this piece. 

Clearly multiple realities, archetypes, and characters shedding these layers to get closer to the truth was on his mind, as he explores it extremely in depth in Twin Peaks The Return a few years later (his greatest masterpiece, along with Blue Velvet IMO).

What do you think about Inland Empire?! 
Rest In Peace David Lynch. Not a day goes by since I first watched twin peaks that I don’t think about his art.

As a photography enthusiast and someone deeply interested in rural lifestyles, I was eager to find a beautiful ancient village to photograph and explore. After researching, I finally settled on a destination - Azheke Mushroom Village in Yunnan, China.

A Hidden Pearl of the World, a Millennium - Old Ancient Village

I arrived at Azheke Village in July 2024. The moment I got there, I was deeply shocked by the scene before my eyes. The forest above the village and the terraced fields below were both a beautiful emerald green, echoing each other from afar. Azheke Village was like a beautiful gem sandwiched in between, so simple and charming.

https://preview.redd.it/khpyrt99gkje1.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b7dfc78f5d2fcd5207dfee4636bb18e6cb5ad6a

There is a 30 yuan (about 4 US dollars) entrance fee to enter the village, and this money will be distributed to every villager to encourage the development of this traditional village.

Conforming to Nature, a Unique Village Layout

Out of considerations for feng shui (a traditional Chinese culture that believes that the layout of houses or nature can affect fortune), the trees in the village are not arranged in a strictly regular pattern, and houses are built to avoid trees. The villagers in Azheke Village do not cut down trees on their own initiative but take good care of them.

https://preview.redd.it/mr7wzryagkje1.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0e61aad868326c9fa4fa175c6c6519825f5b566

Therefore, we can see the scene of humans and nature living in harmony here, which makes me, who has lived in the city for a long time, feel relaxed and leads me to integrate into nature. And the villagers naturally do their own things beside the houses.

You can even see the chickens leisurely running up the trees.

Through the Ages, the Unchanging Mushroom Houses

In Azheke Village, the most distinctive thing is the houses where the villagers live, called mushroom houses. The main body of these houses is made of earth mounds and stones, and the roofs are covered with thatch, looking just like mushrooms in the Yunnan forest.

https://preview.redd.it/snbs3bkggkje1.png?width=870&format=png&auto=webp&s=76aa355f11bb63d50bb6952c85e144aa02d122c3

In terms of house design, due to the humid climate in Yunnan, a stove is often designed in the house to balance the air humidity.

https://preview.redd.it/vgls0l0igkje1.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=5364cbc4390889518e78df1f9b246147c9cb9704

The heat will pass through the wooden floor to the thatched roof and then pass through it, allowing the indoor air to circulate. In addition, when the sun is out, the thatched roof can absorb the heat from the sun well. After learning about these situations, I can't help but admire the wisdom of these villagers. It is precisely this wisdom that has helped these villagers overcome difficulties and develop in harmony with nature until today.

The Vicissitudes of Time, Tradition or Modernization?

I chatted with an old lady on the roadside. She told me that many people in the mountain villages of Yunnan have left the village to seek opportunities for a living in big cities. And everything I saw in Azheke Village was no longer what it used to be. Restaurants, coffee shops, and homestays have been opened in the village one after another.

https://preview.redd.it/h2o8ff4lgkje1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d8d19ded23d3e7783da957cfa48ec1d8d5f4738

Although the emergence of these things has left commercial marks on Azheke Village, in the face of the changes of the times, I think this may be the best choice. If there were no commercial options, the departure of people would deal a fatal blow to the village. Without people, the village would lose its meaning. Fortunately, I can still see all this happening in front of me, which brings some comfort to my stressful life.

Some Suggestions

Since I visited in July, the terraced fields presented a visual effect like a green ocean to me.

https://preview.redd.it/t6s73c8ngkje1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e4e7e9d5c5571b3e25b5da6e56825146f266014

If you come from November to February, you will be greeted by the mirror-like terraced fields.

Try the local farm-raised native chickens here. The mellow chicken soup and firm chicken meat helped me escape the confinement of industrial food and showed me what real good food is.

Background: Last school year, as a junior, I was able to significantly improve my score by retaking it only once, with only about a month in between the tests, after spending a decent amount of time and effort studying and practicing. I attend a very small rural school (no AP classes, no honors classes, hardly any funding, inexperienced and ill-equipped teachers), which consistently scores low on the test (my class of about 25 students had an average score of 16.8) which means that I wasn’t super well equipped for the test compared to many students at other schools. My family is pretty poor and we weren't able to pay for many resources or fancy tutoring, so I borrowed an ACT practice booklet and found free resources online. Despite this, I was able to increase my composite score by 7 points to a score above the 95th percentile nationally! (This means I scored within the top 5% of everyone who took the test in the United States)

To all of those wishing to improve your score from the 17-21 range to somewhere slightly more competitive/college-ready (I would say a good spot to aim would be a 23-27, depending on your choice of college and what scholarships you're aiming for) it is much easier than you might think. Often, the difference between the score you have and a good baseline score for college is only a small handful of questions correct (google and look at a raw score sheet to see specific numbers). With a little bit of improved strategy, a few practice tests, and some helpful tips you can increase your score!

Here’s basic tips that can hopefully help:

* Don’t go back and forth on every question filling in bubbles- circle your answers on the booklet/test itself, and when you reach the bottom of the page (or the bottom of the passage, depending on what test you’re on) fill in all of your answers. If you’ve temporarily skipped a question (which I encourage) be careful to skip it on the scantron too- just make sure to fill it in later.
* If you are having trouble on the math section, look up “full ACT math test walkthrough” on YouTube and watch it while working out the problems along with the video. 
* On Math, make sure to use an approved calculator that you are familiar with. If you don't own one or don't want to buy a stupid $100 calculator, you can probably borrow one from your school, a nerdy friend, a public library in some cases, or you can rent one for a semester! If none of these options work for you, still bring one of those simpler approved non-graphing calculators- it's a lot better than nothing.
* Have basic math formulas and concepts memorized (circumference of a circle, area of shapes, SOHCAHTOA, slope, Pythagorean theorem, the different between mean median mode range, etc.) There are many formula sheets available online if you look, even on this sub!
* Make sure to fill in every single bubble on the scantron. If you do have to quickly randomly guess on a few questions, fill in the same bubble for each (ex. choose all C).
* To increase your chances of guessing a question you aren't confident on or don't know, cancel out options you know aren't correct and guess from there.
* On the Reading section there are 4 passages (labeled at the top)- complete the Natural Science one FIRST. It is usually at the end of the test, and takes the longest of every section, and can make you panic or preemptively guess, especially if you're running out of time at the end of the test.
* Don't be afraid to skip questions. On Math, I encourage that you take two sweeps through the test- go through the test once, doing the easier questions and marking the harder ones/the ones you don't know. Once you reach the end, go back and do the harder questions, and strategically guess on the ones you don't know. On Reading and Science, feel free to skip around only within the passage/section you are on- I suggest answering every question the first time around so you don't have to waste time re-familiarizing yourself on a section. For the English, just make sure you are skimming/getting the basic gist of the article you are correcting since they will ask you questions about it at the end.
* On Math, if you don't know how to find an answer by the question alone, try and backsolve: use the multiple choice answers and go through each seeing if that option could possibly be correct.
* On English, Reading, and Science, absolutely underline and circle details that you think are important, in the text and in the questions.
* On English, choose the most concise, precise, accurate option that conforms with what the article is likely trying to convey. Make sure that your grammar corrections  are correct within the full sentence itself- sometimes there is spacing (or even a page divide) breaking up a sentence, and this can trip you up if you don't notice. 
* On Reading, read the passage before answering questions, but try to spend no longer than 3-4 minutes reading the passage itself- get the basic gist of the passage, and understand basically what the purpose of the article is and the points it's making. Spend most of your available time (about 8-9 minutes per passage) trying to answer the questions. Some people find it helpful to skim the questions before reading the passage, if this works well for you, absolutely go for it!
* On Science, briefly skim over the diagrams/info for 30 or less seconds (unless it is the passage section, read through that quickly 1-2 minutes), then go straight to the questions. The Science section is specifically designed to overwhelm you: do not be deceived, the answer is usually much simpler than you think, just pay attention to what exactly is being asked and look back and forth specifically at the diagrams/charts provided, and exactly what is referred to in the question. Try and understand the basics of what the information is supposed to mean in simple terms. Look for high and low points on the graphs, and understand the difference between an independent and dependent variable.
* On the ACT, pacing is very important. Make sure when practicing to go through the test with the same time limit you will have at the actual test. If having a timer doesn't freak you out, bring a watch or stopwatch so you can keep track of time (just make sure it doesn't make noise, and that it doesn't connect to internet).
* If you struggle most on a certain test, practice that one most, look for specific weaknesses, and find tips and advice that works for you. It'll be tough, but I promise that if you keep at it you can get better!
* If you want to take or retake the ACT but think you can't afford it, see if you are eligible for an ACT Fee Waiver; look at the requirements on ACT's website, and talk to your high school counselor (who might be able to provide you with other free resources anyway).
* Get a good night's sleep TWO DAYS before you take the test. Eat a full breakfast with carbs and protein, and if it doesn't make you anxious or shaky, have a little bit of caffeine (a cup of coffee or less should be enough). Don't study much the day before the test, try to take a break and relax so you are energized and rejuvenated on test day.
* Bring a snack and water to the test, you'll be there forever and you'll definitely need a little pick-me-up.
* If you feel a test has gone worse than you hoped, don't sweat it too much, after all, ACT scores aren't everything, and just maybe, you'll do better than you think- when I took my last test, I thought I did badly, but instead, I got the best score anyone from my school has gotten within at least the last 15 years.

I am approaching 8 weeks pregnant. I've ALWAYS been an avid iced latte girl. I'd have a cup every single day. I've finally hit the point of not being able to stomach coffee at all. I can take a couple sips before getting nauseated. Same goes for tea. I can drink a little bit but shortly after, my stomach just turns. I used to LOVE both tea and coffee so so much, so this is wild for me. 

Today, I had a caffeine headache and caved and had the first Redbull I've had in years but man, it went down smooth lol. Obviously I know Redbull isn't ideal and I shouldn't be drinking them regularly, so I'm looking for any alternatives.

1ir2ito,https://www.reddit.com/r/arabs/comments/1ir2ito/how_to_make_a_dictator_101/,How to make a dictator 101,"In the early hours of July 14, 1958, in the ancient city of Baghdad, the streets were quiet as usual. A small café owner in the bustling downtown finished his Fajr prayer, returned to his shop, swept the dust, brewed tea and coffee, and adjusted a portrait of King Faisal II. The king was set to marry an Egyptian princess that day, and the city was preparing for celebrations, until the radio crackled with an unexpected announcement:

""In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, Dear People, With the support of the patriotic armed forces, we have liberated our beloved homeland from the corrupt clique imposed by colonial powers. The army, from you and for you, has removed the oppressors who trampled your rights. Now, stand with us to protect this victory from conspiracies.""

The café owner froze, then swiftly tore down the king’s portrait, smashing the glass. He switched to ""Voice of the Arabs,"" playing one of Umm Kulthum's revolutionary songs. He hid his medals and rushed outside to join the crowds chanting, ""Long live the revolution!"" and ""Death to Nuri the Tyrant!""   
  
The news spread fast, King Faisal was dead, the royal palace looted. The café owner, though shedding a tear for the young king's tragic fate, who he thought was the hope of this nation, found new hope in a man he had never heard of: Abdulkarim Qassim. A leader praised as humble and brave, born to a simple family. In celebration, the café owner served free tea to his customers and returned home. His wife, beaming with joy, offered his favorite okra soup. Yet, despite his excitement, he declined and went to bed.

The next morning, he awoke to a transformed Baghdad, once peaceful streets were stained with blood. Neighbors were labeled enemies of the revolution, officials from his district were dragged into trucks and beggar children peddled photos of a stern-faced military man: Abdulkarim Qassim. The café owner purchased a photo and replaced the king’s portrait with it, telling himself, “What harm could it bring?”

A couple weeks later, parades filled the streets, men and women waving banners for the “Sole Leader,” the man who, as rumors claimed, had shrunk his portrait but made bread bigger. Yet, to the café owner, the bread felt the same. Promises filled the air, oil nationalization, land reforms, but little changed. Women gained new legal rights, but Umm Kulthum and ""Voice of the Arabs"" disappeared from the airwaves. When he asked why, officers told him that Umm Kulthum and even local singer Afifa Iskandar were banned as enemies of the revolution. Undeterred, he paid a young musician for a live performance at his café. His wife once more prepared his favorite okra soup, but he declined again, his appetite fading.

As the months passed, the nation unraveled, a failed coup in Mosul, revolts in the north and south, and growing whispers of Kurdish rebellion. The Sole Leader barely and bravely survived an assassination attempt. Yet, the café owner remained steadfast, serving his patrons and chanting for Qassim, hopeful it was all just a stroke of bad luck. One evening, as he closed shop, the young musician approached, panic in his eyes. His cousin, accused of plotting against Qassim, had been arrested. The musician begged for shelter. But loyalty to the revolution overruled compassion. The café owner refused and called for the police. The musician fled, and the café owner returned home, his wife offering okra soup once more. He refused, saying he had no taste for it.

Years passed, and Baghdad grew colder. Relations with Arab neighbors crumbled over Kuwait. The Kurdish conflict drained the army, and prices soared. Yet, the café owner bought a new invention: a television. But revolution gripped the city again. Protests, clashes, and chaos, this time against the Sole Leader. On a cold February day, tanks rolled through Baghdad. General Abdul Salam Arif, once Qassim’s ally, led a coup. Communist defenders resisted but fell. As the café owner watched his show, the broadcast was cut short. Qassim appeared on screen, this time bloody, cold and lifeless.

The café owner stared in silence, then, without hesitation, tore down the portrait of the former Sole Leader and smashed it to the ground, He switched to ""Voice of the Arabs,"" playing one of Mohammed Abdulwahab's Pan-Arabist songs. He hid his medals. He stepped outside and joined the chanting crowds:

1ir2itm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Darkness_WithIn6833/comments/1ir2itm/fractured_between_us/,Fractured Between Us,"The house had finally settled into silence, but I could still feel the tension clinging to the air like humidity before a storm. I sat at the kitchen table, my fingers tracing idle patterns on the rim of my coffee mug, my thoughts too restless to settle.

I had known this wouldn’t be easy. Balancing love between two men came with its own set of complications, but this—this rift forming between them—was something I hadn’t been prepared for.

My husband wanted a friendship. He had said it so plainly, so sincerely, that my heart ached at the quiet frustration in his voice. I don’t want to be just the guy you tolerate because of her. He wasn’t wrong to want that. The idea of the two of them getting along had been a hope of mine from the beginning. A dream of sorts, where we could be a unit, even if their connection was built on nothing more than mutual respect and shared space.

But my boyfriend… he had made it clear where he stood.

I’m not here to be his friend.

I pressed my lips together, staring at the swirl of steam rising from my coffee. He wasn’t cruel about it, just firm. Distant. The lines he drew weren’t out of spite, but they were lines all the same. And now, those boundaries were causing friction, pulling me in two different directions.

The front door clicked open, and I glanced up, watching my husband step inside. His expression was unreadable, but the way his shoulders were set told me enough. Another failed attempt. Another tense conversation. I didn’t even have to ask.

He let out a slow breath, rubbing a hand down his face before meeting my eyes.

“I don’t think this is going to change,” he admitted. There was no anger in his voice, just quiet resignation.

I swallowed, my throat tight. “I know.”

He nodded, his gaze searching mine for something—reassurance, maybe. A promise that this wouldn’t break anything that mattered.

And it wouldn’t. It couldn’t.

But as the door closed behind him, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the ground beneath us had become a little less steady.

I stayed at the table long after he left the room, my fingers tightening around the mug as if I could anchor myself with the warmth. But warmth wasn’t the problem.

The problem was the distance growing between them.

I understood why my husband wanted a friendship—he was steady, open-hearted, the kind of man who liked to build bridges instead of walls. And I understood why my boyfriend didn’t—he was guarded, careful, someone who only let people in on his own terms.

Neither of them were wrong. But that didn’t make this any easier.

I sighed and pushed the mug away, standing just as I heard the quiet creak of the bedroom door down the hall. A few seconds later, my boyfriend stepped into the kitchen, his hair slightly damp from a shower, his expression unreadable.

He didn’t look at me right away, instead moving toward the fridge, the small movements of normalcy making my chest ache. I wanted normalcy too. I wanted to wake up in the morning and not feel the weight of this tension pressing down on us.

“You’re quiet,” I said softly.

He exhaled through his nose, reaching for a bottle of water. “Nothing to say.”

That wasn’t true. He had plenty to say—he just wasn’t saying it.

I hesitated, then took a step closer. “He’s trying, you know.”

Now he looked at me, his jaw tightening. “I never asked him to.”

I swallowed, nodding. I knew that. My husband knew that. But it didn’t change the fact that he wa nted to.

“I just…” I ran a hand over my face, trying to find the right words. “I don’t need you two to be best friends. I don’t need you to change how you feel. I just…” I sighed. “I don’t want this to turn into something we can’t come back from.”

His shoulders tensed, and for a moment, I thought he’d brush it off, retreat behind the wall he kept between himself and my husband. But then he set the water down and leaned against the counter, crossing his arms.

“I’m not trying to start a fight with him,” he said after a pause. “I just… don’t see the point.”

I nodded slowly, studying him. “What if the point is me?”

That made him pause. His fingers tapped against his bicep, his gaze flickering to the table before settling back on me. “I already give you what I can,” he said quietly. “I don’t know if I can give more.”

Something in my chest clenched at the honesty in his voice. He wasn’t shutting me out—he was telling me his truth. And maybe that was the real problem. Not that he didn’t want a friendship, but that he couldn’t give that part of himself, even if he wanted to.

And if that was the case… was I asking too much?

I took a slow breath and nodded. “Okay.”

His brow furrowed slightly, like he hadn’t expected me to accept that so easily. Maybe I hadn’t expected it either. But pushing would only make the distance grow, and I didn’t want that.

I reached for his hand, squeezing it gently. “I just needed to know where you stood.”

He hesitated, then squeezed back. “I’m here. That hasn’t changed.”

And maybe that was enough. Maybe I just had to trust that we’d find our balance, even if the ground still felt unsteady beneath our feet.

That night, I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, the weight of it all pressing against my ribs. My husband’s even breathing filled the room, steady and familiar, but I felt anything but steady.

I had tried to be understanding. I had listened to both of them, let them set their boundaries, respected the space between them. But no matter how rational I tried to be, the ache in my chest wouldn’t go away.

I wanted this to work. Not just for them—for me.

I had dreamed of something easier, something softer. A love that felt like home no matter where I turned. I hadn’t expected them to be inseparable, but I had hoped, deep down, that they would find common ground. That the man I built a life with and the man I fell in love with later could at least see each other, not just as obstacles, but as two pieces of something that mattered.

But that wasn’t happening. And every day it chipped away at something inside me.

I felt like I was being split in two. With my husband, I could feel the quiet disappointment, the way he wanted to reach out but kept his distance because he didn’t want to push. With my boyfriend, I could feel the wall between us growing thicker every time the topic came up, every time my husband made another small attempt and was met with indifference.

And I was in the middle. Always in the middle.

The worst part was that I understood both of them, which meant there was no one to blame. No villain to point at. Just a quiet, gnawing grief that neither of them would see the things I saw—that my husband was patient and kind and deserved to be more than tolerated, and that my boyfriend was careful and protective of his own space because the world ha d never been gentle with him.

I turned onto my side, curling in on myself, my eyes stinging. I had asked for this. Chosen this. And I didn’t regret it. I couldn’t regret it, because I loved them both too much.

But love wasn’t enough to make them love each other.

And that was breaking me in ways I didn’t know how to fix.",1,1739739783.0,u_Darkness_WithIn6833,0,1.0,False

Recently my wife and I have started a D&D group through a nonprofit where we play and host games at public venues. So far we've only been able to play at the library, but we can only do that once a month and the availability we have limits us to Mondays, which isn't an ideal time for many members of our group. 

Does anyone know where I can find a place that would give us the space to host weekend games (Sunday, ideally)? Since we're doing this through a nonprofit we don't really have the means to rent out a space (we've looked at UL which is very expensive). What we can offer is that if a local business would be willing to donate the space, that could be written off, and we'd also be bringing in potential customers (like if it was a coffee shop or something). Ideally we'd want a space that's fairly spacious and can provide tables and seating.

We cruise several times a year on Carnival on the west coast. We'd usually get 2 or 3 each, per day, usually a ""grande vanilla latte with TWO PUMPS of vanilla."" (If you don't specify 2 pumps they will use 4, and it's waaay too sweet.) They were always rather delicious. (Chastise us all you want about the syrup, and then GTFO.)

On 1/6/25 we got our very first machine delivered and for a month we had 2 or 3 lattes per day using organic Monin vanilla syrup. We also have dark chocolate and caramel, all from Monin, purchased directly from Monin, not Amazon. Of course at home we only use 1 pump cuz on the ship I think they use a quad shot for the Grande. We use beans we get from a local roaster that we've used for years. We're very happy with our home setup and coffee experience, even as we strive for better consistency.

On 2/7/25 we boarded the Carnival Firenze, which we've sailed on 4 times prior within the last 8 months. After a few sips my wife and I were looking at each other, like, ""is something off about your latte?"" The lattes were nasty, acrid, like saccharine. They have several lovely La Cimbali and FAEMA machines throughout the Italian-themed ship. We can't figure out why theses coffees, this time only, were undrinkable. We ordered them from different bars and shops around the ship, all had the same artificial-sweetener aftertaste. We wondered if we've completely destroyed our palates by doing our lattes at home. We asked if anything had changed recently with the machines or their syrups or whatever, and came up with nothing, We basically gave up caffeine on board and just drank alcohol (and water of course, you know, for health!). Still had a great time but this was confusing. (PS their regular pot-brewed coffee has always sucked; sometimes it just brownish water with a coffee tint, sometimes it's essentially Turkish, so we don't bother. And with the drinks package the ""specialty coffees"" are included free.) 

We'll be on the Carnival Panorama next month and are curious if this same phenomenon will present itself.

My phone reminded me that today had been one year since I've started on Mounjaro 7.5; there was no starter dose. Just jump right in.

Before I had started, I was really trying to lose weight, as I had hit an all-time high of 250 when I went to see my endocrinologist. My A1C had jumped to 7.1, And I was just going downhill. I had managed to get down to 235, but I was depressed that I could not get my diet under control. Because I couldn't stop thinking about food. I would lay in bed with a full stomach and just want to eat. If I was stressed at work, I would run to the vending machine or the coffee shop downstairs.  

I asked him about Ozempic, as I had not heard of Mounjaro; at first, he was trying to push another medication, but my mind was made up. So he said, ""Okay, well, I have been hearing better results with a GLP-1 called Mounjaro; let's see how it goes."" I agreed, and next, I think before my first dosage. I looked for a subreddit to see what others had to say. I read up about ensuring I had enough protein, fiber, and water and looked for what others recommended. If a lot of people seem to endorse something, I figure  I should give those a try. 

After my first shot, the food noise was gone. With that, I was able to look up how much I should eat to lose 1lb a week. And I started to log everything. I got a food scale and have become neurotic.

I have 25 more lbs to go, which has slowed once the water weight and inflammation have normalized. But still have the sweet, sweet relief from food noise.  No going up in dosage. All my medications have been reduced or dropped altogether. My last A1C was 5.7.  I just got my eyes checked, the Dr said they looked better. (Still blind as a bat without  glasses, MJ can't fix a lifetime of being nearsighted)

I am a Mj fan. I tell people ever chance I can about it and the upcoming possibilities of GLP-1. I have never hide that the drug gave me the strength to get my life in order. I wish more people could reap it's benefits. I understand some people think it a private thing, but I welcome changing a skeptic's mind. If someone else think that I am cheating to lose weight.

1ir2cnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1ir2cnl/any_advice_appreciated_day_17/,Any advice appreciated - Day 17 🙏🏻,"Day 17 of strict carnivore. M48, Went mainly keto for 1-2 weeks before starting. Doing this for my health (not weight loss) as I’ve suffered from gut issues like ibs & OAB for years. 

Close mate told me to test out carnivore. I use to be an athlete from teenager to 30 years old, I like simplicity & I’m very disciplined. I usually exercise 3-6 x week, 10K+ steps day, & I thought I was eating ‘healthy’ living on moderate meat, very high vege & fruit, + grain diet. 

The issue I’m finding is my usual high energy is gone! 1st week was ok.. but the last week until today has been awful! I could literally fall asleep to sleep anytime as I’m so tired! My research so far (this forum, Ken berry, Anthony chafee, etc advises to increase my fat %.. which I am doing with more butter & egg yolks. 

I’m eating 3 x day (as I don’t want to lose anymore weight (5ft 11, 167pds). 
Keeping good water intake & taking electrolytes twice a day. Typical breakfast is either 2 egg omelette with butter, cheese, or ~300g ground beef with cheese, butter. Lunch is similar to breakfast, & dinner usually is similar to or involves steak & eggs  (for something nicer at dinner). ~4-5 eggs total daily & ~500-600g beef daily (ground beef is lean) so I add butter.. ~100g butter daily total. Drink only water - I cut out coffee (months ago) & I’ve given up alcohol months ago to sleep better. 

I’m reaching out for any suggestions to try.. as my energy is flat / sleepy / tired I can’t concentrate / can’t even work… also I know things aren’t right as I usually lift weights 3-4 x week (most often hard & heavy) right now my workouts are so Dailed back on intensity as I don’t have the usual drive. Sleep has also turned to shit.. which isn’t helping..  tallow isn’t available where I live.. steak has mainly been sirloin however I will try & find fattier cuts. 

I definitely don’t want to quit.. hard to describe just how far this is different from normal motivated driven self.. my initial goal is 30days then another 30days. I haven’t tried any organ meat yet (can’t find in supermarkets). Any suggestions would be appreciated.. 

I’m open to try anything right now.. other than electrolytes (morning & afternoon) I take magnesium glycinate to help my sleep, take nothing else other than water. I add salt to my water & all meals. I start each day hoping this will be the day my body is finally fat adapted :) thank you 🙏🏻

Been here for 7 months, and despite my best efforts (running groups, pubs, Bumble, and Meetup cults) I’ve had about as much success making friends as a penguin in the Sahara. Maybe it’s the culture, maybe it’s the fast-paced lifestyle, or maybe there’s a secret Swiss conspiracy keeping me out of their perfectly organized social circles.

I’m not a musician, I don’t have a crypto podcast, and I definitely don’t go cross-country skiing at 5 AM on a Wednesday to “start the day with energy.” Just a regular guy who enjoys the outdoors, hiking, spontaneous weekend trips, movies, and a good beer or coffee—without needing to schedule it three weeks in advance.

If you’re an Expat/Swiss/Alien in the same boat and want to meet people without it feeling like a job interview, drop a message. Maybe we’ll hit it off and this could be the start of a great friendship… or at least a solid excuse to grab a drink and complain about how hard it is to make friends here. 🍻

1ir2abh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bellingham/comments/1ir2abh/how_do_i_make_friends_how_do_i_make_community/,"“How do I make friends,” + “How do I make community” master thread","Not sure if this qualifies as a ""rant"" but at least once a week I’m scrollin’ the Bham subreddit only to find a “I’m moving here and working remote for a tech company in Denver with my dog, Luna, and I WaNt To KnOw HoW tO mAkE cOmMuNiTy” kind of post. (I also see y’all regular folks wanting to know, but let’s be real, the former is much more fun to make fun of). 

As much as I understand these posts / relate with the struggle of making friends, the same advice is given on almost every thread so I’ve taken it upon myself to gather a master thread with links to groups and resources. So here goes— **how do you make friends / community in Bellingham?** 

**Some background**: why are people here so weird / unfriendly? 

* many experts/travel bloggers attribute the PNW weirdness to the year-round grey weather and the “invasion of big tech” (yeahhhh lookin’ at you remote workers). 
* BUT there’s a bigger, more historical system in play— the large settlements of nordic immigrants (see this article https://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/washington/seattle/experiences/news/theres-a-brutal-heatwave-in-the-pacific-northwest-so-whats-this-about-a-seattle-freeze) 
* TL;DR —> it is real since the 1920s, but in almost every thread in this subreddit, folks say it’s become more of a stereotype of the PNW than a reality. People are nice, but you have to give the energy you want to receive, **community takes work.** 

**How to make friends:** 

1. **Get on Bumble Bff**— some folks have great luck, others don’t. If you’re a woman you will probably have better luck, but this is a great starting point to start and find some other lonely friends. Yeah, finding friends on an app is weird, but people do it and there’s been many success stories noted in this thread. 
2. **if you are outdoorsy**… 
   1. **Join some Facebook group**s like
      1. Bellingham Leisurely Hikes + Walks
      2. Bellingham Outdoor women 
      3. Sisterhood of the Trail, was previously “hot girl walks.” 
      4. Greater Bellingham Running club 
   2. **Join the Fairhaven run club** (guess what?! they have a walking group!!). They basically run / walk in one direction for 20 minutes, and then back for 20, then go to Stones Throw for beers on Tuesdays. 
   3. **Join the Mt Baker club meet up group** (https://www.meetup.com/mountbakerclub/) to go on outings— you do have to pay, but membership dues are pretty cheap ($20). 
   4. **Whatcom mountain biking coalition** doesn’t directly organize outings BUT they do have a facebook page where people find other folks to ride with (https://www.wmbcmtb.org/ ) 
3. **If you are not outdoorsy**
   1. **There’s still facebook groups for that including…**
      1. Bellingham Artists Collective 
      2. Bellingham Queer Collective 
      3. Bellingham People for Shows 
      4. Bellingham gamers meet up
      5. Bellingham Hub — has a super large membership with LOTS of posts about different happenings.
   2. **Bellingham “play book”** (https://cob.org/services/recreation/activities/playbook) that they release quarterly
      1. They have a variety of classes that are pretty cheap— from dancing, to watercolor, to bird watching, you can join a class, meet a person who is also attending that class, and BAM there you go, friends!
   3. **Whatcom continuing education courses** — similar to playbook, they have pretty cheap classes every quarter that cover watercolor, pottery, creative writing, etc. they publish on their website. 
   4. **Trivia + Bingo**— there is trivia, EVERYWHERE around town almost any night of the week. Overflow on Mondays, Schweinhaus on Wednesdays, Bingo on Thursdays at Flatstick— pick a 5 bars at random, there is probably 1 of them that has trivia going on. Make a team from folks in those FB groups, Bumble BFF, or hell, if you're super bold show up and ask to join a table.
   5. **Events at businesses**— there are a variety of events that happen weekly / monthly at bars or other businesses across Whatcom county including… 
      1. Nelsons Monday board game nights (https://www.cascadiadaily.com/2024/jan/27/nelsons-market-owners-want-to-run-restaurant-like-good-neighbors/) 
      2. Corner Tap house weekly Bingo, trivia, book club meetups (https://www.cornertaphouse.com/#events) 
      3. 1 up gaming lounge cosplay party last saturday of every month (https://www.1-uplounge.com/ )
      4. Makers Space Free crafting time on Saturdays (https://bellinghammakerspace.org/events/) 
      5. Village books book clubs (https://www.villagebooks.com/category/event-type/book-groups)

**How to make Community**: 

**“what is ‘making community’?” —> some good readings to get you started:** 

* “I’m starting to think you guys don’t want a village” [https://slate.com/life/2024/11/parenting-advice-friends-loneliness-village.html](https://slate.com/life/2024/11/parenting-advice-friends-loneliness-village.html) 
* “Forge Lifelong Connections and Support\*\*”\*\* [https://medium.com/@freshhotdata/building-your-tribe-forge-lifelong-connections-and-support-in-your-20s-4bb7b6e80dc2](https://medium.com/@freshhotdata/building-your-tribe-forge-lifelong-connections-and-support-in-your-20s-4bb7b6e80dc2) 
   * If you’re reading this thread saying “ugh I am too busy” or “gosh it is so much WORK to make friends and volunteer” then sorry, you don’t want to **build** a community, you want a community built for you that you want to reap the benefits of (don’t we all lol). 

**Easy-Mode**:

* Stay informed on what is going on— whether it is in this sub reddit, following the local news papers, or casually scrolling Whatcom county Brit list, being informed goes a longgg way / is the first step in being involved. 
* Join your neighborhood's “buy nothing” group— each neighborhood has a buy nothing group on Facebook, and it is a great place to find free stuff, but also loan out various items to your neighbors (i.e. humidifiers when your neighbor has sick kiddos, a book you have a neighbor wants to read, etc.). 
* Join “nextdoor” in your neighborhood to stay informed on what's going on in your immediate area 
* Consistently go to the same places each week— go to the same grocery store, same coffee shop, same bar and become a regular— this is how MANY of us have made friends, and the industry workers here are a very tight knit and cool community of folks. Leave nice tips, make small talk, do this every week to start to establish you’re a part of the community
   * Note— I am not saying be a creep, or take advantage of service workers kindness (we are paid to be nice to you), BUT **people like nice peopl**e, so be nice consistently and you’ll get into the good graces of the places you frequent. 

**Moderate-Mode**: 

* Become a donor to one of our MANY non profits (https://greatnonprofits.org/city/bellingham/WA), listen if you work in tech where your employer does not pay taxes to Bellingham, you should probably consider donating IMO. 
* Become a one-time volunteer for an event or a work party— (https://cob.org/gov/public/volunteer/parks-volunteer/volunteer-work-parties ) work parties help keep our parks free of invasive species, help with the salmon run, restoration, you name it! As for events, you can volunteer at Bellingham Seafest, Ski to Sea, or others— you can find different volunteer opportunities here [https://whatcomvolunteer.galaxydigital.com/event/](https://whatcomvolunteer.galaxydigital.com/event/) 
* Host some neighbors for dinner or a BBQ

**“hard”-Mode** (“hard” in quotes because it is a higher level of effort, but idk doing work for your community is sick / rewarding so not really “hard” you know?). 

* become a consistent volunteer for a local non profit— there are a TON of non profits around town that need board members, or consistent volunteers. a few ideas include 
   * Bellingham Food Recovery — sign up for shifts to transport food from local businesses to non profits or shelters (https://sustainableconnections.org/squatchfoodwaste/) 
   * Sign up to provide dinner, or host a skills class, for folks living at Gardenview Village (https://road2home.org/how-to-help/) 
   * Become a childcare volunteer at Lydia Place (https://lydiaplace.org/volunteer/) 
   * You can literally type into Google “volunteer opportunities whatcom county” and add in something that has to do with what you might want to do, and BAM, you will probably get a hit on a volunteer opp that is open in our community [https://**whatcomvolunteer.galaxydigital.com/need/index/24**](https://whatcomvolunteer.galaxydigital.com/need/index/24) **<— here is an index of close to all of the volunteer opps we have in the community.** 

Closing thoughts: Google is free, and so is the search bar at the top of this sub, you're more than welcome to ask ""how do I make community / friends"" and specify it to your situation / needs, **but if you can't even be bothered to do some cursory searches then it's unlikely you have the will / commitment to build community + friendships**.

It's tough out there, but we have such a cool community with really incredible people, doing incredible things, and the ""work"" involved in getting engaged, making friends, etc. is WELL worth it.",77,1739739186.0,Bellingham,15,0.94,False

Holy crap, this is not slime. This is green goo from hell. It SO wet, and SO sticky, it stuck to absolutely everything and just fell apart. My snot has a better texture than this crap. 

Maybe if I add the shimmer powder, it’ll absorb some of the moisture? Haha, no. What we have now created is this shiny monstrosity which turns everything it comes into contact with a shimmery, sticky mess. RIP my coffee table.

And that thought alone can be demotivating, I know, because I used to feel the same way. But it’s not true. Changes happen much faster than you think. Some changes you might not even notice because they happen slowly and gradually, but that doesn’t mean they’re not there.

The first thing you’ll notice, just a few hours after quitting, is that your heart rate and blood pressure return to normal. Cigarettes raise both, which is why it’s an illusion that they calm you down, they actually do the opposite.

The second thing you’ll notice just a few days after quitting is that your sense of smell and taste start recovering. I started drinking coffee when I began smoking, and when I quit and tried coffee again, I couldn’t even recognize the taste. It felt like I was drinking coffee for the first time. 

The third change is that you’ll feel like you have more energy than before. When we smoke, our body is constantly fighting against the toxins we’re putting in, which drains our energy. Once we stop, our body doesn’t need to fight anymore, and we start taking in more oxygen, helping our organs work properly. 

The fourth thing you’ll notice is that you’ll have more money for other things. Cigarettes have become a luxury item, they’re expensive, yet unnecessary. Without them, you’ll have extra money for things that actually matter. We pay someone to consciously poison us by inhaling tar, carbon monoxide, arsenic, and over 7,000 harmful substances, about 70 of which are carcinogenic.

Whatever your reason is for quitting, don’t wait. Don’t think it’ll be easier someday. If it was hard 5 years ago, if it’s hard now, why would it be easier 5 years from now? Enough with the excuses and lies, it’s time to quit for good.",32,1739738590.0,stopsmoking,2,0.98,False

\- It's a physical activity (ever tried contact improvisation?), it breaks some taboos and you can feel the chemistry right from the first moment.  
\- It's different from your usual coffee/walk/dinner date, and probably cheaper

Neither of us seemed in a hurry to move, and I liked that—that we weren’t rushing past this moment, that we were letting it unfold naturally.

He traced slow circles against my palm with his thumb, thoughtful. “I keep wondering if this should feel stranger than it does.”

I tilted my head, watching him. “And does it?”

He exhaled, shaking his head with a small smile. “No. It just feels… right.”

I knew exactly what he meant. It should have felt more uncertain, sitting here holding hands with a man who wasn’t my husband, stepping into something uncharted. But instead, it felt steady. Like we weren’t forcing anything—just allowing it to be.

A light breeze passed through the park, sending a few leaves skittering across the pavement. I shivered slightly, and he noticed immediately.

“Cold?”

“Just a little.”

Without hesitation, he shrugged off his jacket and draped it around my shoulders. It was warm, still carrying his scent, and the quiet intimacy of the gesture sent a soft hum through my chest.

“Better?” he asked, watching me.

I nodded. “Yeah.”

Neither of us made a move to stand, but the air between us shifted, a subtle pull drawing us closer. His hand tightened around mine, and I saw the flicker of hesitation in his expression—not uncertainty, just patience, waiting for me to decide how far this moment would go.

I made the choice for him.

Slowly, I leaned in, closing the small space between us. His breath caught, but he didn’t pull away. Instead, he met me halfway, his lips brushing against mine in a kiss that was soft, lingering, testing the edges of something we both already knew was real.

When we pulled back, he let out a quiet laugh, shaking his head. “Yeah. Definitely not strange.”

I smiled, curling deeper into his jacket. “Not even a little.”

He lifted our joined hands, pressing a kiss to my knuckles, his gaze steady on mine. “I don’t know where this leads,” he admitted.

“Me neither,” I said honestly. “But I know I want to find out.”

His fingers tightened around mine. “Then let’s find out together.”

And with that, we stood, stepping away from the bench and into whatever came next.

The walk back to the car felt different. Not because anything had changed drastically, but because something had settled. The unspoken questions, the careful hesitations—they weren’t gone, but they weren’t as heavy anymore.

He still held my hand, his thumb brushing over my knuckles in absent, thoughtful circles. I caught him glancing at me more than once, like he was memorizing the way I looked right now, wrapped in his jacket, still feeling the warmth of our first kiss.

When we reached the car, he opened the door for me, but before I could slide inside, he hesitated.

“I don’t want to take you home yet,” he admitted, voice low, almost like he was confessing something he wasn’t sure he should say.

I looked up at him, my fingers still curled around the edges of his jacket. “So don’t.”

His breath hitched just slightly, his hand tightening around the top of the car door. “Yeah?”

I nodded. “Yeah.”

He exhaled, then grinned—quick, a little breathless, as if I’d just given him permission for something he wasn’t ready to let go of yet.

“Alright,” he said, shutting my door gently before walking around to his side.

The car rumbled to life, and he didn’t even hesitate before pulling back onto the road, steering us away from home.



We ended up at a late-night coffee shop, the kind that stayed open for insomniacs and college students cramming for exams. It was quiet, just a few scattered people tucked into booths, some working on laptops, others lost in books.

He ordered for us, and I let him. It wasn’t that I didn’t have a preference—I just liked watching him take the lead in these small ways, seeing how he navigated this new space between us.

When he handed me my drink, our fingers brushed. That same flicker of warmth passed between us, the kind I was still getting used to but already wanted more of.

We found a table in the corner, the glow from a nearby lamp casting soft shadows across his face. He took a sip of his coffee, then rested his arms on the table, watching me.

“So,” he said, his voice quieter now, more serious. “How are you feeling about all this?”

I wrapped my hands around my cup, letting the warmth seep into my skin. “Honestly?”

“Always.”

I met his gaze. “It feels like something I’ve been waiting for without realizing it.”

His expression shifted, something unreadable flickering across it before settling into something softer. “Yeah,” he murmured. “Me too.”

We sat there for a long time, the coffee shop humming around us, the world outside still moving. But in here, in this little corner of the night, it felt like time had slowed just for us.

And I wasn’t in any rush to speed it up.

We lingered in the coffee shop longer than I expected, lost in conversation and small moments that felt more significant than they had any right to be. The tension, the uncertainty that had surrounded us earlier, had been replaced by something else—something quieter, more comfortable.

As we sat across from each other, I noticed how effortlessly the conversation flowed. It wasn’t about trying to make it perfect anymore. It was just us, in this space, seeing where it would take us. And for once, I didn’t feel the need to overthink it.

His eyes never strayed too far from mine, his attention steady, and in it, I found a sort of reassurance. Like, despite everything—despite the complexity of the situation—he was here, and that was enough.

“I never thought we’d end up here,” he said softly, swirling the last of his coffee in his cup. “Not that I’m complaining.”

I laughed, a little breathless. “No, me neither.”

He studied me for a long moment, and the air between us shifted again. It wasn’t charged, but it was… expectant. Like we were both waiting for something to happen, but neither of us was sure what it would be.

“Do you think this is too much?” he asked suddenly, his voice lower now, more thoughtful. “I mean, we’ve known each other for a while, but this—” He gestured between us, as if that simple motion could explain everything. “It’s new. And maybe it’s too soon.”

I smiled, leaning forward slightly. “I don’t think it’s too much. I think it’s just… different.”

“Different is good.”

“Yeah, it is.” I looked at him, really looked at him for the first time in a while. The way he seemed to be waiting for an answer, not rushing me, letting me decide what felt right. “We don’t have to rush it. We can let it be whatever it is.”

His eyes softened. “That sounds like exactly what I needed to hear.”

We stayed there for another hour, just talking and letting the night stretch on around us, letting the easy flow of our conversation carry us through the uncertainty.

When we finally left the coffee shop, it felt like we were walking into something—together, but not yet fully defined. And that was okay. We weren’t in a rush. There was no need to figure everything out tonight.

The drive back to my place was quiet, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. There was something between us now, something undeniable, and I didn’t have to say it for him to feel it.

He parked in front of my building, and when I reached for the door handle, he stopped me with a gentle touch on my wrist.

“Do you want to…?” His voice trailed off, and he didn’t finish the question, but I knew what he meant.

I turned to him, my pulse quickening slightly, but not from nervousness. Just from the weight of what felt like an unspoken invitation.

I didn’t need to think about it. “Yeah. I want to.”

And with that, we stepped into whatever this was, taking it one step at a time, with no pressure, no expectations—just a willingness to see where it went. Together.",1,1739738002.0,u_Darkness_WithIn6833,0,1.0,False

I would like to speak about a specific case and it is a public one. The people involved have made videos, we know their names and so on so I am not exposing anything that has not already been exposed.

There is a brother in the UK who is famous. I am not familiar with him but I know he is known in the world of dawah. His name is Hamza and his channel is HamzasDen.

Once, i came across a live stream on his channel so I joined and he was asking people to send him money so that he would concentrate on dawah. He was complaining that his work at his store prevented him to do what he enjoyed, which is dawah. 

I told him that The Prophet, may peace be upon Him, worked, as well as All The Prophets before Him=, may peace be upon Them All. and that no one's time was more precious than Their (AS) time. 

I told him that this is sunnah to work and he will also be rewarded for working for his family and this in itself, is a form of dawah. Not only preaching the Word, but living the Word.

Some people agreed with me on the chat and he seemed very disappointed, as if i came at the wrong time for him and Allah knows best. He said it is OK if you don't want to send me money, I will find this money anyway....

Now, I came across a video on his channel. I am not a subscriber but I saw the title and it said: ""£50k DEBT! Explain Yourself! - Responding to the Criticism""

He is reacting to another brother whom I do not know, who is saying that it is shameful for him to ask for Muslims to pay his debt when so many Muslims are suffering right now.

I left a message, telling him I am a married woman with a family and I did work 2 jobs 91 full-time and the other part-time)  for 4 years and a half, alhamdulillah and I have never been in debt. if one cannot afford a store or a way of living, one can sell it and go find a job or 2 and support his family. How is this the responsibility of Muslims?

This brother is based in the UK and since the covid, the local charities who normally work mainly outside of the UK, have had to create funds to help people in the UK because most Muslims are actually poor. With the covid, people like taxi drivers and so on could no longer afford to support their families. Now, some charities offer the possibility to pay your zakat to those people....so why does he get the priority?

Also, he reverted some time ago and I do not understand how he is not ashamed. i feel embarrassment for him. It makes me think of Mr and Mrs Muslim....do you remember them?

This is a couple in the US who said they had converted. They were not in the streets or anything like that but they managed to get more than $80K from Muslims!!!!! This upset me a lot because some Muslims send money to people just because they are white with blue eyes (don't deny it, you know this is the truth) and they leave Muslims in Black Africa and very poor areas of the world without any help. Some people have noticed it and are cashing in big time on it. How upsetting it is!!!! 

The guy called Grayson received  alot of money too. I kept telling Muslims, please send your money to Gaza but they would pay him a coffee via an app (it means they send him money) and now we can see he used his money to drink alcohol. We already knew he was taking drugs (cannabis I think) and still, people would rather send money to him than to their fellow brothers and sisters.

Wallahi, i will never forget one video i watched about an old man in Sudan. It was for a charity and he said he has 2 small kids, a boy and a girl They were very sick so he went running around asking for money so he could get medication but NO ONE helped him. When he came back home, one had died....Then,m he said, only then they helped him buy the white piece of clothing to bury the child!!!! How is this acceptable!!! is he not white enough? is he not cool enough? is he not a good prospect enough for those made-up hijabis? O Muslims, why did you leave your brother in such a situation while you are sending so much money to people who might or might not become Muslim? They work, they lack NOTHING. Why are you sending them money? Since when are we bribing people into embracing Islam????

I am warning you of cons and people whose nafs is becoming too strong to resist an opportunity to make a lot of money in a very little amount of time.

In that video on HamzasDen channel, that i am watching now, the ""Uncle Omar"" who is exposing him, mentioned a gofundme for £6K to pay for hotels during a trip that Hamza took in Qatar!!! £6K!!!!!! You can buy at least 7 water wells for that price with some charities! Hamza answered by saying it was an expensive time because it was during the World Cup....

People have no longer any shame. The Prophet, may peace be upon him, said we would be humiliated when Muslims become very numerous but are overwhelmed by wahn and He, may peace be upon Him, defined wahn by the love of this dunya and its materials and the hate of death. 

I do not need to hate zionists and non-Muslims. there is plenty to do in my own community....we are the ones allowing them to do all this harm to us. We are the weakest link.

I unfortunately am sandwiched between two apartments that are friends with one another, one across the hall and the other above me. Separately, they are both menaces in their own right, but the constant opening and loudly closing the doors, running up and down the stairs to each others apartments, is INSANE. It is 3:20pm on a Sunday, and since 3, the door has opened a slammed closed at least 10 times. Not an exaggeration, if they are both home, it is constant.

We already don’t like each other as they know I’ve complained to the landlord about them making noise in the halls late at night, after they ignored my first note to them. (By ignored, I mean that I could hear them cursing me off through my ceiling.) My landlord sat them down and talked to them, and it stopped happening at 4am on a Wednesday. But it still happens all. Day. Long. 

I am not some grumpy old neighbor who is mad about regular, expected living noises in a prewar NYC apartment building. I am frustrated that I can’t sit in my living room in front of the tv without my coffee table shaking from the constant slamming and running. It’s extremely inconsiderate, and I’m tired of them pretending they live in their own personal duplex apartment and not a six unit apartment building. I also don’t think it bothers other neighbors as much as they’re not directly in front of it (and the neighbor across the hall from the upstairs unit is rarely home so she probably doesn’t hear it as much.)

What can I do? I feel like my landlord won’t take this seriously because it’s during the day and he already knows I hate them. But I’m at my wits end. And my apartment is beautiful and cheap, moving is not an option. ",10,1739737702.0,neighborsfromhell,5,0.86,False
1ir1p7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ir1p7t/wibta_for_cutting_contact_with_my_mother_after/,WIBTA for cutting contact with my mother after she sent me a package?,"# TLDR: I have established a ""no gifts"" policy with my emotionally abusive mother. I have moved back in-state last month and have kept my address private. I believe she somehow found my address and sent me a ""gift"" to show she can cross my boundaries.

WIBTA to cut contact by instructing her to not contact me anymore and that she will be trespassed if she shows up, then blocking her on all accounts? I'd first send a thank you text to confirm it was her.

To put it simply, my mother is an emotionally manipulative narcissist. I can relate to everyone who has been yelled at for loading the dishwasher the wrong way. This is the woman who wanted me to go into management and said I could do better when my first job out of college was ""assistant manager.""

I'm out of my 20s now, but when I graduated college the first time and got all my stuff out of the house so she couldn't control me, she invited me back for coffee. She gifted me a scarf, hat and shirt and used it as blackmail to spend more time with her. That was the tipping point where I laid down some ground rules: 1 no gifts. 2 no drama. 3 no problem.

I have not gone completely cold on her, as that seemed to signal to me more that I needed to up my conflict management skills. I have established that, despite her best efforts to be a good mother, she could not give me what I needed. She surprised me by taking what I said seriously and trying to improve. But it was a red herring - she wanted short-term advice of what not to do, not to change who she is.

I proposed a year of therapy and, at the end of it, we have a group session. I insisted on a psychologist. First, she talked it down to 6 months. Then, she spent the next 6 months ""looking for a therapist"" and when I called her out, she had signed up with a counselor. Needless to say, I was done with my portion well in advance, but I was going for me, not her.

Having not done the work, she calls me every month or two with some sort of Trojan horse that I have to respond to and then eventually works her way into emotionally assaulting me for hurting her by limiting contact. I have been resilient to her BS. Her last call was ""we can't have a relationship if we don't communicate, so let's talk every week about anything at all."" No.

Needless to say, I have not been updating her on my major life events, including graduating again, getting divorced, and moving back in-state. The rest of my family knows I do not want my info coming back to her, but I have cousins, who have mothers, who are her sisters.

Recently, the cops knocked on my door at 2 am to inform me I had left my parking lights on. Odd, but thanks. I looked down and saw a small package from Amazon that I didn't order. I moved to my current residence a month ago. Three relatives have my address: my father, my brother, and my aunt. I took it inside and opened it.

Inside was a gift receipt and two items. Item 1 was a tumbler related to my profession that my dad (who is divorced from my mom and remarried) had also sent me on my birthday, several months earlier. The other was one of those morph cubes, a puzzle similar to things Mom loved to buy for our ""stimulation"" when we were kids (I found Nintendo more entertaining). I tried contacting Amazon, but they will not spill.

My brother suggested I just go cold like he did. She has a history of inviting herself to his house, which is states away, and playing nurse to his pregnant wife who did not want her intervention. His last straw was when he called her to share the birth of his second child and she made him feel like garbage for the child's middle name being after the above aunt (who has good boundaries) that Mom hates. Side note: there is a family photo on my aunt's fridge and the magnet is over my mom's face.

I feel like I've put in the effort. And, while I am thankful that I got to do youth programs and that she did try, it is not worth being subjected to her nastiness anymore. To me, this ""gift"" says ""I know how to find you and I'll continue crapping on your boundaries every chance I get.""",8,1739737680.0,AITAH,3,0.91,False

I got a job which provided housing for me, in this house (it's like a hotel/house) there's only me and a girl.

At the start I was distant not interacting at all with her, because I'm naturally scared and uncomfortable with people, but one day I had to go to work with her cause of training, she would tease me and get me to talk, and almost when the shift was done we had a staring contest, and she said whoever lost had to do the other's wish, I lost, and when we got home I set down with her at our shared kitchen, she dared me to not be shy towards her and we talked, I also played decks dark and she seemed to like it, she made us both coffee, and afterwards said that we should go to her room, so I anxiously followed we set on her bed, she put on a movie and after it was done she said that we should listen to music.

Then she got a joint out and smoked and I told her that after she's done with that I'm going to play the most beautiful song, so after she smoked it all I told her to close her eyes and I played nude, and she fell asleep, next day I asked how it was and she said notions like the song took her to a different place and she said that it was really good.

I just wanted to share this experience sorry for writing so much (p.s. she got me to smoke pot with her, which is perfect cause radiohead songs already made me feel high on their own)",19,1739737623.0,radiohead,25,0.67,False
1ir1o4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1ir1o4d/should_i_have_done_something_different/,Should I have done something different?,"I was doing work in a coffee shop directly under an L station. I was sitting next to a window and a homeless man pressed up against the window and started trying to get my attention. I ended up waving to him, hoping he’d leave me alone. 

He ends up coming into the shop and asks me to buy him a coffee. The coffee shop was crowded and I was sitting by myself, but I thought if I bought him one, he’d leave me alone. I go up to get him one and once he gets it, he grabs my hand and kisses my hand. I try to pull away but he grabs even tighter and keeps on kissing it.

I’m thoroughly grossed out at this point but he finally leaves. 10 minutes later, he comes back in asking me for another coffee and won’t leave me alone. I say I’m busy and need to focus on my work, so he walks away but stands at the entrance and stares at me for a good 5 minutes, shaking and talking to himself. He eventually leaves, comes back about 5 minutes later, and comes up to me again. FINALLY, an employee tells him he can’t stay here and gets him to leave. I was spooked for the rest of the time but also was afraid to leave, because I knew he was sitting out in the alley next to the entrance. 

Again, the shop was super crowded, many people saw this happening, and no one intervened until he was back on his 3rd visit. What should I have done differently?

So I guess I'm venting for advice..?

I've been on the dating pool for a while now^(forever) and I'm currently more active on ""real life"" than dating apps, and seems like everyone I meet is as title says.  
That might be also a perfect application [of the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion) (noticing a specific concept more frequently after recently becoming aware of it), but it still feels strange.

Some examples:

I briefly met someone a while ago, we chatted, set a date for dancing together, went, turns out after they have a partner.

I saw some stories on IG of a person I follow, complaining about social interacting in the city where I live, so I decided to invite this person out for a coffee because it's a topic I care about.  
Bear in mind, I didn't wanted to ""date"" as in ""romantic meeting"", but ""date"" as in ""wanna talk about this thing for real"", because apparently we were on the same page about poor digital connections and some sort of lack of social skills.  
I'm still waiting for a confirmation on the eventual date (which is a bit odd, not gonna lie), but before agreeing on the coffee, they mention their partner.

I've started to do contemporary theatre and dancing some months ago.  
Almost all the people in my group are either in a long-term relationship, or got into one shortly after we started.  
During one of the theatre trainings I met someone who gave me an unexpected compliments.  
They gave me their phone number shortly after, and managed to briefly meet in person.  
During our short chat I found an interesting connection, which sparkled my curiosity for a future date.  
Again, not necessarily romantic related, it was regarding performing and acting.  
Almost never heard from them again, other than inviting me to a group party and not showing up.

I could go on but you get the idea.  
What shall I take from this? Are all decent people already in a happy relationship?  
Am I invisible, unattractive or just uninteresting for the few left? What to do?

I never recovered from the mono fully. I still have had severe lymph node pain, and fatigue. I got my thyroid checked and my numbers were good. But now,I'm getting very weird health problems that I never had before, specifically severe allergic reactions. I never had an allergic reaction like how I am getting them now! They're food and medicine related, I will say to what and why I think that it's histimine intolerance.

All within the last 30 days, I started getting somewhat severe allergic reactions occasionally to things that I was never allergic to. Then, the reactions took a turn from bad to worse. I was recently sick with the flu and had a suspected kidney infection (which is very serious) and was put on a number of different medicines. I started getting a very bad allergic reaction while in the hospital, and literally had like five nurses in the room to make sure the reaction didn't escalate any further. After my time in the hospital and on antibiotics, it feels like I can't eat anything! Before I had a list of things that bothered me, which was: 

soy, nuts and seeds, chocolate, spinach, stevia,honey, matcha, and coffee. 

Now the list seems to have grown so much I am afraid to eat anything different. 
Ive had an allergic reaction nearly everyday to something, and had to keep taking Benadryl. Now I am taking Zyrtec, just to have a ""normal"" day. 

The reason I'm suspicious this is a histamine intolerance is because all of the foods I originally listed are all high histamine foods. So are a lot of the other foods I've had reactions to that I didn't list. So naturally I had to stop eating these foods because I did not want to get another reaction like how I have been. That has helped me significantly, but not totally. So, I was looking into an anti inflammatory diet before being suspicious of a histamine issue. 
Some of the things like cutting out dairy and gluten to lower inflammation were part of the diet, and so I did that. I think this helped me because I noticed some foods were more tolerable then than they are now, totally by accident. (I eat lots of sourdough bread) and yogurt. Now that I have them back in my diet, my reactions to foods seems to be worse. I also notice that my probiotic gives me a reaction as well.

Now I plan on trying the low histamine diet to see if it helps, I really hope it does because it is so rigerous, but it feels like I have no other choice to have a normal life again.

Also, I've had so many other weird symptoms on top of all of this: 

Poor circulation 
Weight gain (suspected from antihistamine use) 
When having allergic reactions I get severe pain in my thyroid 
Acne which I didn't have before( started to come back during mono, has gotten worse and looks different than any acne I've had before. Back acne on the shoulders which is new) 
Very swollen looking, specifically my eyelids.
Some urine retention. Ringing ears occasionally. Being super sensitive emotionally.

1ir1ja6,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1ir1ja6/delonghi_eletta_explore_review/,Delonghi Eletta Explore Review,"Background:

I have been making 1 - 2 drinks on an espresso machine (Breville Dual Boiler) with a nice grinder and I use a decent workflow for a number of years. However, I have less time in the morning and have no time to manually make a latte. 

The TLDR:

- All of my complaints about this machine are minor and insignificant for a super automatic
- I love this machine, it saves me a significant amount of time and the quality of the coffee has exceeded my expectations

The Bad:

- The Low setting on the steamed milk is not hot enough for my liking
- I had to adjust my expectations of steamed milk/micro-foam due to coming from being use to manually steaming milk and the super automatic just being unable to steam milk to the same quality
- The milk carafe is a bit odd because the top mechanism just sits on top of the container. It doesn’t really snap or lock in so I feel that at some point I’ll accidentally grab the top and the container of milk will fall/spill
- Delonghi also doesn’t recommend washing the carafe with soap. Only dish washer or rinse with water which is odd 
- The app is terrible. It took me a long time to get it to sync with my machine and even now every time I load up the app I have a 50/50 chance of it connecting to the machine. It also will prompt me to add a machine as if I’m using the app for the first time (this might just be some registration error and I need to delete and re-add my machine). 
- The machine performs a purge on start up and shut down which defeats the purpose of having an app that’s capable of remotely brewing a cup of coffee
- Cleaning up the spent coffee container is annoying since there is so much humidity inside that a lot of the grinds sticks to the container making it more challenging to clean
- The drip tray doesn’t really have a spout area so pouring the drip tray out can be a bit of a mess and requires me to wipe down the sides of the tray since the water goes everywhere

The Good:

- I am use to being patient dialing in beans and dialing in a great cup with this machine was easier than I thought it would be
- Once properly dialed in the shots are really good. I am legitimately impressed
- I wish I had more control over the temp of the coffee but the hot setting works well to get the right extraction
- mid to high foam drinks are really good and considering it only takes a few minutes for everything, I’m really impressed
- I really appreciate the self purge feature of the milk carafe since it makes it super easy to detach it and put it in the fridge when I’m done and not worry about extra clean up

* **Reception Room** (3.96m x 3.85m)
* **Kitchen/Dining Room** (6.51m x 3.64m)
* **Bedroom** (3.95m x 3.28m)

* **Bedroom:** Considering adding a 90cm study desk.
* **Storage:** Inbuilt storage along the kitchen walls and an inbuilt wardrobe beside the toilet.

A few things I’d love feedback on:

1. **Best Placement for My Study Desk** – I need a functional workspace without making the bedroom feel cramped. However, my partner and I require separate areas to hold our calls during work from home days, seems like one of us will have to have a desk in the room.
2. **Optimizing the Living Area** – Does my current furniture arrangement make sense, or should I reposition items for better flow? I feel like there is so much space in the dining area that I do not know how to optimise?

When I tried matcha from my local Japanese dollar store (daiso) it didn’t taste like what I expected—A bit too bitter and slightly grassy on the palate. It was also more brown/yellow than vibrant green. The influencers typically recommend a more expensive ceremonial grade matcha but I’m slightly confused what to look for as they never specify which type of ceremony their brand is most appropriate for. In fact, I don’t even want to drink my matcha at a particular ceremony I’m just looking for one that I can drink casually at home, a “daily drinker” if you will. Costco in my city sells itoen matcha sencha teabags which I’ve tried but when I open the sachet and use my frother in a bowl to brew traditional style the powder never seems to dissolve correctly or get foamy. Even with freshly boiled water. So I guess my question is do you have any recommendations for matcha brands that would suit my purpose and budget? Is there a big difference between the American brands or the Japanese brands that seem to sell out more quickly? I’m also considering starting my own organic matcha business to capitalize on the current hype so if you have any advice on how I could eventually grow and grind my own tea on the weekends that would be cool too.

1ir1exq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Darkness_WithIn6833/comments/1ir1exq/the_first_step/,The First Step,"I stood in front of the mirror, tugging at the hem of my shirt for the tenth time. It was casual—jeans, a soft sweater, sneakers—but somehow, it still felt like a big deal. My heart thumped a little harder than it should have.

Behind me, familiar footsteps entered the room. I didn’t need to turn around to know it was him—my husband. His presence was grounding, steady, exactly what I needed.

“Nervous?” he asked, voice laced with quiet amusement.

I let out a breath, finally looking at him. “A little.”

He leaned against the doorway, arms crossed, studying me with that patient expression of his. “You don’t have to be.”

I knew that. We had talked about this for weeks. Months. But knowing and feeling weren’t the same thing.

He stepped closer, hands resting at my waist. “You look good,” he said, pressing a soft kiss to my temple. “And you’re going to have a good time.”

I exhaled, some of the tension leaving my shoulders. “Yeah. I think I will.”

A knock at the front door made my stomach flip. It was time.

With one last glance at my husband, I grabbed my jacket and went to meet the man waiting for me.

I opened the door, and there he was—smiling, hands tucked into the pockets of his jacket like he was trying to play it cool. But I saw the way his eyes flicked over me, quick and searching, like he was checking to see if I was just as nervous as he was.

“Hey,” he said, shifting on his feet.

“Hey.” I smiled, stepping outside and pulling the door shut behind me. The cool evening air met my skin, a welcome contrast to the warmth still lingering in my chest.

We walked to his car, the silence not exactly awkward, but not quite settled either. The newness of it all buzzed between us. We’d spent time together before, of course—long conversations, shared glances, easy laughter—but this was different. This was a first date. And first dates had a weight to them, even when they were with someone you already knew.

He opened the car door for me, and I bit back a smile as I slid inside. He was trying. I liked that.

As he got in on his side, he let out a breath and glanced at me. “So… dinner first, then maybe a walk? Unless you have a better idea?”

“That sounds good,” I said. “Something simple.”

He nodded, tapping his fingers against the steering wheel before pulling out of the driveway. “Simple works for me.”

I stole a glance at him, taking in the slight tension in his jaw, the way he kept sneaking looks at me like he was still making sure this was real. It was strange, this in-between space—being married to one man and sitting beside another who was trying to figure out how to take me on a date. But it wasn’t wrong. It wasn’t uncertain. It was just new.

And as the car rolled onto the open road, I let myself sink into that feeling, into the anticipation of something just beginning.

For the first few minutes, the drive was quiet, filled only with the soft hum of the radio. It wasn’t uncomfortable—just new. Different. He tapped his fingers on the steering wheel, a steady rhythm, like he was working through thoughts he hadn’t put into words yet. I could feel them in the air between us, but I didn’t push. I had my own thoughts to sort through.

Finally, he let out a breath and glanced at me. “This feels kinda weird, doesn’t it?”

I huffed out a laugh. “A little.”

“I mean, we talk all the time. I’ve seen you first thing in the morning, hair a mess, coffee in hand, completely ignoring the world. But this…” He gestured vaguely between us. “This is new.”

“Yeah,” I admitted, folding my hands in my lap. “It is.”

He tapped the wheel again, then gave me a sideways smile. “I almost called you earlier. Thought about saying, ‘Hey, let’s just hang out like usual,’ but then I figured that would be cheating.”

“Cheating?” I raised a brow.

He shrugged. “I want to do this right.”

That made something in my chest go warm. He wasn’t just coasting into this, wasn’t assuming that because we already knew each other, the details didn’t matter. He wanted to be intentional about it. And that mattered.

I let my fingers trail along the seam of my jeans, exhaling softly. “There’s not exactly a rulebook for this, you know.”

“I know,” he said, thoughtful. “Guess we’ll figure it out.”

“Yeah,” I agreed. “I guess we will.”

The conversation shifted after that, easing into something more familiar. He told me a ridiculous story from his day, something about a coworker’s failed attempt at fixing the office printer, and by the time we pulled into the restaurant parking lot, I was laughing.

The nerves were still there, humming beneath the surface. But as he put the car in park and looked over at me, smiling like he was just as ready for this as I was, I decided to let myself enjoy it.

1ir1dnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1ir1dnh/husband_doesnt_like_celebrating_valentines_day_or/,Husband doesn't like celebrating valentines day or other holidays,"I want to get something off my chest and see other inputs because 1 issue leads to many others .

For starters this was my first valentines day being married (3 year relationship) and I feel so disappointed that my husband didn't get me anything 😔 despite me telling him how gifts are my love language and I guess he hasn't gotten the memo after several upsetting moments. To be clear, I do not expect expensive gifts (although would be nice lol) but it can be anything candy, flowers, a single rose, my fav dessert coffee, chips etc. I just like to be acknowledged by the gesture that someone thought about me.

I asked him the day of where was my gift and he said he didn't get a chance to go to the store and I snapped. I may have said things that came off hurtful like I deserve more or I want to be with someone that celebrates special days even if it's a stupid holiday. I also said I feel stuck in the relationship bc we started an immigration process that who knows how long itll take given current situations in the world and I know that probably hurt but its true. Not like I can get up and move on, we're not only married but also in this process that has not been cheap to say the least. 

Money has been an issue since the getgo and Im honest to say I didn't think it through fully b4 tying the knot and now reality has hit me when it comes to paying bills, emergency expenses etc. He's basically paycheck to paycheck and I'm the breadwinner. We don't join accounts bc I feel some type of way but he helps with a percentage of money on a monthly basis, helps around the house, cooks cleans, helps with the kids etc is a good man overall doesn't disrespect me and is pretty much a healthy relationship. 

As he says valentines day should be every day and I agree but also why not celebrate it the day of? I feel I been so understanding with his financial situation and him not getting me anything for my Birthdays, Christmas, mother's day has hurt so much and idk how long i can take this. Despite him not getting me anything I have gotten him gifts but it sucks things not being reciprocal. I feel like i show up more in this relationship and mostly financially so I'm hurt that I can't even get something from the dollar store to make me feel special..

Thinking about it deeper, it hurts more bc this is how my dad was with my mom. Hes never celebrated her in any occasion in 30 something years they been married and growing up it just hurt me and I always said that wouldn't be me and now it is and has me feeling let down. 

We haven't really spoken since Friday and I tried talking this morning but he said I said enough and he didn't feel like talking so I left it alone. For the record i despise silent treatment so this not talking stage is really making me anxious. Not sure how to approach this but I'm very saddened and I feel like our marriage is over.

1ir1cuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HSVpositive/comments/1ir1cuh/constant_outbreaks/,Constant outbreaks,"Contracted GHSV2 6 weeks ago. I’m having my 5th outbreak. I’m exhausted because I’ve had the lesions more days than I haven’t. I don’t know if this is all just one big outbreak or 5 individual once’s. There’s usually a couple days of relief with no lesions between each outbreak. But then the lesions pop right back up again. I always have tingling and nerve pain constantly whether the lesions are there or not. I feel constant discomfort and pain. So I’m wondering if this is all considered as part of my first initial outbreak? Or 5 separate outbreaks? I take 1 gram of l-lysine daily and 400mg of acyclovir daily as suppressive therapy. I’ve cut out my favourite foods that supposedly trigger an outbreak like chocolate, oats, nuts, coffee. I exercise 4 times a week and try to eat a clean balanced diet. Advice welcomed please. Are these constant prolonged symptoms normal? When can I expect this to calm down? I could accept my diagnosis more if the lesions healed and I only get an outbreak couple times a year. But the non stop outbreaks is tiring and makes me feel hopeless. I can’t date at all now if I don’t even understand what is going on with my body. At least if the outbreaks were infrequent and the medication helped I could get back out there and date again. But now I really can’t because the outbreaks are nonstop.

High school was a whirlwind and I never was given the opportunity for a theatre/ acting class as my school hadn’t offered it. Thats not to say I have no experience in acting, I’ve found that over the years I highly enjoy books, films, poems, art, music and so on and so forth where I can connect to a character, to which I’ll practice embodying. Furthermore, I know this seems odd, but as someone who was not able to afford, nor was allowed, acting lessons I would express myself by adopting a certain character or personality for a day and go out and about (a coffee shop, mall, etc) and socialize as that character, just to get a taste for what acting might entail. And trust me, I know it’s sort of odd, but genuinely such a fun thing to do. Aside from this I’ve only ever really done self tapes or practiced in front of a mirror, never with others in the room, so ive never received feedback. 

I know it’s every child’s dream to become an actor, and I know it’s unlikely I would get far without having done this from a young age, but I harbour so much passion for this that I owe it to myself to at least try. I am 18 years old and I want to know if I have any chance in the film industry, especially with no prior training. I’ve heard people often begin on student/small films to get a start point, but I don’t even know where to begin with all of this.

I don’t mind driving her, but there are days when I simply can’t. Today, for example, it’s been snowing heavily, and I still had to take her to class. I just wanted to have a slow day, relax, and do nothing at home—but it turned into a fight.

We share household responsibilities, but somehow, I end up handling most outdoor chores. If she wants coffee, needs to buy plants, or has any activity related to her, I’m the designated driver. And if I don’t seem enthusiastic about it, she complains that I came unwillingly.

I go to the office twice a week, and on the other three days, I drive her to work. I don’t mind it, but sometimes I get busy. Last week, I had a lot of work and couldn’t take her, and that led to an argument.

She tried taking driving lessons but never attempted the test. I encouraged her, but she insists she needs more practice. I even volunteered to teach her, but she doesn’t like my teaching style.

1ir19eg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1ir19eg/getting_over_somebody_i_never_dated/,Getting over somebody I never dated,"Hi! I (26 y.o. male) have been feeling a lot of emotions since I started working at my current job. I'm a virgin and I grew up being morbidly obese until covid hit and I ended up on a hospital bed with the doctor telling me if I don't consider making some major changes then my life would be in danger. After that, I started eating less and healthier food, working out and across 4 years I managed to lose 50kgs (110lbs) from 160kgs (352lbs). 

Throughout the years, I've had some crushes but never really considered going past that point. I wouldn't give myself the chance because I kept thinking that ""I'm not good enough"" or ""why would she ever give a guy like me a chance"". So I decided to work on my anxiety and lack of confidence by going out with friends more and trying to be more sociable.

Last year I met this 24 y.o. girl  at work. Whenever she came to me with a work related problem, I'd gladly help her. We kept having friendly interactions each day, found out we have quite a lot in common regarding our taste in music, anime, sense of humor, etc... Before I even realized, I started developing a crush on her. This time though, I decided to give myself a chance for the first time. So I tried being a little flirty (even though i had no idea what being flirty meant) by giving her a friendly smile each time our eyes met, asking how her day was, asking if she'd like to go on lunch breaks together, etc... At this point I believed she was aware of my feelings towards her and from how I interpreted the signals she was giving me made me think the feeling was mutual... I'd also catch some mixed signals from her but kept thinking ""she must be shy"" or ""she's having a bad day"". Nonetheless I gathered up all my courage and asked her out for a coffee while also making sure to tell her how I felt. She told me she appreciates it but she's quite busy and doesn't really like getting coffee but she would think about it. I didn't want to seem impatient or desperate so for the 2 weeks that followed, I didn't even bring it up. It felt like torture because my feelings kept developing and I couldn't get her out of my head. I didn't want to creep her out or push her away so I forced myself to be patient and waited for her answer. That answer never came.

2 weeks later, I asked her if we could talk. In short, I kinda confessed to her again but this time she straight up told me that she wasn't looking for a relationship and she'd like us to be just friends. This hurt but I felt like I could handle those feelings and just let them fade away as I've been doing my whole life.

Things  were pretty normal between us. It didn't feel awkward. We stopped interacting as much until I decided to send her a random text saying ""Hey! That song you showed me the other day... I just can't get it out of my head!"". That night we ended up texting for about 4-5 hours. After that, our conversations became deeper and more regular. She would act even more friendly around me. At one point she came to me one morning and told me that she had a dream with me. I REMEMBER WORD BY WORD how she described it. In short, we were alone in a haunted house chased by a killer and she told me to protect her and hugged my arm. That gave me a huge boost in confidence and made me believe that she might have changed her mind  because I thought she saw me as somebody she can count on and trust.

So I allowed myself to feel love. It was wonderful. A feeling so warm I never experienced. I was sure that if I'd talk to her again, this time she would accept my feelings. So I asked her if we could talk and I got shut down....again.. Only this time, it hurt 100 times worse because this dream land inside my head came crumbling down. All the love that I had felt turned into a very deep void of despair. To make things even worse, this time things were very awkward between us. I sent her a text apologizing that I had misinterpreted the situation. We agreed to keep some distance between us for a while. The following 2 months I felt like an empty, emotionless blob just existing. Each time I'd see her at work, I'd feel the void inside me grow larger.

It's been 4 months. I'm feeling better now. We started talking again. The thing is, I would like to keep being friends with her because we have so much in common and she's a very cool person but many of my other friends told me I should change jobs and go no-contact because I'd only end up hurting myself again. To me, it just doesn't feel right to do that. I'm making an effort to fight off those feelings of emptiness and despair but I'm scared if I continue like this I might end up ruining myself more. There are days when my feelings for her resurface and I have to take a break to recognize them and let myself feel like shit for a couple days and then continue with my life..

My question is: Can I move on while also maintaining a genuine friendship with this person?
