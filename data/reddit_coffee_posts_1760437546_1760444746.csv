This paired with early onset male pattern balding and just generally feeling terrible about myself (OCD, short, skinny, overall not very cool and pretty dumb) led me to becoming a recluse. 

Whilst some were true. It wasn’t really the reason people didn’t want to be my friend. They didn’t want to be my friend, because I had a crap personality and was in so much pain I hated everyone, the world, God and mostly myself. I wanted to die. 

Now, I’ve had sex. Had girlfriends, currently have a girlfriend who loves me. But my pain and anguish and depression have led me down a deep and dark path. 

Currently I spiral each time I learn something about my partners past. I struggle to know some of the sex stuff shes done. Maybe I’m jealous or it’s my prejudices. 

Shes lied a few times which led me to a horribly awkward moment where I was having coffee with a mutual friend, only to realise he knows my girlfriend intimately when she said they didn’t. She says she lied to protect me, but I just feel worse. 

Feel like she was keeping me safe from him because he’s so much better than me. 

I don’t want this relationship anymore, because I just want to love myself. 

Everything feels fucked.

Description: # Head of Marketing Analytics & Measurement, AU
_Healthcare is usually slow and boring. We believe in its potential to be exciting and entertaining. But changing the healthcare experience is hard – and we’re gonna need all the help we can get…!_
**About Eucalyptus**
**Eucalyptus**(or 'Euc' for short) is an Australian founded digital healthcare company that is on a mission to solve the world’s biggest healthcare challenges - think fertility, and behavioral change around chronic conditions such as weight loss, diabetes, and mental health.
Founded in Australia in 2019, we have now helped over 500K patients globally by combining technology, design and operational excellence to help patients access the best clinical support when they need it - wherever they are.
Our 4 brands (Juniper, Pilot, Kin & Software) focus heavily on personalizing the experience for different demographics and are powered by a growing team across 5 countries (Australia, UK, Germany, Japan, and the Philippines).
We’ve raised over AUD$150M in funding from Aussie and Silicon Valley investors who were early backers of Uber, Canva and AirBnb. With plans to launch into several more markets, offline channels, and tackle new conditions.
We’re looking to continue building our team of executional weapons who are passionate about healthcare, aren’t afraid to work hard, and invest in others through direct and honest feedback. This approach enables us to make the most impactful changes to improve the health of millions of patients globally.
**About the role (What You’ll be Doing)**
We’re hiring a **Head of Marketing Analytics & Measurement** to lead how we track, analyse, and improve our marketing performance across all brands and markets.
This is a senior, hands-on IC role for someone who blends **marketing intuition** with **analytical precision** — a measurement architect who understands how performance media really works, and how to make it work better.
Your job is to give our global marketing teams the clarity and confidence to spend better.
You’ll design and own our global measurement framework — from attribution and incrementality to MMM, test design, and dashboarding — so we can spend smarter, reduce waste, and improve contribution margin across markets.
This means:
  * Setting the global measurement strategy for paid, owned, and earned channels
  * Building and enforcing attribution standards across AU/UK/DE/JP
  * Overseeing our tooling stack — GA4, GTM, Looker, BigQuery, Paramark, MMM, Metabase
  * Owning relationships with analytics partners (e.g. Paramark, geo-testing vendors)
  * Collaborating closely with performance and conversion marketers to embed best-practice testing and measurement
  * Writing and maintaining playbooks — so we learn and improve systematically
  * Supporting strong signal health (CAPI, UTM, server-side tracking, etc.) in partnership with our Head of Analytics and engineers
  * Building and maintaining dashboards (or guiding those who do) to give execs and marketers visibility into what matters
  * Advising on media planning and channel allocation with data-driven recommendations
  * Providing thought leadership on incrementality, lag effects, cohort analysis, and contribution-based metrics


You’ll work as part of the **Global Performance team** , reporting to the **Global Head of Performance** , and collaborating with performance leads, creative strategists, local growth teams, and data/engineering partners.
This is not a role for someone who just pulls reports. This is for someone who can build the measurement infrastructure that drives smarter decisions — and make our marketing meaningfully better.
**About you (Who you are)**
You’re an analytical leader who knows marketing — and a marketing leader who knows analytics.
You understand how spend turns into results, and how to design systems that uncover what’s truly incremental. You’re comfortable working across teams, across markets, and across messy data sets — and you bring the rigour, curiosity, and communication skills to make complexity actionable.
You’ll likely bring:
  * 8–12+ years in marketing analytics, measurement, or data strategy roles
  * Fluency in SQL and experience building dashboards (Looker, GA4, Metabase, or similar)
  * Experience setting up or managing MMM models (e.g. Paramark, Google Meridian, in-house regression)
  * Knowledge of geo-testing, holdouts, brand lift, and other incrementality tools
  * Strong understanding of attribution frameworks — including their limits and tradeoffs
  * Experience partnering with performance teams to improve CAC, LTV, and conversion
  * Confidence building and communicating data models to non-technical teams
  * Experience owning analytics tools and implementation (GTM, GA4, CAPI, etc.)
  * Bonus: Experience in DTC, health, or regulated categories
  * Bonus: Experience with cross-market orgs (EU/UK/AU/JP) or complex media budgets


**How we think about marketing**
At Euc, marketing is about capturing attention and turning it into real growth. We’re not here to chase perfect CTRs or vanity metrics. We’re here to grow the business — by finding where our audience is, grabbing their attention, and telling stories that drive action.
We move fast. Really fast. Because when ideas ship quicker, we learn quicker. We make bolder bets. And we don’t waste months on “safe” campaigns that never move the needle.
  * Creative wins. We don’t have exclusive access to channels, so great storytelling is how we stand out and earn attention.
  * Speed matters. Fast tests beat perfect plans. We ship early, learn fast, and move on.
  * Ad buying is problem solving. Whether it’s fixing a leaky funnel or finding the next unlock — curiosity is our superpower.
  * Fit matters. A good idea needs to match the channel. We tailor stories to the format, and we’re ruthless about what we let run.
  * Data is a compass. We ask why, not just what. Trends > daily swings. Insight + action = impact.
  * We focus on outcomes, not channels. If Meta works, we scale it. If TV works, we shift spend. No channel loyalty. Just growth.


If you’re excited by the challenge of turning 1 AUD into 5 AUD — and doing it across 5 brands, 4 countries, and millions of customers — this is the place.
**Why you should join Euc**
  * **Our teams are incredibly passionate** - Our talent bar is high and our work ethic is strong. You’ll get to stretch yourself everyday and work amongst people who care deeply about our patients. You’ll be given autonomy to tackle interesting problems and receive regular feedback from a supportive team.
  * **We move at incredible speed** - You’ll work with team mates who build in the open by sharing their work freely, this helps us learn and iterate quickly so we can deliver high quality outcomes faster than our competitors. You’ll spend a lot of time outside of your comfort zone learning and iterating frequently, we wouldn’t have it any other way.
  * **We will invest in your career** - You’ll get access to an annual professional development budget, mentors and buddies to ensure that you have the support you need to level up. You can expect regular performance and pay reviews as your career grows.
  * **We are all owners** - You’ll be given equity to ensure that you are able to benefit in the upside of your contribution in helping Euc grow. Your ideas will be valued regardless of your role, you will have ownership over the projects you work on which will feel both terrifying but extremely fulfilling.
  * **We play as hard as we work** - From our annual Eucalympics (Olympic themed decathlon), monthly health & fitness allowances, free weekly barista coffees, funded social clubs, quarterly rooftop parties and weekly catered fireside chats, we know how to let our hair down!
  * **We’ll have your back when you need us the most** - You’ll be able to lean on a range of leave offerings to support you when needed, this includes: personal health and professional development leave, a generous parental leave that offers 20 weeks paid leave for a primary carer, additional miscarriage leave (see more on Kin Fertility’s #WeNeedMoreLeave campaign), as well as our Employee Assistance Programe.

1o6e0ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1o6e0ue/passed_the_phr_on_a_throwaway_first_attemptmy/,"🤯 Passed the PHR on a ""Throwaway"" First Attempt—My Experience + Tips [N/A]","So I mostly felt that my test experience was like Kevin Malone and him eating broccoli for the first time. He knows it's gonna be a crappy experience but he's gotta do it. But he makes the experience even harder for himself by eating the stem first, ""this is a new food for me."" Lol, what an idiot. But this idiot isn't alone, he's got friends. Me. My ""stem first"" version was not studying for 5 months b4 the test. Not something that is generally recommended. Add-in halfway through the test my bladder was about to burst b/c I drank too much liquids the am of the test (FYI, you can't take bathroom breaks. At least for virtual exams) and I also had to drop a loaf. So I busted out of my office after the test to go to the bathroom. In the middle of it I get an email about something to do with a PHR badge. I was like, WTH?! and saw my results were available. It was like a starting gun went off and I was racing for the triple crown. I think I made it back to my desk b4 I fully buttoned my pants. While I waited for the site to load I thought through again what results I expected, about \~50% score, but I did have a new found hope. Somehow, I read ""PASS"". Unreal. 

Anyways, I figured I'd share my strange experience and some takeaways to hopefully give others a little extra hope and perspective, especially those who don't have a traditional HR background and/or procrastinate.

**My Non-Traditional Background**

* Experience: 10+ years exclusively in recruiting (agency and big tech).
* HR Knowledge: Limited to zero general HR experience outside of the laws and regulations related to hiring and recruiting.
* Education: BA in Accounting 
* Test-Taking Style: I believe I have fairly effective test-taking skills. I’m not generally an over-thinker on test answers (I.e. I only flagged 2 out of 115 questions for review).

**The Study & ""Throwaway"" Plan**

I applied for the test when they ran a deal for a free ""2nd Chance"" insurance—best decision ever (If you can, absolutely wait for these promos. I got mine in the Spring, they might do a fall one, too). My application was nearing its 6-month expiration, and since I had the safety net, my plan was simple: take the test, fail it, use the 3-month cool-off period to *actually* study, and take the second attempt seriously.

My Study plan (May 2025): I studied for about 1 month, 1–2 hours a day. Then, life got in the way and I stopped. Besides what I listed below, I believe I took one practice test on pocket prep (scored somewhere around 70-80%) and also one with PHR for Dummies (think I scored between 50-60%).

||
||
|Resource|Usage (Approx.)|Notes|
|Pocket Prep Premium|75% of my time|Completed 836 questions; 755 correct / 81 wrong.|
|PHR for Dummies|15-20% of my time|Good for core concepts.|
|Quizlet|5-10% of my time|Quick review of terms.|

Five months later—with zero recent studying—I sat for the exam and, somehow, passed.

**Key Takeaways: Prep Material vs. The Actual Test**

The most important difference I noticed was that the actual test questions felt easier than the questions in my study materials. The exam was more high-level and situational.

* Study Materials: Some of my studying focused on rote memorization like *“The FLS Act (FLSA) of 1938 established that 'blank"" and ""blank"" was now precedent. True or false?”* (These were often more difficult for me.)
* Actual Test: Focused more on *“What is the best way to approach this situation as an HR professional?”* (These were generally easier.)

You need to know the concepts, but your success depends on applying them to choose the most appropriate and ethically sound HR action. There may be multiple *right* answers, but generally you're asked to find the best one for the scenario.

**Day Of: Remote Testing Tips**

I took the test online. I actually almost missed my original appointment (or what I thought was my original appt time) because I didn't fully complete the sign-up/check-out process after picking a date (a small but confusing UI moment on the scheduling site—make sure you get to the final ""Submit Order"" screen and get a confirmation email!).

* System Check: I highly recommend running the system test via the HRCI site and OnVue the day before.
* Desk Setup (What worked for me): Laptop, charger, one unplugged monitor, bag under the desk, and a plain white coffee mug on the desk. This was all acceptable—I wasn't flagged for anything.
* Check-In: The ""check-in"" button presented itself 30 minutes before my scheduled time on the HRCI website. Follow the prompts for the room scan.

**Test-Taking Strategy (IMO - most vital to my success)**

My main strategy boiled down to a complete comprehension of the question and a process of elimination of the answers.

1. Understand the Question (The Real Battle): This is critical. For many questions, half the battle is truly understanding what is being asked. I often read questions 2 or 3 times, focusing on every word choice. For \~10-20 questions, my understanding of the question *actually changed* after several readings, which led me to the correct answer.
2. Process of Elimination: Once I understood the question, I read all the answers. I made a mental note of my ""gut feeling"" answer. Before selecting it, I tried to eliminate ones that didn't seem to fit. If my gut answer was still viable after the process of elimination, I stuck with it. And generally it was still viable.
3. Trust Your Gut: I only felt more confident then not in about \~25% of the answers. The rest I was either somewhat confident or 50/50 (I believe due to my recent lack of studying). I don't think there were any questions I felt like I was truly guessing on, though. Overall, I believe trusting my initial gut feeling and being decisive helped my odds of passing. I only flagged 2 questions for me to review at the end and I didn't use the extra time I had to 2nd guess my answers on any other questions (had about 50 mins to spare)
4. Format: Most were multiple-choice. My test had a handful of fill-in-the-blank questions, all requiring a number or calculation, not a term/name.

**Final Advice/Thoughts:**

1. Even if you study months ahead of time with no recent study opportunities, you may still retain a lot. Use your first attempt (if you get the 2nd chance insurance, **again highly recommend waiting for the free promotion**) to see where your knowledge is and what gaps you have (view your results afterwards for each category). And who knows, you may end up passing. 
2. Trust Your Understanding of Yourself: For me, this meant acknowledging my gaps outside of recruiting and hiring (when I did study, I focused my studying in other areas), but also knowing that my previous record of being a fairly effective test-taker meant I didn't need months of intense preparation.
3. Problem-Solve Each Question: Focus on fully comprehending what they're asking in the question, eliminate any answers you can, and listen to your gut.
4. The 2nd Chance Insurance is Golden: It’s also a double-edged sword (it made me not take the first attempt *too* seriously), but knowing I had the safety net was incredibly calming and it further encouraged me to not overthink my answers. I went into the test relaxed and could put my best effort forward without fear of failure. 

Feel free to ask any questions. Happy to share more about my experience if it can be helpful. Would love to hear other's experiences, too. Good luck, y'all.",1,1760444609.0,humanresources,0,1.0,False

first paying subscriber yesterday.

**what i did differently:**

**validated on reddit first** \- posted the core insight before building. 50+ upvotes = proof of demand.

**priced like coffee** \- €5/month. less than two coffees. removes ""let me think about it"" friction.

**solved ONE specific problem** \- not ""selling tips."" but ""how to email procurement managers without getting deleted.""

**gave 80% away free** \- full articles are free. paid tier is for weekly deep-dives.

**posted where my audience complains** \- salespeople vent about cold emails on reddit daily. i showed up with the solution.

**metrics after 5 days:**

* 1 paid subscriber
* 8 free subscribers
* €64 annualized revenue
* 0€ ad spend

Is it unreasonable to expect a bonus relationship to not be complicated?  I mean by nature there are inherent complications by default, communication apps, logistics, fallout, secrecy, lying, schedules, expenses etc.  And all of that is just part of this adventure.

Hit it & Quit it people don’t factor in because they know what they want and if you can’t recognize that from pretty much day 1, then you are probably fucked….literally then ghosted.

 

What I mean is: the great connections, excitement, mutual understanding, patience, something to look forward to, the up front talks/chats about expectations, availability, what you are looking for, why you do this, getting to know each other, being raw and honest and uninhibited, laughing, coffee dates, stolen phone calls, messages, eventually naughty and nice, ya know….the good stuff.

Then when everything is going about as amazing as possible, no suspicion at home, happiness, first meets all the way to  9,876 meets,  feeling alive again, finding “the groove”,  life at home is great as well because there is no pressure on your marriage for intimacy so with that cloud lifted you get along better, moods are improved, OPSEC A++ on both sides, etc. you are like finally I found “the one” and this is how it is supposed to be in an affair.



Then BOOOOOOMMMMMMMM.  They didn’t message back instantly, I must not be a priority, they are treating me like an AP and I feel used, well fuck them I’m gonna match energy and play emotional and communication chess, I love you, I can’t breathe without you, my entire life revolves around you, I want to run away together off into the sunset, what would life be like if we had met sooner, well he/she/kids must must be more important than me and now I know you don’t value me like I thought, I got curious and scrolled socials and now I’m intimidated, pissed, self conscience, inadequate, so much hotter than your spouse, no I don’t sleep with my spouse……that much,  oh, you didn’t respond in 36.9 seconds..ok, I’m gonna go scroll ads and find your replacement because you obviously don’t have time for me and I’m worth it,  your job was busy, your kid was sick, it’s your anniversary, birthday, vacation….FUCK all that, how can you have a life without me, I am your AP, I should be the only thing you ever think about and the only thing that makes you happy.



I love you, I hate you, I’m horny, I miss you….it’s ok if I’m busy, but how come you didn’t message me 20 times while I was living my actual life outside of adultery.  I can’t do this anymore, it’s too hard, it too easy to find someone new, it’s now boring, it’s now more work than my actually marriage, it’s run its course, these things never last.  I told my friends, spouse, etc because I was lonely and felt guilty, etc.

This is all rhetoric that happens, but you know why…because we took something that was so fun and fulfilling and exciting…..and made it complicated then act shocked when the other person doesn’t want to share their crayons or legos anymore.  KISS Keep it Simple (Sexy, Stupid,etc)



It can be simple and amazing if you remember what this is, and not try to make it something else,  but your worst enemy can be the one in the mirror just as easily.  It's ok to say NO and it's ok to ask for more, but when you aren't asking, you are just getting....that's when you have found the good one and embrace it for as long as it lasts and enjoy each other while you can.  Be reasonable and honest, but changing the dynamics mid affair is never a good idea.  And any of us who have done this a time or 2 know that it is amazing until it isn't, and when it isn't it is no longer worth it, no matter how amazing you think you are.  We are all selfish or self preserving at some point.

I’m about to show you how I turned everyday Amazon product reviews filmed in my living room into over €12,000 in passive commissions — without ads, a fancy camera, or a massive audience.

My first month’s payout? €7.  
Now, videos I filmed months ago are still making me money while I’m cooking dinner or chasing my kids around the house.

**The Strategy That Actually Works**

Forget all the “you need a big following” nonsense.  
Here’s the truth: Amazon doesn’t care how many followers you have — it cares if your videos help customers decide what to buy.

I started reviewing the stuff I already owned: my coffee machine, my tripod, my kid’s toys.  
Each video is 45–60 seconds max. Clear, honest, useful.

Now, those videos appear right on the product listings — where thousands of shoppers are already ready to buy. That’s how you make commissions while you sleep.

**My Upload System**

* 1–2 videos per day. Consistency beats aesthetics.
* All EU storefronts. Spain, France, Germany, Italy, UK — same videos, five times the reach.
* Pick high-traffic products. Not random items — things people are already searching for.

The more videos you upload, the more Amazon starts pushing them into carousels. Suddenly you’re getting paid for sales in five countries — without leaving your house.

**The Numbers So Far**

2025 earnings: **€12,000+** (and climbing)  
Average daily commissions: **€30–€70**  
Videos live across **5 marketplaces**  
Paid ads: **€0**  
Tools used: ChatGPT + Capcut + Canva + Coffee

**The Guide That Breaks It All Down**

I wasted 2 months trying to figure this out - you don't have to. 

I’ve put everything into one step-by-step guide — how to get approved, what videos to film, how to upload to all EU storefronts, and how to land free products and brand deals once your videos start taking off.

It’s not theory. It’s my exact process — the one that’s currently paying my bills.

**The Reality Check**

This isn’t an overnight thing.  
The first few weeks felt like I was filming for no one.  
Now, months later, I'm earning someone's 9-5 paycheck passively (up to 2k/month).

If you want quick dopamine hits, scroll TikTok.

1o6dwmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1o6dwmr/audio_from_hell_the_studio_recorded_more_than/,Audio from Hell – The Studio Recorded More Than Music.,"This is a story that my friend, Nicholas (a pseudonym), told me about something he experienced about 15 years ago when he was working at a recording studio in Manhattan.

I've compiled the details he shared, and I'll write it in his voice.
At the time, even though I was only working as an assistant, I dedicated myself to assisting a Senior Engineer for about four years.

Once I had learned all the ropes, the Senior Engineer asked me if I was ready to become a Staff Engineer.
To work as a Staff Engineer, I had to be able to handle all recording tasks alone.

It wasn't until I could manage everything—from meetings with the band to setting up, recording, tracking down, and the final sound adjustments—that I was considered fully competent.
To judge my ability, I had to take on a trial recording session.

Naturally, as someone still half-trained, I couldn't be in charge of recording a famous, skilled band.

I was assigned to an amateur band, preferably one that was not highly skilled.
It was a three-person amateur band of college students who made a reservation.

They wanted to record two songs as cheaply as possible and in a short amount of time, as it was their first time.

It's not a nice way to put it, but from the studio's perspective, they were a band we could afford to ""fail"" with.
I became the one in charge.

The recording was scheduled for two days, including the mix-down.
On the day of the session, after a brief meeting, we immediately started setting up the drums and bass, and the recording began.

The college students were reasonably competent, and the recording process went smoothly.
It happened while we were recording the guitar.

The guitarist stopped playing mid-performance and asked,

""Didn’t you just hear a woman’s voice?”
In recording, we essentially never speak to the person performing during a take.

Also, the voices of me, the engineer, and the other members waiting in the mixing room don’t reach the performer’s headphones unless we press a talkback button.

Of course, no one was speaking at that moment.
The guitar was being played in a small room called a booth, sealed by a thick door, so no external sound could get in.

I checked the recorded sound, but since there was no sound resembling a voice, I told him, “It must be your imagination,” and we continued recording.

Since certain guitar effects can actually produce sounds similar to a human voice, I didn’t worry about it at all.
The guitarist mentioned a few more times afterward, “I really feel like I heard a voice,” but the other members and I just dismissed it as his imagination.

Despite all that, the guitar recording was completed without issue.
All that remained were the lead vocals by the guitarist and the chorus parts by the other members—but here we ran into a problem.

We generally try not to record vocals across multiple days to avoid shifts in vocal quality mid-song, but the session time ran out just as the vocalist couldn’t quite nail the first song.
However, the remaining time was just one day tomorrow, including the mix-down.

So, I made a proposal to the members.
Fortunately, we had several takes of the vocals recorded.

I suggested that since I would already be compiling the best parts and correcting any pitch issues, we should start with the second song’s vocals tomorrow.
Most recording engineers use a tool called Pro Tools, and with this tool, you can fix not only pitch and rhythm issues but virtually any kind of error.

The college band members looked a little frustrated, as they couldn’t afford to spend too much money, but knowing they’d incur extra fees if they didn’t finish in one day, they reluctantly agreed.
After seeing the members off, my all-night work began.

I thought to myself, “If I can finish in about three hours, I can probably get five hours of sleep,” as I made myself some coffee and started fixing the vocals.
The work progressed more smoothly than I expected, and just as I finished fixing about half the song, I decided to take a break and tidy up the studio a bit to clear my head.

I was tidying up the cables in the booth and vacuuming when I thought I heard a woman’s scream, muffled by the sound of the vacuum cleaner.
I immediately stopped the vacuum.

The studio, where no external sound could enter, was enveloped in a silence so deep it hurt my ears.

I waited quietly for a while, but I didn’t hear the woman’s voice.
Just my imagination… or am I working too hard?

That’s what I thought.

And just as I was about to return to the mixing room from the booth, the song we recorded today suddenly started blasting out at a deafening volume.
“It must be a glitch,” I thought.

Even though the sound was supposed to be routed only to the headphones, a blaring noise was coming from the main, large speakers.
All the recorded audio data was stored on the HDD.

I saved the data periodically while I worked, but if the data were to be erased, that would be the worst-case scenario.
I rushed to the PC and pressed the stop button.

The song didn’t stop.
The college students’ song, which I had heard countless times today, kept playing.

I repeatedly pressed the stop button, but the song wouldn’t stop.

In fact, the PC stopped responding to any operation whatsoever.
I briefly considered turning off the power, but I couldn’t risk deleting the data.
As this was happening, noise began to mix into the song.

Mixed with the upbeat melody, I heard a “zzzz” sound, like an old radio, and a high-pitched “clank-clank” sound, like metal being struck.
“The whole system might have truly crashed…”
Just as I started thinking about giving up everything and shutting down the power,

a woman’s shriek—“AAAAAHHH!”—rang out at such a loud volume that it drowned out both the song and the preceding noise.
The woman’s shriek assaulted my frozen body repeatedly.

The speakers were making a cracking, distorted sound, as if they were about to break.
And then, from deeper within the woman’s shriek, I heard a child’s voice: a genuine, heart-wrenching crying sound, like “WAAAH!”
Next, I heard the sound of many adult men letting out a deep, guttural yell, like “WOOOAAAAH!”
Standing frozen, I imagined people running away from some enormous catastrophe.
Looking back now, I feel like this is the kind of audio you might capture if you placed a microphone in hell.

It was exactly the sound of countless agonizing screams the studio mic had picked up, as if connected to the darkness in the very depths of hell.

How long had passed?
It probably wasn’t even two minutes, but the screams, like cries of agony, gradually faded, and the original upbeat song by the college students returned.
This time, the song stopped normally when I pressed the stop button.
Dazed, I only pressed the data save button and decided to just get out of the studio and rest in the office break room.

In the break room was another Senior Engineer who was also staying overnight to work.

The Senior Engineer took one look at my face and asked,

“Did you lose some data?”
My face must have been extremely pale.
I told the Senior Engineer about the horrific, agonizing screams I had just encountered.

The Senior Engineer said,

“There’s nothing particularly known about this studio, but recording studios in general, not just this one, somehow have a lot of ghost stories.”
Indeed, I had also heard rumors about ghost stories at a famous studio in Los Angeles and Seattle.
Afterward, the Senior Engineer stayed with me in the studio, and somehow I managed to do the minimum necessary work until morning.

Despite all the horrific screaming, there was no anomaly in the audio file, and the second day of recording was completed without any problems.
Looking back now, perhaps something had already begun to transfer onto the audio file from the moment the guitarist said on the first day,
“Didn’t you just hear a woman’s voice?”
Ultimately, the truth remains unknown.

But I realized that such phenomena can happen whether a place has a history or not.
It’s impossible to truly convey those agonizing screams in text, but they were truly terrifying.
This was the first and last experience of its kind, but due to overworking myself with consecutive all-nighters, I ended up breaking down physically and quit before becoming a Staff Engineer.

I returned to my hometown and am now working in construction.
Now that I’ve talked about this experience from about 20 years ago, it makes me wonder:

1o6dta8,https://i.redd.it/zivtxhu9j2vf1.jpeg,"We analyzed 1,527videos to find a 3-part 'Shareability Formula.'","My team recently did a deep dive to figure out why some marketing videos go viral while others flop, focusing on the hotel industry. We analyzed **1,527 hotel videos from July to September 2025** to find the exact moments that guests feel compelled to share.

Our key insight is a lesson for any brand:

Most brands sell a ""brochure."" But customers share a ""feeling."" 

It’s the difference between a staged, perfect photo and the feeling of relief when you drop your bags after a long trip. That's the moment people connect with, don't you feel the same?



Our analysis revealed a surprisingly simple, 3-part formula for creating that feeling.

# The Shareability Formula

* 1. The Arrival Moment: This is the hook:the first breath when the user ""enters"" the experience. That first impression is critical.
* 2. The Sensory Test: This is about depth and immersion. Let the audience *feel* the details through evocative sound and texture, like the rustle of fabric or the clink of a cup. It’s not just visual; it's a full sensory experience.
   * **Data:** Posts with sensory audio get **2.1x more comments**.
* 3. The View Reveal: This is the payoff: the ""wow"" moment that makes the experience a story worth telling.
   * **Data:** A dramatic ""curtain reveal"" has a **3.5x higher share rate** than any other shot.

The formula is essentially: **Arrival + Sensation + View = Shareability**.

# Why this matters for AI Branding:

This isn't just about hotels; it's a data-backed framework for creating emotionally resonant content.

* **Smarter Prompting:** Instead of asking an AI image generator for ""a cool product shot,"" you can prompt it with this formula: ""Create a POV shot of a person *arriving* at a desk, with a macro shot of steam rising from a coffee cup (*sensation*), revealing a beautiful city skyline outside the window (*view*).""
* **Predictive Analysis:** You can use AI tools to analyze your own industry's top-performing content to find your unique ""shareability formula.""
* **Rapid Prototyping:** Use this framework to generate dozens of AI video storyboards, testing different ""Arrivals,"" ""Sensations,"" and ""Views"" for your product or service before spending a dime on production.

It's about moving from selling a product to selling the *moment*.

So, how could you apply this **Arrival / Sensation / View** formula to your own brand or industry? Would love to hear your ideas in the comments :)",1,1760444006.0,AIBranding,0,1.0,False
1o6dsdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1o6dsdc/my_unpopular_opinionshot_takes/,My unpopular opinions/hot takes,"1. Dean is overhated. I am oftentimes frustrated by the grace that is extended to other men in the show forgetting that for the original run, Dean is a teenager. Yes, it’s not cool he gets mad at Rory for not saying “I love you back” but I read that as a teenage boy who was insecure that his girlfriend didn’t love him back. The Donna Reed episode is cringe, but I never took that as proof that Dean wanted a trad wife. Dean also constantly affirms her passion for Harvard, he doesn’t always get it right, but he wants Rory to achieve that goal. I also hate how he gets most of the blame for the cheating scandal, when Rory shows a pattern of cheating (from when she was dating Dean! The emotional cheating and kiss with Jess is absolutely cheating). 
2. As much as we hate the cheating of Rory and Dean, it makes so much sense canonically. Rory has had a dry spell in dating. At Chilton, Dean, Tristan, and Jess are all interested in her. Now Rory goes to Yale and suddenly there’s no male attention. She wants something safe and something reliable, enter Dean. I tend to believe that it is true that Lindsay didn’t want to go to work and while I think Dean is in the wrong for this, he was still in love with Rory when he married Lindsay. He also messed up the relationship by not communicating with Lindsay from the beginning that he had feelings for Rory. 
3. Dave is idolized. There’s a chance he would have been “ruined” had he stayed longer on the show. Lane and Zach in my opinion aren’t bad. Their wedding was a fun scene (I loved the White Stripes wedding cake homage). 
4. Emily Gilmore is emotionally abusive. Richard Gilmore is also emotionally abusive. Yes, sometimes they are right about Lorelai. Yes, I do believe that they love and do what THEY think is best for Lorelai and Rory, but the key words are what they think is best. Multiple times they get involved in the girl’s love lives. Multiple times they cross boundaries that are not cool. I’ve seen a recent uptick in fans defending their behavior, which most of the time is rooted in classism and racism. 
5. I think the show is a fantastic example of generational trauma and the limits of the WASP culture. I find it offensive when in marketing it gets boiled down to “coffee coffee coffee”. The show is smart, containing jokes with layers. The cultural references are on point. I first started watching it because of people saying it was THE show for Autumn, and while I agree, what kept me was the generational conflict, these are still relevant 25 years later.
6. I think Logan is Rory’s end game. It took a while for Jess to grow on me. I mean, several rewatches. But where Rory and Jess end up, I don’t think it would make sense for them to end up together. I’d like to see them be friends, I could see them actually being good friends. While Jess has grown, we haven’t seen him really commit to anything, and Rory needs someone who commits to her. I feel like if Rory wasn’t so stubborn and told Logan to call off the engagement to Odette, Logan most likely would. I imagine if the baby was Logan’s, he most likely would call it off to Odette even if Rory and him didn’t get immediately back together. But I think Logan is her end game because he’s apart of the life that Rory has adapted herself to. Yes, we see her in AYTIL fail, but she also has trust funds backing her and multiple connections of where to stay. I think Jess would be uncomfortable with the amount of financial support Rory has. Logan pushed Rory when she needed, but also let her shine on her own. 
7. The Luke and Lorelai build up was AMAZING. The relationship… no. I hate how they dumbed Luke down as the show went on. 
8. Christopher sucks but I don’t hate him as nearly as much as some fans. I do think he knows Lorelai, but damn is he a shitty dad. He definitely could have been around more for Rory. 
9. I dislike Max Medina. For one, he’s unprofessional dating the mother of one of his students, especially when said student is struggling to adapt to the Chilton environment. Two, he’s pushy. He constantly crosses boundaries Lorelai puts up, and to me that’s a red flag. Three, he wants to discipline Rory and I find that weird that he was so insistent in that role. As Lorelai says, she would handle it. Rory is sixteen/seventeen at this point. For someone to come in and ask what their role is in parenting Rory, I don’t know, it felt weird to me.

After a few minutes, I looked back — no one was there. I thought it was over, so I kept walking. But then a navy-blue car with two or maybe three white guys pulled up near me. The weird thing is, they must’ve kept an eye on me — because the road layout there means they’d have had to make a U-turn to come back on the same side where I was walking. So they clearly came back for me.

But the moment he called me again he said Oi and I recognise that voice bcz I didnt see any of their face. I turned back and looked and him and he called out, “What’s your age?” I asked “Why?” — I don’t even know where that courage came from. Then he said something like he or his friend wanted to have coffee, give me a lift, or go on a date. I didn't even listen it all what he said.

I immediately said “no”. I stood right in front of a random house and decided that if they got out of the car, I’d run straight inside. They looked at me for a few seconds and asked no? then finally drove away. I waited until the car was completely gone before walking home.

*July 27, 2025*

We have been together almost 20 years not, married for 15, grown kid.

We were on a vacation and I had not planned anything I really wanted to see. Well it was a ""working vacation"" she was going a training and I had driven us there to go along. When the weekend came she asked what I would like to do? I had not really planned or looked into anything, and she got a little irritated. This lead too an argument. I guess more of a vent session than an argument, I didn't really say much back TBH.

She said I need to be more proactive and take the lead more in our lives and not be a passenger along for the ride. Pointing out how I rarely pick movies to watch, or how I had not even bothered to look up any places to eat or things to do around the city we were in. This went on for a little while and she said that it gets old to having a cardboard cut out of a husband and that she wants a person who has opinions and is curious about the world around, not just along for the ride.

I will admit I had not thought of things to do while we were on this trip and I could have, I had lots of spare time the say she did the training. We didn't really talk much the drive home. I think this has been stirring for a while, and is probably more than not looking up things to do on the trip. I always thought letting her take the lead would allow her to get what she wants and make her happy. I guess it is not what she wants and now I am kind of lost on how to take more initiative and be more proactive in life and our relationship. I really don't have many close friends to ask things like this of, and probably wouldn't even if I did.

My question is how do I learn to be more proactive in my relationship before it's too late?

tl;dr went on a trip and got into a fight because I didn't plan anything to do in out off time. How do I become more proactive and take the lead more?

># Consensus:

OOP is ripped a new one.

># Notable Comments:


You are mixing things up. She has asked you to become a person with their own wants, needs and opinions (again). You interpret that as having to lead, but those are different things. I fear that you are one of those people who just got lost in their relationship, because it's easier than doing things yourself. Doing things yourself is also how you get back to being your own person. You say you let your wife take the lead so she'd be happy, but have you considered that it is also exhausting to think for two people? And that she might like conversations where you give a different perspective instead of ageeeing (the your own opinions comment sounds like this). It's not about leading. It's about being your own person and not just a prop for her life. Start with this: for the next weekend you think about something YOU would like to do, can be something you used to like or something new, then YOU make the plans and do it. Then maybe start a new hobby. Find a sport, learn a language, find some sight/cities you want to visit. Plan a date (and with that I mean from beginning to end so she only has to show up) and then have conversations where you won't blindly agree, but contribute your own points. Maybe you even bring up a new topic of conversation. All of those things aren't leading, they are being an individual that offers something (other than giving up everything that made them THEM) in a relationship. [[Expensive-Wish799]](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mae7ae/i_m40_got_into_an_argument_with_my_wife_f39/n5e14cx/)
> That makes a lot of sense really. I often get lost in conversations with her, she is very up to date on the news and current events, I am not so much so many times I don't have opinions on things she says. You are probably right about kind of blindly agreeing on some stuff. Makes a lot of sense really. **[OOP]**
>> It's not meant to come of harsh, I just keep seeing people (not only men!) getting into relationships and then loosing themselves. And that can be really frustrating for a spouse that wants a real partner and she married you so you must have been that at some point. Also, it is good for you to have your own life. It's healthy. It means that you don't rely only on your partner to fulfill you. That is very important because you could loose her for whatever reason and if she is the only most important thing in your life you will have a way harder time to live on somehow. I really hope that you don't see your wife's blowup as the reason you are doing this but as a wake up call, and your own wellbeing as the reason. Because that is really what it comes down to, being more interesting to your wife is just the bonus.

>>Also: I pointed out the difference between leading and being your own person because nowadays it's very easy to fall into a bad rabbit hole if you confuse them. [Expensive-Wish799]
>>> That's a hard thing to think about honestly, but your right it should also be about my own well being and being more interesting to her would also make things better as well. I can imagine there are lots of dark rabbit holes around relationships. Thanks for the warning. **[OOP]**

>>>>OP, I think I understand you more than some of these harsh comments because I am the same. It doesn’t manifest itself exactly like your situation, but darn close.

>>>>I’ve sometimes felt like I had a wax covering or bubble or whatever between me and the world. It’s partly a defense mechanism from childhood with some adult trauma thrown in, some other mental health issues, and a bunch of other crap, so yeah, it’s complicated.

>>>>What I would suggest for you is while you look for ways to actively engage with your wife, you find a therapist that can help you unpack how you got here. How you’re a passenger in your own life. How you can become more invested in your life and how you can direct those changes.

After I made my original post I spent a lot of time thinking about what she and people here had said, not just about planning date nights, picking TV shows, or being more up to date on news/current events, but more about showing up as my own person in our relationship. I realized that for years I thought being ""easy going"" was a good thing. I thought that by going along with what she wanted I was being a good partner and letting her have what she wanted, but really I was avoiding responsibility or taking risk in our relationship. I wasn't showing her who I am or putting any care into anything.

I have made a few changes since my post, I have planned some date nights and things to do instead of waiting for her to make plans for us to avoid doing nothing ( a problem we had fallen into.) Some times she likes what I have planned, sometime not so much, but I think she appreciates the effort.

I have been speaking up and paying attention more, even about little things. What I think about a tv show or place we have been for the first time. Offering more than ""It was okay"" or ""it was alright"" but offering some actual opinions that don't dead end the conversation. I have been paying attention more to the news and current events, and even though many times I don't really have an opinion about things I offer what I can to show some interest. It's awkward at times, but better than just doing nothing.

I am also reconnecting with some interests that I had let go over the years, been more willing to spend time with some friends instead of choosing to stay home and scroll. I have also restarted some old hobbies, hiking and mineral collecting, which I can do on my own, or she has come with me a few times. She seems happy I am out doing things on my own and reconnecting with friends after so many years I think.

The biggest change was how I think about ""taking initiative"" and ""taking the lead"", it's not about being the boss or the one to make all the decisions, it's about being present and curious about the world and what is around me and wanting to do more when we are on a trip than sitting on my phone and scrolling for hours.

So in an almost exact mirror of what happen in my last post, again last weekend we traveled so she could give another training and I drove us there. Again she took the car, but instead of just hanging out in the hotel room and waiting for her to come back, I used the bus system and went to the worlds biggest comic shop, saw a few historical/touristy spots, had lunch and found a huge flea market for us to go to on Sunday morning before driving home. It was a very different weekend than the last. She was most surprised when I had picked an Indian spot for dinner Saturday night, I am not a very adventurous eater and have shied away from trying foreign foods, this was my first time trying Indian, and she has always been an adventurous eater so I really caught her off guard with that,

There is still work to do, but I think we are in a much better place than when I posted before. She has said she has seen a difference and said she feels she is seeing me be more ""me"" again.

Thanks to the people who responded to my OG post, your advise helped, even the harsh replies.

tl;dr Update, got in a argument about being to passive, think things are in a better place now.

># Comments by OOP:

I remembered the reply, about making lists, and I started doing that. I felt a little kicked when my kid said I could keep notes in my phone when I was asking where to find a ""police style spiral nope pad."" I should have thought there would be an app for that.

____

I am, honestly it is exactly like that, looking around again instead of just letting the world pass by. There are parts in movies where they show the monotony of life and I had really fallen into that pattern, I am enjoying caring about what goes on around more than the weather.

____

>In general, now you're more curious about the world, does that keep feeding your curiosity? Like do you find yourself wanting to explore more things? Make more plans for the future?

It does, I had not really thought about traveling much in a long time, but I do think about places I would like to see, I also have started listening to more ""talk"" kind of things while I work instead of just a playlist of music all the time, which I never did before.

____

>I hope this leads you towards a happier ending than your original destination.

I already think the ship has turned from hitting the iceberg, but you are right I need to keep on the lookout and not let myself slip back where I was.

____

[Indian food] wasn't anything like I had imagined honestly. I got mixed grill thing that was lamb, chicken and shrimp with a yogurt type sauce, and she had Chicken something in a sauce. It was decent, I shouldn't have been so avoidant to trying it before honestly.

This used to be scheduling, being fr I’d open my laptop, notes everywhere, coffee next to me full study mode setup and then somehow end up cleaning my desk, checking one random notification or falling into a 45-minute YouTube same loop about productivity itself. It was like I was constantly getting ready to study but never actually studying. I’d tell myself, ok from tomorrow I’ll be serious, then tomorrow would come and I’d start with just 10 mins on my phone that turned into an hour.  
  
I tried everything from long to-do lists that looked pretty but were impossible to finish, Pomodoro timers that made me feel rushed, waking up at 5am for two days straight before crashing back into noon wakeups. Some days I’d be super strict and plan every minute, other days I’d just wing it completely. And by the end of the week I’d feel burnt out, behind and weirdly guilty for not doing enough. It was exhausting.  
  
Then I realized I didn’t really have structure  I was just relying on motivation that came and went. So I started small. I used Notion to plan just 3 main things per day and yea no aesthetic layouts, no extra fluff. Then I synced it with Google Calendar so my phone would actually remind me when to start. I also tried Calendy for setting small study sessions with friends so I couldn’t bail last minute.  
  
A few weeks in, I found Jolt screen time that literally LOCKS  distracting apps when I start a focus session - honestly, that alone saved me from the endless Instagram “just checking” loops. Pairing that with Calm during breaks helped me reset instead of doom-scrolling.  
  
Now I’m not saying I’ve cracked the code or anything, but I’ve stopped calling myself lazy. I just needed a rhythm, not guilt. I still have off days, but at least now I know why I’m off track instead of thinking something’s wrong with me.

For years, I thought I had zero self-control. Every night I'd promise myself ""last time,"" and every morning I'd wake up feeling like shit—drained, ashamed, foggy. I'd make it 3-4 days, then relapse harder. The cycle felt permanent.

Then I learned something that changed everything: I wasn't weak. My brain had been rewired by supernormal stimuli that evolution never prepared us for. Modern porn delivers dopamine spikes 200-400% higher than actual sex. Your brain can't tell the difference between pixels and reality—it just knows it's getting flooded with reward chemicals.

**Here's what actually worked:**

**The 72-Hour Hell Zone:** Days 1-3 are pure neurochemical withdrawal. Your brain is screaming for its dopamine fix. I had to physically leave my apartment during high-risk times—coffee shops, gym, libraries, anywhere public. The urges peaked around day 2, then started dropping. Just knowing this helped me push through.

**Replace, Don't Erase:** You can't just delete a habit. When urges hit, I'd immediately do 50 pushups or take a freezing shower. The physical shock reset my nervous system. Sounds extreme, but desperation works.

**Nuke Your Triggers:** Website blockers, phone out of bedroom, deleted Instagram (those ""suggested"" posts aren't innocent). I treated my environment like substance abuse recovery—because neurologically, that's what this is.

**The Game-Changer: Accountability That Actually Works:** This is where I'd always failed before. I'd try to white-knuckle it alone, then relapse in secret. What finally worked was having real-time accountability. I found this app that tracks your progress and sends you reminders during your high-risk hours. It's not some AI bullshit—it's designed specifically for breaking addictive patterns. Watching my streak grow became its own dopamine reward, and during those brutal first weeks, having something ping me right when I was about to relapse literally saved me multiple times. I also joined [r/pornfree](/r/pornfree/) and [r/nofap](/r/nofap/) for community support.For additional help [https://toronto.soberlivingnetwork.org/](https://toronto.soberlivingnetwork.org/) , [https://linktr.ee/soberlivingnetwork](https://linktr.ee/soberlivingnetwork) one can join these

**The Chaser Effect:** This one saved me. After a relapse, I'd binge for days thinking ""already failed, fuck it."" Learning this pattern had a name helped me stop the spiral. One slip doesn't erase weeks of healing. Your brain is literally rewiring during clean days.

**The withdrawal was brutal.** Brain fog, irritability, couldn't sleep, felt depressed for two weeks. But around day 21, something shifted. Energy came back. Anxiety dropped. I could look people in the eye. By day 90, I felt like a different person—sharper, more confident, actually present in conversations.

**Real talk:** This addiction doesn't just steal your time. It steals your energy, your focus, your ability to connect with actual humans. Every hour in that cycle is an hour you're not building the life you want.

The shame keeps you trapped. The secrecy keeps you sick. The belief that ""this is just who I am"" keeps you stuck.

But you're not stuck. Neuroplasticity is real. The same pathways that got hijacked can be rewired. Usually takes 90 days minimum for significant changes, sometimes 6-12 months for full reboot, but it's absolutely possible.

I'm not gonna bullshit you—it's hard. I still get urges sometimes. But now I have tools, not just willpower. I understand my triggers. I've built a life where I don't need the escape anymore.

If you're reading this and feeling that pit in your stomach because you relate too hard—start today. Not Monday. Not next week. Right fucking now.

The person you're supposed to be is on the other side of this.

The app I used [This app](https://phoenix-motivation.onelink.me/5153/m7vskid2)—it's basically a reminder system that pings you during your vulnerable hours. Sounds simple, but when you're in that autopilot mode at midnight, a well-timed notification can snap you out of it.

He was surprised I always ordered cold drinks even as we hit December and it was cold AF out. I sheepishly admitted I didn’t like tea or coffee but loved the mango iced frappe they had and it was my uni budget approved treat every week or so. Bored and sensing opportunity to spice up his own workday he offered to come up with something funky based on it for me to try and I agreed. 
His concoction was something along the lines of:
Mango juice base
Milk
White chocolate syrup (trust me)
Ice
Blend!

He’d cal it the Mango white mocha for me and he’d always perk up when he saw me and start making it before I even paid. No idea the ratios but guys, it tasted JUST like a Solero ice cream👌🏻 it was incredible and I went back throughout uni to get it nearly every week when I could. I’d tie in my grocery trips into town to drop by and grab one. I was really sad when I had to move back home at the end of my degree and return to my old job and family home as I felt stupid asking for this off menu concoction to people who wouldn’t get how nice it tasted from the ingredient.

But… new off menu options had opened up!
They did this lime refresher iced drink that summer after graduation that was basically just a lime squash tbh, but the Starbucks in my old job (motorway services, boring as hell) were also keen to do something stupid or funky for staff (pros of staff discount that overlapped) so they were happy to add the lime to the mango base for something slightly different free of charge! (They also used to make me double drinks and the staff discount was 50% off so I’d basically get them for like 75% off so whilst being an incredibly crap place to work the perks made it survivable)

Hi all I (31 NB) wanted to post because when I was researching other experiences with getting sterilized on the NHS there were a few experiences which varied quite a lot, but they were all very helpful,.

I wanted to add mine so that others will have info to go from. Apologies for the length - I was to make sure I've covered as much detail as I can in case it is helpful

Edit: adding near top so not buried.. im in England and everything was done through North Bristol NHS Trust.  

Timeline:

I initially brought up getting sterilized with my GP last September (2024).

I was there to get my Nexplanon implant replaced as it had run out. Initially she was a little hesitant given my age and not having had any children. And was saying about changing mind and possibility of regret etc, but then suddenly stopped herself and said ""actually, you know what, I wouldn’t be pushing this hard with a 16yo who was pregnant, and you seem to have looked into this"" so she sent the referral.

 

20/01/2025 I was given an appointment with the local health center gyno, and went in prepared with all the reasons I didn’t want children, the fact I had had Nexplanon for about 10 years, and preference for a Bi-salp due to reduced ectopic pregnancy chance and 80% reduction of ovarian cancer risk.

By the time I got through the stats he stopped be and said he was happy that I was serious, had tried other long term contraceptives and had done my research, but due to my age, it was the local NHS trust policy (North Bristol) to refer for a second gyno opinion. Also advised that he was the only gyno in the local health center, So I would likely have to go to Southmead hospital.

 

I received a copy of the letter he had sent in the post a couple of weeks later.

 

13/05/2025 I had my appointment with the second gyno. He had read the supporting letter, so advised he didn’t feel the need to go through all of the bits around having looked into other options etc, so said he would instead focus on the surgery itself, what it would entail and risks.

I once again advised that I wanted a bi-salp, at which point he went to double check with the surgeon that he hadn't missed any info. He came back and added that he had to advise that it would be non-reversable. And that I would only be able to get pregnant after via IVF- which the NHS wouldn’t cover.  I Said ""Good"" which he laughed at and then showed me him typing Bilateral Salpingectomy in the surgical request box. And asked for any planned holidays in the next few months - I advised I had a holiday planned for beginning of October.    Again I got a letter summary a couple of weeks later.

 

I had a call in august to go through pre-op questions for anaesthetic - and they said at this point that they weren't sure on timescale but I would hear once I reached the top of the list.

 

On 26/09/2025 I had a phone call offering my a surgery date. They said they know I get back from holiday the day before but the slots had come up. I asked if I could call back to confirm as I wanted to check with my partner and she said okay as long as it was within an hour.

I called back 20 mins later to accept day for 11/09/2025 (a Saturday).

 

Day of Surgery 11/10/2025:

I went in at 11 as requested, and they showed me to a private recovery room, with chairs and bit, and advised that’s where I would be for the day. They said that there were a few people ahead of me so I would likely be going in for surgery about 2pm.  The initial nurse ran through basic bits and pieces, asked me to remove jewelry and gave me wrist tags. A little while later the surgeon came in to run through the surgical consent form.

He did ask how many children I had, and when I said none, he went ""oh"",  and did ask about my process with getting to this point, and say the biggest risk of the operation was regret. I advised I had spoken to my GP, and 2 Gynos and was very firm in my decision. He also asked if I can considered other forms of contraceptives such as condoms, IUD or Vasectomy (this last point was directed at my partner, who just said that this surgery was about me and it isn't relevant to the convo (My partner will also be getting a vasectomy, I just started things going sooner)).

The surgeon seemed happy after this then asked if I wanted clips or full tube removal, I specified tube removal due to safer etc: he agreed and wrote it down. Signed the consent form and said he would see me after it was all done.

I then told my partner to go home as it was going to be at least another 5 hours.

After this the nurse got me to do vitals and a pregnancy test, and to change into the gown and put on compressions socks and I chilled with a book for a bit.

The anestheologist also came in to run through the sedation process and how that would work.

At about 2.30pm, I was asked to walk to the surgery room, where they got me wired up, inserted cannula, and chatted a little about cats and game of thrones. They reassured me they'd take good care of me and I was out.

 

I woke up at about 4pm in the original room I was in earlier, a little groggy, and stomach feeling like I had done wayyy too many sit ups. Nurse asked pain levels I said about 4 - so she gave me some water and a codeine tablet.  I recovered from the groggyness quite quickly, got my glasses back, and had some biscuits and a coffee.  Because they were fairly please they said I could call my partner to come get me.

The surgeon came back in, said everything had gone very smoothly, tubes came out nicely but that he had noted a little bit of endrometiosis on the pelvic wall. He did specify that it wasn’t enough to generally cause any concern, or need treatment at this point, but as he dealt with it a lot he recognised and would note down. I will note that I have not really had any symptoms of concern either. He was in a bit of a rush, and left (I assume to go home as was Saturday evening).

The nurse got me to pee, and confirmed she was happy for me to get dressed. I had some bleeding from 2 of the 3 incision sites, so she put a couple of dressings on and gave me some to take home too. 

I was not given any painkillers, as she advised I should be ok with ibuprofen and paracetamol, but I was struggling I should get some co-codamol otc.

I asked about sick note - and she checked a realised the surgeon had forgotten it. As he was gone for the day, she said I can call in Monday to the clinic and they will email me over.

I also managed to get a photo of the laparoscopy camera images they had taken- which do show before and after of the tubes being removed, and what I assume is the endometriosis.

 

My partner then picked me up, and stopped on the way for the Co-codamol. I was fairly sore at this point, walking gingerly, and some pain in middle and right side if I twisted too hard.

Got home to find my partner had got me flowers, chocolate and prosecco to celebrate (for once I'm allowed alcohol after 24h)

 

Recovery:

I slept ok, but just on my back. Theres definitely swelling across my abdomen, and I can feel the gas remains sort of bubbling around, with some pain in my ribs and shoulders.

Getting out of bed was quite painful, but once up and about its doable, just need a bit of support going from sitting to standing.

 

Work had already ring-fenced 2 weeks off for me, so I am going to ask for this as sick note tomorrow, and I'm feeling better than I was expecting - I'm just not sure I'll be up for the 4 miles of walking that is my commute with a semi- heavy bag.

 

Again sorry for the essay, I had read several accounts on here and they had all been very helpful, so I wanted to do my due diligence.

I tried every productivity hack until I finally this 10 strategies

Here’s what’s been working FOR ME after 6 months of experimenting

**1. Time-block like you a job**  
Instead of saying “I’ll study later”, I plan study blocks on Google Calendar and treat them like real meetings. This short video helped me a ton:  
[https://youtu.be/3s2gS3pFHPg?si=IqrgZHtma3TpiDIb](https://youtu.be/3s2gS3pFHPg?si=IqrgZHtma3TpiDIb)

**2. The “5-minute activation” trick**  
When I don’t feel like studying, I promise myself *5* minutes only. That small start almost. There’s some science behind it, it’s called the “activation energy” principle (worth Googling if you’re curious).

**3. Study with others**  
I started using [this site](https://www.studystream.live/home?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=13) it’s a 24/7 virtual coworking space where you join live focus rooms with other students. No talking, just accountability. Seeing 200+ people studying in real time kills procrastination, like you are in library

**4. Block distractions like your life depends on it**  
Apps like [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/) and [Freedom](https://freedom.to/?irpid=56411&subId1=1-g-Cj0KCQjw3aLHBhDTARIsAIRij59hh05xb2IZShD_m6lS1d-RfMCHXEJSPbPmD3qoIusw2i618xexT_gaAqI1EALw_wcB&utm_source=affiliate&utm_campaign=56411&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=808733665&gbraid=0AAAAADLv4uSBNq1p5LzMwxGpG1MCeruAH&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3aLHBhDTARIsAIRij59hh05xb2IZShD_m6lS1d-RfMCHXEJSPbPmD3qoIusw2i618xexT_gaAqI1EALw_wcB) are lifesavers, but honestly, the simplest hack is to put your phone in another room. If you want to understand why your brain keeps reaching for it, this video blew my mind: [ Why you can’t focus – Andrew Huberman explains dopamine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwQhKFMxmDY) 

**5. Romanticize the process**  
Make your study setup feel good, clean desk, warm lighting, lo-fi beats, your favorite drink. It may seem silly, but the brain needs a lot of order.

**6. Reward yourself like you’re training a dog (because you kind of are)**  
I set small rewards: finish a chapter: take a coffee. finish an assignment: 15 min scroll.  
This alspo sounds silly, but it trains your brain to associate focus with pleasure.

**7. Keep a “done list” instead of a “to-do list”**  
Writing what I completed instead of what I still need to do gives a crazy dopamine boost.  
I track mine in Notion

**8. Change locations once a day**  
Studying in the same spot drains you. I rotate between my desk, a café, or my bed (controversial, I know). If you can’t leave home, just change the lighting or background music. it tricks your brain into a “fresh start.”

**9. Mix subjects and methods**  
Alternate between reading, note-taking, and active recall. Active recall literally reprograms your memory [ Ali Abdaal’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE) explains it way better than I can.

**10. Lower the pressure, raise the consistency**  
Stop chasing the “perfect study day.” Two consistent hours a day beats ten chaotic ones.  
I stopped aiming for motivation and started building systems. Hope this can help some of you :)

I thought I was over it, but I just saw on Instagram that he already has a new girlfriend and it broke me in a way I didn’t expect.

When we first met, he had nothing. He had quit his job, was unemployed, and later didn’t even have money for school. Out of love, I paid his tuition with the savings from my part-time job. That was a huge deal for me, but he ended up dropping out and never paid me back. I also gave him money for dental work, paid for most of our dates, and planned everything because he never really took initiative.

About a year in, I caught him messaging other girls. I was devastated but gave him another chance… then another. He cheated on me multiple times — whether it was dating apps, flirty texts, or late night messages from random women. I really tried making it work with him, but he just kept disappointing me and abusing my trust.

Despite all of that, I kept trying to support him. I let him use my car for his driving test (he scratched it, and the mark is still there). I helped him with his résumé, which he copied directly from mine and even lied on. He finally got a job once, but got let go in less than 3 months. Even when he was working, he never tried to pay me back. Instead, he lived off government money, and when that ran out, he’d lash out at me.

I broke up with him once before but went back when he called. That became our cycle. And even when things were “good,” he never gave me anything back. I spent thousands on hotels, food, concerts, and birthdays. He never got me a birthday gift — meanwhile, I was taking him to steak dinners and booking nice hotel rooms for his.

Last year, I got pregnant. He promised he’d work two jobs if I kept the baby, but I knew he couldn’t provide. I made the painful decision to have an abortion. It broke me, but I knew bringing a child into that situation would’ve destroyed me and he wouldn’t be able to support me at all. I know I’d feel financially stressed.

This past December, I found out he was still cheating and in January he was on a dating app, and that was the final straw. I ended it in February. For months he blew up my phone and email with long, emotional apologies saying I was the love of his life. But after so many betrayals, I couldn’t take him seriously. In June, I sent my last email where I told him he was dead to me, and then I blocked him everywhere. He also sent me another email late June saying that if the tables have turned, he would be open to talking to me and pretty much talked a lot shit about me. He also sent me one last email he saying good luck with sleeping with countless men until I find my person and pretty much talked about alot shit. 

In September, I stalked his Instagram. He’s already in a new relationship, posting happy date pictures. And it crushed me. Instead of working on himself, fixing his life, or even taking time to reflect, or improving himself to prove to me that he’s worthy of me..he just jumped into something new.

When I left him, I felt free — like a huge weight off my chest. I focused on myself, my hobbies, and my career. I thought I was doing well. But seeing him move on so quickly has reopened everything I tried to bury.

He still owes me about $4,000. I’ll probably never get back. I gave him years of my life, my savings, and my love — and all I got in return was heartbreak. His family even told me I was the best thing that ever happened to him, and maybe I was. But he definitely wasn’t the best thing for me.

I know he doesn’t deserve me, but it still hurts. I hate that I miss him sometimes, after everything he put me through.

Recently, I made a video to expresses my feelings and pretty much told him my side of the story and it was around 30 mins. I emailed it to him which he watched and he ended up emailing me back. If you want to see it, you can dm me. Tbh, his response isn’t very sincere and asked to meet for coffee. As much as I want to say yes, I declined him. 

It was his birthday recently and I wished him happy birthday. I know I shouldn’t but couldn’t help it. I still love and miss him and I hate that I do. I wish I can feel nothing about him but that’s not the case. ",2,1760442842.0,AvoidantBreakUps,1,1.0,False

1o6dcn4,https://thenextinternetbillionaire.com/make-money-online/,Make Money Online - Unlimited Ways to Generate Income,"# Tired of the 9-5 Grind? Your Blueprint for Building Real Income Online Starts Here

The dream of making money online is more alive than ever. But let’s be honest: between the “guru” hype and the overwhelming number of “methods,” it’s easy to feel lost. I know because I was there, trading hours for dollars in a job I tolerated. My journey out started with one simple shift: I stopped chasing “easy money” and started building a real, sustainable online business. And you can too.

At the heart of a sustainable online business is passive income—earning money with minimal daily effort after the initial work is done. Think of it like planting a tree. You do the hard work of digging and planting once, and for years it provides shade.

The internet offers several powerful ways to plant these “trees.” 

You might promote other companies’ products as an affiliate, create and sell a digital course, build a website that earns from advertising, operate a dropshipping or ecommerce website, capture leads and either sell to them directly or sell the leads to companies, create a recurring subscription membership website, or make money from different AI models. The key isn’t to try them all at once, but to find the one that best fits your skills and goals.

My name is Onaolapo Adeyemi, and I’m a computer engineer by training but a teacher at heart. This isn’t just theoretical for me. I’ve built my own passive income streams using the exact methods I’ll share. Now, my mission is to cut through the noise and give you the clear, actionable roadmap I wish I’d had.

Why? Because an American self-help legend, Zig Ziglar, once said, “You can get everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want.” That philosophy is at the core of everything I teach.

>Zig Ziglar

This isn’t just talk. This is a proven path. Don’t just take my word for it—see real examples of simple websites generating passive income right now:

* AdSense Revenue Sites: [Belly Fat Loss](https://belly-fat-loss.info/), [EMDR Therapist](https://1emdr.com/)
* Affiliate Marketing Sites: [How to Save A Marriage](https://howtosaveamarriagetips.com/), [Bronx Computer Repairs](https://bronxcomputerrepairs.com/), [Healthy Kids Meals](https://healthykidsmeals.info/)
* E-commerce/Dropshipping Sites: [Bracelets Mama](https://braceletsmama.com/), [Amazing Deals](https://1amazingdeals.com/)

These sites earn money for their owners month after month. They started as just an idea, just like yours.

So, you’ve seen what’s possible. But with so many models—from affiliate marketing to advertising to creating your own products—how are you supposed to choose the right one and actually get started without wasting time and money?

# Stop the Overwhelm. Find Your Perfect Path.

That exact question—”How do I choose the right one?”—is why I created a simple, free tool for you.

Introducing the “Passive Income Model Selector” Checklist. This isn’t another vague guide. It’s a step-by-step worksheet that will help you:

*  Identify Your Winner: A simple scoring system to match your skills, interests, and budget with the ideal income model in less than 10 minutes.

Here’s what happens next: Enter your best email address, and I’ll immediately send you the checklist. I’ll also send you the rest of this guide—“The Passive Income Deep Dive”—in a series of emails, breaking down all six modern models in detail so you can explore each model without feeling overwhelmed.

Watch for the first email, titled “The Passive Income Deep Dive, Part 1: Affiliate Marketing.“

This is the exact process I used to find my focus and build my own online income. It’s my gift to you, to help you get started on the right foot.

# Let’s Explore the Six Modern Passive Income Models

In my “Passive Income Deep Dive” email series, we’ll break down each of these models in detail, with real-world examples and step-by-step instructions for getting started.

1. Affiliate Marketing: Discover how to recommend other companies’ products and earn a commission for every sale you generate—without ever handling inventory.
2. Advertising Revenue: Learn how to build a website or channel that attracts enough traffic to earn from ads (like Google AdSense). It’s like owning a digital billboard.
3. Sales & E-commerce: Master selling products online, from classic dropshipping to creating and selling your own digital products.
4. Subscription & Recurring Revenue: From software (SaaS) to exclusive membership sites, see how to build a predictable, repeating income stream that grows over time.
5. Lead Generation: Get paid for connecting businesses with potential customers. We’ll cover building lists, newsletters, and the systems that make it work.
6. The AI-Powered Model (New!): Explore the frontier of online income: creating and monetizing AI tools, building businesses powered by AI, and leveraging automation in new ways.

# The Foundation: Your Mindset & The Real Deal on Time & Money

Before we dive into the models, let’s get real about what it takes. Building a lasting online income isn’t about magic buttons or secret hacks. It’s about building a real business, and that requires two key investments:

1. The Right Mindset: This is Your Most Important Tool  
Success starts between your ears. You need to shift from a “get-rich-quick” consumer to a “build-something-great” creator. This means embracing patience, consistency, and a willingness to learn. The freedom on the other side is worth the discipline.

2. The Investment: Time, Money, or Both  
The old saying is true: “You get out what you put in.”

* The Time Path: If you’re on a tight budget, you can invest your time. This means following lessons, doing the research, and executing each step yourself. It’s slower, but entirely possible.
* The Money Path: If you have some capital, you can invest in tools, courses, or hiring help to speed up the process.
* The Best Path: Most successful people invest a combination of both.

# The Essential Toolkit: What You’ll Need to Get Started

You don’t need a warehouse full of equipment, but you do need the right digital tools. Think of this as your starter pack for building a professional online business.

The Non-Negotiable Basics:

* A Reliable Computer & Internet: This is your workspace. You don’t need the latest model, but you need something that won’t crash constantly.
* A Dedicated Workspace: A small desk where you can focus, even if it’s just a corner of a room.

Your Core Digital Assets:  
These are the foundational pieces of your online business real estate. You’ll learn exactly how to set these up in the deep dive.

* A Domain Name: Your custom address on the web (e.g., YourBusinessName.com).
* Web Hosting: The land where your website lives. I recommend starting with a provider known for great support.
* A Website Platform: WordPress is the industry standard for flexibility and control. It’s what I use and teach.

Your Key Software Tools:  
You don’t need to buy all of these at once, but you should be aware of the categories:

* Keyword Research Tool: To discover what your future customers are searching for.
* Email Marketing Service: To build a list and communicate with your audience (this is how you build a true asset).
* A Project Management Mindset: Use a simple notebook, a free app like Trello, or a timer to plan your work and stay focused.

A Word on Cost: You can start for less than the cost of a few coffees per month. The key is to invest in the basics first, then scale up as your business grows.

# Your Journey to Financial Freedom Starts With a Single Step

You’ve just seen the big picture. You now understand the six modern models for generating income online, the mindset required to succeed, and the essential tools you’ll need. This isn’t just theory—it’s a proven framework.

The hardest part for most people isn’t the work; it’s making that first, clear decision and knowing exactly which step to take first.

That’s why I created the “Passive Income Model Selector” Checklist. It turns the overwhelming “what should I do?” into a simple, step-by-step plan.

I’d like to share my story and hopefully understand it better from an Indonesian or Jakarta perspective.

I’m a 34-year-old Muslim guy living in Australia, originally from Pakistan. About two years ago, I met a girl from Jakarta on the Muzz app. We started talking casually but slowly got close — long calls, daily chats, and emotional connection.

After about six months things slowed down, but we reconnected again and became more serious. She asked me to come to Jakarta to “show action.” I wanted to, but I hesitated at first because I’d never been to Indonesia and didn’t know anyone there. I tried to plan a trip during Christmas but couldn’t manage it, so I showed affection by sending her food, gifts, and online surprises.

In April, I had a trip to Thailand and asked if she could meet me there. I offered to pay her flight and separate accommodation, but she said no. During that trip, I spent most of my time just talking to her online — I really valued the relationship.

Sometimes she said she wanted to break up because I hadn’t visited yet, but I convinced her to stay. She always said, “Come in December for a long trip, not earlier.”

Then, in August, our connection became stronger — more calls, more personal stories, and she shared about her family and her siblings’ weddings. Everything felt good. But from the 1st of September, she suddenly started ignoring me. Two days later, she texted saying our “values don’t match” and that she wanted to break up.

I was shocked. We had just been close weeks before. I reminded her I planned to visit Jakarta in December or earlier if she wanted. She said December was fine. Then she became distant again. On 10th September we talked normally on the phone, but the next day she ignored me again.

When I asked if she was talking to someone else, she admitted she now had a boyfriend. I couldn’t believe it — two weeks earlier we were still close. I was heartbroken and immediately booked tickets to Indonesia because I couldn’t accept losing her like that.

When I told her, she said, “Do not come.” I thought she was angry, but she insisted again — even saying she’d pay for the tickets if I canceled. She became rude and cold, saying, “I broke up with you, I have a boyfriend now.”

I said I would just come to Bali instead and we could stay friends. She agreed, then the next day said, “If you want to come to Jakarta, you can come as a friend.”

When I arrived in Bali, my only reason to come to Jakarta was to see her. From the airport I called and asked if I could come right away — she said, “Come tomorrow.” So I booked a flight for the next day.

I reached Jakarta and we met. We had dinner and coffee; I brought her some gifts. The next day we met again. On the third day, she said she had a family function. I stayed in my hotel waiting for her replies — sometimes she replied after hours. Then she said she couldn’t meet Monday because of work and maybe Tuesday. On Tuesday, she first said she’d meet after work, then texted that she wasn’t feeling well.

On Wednesday, she finally said, “Let’s meet at 12.” I asked where, but she didn’t reply until 1 pm, asking where she should meet. She called me to a mall near her house, far from my hotel. I went there, we talked a bit, and when I tried to touch her hand, she pulled away. Then she said she was going to pray and texted me that she was going home. She never came back.

After all of this — two years of emotional connection, daily talks, and effort — I’m left broken and confused.

I’m not here to insult or blame anyone. I just want to understand from locals or anyone familiar with Indonesian culture:

* Why would someone behave this way after such a long emotional connection?
* Was she just being polite meeting me as closure, or was she manipulating the situation?
* Is it cultural in Jakarta to cut off relationships once someone new is involved, even if there’s still emotional history?
* Or was I simply too late and she had already moved on?

Any honest thoughts from Jakarta locals (men or women) would really help me understand what might have been in her mind and how people generally handle such situations there.

The worst part? It went straight into the earphone speaker grille.

In my panic mode, I immediately rinsed it under the sink (I know, I know) and dried it thoroughly. Now I'm sitting here wondering if I just made things worse.

Has anyone else done something this dumb? Did the water rinse actually help or just push moisture deeper? Should I expect speaker issues or worse internal damage down the line?

I used to binge a lot, so understandably when I started using wegovy, I’d overeat, get nauseous, vomit & learn my body’s limits.

BUT ITS BEEN 8 MONTHS. I know my body’s limits now! I learned the portions my body could handle. I learned to avoid red meat & eat it in small quantities. I learned the affects greasy foods have on my body. I learned which foods ease my digestion! I got this shit DOWN by now. For 6 months I almost never had nausea or vomiting.

However last month due to personal issues I missed ONE DOSE OF WEGOVY. As in I took it 5 days later (2.4 mgs), but I fell back to my regular, once-a-week injections since then.

But the nausea came back hard. It doesn’t even matter what I eat, what quantities. There isn’t a clear pattern. A specific food that triggers it or large portions. I just randomly get nauseous, sulfur burps and stomach pains & im forced to sit around for hours with a bucket next to me just waiting to vomit. AND THE WORST THING? Back when I started taking wegovy & id get nauseous, I’d throw up once, empty my stomach & it would be over. NOWADAYS when I get nauseous I could stay up all night, vomiting 3-4 times and not knowing when it would end.

I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO! It’s unbearable and it wastes entire days of my life. I tried to talk to my doctor and she says “she doesn’t believe wegovy is the cause” because I’m “losing weight so well!”. IM SICK OF IT!

Worse of all? I go entire days constipated, no matter how much fiber, olive oil or coffee I drink, and for DAYS I can feel food accumulating every time I eat, I feel myself getting full until the nausea comes but like wtf am I supposed to do? Starve myself?

I will never induce vomiting because I really really don’t wanna fall into bulimia or any kind of disordered eating, but at this point I feel like it’s either that or waiting for the vomit to come naturally, which could take hours, wasting entire days of my life.

He didn’t really see them for the first 6 months but now he is meeting them more. It started with coffees and gym sessions and then changed to drinks and going to their birthday nights out being the only guy there. 

They’re not long term friends, he’s either met them online through shared interests or at events and hit it off.

Examples are one woman who’s birthday night out he went to, was an online/phone call friend for a year and that was the first time they met. Another he met twice before me and him got together and he’s met up with 3 times recently. Gym session, then a coffee and then for drinks. She came on to him during the drinks and he shut her down and ended the friendship but I feel a bit disrespected that he is putting me in situations where women feel comfortable to come on to him in the first place. He always says he wants me to meet his friends but he never arranges anything. 

He barely sees his male friends. I’ve met two of them briefly though. We live a few hours apart so admittedly it’s difficult to arrange stuff.

1o6cz89,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1o6cz89/discover_if_horsepower_carpet_spot_cleaner_really/,Discover If Horsepower Carpet Spot Cleaner Really Lifts Stains Fast,"The Horsepower 18223 Bull Shot Carpet Spot Cleaner sounded like a bold promise when I first read about it. A stain remover that handles everything from pet stains to coffee spills? Pretty ambitious. Honestly, I thought it might just join the ranks of other overhyped cleaning products, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt. After all, who doesn’t dream of a spotless carpet with minimal effort?

**Ease of Use Brings Joy**  
One of my favorite things about this product is its simplicity. There’s no mixing or prepping. You literally point, spray, and walk away. The foam action is definitely fun to watch—kind of like letting science do the heavy lifting. It almost feels like magic when you’re dealing with smaller stains. Coffee rings and wine spills disappear with surprising ease. I couldn’t resist spraying it on random marks, just to test its efficiency.

[Check Horsepower 18223 Bull Shot Carpet Spot Cleaner price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b0f7qjbl4s/)  

**Power Against Pesky Stains**  
The advanced stain-lifting foam is no joke. What amazed me was how deeply it absorbed into carpets and fabrics, breaking down tough stains like lipstick and kitchen grease with minimal scrubbing on my part. The product handled even older stains left behind by my cat’s not-so-charming “accidents.” While a rag or brush was needed for those trickier spots, it wasn’t overwhelming. Frankly, the versatility impressed me—I even tested it on a chair cushion that had seen better days, and it looked brand new after two sprays.  

**Perks**  
- Extremely simple to use—point and spray, and stains start vanishing.  
- Works beautifully on fresh stains, particularly coffee, wine, and soda spills.  
- Advanced foam formula digs deep into fabrics without damaging them.  
- Handles various stains, from pet mishaps to mysterious blotches no one in the house will admit to creating.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- For older or tougher stains, you might need to repeat the process or scrub lightly.  
- It’s not completely odor-free—the scent, while not overpowering, may not be to everyone’s taste.  
- Packaging could definitely use some work—it feels like it could tip over easily if you’ve got kids around.  

**Other Options to Consider**  
Compared to other spot cleaners like Resolve Carpet Cleaner, this product offers a unique blend of stain-fighting foam that works quickly. Resolve often requires more manual scrubbing and sometimes leaves a sticky residue behind. Meanwhile, products like Nature’s Miracle, often preferred for pet stains, have comparable power but lack the versatility for more general household stains like coffee or wine. That said, the Horsepower 18223 Bull Shot really shines in how it combines ease of use and versatility into one solution. While Resolve feels like a great option for broad cleaning, this foam gets targeted results faster and with less fuss.

**Affordable Quality?**  
Looking at the results and how much surface area one can covers per bottle, the product strikes a good balance between cost and quality. Many budget-friendly cleaners on the market require several reapplications or leave residues that damage carpets over time. This cleaner, with its rapid-acting foam and deep-cleaning properties, justifies its value. If it saves a trip to the dry cleaner or prevents permanent stains, it’s worth every penny in my book.

I need to put this somewhere, because my own silence is deafening. 

Today, I had a work meeting at one of those sleek, glass-walled cafes on 12th Main in Indiranagar. The kind where the coffee costs more than a day’s wage for the man cleaning the street outside. I was with a woman acquaintance you can call her ig (know her from work) who is, by all accounts, a champion of her cause. Sharp, successful, sheisc very vocal about the challenges women face, about ""breaking glass ceilings” and “shattering patriarchy"" etc. 

We walked together for a bit afterward, our destinations in the same direction. As we passed a sanitation worker, a man crouched low over a gutter, his hands deep in the filth that keeps the city moving, she instinctively recoiled. She wrinkled her nose, not just in disgust at the smell, but at him.

“Ewww, c*****r,” (a caste-based name for leatherworkers) she said almost with a casual, almost bored and instinctive cruelty. 

The world stopped for a second. I hated how it felt. There was only the weight of that word, the sight of the man who didn't even look up, and my own feet, still moving forward. I didn’t say a word. I just nodded, pretending I hadn't heard, and a few moments later we parted ways.

Now, hours later, I’m replaying that moment, and my blood is boiling - mostly at myself. I’m drowning in questions that feel impossible to answer, and I’m hoping someone here can help me make sense of this.

How can we talk about solidarity when the ground we stand on is so fundamentally unequal? 

This is the question that’s tearing me apart. She fights a real battle against patriarchy. Yes. She faces sexism, her ambitions are questioned in ways mine never will be. I believe in her struggle. But how can I reconcile her fight for “equality” with the casual dehumanization of a man whose reality she cannot even begin to imagine?

We often hear this idea that “the status of a high-privilege woman and a poor, low-class man are the same.” But are they? Her struggle is for a seat at the table. His struggle is for the right to be seen as human while cleaning the floor under that same table. She faces a glass ceiling. He faces a concrete one, reinforced with centuries of caste apartheid.

To my mind, pretending their struggles are identical isn’t solidarity. It almost feels like a profound erasure of his specific, brutal reality. How do we build a bridge between these two experiences without lying about the chasm that separates them?
What is feminism if it has a caste-shaped blind spot? 

Her feminism gives her the language and the community to fight back against that violation. But she felt nothing - not even a flicker of cognitive dissonance - while using a slur that is the verbal equivalent of a physical assault for millions.

It makes me wonder: Is some of our modern feminism just a tool for privileged women to get a bigger piece of the oppressive pie? 

Does it only challenge the patriarchy that affects them, while leaving the foundational pillars of caste and class untouched because, ultimately, they benefit from them? If feminism allows you to fight for your bodily autonomy while denying his basic humanity, is it feminism at all? Or is it just privilege in a new gown?

What is a man’s role in this? Why was I so paralyzed? This is the hardest part to admit. I stayed silent. Part of me was shocked. But another part - a deeper, more cowardly part - was afraid. Afraid of the confrontation. Afraid of being told one of several retorts: “You’re a man, what would you know?” OR “This isn’t your fight. Stop trying to police women.” OR “You’re derailing the conversation from the real issues.” These are all responses I have heard in different situations everytime I've tried to rebutt this. 

I was trapped. By speaking up, I risked being framed as a man attacking a woman, undermining the ""sisterhood."" By staying silent, I became complicit in caste violence. The system creates this false choice, and in that moment, I failed the test. I chose the path of least resistance, the path that protected my comfort and upheld the violent status quo.

So, I’m asking for suggestions. Truly. 

My silence today was a failure. It was the silence that allows this casual cruelty to fester. I don’t want to be that person again.
So I’m asking you, especially women who navigate these complex spaces every day:
In that exact moment, what could I have said or done? How do you call out casteism from someone who sees herself as part of an oppressed group, without letting them weaponize their gender to deflect? What are the words? Do you say, ""Do you realize what that word means?"" Do you stop and ask her to look at him as a person? What is a constructive, non-performative response? 

More importantly, how should men, as allies, navigate these intersections? How do we support the fight against patriarchy while also holding the movement accountable for its casteism and classism? How do we use our privilege to disrupt, without recentering the conversation on ourselves?

How would you have handled it? If you were me, a man walking beside her? I will claim that if you were another woman walking with her, it would perhaps be easier? What would you have done to break that horrifying silence?

My blood boiled, but my mouth stayed shut. And a man’s humanity was treated like garbage on the street we were so privileged to walk on. I want to do better. Please tell me how.",0,1760441390.0,AskIndianWomen,17,0.48,False

1o6cx5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1o6cx5i/need_honest_advice_from_jakarta_locals_why_did_my/,Need honest advice from Jakarta locals — why did my online girlfriend treat me like this after 2 years?,"Hi everyone,

I’d like to share my story and hopefully understand it better from LDR perspective.

I’m a 34-year-old Muslim guy living in Australia, originally from Pakistan. About two years ago, I met a girl from Jakarta on the Muzz app. We started talking casually but slowly got close — long calls, daily chats, and emotional connection.

After about six months things slowed down, but we reconnected again and became more serious. She asked me to come to Jakarta to “show action.” I wanted to, but I hesitated at first because I’d never been to Indonesia and didn’t know anyone there. I tried to plan a trip during Christmas but couldn’t manage it, so I showed affection by sending her food, gifts, and online surprises.

In April, I had a trip to Thailand and asked if she could meet me there. I offered to pay her flight and separate accommodation, but she said no. During that trip, I spent most of my time just talking to her online — I really valued the relationship.

Sometimes she said she wanted to break up because I hadn’t visited yet, but I convinced her to stay. She always said, “Come in December for a long trip, not earlier.”

Then, in August, our connection became stronger — more calls, more personal stories, and she shared about her family and her siblings’ weddings. Everything felt good. But from the 1st of September, she suddenly started ignoring me. Two days later, she texted saying our “values don’t match” and that she wanted to break up.

I was shocked. We had just been close weeks before. I reminded her I planned to visit Jakarta in December or earlier if she wanted. She said December was fine. Then she became distant again. On 10th September we talked normally on the phone, but the next day she ignored me again.

When I asked if she was talking to someone else, she admitted she now had a boyfriend. I couldn’t believe it — two weeks earlier we were still close. I was heartbroken and immediately booked tickets to Indonesia because I couldn’t accept losing her like that.

When I told her, she said, “Do not come.” I thought she was angry, but she insisted again — even saying she’d pay for the tickets if I canceled. She became rude and cold, saying, “I broke up with you, I have a boyfriend now.”

I said I would just come to Bali instead and we could stay friends. She agreed, then the next day said, “If you want to come to Jakarta, you can come as a friend.”

When I arrived in Bali, my only reason to come to Jakarta was to see her. From the airport I called and asked if I could come right away — she said, “Come tomorrow.” So I booked a flight for the next day.

I reached Jakarta and we met. We had dinner and coffee; I brought her some gifts. The next day we met again. On the third day, she said she had a family function. I stayed in my hotel waiting for her replies — sometimes she replied after hours. Then she said she couldn’t meet Monday because of work and maybe Tuesday. On Tuesday, she first said she’d meet after work, then texted that she wasn’t feeling well.

On Wednesday, she finally said, “Let’s meet at 12.” I asked where, but she didn’t reply until 1 pm, asking where she should meet. She called me to a mall near her house, far from my hotel. I went there, we talked a bit, and when I tried to touch her hand, she pulled away. Then she said she was going to pray and texted me that she was going home. She never came back.

After all of this — two years of emotional connection, daily talks, and effort — I’m left broken and confused.

I’m not here to insult or blame anyone. I just want to understand from locals or anyone familiar with Indonesian culture:

* Why would someone behave this way after such a long emotional connection?
* Was she just being polite meeting me as closure, or was she manipulating the situation?
* Is it cultural in Jakarta to cut off relationships once someone new is involved, even if there’s still emotional history?
* Or was I simply too late and she had already moved on?

Any honest thoughts from Jakarta locals (men or women) would really help me understand what might have been in her mind and how people generally handle such situations there.

1o6cwme,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1o6cwme/how_do_i_deal_with_a_creepy_middle_aged_divorced/,How do I deal with a creepy middle aged divorced coworker?,"Hi guys, I need help with a small situation I’m having at work. Here’s a bit more context (I’m sorry in advance for the long text):

I’m a working student, F21, and started working at a new place about 2 months back. I’m being trained to take on a full time role after my studies. It’s a bigger company, but the office I work at is part of a smaller project. The team and work is super fun, except for this one dude. 

I came into the office once when it was almost empty, besides me and the creepy dude, I’ll call him Mark, there’s one more coworker there. Mark is about 40 I think and he and I have nothing to do with each other professionally. Anyways, I was working in a corner by myself and Mark comes over and introduces himself. I was kind and polite, but then he basically told me that he’s been watching me for a while and thought about talking to me (I’m paraphrasing). I thought it was strange but hey, sometimes people say strange things. We go bad to work. 

Around lunch time, I go get a coffee, all of a sudden Mark spawns next to me and asks if I’m going to the Cafeteria for lunch. Apparently the other coworker has left already so I said “sure we can go”. I didn’t say it enthusiastically or anything, I was being polite but probably should have said no, as I was getting slightly suspicious of him. Oh well, in hindsight these things seem clearer.
We go to lunch, we talk and he seems nice but nervous, but I ease up a little bit. We have a bit in common, I begin talking to him like I do with friends I’m getting to know. I then talk about my boyfriend who lives in another city, and Mark tells me he got married in that city. I’m relieved, thinking I probably got suspicious of his behavior for nothing. Then he tells me he got divorced after seven years. And then proceeds to throw in that he’s divorced a couple more times randomly in the conversation. I can only think of saying “better luck next time” 😭.

We go back to the office and use the elevator. My key card does not grant me access to the elevator but his does. We talk about it a bit and joke, but as we’re walking I can tell he keeps walking behind me and I feel him stare at my butt, so I keep walking slower again to stand next to him. We finally reach the office and go back to work.

About two minutes later I get a chat message from him (on the company platform) saying he took a look at my keycard and get it arranged so that I have access, since he knows who’s responsible. I thank him. The he continues making conversation in the chat, texting me while we’re sitting in the same office. I message back at first (muscle memory I guess) like I do with a friend, but polite, then realize at some point I need to cut my answers shorter because he doesn’t end the conversation. At some point I just stop opening his messages all together. He then double messages me with something else 20 minutes later, I ignore it again. By now, I’m uncomfortable. Trying to be polite isn’t working and I feel like I maybe did something wrong being so nice to him at the beginning. I feel a bit guilty cause what if I led him on? So I continue ignoring him. He messages a third time, asking when I’ll go home, saying we could ride the elevator together. I tell him I don’t know and thanks but I’ll use the stairs. A few minutes go by and I hear by chance that the third colleague is leaving. Not wanting to be alone with Mark I pack up my stuff so quickly and bolt out of there.

The next week, the office is full again. I’m surrounded by other working colleagues. Mark messages me around noon, referencing something we had talked about at lunch. I don’t open the message. He’s got a friend at work who seems like the guy stuck in his middle school brain despite being 50. I see this friend poke his head around the corner and just look around, but I have a feeling he is checking if I’m there. Then a few minutes later, Mark looks around the corner and obviously just checks himself if I’m there. I’m creeped out. Anyways, this was my last day of work in the office before vacation, and my coworkers slowly start leaving one after the other. I still have work to finish so I stay later. Almost like clockwork, the second the last of my team members leaves, Mark comes to my desk and tries to chat with me. As if he’s been waiting all day for us two to be alone in the office. I try to draw a harsher line this time and barely look up from my desk, just talking in short answers and not making much conversation. He tries for a few minutes then gets the hint and leaves. I thought this would be the end of it, but today, the first day back from vacation, he messages me again. I love coming to the office but him being there makes me uncomfortable, I don’t know how to handle it. 

I know I maybe should have acted differently, but I think I’m too nice and polite sometimes. This is also my first time dealing with a creepy man who’s this persistent, I know it’s not a huge deal yet but I don’t want it to be. My boyfriend tells me I should talk to a coworker or my boss about this but I wouldn’t even know what to say, as he by definition hasn’t done anything wrong. He’s being creepy but there isn’t anything I can point to that would be a solid base for action I think. Also, I don’t know if I’m being careful or a coward, but I’m afraid of the consequences that speaking up to someone else would have, especially if I have no concrete evidence. I’m scared that they would be suspicious of me or think I’m overreacting. I told my boyfriend it’s probably best I confront him myself, tell him straight up to stop messaging me if it’s not work related, on the company messaging platform so I have proof in case he continues to message me. Or maybe I should tell him directly that a middle aged divorced dude shouldn’t speak so persistently to a young student and making conversation. Like I said, it’s my first time dealing with this. What should I do? Thank you guys in advance!

However, two of my family members have complained to me that they hated the wedding, specifically the catering. One of them complained because one of the sushi rolls ran out when she went for seconds (there were others available). The other one went as far as to say that it was the worst wedding she had ever attended. She complained that the buffet lines were too long (we had 4 buffet stations with various cuisines served by chefs on small plates), that one of the vegetables was undercooked, that the portions were too small, and that we didn’t have coffee and tea service. 

Of course after hearing this, I started asking others close to me what their thoughts were. People said the food was delicious but that they were also a bit annoyed by the lines and the fact that it wasn’t plated. Our thought was to prioritize the quality of the food, but clearly that seems to have backfired on us.

Hi everyone,

I’d like to share my story and hopefully understand it better from an Indonesian or Jakarta perspective.

I’d like to share my story and hopefully understand it better from an Indonesian or Jakarta perspective.

I’m a 34-year-old Muslim guy living in Australia, originally from Pakistan. About two years ago, I met a girl from Jakarta on the Muzz app. We started talking casually but slowly got close — long calls, daily chats, and emotional connection.

After about six months things slowed down, but we reconnected again and became more serious. She asked me to come to Jakarta to “show action.” I wanted to, but I hesitated at first because I’d never been to Indonesia and didn’t know anyone there. I tried to plan a trip during Christmas but couldn’t manage it, so I showed affection by sending her food, gifts, and online surprises.

In April, I had a trip to Thailand and asked if she could meet me there. I offered to pay her flight and separate accommodation, but she said no. During that trip, I spent most of my time just talking to her online — I really valued the relationship.

Sometimes she said she wanted to break up because I hadn’t visited yet, but I convinced her to stay. She always said, “Come in December for a long trip, not earlier.”

Then, in August, our connection became stronger — more calls, more personal stories, and she shared about her family and her siblings’ weddings. Everything felt good. But from the 1st of September, she suddenly started ignoring me. Two days later, she texted saying our “values don’t match” and that she wanted to break up.

I was shocked. We had just been close weeks before. I reminded her I planned to visit Jakarta in December or earlier if she wanted. She said December was fine. Then she became distant again. On 10th September we talked normally on the phone, but the next day she ignored me again.

When I asked if she was talking to someone else, she admitted she now had a boyfriend. I couldn’t believe it — two weeks earlier we were still close. I was heartbroken and immediately booked tickets to Indonesia because I couldn’t accept losing her like that.

When I told her, she said, “Do not come.” I thought she was angry, but she insisted again — even saying she’d pay for the tickets if I canceled. She became rude and cold, saying, “I broke up with you, I have a boyfriend now.”

I said I would just come to Bali instead and we could stay friends. She agreed, then the next day said, “If you want to come to Jakarta, you can come as a friend.”

When I arrived in Bali, my only reason to come to Jakarta was to see her. From the airport I called and asked if I could come right away — she said, “Come tomorrow.” So I booked a flight for the next day.

I reached Jakarta and we met. We had dinner and coffee; I brought her some gifts. The next day we met again. On the third day, she said she had a family function. I stayed in my hotel waiting for her replies — sometimes she replied after hours. Then she said she couldn’t meet Monday because of work and maybe Tuesday. On Tuesday, she first said she’d meet after work, then texted that she wasn’t feeling well.

On Wednesday, she finally said, “Let’s meet at 12.” I asked where, but she didn’t reply until 1 pm, asking where she should meet. She called me to a mall near her house, far from my hotel. I went there, we talked a bit, and when I tried to touch her hand, she pulled away. Then she said she was going to pray and texted me that she was going home. She never came back.

After all of this — two years of emotional connection, daily talks, and effort — I’m left broken and confused.

I’m not here to insult or blame anyone. I just want to understand from locals or anyone familiar with Indonesian culture:

* Why would someone behave this way after such a long emotional connection?
* Was she just being polite meeting me as closure, or was she manipulating the situation?
* Is it cultural in Jakarta to cut off relationships once someone new is involved, even if there’s still emotional history?
* Or was I simply too late and she had already moved on?

Any honest thoughts from Jakarta locals (men or women) would really help me understand what might have been in her mind and how people generally handle such situations there.

1o6cit3,https://www.reddit.com/r/udhav_khera/comments/1o6cit3/mastering_c_thread_class_multithreading_made/,Mastering C# Thread Class – Multithreading Made Simple,"If you’ve ever seen your app freeze while doing some heavy work (like downloading files or processing data), this post is for you. The secret to fixing that lag lies in the C# Thread class — a simple but powerful tool that helps your program do many things at once.

This post is inspired by **Tpoint Tech**, who explain C# stuff in a super chill and beginner-friendly way, so don’t worry — no complicated code here 

# So, What’s a Thread Anyway?

Imagine your computer program as a kitchen.  
You’ve got one cook (the main program) who has to do everything — chopping veggies, boiling pasta, washing dishes. That’s slow, right?

Now imagine adding more cooks — one chops, one boils, one washes. Suddenly, the work gets done faster. Each cook is like a **thread**.

That’s what **multithreading** means: your program can handle several tasks at the same time instead of waiting for one to finish before starting the next.

The [**C# Thread class**](https://www.tpointtech.com/c-sharp-thread-class) is what lets you create and manage those “cooks.” It helps you start, pause, and stop different tasks running side by side inside your app.

# What Is the C# Thread Class?

The **C# Thread class** is part of something called `System.Threading` in C#. Think of it as the control center for multitasking.

Using threads, your app can:

* Download files while updating the progress bar
* Load data in the background while the user keeps working
* Handle multiple tasks at once without slowing down

Basically, it keeps your program responsive and smooth.

**Tpoint Tech** often says this is one of those concepts that makes your apps feel *professional*. Once you understand threads, your programs won’t lag or “freeze” anymore when doing big tasks.

# Why Multithreading Matters

Let’s be real — users hate waiting.  
If your app freezes when doing heavy work, people will close it faster than you can say “C#.”

Here’s why multithreading matters:

* Your app feels faster and more responsive
* You can do multiple things in the background
* You can make better use of your computer’s CPU
* You can handle more users or data at once

So yeah, learning the **C# Thread class** is like learning how to multitask efficiently — for your app, not just yourself 

# How It Works (Without the Complicated Stuff)

Let’s keep this simple:

Normally, a program does things one by one — step by step.  
With threads, you can tell your program, “Hey, do this *while* doing that.”

The **C# Thread class** helps you control that.  
You can:

* Start new threads (to run tasks)
* Pause them
* Wait for them to finish
* Or even stop them if needed

It’s kind of like running multiple playlists at once — one playing music, one downloading songs, and one showing lyrics.

You don’t need to know every tiny technical detail right now. Just remember that **threads make your app faster and smoother by splitting the work**.

# Benefits of the C# Thread Class

The folks at **Tpoint Tech** always highlight how useful the **C# Thread class** can be:

1. **Speed Boost** – Do more in less time.
2. **Smooth Experience** – No more “Not Responding” screens.
3. **Better Hardware Use** – Your CPU works smarter, not harder.
4. **Scalable Apps** – Perfect for apps handling many users or background tasks.
5. **Full Control** – You decide what runs, when, and how.

Basically, threads are the secret sauce behind modern, high-performance apps.

# Where You’ll Use Threads in Real Life

You might not realize it, but threads are used everywhere:

* **Games:** Handling movement, sound, and graphics separately.
* **Finance Apps:** Fetching live data while showing charts.
* **Web Servers:** Managing hundreds of users at once.
* **Desktop Apps:** Loading data in the background while letting users click around.

If your app does more than one thing, you’ll probably need threads at some point. And that’s where the **C# Thread class** comes in handy.

# Things to Watch Out For

Okay, threads are awesome, but they can also get messy if not handled carefully.

Here’s what **Tpoint Tech** always reminds new devs about:

* **Race conditions:** When two threads try to change the same data at the same time.
* **Deadlocks:** When two threads wait on each other forever.
* **Too many threads:** More isn’t always better — too many can slow things down.

So, start small. Learn how threads work one step at a time before diving into complex stuff.

# Pro Tips from Tpoint Tech

Here are a few simple tips from **Tpoint Tech** that Reddit devs love:

* Keep things simple — don’t overuse threads.
* Always clean up your threads when you’re done.
* Make sure threads don’t block the user interface.
* Plan your thread logic before adding it.

Remember: the goal isn’t to create *more* threads, but to make your program *smarter* about how it uses them.

# Final Thoughts

So yeah — that’s the **C# Thread class** in a nutshell. It’s what makes your app multitask like a pro. You don’t have to be a senior developer to use it — just understand the basics and you’ll already be ahead of most beginners.

The best part? Once you start using threads the right way, your app instantly feels faster, more stable, and way more fun to use.

As people on Reddit often say, once you “get” threads, programming just clicks differently.

1o6cgjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/bollywood/comments/1o6cgjf/do_you_think_bollywood_needs_to_do_some_good/,Do you think Bollywood needs to do some good marketing?,"I'm a huge fan of Hindi cinema—Bollywood has given us timeless magic, even if the craft feels diluted these days with formulaic tropes and fleeting trends. Yet, my love for it remains unwavering, rooted in those epic sagas, soul-stirring melodies, and visual poetry that once defined the industry.

What I crave most is a revival in marketing that's authentic and immersive, not just a glossy PR spectacle. Today, promotions revolve around star-studded events, memes, and viral hooks, but rarely delve into the film's essence—the script's depth, a song's melody, the cinematography's framing, or the editing's rhythm. Remember the golden era when channels like SET Max released exclusive behind-the-scenes snippets, extended song cuts, or making-of featurettes? Those raw glimpses built anticipation and loyalty. Bring that back—let the art speak for itself.

Storytelling in promotions is vanishing, and that's a missed opportunity. Imagine filmmakers sharing the genesis of a script: How did the idea spark during a late-night coffee or a real-life encounter? What research fueled it, and what hurdles—like budget constraints or location woes—did they conquer? Dedicate video series to this craft breakdown. Picture music directors like A.R. Rahman (whose recent revelation about ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" moved me deeply) recounting the director's brief, the lyricist's poetic sparks, collaborative jam sessions, and auditions where voices were tested until the perfect one emerged. Choreographers could unveil their vision boards—how a dance sequence evolved from mood boards to rehearsals, blending tradition with innovation. Directors might dissect shot compositions: Why that golden-hour lighting for an emotional climax, or how VFX bridged impossible worlds?

Bollywood stars jet to exotic locales for promotions, yet these trips often feel superficial—photo-ops and fan meets without substance. Why not transform them into storytelling hubs? Host intimate sessions where crews narrate these journeys on-site, perhaps at a film's shooting spot, inviting fans to connect with the process. People crave this insider magic; it humanizes the glamour and ignites curiosity. A.R. Rahman's tale of divine inspiration for ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja""—born not for *Jodhaa Akbar* but from a spiritual pilgrimage—touched my heart precisely because it revealed the soul behind the sound.

Trust me, this shift wouldn't just boost box office numbers by fostering genuine buzz; it'd spotlight unsung heroes—composers, lyricists, cinematographers, and more—elevating them to stardom. Audiences would invest emotionally, rediscovering Bollywood's collaborative heartbeat, and the industry would thrive on creativity, not just commerce. Let's reclaim that narrative charm; it's time Bollywood told its own epic backstory. What do you think—ready for this renaissance?

He calls her his dove; she aches for his voice at night. But it’s not all soft lighting and roses. The watchmen rough her up, she looks for him and he’s gone, that gut-punch “where are you?” right in the middle of the passion. It’s not polished romance; it’s the push and pull of intimacy, electric one moment, empty the next.

Lately, I can’t stop thinking about my own marriage. Five years in, bot church kids. We swore God would be our glue and figured that meant we’d be fine. At first it was fire. We’d pray tangled up in bed at midnight, trade verses like inside jokes, fingertips brushing over the same page.

then life crept in. My job drains me dry, seven to collapse. Her freelance eats weekends. Our devotionals became forgotten sticky notes on the fridge. We’d hype a “Bible night,” but then one of us would be too tired, or the sink would clog, or some little thing would kill the moment.

Church still hits hard. “love your wife like Christ loved the church” feels like a brick on my chest. I stopped praying out loud because it elt stiff, scripted. The fights arn’t big, just low-grade hums that keep us apart: coffee left out, air conditioner too cold, emails, TikToks about marriages that look nothing like ours. The silence screams louder than shouting ever did

The bedroom’s the worst heartbreak. She says she’s exhausted, not in the mood, face blank, light dimming. Whdn she finally told me she feels unsexy and burned out, it shattered me. Now we live side by side, not face to face. Bills, laundry, checklists No late-night talks about God. No hands raised together in worship. Just two solo faiths under one roof.

It burns. I get angry at her distance; she gets angry that I don’t see her. Fridays turn into silent wars, Netflix versus forced date nights. We sit on opposite ends of the couch, hearts pounding but miles apart, like Solomon’s lovers wandering through the dark.

Sometimes I still text er a verse in the morning. She snds a heart. It feels empty. I whisper, “God, we need You,” over cold coffee. But maybe that’s the point. Were not meant to wander alone. Even Solomon’s story doesn’t end lost in the night; they find each other again. That’s what divine love does. It digs in when everything’s messy and hard.

So here I am, still fighting for us, one wobbly try at a time. You ever been there? That quiet heartbreak of drifting, where the bed’s cold even with someone next to you, faith feels cracked because your hearts are, and you’re just surviving together? What helped you pull back? A real conversation over coffee, forcing time no matter what, or maybe God throwing you a curveball you didn’t see cming drop it here. Let’s not ache alone n the shadows.

*P:S - sorry for the spelling mistakes, late at night & just wanted some advice...*

**EDIT:** We tried this app called [Couple Bible](https://apple.co/4nVrBkS) (there are others like Bible Chat, but this one just clicked for us). It’s honestly been a quiet miracle in the middle of all the noise. Now, instead of arguing or zoning out, we take five minutes at coffee to read a verse, talk about it, breathe. When we’re about to spiral, we pause and go back to that day’s reading  it disarms us. It’s not some grand fix, but it’s helping us remember why we chose each other in the first place. The warmth’s starting to return. If you’re hurting and don’t know where to begin, maybe start small. Five minutes. One verse.

Today is proudly sponsored by Arielle. She forwarded an Instagram reel that had me desperate to find out exactly where I could buy these gadgets, and I was even ready to pay extra for faster delivery.

Today, my desk toy nerds, we are featuring a set of remote-controlled, tiny construction vehicles.

Perfect for shipping sugar crystals from one side of your desk, straight into your coffee cup on the other.

After spending hours trying to find these mini vehicles of awesome online, I inevitably ended up on Temu.

Now, with Len’s Temu addiction, we know we couldn’t start ordering from there again, just in case we flare it up.

Luckily, the gentleman in the video sourced the exact units he bought, with USB-C charging and alloy parts for extra durability, and he sells them through his [very own store](https://kydschoice.com/products/microcrew%E2%84%A2-mini-rc-construction-series-pocket-dump-truck-excavator-forklift-set?variant=45634663612615).

The Dump Truck and the Excavator will set you back $36 (R630) each, while the Forklift costs $28 (R490).

You can buy all three at once, which is obviously the point here, and score a discount on your total purchase, which will cost around $80 (R1,400).

Of course, there will be shipping and import fees, but for an estimated R2,000, this is definitely a set of awesome desk toys that I’m sure any one of you nerds, including myself, would love to get as an early Christmas present.

I met this girl while on holiday five months ago and we really hit it off, slept together on holiday, then went on a date the next day. We share the same hobbies, music tastes, and have a playful, flirty dynamic that just clicked. We’ve been talking daily since then, but she lives about two and a half hours away, so seeing each other in person has been tricky. The last couple of months, we’ve started phoning regularly.

The dynamic has been really up and down for me. I often felt like I was putting in more effort — constantly trying to arrange plans, suggesting meetups, even travelling down — while she often responded with “maybe,” “depends,” or “I’ll see what I’m doing,” rarely following through or offering alternatives. We met once last month for a date; I slept with her and stayed at hers. There were times when she seemed really affectionate — late-night calls, sending TikToks and reels (mostly sexual jokes, or couple things, relationship things, date ideas), chatting, planning things — which made me feel she genuinely wanted something. But then she’d occasionally pull back, disappear, or act distant, leaving me confused and questioning where I stood.

This past weekend really made things click. I was in her city to see my friend and asked if we could meet for 20–30 minutes for coffee. She didn’t make the time, said she was too busy, and then blanked me the entire night which isn’t like her at all, but she’d been pulling away all week. It became clear to me that her mind was made up — it wasn’t about being busy. I realized I’d been feeling uncertain for months and probably should’ve walked away long ago. She ended things on Sunday, citing distance, busyness, and anxiety. For context, we met finally again in mid-September and agreed to be exclusive, had planned to meet last weekend (but I was ill so cancelled), and could’ve met this weekend. That’s more than some short-distance couples I know, so it felt like something else was going on.

Over the last couple of months, she acted like my “future girlfriend” — late night calls, chats, trip ideas — then suddenly backtracked, saying she didn’t want to lead me on. This decision came over the course of a week right after I cancelled, even though things had been the best they’d been between us the week leading up to it — flirty, jokey, planning me coming down. It didn’t add up, but I realized I was chasing someone who wasn’t fully truthful or making me a priority.

As i say she messaged me Sunday to say she doesn’t see this going long term, citing busyness and distance. She said she was just too busy to see me even when I was in her city so no way this can go on. I didn’t fully believe that, knowing she avoided me that weekend. If she wanted to see me she would, i asked for 20 mins. She added that her anxiety made her need to focus on herself. I didn’t reply yesterday. Our 140-day streak died and she turned her location off for me on Snapchat.

Part of me wants to reply one last time to explain how I felt over the last few months, that i know that isn’t the full reason, i know she avoided me, i feel very led on and played, but I’m torn — I don’t want to seem soppy or give her the final say in our dynamic, and I also know that sending something won’t change anything and might just make me feel worse waiting on a reply or not getting one. At least if i just ignore I feel like i’ve left with dignity (even after kind of begging to talk about things as opposed to ending it). I’m trying to figure out if silence is the better move, or if it’s worth saying my piece and closing things properly. Thoughts?

I met this girl while on holiday five months ago and we really hit it off, slept together on holiday, then went on a date the next day. We share the same hobbies, music tastes, and have a playful, flirty dynamic that just clicked. We’ve been talking daily since then, but she lives about two and a half hours away, so seeing each other in person has been tricky. The last couple of months, we’ve started phoning regularly.

The dynamic has been really up and down for me. I often felt like I was putting in more effort — constantly trying to arrange plans, suggesting meetups, even travelling down — while she often responded with “maybe,” “depends,” or “I’ll see what I’m doing,” rarely following through or offering alternatives. We met once last month for a date; I slept with her and stayed at hers. There were times when she seemed really affectionate — late-night calls, sending TikToks and reels (mostly sexual jokes, or couple things, relationship things, date ideas), chatting, planning things — which made me feel she genuinely wanted something. But then she’d occasionally pull back, disappear, or act distant, leaving me confused and questioning where I stood.

This past weekend really made things click. I was in her city to see my friend and asked if we could meet for 20–30 minutes for coffee. She didn’t make the time, said she was too busy, and then blanked me the entire night which isn’t like her at all, but she’d been pulling away all week. It became clear to me that her mind was made up — it wasn’t about being busy. I realized I’d been feeling uncertain for months and probably should’ve walked away long ago. She ended things on Sunday, citing distance, busyness, and anxiety. For context, we met finally again in mid-September and agreed to be exclusive, had planned to meet last weekend (but I was ill so cancelled), and could’ve met this weekend. That’s more than some short-distance couples I know, so it felt like something else was going on.

Over the last couple of months, she acted like my “future girlfriend” — late night calls, chats, trip ideas — then suddenly backtracked, saying she didn’t want to lead me on. This decision came over the course of a week right after I cancelled, even though things had been the best they’d been between us the week leading up to it — flirty, jokey, planning me coming down. It didn’t add up, but I realized I was chasing someone who wasn’t fully truthful or making me a priority.

As i say she messaged me Sunday to say she doesn’t see this going long term, citing busyness and distance. She said she was just too busy to see me even when I was in her city so no way this can go on. I didn’t fully believe that, knowing she avoided me that weekend. If she wanted to see me she would, i asked for 20 mins. She added that her anxiety made her need to focus on herself. I didn’t reply yesterday. Our 140-day streak died and she turned her location off for me on Snapchat.

Part of me wants to reply one last time to explain how I felt over the last few months, that i know that isn’t the full reason, i know she avoided me, i feel very led on and played, but I’m torn — I don’t want to seem soppy or give her the final say in our dynamic, and I also know that sending something won’t change anything and might just make me feel worse waiting on a reply or not getting one. At least if i just ignore I feel like i’ve left with dignity (even after kind of begging to talk about things as opposed to ending it). I’m trying to figure out if silence is the better move, or if it’s worth saying my piece and closing things properly. Thoughts?

Either way, I truly wish you find someone who’s right for you. My post will be quite long because I want to make everything clear before you decide to message me. Once again, thank you so much.

**I’m looking for a connection that grows genuinely over time from both sides.** ***Whether it turns into friendship or something more, I always value friendship first. because I believe real love comes from the time and effort we put into getting to know each other.

**- Age: 25 - 35**

**-** Single (of course)

\- I just hope that if we’re on the same page, you’re serious when messaging me. Being serious doesn’t mean boring - it just means genuinely wanting to get to know each other.

\- I hope you’ll be open with me, because that’s important for us to build a real connection, right? I don’t mean you have to open up too much the first time we talk, we can just take our time and slowly get more comfortable and open with each other.

\- I'm the kind of person who doesn’t ask a lot of questions, and my energy usually depends on the person I'm talking with. What I mean is, if you’re a quiet person, I’m really sorry I probably won’t be able to keep the conversation going. But if you’re talkative and like asking questions, I’ll match your energy and ask you right back.

\- I'm Vietnamese and also live in Vietnam, you can see lot of pictures that I took in Vietnam and also Vietnamese food. **Time zone doesn't matter. It depends on whether both of us want to spend time together or not.**

\- **Appearance:** 5'7 , chubby , glasses, brown eyes, black long curly hair (not natural), I don’t really judge whether I’m beautiful or not. I’m just a simple girl who doesn’t wear much makeup and prefers a modest, comfortable style.

1o6c18o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hermeticism/comments/1o6c18o/we_dont_need_to_fight_our_inner_demons_we_need_to/,`We don't need to fight our inner demons. We need to tame them. Here's a guide to understanding the Ego's hidden buttons.`,"
**TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read):** Your Ego controls you by activating ""inner demons"" like anger and fear. Don't fight them. Tame them. The key is to slow down, observe the emotion without believing it, and create a space for a conscious choice. Recognize the pattern, and you take back your power.



*(Note: The text below is a full, in-depth chapter from my upcoming book, 'The Seal of Truth'. It's a longer read, so you might want to grab a coffee for this one.)*


**Chapter 1: The Ego - The Tool That Became the Master**

When the ancient Jewish sages said, ""I have created the Evil Inclination, and I have created Divine Wisdom as its spice,"" they revealed the very foundation of the human soul: that within us exists a force, essential yet dangerous, called the ego.

**What is the ego?**

The ego is not a trait, an emotion, or a weakness. It is an existential mechanism, deep and ancient. It is software installed in every person’s consciousness at the moment of birth.

This is not a mistake, nor is it a malfunction. The ego was created to serve us: to protect our physical existence, to push us to grow, to distinguish between self and other, to choose.

The ego constantly asks: ""What do I need?""
In the beginning, this is the right question. A child needs food, warmth, a sense of belonging. But over the years, if a person does not learn to manage the ego, they find themselves managed by it. The question evolves from ""What do I need?"" to ""Why don't I have it?"", and from there to ""Why does *he* have it?""

**The Ego as an Unchecked Tool**

Imagine an advanced software program created to operate a powerful machine. If no one operates it from a higher consciousness, it will start to run everything on its own. This is how the ego operates.

It is not evil; it simply runs on autopilot. This autopilot generates an entire worldview: I am at the center, and the world is meant to serve me. Anything that doesn't suit me is a threat. Anyone more successful is a disappointment. And here, the great pain arises, because in this reality, the ego never allows a person to feel whole.

**The Ego Creates Separation**

One of the laws by which the ego operates is ""divide and conquer."" It separates us from others, from ourselves, and from reality. For example: instead of seeing another person as a partner, the ego sees a rival. Instead of seeing failure as an opportunity, it sees proof that ""I am not enough.""

Thus, an inner reality of mistrust is built, a constant need to prove, compare, and control. When a person is so busy building walls around their heart, how can true love ever enter?

**The Inner Demons: The Ego’s Hidden Buttons**

For most of our lives, we think we are making choices. But often, a hidden system of emotional forces operates us. I call these forces our ""inner demons.""

They do not come from outside. They sit within us, quiet but alert. And when something external touches a certain point, as if a button were pressed, the demon awakens. The reaction is immediate: emotional, blind, powerful. And almost always, we will feel that we are right.

This is the power of the ego: it activates the demon through an invisible button and then whispers: ""This is not an overreaction - it's a justified response. You are simply seeing the truth.""

The ancient Jewish sages called this mechanism the 'Evil Inclination' because they were honest about its destructive power. Let's understand that the ego is both: a necessary technical mechanism, but when it operates without supervision, it becomes a destructive force.

**Taming the Demons: Observation That Brings Freedom**

We are not here to fight our demons. The inner world is too delicate for wars. The goal is not to eliminate jealousy, anger, or fear, but to tame them. To give them a name, to understand them, and crucially, *not to believe them*. Because the moment we believe a demon, it becomes our truth.

**To See, Without Immediately Acting**

The first step in taming is to slow down. It sounds simple, but it is a revolutionary act.
Instead of reacting, stop.
Instead of answering, ask.
Instead of believing, observe.

The moment a space is created between a stimulus and our response, that is where freedom begins.

When a demon like jealousy awakens, instead of letting it drive, we can say internally: ""I see you. You are within me, but you are not my leader."" This simple act of speaking creates a distinction. And distinction is the beginning of transformation.

**Three Stages of Taming:**

1.  **Recognition:** Identify the ""buttons"" that trigger your demons.
2.  **Willingness to See:** Feel the uncomfortable sensation without running from it. Simply stay with it.
3.  **Conscious Response:** Choose a different reaction. Quiet. A breath. Even silence is an action, when done by choice.

**Practice: Daily Journaling of a Moment**

At the end of each day, sit quietly and answer three questions:
1.  When did I feel emotionally triggered today?
2.  What was the button that was pressed?
3.  Did I act out of reaction, or out of choice?

This practice is not judgmental. It is a mirror to the soul, teaching you to know yourself through loving eyes.

**Patience and Compassion: The Foundations of Taming**

The demons do not leave quickly. They have lived in us for years. They do not need to disappear; they need to get to know us anew, to understand that we no longer believe them as we once did. Every time we choose to see instead of to fight, they will calm down, the ego will quiet down, and we will begin to lead our lives from within.

That’s true but narcissists grieve very differently from those without personality disorders.

Returning to social media shortly after the loss of a child, posting looking as happy as ever, showing coffee runs, shopping trips, GRWM, and looking like they’ve had a glow up seems strange to most people…

They focus on their own healing and experiences or “grief journey” rather than the deceased and may only publicly address the loss after being criticized for not grieving “properly.”

Importantly, they return not only because it is their “job”, but to seek attention and validation.

These behaviors reflect classic narcissistic traits..

Protecting their image, controlling perception, and performing strength. These are largely “performative”, not normal grief.

Also, I’m sorry for complaining about this, I just need to get this off my chest. 

I’m currently a student teacher and my edTPA is due this week. I didn’t procrastinate at all, but I feel like there’s still so much to do that I have to have done before I submit. Right now, I’ve been waking up at 5 am to be at work by 6:30 (7 am start time), then I’m at school until at LEAST 3, then I go to my university’s library until they close at 10 (they’re closing early because it’s fall break). 

Today I have to stay at school until 5 for parent teacher conferences and then have a presentation at 6, so I probably won’t be able to start working until 7. 

I’m drinking insane amounts of coffee right now. I have this heart condition where I’m not supposed to drink caffeine, but I don’t know how else to get everything done. It’s pretty much ruined my stomach at this point. 

My program has a really strict attendance policy and doctors notes don’t excuse anything. I have 2 absences I can use until December 17th (my last day). I want to use one to take a day to work on this edTPA, but I don’t think that would be a smart choice. 

I’ve been sick from the stress for days now. I’m having stomach problems and the caffeine is making my heart rate concerningly high. I just don’t know what to do at this point, I feel sleep deprived.",20,1760438368.0,Teachers,11,0.95,False
1o6bywt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManagedByNarcissists/comments/1o6bywt/do_i_have_a_n_boss/,Do I have a N boss?,"I just started working at a coffee shop part time a month ago. The boss there seemed nice, he asked me if i was interested in a job when I was there randomly buying a coffee (red flag maybe?). 

Since I started, my colleague immediately told me how bad he his, moody and controlling, etc etc, and how many people have immediately quit after starting/ doing trial shifts. 

The things that make me suspicious: 

- he is micromanaging A LOT. He gets angry if there is drops of water around the sink after washing my hands. And crumbles after making food. And if I don’t immediately do it while tending to customers and doing 100 things you need to do at a coffee shop at the same time, I’m «messy». He wants us to write down lists with things we have to do that day and write who did what.(!) He has cameras recording the counter/ cashier(?) that he says are only active after hours for safety. But he has an app on his phone directly to the cameras, and Im 100% sure he’s watching us (it also has microphone). 

- he’s never talkative or nice, he just says hi in the morning and then sits at the cafe working on his computer. He’s very nice with customers. 

- when I started he told me I could have a 15 min break, which is nice since Im only working four hours a day. One day I took a break because my dad was visiting for 15 minutes (I took the time) and the next day he sat me down and was angry with me because I did that? He said that eating behind the counter counts as a break. 

- he trash talks me behind my back to my coworker, who shares everything with me.

- he uses things against me that has happened a long time ago, and only a few times. I have come right on time to my shift a couple of times and maybe two three minutes late a couple of times and he sits there watching the clock. I know it’s my fault for coming late (and not being changed and ready when my shift starts), but this has almost not happened, and if they happened, it’s because of the bus being late. This for him becomes evidence of my complete inability to do the job. 

It all got to a climax yesterday when I was making myself a latte, and he started questioning how many I have had that day and that I had to pay for it. I told him that when I started he told me I could drink as much coffee as I wanted, in which he replied that he meant filter coffee(!!!). So I tried to say that okey, that’s fine, but you didn’t specify that. 

And then he tried to make a fool out of me for not understanding that a latte isn’t coffee, it’s milk, and how much milk he is spending on me each week. It became a loud discussion in the cafe and he got really angry with me because I wouldn’t back down. I didn’t say anything unprofessional, I just tried to say that he didn’t give me that information so he couldn’t be angry with me. (And that a latte is in fact a coffee) 

He then suddenly told me to leave immediately. I asked him «do you mean that?» and he said eventually «no.» 
so I stayed and worked and he tried to talk more with me, saying he’s very disappointed and that I’m a smart girl but this doesn’t suffice. He brought up «all» the times I’ve been late and in his eyes have done a bad job. I then told him calmly that I quit. He didn’t really react, he said to send him a mail in the evening. I didn’t send him the mail, I wanted to see how things were today. And I want him to fire me so that I can have more rights. 

Today I woke up ready to go to work and he wrote that I didn’t need to come and that he will let me know when they need me. I asked him if this was him firing me and he said no, but that I am an extra worker by contract.

However, my contract also says I have to work 4 hours a day, so I don’t know what to make of it. I’m going to se my union rep today.

I am in Europe. I remember a time where the only non-diary option at any coffee shop was soy milk (if at all). Then it was soy or oat.  Nowadays, across different cities and even countries, I am never ever offered soy milk, it's always oat. It's been like that for a few years. Sometimes they have pea milk which I am very happy about, I find it just as good or better but rare (used to be more poplar where I live for a short while). 99% of time I am offered oat milk.  
  
Why is that? It seems so strange to me. Even the nicest oat milk is still a little sour and lacks substance both in subjective experience (feels watery and rarely foams well) and in terms of nutrition. It's also more expensive. I don't understand it at all. 

After testing all the options, personally at home I use exclusively soy milk for my milk coffees.   
Yet I am unable to ask for it when I make an order. This is very frustrating but maybe there is something I don't know. Is oat considered ""better""?",12,1760438000.0,barista,14,0.83,False

Maybe I just need a stronger cup of coffee?,"I’ve been an executive assistant for a while now, and honestly I’ve always loved it. There’s something deeply satisfying about keeping things together when everything around you feels like it’s falling apart. I love organizing chaos, finding calm in other people’s storms, anticipating needs before they’re spoken. It’s one of those roles that demands your brain, heart, and intuition all at once, and I’ve always thrived on that.

But lately, something’s shifted.

I still love the work, the problem-solving, the planning, the rhythm of keeping someone’s world spinning. But when I wake up in the morning, I just dread it. Not because of the job itself, but because of where I’m doing it. The atmosphere feels heavy. The energy drains me before I even log in. I find myself staring at my screen, coffee in hand, trying to remember why I used to look forward to my day.

It’s like I’m doing everything right, but somehow, it’s not enough or maybe it’s just not seen. And that’s the part that hurts the most. Because EAs give so much of themselves to make things work behind the scenes, and when the environment starts to feel toxic or cold, it seeps into everything.

I keep asking myself if this is burnout creeping in or if it’s just my gut whispering that I’ve outgrown this place. I don’t want to lose my love for what I do just because the environment isn’t right.

1o6bwaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1o6bwaq/help_with_bio_on_dating_app/,Help with bio on dating app,"Hi everyone,

Hetero 25M here.

Over time, I grew disillusioned with dating apps. Recently, a friend showed me a new one called *DeepBond*, and I decided to give it a shot. I liked it, the people there seemed more natural and laid-back , so I tried breaking away from my usual bios. I went for something more humorous and bold, something that actually reflects how I am:

>I’m the kind of person who, at first glance, many call boring, until they realize I’m actually a smiles magnet.

>I got rich charging $1 every time someone said that, so now I’m just looking for someone to help me spend this newly discovered fortune.

>If you’re curious (essential), a little adventurous, love chatting about a thousand different things, enjoy both the outdoors and the couch, and know how to laugh at yourself (and at me), say hi. I’ve got a spot saved just for you.

It might’ve been a bit irreverent, and maybe a little intense, since it’s been two weeks and not a single like. On Tinder, with a much plainer, more conventional bio, I got more attention…

Now I’m thinking of switching to this one:

>I’m naturally curious. If something grabs my attention, I lose track of time reading, exploring, asking questions. I might come off as a tad intense with all the curiosity, but I promise: it’s just childlike enthusiasm.

>I enjoy conversations that make me think, peaceful places, and people who feel good to be around. Animals too.

>People say I’m naturally funny (and no, it’s not my mum saying that), a calming presence, and a good listener. Good guy? You tell me after coffee.

What do you think about this one? 

For context: I’ve got four photos: one with a friend, one in an amazing setting, and two where I’m smiling.

1. Nutritional Powerhouse: It's loaded with essential minerals like potassium, magnesium, and iron, providing genuine nutritional value that white sugar completely lacks.

2. Lower Glycemic Index (GI): Date syrup causes a slower, more gradual rise in blood sugar, helping you avoid dramatic energy spikes and the dreaded afternoon crash.

3. Packed with Antioxidants: Dates are rich in flavonoids, carotenoids, and phenolic acid which fight off oxidative stress and support your body's defense against chronic diseases.

4. Digestive System Friend: Contains soluble fiber that aids digestion, promotes regular bowel movements, and supports a healthy gut microbiome.

5. Complex Flavor Profile: Offers a rich, deep flavor with natural notes of caramel, vanilla, and molasses, enhancing food rather than just masking it with sweetness.

6. A True Whole Food Sweetener: It’s made from just one ingredient—dates! No heavy refining, no chemical processing, and no artificial additives.

7. Incredible Kitchen Versatility: Can be used anywhere you’d use sugar, honey, or maple syrup—from baking to savory marinades and glazes.

8. Supports Bone Health: Contains calcium and phosphorus, which are essential building blocks for maintaining strong bones and teeth long-term.

9. More Sustainable Choice: Date palms thrive in arid regions, often requiring less water than vast sugarcane fields, making it an environmentally conscious choice.

10. Deliciously Satisfying: Due to its rich flavor and fiber content, you may find that you naturally need less syrup to feel satisfied, helping you reduce your overall sugar intake mindfully.

**Chapter 9 - Alchemy**

“Isaac?” I asked. My friends and I were gathered on our usual spot at the dinner table. I didn’t see Luna anywhere. Honestly, I was kind of nervous about the upcoming study date. I’d spent my school day wondering how exactly I’d approach things for the best chance to get involved in the crime.

Still, the conversation with her had been strangely… nice. Almost nice enough to forget that Lich Queen Luna had killed me just two days ago.

“What is it?” Isaac said with a sigh.

“Has Luna ever hurt someone in school?” I asked.

“In what way?” Isaac asked.

“Like has she ever been violent?” I asked. “Everyone hates her, but I can’t remember her actually getting into any problems. Why does everyone hate her?”

“For fuck’s sakes, Kai, you really are in love,” Joshua said, leaning back.

“No, Josh, I’m on a mission,” I said.

“And you’re losing it,” Joshua said. “You’re headed to the biggest heartbreak of your life, Kai. There’s no way anything will ever happen between you two.”

“I don’t recall Luna ever being violent,” Isaac said. “She just acts weird. Like with yesterday’s snake incident. Ella said Luna used magic in school. Not that anyone really cares.” He considered his words and added, “But yeah, I agree with Josh. I don’t think you should get yourself excited, Kai. Luna has rejected everyone that asked her out.”

“Luna came to school wearing Kai’s jacket today,” Higu blurted out.

Joshua jumped from his seat and spat out his drink straight onto Isaac’s uniform. He grabbed Higu’s collar. “No shot. What did you just say?”

“It’s true,” Higu said, leaning back from Joshua’s stare. “I was heading up to class when I saw Luna and Kai enter together. Luna wore Kai’s blue jacket, and Kai wore some old red one.”

“My mom’s beautiful vibrant red jacket,” I added.

Joshua stared straight into my soul. “Kai… Explain.”

“Luna borrowed my jacket for a bit,” I said. “Hers broke apparently.”

“What do you mean *she borrowed your jacket*!?” Joshua asked. “How? How did you get her to wear your jacket?”

“I tossed it straight at her face,” I said. “She survived the impact, unfortunately. I thought she would blow up.”

“Offering a girl your jacket in Lokora is the straightest way to their hearts, you know,” Joshua said. “Holy shit, Kai, you might actually have a chance!”

“I also asked her on a date,” I said.

“W—” Joshua stuttered. “W… Huh?”

Isaac wore an amused grin, leaning back on his chair. Higu was staring at me. “What did she say?”

“She’s coming as long as it’s a study date,” I said. “Probably.”

“Yeah, no, fuck this,” Joshua said. “Kai, she’ll curse you for all the life you have remaining. Forget the date. Just join us at Bob’s tonight.”

*She already killed me once, thank you very much,* I thought. Then I paused and asked, “Wait, Bob’s is still open?”

“Yes?” Joshua said. “Of course it’s open? I think?”

“It is open,” Isaac said. “Higu and I are running the haunted house.”

Suddenly, a grin appeared on my face. Bob’s Funhouse. The legendary *night club* in Lokora’s town centre, aimed at the Academy’s underage students. Bob’s was arguably the best place to spend excess money in this town, or to just hang out after school. I had genuinely fun memories from that hellhole until its closing after the disaster.

“I’ll see if I have time to visit,” I said and picked up my tray. “Been a busy week.”

“Kai, you lucky asshat,” Joshua said with a sigh.

“Next up is alchemy, right?” I asked.

“Next up is a punch to your face,” Joshua said.

“Yes, it’s alchemy,” Isaac said.

I nodded. “I’ll go early. I might actually need to pay attention for this class.”

\*\*\*

Alchemy used to be my favourite subject. It still was. One could argue that magic was actually just alchemy with the recipe formed inside a mage’s veins. Lichcraft was technically alchemy as well. Apparently, if a mage wanted to succeed as a spellcaster, they had to also succeed as an alchemist. Or so my teacher had claimed.

Personally, I didn’t succeed in either, but I genuinely enjoyed Johannes Longfield’s alchemy lessons. I had thirteen years ago, and I did now.

“Alright, class time,” Johannes said. “I missed my coffee, unfortunately, so you bunch will have to make up for my enthusiasm.”

Despite the words, Johannes was smiling. His black hair was rough and messy—the type of haircut that looked terrible on ninety nine percent of people, but Johannes somehow looked good in it. If I recalled, Johannes was thirty one years old at the time of the incident, but he looked five years younger.

“We’ve got a fun experiment today,” Johannes said. “We’re crafting greyroot wisdom potions.”

Ella lifted her head and asked. “Wisdom potions? I thought wisdom potions didn’t exist?”

“Oh, but yes they do,” Johannes said. “All of you will be making one right now.”

He lifted a small basin on his table and held up four ingredients. The greyroots, water, a vial of something that looked like some sort of juice, and mana powder: the active ingredient for most alchemical reactions.

“Wisdom potions classify alongside love potions as the most sought after requests for any aspiring alchemist,” Johannes said. “The dumb are always looking to grow wiser. Right here, I’ve prepared the ingredients for the strongest wisdom potion a customer will ever require. I used to sell dozens of these yearly during my years as a herbalist. And for good measure, we’ll be holding another competition. The winner gets one free ride ticket to Bob’s. Interested?”

The classroom suddenly filled up with whispers.

“Good, good,” Johannes said. “The rules are simple. The one who creates the most bitter wisdom potion of all wins. I’ve hired a tongue to do the testing. Good luck!”

Johannes laid out more of the ingredients on the table for students to grab. With everything ready, he went silent and let the students tackle the problem on their own.

Most chit-chat on nearby desks revolved around the question of what a wisdom potion was and how the hell were they supposed to create one without any guidance. Students picked up their textbooks for information without much luck.

*I can’t believe I still remember this class,* I thought. *Thirteen years later, and the solution is clear in my head.*

I glanced at the corner of the classroom. Luna remained on her seat with her attention toward the wall beside her. Luna didn’t get up to participate in the event. She was rarely invested in class activities.

I decided to head over. I grabbed a seat and joined her. “Not interested in wisdom potions?”

Luna turned her head vaguely in my direction. “They don’t exist,” Luna said. “Those ingredients won’t make anything.”

I smiled. The expression came out on its own. “They definitely do,” I said. “Not a wisdom potion. But they do make *something*.”

Behind us, the first explosion went off.

One of the girls whose name might have been Amber yelled out. A cloud of misty smoke blew up on her face.

“The smoke is harmless, don’t worry,” Johannes said. “But the potion is a failure. Does anyone know why the ingredients exploded?”

Students were still chit-chatting with each other. Nobody seemed to have an answer.

“Kai,” Johannes said, turning his grin to me. “I’ve heard the rumors. You’ve supposedly turned into a genius overnight.”

I flinched. “Maybe a bit?”

Johannes nodded. “As a reward for your efforts and prowess, you can expect to be scrutinized and called out by every teacher who all suddenly expect greatness from you. Do you know what caused the explosion?”

“Rule number four of alchemical reactions, sir,” I said. “If an active ingredient is added to an unstable mixture, an explosion will happen. Greyroots are, by design, unstable.”

Johannes grinned at the answer. “So you *have* turned into a genius. That’s a perfect answer.” He turned to the rest of the class. “I was planning on offering a hint, but Kai’s answer has already mentioned half of it. For the wisdom potion to succeed, you must figure out how to add an active ingredient into a greyroot mixture without causing an explosion.”

The rest of the class continued on their experiments. Except for my three friends, who were discreetly—the very obvious type of *discreetly*—staring at Luna and I. I ignored them and hoped that Luna would too.

“Impressive,” Luna said.

She didn’t sound impressed. “Alchemy is one of my best subjects,” I said. “Very useful. What about you? You must already know what we’re making, right?”

*Of course you do,* I thought. *You exploded the cauldron. Anyone who’s experienced with lichcraft is a good alchemist.*

Luna shrugged. “My tutors don’t care about my alchemy scores. It’s most important that I channel mana well.”

“Your tutors would probably benefit from a wisdom potion or two,” I said.

Luna shrugged. “Does the potion actually exist?”

I paused. The question seemed honest. Did Luna actually not know what we were doing?

“No, wisdom potions don’t exist,” I said. “Learning that is a part of this lesson. Herbalists sell wisdom potions if asked, but the potions don’t actually have any effects. They just taste so hideous that anyone who drinks them is forced to rethink their life, and thus, grow wiser.”

“So the goal of the competition is to create the most bitter liquid?”

“Quite literally,” I said. “Greyroots are already bitter. When combined with mana, the atomic structure is mixed up. I don’t really know the theory, but the bitterness is amplified. Before adding mana, you just need to make the greyroot less unstable.”

“Mmm,” Luna said with little enthusiasm. “You know the solution. Are you not making the potion?”

“I’ll do it,” I said. “I actually want the prize this time.”

I went to grab the ingredients, bringing them back to Luna’s table. I explained each step of the process in detail. Luna was listening, vaguely interested but far from enthusiastic. The tables around me seemed to be far more interested in copying whatever I was doing.

Ten minutes later, Johannes called time. Potions were brought to the front to be tested with a simple PH-scale. Around half of my classmates had managed to mix together something vaguely bitter. Most potions were a purplish color. Mine, however, was a healthy-looking turquoise.

The winner wasn’t announced yet. Now was the time for Johannes’s actual lecture to start. He explained the theory behind unstable ingredients in a way that could be replicated anywhere, not just for this experiment.

This was another one of Johannes’s tricks. He started lessons with something interesting, and he saved the conclusion for that interesting thing as the very last thing for class. His classes were like alchemy themselves.

After the lecture, his explanation of theory led seamlessly back to the competition and its winner.

My potion, as it turned out, was exactly what Johannes had been looking for. He admired my potion as the best wisdom potion anyone had ever created in his class. It was the most bitter drink, and it somehow looked the most edible, and thus would sell better.

As a prize, I received a ride ticket for Bob’s Funhouse. Any ride of my choosing.

“Congratulations to Kai,” Johannes said. “We’ll have tests next week. Make sure to study. Or don’t if you don’t mind hanging out in these classes for another year. Good night, everyone!”

My classmates began packing their bags. Some left right away, including Luna. A few girls stayed to talk with Johannes. I wondered if I should run after Luna again, but she probably needed time for herself as well. I’d pestered her a lot already.

I stayed on my seat, examining the ticket. Around two years from now, Johannes would be dying in prison as the culprit behind a horrific disaster. The same teacher that somehow made students form crushes on him was supposedly a mass murderer.

Johannes *was* involved in lichcraft in one way or another. That much was confirmed. But what exactly was his involvement with the crimes?

“There is just no way,” Joshua said, arriving on my table. “You’re an alchemical genius as well?”

I laughed awkwardly. “Alchemy was always my best subject.”

“Yeah, and you ditched helping us to hang out with your date,” Joshua said with a sigh. “Can’t say I blame you. But the betrayal still hurts.”

“Wait,” Ella said from a few seats over, her face opening up in confusion. “Kai is dating Luna?”

“Kinda,” Joshua said.

“Actually?” Ella asked.

“No,” I said with a laugh. “She barely even considers me a friend.”

“They’re going on a study date, apparently,” Joshua said. When Ella gave him a look, he shrugged. She pouted at me.

I ignored her and asked, “Alchemy was our last class, right?”

“Yeah,” Joshua said. “If you’re heading on a date, I’d like to have that ticket.”

I slid the ticket in my pockets. “Maybe I’ll give it to Luna, eh?”

I exited the class, to the trunk of the World Tree. I glanced down the spiraling stairway just in time to see Luna exit the academy, her hands in the pockets of her summer jacket as she disappeared into the cold.

Joshua stood beside me. “That didn’t look like your jacket, Kai.”

I sighed. “She’s a weird one.”

I exited as well, carrying my mom’s jacket home, and prepared for the date.",3,1760437651.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

They had the supply the ingredients and cups and lids and stirrers and creamers and the whatnot. The machine that has replaced it has all that in it except it doesn't have stirrers, it doesn't have sleeves for the cups when they come out hot and it doesn't have lids. Why would you put a hot liquid machine in for employees when it doesn't protect you against what it's producing. I had to leave my cup in there for about 5 minutes because it was way too hot to touch and then be careful to remove it and test it out to start drinking because there's no lid. How is this making it efficient for people that want to take it and go. The tiny little thing that we enjoyed most about the day was getting a free item and now they've gotten rid of that and what they put in its place is just terrible. It reminds me of when McDonald's got sued for hot coffee spilling on a customer's lap in the car.  talk about liability here.
