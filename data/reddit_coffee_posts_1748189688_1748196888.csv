We were waiting for bus and at that point  I am nearly unconscious from how bad I felt, the bus comes and it was full with tourists that were going to the airport, we get in and 2 stops further I turn pale, I fell that I'm gonna puke my guts out. My friend notices my ghost like appearance and let's me sit, for a while I thought that it became better, moments later I puke inside my mouth and then after tasting it I puke all over the front of the bus, it was on some old ladys purse inside some tourists bags, it was EVERYWHERE, they had a whole ass thanksgiving meal puke in they're bags, thankfully they were nice and helped me out, gave me some paper towels to clean myself up,as soon as we go out the bus my friends start to die of laughter me myself was barely holding in my laughter",4,1748196605.0,confession,2,1.0,False

I know this code looks ghastly, but given it was being handled just fine, and all of a sudden it didn't, i cannot really explain this. I restarted the pc, I checked memory and cpu usage (30, and 10% respectively) using mainly just two cores, nothing works.  
i really cannot understand why, it is hindering the progression of my work a lot because i rely on being able to make changes quickly as soon as i see something wrong, but now i have two wait 30 minutes before even knowing what is wrong. One possible issue is that these files are in folders where multiple py files call for the same datasets, but they are inactive so this should not be a problem.

:there's no need to read this second part, but i put it in if you're interested

THE MATH: I'm trying to define a distribution for a stochastic process in such a way that it resembles the empirical distribution observed in the past for this process (yes the data i have is stationary), to do this i'm trying to build a jump diffusion process (lognormal, poisson, normally distributed jump sizes). In order for this jump diffusion process to match my empirical distribution i created two systems of equations: one where i equated the expected value of the standard brownian motion with the one of the jump diffusion, and did the same for the expected values of their second moments, and a second where i equated the kurtosis of the empirical distribution to the standardised fourth moment of the jump diffusion, and the skew of the empirical to the third standardised moment of the jump diffusion.  
Since i am too lazy to go and open up a book and do it the right way or to learn how to set up a maximum likelihood estimation i opted for a brute gride search.  
Why all this??  
i'm working on inserting alternative assets in an investment portfolio, namely art, in order to do so with more advance techniques, such as CVaR or the jacobi bellman dynamic programming approach, i need to define the distribution of my returns, and art returns are very skewed and and have a lot of kurtosis, simply defining their behaviour as a lognormal brownian motion with N(mean, std) would cancel out any asymmetry which characterises the asset.

1kv8zpg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kv8zpg,Backyard needs fixing,"Hey everyone, im looking for some help with my backyard. 

Major issues:
Boulders around the pool having been cracking more and more year over year. I believe its due to the tension from summer to winter and being next to the pool. Last year i repaired the main stone steps and had to paint it - which did not come out good at all.
Landscaping was set with large gaps in between and every year i try to seal it with something else but no sand or cement has worked or ever lasted.

Smaller issues:
The square pit and the turf area is just weed infested no matter what I've tried to do (like replacing grass with turf). Cant turn the square into a firepit as when the backyard was completed years ago, they dug too close to the gas lines and they run right underneath that square. It was used for plants but now im reconsidering removing it.

My question is how can i fix up this backyard and make it look new. I want to remove the boulders around the pool as the cracking is getting worse and eventually i fear they will be unusable and can add a hazard, especially with debris falling into the pool and damaging that as well.

Willing to put in some money to fix it up but i dont have much to go to the extreme price ranges. Can put in the work myself to demo what i need to but not experienced enough to install anything new.

Im 24 and just live with my mom, i want to pay for the backyard myself and have been saving up a 'home reno' budget for a few years now. Allocating 10-20k for the backyard and hoping thats enough to spruce her up for entertaining.

Side info:
Currently have
Furniture: 2 tanning chairs, 3 two-seaters, 5 one-seaters, 2 coffee tables, dining table w/ 6 chairs.
A BBQ is not pictured but its on a step up beside the backyard door.

Any help/advice is appreciated.

Sicily’s Tastiest Identity Test,"There are few things that unite Sicilians more than their love for deep-fried, golden orbs of joy filled with rice, ragu, cheese, or even pistachio. But ask a Sicilian what they’re called, and instead of unity, you might just spark a civil war — or at least an extremely passionate debate over coffee and cannoli.

[**Is it arancino or arancina?**](https://dolcevitasicilia.com/the-first-time-i-tried-arancini-savoring-the-whole-of-sicily/)

The answer depends entirely on where you are, who you ask, and how likely they are to forgive you for getting it “wrong.”

This is the story of Sicily’s most delicious divide — one that has nothing to do with taste and everything to do with pride, dialect, and identity.

And yes, by the end of this article, you’ll know how to tell where someone has been in Sicily just by listening to how they order their rice balls.

# 🍊 First, What Is an Arancino/Arancina?

Let’s agree on this much: no matter what you call it, you’re talking about a ball (or cone) of saffron-infused rice, filled with ragu or other delights, coated in breadcrumbs, and deep-fried to crispy perfection.

The name — in both versions — comes from the Italian word for orange (arancia), as the original shape and color resemble the fruit.

But here’s where things get spicy.

1kv8v6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1kv8v6s/youre_not_his_dad/,“You’re not his dad”,"My partner and I have been her raising her 5 yr old son since right before he turned two. His bio-dad passed away almost about year ago, so I’m his only father figure. 

I’ll admit, things have been extremely difficult. He’s a great kid- so loving, kind-hearted, hilarious, and smart- but I was totally unprepared for this. Raising a kid is so difficult. 

I don’t know where to begin but I honestly, mostly, don’t enjoy being around them. Like in the moment I feel miserable but when I look back I think “oh yeah that was a good day”. 

 Like yesterday we walked to the library and spent some time there and then came home, watched a movie and went out for pizza. 

From the crack of dawn, this boy does not stop talking, interrupting, asking questions, making noises. He whined the entire time we walked, which took over an hour both ways. 
He’s defiant most of the time, contrarian like he’ll ask us a question like “ is today Sunday?” and we’ll say “yeah” and he says “no it’s not!” And gets upset. 
He wouldn’t stop playing in the dirt at dinner, despite us telling him to stop kicking up rocks and to stop putting them on the table. 

Every demand, every request, every suggestion is met with defiance from him. 

Neither me or my partner had a good time yesterday, we were both just miserable because of him. 

But if I were to look back at yesterday and think of how it went, I would remember how great the weather was, how delicious the food we ate was, the origami we made at the library, my partner and I laughing after having a couple of drinks that night, and how when we told our son not to eat on the couch he made  plank with his body from the couch to the coffee table and ate his snacks like that and it was hilarious 

Always, she brings up that she might take him to grandma‘s and I got excited because we’ve had maybe three days alone this year, and not even days, but like a few hours. And one of those days was because I had a doctors appointment and the other was to go do yardwork at her parents.
We haven’t been on a date in almost a year, we don’t have time to ourselves, we don’t have time for our selves. 

So when I got excited at the thought of having some time to ourselves, she noticed it, and she said something to the effect “you really don’t like him do you?”. Which I felt was super offensive because of course I do love him, but I also want some time away from him. 

Then later in the day my partner jokingly said something about “throwing him off….” And then she trailed off but I got the gist. But I know there are some truth there to her, expressing her frustration. 

Fast forward to today, it’s basically a repeat of yesterday, and we are at the grocery store- he wants me to hold him, he wants to get down and walk, he wants to get in the cart, can he have this treat, can he have that treat, I want this, I want that, climbing on the freezers, running down the aisles, not asking to touch things before he touches them which I told him to do and he knows to do. 

It was just an exhausting experience and he’s going a mile per minute in the car, and this is all after he’s been just talking all morning, and just being wild. 

We get home and I just tell my partner that he’s driving me crazy. And she got offended and told me that I don’t have to come to the park with them. Like she doesn’t want me to come with them because she knows I’m not. It’s not gonna be a good time because I’m not gonna be in a good mood.
I’m a little stressed out because I want to go to the park with them, I want to go on a walk, I want to have a good day, but the reality is so different. We could go to the park and plan on going for a walk, but he may have a change of plans, he may want to play in the playground, or go ride his bike, and we can do those things, but it ultimately interferes with us doing what we want to do. So more often than not I feel frustrated because things don’t go the way I want them to and I feel like my whole life is out of my control.

And I just flipped my lid.

The issue is I feel like it’s so unfair that we both have the same feelings and that when she expresses them I just like let it slide because I know that it’s a lot, but if I express them, she gets so offended and when I brought it up to her she told me it’s because I’m not his dad.

This boy has called me dad since I’ve known him. I am his daddy. I was there every day, changing diapers, fixing meals, doing baths, playing with him, and he saw his bio dad on the weekends, every other weekend at that. And since his bio dad has passed, I have stepped up to be his dad because he no longer has one.

I know she said that because she says I can just walk away, because I’m not his dad I don’t have to stay, but it’s hurtful for her to say that to me.

And it doesn’t address the issue which I think is the bigger problem that I feel like I’m expected to be a parent with all the responsibilities, but with the consequences of being a parent, I get treated like a stranger.  I’m expected to do the work and when I get upset for the same reasons that she does, it’s not OK.

I really am contemplating just being done with this because I don’t think I would’ve chosen if I had known that this was gonna be the outcome. The life I thought we were gonna have together looked very different than what the reality is and I’m just frankly unhappy. Maybe it’ll get better as he gets older but it’s only gotten more difficult the older he’s gotten. But I know this is a very tumultuous age.

I don’t know. I’m just frustrated and trying to vent because I’m just like at the end of my rope right now.

I'm a 23-year-old entrepreneur from Europe, and I’m planning a solo 5-day trip to New York City – my first time ever visiting the U.S.

I don’t know anyone in the city yet, so I’m hoping to change that. I'd love to meet some cool people while I'm there, especially those involved in business, entrepreneurship, startups, or just anyone interesting and open-minded.

Whether you’re up for grabbing coffee, sharing some local tips, or making introductions – I’d truly appreciate it. If you’re a connector in the city or just someone down to chat and share some insight, let’s link up!

1kv8tad,https://v.redd.it/clip9dgcwy2f1,My cat made me splash coffee over my monitor - could it cause this artifacting?,"First of all, I want to say this is a really silly story, but I was curious if anyone here had any thoughts on the effects on my monitor. For about two and a half years I have been using an LG UltraGear 27GP95R-B 4K160 monitor for mixed gaming and office use. I have not had any issues with it during that time.

About two weeks ago, while working from home, one of my cats jumped on my desk and lay down on my keyboard. This happens a lot, but what she did next was new and unexpected to me: in an attempt to get more pets (while already being petted), she forcefully hit my hand - holding a cup of freshly poured coffee - and in doing so managed to splash about half the cup onto my monitor (from the middle downwards). After ensuring she was fine, I turned off the monitor, cleaned the spill, and let it dry for the rest of the day.

The next day I turned on the monitor and it worked as usual, so I did not think too much of it. But the past week, it has started to randomly glitch and produce artifacts (see the attached video). I have not been able to tie it to anything specific: some days nothing happens, other days it will glitch out several times in a few minutes, be fine for an hour, repeat the cycle. What bothers me the most is that the monitor goes black when using the OSD whenever a glitch occurs, which suggests to me it is a hardware issue.

I have already tried the following:

\- Replace the DP 1.4 cable with a DP 2.1 cable I had lying around. I know the bandwidth should not matter, but the DP 2.1 cable had not been used yet.

\- Run stress tests on my PC with OCCT, which did not flag any hardware-related issues with my PC.

\- Run DDU and reinstall the latest Nvidia drivers.

\- Switched over to HDMI for a day, it also produced said artifacts. I have not seen them pop up when connecting my PC to my OLED TV.

So far I have been unable to reproduce these artifacts myself, which makes it difficult to isolate the root cause, but given the earlier coffee spill it makes me suspect that my monitor is dying.

1kv8ssv,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1kv8ssv/my_metamour_sometimes_completely_ignores_me_and/,My metamour sometimes completely ignores me – and it's making me feel increasingly insecure,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about three years. He has another partner – my metamour – and we live in a smaller city where social circles and hangout spots often overlap. So it's not unusual that we run into each other.

I want to be clear: I don’t expect her to talk to me or interact with me all the time. That’s really not the issue. What’s difficult for me is how inconsistent her behavior is.

When my boyfriend is around, she's usually super friendly and nice. But there have been multiple situations where he e.g., went to the bathroom, and I tried to say hello – and she just completely ignored me. One time I walked past her sitting with a friend at a coffee shop, smiled and nodded, and she just looked away.

Last week, all of us were in the same bar. When she said goodbye to my boyfriend, I also wanted to say goodbye, but she just walked off. I ended up waving at her from a distance as she left with her friends. It felt awkward. 

This inconsistent behavior is starting to mess with my head a bit. It also makes me feel unsure around her close friends, some of whom are acquaintances of mine.

What adds to my confusion is that when we’re all in the same space – especially with my boyfriend present – she’s not just polite. She greets me warmly, gives me long hugs, and says things like “take care” when we part. It feels genuinely friendly in those moments, which makes the coldness in other situations feel even more jarring.

I’ve started to wonder if maybe she actually doesn’t want to engage with me at all – which would be totally fine – and perhaps only feels pressured to be warm or social when my boyfriend is present. That’s just a guess, but it’s left me unsure of how to interpret things, and whether I should talk to my boyfriend about it, speak to her directly, or just let it go.

How would you handle a situation like this?",2,1748196019.0,polyamory,1,1.0,False
1kv8s0s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kv8s0s,Small living room layout with bay window,"I just moved from a 1,500 sqft duplex to a small (but super charming!) apt at half the size. I’m trying to force my existing furniture to work with the space because funds are tight. 

The living room has a beautiful bay window that I love but it’s hard to figure out the couch placement. Initially I put it in front of the window but then TV watching was awkward. So I moved the couch to face the TV but is this a weird layout? This created a weird rug situation with the red one so I recently thrifted a larger rug to go under the whole couch. I also have a lounge chair that I shoved in the corner because I can’t figure out where else to put it. 

The coffee table has sentimental value but I kind of want to get something smaller and round for some better flow. I have a dog who jumps and plays and she’s already bonked her head on the corner poor thing. 

I also have layout questions about my awkwardly angled bedroom with no door but I feel like that should be in a separate post.

Trying to map out: 

1) Bagel Shop: good coffee for me and solid BEC for the both of us. 

2)  Site-seeing, shopping, etc. were both big sports fans, sneaker heads. 

3) Pizza for lunch. By the slice or splitting a pie, makes no difference.

I’ve had sesame (but not poppy) in a pork shoulder at a cookout years ago, in a sort of Asian-inspired rub with brown sugar, soy sauce, hoisin and garlic.  But a brisket is a much longer cook - would the seeds burn?

Tapered off but still got hit with the entire lot of withdrawal symptoms. When I was really in the thick of it, I happened to have a PCP appointment where he prescribed 150xl in a heartbeat. That was 5 weeks ago. 

Initially I felt pretty awful side effects, coffee throws me into an anxiety attack, self harm thoughts (they have faded with time but still pop up), weird itchy feeling on my face and neck like a sunburn, peeing ALL THE TIME, huge energy dips like I could fall asleep any moment, irregular sleep, and more.

When I have a moment to myself, I don’t really feel like doing anything, but at any given time there’s many things I could do. 

My question is, are these Wellbutrin side effects, or still weed withdrawals? I’ve quit smoking before, and had about 2 weeks of being uncomfortable, but then I seem to normalize. I don’t recall feeling this way during those withdrawals or after. Sort of wondering if I should be on this at all. Any one else go through something similar?

ich bin gerade dabei, meine erste eigene Kaffeemarke zu launchen: TropiCoffee – ein Kaffee, der fruchtig schmeckt. Kein Sirup, kein Instant-Mix – sondern richtige Kaffeebohnen mit Orangen-, Blaubeer-, Erdbeer- oder Kokos-Aroma.

Ich weiß, es klingt im ersten Moment ziemlich verrückt (das dachte ich auch 😅), aber das Feedback aus meinem Umfeld war überraschend positiv. Es soll kalt oder heiß trinkbar sein, komplett ohne Zucker, vegan.

Bohnen aus Brasilien. 50% Robusta / 50% Arabica.

Die Bohnen werden in Ried handgeröstet und nach dem Rösten mit natürlichen Aromen veredelt. Somit schmeckt der Kaffee nicht sauer oder süß sondern im Nachgang nur nach dem jeweiligen Aroma.

Wir starten mit Erdbeere, Kokos, Blaubeere und Orange.

Was denkt ihr:  
Würdet ihr sowas probieren?  
Ist Fruchtgeschmack im Kaffee ein No-Go oder genau das, was der Markt braucht?  
Was wäre ein Geschmack, den ihr mal trinken wollt?

Freu mich mega über ehrliches Feedback – sowohl kritisch als auch begeistert. Und wenn jemand neugierig ist – ich kann euch gern den Link zur Launch-Seite dalassen.

# Location:

An old 4-story apartment building in Edinburgh, Scotland. Built in 1890, it houses mostly young professionals and students.

# Victim:

**Emma Clarke**, 27, a freelance journalist.  
She lived alone in Apartment 3B (third floor). Known for investigating controversial political and corporate corruption.

# The Crime Scene

Emma was found dead in her apartment on **Sunday morning at 9:12 AM** by her upstairs neighbor, **Tommy Hughes**, who heard her phone ringing repeatedly and decided to check on her.

* Cause of Death: **Blunt force trauma to the back of the head**.
* No signs of forced entry.
* The door was **locked from the inside**.
* A half-finished **cup of coffee** was on the kitchen table.
* The **living room lamp** was broken on the floor.
* Her laptop was missing, but her **notepad with hand-written notes** was found on the table.
* No defensive wounds or DNA evidence under her nails.
* Windows were closed and latched.

# Timeline (Last 24 Hours)

* **Saturday, 2:00 PM** – Emma was seen entering the building with a **man in a gray coat** on the security camera. He was not recognized by neighbors.
* **Saturday, 4:30 PM** – A neighbor (**Mrs. Dale, 3C**) heard loud arguing through the wall but thought it was the TV.
* **Saturday, 7:00 PM** – The building’s Wi-Fi records show Emma’s phone disconnected.
* **Sunday, 9:12 AM** – Tommy finds the body and calls police.

  
**persons of interest:**

1. **Tommy Hughes (4B)**
   * Graphic designer, lives above Emma.
   * Claims to have been out Saturday night from 8:00 PM until 3:00 AM.
   * No alibi until CCTV shows him at a bar from 9:00 PM.
2. **Mrs. Dale (3C)**
   * Elderly neighbor. Heard arguing.
   * Claims Emma had visitors often and “seemed scared lately”.
3. **Lena Morgan**
   * Emma’s ex-girlfriend. They broke up 2 weeks ago.
   * Had a heated argument in public 3 days before Emma’s death.
   * She says they hadn’t spoken since.
4. **Alan Rivers**
   * A local politician Emma had recently investigated.
   * Denied any involvement and has a verified alibi for Saturday evening.

# Evidence & Clues

* **Notepad notes**: Emma had written: “—A deal at the docks? — L.M. knows more — Check voicemail Sunday — Danger closer than I thought.”
* **Voicemail on her landline (police accessed it)**: A distorted male voice:“You need to stop. Or you won’t be writing anything again. Final warning.”
* **Gray coat man**: Not identified. Appeared calm and carried a briefcase. Never left on camera.
* **Coffee mug fingerprints**: Only Emma’s and one partial unknown print — possibly smudged glove?
* **Front door lock**: High-security lock, **only one key missing** (Emma’s). Police found a tiny scratch inside the keyhole — **suggesting a lockpick or duplicate key**.

#  Your Challenge

* Who killed Emma?

It's a certain belief I have about the working of the World's gears. Though, as I think of it now, it must be quite silly -- is my thinking wrong? Is it perhaps limited to the unfortunate environment I am currently jailed in? Perhaps it looks different in further, more vivid parts of the World? Yet, my current thinking I cannot shake off.

My problem is such:

Every time I see a local establishment, like a small coffee shop or a restaurant, I feel sadness. I think ""is it worth it?"", ""do people actually come here?""... I live in a country whose population grows old. On nice days, I stroll around the main streets of my little town, and a sadness grows in me. My town is filled with abandoned, ruined buildings. Empty. Broken windows. Its local restaurants, bars, cafés -- they're all deserted. They are frequented only by the elderly, alone or in pairs. The young make their way to their known fast food chains in bigger cities, or, well, don't leave home at all.

And the terrible sadness, the misery in the picture of an elderly walking into an empty, poor establishment! Certainly, this establishment must have thrived in the past! Why doesn't it anymore? Where has its heart gone? Why don't friend groups spend time in their local bars anymore? Therefore: is it worth keeping up if none come there? Misery.

This image causes the worsening of a certain feeling I have, namely: Often I am certain places, shops, restaurants, doors on the street are fake. That in such they have been placed, for a reason unknown to me, and they stand; if I were to walk in, I would be foreign, unperceived, perhaps detested for daring? This feeling is one of a most intense calibre in me, strengthened by the fact that everything, everything in my environment seems empty. Everything is empty.

In that, I roam the street, and see elders walking into these establishments; I'm confused. Gravely. I think: ""what are you doing? Why are you going there? The place is empty. The place is dead. Do you not know that? What's the point? What's the point?""

Those living in big cities, centres, perhaps capitals, I ask you: is there thriving? Do you pass ruined, empty buildings on your walks in the city? Do the young go to coffee shops at all?",3,1748195164.0,Schizotypal,2,0.8,False

I need to share a thought that's been nagging at me, and I bet I'm not alone. I've spent countless hours building, debugging, implementing new features for my projects. Seeing the code take shape it's an incredibly satisfying feeling, but then, the moment comes when I ask myself: who am I going to show this to?

The truth is that it's not enough to just build. You also have to show. And everyone tells us: ""Build an audience on Twitter (X)! Join conversations! Be consistent!""

Here's the painful part. While I'm deep in my IDE, headphones on, cold coffee by my side, the idea of also having to ""tweet consistently"" paralyzes me. I try, I really do. Every now and then, I'll put out a thought, an update. But then days, weeks go by, and my X profile looks like a graveyard of good intentions. Commits pile up, progress is real, but on social media, it's a desert.

I feel like I have to choose between being a good developer and a good ""tweeter."" And, honestly, code always wins. But the fear that my hard work will go unnoticed is very real. Without an audience, how can I know if my product is useful? And most importantly, how will I reach future customers?

This constant battle between ""build"" and ""market"" inspired me to work on a tool. It aims to turn your Git commit messages into engaging posts for X, helping bridge that gap between coding and consistent online presence. It's still in a early phase, but the idea is to let your development work be your content.

1.5 years ago I bought this machine on eBay for a real steal, £90. It has done me well, but I do still prefer filter coffees generally. I’ve probably had around 30-40 coffees from this in that time. I recently came to use it after a couple of months out of use and it just doesn’t brew coffee (see video). I get pretty much 0g out after 30 seconds when I programmed this to be 35g out for 16g in. There is a soggy bed of coffee when I removed the portafilter after the failed brew, I think the machine just doesn’t get to the pressure required to push water through the puck.

I was in John Lewis earlier and used the opportunity to speak to a Sage employee. He recommended a descaler, and I additionally suggested espresso cleaning solution for backwashing. I have since run two descale cycles and three espresso cleaning cycles. I even paused the second descale run to let the machine soak with the descaler in for around 30 minutes. I also removed the group head and deep cleaned it also. It still behaves the exact same. Please can anyone help?

My second job is a part time one. I’ve worked at amazon, coffee shops and this is the one that i’ve liked the most so far. At least i’m learning a lot about painting.

Going to college looks so far for me, you might know why. 

I just wanna have basic stuff in my life: Education, a job where I can develop and then, depending of how everything goes having a family.

Never really posted anything like this online before and nobody I know has really been through anything like this so I wanted to just see if I could get some advice from the masses whilst I also get advice from family solicitors etc.

I received a call today from a social worker saying they have already done a home visit and spoken to my daughter (lets call her L) about her environment at home, this is all following a noise complaint from my ex-wife's (J) neighbour about her boyfriend (B) who has lived there full time for about 4/5 years screaming at 'the children' (they have a son together too).

For context, J and I's break up was ugly but eventually developed into a real effort to co-parent from both sides which I was really happy with and working really hard towards, a few years back I received messages from one of J's friends with screenshots of complaints about her boyfriend, use of drugs (never confirmed whether it was in the children's presence or not) and evidence of behaviour that was concerning at the least.

I went to J and we came to an agreement that L would stay with me until we could have a serious conversation about this and it came to light that B had some underlying mental health problems that he was medicated AND self medicating for (weed) and that it was all under control and they remained under a close eye from me for about a year following that, social services were never involved, although they were a very real threat.

Snap to today, I'm remembering that L is coming to me (she stays with me every other weekend) slightly dirty every now and, nails left uncut for a decent amount of time etc. Since she has told the social worker that she has to look after her little brother, she has to make J and B coffee using a coffee machine, she has to remind mummy that she needs to brush her teeth and she also needs to wake mummy up to take her to school.

She is also at a school attendance of 74% and when I was raised with the attitude that I literally have to be bleeding out or hospitalised to miss a day of school that horrifies me too haha.

My daughter is 7 years old and I currently feel nothing but sick and horrified having potentially overlooked something obvious. I have a home for her, there is no space or financial issues if she were to come and live with me full time and I am aware that because I am on the birth certificate and we were married that there will be no dispute about my parental responsibility, I am also aware that I can remove L from any situation that I deem unsafe for her best interests.

FTR, I'm not doing this to dispute who's bad or who's good in this scenario, I don't doubt J's love for our daughter in the slightest however with her diagnoses BPD and his diagnosed schizophrenia and this social workers call, my concerns are turning into flat our fears.

I've been invited to a meeting with the social worker, B, J and B's mental health practitioner next week, and I'm picking up L on Saturday morning as its my weekend to have with her (Saturday to Monday school run).

I'm seeking advice from a family solicitor and I'm calling citizens advice tomorrow too, but I figure there would be something I could get out of posting this, whether it be advise, comfort or pointing in the right direction.

UPDATE #1 //: So the Child in Need meeting happened, after some reflection I'm frustrated about a few things but we'll get to those.

Two social workers, B's mental health practitioner and a family worker from L's school was present along with J, B myself and my fiancee.

It felt very quick, but ultimately concerns were highlighted that were recorded in the assessment, and then went around the room talking about our feelings. The meeting was focused around mental health support for both B and J, as well as helping them get their home in order and accepting help from their support network.

As mentioned I've been left in increasing frustration following this for a list of reasons;

\- I feel uncomfortable that I wasn't notified by social services that an assessment was being made until I received a call to discuss the concerns and to be invited to the child in need meeting

\- J did not notify me that any of this was happening at all at any point

\- It was made apparent that the school suggested the possibility of L moving to a school closer to home (J or B don't drive so buses being late have been a regular blame for getting to school late)

\-B's attitude was standoffish, almost defensive and evasive. Very evidently just wanted to say the things the professionals wanted to hear

\- I voiced my concern and openly stated that I would quit my career of 15 years in hospitality if necessary to provide a much more active involvement and highlighted my desire to be involved in any choices or even discussions surrounding L's parenting which seemed to be brushed off.

\- In a phone call prior to the meeting with the social worker, I aired some questions I had regarding things mentioned in the assessment and asked if it was okay for me to ask, and even touched on the possibility of me taking L full time which I was told no to and that the meeting is focused on 'positive change' and support, they are not aiming to change living arrangements. My questions were;

1. It's mentioned in the assessment in L's words that 'Mummy and B argue and shout at each other mainly when I come home from daddy's house and daddy rewards me' how does it turn into an argument between the parents when I savour the time I have with my daughter? by extension, what is considered a reward because I am very conscious not to spoil her or give her whatever she wants, we simply do fun activities and she gets a treat here and there.
2. Why have I not been passed all of this information by J voluntarily, even though she's happy to clarify when she will be receiving her maintenance payments every month, and also ask me to buy her a loaf of bread when I'm on the way to pick Sophie up.
3. Why is it I receive passing comments from my daughter in situations when I have her saying 'oh I can do that because B will shout at me' or 'I can't do this activity or trip because B says he doesn't like me doing it'

I feel like I've almost been blocked from taking any action or even raise my own concerns directly, mediation has been offered but I haven't heard anything since I followed up almost immediately after the meeting.

I also mentioned to J over text (whilst she was asking for confirmation of her money and notifying me that it was going up, again) that I had a plan that I was trying to solidify in the spirit of cooperation and the support highlighted in the meeting about increasing the amount of time I have with my daughter in an effort to remedy some of the pressure's that J and B have been dealing with, and that I would tell her the specifics as soon as its actionable as I need to do a lot of footwork with my professional schedule. This was met with 'I think we should discuss this at the next meeting' which is 6 weeks away and I am not happy to wait that long. That plan is simply changing it to a 50/50 time spent with each parent so I can provide a much more active role than every other weekend and one school run without my car, 1 week on 1 week off, there are many co-parents that absolutely succeed with this, including a close friend of mine.

I've spoken to Dad's unlimited and they have given me a lot of information, but ultimately surrounds chasing court orders, that I do have the power/responsibility to remove L from the home if I deem it unsafe and request an urgent child protection order, or mediation which i might be exempt from anyway though a C100 form.

I'm stuck, I'm stressed, anxious and can literally think of nothing else at the moment. Can I maybe just have some peoples opinions on this and if anyone has been through anything remotely similar please comment because I have nobody around me that has been in a similar situation.",1,1748194634.0,FathersRights,0,1.0,False

**Lycaon** (リカオン *Rikaon*) is a marine. His position in the Marines is never stated outright, but he carries out orders directly under a Vice-Admiral and responds to no one else including other Vice-Admirals, suggesting a high position. 

His epithet is **“Phantom Fang”** (幻牙 *Genga*) in reference to his knife wielding style used in conjunction with his Devil Fruit.

Lycaon ate the **Guri Guri no Mi** (グリグリの実 *Guri Guri no Mi*) or Glitch-Glitch Fruit, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create “glitches” around himself — to his own body or weapon of choice, or to surrounding items and other people’s bodies.

———

**Design**

Lycaon is a leanly muscular man in his twenties who possesses tri-colored hair that has black/deep brown, lighter shades of brown and blonde sections with some white tips (similar to the colors of an African wild dog’s coat pattern), sharp coffee brown eyes and a medium-tan complexion. He has light stubble that is visible from some angles.

He dresses primarily in black and doesn’t wear any elements indicating he’s a marine. Because of this choice of dress and him usually being seen loitering about a certain vice-admiral (in the event that he’s seen at all), he has derogatorily been referred to as the vice-admiral’s shadow.

(Lycaon’s overall design, not counting hair color(s), is similar to Nicholas D. Wolfwood from ***Trigun Stampede***, including his light stubble that is only visible from some angles. However, his default design doesn’t include sunglasses and his outfit is different.)

———

**Background**

Lycaon is a former scavenger who used to plunder in the aftermath of pirate attacks on villages and such. Orphaned at a young age, he learned to fend for himself very early in life and to disregard morality in his quest to survive as his survival instincts were what kept him from succumbing to grief over losing his family as a child. 

As a teenager, Lycaon was recruited by a marine vice-admiral who was later shown to be the father of his future leader Orion (the eater of the legendary White Tiger devil fruit). The Vice-Admiral told him that while he was a lowlife no better than a stray dog feeding off trash to survive, what potential he had (having seen Lycaon fight off a band of rogues earlier that day) could be used to give him a shot at something better. This was the first time since the deaths of his parents that another human had shown him anything reminiscent of believing in him, and Lycaon clung on to those words like a starved canine finding a fresh kill for the first time in its life. Lycaon would then go on to train directly under the Vice-Admiral, becoming fiercely and unconditionally loyal to that man and no one else, including other marines of higher rank than himself. 

———

**Character**

Lycaon is quite reserved and outwardly laid-back with a snarky, dry sense of humor.

He shows great respect for Orion’s father and his loyalty to him mirrors that of a loyal dog to its master. However, he shows no regard for anyone else, including other marines higher in rank than him (which very much includes other vice-admirals than Orion’s father, despite them having the same rank as the man he is so fiercely devoted to). Despite respecting the Vice-Admiral so much, Lycaon doesn’t shy away from some light-hearted banter with him even though he follows his orders without objection or question.

Contrasting how fearsome he looks and the ferocity with which he fights, Lycaon is fond of sorbet ice cream and is often spotted with a cup of it when not working (and sometimes even while working, if he’s doing something that doesn’t cost him any effort or if he’s listening to someone he doesn’t respect).

Though initially following Orion’s father’s morality (who in turn seems to subscribe to Fleet Admiral Sakazuki’s Absolute Justice), Lycaon seems to be dispassionate about morality as a whole, only following the Vice-Admiral’s orders and listening to his rants out of loyalty. This changes with his character development as he grows closer to Orion (whom he joined in order to spy on for the Vice-Admiral) and is subjected to the younger marine’s morality and sense of justice. Lycaon eventually grows to follow Orion sincerely and to believe in a equal justice for all, rather than just spying on Orion at the Vice-Admiral’s orders and hollowly going along with whatever morality and justice the Vice-Admiral exclaims as superior.

Despite his normally reserved nature, Lycaon gets fierce and aggressive in battle, and has a high kill count for a marine.

———

**Devil Fruit**

Lycaon ate the **Guri Guri no Mi** (グリグリの実 *Guri Guri no Mi*; “guri” being short for グリッチ *guricchi*, the Japanese pronunciation of the English word “glitch”) or Glitch-Glitch Fruit, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to cause “glitches” around himself — to his own body or weapon of choice, or to surrounding items and other people’s bodies.

Like real-life computer glitches, Lycaon can use his Devil Fruit ability to make items or other people’s bodies or even his own body glitch, which can be utilized in a variety of ways.

When used on others, the glitches will cause a brief “body horror” experience for opponents that will cause psychological damage and throw them off guard to give the user the upper hand.

Lycaon will use the glitches on himself, which makes for a creative and unpredictable way to evade attacks. When used on himself, it is also a way for Lycaon to regain mobility and control of his own body if he were to be paralyzed or petrified. This was shown when Orion lost control of his lightning powers that caused a wave of electricity to wash over a group of marines, paralyzing them, which hit Lycaon as well, and he was able to cause a barely decipherable glitch to his own body and nonchalantly shrugged it off.

Combining the Devil Fruit with a proficiency in aggressive martial arts, Lycaon uses the glitch ability to disturb the movements of opponents to throw them off as if stunning them and easily freeing himself from them.

The Guri Guri no Mi can be used for very small and limited teleportation abilities to “glitch” very short distances, such as in games where a character glitches to another spot. For example, Lycaon can glitch from one side of a person to the other to evade an attack or to sneak an attack of his own. This teleportation ability was originally very difficult to control, but Lycaon has honed it to the point where he can control it down to the centimeter he teleports.

Lycaon uses a dagger in conjunction with his Devil Fruit abilities, using his glitches to extend and bend the blade in unnatural ways, such as warping it so it becomes wavy for a specific technique or bending it to get past a clash with another weapon to directly injure his foe’s body, or extending the blade so that the dagger turns into a weapon more akin to a sword.

Lycaon is very strategic with his Devil Fruit during battle and his impeccable control over his Devil Fruit powers is a reflection of his skill and competence as a warrior and marine.

———

**Non-DF Abilities & Powers**

**Physical Abilities:** Lycaon is remarkably slender for a marine martial artist, and this serves him well with respect to the kind of martial arts he practices and his Devil Fruit powers as his fighting style requires great swiftness and evasiveness to be used most effectively. Despite his slender physique, he is much stronger than he appears, possessing lean muscle and powerful reflexes.

**Martial Arts:** Lycaon uses a knife-wielding martial arts style in conjunction with his glitch-creating Devil Fruit powers. This knife fighting style is a highly aggressive martial art that focuses on creating openings in opponents’ defenses. It is characterized by a fast and aggressive style that focuses on attacking the opponent’s vital areas to quickly incapacitate him or her. His glitches allow him to attack his opponents’ vital areas with great efficiency, complimenting a style that looks for weak spots well since they are so unpredictable.

**Rokushiki:** Lycaon is shown using Kamisori, which is a combination of the Rokushiki techniques Soru and Geppo where Soru is used in a zigzag motion in midair, allowing extremely fast movements in three dimensions.

**Haki**
**Observation Haki:** Lycaon is capable of advanced Observation Haki, as shown in battle as he’s able to foresee his opponents’ moves and use his martial arts and Devil Fruit powers accordingly.
**Armament Haki:** Lycaon is capable of moderate Armament Haki, imbuing the blade of his dagger with it for greater slicing and stabbing power and in order to be able to harm other Devil Fruit users.

**Weapon:** Lycaon uses a combat knife called **Fang** (牙) in his style of martial arts and in conjunction with his Devil Fruit ability. By warping the knife blade with his glitches, he can change its shape, such as turning the straight blade wavy like a kris-style wavy blade or “snake blade”, and length, such as turning the blade longer to resemble a sword or even shorter than its original length to make it more practical to carry or hide. 

———

**Trivia**

Lycaon’s epithet **Phantom Fang** (幻牙 *Genga*) references both his canine motif and his Devil Fruit, with the blade of his dagger Fang being likened to a (canine) fang and the “phantom” part referencing the Glitch-Glitch Fruit allowing him to warp the “fang” as though it were a phantom or an illusion.
**幻** (*gen*) means “phantom”, “illusion”, “dream” or “vision”; **牙** (*ga*) means “fang”.

Lycaon’s penchant for sorbet ice cream is a play on the Japanese name of his Devil Fruit, Guri Guri no Mi, as *guri-guri* is the name of a type of Hawaiian sorbet.

Lycaon is named after the African wild dog (also known as the Lycaon as it is the only non-extinct species under the *Lycaon* genus), a hypercarnivorous wild canine native to sub-Saharan Africa. African wild dogs are both predators and scavengers, reflecting Lycaon’s past before being recruited into the Marines. However, like a dog, Lycaon allowed himself to be “domesticated” under the marine who took him in and was shaped into a fiercely loyal subordinate to that marine and that marine only, like a loyal, domesticated dog.

The knife fighting martial arts practiced by Lycaon is based on arnis/eskrima, a knife-wielding martial arts style from the Philippines with influences from various other martial arts. Arnis knife fighting is a highly aggressive martial art that focuses on creating openings in opponents’ defenses and is one of the most lethal forms of knife combat known to man. It is a hybrid of Filipino martial arts, including other forms of knife fighting like Kuntaw and Silat, and is characterized by a fast and aggressive style that focuses on attacking the opponent’s vital areas to quickly incapacitate him or her. 
One of the influences of arnis is capoeira, an Afro-Brazilian martial art that includes elements of dance and acrobatics; such elements can be detected in Lycaon’s extremely swift and (with the exception of his glitches) fluid fighting style as well.

Never really posted anything like this online before and nobody I know has really been through anything like this so I wanted to just see if I could get some advice from the masses whilst I also get advice from family solicitors etc.

I received a call today from a social worker saying they have already done a home visit and spoken to my daughter (lets call her L) about her environment at home, this is all following a noise complaint from my ex-wife's (J) neighbour about her boyfriend (B) who has lived there full time for about 4/5 years screaming at 'the children' (they have a son together too).

For context, J and I's break up was ugly but eventually developed into a real effort to co-parent from both sides which I was really happy with and working really hard towards, a few years back I received messages from one of J's friends with screenshots of complaints about her boyfriend, use of drugs (never confirmed whether it was in the children's presence or not) and evidence of behaviour that was concerning at the least.

I went to J and we came to an agreement that L would stay with me until we could have a serious conversation about this and it came to light that B had some underlying mental health problems that he was medicated AND self medicating for (weed) and that it was all under control and they remained under a close eye from me for about a year following that, social services were never involved, although they were a very real threat.

Snap to today, I'm remembering that L is coming to me (she stays with me every other weekend) slightly dirty every now and, nails left uncut for a decent amount of time etc. Since she has told the social worker that she has to look after her little brother, she has to make J and B coffee using a coffee machine, she has to remind mummy that she needs to brush her teeth and she also needs to wake mummy up to take her to school.

She is also at a school attendance of 74% and when I was raised with the attitude that I literally have to be bleeding out or hospitalised to miss a day of school that horrifies me too haha.

My daughter is 7 years old and I currently feel nothing but sick and horrified having potentially overlooked something obvious. I have a home for her, there is no space or financial issues if she were to come and live with me full time and I am aware that because I am on the birth certificate and we were married that there will be no dispute about my parental responsibility, I am also aware that I can remove L from any situation that I deem unsafe for her best interests.

FTR, I'm not doing this to dispute who's bad or who's good in this scenario, I don't doubt J's love for our daughter in the slightest however with her diagnoses BPD and his diagnosed schizophrenia and this social workers call, my concerns are turning into flat our fears.

I've been invited to a meeting with the social worker, B, J and B's mental health practitioner next week, and I'm picking up L on Saturday morning as its my weekend to have with her (Saturday to Monday school run).

I'm seeking advice from a family solicitor and I'm calling citizens advice tomorrow too, but I figure there would be something I could get out of posting this, whether it be advise, comfort or pointing in the right direction.

//EDIT - My question really is how do I best navigate this situation, do I chase for full custody? Removal of B from the household? There are so many ways I can go about it and some of them are really quick, others are a lengthy and drawn out process

3. Why is it I receive passing comments from my daughter in situations when I have her saying 'oh I can do that because B will shout at me' or 'I can't do this activity or trip because B says he doesn't like me doing it'

I feel like I've almost been blocked from taking any action or even raise my own concerns directly, mediation has been offered but I haven't heard anything since I followed up almost immediately after the meeting.

I also mentioned to J over text (whilst she was asking for confirmation of her money and notifying me that it was going up, again) that I had a plan that I was trying to solidify in the spirit of cooperation and the support highlighted in the meeting about increasing the amount of time I have with my daughter in an effort to remedy some of the pressure's that J and B have been dealing with, and that I would tell her the specifics as soon as its actionable as I need to do a lot of footwork with my professional schedule.

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome. Been playing the new Doom game. Down for teaming up. 

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.

Hmm how I would describe myself? Black hair. Beard. Brown eyes. Dad bod. Hairy. I've been told I had nice eye lashes. I'm cultivating mass so I can destroy my enemies in the buffet line. 

Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I mainly listen to rock and metal. But I do on occasion listen to the Macarena and Barbie girl as I shower or cook. Zeppelin, the doors and a myriad of other classic bands are always playing.

They’ve been inseparable besties their whole lives, minus a few awkward moments. About a year ago now, our neighbor across the way got a cat that they allowed to wander outside. The cat came into my patio while my girl was looking out the window and caused her to become aggressive, she turned around and took it out on her brother, acting like she didn’t know him anymore at first. They both got fluffy, we separated them for as long we could and things seem okay after for the most part. 
    
    
Queue “the issue…” Sometimes while we are asleep or when I step outside to smoke for a few minutes in the morning, Pluto (male) will chase and corner Nova under the coffee table. She growls, hisses and eventually screams when he doesn’t back off. Pluto always runs away when I enter the room, while Nova sits in shock under the table. I put him in the bedroom to let them cool off but I can’t separate them for long because they both end up at the door meowing for each other. This usually happens between the early hours while we’re sleeping and like 8am, after that they’re usually fine all day with no issues… Sometimes Nova will growl at Pluto but they always cuddle together in one of the trees, they lick each other, they love each other. I am so confused and frustrated with this situation. 
    
    
The family with the cat moved out months ago, my window is covered by a film they can’t see through and they are both healthy cats. They have multiple cat trees, multiple hiding spots, multiple food spots, toys everywhere, catnip play time, etc. we do only have one water fountain and litter box because we live in a small apartment but they’ve shared their whole lives with no issues until recently. The only change to our apartment was a new couch. It is definitely too big and only allows one small opening on the floor, although the cats jump up and over all over it when they need to. The coffee table is close to that small opening and is where most of the fights take place. Could the couch the problem? 
    
Pluto is pretty much always the aggressor. He will follow her around and doesn’t listen when she growls or hisses at him, I usually have to intervene. But while Nova is acting like she doesn’t want him near her, she immediately runs after him when he’s told to leave her alone. They’ll follow each other around doing this awkward dance for awhile, until they find a new toy to play with or one comes to cuddle with us. Sometimes while they’re cuddling up in one of the cat trees, they will wake up and hiss at each other and then fall back asleep after I make some kissy noises at them and tell them they’re okay.

1kv8208,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/1kv8208/sick_of_cramps_ruining_my_rides_please_help/,Sick of Cramps Ruining my Rides - Please help!,"Hey all, I've been having some really bad issues with cramping in my legs recently which totally kills the session for me (and anyone who is relying on me for a lift home!). 

Little background, I come from BMX, been on a bike all my life really, then got a hardtail and started MTB many years ago before getting a full suspension. I mainly used to ride enduro stuff, red/black/off-piste trails with a lot of climbing. Never suffered with cramp before.  As I got more experience I started riding more downhill grade tracks, got a more downhill-focused bike and just rode bike parks with uplifts. 

A few years went by of riding with no cramping issues.  One day I went for a ride at the bike park as normal, started getting awful cramp in my left knee about halfway in the day, first time I ever had it, but I was able to stretch it out etc.   This cramp then became a recurring thing every time I rode, always in the exact spot just above my left knee, but it only kicked in when descending. I could ride on flat or climb hills and never have the cramp. I only felt it when standing up, which quickly forced me to sit down (sitting down on downhill tracks is not fun let me tell you :D)

I then took a year off because we had our first child, I changed jobs, basically life got in the way. But I saw this as a good opportunity to heal my knee, assuming it was an injury.  In my gap year I decided to fit clipless pedals as a friend of mine who had very similar problems, said his was basically down to foot position - I have pins in my left leg and ankle, and always thought my left foot sat slightly off-centre because of the previous fracture, so it made sense to me to try clipless, basically forcing my foot into the 'correct' position every time. 

Today I went for my first ride after the having a year off, first time on the new pedals, took it nice and easy doing an Enduro day on some reds, nothing crazy.  Thankfully, the cramp in my knee has gone, BUT now the cramp is higher up in BOTH legs, right in the middle of my thighs/quads.  I could literally see my muscle spasm and lock up, it was bloody painful and I had no choice but to take the fire road back to the van and call it a day.

I feel like I prepped well in terms of food/drink for a morning ride... for breakfast I had a big bowl of porridge with some bananas and a small coffee. Then a bottle of water on the drive there and a large flapjack.  Whilst riding I had a Lucozade Sport drink (usually I just have water with electrolyte tablets), another 2 bananas, some Wine Gums and a couple of energy gummies.  I also had half a can of Monster when we were back at the van for a rest but usually I avoid Monster/Red Bull etc. 

  
My thoughts are my shoes need adjusting for the new pedals and my foot position might not be right, despite it 'fixing' the cramp in my knee, maybe my foot placement has shifted the cramp further up my legs.  

My main query here is if anyone else has experienced the same cramping after moving to clipless pedals, could this just be some adjustments I need to make to my stance/cleats to dial things in?  Or is this sounding more like lack of fitness (after a year off the bike) or nutrition?  Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated - I don't want this to be the end of riding for me.

Here’s what to expect:

A relaxed meetup in a public spot (we’ll decide together)

Good food or coffee

Great vibes and easygoing people

Zero awkwardness — everyone’s here to meet new faces!

Interested? Just send me your Instagram via private message and I’ll add you to a group chat where we’ll agree on the date, time, and place together.

Imagine coming home with 5–6 videos, each about 12 minutes long, and having to wait over an hour just to render telemetry overlays. No one’s going to sit through 60 minutes of coffee-ride footage unless it’s an intense and exciting race.

So I built a solution: a **browser-based video editor** that lets you trim your videos right in the browser, arrange telemetry gauges, and upload only the trimmed parts for processing. You can rotate the video or turn it vertical - handy since camera is usually mounted upside down. Once you arrange the gauges, the layout is saved, so next time, you just trim and hit ""Submit."" In 10–15 minutes, you’ll receive a link to the final video in your email.

**How I solved the time synchronization problem:**

* If the video has a timecode in its metadata that overlaps with your activity, we use that by default.
* For GoPro footage with GPS enabled, we use the GPS timecode.
* If there’s no metadata, we can align the video on the timeline manually by comparing it with the image from Google Street View
* A Computer Vision algorithm for automatic video-to-track matching is currently in development. It will be especially useful for videos with out-of-sync metadata or already edited footage

Once the processed video is ready, I provide the user with a download link and delete all data from the server within 1 week.

One time we even ended up on the same journey home together and I'm pretty sure he hid just to avoid me. Anyway, some time passed and in an effort to figure out if I had a crush or just imagining things. I reached out by text. We spoke for a week or two. Nothing crazy just banter. I was being flirty and he was responding to that but it was very confusing because he'd take a while to reply, but always engaged when he did. He started greeting me, orbiting me and I'd catch him staring at me in class. Seeing that I wasn't going to find any sort of clarity there I decided to make plans to see each other outside of class. He seemed VERY enthusiastic about the outing before and after planning it. A few hours before, I texted him something overtly flirty to see if we were on the same page and to that he was responsive and even mentioned wanting to see me sooner and extending the outing, if he could. felt like a field trip.

Still confused about what was happening, I decided to reach out and come clean.

""I like you""

I sent that knowing he would be busy and was unlikely to reply immediately. When he did reply, he told me he thought I was great but he was seeing someone. Fine, moving on.

Tender as in, it was innocent for the most part. I had left something at his place and chased him for a while to get it back. Before this though, we had established that this wasn't something we were looking to explore, and I believe we both meant that. We had mentioned it would be a one night thing. It was all good, exactly what we both needed in the moment I think. However, I reached out and said that being that I never have and will never again do something like that, I didn't want my only one night story to feel so unfinished as it ended abruptly -- I had other places to be.

He understood and proposed we go out for coffee. He would let me know when he was free.I got inpatient and reached out to just go get what I had forgotten and it juts became very cold afterwards. Its been almost two weeks and there's been no contact at all, he doesn't even look at things I sometimes post on social media.

We were having dinner and my father suddenly took the iced coffee I bought (it's specifically a ""me"" coffee, btw, if that matters. nobody else drinks white choco in the house so I very obviously bought it for myself. and it's a singular can of coffee. I have no idea what possessed him to go for a drink he never prefers while there is other drinks he likes, we have _bottles of_ soda and juice.) from the fridge. He was about to open the can and pour it in a cup and then I said ""Is that my coffee?"" 

He looked at me weird and replied ""You can go buy it again.""

I said ""But I bought it already.""

I truly was not going to tell him to not drink that and put it back, all I expected was a ""Yeah it's the one you got, can I drink it though?"" and I would've let him drink it. I know he loves cold drinks on a very hot day and I love my father, and I bought it with his money, and we literally live next to a market. So it's not that I was gonna gatekeep, all I expected was him to ask just out of courtesy or even give me a heads up as he was taking it from the fridge. Not asking before taking things even though you know the person will let you take it anyway is rude, and that's what _he_ taught me as a child. 😵‍💫 My parents would not let me get away with it if I was the one who did it.

He got very disproportionately angry. He started yelling, he even told me how bad he wants to hit me and flip the entire kitchen over. I tried to explain myself but he was so angry that I just shut up after an attempt. 

My mom and sister took his side and I was called selfish lol. 

His behavior irritated me especially because I never eat or drink the things they buy for themselves without asking them. And even then, I very rarely ask to consume their things anyway. We don't have a strict ""mine is mine and yours is yours"" policy in the house, but there's still a line that they hate when I (used to) cross, and I think that it's still rude to just... do whatever you want? Was it really wrong or selfish of me to expect the same courtesy I show them to be shown to me?

And even though it's a very simple matter, there's actually a few layers to it. So to give some background info, my sister and I have a past of not being able to share things properly since our childhood. When I used to eat her things my parents would scold me very harshly. I'm talking about half an hour on average of scolding, yelling on top of their lungs, calling me names, and punishing me. When she was the one who did the same thing, she was never scolded like I was, all she got was a plain ""don't do that next time"".

I was always labeled as the selfish child and it basically stuck on me. Now I automatically get called selfish at any situation similar to this no matter the context. All for a habit I had when I was a _child,_ mind you. I'm 19 now, I know better, but everybody acts like I still have the same personality when I was 12. It's almost like a dysfunctional family cycle at this point

And if the situation was reversed and I was the one who randomly took my sister's drink today they would 100% take turns to yell at me. Like we have been through this lol. They aren't being fair AT ALL. I don't think my father would've yelled at me if I took his drink like that but he definitely would've made a comment about it just like I initially did.

For example, they will visit a baptism in a Catholic church, behave well during mass but then start their talk at the coffee table.

""Why can't they make it ecumenical?""
""I can't help if they're doing this shit to me (SIL was upset that the credo contained the catholic church and not, as Lutheran say, the christian church)""
""The priest looks ugly and dissatisfied with life""
""Why did you have to baptize them in the catholic church? The dad is protestant!""

They are not even practicing in their lutheran faith, just cultural christians who do the usual christmas and baptism things. I could have avoided this by marrying a Catholic, I know.
But I wasn't that religious when I married. Too late now. My husband is really tolerant and on board with raising kids catholic. Now I'm afraid to invite the in laws to our future babies' baptisms and communions because I have to sit next to them at the coffee table and they have no filter. I always say nothing and sadness fills me.

1kv7ki5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1kv7ki5/my_narcissistic_ex_completely_broke_me/,My narcissistic ex completely broke me.,"I've already talked to a few ppl about this, and I'm in therapy, but everything just seems so hard and I have so much trauma. My ex broke up with me around January this year and it's been 4 months since then. How everything went down during the break up just really broke me and it was very messed up. 

My ex basically in the end started being very abusive towards me, emotionally and mentally, and when I wasn't just gonna take it I left and she blocked me on social media's, and also turned the friends I made while dating her( we had the same friend group), against me.

What basically lead to the break up was because shes a trans woman and she had been voice training here and there and was trying to to do it more, and she had always said how *if ppl tell me they like how my voice currently is, what's the point in even voice training* and so I didn't wanna tell her I didn't like. How it currently sounded, but when I did tell her, at first she said how it only made her wanna voice train more and then after that things just took a turn and I don't understand what even happened. 

She also ofc wanted space bc of this , which I gave her but ofc it was driving me crazy not talking to her and when I said how I. Couldn't handle not talking to her bc she was my gf and we talked everyday.. She called me selfish. 

 Now anyone new I meet or makes friends with, I'm so scared they're just gonna leave me too, and I'm. Especially scared of even dating someone again. She basically made it seem like everything was my fault, like I'm why the relationship failed, while having major red flags herself. Such as she would always judge me for anything that I liked, such as my taste in music( while in the same breath would be scared to show me music she liked bc she was scared I would be the one to judge, WHEN IT WAS HER ALL ALONG. She also judged me bc I like coffee and the type of cosmetics I would get in a game called dead by daylight.

 She even said how one day because she saw me listening to a Justin Bieber song, how she didn't know what to think of me and that ofc made me never even wanna listen to the song around her again. She would do stuff like this but then get upset when I wouldn't be open with her. Another huge red flag was her almost breaking up my best friend and I. ( our friendship) .

My best friend came back wanting to fix our relationship, while I was dating my ex and apparently I was too excited ( sorry but I gen missed my best friend) , and she started to get really jealous of my friend and thought something was going on between us no matter how many times I told her there wasn't anything at all. Plus I've know this person since 2022 , so if something were to happen between us, it wouldve by now. We had a server, my ex and ex friend group, and when I invited my best friend, my ex was just so rude towards her, for no reason like she didn't even try to go get her a chance.

 That's what I hated about my ex, when she really hated someone she would just treat them really awful ( which fair I guess) . There were also a lot of red flags even before we started dating one being how in the talking stages, I said how I was mixed with Cuban, Indian, and black, and instead of saying something like *oh that's cool* , she told me *do you know how many ways I can be racists towards you* like sorry but who tf says that???

 She would also just get really upset over video games, like when we would play dead by daylight together and some of the stuff she would say, which made the game so unenjoyable. Like basically one time a teammate got her killed and she was so. Upset that she kind of threatened to have ppl be sent to that persons house to have some things done to them.

Also a *friend* who was in the friend group kept going to my ex and showing our texts messages which ofc just made my ex even more upset bc apparently she thought I was being fake towards her bc in the texts all I was literally doing was just venting to a friend about her, which is normal. 

 She also made other stuff I gen enjoyed doing with her souunenjoyable, such asThaig girl love shows we watch together, saying how in one show she wanted to k*ll a couple characters bc she didn't like how the show was, and she was dead serious.

 My ex friend was also very leery of her, bc how she would react towards stuff. Yet she stuck around. And I just still feel like everything was my fault and I'm an awful person. ",2,1748192918.0,relationships_advice,7,1.0,False

Let’s say hypothetically—you’re the janitor’s nephew at Blizzard HQ. You sneak into the balance team meetings when they leave the room for 3 minutes and a lukewarm coffee.

Which one do you change? And how?

My pick: Illidan’s Level 16 - Fiery Brand
You know, the one that’s supposed to be his Giant Killer but instead hits like a wet noodle unless you're hitting a raid boss with 10k+ HP and no CC.

Let’s be real—it’s 2025. Fiery Brand’s still out here doing less damage than a tickle from Murky. This talent needs to be escorted into retirement and replaced with something that doesn’t make you question your life choices after picking it.

Suggested Replacement:
Something for his evasion – Every time Illidan activates Evasion, he becomes immune to blinds (lore accurate no?), and basic attacks during Evasion extend its duration by 0.5s (up to 2s max).

Because if I’m gonna press E, I wanna feel like I just activated anime plot armor.

Or something for his trait? Trait becomes activateable and his attacks cleave or do spell dmg?

A brand new spell altogether whilst maintaing lore accuracy? (Mana burn mechanic?)

Amy and I went to university together, she was a year below me and we became friends after her ex-friend group kicked her out. I’ve always had a soft spot for the outsiders, being one myself. Anyway fast forward and Amy and I have become good friends. It also helped that our younger sisters were good friends too. We spent a lot of time together both on and off campus, she had dinners at my house and sleepovers, etc. but she never invited me over in all the time I knew her. I became her lift to and sometimes from uni as she didn’t have a car and her house (albeit slightly off the path) was along my way in. I was a bursary funded student and worked part time at a restaurant to cover my expenses and petrol to and from uni. In all my time driving Amy to campus she never once offered to put petrol in. The drive to campus was about 45 mins in my old car and as you can imagine it chewed up petrol very fast. I never said anything because I’m very shy and struggle a lot with setting boundaries in friendships. I also felt bad because I knew Amy was studying on a bursary, however she also had a part time job. Every time I would ask her to put petrol in she would say yes and then we would get to the petrol station and she would just start up a random conversation or be staring down at her phone when it came time to pay. 
On top of that we would often go out and I, being a girls girl, would offer her a lift home so I could make sure she was safe. She never offered to buy me a drink or a coffee or movie ticket in exchange for driving her around. 
I’ve also lent her multiple items of clothing and given her many beloved pieces which I no longer wore. 
At one of my parties she was cold and asked to borrow a sweater, she chose one my mum had bought me a couple years earlier, one that I cherished. After my party she left with the sweater and promised to return it on our next visit. It’s now been well over a year of me asking for it back and every time I do she says she gave it back already and that she’s checked multiple times and it’s not there. I’ve checked my apartment multiple times over and it is not here, she has not returned it to me to this day.

Recently I lent her my old phone when hers broke, one that I’ve been keeping in case of an emergency. When I gave it to her she took the phone out of the case and proceeded to have it without a case the entire time she had it which felt very disrespectful. When I asked for it back she made me come and fetch it too. Never offering to buy it (I would have given it to her for free, I just wanted it to feel like she was grateful for it..) when she eventually made time for me to come and fetch it, she wasn’t even home to give it to me. Tbh the whole thing just felt very hurtful. 

Anyways

Fast forward a couple years and Amy has a new job, one that clearly pays well. I keep seeing her buying new expensive clothing and gadgets and overall living like she’s making 6 figures. She’s never once offered to take me out for coffee (something I paid for too when she was very broke) or made a plan to come and visit me (without making me be the uber again). We caught an uber last year which she insisted me we would split even though she’d asked me to come with her to run errands (wherein she spent a lot of money). 

I just honestly feel hurt but at the same time I’m scared that I’m just being overly sensitive and unreasonable. So AITA for wanting to send her a bill after all these years..? ",4,1748192750.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

I’m a 46-year-old woman living in Canada. I’ve got work I enjoy, hobbies that keep me curious, and a day-to-day that’s mostly full. Still, I’ve been feeling the pull for something more… the kind of connection that comes from meaningful conversations, the kind that aren’t rushed or surface-level. I miss the kind of chats where you lose track of time and maybe accidentally solve the meaning of life. 

I love music, photography, history, and travel. A little bit of everything, really. I collect interests like other people collect coffee mugs. I’m curious by nature, always up for a thoughtful exchange and think tangents are wildly underrated.

I’d like to connect with another woman. There’s often a shared understanding that makes talking easier and more natural. I’m not looking for anything overly intense. What I’m really after is a sincere connection through words. 

If that sounds like your kind of thing, I want to hear from you.",1,1748192484.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

I’m not quite sure how to explain this without sounding braggy. Basically, I’ve heard some version of, “You have the Spirit,” at different points in my life. One time, I was just walking around campus at college, and someone came up to me and said, “You look very spiritual,” (he proceeded to try to sell me a book while I was late to class). Then, a Disciples of Christ preacher came up to me at church after I had sang and said, “I could see the Spirit all around you.” Another time, my church’s new sexton said, “There’s something special about Levi. I could just tell.” And then, someone at coffee hour said to me, “I knew you were special from the first time I saw you. You have the Spirit all around you.”

First off, why me? Outside of church, I’m a bit of a sexual deviant (nothing illegal but I digress). I’ve failed to stick to a Bible reading plan many times. I accidentally scowl or act rude to people all the time. How can I appear like I have the Spirit?

Secondly, how do I respond to this besides an awkward thank you? And how do I use this “gift”? How do I share this without being arrogant or self righteous ",2,1748192425.0,Episcopalian,1,0.67,False

However, I find comfort in how slow it is.

 It almost feels like a slice of life film at times. For instance, that scene where Alice is making instant coffee, I know it wasn't really necessary; but it feels like we get a peak at these characters routines. Also, I do like that Alice didn't put the lid on the jar properly, it was crooked. I'm sure that wasn't intentional, but it makes the character feel like a real person. 

It's a nice escape from real life. I wouldn't say my life is bad per say, I just struggle with things that normal people take for granted. Oh well, this is why we watch movies, to escape from real life. 

Plus, this has a young Kevin Bacon, this being his fifth acting credit. I don't know, I just find comfort in this movie. 

How about you guys, do you feel similar?

Eileen Curtis rose from the bed of the CEO's lounge, gathering the shirt and short skirt strewn across the floor, putting them on swiftly.  
  
As she dressed, a seductive charm lingered in her eyes, her gaze met his cold expression.  
  
Bryan Dawson, the CEO of Apex Group, her boss, and her benefactor.  
  
Their secret relationship was confined to this very lounge. Beyond these walls, she was nothing more than his special assistant.  
  
""Mr. Dawson, if there's nothing more, I'll return to my duties,"" Eileen said, offering a practiced smile.  
  
As she spoke, she deftly arranged her long hair into a bun, her appearance swiftly transitioning from enticing to strictly professional.  
  
It almost seemed like she hadn't just been intimate with him.  
  
Bryan narrowed his eyes, his gaze lingering on her delicate face.  
  
Eileen had reached the door of the lounge, hand poised to open it, when Bryan's words stopped her in her tracks.  
  
""Vivian is back.""  
  
Her body stiffened, and the color drained from her face, even her breathing momentarily halted.  
  
Bryan's first love, Vivian Warren, for whom he had waited for six years, had returned. In his life, she had been nothing more than a means to satisfy his needs.  
  
Despite the fact that his presence had been her sole source of support over the past two years, she was acutely aware that she only truly had him to herself in those intimate moments.  
  
Besides being his assistant and lover, she held another role in Bryan's life-his wife.  
  
Six years ago, her mother had been diagnosed with cancer and needed urgent, costly treatment. Newly graduated and financially incapable, she had been desperate until the Dawson family's donation had come to her aid, an act of kindness she would never forget.  
  
Later, when Bryan's fiancée, Vivian, had left him and moved abroad, it had led to widespread gossip and ridicule.  
  
At that time, Bryan had needed a wife to save face. His grandmother had found Eileen, who had agreed to marry Bryan to repay the favor.  
  
Grateful for the Dawson family's help, Eileen had faithfully played her part as Bryan's wife, asking for nothing more.  
  
After the marriage, needing to continue paying for her mother's treatment, she had left a small company and joined Apex Group, hoping for better opportunities.  
  
It was only then that she discovered Apex Group's CEO was Bryan, her husband, whom she had met only once on their wedding day and who hadn't recognized her since.  
  
Determined to secure funds for her mother's ongoing medical treatments, Eileen stayed with the company, avoiding Bryan as much as possible. Fate, however, had other plans, and she had found herself sleeping with a drunken Bryan one night. Following this unintended encounter, Bryan had unexpectedly promoted her to be his special assistant.  
  
Satisfied with her company, Bryan had forced her to sleep with him multiple times, eventually making her his sex partner.  
  
Whenever he summoned her, she would comply. At times, he would inquire if she needed anything, and during financially tough moments, she would ask for money openly.  
  
But when she didn't require financial assistance, she would decline his advances, striving to preserve some semblance of dignity in their interactions, resisting the reduction of their relationship to mere transactions.  
  
Eileen had considered ending this kind of relationship with Bryan many times, but the steep costs of her mother's treatment had forced her to set aside her pride.  
  
Moreover, she had fallen in love with Bryan.  
  
Feeling unworthy of Bryan, she concealed her feelings, dedicating herself to supporting him at work.  
  
But now, Vivian had returned.  
  
Whether as Bryan's assistant or his wife, Eileen knew she had to step aside.  
  
The realization that neither of her roles could compete with his first love was truly saddening.  
  
However, she quickly regained her composure and turned around, maintaining her well-measured smile.  
  
""Understood, Mr. Dawson. I will not step into this room again,"" she said.  
  
Bryan rose from the bed, indifferent to his state of nakedness. He found his pants on the floor and put it on.  
  
""What does this have to do with you?"" he asked with a chuckle, handing her his shirt, which she began to help him into.  
  
As she buttoned his shirt, his voice came from above. ""Draft a divorce agreement for me.""  
  
Eileen paused, her gaze lifting to his face, taking in the sharp lines of his jaw and his thin lips.  
  
""She has wasted six years of her life on me. It's time to put an end to it,"" he stated, handing her his tie, breaking her from her thoughts. ""What do you think?""  
  
Without a word, Eileen took the tie, her heart a tumult of emotions.  
  
A bitter smile suddenly crossed Eileen's lips.  
  
Noticing this, Bryan furrowed his brow in confusion. ""Why are you smiling?"" he asked.  
  
Eileen adjusted his tie and stood on her toes to smooth out his collar.  
  
""I'm simply happy for you, Mr. Dawson. The woman you cherish is finally back,"" she said.  
  
Taking a deep breath, she stepped back and nodded slightly. ""I'll go draft the divorce agreement now.""  
  
Bryan frowned, feeling a flicker of annoyance somehow. ""You're such an exemplary assistant, Eileen,"" he remarked.  
  
Her detachment made him question his charm.  
  
Eileen merely offered a smile, dismissing the underlying message in his compliment. ""Thank you for acknowledging my work, Mr. Dawson.""  
  
As she turned to leave, Bryan's voice halted her once more. ""Give her twenty million,"" he said.  
  
Eileen paused for a moment and then said, ""But the agreement was quite clear that she would leave with nothing upon the divorce-""  
  
Bryan interjected, ""After all, that's six years of her life. And she seemed to be having a difficult time back then. Just go and get it done soon.""  
  
After issuing his instructions, Bryan left the lounge.  
  
Seated at his desk, he reminisced about the timid young woman he had met six years ago at the entrance to City Hall.  
  
At that time, he had felt a deep resentment towards his family for forcing him into marriage and had borne no affection towards the woman they had selected to be his wife. As a result, he had never met her again after marriage.  
  
To his surprise, during the ensuing six years, his wife had never once asked him or the Dawson family for anything.  
  
In this aspect, she reminded him of Eileen.  
  
Consequently, his perception of his wife had significantly improved, leading him to want to give her a divorce settlement of twenty million dollars.  
  
Eileen soon finished preparing the divorce agreement and sent it over to Bryan. With his approval, she printed it out.  
  
Later, Bryan and Eileen headed to the airport to pick up Vivian.  
  
At the bustling airport, young folks were clinging to their moments together, while travelers in pairs radiated excitement for the journeys ahead.  
  
Amidst the crowd, Bryan and Eileen stood out.  
  
Bryan, dressed in an exquisitely tailored suit, possessed sharply defined features and a presence that commanded attention.  
  
His lips were slightly pressed together, and his deep eyes displayed a touch of impatience as he watched the arrival gate.  
  
Standing next to him, Eileen, appeared delicate and poised. Her long hair fell loosely around her shoulders, and a light application of makeup enhanced her features. She had dressed up with care, knowing he would want her company to the airport.  
  
Not knowing why and understanding it might be pointless, she had made the effort nonetheless.  
  
The look of surprise in Bryan's eyes upon seeing her earlier had been worth it, especially when he had casually remarked, ""You look better than in your work attire.""  
  
It had significantly lifted her spirits.  
  
Suddenly, a large group of people emerged from the arrival gate. Eileen's gaze darted among the crowd, scrutinizing every woman.  
  
A woman in a floral dress, her long hair dyed a light shade of purple and styled in waves, came into view wearing sunglasses. She pushed her suitcase while walking.  
  
Eileen sensed the woman's gaze, even behind those lenses, fixed on Bryan.  
  
True to Eileen's intuition, the woman rushed towards Bryan the next moment, her suitcase getting flung aside as she threw herself into his arms.  
  
Vivian, unbothered by her suitcase, clung to Bryan, her voice soft and sweet. ""Bryan, I'm back. I'm sorry...""  
  
Eileen, witnessing their embrace, felt her mood, previously great, plummet in an instant.  
  
She turned to retrieve Vivian's suitcase, taking a deep breath to compose herself.  
  
The suitcase had traveled a considerable distance, necessitating her to navigate through the bustling crowd, which left her looking slightly awkward.  
  
Once she retrieved the suitcase and returned, she paused a few steps away from Bryan and Vivian, uncertain whether to approach.  
  
Bryan's hand was on Vivian's waist as Vivian clung to him, her demeanor suggesting he was her entire world.  
  
The longing and affection that enveloped Vivian made it increasingly difficult for Eileen to maintain her composure.  
  
The realization that the man she had been intimate with just in the morning was now embracing another woman felt suffocating.  
  
The lipstick she had intentionally applied hid her paleness, concealing her overwhelming desolation.  
  
""Bryan, I've missed you so much. Did you miss me?"" Vivian loosened her grip from around Bryan's neck but kept her hands on his shoulders, their intimacy undeniable.  
  
Compared to Vivian, Eileen's earlier presence beside Bryan seemed less fitting.  
  
Her own attire was a stark contrast to Vivian's, and she could never be this affectionate with someone in public.  
  
""I did,"" Bryan uttered softly. His eyes briefly met Eileen's, who stood not too far away.  
  
She seemed less poised than usual, though he couldn't quite discern what was amiss. He frowned slightly.  
  
Vivian's eyes reddened as she gazed at Bryan, her voice laden with remorse. ""Bryan, I will make it up to you now that I'm back.""  
  
""It's getting late. Let's head back,"" Bryan said, his eyes mirroring her regret and self-blame.  
  
Eileen had mentally prepared herself for a while, now wearing a professional smile.  
  
""Mr. Dawson, Miss Warren, this way, please,"" she said.  
  
Bryan led the way, saying, ""Let's go."" Eileen, suitcase in hand, trailed behind him, her stride over the years having adjusted to his quick pace.  
  
She was able to keep up with Bryan, but Vivian struggled, her high heels clacking as she hurried to keep pace with Eileen.  
  
""Are you Bryan's assistant?"" Vivian asked, slightly breathless.  
  
Eileen gave a slight nod. ""Yes.""  
  
""Then you must be very capable. We seem to be about the same age. Let's be friends. I'll add you on WhatsApp later,"" Vivian said.  
  
  
Chapter2 Are You Rejecting Me?  
Vivian smiled, her face adorned with two dimples.  
  
Surprise took hold of Eileen. The thought had not crossed her mind that Vivian might see value in her professional abilities, enough to forge a friendship.  
  
Yet, the motive behind Vivian's offer puzzled Eileen.  
  
Seeing Eileen's hesitation, Vivian asked, ""Are you unwilling to do it?""  
  
""Oh, of course not."" Eileen, masking her reluctance with a courteous smile, retrieved her phone. ""I'll add you now,"" she said, seeing no valid reason to object.  
  
Vivian quickly tapped on WhatsApp, and they quickly added each other as contacts.  
  
Before Vivian could say more, Eileen noticed Bryan's absence. She reminded Vivian, saying, ""We shouldn't keep Mr. Dawson waiting. Let's head out now.""  
  
""Alright,"" Vivian agreed, then started walking with a quick pace.  
  
The streets were nearly empty at midnight as they got into the black Benz.  
  
Bryan and Vivian took their seats in the back, while Eileen took the driver's seat.  
  
Eileen's gaze was fixed on the road ahead, though her focus wavered. The soft murmurs from Bryan and Vivian filled her ears.  
  
They sounded like a couple who adored each other with passion.  
  
Hearing them talk was reassuring for Eileen; it meant they were simply talking, nothing more.  
  
But after a brief silence, Eileen suddenly considered the possibility that Bryan and Vivian might be kissing.  
  
She glanced at the rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of the backseat.  
  
Bryan appeared cheerful, his smile evident as he sat with his fingers entwined over his crossed legs.  
  
Vivian was leaning in his direction, nearly closing the gap between them as if she wished to be in his embrace.  
  
It seemed they had paused their conversation, possibly lost in a shared past memory.  
  
Before Eileen could think any further, she met Bryan's gaze.  
  
His eyes were enchanting, and she quickly looked away.  
  
Clearing her throat, Eileen said, ""We'll reach the Warren family's residence soon, Mr. Dawson. Do you prefer I drive through or stop at the entrance?""  
  
She immediately regretted her rushed question.  
  
The Warren family's home was in Sunrise Villas, and there was a significant walk from the gate to the closest villa. Eileen doubted Bryan would want Vivian to make that walk with her luggage.  
  
""Bryan, why are you dropping me off at my home?"" Vivian suddenly realized they were reaching her family's residence. She bit her lip and voiced her reluctance. ""I don't want to go home yet.""  
  
""You haven't been back in years. It's time for a family reunion,"" Bryan said. Then, he looked Eileen in the eye and said, ""Stop at the gate.""  
  
A heavy silence enveloped the car.  
  
Once they had stopped, Eileen exited the car swiftly and opened the back door.  
  
""We've arrived, Mr. Dawson, Ms. Warren,"" she announced before heading to retrieve Vivian's suitcase from the trunk. As she did, she noticed a figure approaching.  
  
Clad in a set of sportswear, the man moved towards them under the moon's glow.  
  
Kian Warren, who was two years Bryan's senior, managed the Warren family's affairs and was well-known in Onaland.  
  
He and Bryan's frequent meetings meant Eileen often encountered Kian.  
  
His gentle demeanor and charming gaze lent him the air of a playboy.  
  
However, Eileen was aware of the danger he posed to those who crossed him. He was far from harmless.  
  
Vivian, as his cherished younger sister, held a special place in the Warren family.  
  
Eileen greeted him, ""Hello, Mr. Warren.""  
  
Acknowledging Eileen with a nod, Kian embraced Vivian warmly.  
  
""You were away for six long years. Aren't you happy that you're back?"" he said to Vivian.  
  
Seeing her brother brought Vivian joy, yet she felt unsettled by Bryan's unannounced decision to bring her home.  
  
This time, she was back to reconcile with him. She had chosen him over her own family to make him happy.  
  
""I was the one who asked Bryan to bring you home. Mom and Dad have been eagerly awaiting your return,"" Kian explained. ""Your journey with Bryan is long. There's no need to rush.""  
  
Upon hearing Kian's words, Vivian felt a bit relieved. She smiled and glanced at Bryan. ""I had hoped to spend a bit more time with Bryan, yet now that I'm here, heading home first seems fitting.""  
  
Bryan's reaction was stoic, his face unreadable. He casually placed a hand in his pocket, leaning against the car, and offered a simple nod in acknowledgment.  
  
""I think it's time that I leave,"" he said.  
  
Eileen, upon catching this cue, promptly moved to open the door for him. Bryan turned and got into the car. However, just as Eileen was about to close the door behind him, Vivian intervened, leaning in to exchange a few more words with Bryan.  
  
""Bryan, I plan to visit Stella in Dawson Mansion first thing tomorrow morning,"" Vivian said.  
  
The light inside the car was dim, and Eileen could barely make out the defined contours of Bryan's profile through the window.  
  
Bryan parted his lips slightly to respond, ""Sure.""  
  
Content with his answer, Vivian stepped back to rejoin Kian, sending a parting wave Bryan's way.  
  
After shutting the door, Eileen addressed Kian and Vivian with a courteous farewell. ""Goodbye.""  
  
She then circled to the driver's side of the car, seated herself, and drove off with a practiced ease that belied the heaviness in her heart.  
  
The return to the company was necessitated by Bryan's schedule, which included an international online meeting demanding his attendance. As his assistant, Eileen's duties tethered her to his side almost incessantly.  
  
Consequently, at two in the morning, she found herself waiting for the end of his meeting.  
  
He called and said in a clear, pleasant voice, ""Come in.""  
  
The command was brief. There was no need for him to confirm her presence. Three years had nurtured a tacit understanding between them, perfect in both personal and professional contexts.  
  
Eileen, with the divorce papers in hand, walked into the office. Before she could turn around, a strong hand pulled her into an embrace.  
  
Bryan kissed her the next second, and his hands moved restlessly over her body.  
  
Stunned for a few seconds, Eileen leaned back to avoid his lips, surprise showing in her eyes.  
  
""What's the matter?"" Bryan asked, his voice almost hoarse with evident arousal.  
  
Biting her lip, Eileen gave the divorce agreement to him. ""Mr. Dawson, here is your divorce agreement. Do you need to revise it?""  
  
Bryan took a deep breath, placed the agreement on the desk without looking at it, and turned to gaze at her.  
  
""Eileen, you don't seem like yourself today,"" he said.  
  
Eileen couldn't tell if his comment was because she had been watching them in the car or because of the current situation. She tried to change the subject with a strained smile. ""Mr. Dawson, it's getting late. Should I take you home to rest? You have to be at the Dawson Mansion tomorrow morning, remember?""  
  
""It's too late to go home now. Let's stay here tonight,"" Bryan said, looking towards the lounge.  
  
Eileen's time in the lounge never exceeded three hours whenever he required her presence. Once he had satisfied his needs, she would put on her clothes and leave.  
  
The only occasion her stay had extended beyond this duration had been when the weakness in her legs had compelled her to rest on the bed for some time.  
  
This was the first time Bryan had invited her to spend the night.  
  
It was her first instance of refusing Bryan. ""Mr. Dawson, engaging in such actions is inappropriate, not to mention that...""  
  
Vivian had returned.  
  
But before she could complete her sentence, Bryan interjected, ""Are you rejecting my request?""  
  
Eileen furrowed her brow. Shouldn't she refuse him?  
  
As his wife, she was about to get a divorce. How could she continue to stay in the manner of a mistress?  
  
Furthermore, if he desired companionship, why hadn't he asked Vivian to stay, especially considering Vivian's apparent willingness?  
  
However, it wasn't her place to pose these questions. Regardless of her internal confusion, she was compelled to suppress it.  
  
""Mr. Dawson, I have commitments at home,"" she stated, her words a polite but clear denial.  
  
Bryan dipped his head, resting it against her shoulder, his breath warm against her collarbone, causing a tingling sensation.  
  
""Then take me to Oak Villas on your way back. Tomorrow, bring the divorce agreement and pick me up to go to Dawson Mansion,"" he murmured, his breath brushing her neck. Then, he straightened up, walked back to his desk, took his suit, and departed.  
  
Eileen remained silent as she followed him out. Claiming she had matters to attend to at home wasn't entirely an excuse.  
  
After dropping Bryan off, she reached her apartment within ten minutes.  
  
The apartment was a duplex. It was modest in size but spanning two levels, valued at around two million dollars due to its desirable location.  
  
Bryan had given it to her as a birthday present the previous year, at a night they had been intimate.  
  
Upon returning, she set down her purse and car keys, switched on the light, and ascended to the second floor. There, she retrieved her marriage certificate and the needed documents from the bedside drawer before heading back downstairs to place them in her bag.  
  
If Stella Dawson, Bryan's grandmother, consented to Vivian and Bryan reconciling tomorrow, the subsequent step would be to finalize her divorce with him.  
  
She knew she wouldn't have the opportunity to return for the documents tomorrow.  
  
Exposing her identity as his wife would invariably end her role as his assistant.  
  
She pondered over how to reveal to him tomorrow that she was the wife he had forgotten.  
  
Would Bryan ever believe her intentions had been to solely work for him?  
  
Due to Bryan's inability to recognize her and her urgent need for the job, she had kept her identity hidden.  
  
Later, discovering his disdain for deceit had complicated matters further.  
  
She had found herself too fearful to tell him that.  
  
But now, she was left with no option but to hope that she would not be in a terrible situation tomorrow.  
  
Lost in thought, she eventually dozed off on the sofa. The alarm, set for six in the morning, woke her up.  
  
Glancing at the clock, she hurried to get ready, applying makeup meticulously, even though the makeup was unable to conceal the shadows under her eyes.  
  
She boiled two eggs and warmed up a bottle of milk as her breakfast. She finished eating before setting off to Oak Villas.  
  
Despite lacking an appetite, she had forced herself to eat. Knowing the divorce papers would mark the start of her job search, she needed the energy.  
  
Looking tired, Bryan boarded the car and immediately closed his eyes, adding to Eileen's already somber mood.  
  
  
Chapter3 Apex Group's CEO Is Getting A New Wife  
The Dawson Mansion occupied a sprawling hillside, encompassing over five thousand square meters. At its iron gate, Vivian awaited in her vehicle.  
  
Bryan and Eileen arrived at the gate. ""Stop the car,"" Bryan said. Without delay, Eileen steered the car to the roadside and parked.  
  
Bryan then opened the door and exited the car. Vivian, who was vibrant like a young girl, had been in the car ahead of them. She also disembarked and hurried towards Bryan.  
  
""Bryan, I was too apprehensive to enter alone, so I waited for you here,"" Vivian admitted.  
  
For the first time, Eileen chose to remain inside the car. She observed through the window, noting Bryan's face was turned away from her, his expression one of tenderness and indulgence towards Vivian. However, Eileen knew that his softness would evaporate once he was confronted with the truth.  
  
At that moment, the iron gate began to open slowly, and the butler, Jarred, emerged.  
  
""Miss Warren, welcome back. It's been a while,"" he greeted.  
  
With a bright smile, Vivian responded, ""Yes, it has been a long time! But... We'll see each other often soon!""  
  
Jarred offered a courteous smile before turning his attention to Bryan. ""Sir, had you informed me of your arrival earlier, I could have been prepared. Your grandmother mentioned wanting to visit the church and, acting on a sudden impulse, she went there last night. Yet, here you are today.""  
  
Vivian's smile faded at his words.  
  
Bryan furrowed his brow in response.  
  
Eileen, on the other hand, was still seated in the car, struggling to suppress her laughter.  
  
Her amusement wasn't sparked by the delay in exposing her identity.  
  
Rather, it was Stella's deliberate avoidance of them and her overt revelation of this fact, designed to provoke their frustration, that Eileen found humorously ironic.  
  
""When will Stella return?"" Vivian asked, struggling to conceal her disappointment.  
  
Jarred took a moment before responding, ""She didn't mention a specific time, but she won't return soon. She usually stays there for at least half a month. This time, she mentioned wanting to enjoy a few extra days of quiet.""  
  
Stella had chosen to be absent this morning because she knew Bryan would come here with Vivian.  
  
Bryan's parents had been living abroad for more than ten years. Their work kept them so busy that they only managed to come home once or twice a year.  
  
Stella had raised Bryan and valued him more than her own life. Eileen could understand why Stella would have hard feelings toward Vivian because of what had happened six years ago.  
  
Yesterday, Eileen had been too concerned about the consequences of her identity being revealed to consider Stella's feelings.  
  
How could Stella easily forgive Vivian?  
  
Eileen got out of the car and greeted the butler, ""Good morning, Jarred.""  
  
When Jarred saw her, his smile was more sincere than it had been for Vivian. ""Miss Curtis, Mrs. Dawson mentioned you two days ago. She appreciated how hard you've been working for Mr. Dawson and reminded me to tell Mr. Dawson to treat you well.""  
  
At that moment, Eileen stiffened because she noticed Bryan and Vivian were both looking at her.  
  
Now, it was clear that Stella valued Eileen, Bryan's assistant, more than Vivian.  
  
At this point, Eileen regretted getting out of the car.  
  
She turned to Bryan, unsure of what to say next.  
  
""Since grandma is not here, let's go back first,"" Bryan suggested.  
  
He didn't hold Eileen responsible. He knew Stella had done that deliberately. He opened the door of Vivian's car and told Vivian, ""You should go back.""  
  
Vivian walked over to the black Benz and got in, refusing to go back. ""I don't want to go back. I want to go to the company with you,"" she said.  
  
Bryan remained quiet for a moment before he turned, offered Jarred a look, and entered the black Benz.  
  
""Take care, Jarred. Goodbye,"" Eileen said her farewells. Then, she entered the car and drove off.  
  
Vivian's arrival at the company stirred discussions.  
  
Everyone was aware of Bryan's marriage, understanding it was primarily to please his grandmother.  
  
In the six years that followed, his wife had never been seen by them, making it clear Bryan's marriage was in name only.  
  
Vivian's return, marked by her presence at the company, seemed to stake her claim.  
  
The implications for the future were clear.  
  
While Eileen was preparing coffee, some colleagues approached her, eager for gossip. ""Eileen, is the boss about to change his wife?""  
  
""He has never actually had a wife before,"" Eileen replied.  
  
Despite feeling upset, Eileen reminded herself to come to terms with reality.  
  
All she could do was brace for the eventual revelation of her identity and the consequences that would follow. She resolved not to disclose her identity proactively.  
  
She believed that telling Bryan the truth herself wouldn't mitigate his anger. Anticipating her inevitable dismissal, she valued each day that she could still work here.  
  
""You're right. I just saw Miss Warren. She's stunning!""  
  
""Indeed. Mr. Dawson has clearly not forgotten her even after six years. She must be charming!""  
  
As this topic unfolded, more people joined the conversation. Eileen, holding her coffee, took a sip amidst the chatter.  
  
After finishing her coffee, Eileen washed the cup and addressed her coworkers, ""Let's focus on our tasks. Remember, work is paramount.""  
  
The identity of Bryan's enigmatic wife sparked widespread curiosity within the company. Eileen often caught snippets of their conversations, their speculation about the wife's identity never ceasing.  
  
There were even whispers about a plan to loosen Bryan's tongue with alcohol at a social gathering, hoping he would reveal information about his wife.  
  
Eileen wished she could enlighten them that no amount of alcohol would help because Bryan was oblivious to his wife's identity himself.  
  
As her colleagues dispersed, Eileen anticipated their continued gossip in quieter corners.  
  
Returning to her desk, she found Vivian occupying her chair.  
  
""Eileen, you've returned,"" Vivian greeted her with a warm smile, looking like she was in a good mood. Clearly, she didn't take the butler's earlier comments to heart.  
  
""Miss Warren, shouldn't you be with Mr. Dawson in his office?"" Eileen approached, wearing a courteous smile.  
  
""He's occupied with a meeting,"" Vivian responded, gesturing to the chair beside her.  
  
That chair was usually situated in Bryan's office, but it had been relocated by Vivian, indicating her intentions to stay here for a while.  
  
""There's no need for formality between us. Just call me Vivian. We're about the same age, after all."" Vivian noticed Eileen's hesitation and gently urged her to take a seat.  
  
Eileen, on the other hand, was apprehensive because she was worried about what Vivian might do.  
  
""Bryan can be quite temperamental. You've probably been scolded a lot by him over the years, right?"" Vivian said, her tone casual.  
  
""It's alright. I've come to understand his actions,"" Eileen replied.  
  
""Bryan mentioned you're the longest-serving assistant he's had, a testament to your competence,"" Vivian remarked. ""I've seen many male assistants like my brother's assistant, Benjamin. You seem to be better than most of them.""  
  
Eileen listened with her gaze lowered. There was a sense of detachment in her eyes. Vivian's friendliness left her feeling slightly guilty.  
  
""Is Bryan always so tied up with work?"" Despite the fact that Eileen wasn't responding, Vivian kept the conversation going.  
  
""He's extremely busy, not finishing work until around ten each evening,"" Eileen replied.  
  
""Could you share his schedule with me?"" Vivian asked, gesturing with her phone. ""You can send it to me over WhatsApp.""  
  
It became clear to Eileen now that Vivian's reason for connecting on WhatsApp had been merely to access Bryan's schedule.  
  
""I'm sorry, Miss Warren, but I'm not at liberty to share Mr. Dawson's schedule,"" Eileen said, respectfully refusing Vivian.  
  
""Not even with me? Given our connection, I assure you, I wouldn't disclose his schedule to anyone,"" Vivian said.  
  
""Miss Warren, please understand my position. Don't make things difficult for me,"" Eileen replied, not wanting to seem obstructive to Vivian deliberately. Her commitment to professional ethics simply wouldn't permit such an action.  
  
Disclosing Bryan's whereabouts carelessly could lead to dire repercussions.  
  
Vivian exhaled in resignation. ""It seems neither of you is easy to sway. Yet, if I can make Bryan happy, I'm confident he'll manage the situation with his grandmother.""  
  
Eileen, however, silently considered Vivian's optimism misplaced. Had Bryan been capable of navigating his relationship with Stella, the coerced marriage six years prior would not have occurred.  
  
The marriage seemed more like an agreement between Bryan and Stella.  
  
Bryan wouldn't even be able to get a divorce without Stella's approval.  
  
""I think he holds some resentment for what transpired six years ago. My return is an attempt at restitution. If you're unwilling to disclose his schedule, might you assist me in another manner?"" Vivian said, staring at Eileen with hopeful eyes.  
  
Faced with Vivian's earnest request, Eileen found herself unable to decline.  
  
""If it's within my capacity, I'll lend my assistance,"" Eileen replied.  
  
Vivian's expression brightened at the response. ""I haven't finalized my plans yet. I'll reach out to you on WhatsApp once I do!""  
  
Eileen nodded in agreement. Before Vivian could say something more, an intercom buzz interrupted them.  
  
""Bring me a cup of coffee."" Bryan's voice was clear and pleasant to the ear.  
  
Before Eileen could rise, Vivian was already on her feet, declaring, ""Leave these small tasks to me from now on. Focus on your responsibilities!""  
  
With that, she proceeded to prepare coffee and delivered it to Bryan's office.  
  
Eileen massaged her temples, refocusing on her tasks. She removed the USB drive from her computer and headed to the copy room.  
  
There, while lost in thought beside the printer, she inadvertently produced ten copies without realizing it.  
  
A colleague entering the room noticed it and said, ""Eileen, why did you make so many copies?""  
  
Eileen's mind had been preoccupied with thoughts of what might be transpiring between Vivian and Bryan in his office. She was snapped back to reality by her colleague.  
  
""I've finished using the printer. You can use it now,"" she said.  
  
Exiting the copy room with the documents in hand, she was swiftly guided to a secluded corner.  
  
""Eileen, is it true that Mr. Dawson's first love has returned?"" Judie Curtis asked, donning a business suit and makeup too heavy for her age, not pausing for a response. ""What's gonna happen to you? Were your two years sleeping with him all for naught?""  
  
Perhaps due to how agitated she was, her voice was loud enough to garner the attention of the people leaving the copy room.  
  
Frowning, Eileen responded, ""Please, you don't need to worry about me. Moreover, such topics are not appropriate for work hours.""  
  
Judie was the only person privy to Eileen's private matters with Bryan.  
  
""How could I not worry? Roderick and I are looking for a place in the school district, remember?"" she said with urgency.  
  
Eileen met Judie's gaze, which carried a hint of self-serving intent.  
  
Roderick was Eileen's younger brother, and Judie was his spouse, a modest university alumna.  
  
Judie had benefited from Eileen's support to secure a position in the company.  
  
Now, Judie's expectations had escalated to a car and a house, and she wanted Eileen to help her achieve that.  
  
  
Chapter4 Has Vivian Spent Time With Bryan In The Lounge Before?  
""The responsibility to purchase a house lies with you two,"" Eileen responded.  
  
Judie's eyes brimmed with anger. The moment she realized Eileen was about to leave, she caught Eileen by the arm, her voice tinged with disbelief. ""How can you even say that? Aren't you aware of your real family ties? You lavish care on a stepmother with your money, yet refuse to purchase a home for your own brother? Think about it. That woman's time is short, and soon, you'll find yourself leaning on Roderick, your brother!""  
  
Eileen's lips curled into a mocking smile as she replied, ""I'll lean on him? Isn't it supposed to be the other way around? I think you're mistaken. The money I earn is mine to spend as I please. If you want to keep your job here, mind your manners.""  
  
With a flick of her wrist, she freed herself from Judie's grasp and left, her expression icy.  
  
A shiver of fear crept through Judie. After all, Eileen's influence was second only to Bryan's in the company.  
  
But there was Eileen, with a cushy job under Bryan, driving a good car, dwelling in a spacious home, and even tending to her sick stepmother. Yet, she turned a blind eye to her brother's situation.  
  
It just wasn't right!  
  
With that notion in mind, Judie bolted to the restroom to call Roderick. They had to convince Eileen to buy them a house.  
  
Meanwhile, Eileen returned to her desk, banishing all distractions, and her productivity soared.  
  
Earlier, Vivian's interruption meant Eileen hadn't completed her tasks on time. Now, as the office emptied for lunch, Eileen remained in her seat to work.  
  
Roderick's calls came twice. She ignored them both, so engrossed in her work that lunchtime passed unnoticed. Soon, it was evening.  
  
Her dedication had not gone unseen. Bryan had every reason to hold her in high regard, just as Vivian had remarked, for her diligence indeed outshone many.

That’s the average number of weeks a person gets if they live to 76.

My mom is that age now. She’s healthy, happy, and living by the beach in Mexico with my dad. Walks, church, wine, and a tight circle of friends to laugh and gossip with. Every time they visit, I help them pack the car. Then I FaceTime them as they drive off, just to make sure they’re safe. And when I hang up… I cry. Every time.

Because I know one day, that drive won’t happen again.

I feel overwhelming gratitude that I can still talk to them. That they’re still here. And the same goes for my wife and son. Every time I leave the house, I quietly acknowledge that it could be the last time I see them. It probably won’t be—but I never let myself forget how lucky I am for this moment.

We get caught up in the chaos of daily life—coffee, traffic, folding laundry—and it’s easy to miss how precious those little moments are. But they’re the whole thing. And lately, I’ve just been so grateful to notice.

If this resonates, I started a space called GratefulAF—where we talk about anchoring our gratitude in mortality, presence, and legacy.

• Alice In Wonderland themed cafe (Mad Hatter’s tea party vibes)

• 60’s themed coffee bar (think Carnaby Street mod vibes)

• Retro futurism themed restaurant (50’s and 60’s vision of the future).

• Victorian style tea house.

I Don’t Think We Were in the Real Hospital Anymore,"It was past midnight when Chris and I left the old 24-hour diner at the edge of town. We had spent the evening catching up over burgers and coffee, talking about high school memories and future plans that would likely never materialize.

As we strolled toward my car parked a little further down the block, Chris slowed his pace. I glanced over and noticed him rubbing his temples. He was pale.

""Everything okay, man?"" I asked, half-jokingly. ""Too much greasy diner food?""

Chris shook his head, wincing as he leaned against a nearby lamppost. ""No, it’s… different,"" he mumbled. ""Everything's spinning."" He grimaced, clutching his stomach as he swayed on his feet.

I rushed over and grabbed him by the arm just as his legs gave out.  His breathing was ragged, each breath shallow and strained. A jolt of panic shot through me. I wasn’t sure what was happening, but it was more than just a bad burger.

""Come on,"" I said, guiding him toward the car. ""We need to get you to the hospital.""

We barely made it to the passenger seat before he collapsed completely. I managed to push him inside, buckling his seatbelt as his head lolled against the window. His breathing had grown faint, his skin cold. I didn’t waste any more time. I jumped into the driver’s seat and sped toward the hospital. The roads were empty, the entire town blanketed in a pale bluish light that made everything look strangely surreal.

When the hospital finally came into view, I pulled up to the emergency entrance and skidded to a stop. The automatic doors slid open with a soft hiss, and I half-dragged, half-carried Chris inside. The bright fluorescent lights inside the emergency room burned my eyes as I shouted for help.

A nurse and a security guard rushed over immediately. Chris was placed on a gurney and whisked away into a triage room. I tried to follow, but the nurse held up a hand. ""You need to stay in the waiting room, sir. Someone will come speak to you soon.""

Reluctantly, I turned back and made my way into the waiting room. It was a small, uninviting space lined with rows of faded plastic chairs. The harsh lighting overhead buzzed like a hive of angry bees, casting a cold, sterile glow over everything. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic, with a hint of something stale, like old coffee or cheap hospital food.

The reception desk sat at the far end of the room, cluttered with stacks of paperwork and a dusty computer monitor. Behind the desk, a tired-looking receptionist typed away with little enthusiasm, barely glancing up as I entered. She looked like she had been working the night shift for years, with deep shadows under her eyes and a weary slump in her posture. A glass partition separated her from the waiting area, with a small sliding window used to speak to patients.

Aside from the receptionist, there were only a few other people scattered around the room. A middle-aged man in a wrinkled jacket sat slumped in a chair, staring blankly at the floor tiles, his face pale and drawn. Across from him, a young woman scrolled through her phone, her foot tapping rhythmically against the leg of the chair. In the far corner, an elderly woman with a hunched back knitted quietly, her lips moving as she murmured to herself, though I couldn’t make out the words.

The wall-mounted TV flickered above, showing a muted news broadcast with closed captions scrolling across the screen. Next to it, a clock ticked irregularly, the second hand jerking with each movement as though struggling to keep time. The room itself seemed caught in some liminal state.

I chose a seat near the corner, trying to calm my breathing. My heart was still racing from the rush to the hospital.

The seat beneath me was stiff and uncomfortable, offering little relief from the tension gripping my body. I shifted, trying to find a better position, when I felt something crinkle under my leg. Frowning, I reached down and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper that had been wedged into the chair. It was old and yellowed at the edges, like it had been left there for a while.

Curious, I unfolded the paper and smoothed it out on my lap. The handwriting was rushed, uneven, as if whoever wrote it had been in a hurry, or panicked. The list was numbered, and as I began to read, I couldn't help but feel a mix of surprise and amusement at what was written there.

Rule 1. ""Avoid making eye contact with the receptionist between 2:00 AM and 2:30 AM.""

I raised an eyebrow. That seemed oddly specific. Why would anyone write something like that? I glanced over at the receptionist, who was still tapping away at her keyboard, oblivious to the rest of the room. Was this some kind of prank? The idea made me smirk a little, despite the heaviness in the air.

Rule 2. ""Never walk past the reception desk without greeting the receptionist after 2:30 AM.""

I let out a short, dry laugh. ""So I’m supposed to be polite now?"" I muttered under my breath, shaking my head. It was all so ridiculous. Maybe someone had written this as a joke to mess with the people stuck here at odd hours, bored out of their minds. I could imagine some bored night-shifter scribbling out these 'rules' as a way to pass the time.

Rule 3. ""If a visitor arrives asking for directions, do not help them.""

I paused. That one was… strange. It carried a different weight compared to the others. Who wouldn’t help someone lost in a hospital, of all places?

Rule 4. ""If you hear your friend’s voice calling from down the hallway, do not leave the waiting room to look for them.""

The amusement drained from my expression. I felt a chill run up my spine, as if the temperature in the room had just dropped a few degrees. I glanced toward the dimly lit hallway that led to the ER rooms. It seemed to stretch into darkness. I shook my head, pushing the thought away. This list was just some random nonsense… wasn't it?

I continued reading, my curiosity now tinged with unease.

Rule 5. ""If a power outage occurs, stay seated and do not move.""

Rule 6. ""If a door that should be locked is found open, close it immediately and do not look inside.""

The hairs on the back of my neck prickled. I couldn’t explain why, but each rule seemed to grow darker, more foreboding as I read on. It wasn’t just the content of the rules, it was the way they were written, as if someone were trying to warn me.

Rule 7. ""Do not look through the glass doors leading to the courtyard after 4:00 AM.""

Rule 8. ""If you feel a sudden chill, do not look over your shoulder.""

That one made me swallow hard. There was something inherently unsettling about the thought of a chill creeping up on you from behind, and not being able to turn around to see what, or who might be there. I couldn't help but glance behind me, but there was nothing there. Just the same sterile room, with its faded chairs and buzzing lights.

I reached the last rule, and for some reason, my heart beat a little faster.

Rule 9. ""If a security guard tells you it’s time to leave, check the clock before listening. It's safe to leave after 6:00 AM.""

My gaze flicked up to the wall-mounted clock, its second hand twitching with every tick. It read 1:30 AM.

At the bottom of the paper, written in shaky red ink, were the words: ""Trust me. I learned the hard way.""

There was a dark, crusted stain on the corner, one that looked disturbingly like dried blood. The sight of it made my stomach twist. I rubbed my fingers over the words, feeling the rough texture of the ink beneath my skin.

I couldn’t help but let out a short, nervous laugh. ""What kind of place is this?"" I whispered to myself.

I slumped back in the chair. It was hard to shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, but I forced myself to dismiss it as a weird prank. The list couldn’t actually mean anything, just someone’s twisted idea of a joke. I leaned my head back against the wall and closed my eyes, trying to calm my thoughts. A part of me couldn’t stop thinking about Chris and the way he had collapsed in the parking lot.

The quiet hum of the waiting room wrapped itself around me, making the place feel even more isolating. That’s when I heard it. My name, spoken in a low, barely audible voice that seemed to drift down the hallway. ""Adam… Adam...""

My eyes shot open, and my body tensed. The voice was unmistakable, it was Chris. I jerked my head towards the corridor leading to the ER rooms, but there was no one in sight, just the pale overhead lights flickering. The voice came again, a little louder this time. ""Adam, help me…""

I jumped up from the chair, the sound of my name sending shivers down my spine. My feet were already moving before I realized it. I took a few steps into the hallway.

I glanced back at the waiting area, now a few steps behind me. The other visitors, still scattered about, seemed completely unaware, oblivious to the voice echoing down the hall.

""Adam…"" Chris’s voice was more desperate now, laced with pain.

I took another step down the hallway, my footsteps echoing against the floor. As I walked deeper into the corridor, the fluorescent lights overhead buzzed louder, some of them flickering out completely, leaving long stretches of darkness. The ER rooms lined the sides of the hallway, their doors slightly ajar.

I hesitated as I reached one of the open doorways. I peered inside and immediately wished I hadn’t. There, standing in the center of the dimly lit room, was a man in a patient’s gown, facing me. The man's head moved in quick, jerking motions, shaking from side to side so rapidly that I couldn’t make out any details. It was just a blur, a sickening blur. Then, without warning, the door slammed shut with a deafening bang, and I stumbled back in shock.

My breathing grew shallow as I tried to make sense of what I’d just seen. But there was no time to process it. Chris’s voice came again, further down the hallway, ""Adam, please…""

I pushed forward, forcing myself to continue. The unsettling darkness around me seemed to press in from all sides. I came across another room, the door half-open. Inside, I could see a doctor standing over a patient, his back hunched as he examined something on the table. The doctor wore a white lab coat and surgical mask, his features obscured. But there was something off about the way he moved, his motions were robotic. Then I noticed the tool in his hand, a bone saw. He raised it slowly, the harsh metal glinting under the dim light, and then I heard a gut-wrenching scream from the patient on the table.

I stumbled backward, slamming into the wall behind me, my eyes wide with terror. When I looked back into the room, it was empty. There was no doctor, no patient. Just a dark, vacant space.

My hands trembled as I rubbed my face, trying to snap out of whatever hallucination I was trapped in. ""This can’t be real,"" I whispered to myself, but the corridor seemed to stretch endlessly ahead of me, and Chris’s voice continued to call out, drawing me further in.

As I turned the next corner, I froze. There, hanging in the doorway of a nearby room, was a mass of dark hair, long and tangled, spilling down from just beyond the doorframe. It looked like someone was standing behind the door, peeking around the corner. A single eye, black as pitch, stared directly at me from the darkness.

I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. The figure remained there, still and silent, just watching me. I took a slow step forward, and then the eye pulled back into the shadows, disappearing from view. The hallway was deathly quiet, save for the low hum of the lights. I forced myself to move past the doorway, my pulse hammering in my ears.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the figure again, just around the corner of the room, her head unnaturally high, as if she were crouched against the ceiling. I could see more of her this time; her elongated arm stretched out, the bony hand reaching towards me. Before I could react, the hand brushed my shoulder, cold and corpse-stiff... its fingers scratched into my skin like claws.

I bolted, my shoes squeaking on the linoleum as I raced down the hallway. I had no idea where I was going; I just wanted to get away from whatever that thing was. I threw open the first door I saw and stumbled back into the waiting room.

My heart pounded in my chest as I staggered to a stop. Everything appeared normal again, the reception desk, the plastic chairs, the other visitors who hadn’t moved an inch. It was as if none of it had happened. But my skin prickled with the lingering touch of that hand. Glancing at my shoulder, I noticed 3 faded scratch marks, a reminder that something was very, very wrong.

I slumped back into a chair, catching my breath, trying to make sense of the nightmare I had just experienced. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the crumpled list of rules, my hands trembling as I unfolded it. I glanced at Rule 4 again, the words seeming to taunt me: If you hear your friend’s voice calling from down the hallway, do not leave the waiting room to look for them.

I had ignored it, and now I was starting to believe that those rules weren’t a joke after all.

I tried to calm myself, my breathing coming in short, ragged gasps as I leaned back in the chair. I ran my hands through my hair, trying to force myself to think rationally. Maybe I was just sleep-deprived, or maybe the stress of seeing Chris collapse was catching up to me. I told myself that I had only imagined the things I saw in the hallway. But no matter how hard I tried to convince myself, the feeling of that cold hand brushing against my skin lingered.

I glanced at the clock, 1:45 AM. The minutes seemed to crawl by. I couldn't shake the dread that had settled in my chest. My thoughts drifted back to the list of rules. Each one seemed ridiculous on its own, but after my experience in the hallway, I found myself paying closer attention to each word.

That was when I noticed him, a man who hadn’t been in the room before. He stood near the entrance, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his long coat, his eyes scanning the waiting room like he was searching for someone. His presence sent a jolt of unease through me. I was sure he hadn’t been there earlier; I would have remembered his tall, lanky figure and the unsettling way his gaze seemed to linger on the other visitors, one by one.

The list. I pulled it from my pocket and read the third rule again: If a visitor arrives asking for directions, do not help them.

The man’s gaze found me, and he started walking toward where I sat. My body stiffened, every muscle tensing involuntarily. There was no mistaking his intention. He stopped a few feet away, leaning slightly forward, as though inspecting me.

""Excuse me,"" he said in a voice that was calm, but too deliberate. ""Could you help me find the ICU? I seem to be… a little lost.""

The tone of his voice was polite enough, but there was something off about it, something that put me on edge. It was as though he was trying to mimic normal speech but wasn’t quite getting it right. I glanced around the waiting room, but no one else seemed to notice the man’s presence. The receptionist didn’t even look up.

I shook my head, gripping the list tighter in my hand. ""I’m sorry. I can’t help you,"" I stammered.

The man didn’t move. He just kept staring at me, his eyes narrowing slightly. ""Are you sure?"" he asked, his voice growing softer, almost coaxing. ""It won’t take but a moment. It’s just down the hall… right?""

I didn’t know what to say. A part of me felt guilty for not helping him. But the words on the list kept flashing in my mind: Do not help them.

I forced myself to look away, hoping he would take the hint and leave. But instead, he took a step closer.

""It’s not very kind to ignore someone who needs help,"" he said, his tone now edged with something darker. I glanced at his face, and for a split second, his features seemed to shift. His mouth stretched into a wide, unnatural grin, the kind that didn’t belong on a human face. The corners of his lips seemed to extend too far, the teeth behind them slightly jagged.

I shot up from my chair, stumbling backward. The man’s smile didn’t waver as he turned his head slightly, like he was examining me from a different angle. Then, he turned towards the reception desk and started walking, slowly and unnatural. At one point, his head snapped towards me, unnaturally, the same grin on his face, as he continued walking. I froze, I couldn't look away. Then, as he reached the reception desk, he just passed thru it and then he suddenly disappeared.

My gaze darted around the waiting room. The other visitors were still exactly where they had been moments ago, their expressions unchanged, their movements as mechanical as before.

I glanced back at the receptionist. She was still at her desk, her face illuminated by the pale glow of the computer screen.

My gaze flickered up to the clock on the wall, it was 1:58 AM, and Rule 1 flashed in my mind: Avoid making eye contact with the receptionist between 2:00 AM and 2:30 AM.

After a few minutes, I glanced toward her, my eyes drifting out of habit. It was just for a second. The receptionist was staring straight at me, her eyes locked onto mine with an intensity that made my heart skip a beat. She wasn’t moving. It was as if she’d been waiting for this moment.

I tore my gaze away, my pulse quickening. As I turned my head, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed her get up from her chair, her movements oddly stiff, as though her joints didn’t bend the right way. She walked forward, but not around the reception desk, she passed through it, like it wasn’t even there. I froze, not daring to look directly at her again.

I squeezed my eyes shut. I felt the air grow colder, the chill pressing against my skin. It felt as if she were getting closer. I could hear the faintest rustle of fabric, the light creak of footsteps on the floor, growing louder with each passing second.

Don’t look… just don’t look, I told myself, my hands gripping the edges of the chair. I sat there, tense and unmoving, my eyes squeezed shut as if I could will her away by sheer force of will.

Then, everything went still. The room fell into an unnatural quiet, the buzz of the fluorescent lights the only sound left to ground me in reality. I opened my eyes slowly, half-expecting to see her standing inches away from me, her face contorted into something inhuman. But the receptionist was back at her desk, looking down at the monitor, her posture as unbothered as if she hadn’t moved at all. The other people in the waiting room seemed unchanged, as though nothing unusual had happened.

I glanced at the clock. 2:40 AM.

A wave of relief washed over me, my shoulders sagging as the tension finally started to leave my body. I forced myself to my feet, my legs still shaky beneath me. I couldn’t just sit there, feeling like a trapped animal. I needed to move, to clear my head.

As I got up to walk around the room, I remembered Rule 2: Never walk past the reception desk without greeting the receptionist after 2:30 AM. I wasn’t about to take any more chances. I turned toward the receptionist and gave her a nod, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Uh… hi,"" I mumbled awkwardly.

She didn’t look up, didn’t react at all, just continued to type away on the keyboard. I took that as a good sign and began walking a slow circle around the waiting room, forcing myself to stay calm, to pretend that everything was normal.

The chill in the air hadn’t entirely left. As I walked, I could feel a subtle shift in the temperature, a lingering cold that seemed to follow me. The overhead lights flickered faintly, casting brief shadows along the walls, giving the impression that the room was expanding and contracting with each pulse.

As I rounded the corner, I felt the presence behind me, something that wasn’t there before. I didn’t hear footsteps, but I sensed it nonetheless, like the weight of unseen eyes pressing against my back. It was close, just out of reach. My instinct was to turn and look, to confront whatever was creeping up behind me, but I clenched my jaw and kept my gaze forward, remembering Rule 8: If you feel a sudden chill, do not look over your shoulder.

I walked faster, my pulse quickening as the chill seemed to grow stronger with every step. The lights buzzed louder, the flickering more erratic. I felt something brush against the back of my neck, cold and light, like a breath.

I didn’t stop until I reached the chairs again, sinking into one with a shuddering breath. The presence faded, though the air remained icy, and I rubbed my hands together to warm them. I glanced back toward the reception desk, half-expecting to see the receptionist watching me again, but she remained focused on her monitor, her face lit by the soft glow of the screen.

I leaned back in the chair, my heart still racing. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong, that the rules on that crumpled piece of paper weren’t just random scribbles left behind to scare people. Whatever game I’d found myself in, it wasn’t a joke. And now, the only way out seemed to be playing along.

I sat there for a long moment, my body trembling, trying to calm my nerves and slow my breathing.

That’s when I heard the automatic doors slide open with a soft hiss. I looked up, expecting to see another late-night visitor or a nurse making rounds, but my heart almost stopped when I saw who stepped inside.

It was Chris.

He looked perfectly fine, normal. His face had color, his clothes were clean. There wasn’t a single sign that anything had been wrong with him. Relief rushed through me, and I felt the tension in my muscles finally ease.

Chris’s eyes found mine, and he broke into a small smile as he walked over.

""Hey, Adam,"" he said casually, his voice the same as always. ""They let me out early.""

The relief was so overwhelming that I laughed out loud. ""Chris, man, you scared the hell out of me,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Are you sure you’re okay? You looked pretty bad earlier.""

He shrugged, giving a dismissive wave of his hand as he settled into the chair next to me. ""Yeah, I’m fine now. Whatever it was, I guess it passed. They ran a few tests and said there was nothing serious."" He flashed that familiar grin, the one I’d seen a thousand times. ""Guess I’m just too stubborn to stay sick.""

As we talked, something in the back of my mind itched. There was an unsettling quality to the conversation, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Chris was acting normal, too normal. He was speaking in a calm, deliberate tone, his words perfectly measured. I brushed it off, figuring it was just my nerves playing tricks on me after everything that had happened tonight.

Still, as Chris continued to talk, a strange sense of déjà vu settled over me. It was as if the conversation was looping back on itself, repeating the same phrases. His voice had the same rhythm, the same inflection, almost like a recording on a loop.

Suddenly. I turned to see a nurse walking briskly down the hallway, pushing a gurney. My stomach dropped when I saw who was lying on it, Chris. He was unconscious, hooked up to a heart monitor, an oxygen mask over his face.

My gaze darted back to the seat next to me, but the chair was empty. The Chris who had been sitting beside me was gone, vanished as though he’d never been there at all. My skin prickled as a wave of cold panic spread through me.

I stared at the empty chair for a long moment, my heart pounding in my ears. Then, I saw the nurse walking by the waiting room. She glanced over at me briefly, her expression neutral.

I jumped up from my chair. ""Wait,"" I called after her. ""Is Chris okay? My friend, he was just sitting here. What’s going on?""

The nurse slowed, turning to look at me with a small, tight-lipped smile. ""Your friend is stable,"" she said. ""But he hasn’t woken up yet.""

Her words hung in the air, leaving me cold and confused. I glanced back at the empty seat, then at the nurse as she continued down the ER hallway.

My head was spinning. Had Chris really been here, or had I just imagined him?

I sank back into my chair, my body heavy with fatigue and fear. I glanced at the clock again, 3 AM. Time was moving, but not in the way it should have. I felt trapped, as though the minutes were pulling me further into the unknown.

I pulled the crumpled list of rules from my pocket and unfolded it with trembling hands, my eyes scanning the lines again, looking for answers that weren’t there. I needed to understand what was happening to me, what was happening in this place. But the rules only deepened the mystery, the words twisting in my mind like a riddle I couldn’t solve.

Time seemed to move strangely now. I couldn’t tell how long I had been sitting in that chair, how long I had been wandering the room. The clock above seemed to skip minutes or stall entirely, and my sense of reality continued to blur. I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the fatigue that clung to me like a shroud. I glanced at the clock again, it showed 5:55 AM. Almost there, I thought. Almost free.

That was when a security guard appeared in the doorway, his silhouette casting a long shadow across the waiting room floor. He was a broad-shouldered man with a neatly trimmed mustache and a calm, almost reassuring presence. He walked toward me with an easy stride and stopped just a few feet away.

""Sir, it's time to leave,"" he said in a deep, measured voice. ""The ER is closing for non-patient visitors.""

I blinked, my thoughts catching up slowly. ""But… my friend, Chris… is still…""

Just then, I saw Chris walking out of the ER hallway. He waved to me, a tired but genuine smile on his face. Relief flooded through me, and I started to get up, then hesitated, the words from Rule 9 echoing in my head: If a security guard tells you it’s time to leave, check the clock before listening.

I turned my gaze toward the clock above the reception desk, 6:01 AM. My shoulders sagged in relief. I was finally free of this place. I nodded and followed the security guard toward the exit, Chris walking beside me. As we stepped out into the cool morning air, I felt like I could finally breathe again.

We got into my car, and I started the engine. I felt a small smile tug at my lips. I pulled out of the hospital parking lot, the tension in my chest slowly beginning to fade.

But as I drove, a strange unease crept over me. The world outside the car windows seemed darker than it should have been. I glanced at the sky, it was still a deep, inky black, with no trace of the early morning light. It was too dark, too quiet.

I squinted, peering between the trees lining the road, and my heart skipped a beat. In the shadows, I saw faint figures standing there, their forms barely visible, distorted as if they were made of mist.

Panic surged through me. I glanced at the dashboard clock, and my stomach dropped, 4:30 AM. How was that possible? It had been well past 6:00 AM when we left the hospital. I turned to look at Chris in the passenger seat, my heart pounding in my ears.

But it wasn’t Chris.

There was a shadow there, sitting beside me. Its form was a vague silhouette, its face obscured, but I could feel it watching me, feel its eyes boring into my skin. I gasped, my grip on the steering wheel tightening as my vision blurred with fear. I slammed on the brakes, skidding to a halt in the middle of the road.

Suddenly, I was back in the waiting room, seated in the same stiff plastic chair. The security guard stood in front of me, a grin spreading slowly across his face, his eyes unnaturally wide and gleaming in the harsh fluorescent light.

""Time to leave,"" he said again, his voice echoing in my head like a taunt.

I felt my mind start to unravel. Had I ever left the hospital at all? Was I trapped here, destined to relive these twisted events over and over again? I buried my face in my hands, my breathing ragged as a sense of hopelessness washed over me.

It felt like hours passed, but it could have been minutes, or even seconds. I didn’t know anymore. I was dimly aware of a nurse standing in front of me, her voice calm and soothing, pulling me back from the edge.

""Sir, your friend is stable,"" she said gently. ""He’s going to be okay, but he needs rest. He’ll be transferred to a hospital room soon, and you can visit him during regular visiting hours.""

I looked up at her, my vision clearing slowly. The waiting room was just as it had been, no sign of the security guard or anything out of the ordinary. I glanced at the clock, it read 6:30 AM, and a soft glow of morning sunlight filtered through the glass doors, filling the room with a warm light. The nightmare was over.

I nodded to the nurse, murmuring my thanks, and stumbled out of the ER, the cool morning air a welcome relief. As I reached my car, I glanced back at the hospital, half-expecting to see something out of place. But it looked like any other hospital in the early light, mundane and unthreatening. I got in the car and drove home, the sun finally rising to chase away the last remnants of darkness.

Later that day, I returned to the hospital to visit Chris. He was awake, sitting up in bed and looking surprisingly well for someone who had collapsed so suddenly the night before.

""Hey,"" I said, my voice trembling slightly as I pulled a chair up to his bedside. ""How are you feeling?""

Chris chuckled weakly. ""Better than I should, I guess,"" he replied. ""But I had the weirdest dreams last night. It was like I was half-conscious the whole time.""

My heart skipped a beat. ""What kind of dreams?""

Chris frowned, his brow furrowing as he tried to recall. ""One of them was… I came in the ER and saw you sitting in the waiting room. You looked pretty freaked out. And then there was another one… we were leaving the hospital together, just driving away into the night.""

A cold shiver ran down my spine, but I forced a smile and nodded. ""Yeah… weird,"" I said quietly, my mind racing with the memory of the night’s events.

As we sat there talking, I glanced at my shoulder, where a constant pain kept tugging at me, and saw the three scratch marks from last night.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that somewhere, out there in the darkness of the night I had just escaped, something was still waiting… and the rules of this place would not be so easily [forgotten.](https://www.reddit.com/user/CreepyStoriesJR/comments/1ilh8mp/creepystoriesjr_story_list/)",12,1748192157.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False
1kv79ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1kv79ep/how_i_get_dishes_done_faster_without_trying_to/,How i get dishes done faster without trying to will myself into it,"Started this recently. Note that we dont have a dishwasher so I am the dishwasher. I have to wash them by hand. This causes things to pile up very quickly.  My boyfriend does a lot of cooking. Large pots and pans take up so much space in the sink and all the little things like silverware and coffee cups get lost at the very bottom. So its like going fishing when all u need is one fork. Tackling them all at once takes up so much time and i prefer having all the dishes done before I can start cleaning. By the time im done with dishes im too lazy to clean by then.

I'm sure you're like me, most of u, where ur constantly moving from one room to the next at home. Just mindlessly pacing around doing this thing and getting that thing. I made up a 'three dish rule' some days its six, or four, it depends on what im feeling. I stick to that number of dishes. Today it's three.

Every time I walk into the kitchen I clean three dishes. If I forget or dont feel like it i just do six the next time. Once the dish racks are full im done for the day. Usually by three pm the dishes are done. 

This not only helps get them done, it gets u into a habit of staying on top of them. After a couple days ur already in more of the habit. You find yourself doing dishes as u go without even thinking about it and 'planning'. It makes a huge difference. My starting point is usually early in the afternoon after I've had coffee and getting set up for the day. So around noon to three, I'm doing short rounds of dishes while getting other housework done in between. I do it on my days off work, that way theyre more caught up on days i can't get to them, it jjst makes it so much easier and it's a good way to practice self discipline and holding myself accountable.

Suggestion: get a second dish rack so u have more room to get more done. The first rack fills up pretty quickly and I am not drying them by hand. Water spots are the least of my concerns lol. 

If u have any ideas of other boring tasks u can apply this to let me know! Any feedback is welcome. ",1,1748192150.0,adhdwomen,0,1.0,False

My ideal person to deliver to is an Escort, Stripper or Dominatrix. 

Last night I reached out to a girl who had used me about a year ago before I developed a serious love for the kink. I had previously just brought her a bottle of tequila . She had just come back from Calgary and was doing incalls at a hotel in my area. I reached out and my goodness did she bully me right 

Firstly she was aware I was taking the bus but still had me make multiple stops, she added to the list which got me hard lol, and I still got denied to see her 😂😂😂 literally I’m expected to deliver the items , then take a photo of it infront of her door and leave. It’s insanely hot the denial of seeing her and literally buying the items for nothing in return 😂

It took me like 5-6 hours of bussing and subway just to make it to her hotel including the shopping , plus I had to go back after delivering didn’t get home Til 3am. 

Plessse look at how pathetic I am in the texts like I’m honestly so easy once I get started. It didn’t matter what she asked for I was saying yes. Bringing her condoms was the highlight of the delivery cause she ls an escort and clearly using me to replenish what she uses for work. 
I used to cuck for my ex so hyping condoms was a normal thing for me to do for her bulls. Felt like a cuck again supporting this escort. 

I also haven’t had sex in years so supporting this respect is just really getting me horny.

I also got her a gift as she crossed a milestone, and I am a gift giver, now- over the conversation we have I realise there are many things about career, life, mental health and more where we don't align this gave me the ick. She even offered I come over to her place for a party which I refused because I already had plans and it might lead to false expectations. Over the next few days I very quickly stop texting her, here I made an error- I didn't explain and should've been more mindful. I am the kind of person who would rather have others just stop instead of creating expectations but I understand how that's not mindful

  
Fast-forward to the present day. I haven't spoken to or met her since. One of our mutual friends has become closer friends with her. I learn she has ""soft-blocked,"" the meaning of which I had only just learnt. I feel really bad that how hurt she might be and text her, I have my own challenges around guilt and people pleasing. This led me to what I now think was a mistake is reaching out to have a conversation about what happened hoping it can give both of us closure

  
The conversation started out fine and then we initially decided we will meet where I can give her an explanation. But then she wanted one on text, which is completely fine and I stated my piece as to what my mindspace was what didn't work so on, I also apologised for everything and stated my intention was not to hurt her. Well, what spiralled was her constantly blaming me despite my best efforts like she would acknowledge she understood some parts and then again go onto blame I don't respond to that very well but understand it but it started being too much. Like she would bring up that I didn't know what I wanted in life because I have been on dating apps (which she knew cause I was sharing an anecdote earlier about smoking). Anyways I thought its best to stop talking when she started blaming me for not being able to trust men anymore and causing so much trauma that she hasn't been able to go on dates. Again we never dated or did anything at all except text. This triggered me because one of the reasons my previous relationship had ended because my partner had used some words which were very strong and they didn't mean, but it just stuck with me and affected my sense of self this brought back those memories

Anyways, a few weeks later in a conversation our common friend had with other friends it turns out they admit she is a bit clingy even in friendships and has told her that since us talking she has been in multiple situations with multiple men- which is of course fine I just felt very gaslit. Moreover, she had told her we DATED which I don't think we did but sometimes very confused. I ended up feeling very gaslit by the whole conversation we had, while I am not shedding responsibility I just don't think it was the best way for her to handle this

My mom’s that age now. Still here. Still healthy. Living by the beach in Mexico with my dad—wine, church, boat rides, and a small crew of friends to gossip with. Every time they visit, I help them pack the car. FaceTime them as they drive off so they don’t get lost in traffic. And every time, after I hang up… I cry.

Because it could be the last time.

Same with my wife and son. Every time I walk out the door, I know the chances are low—but not zero—that it might be the last time I see them. That thought doesn’t haunt me like it used to. Now, it makes me grateful. Urgent. Alive.

I've been wracking my brain trying to remember the name of a creepypasta I read years ago, and I'm hoping someone here might recognize it based on the details I can recall.

It's a rulespasta—the kind where the main character has to follow a strict set of rules. In this story, the protagonist gets a job taking care of a house that's haunted by the body of a dead boy who always sits at the kitchen table.

Some of the rules include things like having to place food in front of the boy by a specific time and not being allowed to leave the kitchen until a certain time. Eventually, the protagonist breaks a couple of the rules, and the person who hired him shows up just in time to save him.
I also remember the employer bringing the protagonist a coffee, and when asked why they don’t just remove the boy, they explain that he’s tied to the house and always reappears no matter what they try.

That’s about all I can remember. I know it’s not much, but I’m really hoping someone here might recognize it. Thanks in advance—and happy hunting!",2,1748191685.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

1kv70ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1kv70ph/creatista_descaling_frequency_whats_normal_in/,Creatista descaling frequency: what's normal in your experience?,"**TL;DR version:** 

How often does your Creatista ask to be descaled? I've had a Pro for 2,5 months and it's locked itself for descaling for the second time now. Both times it happened after 130-140 uses, and the second time after using just 77 capsules. Is this normal, or a bug with my machine?

I'm aware that water hardness settings and water volume could be contributing factors, but the hardness is set to medium, and as explained below the machine doesn't actually measure the volume used, just the number of button pushes. So the fact that I make larger milk drinks rather than espressos is also not a factor. 

The descaling frequency seems excessively high, no? 

  
**Full story:**

As someone who's been a Nespresso customer for 15 years,  I'm now 2,5 months in with a new Creatista Pro and pretty shocked by the descaling frequency. Averaging 5 milk drinks per day and some water shots the machine locked itself on day 24, so approximately after 130 uses. 

After descaling it (and using it less afterwards) I kept track of my use. Now, after 75 milk drinks, 38 milk steams, 1 lungo, 1 espresso, and 22 water shots (= 137 uses) the machine is locked again. This has never happened with any other machines I've used, including the VP. 

I'm aware the descaling frequency is linked to the water hardness programmed into the machine but this is set to the default middle of the road value. 

Hence my question to you, other Creatista users: is this normal behaviour for a Creatista?

  
The first time the machine counter went from 9 uses left to 0 after making a single drink. This time around it more or less did the ""proper"" countdown from 10 to 0. I did consider that the volume run through the machine could be a factor, so during the final 10 uses I did some reverse engineering this time. Here's what I came up with:

* pushing button and stopping immediately without getting a drop of water (I forgot to insert the capsule): 1 use
* water shot from the dedicated spout: 1 use regardless of the volume
* steaming milk: 1 use regardless of the settings or milk volume
* milk drinks including a lungo capsule, steamed milk, and an additional coffee shot, followed by the automatic rinse of the steam wand: 1 use 
* steam wand rinse: 0 uses.

So as it turns out, any drink button push is counted as one use, regardless of the actual water volume running through the machine, or whether it includes milk or not. Taking this into account the machine locked itself after just 137 uses and a measly 77 used capsules.

I can control them but differently and only in certain situations e.g. no smoking or thc at work. But the minute I'm free or bored, I vaping and smoking like a chimney. Same if I'm outside or have none left - I can go a few hours without needing more. Its absolutely bizarre but its my reality. Availability seems to be my biggest problem but I can't get a spoon of coffee or one cigarette at a time.

I recently came across timed lock boxes specifically made to break habits and addictions on Amazon. One I'm looking at, quite big and about fifty quid. 

Thing is - I think this is ingenuis!

My biggest problem is having it around. I know people talk about learning self control but I really struggle especially with Bipolar. A box that I can lock and not open until a certain time would be invaluable and really help me get things under control, especially during periods of mania and depression. I eventually want to quit everything but my plan is to get 3 boxes, space my cigarettes as much as I can, have thc only available until much later in the day, have coffee available twice a day. The box cannot be opened until timer runs out.

Am I being ridiculous? Has anyone ever tried one of these and do they help?

About me: 27F, I travelled solo between May 8th and May 23rd. I hit Hiroshima (3 nights), Onomichi (3 nights), Kobe (3 nights), and Tokyo (5 nights). I don't drink, so this report will have no mention of clubs, bars, dancing, etc. I tended to wake up early, walk over 20k steps, and wrap it up at 10PM. I'm from Toronto, and a visible minority. I like beautiful nature, but prefer places with the hustle and bustle of people, so you will not find an overly quite itinerary. It's balanced between quiet nature and lively people. This itinerary is more or less relaxed, and suitable for a solo traveler or maybe up to three people. It contains little to no pre-booking, no ryokans, no expensive souvenir shopping, and lots and lots of public transportation. I hope the ease of this itinerary will demonstrate how relaxed Japan can be.

Plane ride + arrival

* This time around I packed like...nothing. 3 shirts, 3 long dresses, 2 pants, some undergarments, and a hat. Sunscreen, cosmetics, passport, some maple candies to hand out, presents for my friends, my goshiun book, a sketchbook, and some pens. My Switch for the plane ride. I think that was it lol. Just one small carry on, my backpack, and my  Uniqlo cross-body bag. Was more than enough.
* Took AA to Dallas, AA to Haneda. On the way back it was JAL to New York, AA to Toronto.
* All I have to say is, absolutely screw AA from the bottom of my heart. AA made the entire process, from using my flight credit (which I got from the last trip, see the end of that report hehe), to checking in, to using their app, to getting flight updates, to booking a meal, etc. insanely difficult, more so than the last time. Every time I needed to do something I had to call them and be on hold for 2 hours. Not to mention, the last time I called them to redeem my flight credit, I used their ""give us your number and we'll call you back to secure your place in line"" feature, and a SCAMMER CALLED ME BACK. When I went to the airport to sort out flight tickets, the attendant charged me in USD without informing me, and added extra fees that I had to call to get refunded. Upon time to check in, their app locked me out, and I was forced to become an AA Advantage member just to have access to my reservation. Just...absolutely screw AA. The flight there was mid, nothing to comment on.
* I arrived in Tokyo around 4PM, went through customs, bought a Shinkansen ticket to Hiroshima station on the spot, got my little eki-ben dinner, and went on my merry way on the 4.5 hour ride to Hiroshima. Arrived around 10:30PM to my hotel and crashed, then woke up with no jet lag at 8AM, yay! This time around I had a proper appetite (unlike my last trip), so I was able to eat well.
* Once again, getting a Welcome Suica from Haneda Terminal 3 was extremely easy. I took the subway (forgot what line) after. Even with my luggage (normal sized carry on, backpack, cross body bag) and a train full of people, it was easy. (I'm used to subways in Toronto). I put $100 on it at the start of the trip and only had to load $20 later. So about $120 for my 2 weeks.
* I'd prepared my Ubigi sim before coming (10 GB plan, used about 70% of it as I just used it as normal to watch videos and use google maps and google translate and everything). 0 issues with it. Absolutely amazing.

Hiroshima

* Itinerary:
   * 9th: Arrive at 10:30PM, sleep.
   * 10th: Mitaki-dera temple, cafe, Peace Museum, Peace Park, lunch, Atomic Bomb Dome, Hondori shopping street, long walk around Hiroshima, dinner
   * 11th: Itsukushima/Miyajima, cafe in Hiroshima, dinner in Hiroshima
* Mitaki-dera temple was a nice start to my day. Still a wee bit groggy from travel, just walking around the temple and getting my hunger back was nice. I accidently started doing the hike at the top before I climbed down, haha. There was like no one here, just old people hiking back down from the mountain by 9:30AMish.
* I highly recommend the museum. Personally, I loved it. It was like $2 and I bought the ticket on the spot. Not very busy. Very sobering, and really made me look at the city differently. I kept walking around the lively Hiroshima streets and bustling cafes thinking ""this was literally RUBBLE less than a hundred years ago..."". There are small monuments around the city, ex. some bent windows on display that were bent from the blast. What stayed in my heart the most were the artist depictions of the event. I won't spoil it, but that art -- as a fellow artist -- really moved me.
* Lots of great food and cafes in Hiroshima. Got to try a variety of things this time because I had an appetite, yay! Had Coco for the first time and it was just curry but on my hungry stomach I loved it. Went to a cafe with floor seating (blankets on the floor and pillows around it) and had a parfait. So relaxing!
* Miyajima was lovely and breathtaking. It was raining, and looked lovely in the rain. The deer were quite nice and funny here haha. I got to see the Tori both in the ocean and with the ocean receded, and both were lovely. Getting there was easy: I subwayed to Miyajimaguchi, and took the ferry for a couple bucks (ticket machines are available at the ferry port). I know there's another ferry from the Peace Park area, but apparently it's more expensive.
* I know people say to take the cable car up to Mount Misen, but I don't mind a little hike, so I told myself I'd take the easy trail up (Daisho-in route), but somehow got lost and ended up on the HARDEST TRAIL (Omoto route)!!?!? I'm actually stupid. I climbed stairs for over 2 hours! My thighs were like jelly by the end!! The views were lovely at the end but I was too out of breath to enjoy them (but I still enjoyed them). Took the cable car down for a rewarding view at the end of a hard hike. Honestly though, I don't regret it. I felt a lot of pride at the end of the day that I was able to accomplish that, and the tea and dessert I had at the end plus the lovely dinner I had really made up for it.
* I tried oysters on the island for the first time, and they were good, but I wouldn't have them again. I normally love all kinds of fish but they're not my cup of tea (fresh or fried).
* Went back to Hiroshima at around 4PM and relaxed for the rest of the day.
* Ah, I had Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki, but didn't like it as much as the classic okonomiyaki. Too much extra stuff going on, just give me my simple cabbage + batter + bonito + sauces!

Onomichi

* Itinerary:
   * 12th: Subway to Fukuyama, subway to Onomichi, leave my luggage at the hotel (pre-check-in), head out: Onomichi shopping arcade street, lunch, cat alley, check-in, dinner, walk around.
   * 13th: Bike reservation with Shimanami Bike Rental, biked half (4.5 hours) of the Shimanami Kaido (just to Setoda Port), ferry back, dinner.
   * 14th: Tomomoura, come back to Onomichi, rest and relax (as the past few days of hiking, hiking some more, climbing 2 hours of stairs, and biking for 4.5 hours destroyed me HAHA)
* Onomichi is BREATHTAKING. So breathtaking I kept whispering ""beauty like this has to be illegal, right? RIGHT?"" I could have relaxed there longer if I was with someone. Seeing boats everywhere, eating many lemon-themed things and drinking different orange juice ""shots"" (they're known for citrus), just inhaling that sharp sea air...amazing.
* Bike reservation through the Shimanami Kaido Bike Rental website was easy. I did feel the need to book about 2 weeks in advance as by then most bikes seemed to be taken (though they apparently have some day of, I didn't want to risk it). I booked a city bike (with a basket) but on the spot asked if I could take a cross bike and they said yes. Got my bike and was on my way!
* People make the biking route out to be intimidating, but it's not. I haven't biked in years and am not particularly active beyond swimming once a week and walking 10k steps twice or thrice a week. I easily biked half-ish of it to the Setoda tourist information center, dropped off my bike, then walked \~10 minutes to Setoda Port to take the ferry back at 5PM. There are convenience stores and ice cream along the way, and I stopped once or twice. To go uphill to the bridges, I walked my bike 10ish minutes or less up the hill (easy mode lol I know my limits), then rode across the bridge, no e-bike needed. I didn't explore much of the island beyond the main recommended route as I just didn't really care/didn't have much energy/was conscious of time. The route was so breathtaking that I think at some point my eyes got tired of breathtaking views haha.
* In short, literally grab your bike and go. There's nothing else to it. (There's a bike-friendly ferry you have to take that's 180 yen that was a bit hard to spot, but otherwise easy peasy).
* The ferry back was the most magical experience of my LIFE! Only like 10 of us on it, and it was 45 MINUTES OF BLISS!!! I kept blinking, and blinking again, spinning around in circles on the ferry like a crazy person, drinking in the view. So much cold sea air made me so tired at the end lol I passed out that night.
* Tomonoura, the ""town of Ponyo"" that supposedly inspired Hayao Miyazaki to make Ponyo, was a lovely little afternoon visit. Subway 20 minutes from Onomichi station to Fukuyama station, then bus to Tomonoura, took about an hour. Was nice to stop there for 3ish hours, but not much to do but admire the boats and have a nice lunch at a lovely cafe overlooking the sea. Took the same bus back, did some shopping at the Fukuyama station (my favourite part of Japan are the stations), and relaxed.

Kobe

* Itinerary:
   * 15th: Subway to Shin-Osaka, lunch with an old friend, shinkansen to Shin-Kobe (non-reserved). Leave bags at hostel (Guest House Maya), chinatown, Kobe harborland, simply a lot of walking around, back to hostel for check-in, Kobe mosque, Sannomiya station, Nada shopping street, Nada Onsen
   * 16th: Kitano neighbourhood, Kobe Gardens, lunch, Mount Rokko for sunset, dinner, Nada Onsen again
   * 17th: Arima onsen, walk around Kobe harborfront again, dinner
* My first time in a hostel, except this hostel didn't feel much like a hostel according to other people there lol. But the ""clientele"" were extremely shy and introverted so I only spoke to three people. Regardless, lovely place!
* Nice seeing a mosque in Japan. Had Indonesian food here for only the second time in my life and it was delicious. I also had the Japanese version of south Asian food (just a basic chicken curry that looked like a Japanese version of butter chicken, with a giant naan and a salad set cause of course it's Japan and you gotta have the set meals) and it was so amazing I had to stop myself from inhaling it all!!! AHH!
* I thought I wouldn't like the gardens 'cause I'm not a big flower person, but I loved them! Spent like 3 hours there, had some ice cream, it was nice. Just had to walk up, buy a ticket ($20), and I was on my way.
* Sannomiya station was probably my favourite place to be in Kobe. Again, I just love Japanese stations! Large, many shops, hustle and bustle, good eats, trains, what's not to love?
* Loved all the onsens. I brought the towel I rented from the hostel for 100 yen. Arima onsen was easy to get to. For some reason, Reddit makes it seem like a huge adventure for which you HAVE to book a ryokan yada yada...no, it was an easy day-trip! Just grabbed a bus from Sannomiya station (had to buy a ticket from the counter, but used my Suica on the way back) and I was on my way. Dropped right in the middle of the area, like a 10 min walk away from the onsen. Went to the gold onsen (the dark iron water) and was so heated up after that I decided against doing the second onsen (like, I'd already washed and dried, I wasn't gonna get wet AGAIN). Had a nice teishoku lunch (probably my favourite Japanese food), walked around to look at the stores, had their famous carbonated cracker for 100 yen, and went back to Kobe on the same bus, easy peasy.
* I didn't have Kobe beef (I'm not a big beef fan in general), and I didn't see Himeji (too lazy, and indifferent to castles).
* There's apparently a beautiful spot on Mount Rokko where you can see the best sunset ever, but the hiking map was so confusing (or maybe I'm stupid) because I walked in a circle and couldn't find it. So it's okay, I watched the sunset from the other side facing away from it lol, was still awesome.
* I liked Kobe's vibes a lot. Very relaxed, people are chill, easy transportation, water is lovely, food is awesome, etc. I thought it would be similar to Osaka but it was actually unique, and I'm really glad I stayed a few nights.

Tokyo

* Itinerary:
   * 18th: Shinkansen from Shin-Kobe to Shin-Tokyo. Leave luggage at hotel, walk around, prepare gifts and write letters for friends, walk around Shinjiku and Shibuya, play lots of arcade games and gacha.
   * 19th: All day with my online friend in Kichijouji. Breakfast, walk, swan boat ride in the park, cafe, draw, play video games, more walking in Kichijouji park, shopping, dinner, chai and drawing, talking, head back.
   * 20th: All day with my other online friend in Ikebukuro. Breakfast, then camp out in a karaoke room for everything other than karaoke (movies, drawing, talking, eating). Dinner, then head home.
   * 21st: Enoshima. Sea candle, caves, shopping street, watch the sunset.
   * 22nd: Last-minute shopping day. Kagurazaka for cafe, Nakano Broadway (wanted the classic Japanese women's loafers that school kids wear), sushi making workshop that I got to attend for free due to my hotel (Sakura Hotel Hatagaya), gaming in Shinjiku until 10PM, pack
   * 23rd: Early flight home (11AM)
* I highly, highly, highly recommend Kichijouji! The loveliest little park I've been to! The swan ride was 700 yen in total (so 350 yen per person) and was cute. There are a lot of little cafes and shopping to do. There was a cafe called Chai Break that was shockingly authentic despite being run by native Japanese people. Like I walked in and went ""what Pakistani/Indian brewed this?!?"" It smelled and tasted very traditional, was a nice surprise!
* My friend booked the karaoke room for us. I didn't know you can use them for other purposes. Apparently people even book them for remote work, she told me. She often uses it to draw (?). She brought a movie with her and we used the DVD player the room came with lmao...and drew, and talked, and laughed. We were there for like 5 hours or more but when it came time to pay I only owed her like $12? Crazy cheap.
* I can't tell what I loved more, Kamakura (from last year) or Enoshima (from this year). Different vibes for sure. Enoshima was less lively, more quiet and relaxing. I don't understand the elevator thing. I bought the 1100 yen Enoshima pass that gives you access to a bunch of stuff (sea candle, caves, elevators, I guess the gardens or something?) but never even needed to use the elevator. The path I took had such gentle elevation climb that by the time I got to the stairs going down I thought ""when the hell did I gain all this elevation?"" lol. So escalators were unnecessary (at least for me). Bought some ""sea glass"" candy here and it was yummy, nice to have while staring at the ocean into the great void beyond. I stayed for sunset; it was cloudy and the sunset was not impressive and I couldn't see Mount Fuji, but I didn't care about any of that in the first place (I was there primarily for the ocean, as Toronto only has Lake Ontario) so still had a great time.
* If you like anime stuff, I liked Nakano Broadway a hundred times better than Akihabara. Tons of good merch, which I would have bought except I'm not a big anime fan (except DBZ, but shockingly finding good ass DBZ merch was like finding a needle in a haystack, ugh!). I bought the classic brown women's school loafers here for \~$50. Conducted the shoe search and transaction easily enough in Japanese, don't know about shoe shopping in English, but probably wouldn't have a problem using Google translate.
* Scared to game alone? Think again! Most people I see in an arcade are gaming alone! Even when I go to arcades with friends back in Toronto we inevitably split up and play whatever we want alone, then regroup. So I shamelessly danced away on all manner of dance games (Dance Rush was my fave), and did drumming games, rhythm games, crane games, and more. Lots of fun!

Misc.

* I had learned a lot more Japanese this time (for fun, as an intellectual exercise) so I was shocked at my ability to speak and listen. I talked in Japanese with friend 1 for 12 hours using minimal google translate, and 8 hours with friend 2!! The entire time I was speaking I was like ""is this actually coming out of my mouth right now?"" lmaooo.
* All transactions were conducted in Japanese; I was never once spoken to in English (actually, there was one time someone INSISTED on using English when I kept replying in Japanese. Some random non-Japanese convenience store worker, who also hovered around me while shopping, kept asking me if I had everything, then took the 7-11 smoothie out of my hand without asking and ran the machine for me. I stood there dumbfounded and eventually shrugged lol. Helicopter employee much?). I was handed Japanese menus, spoken to in Japanese, etc. throughout my trip, despite obviously not looking Japanese, which was fun because I was able to greatly improve my listening and speaking throughout my trip. Someone asked if I lived there, and when I said I didn't, they said my intonation was native-sounding, so maybe that's why! Yay, validation!
* I used a LOT of cash. Took out about $350 (or was it $400?) by the end of the trip. Needed this for clothes, food, games, reloading Suica, etc.
* My hotels were: Tokoyo Inn Hiroshima Stadium Eki (Hiroshima), Hotel Alpha One Onomichi (Onomichi), Guest House Maya (Kobe hostel), Sakura Hotel Hatagaya (Tokyo). All were great, 0 complaints, no comments.
* Regarding luggage, there was no point where I had to carry it around anywhere except from hotel A to hotel B. The easiest thing to do is to arrive at your hotel, ask to store it, then leave and return for check-in. This was true every place I went.
* I didn't buy much this time. My purchases were literally: skirt, Moomin pjs, misc. dbz things (like gacha, stickers), misc. gacha, matcha Kit Kat, random Daiso shit (a hat, a swimming cap cause I can never find one in Toronto, this cool thing that lets you reseal chip bags), kid-friendly chopsticks for my nieces, a hand-held fan for my mom...I think that was literally it HAHA.
* I spent so much money on food omg. I ate GOOD. I would highly recommend you guys try non-Japanese food in Japan. Pizzas, spaghetti, paninis, south asian food, Indonesian food, etc...very good, and a unique experience having the ""Japanese"" version of other cuisines. And regarding Japanese food, do have teishoku once! The little sets with a main protein like fish, rice, salad or pickled veggies, and miso soup. Probably my favourite Japanese food ever. My favourite dessert was a matcha tart in Ikebukuro station. I could have had 20 of those!
* I often ate at bakeries with a little coffee, for breakfast or an evening snack. Also my favourite part of Japan (ex. Little Mermaid bakery).
* I carried maple candies to hand out. My general rule was if someone asked me what country I was from, they got a candy lol. I didn't just give them out to random service workers, but if I bought from a small business run by one person and we chatted, I'd give them a candy. Had some lovely interactions just from this.

General solo travel comments/things I did differently:

* This time, I was extra mindful of moments I felt lonely or anxious. When I felt loneliness come on, I made it a point to seek bustling crowds, or walk into a Don Quixote. When I felt anxiety come on, I made it a point to grab a nice little sweet from 7-11 and watch my favourite show in my hotel. This meant I had an extremely smooth solo travel.
* This time, I did not put pressure on myself to draw. Last time, when I saw a beautiful scene, I felt pressure to make it look nice and colour it. This time I didn't bother bringing my coloured markers, just a black and blue pen, and I kept it panel (manga?) style. If I didn't wanna draw, I didn't draw. Doing this felt more authentic and less performative, less empty.
* This time, I didn't put pressure on myself to stay in places I didn't like. I went to Kagurazaka for example as I'd heard it was a cute neighbourhood, but got bored after one cafe and just...left lol. No regrets. Didn't go to Himeji either, no regrets.
* I made it a point to buy dessert from 7-11 almost every day. I also took a warm bath almost every day and it helped my aching feet. (Also, I got Dr. Scholl's walk longer insoles before my trip and they really helped!)
* I brought prunes, and had one soaked in water for 15 minutes every night. I was nice and regular this time, heehee!
* Solo travel taught me that to truly feel fulfilled in life, I need: creative stimulation, intellectual stimulation, a cup of tea with a snack, a friend to talk to, and an identity anchor (ex. being Canadian, or being Muslim, or whatever identity feels like ""home""). That's it. Vacation is really fun, but for me, longer than 2 weeks would have me feeling empty. I'm excited to get back to my daily pursuits that bring me fulfillment (cooking, working, drawing).

(If I think of anything else, I'll add it later).

Overall, I would say my second trip was successful! Relaxing, saw unique places and did unique things, fulfilling, and great! I feel blessed to have been able to go again!",33,1748191201.0,JapanTravel,12,0.97,False

I thought my heart won't flutter like it did the first time I saw you, I was right, it didn't. But it burned with something I don't know. It burned with something familiar but forgotten. It could be a coincidence, I never thought I'd saw you there. Whenever I go out I was always looking out 'cause I might find you but I never find you, yet in that moment where I least expected us to be in one space, I saw you, in your most simple form, in your most authentic look, but I thought you look amazing just like the first time I met you. My heart didn't flutter but something inside me became ablaze, a desire perhaps. A desire to be a better person so I can say that I deserve to talk to you or even just be near you. I saw you, you didn't look my way but I'm glad you didn't. I'd probably crumble. My hands were already sweaty and cold just by the glimpse of you, one look is all it took. I thought maybe it was the coffee I was drinking but I've had a lot of coffee before and it didn't made me do that. I'm still in denial. I like you even from afar. That's enough for me, to just be able to see you, even if it's just for a moment, even from a reflection. Really, I thought I'd see you in another hike. I wasn't prepared to be in the same vicinity with you yesterday. I look like a moron and you look... Beautiful. Ahh, it makes me feel things I didn't know I can still feel. I hope it's alright to feel this way without you knowing. I hope you let me. But if you're bothered, I'll.. Ugh I can't. Fck! But I will stop if you ask me to. I'm sorry for feeling this way.

•Voice notes describing your plans.
	
•Photos of your outfit, coffee, perfume bottle, or shoes.
	
•Clips of you walking through town, browsing a store, or applying lip gloss.

	
3.Establish Clear Boundaries:

Be explicit about what this dynamic is:
“This space is for devoted viewers who send money to witness my world—not to direct it, and certainly not to sexualize it.”

Use pinned posts or story highlights to define expectations.
	
4.Require Tribute First:

No “free samples.” You’re not a content creator. You’re a muse.

Set a minimum tribute to initiate contact or access updates:
Example: “Minimum 15 tribute to follow my day in photos. I’m not here to chat—I’m here to live, funded by those who admire me.”
	
5.Post With Purpose:

Show the results of their funding. Make it known that what they’re seeing is made possible by their devotion.

	
•“Out for sushi on your dime 🥂”
	
•“These shoes? A tribute well spent.”
	
•“Taking you with me today—silently, of course.”

	
6.Be Mysterious, Not Distant:
You don’t have to overshare. A daily photo and one-line caption can feel intimate.
You’re not ignoring them—you’re letting them exist quietly in your world.
	
7.Offer Optional Consistency:
Create low-effort, high-value packages:

	
•“Daily Glimpses – 100/month for private photos and lifestyle updates”
	
•“Grocery Goddess – 25 to fund my next haul, I’ll show you the bag”
	
•”Silent Walk-Along – 40 to sponsor my afternoon out, you’ll get a short clip and two photos”

	
8.Honor High-Value Subs:

Reward consistency and big tributes with small gestures: a thank-you note, a personalized photo, or first peek at your next update. Make them feel seen—never owed.
	
9.Don’t Chase. Don’t Beg. Don’t Lower:

Your lifestyle doesn’t pause when the money slows. Keep living. The right subs will return. Your consistency is your power.
	
10.Protect Your Energy:

Use block buttons liberally. Filter messages. Demand respect in tone and tribute. You are the one being served.

Bonus Sample Caption Ideas:

•”You funded this mood 💋”
	
•“Drenched in your devotion, one photo at a time”
	
•“You exist for this POV—my world, my rules, your money”

•“Imagine being outside this life. Couldn’t be me.”

ich bin gerade dabei, meine erste eigene Kaffeemarke zu launchen: TropiCoffee – ein Kaffee, der fruchtig schmeckt. Kein Sirup, kein Instant-Mix – sondern richtige Kaffeebohnen mit Orangen-, Blaubeer-, Erdbeer- oder Kokos-Aroma.

Ich weiß, es klingt im ersten Moment ziemlich verrückt (das dachte ich auch 😅), aber das Feedback aus meinem Umfeld war überraschend positiv. Es soll kalt oder heiß trinkbar sein, komplett ohne Zucker, vegan.

Handgeröstet in Österreich, Bohnen aus Brasilien.

Was denkt ihr:  
Würdet ihr sowas probieren?  
Ist Fruchtgeschmack im Kaffee ein No-Go oder genau das, was der Markt braucht?  
Was wäre ein Geschmack, den ihr mal trinken wollt?

Freu mich mega über ehrliches Feedback – sowohl kritisch als auch begeistert. Und wenn jemand neugierig ist – ich kann euch gern den Link zur Launch-Seite dalassen.

Bilder kann ich hier leider keine posten, ist auch auf der Seite zu sehen.

Edit & Aufklärung:

Die Bohnen werden in Ried handgeröstet und nach dem Rösten mit natürlichen Aromen veredelt. Somit schmeckt der Kaffee nicht sauer oder süß sondern im Nachgang nur nach dem jeweiligen Aroma.

1kv6owc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kv6owc/assess_if_the_euhomy_imfp_ice_maker_stands_out/,Assess if the EUHOMY IM-FP Ice Maker Stands Out: Comprehensive Review,"The **EUHOMY IM-FP Ice Cube Maker Machine Countertop** has been an interesting addition to my kitchen, and after running it daily for a couple of weeks, I can confidently say it's a handy gadget for ice enthusiasts. This portable ice maker has a range of noteworthy features alongside a few quirks, but overall, it delivers on its promise of convenience and efficiency.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact design of this ice maker immediately caught my eye. Measuring 14.2 x 9.9 x 14.6 inches and weighing just under 22 pounds, it slots perfectly onto my countertop without monopolizing space. Its sleek, modern stainless steel aesthetic pairs well with practically any decor, whether it's in a cozy kitchen or a lively office breakroom. Additionally, the LCD digital display makes it user-friendly, with all the necessary functions easily accessible at the press of a button. The clarity of the screen reduces guesswork, which I found particularly useful when trying to figure out settings during initial use.

**Performance and Ice Production**  
This countertop marvel churns out 24 crystal-clear ice cubes per cycle, with each cycle taking around 13 minutes. That means, if I run it consistently, it can produce up to 45 pounds of ice in just one day – a dream come true when hosting parties or filling multiple coolers for a barbecue. I ran it during a family gathering last week, and there was never a shortage of ice, even with everyone grabbing cubes for chilled drinks. Another perk is being able to adjust the thickness of the ice cubes. Whether I want thinner cubes for cocktails or denser ones for iced coffee, this machine handles it all seamlessly.  

[Ready to buy EUHOMY IM-FP Ice Cube Maker Machine Countertop? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b09133yzl4/)  

**Versatile Water Options**  
What sets this ice maker apart is the option to add water in two ways. It includes a 3.2-liter water tank for regular refills, but you can also attach a water bottle (less than 2 inches in diameter) as an alternative. Needless to say, I’ve used the water tank option most, but it is great to know the versatility exists. This feature has been particularly helpful when we took the ice machine to a beach house rental that lacked filtered water in the tap. No hassle—just attach a water bottle and let the machine do its thing.

**Food-Safeness and Quiet Operation**  
The materials used are food-safe and anti-corrosive, which gives peace of mind when handling ice for drinks my kids will enjoy. At around 45 decibels, this machine is quieter than I expected. Even with the ice production process running consistently in the background, it doesn’t create an annoying hum that disrupts daily activities or even my overly sensitive cat. Bonus!

**Pros**  
- The dual water input options are a game-changer for flexibility.  
- Quick production cycles ensure there's always enough ice on hand.  
- User-friendly LCD screen and accessible functions.  
- Produces clear, solid ice cubes with adjustable thickness.  
- Lightweight and portable design allows it to be easily moved.  

**Flaws**  
- As great as this ice maker is, the size of the ice basket is relatively small compared to the volume of ice it produces. I found myself frequently emptying the ice into a cooler or bag to keep the cycle going uninterrupted.  
- While having an automatic cleaning function is a plus, I noticed it still requires semi-regular manual cleaning to avoid lingering residues or build-up in hard-to-reach areas.  
- Using it in a high-humidity environment can sometimes result in the stored ice melting partially before I get to it, though this isn’t entirely the ice maker’s fault.  

**Product Competitors**  
When looking at comparable options like the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker, it’s clear the EUHOMY IM-FP Ice Cube Maker holds its own. While the Opal is widely regarded as the king of nugget ice makers and offers Wi-Fi connectivity, its hefty price tag may not appeal to everyone. On the other hand, EUHOMY provides the essentials with a good balance between price and performance. Another worthy rival, the Vremi Ice Maker, is slightly more affordable but lacks the adjustable thickness settings found in this product. Where EUHOMY really shines, though, is the 45-pound production capacity, which trumps other brands in its class.  

**Affordable Quality**  
With appliances like this, what you’re paying for is convenience and capacity. Compared to constantly stocking up on bagged ice or relying on subpar freezer ice makers, this product feels like a smart investment. While I’ve come across pricier models that aim for the “luxury” market segment, this one offers premium features like adjustable cube thickness and a reservation timer without overburdening your wallet. Value for money seems spot on here, as it addresses the needs of both everyday users and occasional entertainers.

1.Understand Your Role:

You’re not buying content. You’re supporting a lifestyle. Your reward is the privilege of watching her enjoy the world, especially through your tribute.
	
2.Mindset Matters:

•You’re here to serve, not to control.
	
•You enjoy funding her coffee, her day trips, her outfits—not demanding anything in return.
	
•You get pleasure from watching her use your money to thrive and shine.
	
3.Initiate with Respect:
	
•Start with a humble introduction and a tribute. No “hey” or demands.
	
•Example: “Goddess, I admire your presence. I’d love to send a token of appreciation for a glimpse into your world. May I send a tribute?”
	
4.Tribute First, Always:
	
•No tribute = no access. Don’t expect free content.
	
•Even a small gesture speaks volumes at first. Be consistent.
	
5.How to Send:
	
•Ask her preferred payment platform: CashApp, PayPal, Gift Cards, etc.
	
•Be discreet, respectful, and never ask for discounts or negotiations.
	
6.What to Expect:
	
•Subtle updates: a photo of her morning latte, a clip of her walking downtown, a selfie in the mirror before she steps out.
	
•You get to witness her life unfold thanks to you.
	
•Never rush her or ask for “more.” She decides what and when.
	
7.Support Her Vision:
	
•Compliment her taste, her energy, her independence.
	
•Want her to go out more? Send funds for it—“Here’s 50 to treat yourself and take us with you 🖤.”
	
8.Stay in Your Lane:
	
•This isn’t sexual. No lewd comments, no begging for nudes.
	
•If she sets boundaries, honor them.
	
9.Keep It Consistent:
	
•Regular tributes go a long way. Even small weekly tips build trust.
	
•Say things like, “This is just so you never forget who’s watching from afar.”
	
10.Gratitude is the Currency:

	
•Thank her often, even for allowing you to watch.

•Make her feel like the main character—and you, the adoring fan behind the lens.

Bonus: Sample First Tribute Message

Dear [Her Title — Goddess, Miss, Queen, etc.],
I’m a voyeuristic sub who finds deep fulfillment in seeing you live your best life. I’m not here to ask—only to offer. I’d be honored to contribute so you can enjoy something beautiful today. If allowed, I’ll send a tribute right away and quietly admire how you use it. 🖤

A friend recommended the Discover it Student Cash Back card, so I applied and actually got approved with a super low limit. I’ve only had it a few days, but it already feels like a good pick. The app is easy to use, and I like that they give you cash back even on small stuff like coffee and textbooks. I also saw a couple of posts on Reddit saying they’re pretty forgiving if you’re new to credit.

Before this, I was mostly using a debit card and budgeting apps. I didn’t think about building credit until I realized it affects stuff like renting apartments or even getting a decent phone plan. I’ve seen people in other threads recommend secured cards too, but I’m trying to avoid putting down a deposit if I don’t have to.

Between surveys, cashback apps, and complicated affiliate systems, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. After testing out countless platforms that promised the moon but delivered pennies, I finally stumbled upon something *different*. That’s when I found [Revolve](https://refer-earn-sagguamarjot.replit.app/), and trust me, it changed the way I look at earning online.

# What Is Revolve?

Revolve is a simple yet powerful platform that allows you to **earn real cash rewards** by doing three things:

1. **Viewing ads**
2. **Referring friends**
3. **Purchasing products through their links**

It’s free to sign up, and the user-friendly interface means you can start earning in minutes — no technical skills required.

# My Personal Experience

At first, I was skeptical. I’ve seen far too many “earn money online” platforms that require ridiculous time investments with little to no return. But what stood out to me about Revolve was its transparency and simplicity. I signed up through this link: [https://refer-earn-sagguamarjot.replit.app/](https://refer-earn-sagguamarjot.replit.app/) and decided to give it a shot.

Within the first 24 hours, I earned a few bucks just by watching ads during my coffee break. Nothing groundbreaking, but it was passive and easy — and more than I ever earned on similar apps. The real magic began when I shared my referral link with a few friends. The referral system is powerful: you earn a percentage from every friend who joins through you and engages with the platform. Before I knew it, I was stacking up some decent side cash — enough to cover a monthly streaming subscription or two.

And when I made my first purchase through their product links and got a cashback reward — I knew I had found a hidden gem.

# Why It Works

* **No complicated rules** — everything is explained clearly.
* **Real earnings** — Revolve pays in actual money, not points or tokens.
* **Passive potential** — once your referrals start earning, so do you.
* **Great for students, freelancers, and stay-at-home parents** — even if you’ve got just 15 minutes a day.

# Tips to Maximize Your Earnings

1. **Check in daily** to view new ads — they rotate regularly.
2. **Share your referral link** with people who actually want to earn.
3. **Use Revolve when buying online** — it’s an easy win.
4. **Stay consistent** — it adds up over time.

# Final Thoughts

Look, I won’t claim you’ll get rich overnight. But if you’re looking for a **real, no-BS way to earn extra cash**, Revolve is one of the best platforms I’ve used so far. Whether you're saving for something special or just want to make your scrolling time more productive, Revolve offers a smart way to do it.

1kv6gbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1kv6gbj/my_path_from_mba_rejections_to_mbb/,My path from MBA rejections to MBB,"tl;dr the trick for me was to get to schools' avg GMAT scores and have the patience to re-apply; too much time and money to not go to the school that meets your goals

Bit of a ramble on my part but hoping my story can help give people some direction. This is not a prescriptive model - what I did won't work for everyone. My background is a bit unique, so I'd rather hold details to remain anonymous. Fairly avg profile though - non minority fwiw. 

The first time I applied to M7 and a slew of T10/15, it was with a respectable but ultimately mediocre GMAT. Essays were fine but in hindsight could have been better. I generally got rejected / waitlisted without much hope. While I could have probably gone to a good T20/25, I was targeting MBB and knew that would be an uphill battle. I took stock and decided to put my plans on pause for a year. The MBA was too much time and money to go to a school that wouldn’t put me in a position to meet my goals. So, I buckled down on the GMAT and this time used Target Test Prep (unsponsored shoutout), which turned things around. I re-applied to schools with a 720 and refined essays. Had some wonderful choices in the end and ultimately went to CBS ($$). 

Have been at MBB a few years now and if I had to go back and do it all again, here's my quick download:

-get your test score on lock; nothing really matters imo until it's where you want it to be

-re-apply the following year if you don't get into places that don't meet your goals

-reflecting on our own recruiting, MBB is unfortunately tough once you get past T15; it’s possible, just tougher and regionally based 

-some schools are consulting powerhouses (e.g., Tuck), but the lower down the ranks you go, the more geographically siloed it tends to be (e.g., I think it's tougher for Fuqua to go to the northeast than it is for Kellogg students to go to various offices, simply due to internal office pull); will admit this is anecdotal on my part though

-first semester of MBA is entirely about recruiting; buckle down first semester so that you can enjoy the next three

-that said, don't be sharp elbowed; no one likes the overly competitive person trying to speak first at recruiting events and it's cringe

-practice doing coffee chats and delivering your casual pitch before you meet with the firms

-during recruiting, be genuine and warm; your background/experience isn't something I overly scrutinize during the first meets

-when it comes time to drill down, just speak confidently and show that you made an impact; the vibe is generally ""would I feel comfortable sending this person to a client alone""

-once you start in consulting, kill your first few studies/cases and build up your reputation; managers being able to speak positively about you to others makes staffing much easier",17,1748190030.0,MBA,1,0.88,False
1kv6fs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1kv6fs7/black_coffee/,Black Coffee,"When I was seventeen, I worked the late shift at a diner off the highway. It was quiet most nights—just regulars and truckers. One night, a man came in just before closing. Clean-shaven, polite, a little too quiet. He sat at the far booth and ordered coffee. Black. No sugar.

I remember he watched me the whole time. Not in a flirty way. Just... studying. I laughed nervously, made small talk. He smiled, but it never reached his eyes. When I brought the check, he said, “You know, you shouldn’t walk to your car alone. It’s not safe out there.”

I thanked him, trying to be polite, and said my coworker would be out soon and we'd drive home together. It was a lie. The cook had already left out the back, I was alone. Something about him gave me chills. He paid for his coffee and gave me one last cold smile before leaving, the jingle from the door knocking me out of the almost trance like state I was in. I locked the door immediately, and even though I felt a little silly, waited in the kitchen until sunrise and the arrival of the breakfast staff.

Two years later, I saw his mugshot on the news. Same face. Same cold smile that didn't reach his eyes. He'd been arrested for murdering five girls across the state. Diner workers. Always approached them late at night. Always polite. Always coffee, black.

I still have the check he signed. Something made me keep it.

No name. Just a smiley face, drawn in the corner, with the words 'stay safe'.

I realize I may be overstepping and if so, that's on me. I know I have been here a lot, likely in not great mental health and have had some not so great interactions. Yes I know I am prone to being overly sensitive and when in a spiral thought pattern I can get very self disparaging, sometimes argumentative even if I don't see it in the moment. I am trying to grow and address those things. That being said, I have something to say. If you would like to read it, go ahead. If not, you don't have to. Message however you want, opinions are your own and I will respect them all. Ok.....

I am at a point in my life that is so strange and bizarre that it doesn't feel real. I am typing this after spending the entire night before reflecting and talking to others, please excuse any typos, about my life and all it entails. Here I am at 30 years old, drinking some coffee and thinking about my gender and where I want to go moving forward. Never a thought the little boy I used to be would ever have imagined. Hell, sometimes I don't even imagine it now. 

I won't bore you with my life story but when my world came crashing down around half a year ago, gender was a crucial part of it. Was it the cause of everything? The mythical egg cracking? No, but it felt mythical in scope and not in a pleasant way. It was more of a crippling and agonizing grief, a deep gnawing pain in my chest. For the first time in years, I tried to listen to myself and began to realize my gender was not as secure as I thought. That being a man may or may not be for me, and that seeing and hearing about the journeys of so many transgender people brought all sorts of emotions into focus. 

The happiness and joy I felt at watching men and woman love themselves enough to do what they needed to feel whole, radical self love at it's finest. The camaraderie I felt meeting and talking with some of you, arguably pestering you too much. But also jealous of people who ""had it better than me"", the individuals who were steadfast in their vision. Those who didn't falter. Those who seemed to pass effortlessly, have a supporting family, work, etc. I am ashamed to say envy colored a lot of wonderful stories and ugly shade of green. 

I learned that I am not stuck in this box of masculinity that I thought I was, that I had all the options open to me. That masculinity and femininity were whatever we wanted them to be, that all gender is truly at the end of the day a load of bullshit, that if I wanted to change anything all I needed to do was take a pill and I could have it. Something so small could change my entire life, like throwing a people in a pond, a small thing that could ripple out and change it all. In my head, I thought it would be a wonderful realization, instead it scared the shit out of me. It was there, absolute freedom to do what I wished but with freedom comes the weight of consequences. Anything that happened after would be on my shoulders for better or worse, and I would have to own up to it. 

The thought scared me into the shadows, where I read all the books on the subject I could afford, workbooks studied until I cried, every corner of the internet scoured and stories read, countless sleepless and tears filled night spent not wanting this. At the time, I wanted to not have the knowledge. To go back into the box and live an ignorant life, but I couldn't. Pandora's Box was open and it took a large toll on my life, my focus, my well being. So I hid and worked on myself for six months, therapy to handle the thoughts, medications to handle the depression that came strolling in alone side my gender studies. After talking with countless people, lots of expensive therapy sessions, and the like, I realize all I wanted was some sort of validation. 

Some sort of story that would magically parallel mine, a person to say, ""I was just like you! You are valid and it's ok to be...... "". I don't think some validation is bad but I was aching for it, for someone to take these thoughts away. To give me a definitive answer, really I wanted someone to take the power of choice away from me. A voice that could guide me down a predestined path where I was free of all responsibilities, where I could point to some titan or godlike authority figure and say ""See? They told me to do so, so I am."" It was naive but I can own up to it. 

Needless to say, I never found that. Instead I found unease and anxiety, specifically about being a bit unsure about such a large life decision. HRT and transitioning seemed like such a mountain to cling and I HAD to be super duper sure I was ready. Lots of people told me they never doubted their choice, so why was I? When people told me to just try it, why did I get so scared and defensive? Again I think it came down to agency and having the power in my hands. 

After some realization and lots of reflection, I think I came to a few big thoughts that seem to have helped me. It is ok, to be scared and nervous. This is a big change and I can treat it as such. People get nervous about big stuff all the time! Like a new job, getting married, moving, etc. I would never fuss at someone for being a bit on the fence about it, yet I was hating myself for not being totally sure. That's ok and I can admit to myself that it's alright to be scared. 

I don't inherently hate my masculinity in all forms or my masculine body for that matter. Sure I wish it was more androgynous but everyone has things they are insecure about. I don't feel like a woman deep down, I don't see a girl in the mirror looking back, I do not have a little Jasmine (my feminine name) screaming and crying to be set free. I have the power to make my gender and how I feel about it however I want. A blend of what I like from both and that's very freeing. There are still concerns about looks and vain things, I am only human, but it's ok. 

I see this more as a want vs. a need and I think it's just as valid. Is it bad to say that in my mind, I would want to have a more feminine body and expression? That I feel like at the moment I want to figure it and out see for myself? That I was guided a lot more by curiosity than an urge to change myself? Someone people may not agree but I don't really care, this is my life. 

I don't need to have an aching pain to be something else for my want to be a real thing. Being transgender isn't tied to pain and suffering, and while many people see this as a need, I don't and I can accept that. There is a fear of ""getting it wrong"", of a sunken cost fallacy of going to far or too deep, of just not getting the ""traditional experience"". I realize that's all bullshit. This isn't going from one side to another it's a journey, and mine may be simple, it may hard and full of twists and turns, lots of doubling back and God knows what else. Would it be easy? I doubt it but even in the ""worst case scenario"" I will have learned about myself and gotten some answers and that's not nothing. If I end up ""regretting it"" at some point, so be it. It's an informed choice and I roll with the consequences of my choice.

So here I am, sitting on my couch already two sessions into my beard removal with an endocrinologist appointment in about two weeks. I thought I would be feeling so much dread and self hatres, so much anxiety and nervousness but I don't. The nerves are still there, this is a big thing but for once I am a bit excited. Will it work for me? Is it something that will change my life?  Will I end up liking HRT and become a trans woman? Hate it and end up going back to cis normal or some GNC way of life? There are a lot of questions but I can live with those, all I need to do is trust myself and love myself enough to see how this goes. To feel how the next chapter of my life unfolds and learn to accept that it may be messy, it may not be what I expect, but it is MY story. My unique lived experience and all I need to do is be content with it, to find some sort of wholeness and peace (regardless of where it ends up taking me), to finally get some quiet. This is MY story. It will be beautiful and it will be enough. ",1,1748189913.0,TransLater,0,1.0,False

I have a huge backyard and am located near vineyards and glorious Oaks.  I’m struggling to grow more accustomed to the squirrels, lizards, ants and other creatures that share this space.  I also had rodents do $2K in damage by eating the wiring in my car. In the garage!  Fortunately, exterminators cleared and sealed the garage. Anyway, the last few days I’ve heard rustling in a bush near my spa outside.  More rustling than a bird, less than a squirrel. Yesterday, I saw a mouse near this bush seeming struggling with something in the leaves.  I was so unnerved I ran into the house and paced for a bit.  When I went back out - no sign of this rodent.  I termed it a “rat” and was unglued as I researched what to do. I read that peppermint oil is a good deterrent so I grabbed my premixed spray bottle and attacked under and around the bush.  Later that day, as the sun was setting I heard the noise again.  I grabbed the bottle and made a second pass.  Sure enough, a fat mouse came staggering out of the bush, and began waddling across the yard as though it was drunk. I followed the dang thing - spraying it as we went.  I took the top off and emptied the bottle right on him in a frenzy of freaking out.  I ran back inside and went to bed.  This morning, on the rock portion of my yard is a dead mouse. After a cup of coffee; I verified the death and began stressing about — NOW WHAT? It occurred to me that maybe a bird would grab the carcass (it was out in the open) but got busy agonizing about how to get rid of it.  30 minutes later I looked in the yard and the dead mouse is gone. I thank the universe for closing the circle for me and thanks to you for letting me share!  I realize the animal was likely sick and dying already - I hastened its demise by stressing it out.

This is me in Professor Kukui cosplay (with a shirt bc I was at work lol): https://imgur.com/a/qhxvjqo

About me: I am a librarian working in Texas but looking to move away. I have no girlfriend, wife, or children to worry about, so I’m free to move wherever makes the most sense for me. I joke that there are three pillars to my personality: Pokemon, soccer, and ASOIAF. They are by far the things that I enjoy most but I have a lot of interests. Im a bit of a creative dilettante; I enjoy singing, acting, writing, composing, podcasting and have recently taken up drawing though I’m not very good at it. I speak English and Spanish fluently and am starting to move beyond “elementary” level in French. I am also learning Irish and Japanese, but I am in absolute baby-language with those. I’m a big reader and lately I’ve gotten into nonfiction science books, but I’m not above popular stuff. I relatively recently read the first ACOTAR book and Fourth Wing and liked both of them fine though I must admit I have basically no desire to keep reading them 😅. 

I am a vegetarian so I cook a bit bc I live in small town Texas lol. I also workout five to six times a week, I love coffee and have a bit of an aesthetic eye so I really like fashion. I wouldn’t say I’m like “into” fashion, but I dress well. My style is somewhere at the intersection of 1950s slacks and suspenders type stuff, dark academia style, mixed with my own personal preference for modernity. But don’t get me wrong- I’m just as likely to wear a t-shirt and jeans lol. The part that’s hard to get past for some people is that I really like jazz/swing music and swing dancing lol… I’m not great at it, but it’s very old time-y so there aren’t many people who’ve heard or can even pretend to be interested in the music I listen to. Im very into the 1950s aesthetic in particular, but don’t get me wrong; I am very progressive. I can look like a tradhusband (is that a thing? I only ever see tradwife) but still support my LGBTQ+ and BIPOC kin. 

I’m financially stable but I’m nowhere near being able to support you, though the kind of woman I’m looking for probably wouldn’t want me to support her anyhow. I’ve lifted or am in the process of lifting myself out of generational poverty depending on how you define that. My mom is my hero; she came to the USA penniless and now helps train phlebotomists all across the country. It’s bc of her that I was able to make the most of my opportunities… or at least some of them lol.

About you: I don’t know! I don’t like trying to dictate what the world around me looks like. Besides being a futile effort, I like the whimsy of finding out who is out there and might enjoy getting to know someone like me. Of course, I’d have to be attracted to you, you’d have to be attracted to me and we’d have to be compatible in all the adult ways- that’s non-negotiable, but if you are very different from me but still found this intriguing, I’d love to know why and get to know you as well. Maybe we’ll hit it off, maybe one of us will ghost the other, maybe we’ll like each other just fine but there’s no real chemistry. Whatever happens, I appreciate you reading my little stream of consciousness post and hope you find someone you enjoy.
