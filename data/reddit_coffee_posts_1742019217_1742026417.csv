Since then I did 8 coltures (always negative), 8 vaginal swabs, 3 urethral swabs, 3 ultrasounds and one uroflussometry. I've seen three gyns and two urologists. Now my main symptoms are still there, but I randomly get nausea, my head spins, I feel weak, I have little appetite, and my bladder hurts when it's pressed upon; on Monday I had an excruciating pain in my urethra (like something was stuck there) that didn't go away with painkillers. I ended up urinating blood and my doctor said it ""might be positive"" because according to him I was passing a kidney stone. Since then I obviously still have every symptoms minus the urethral pain, which is only there sometimes when I pee.

No one is taking my symptoms seriously even though it's so debilitating to have to pee all the time and feel like your genitals are constantly on fire. I asked my doctor to write me a paper to admit me to the hospital urgently, which he refused to do. I already went to the ER once and one time I was told to drink more water because the colture was negative so I was making shit up. The other time they didn't even admit me in because despite having symptoms for 7 months it wasn't urgent because I had no fever. I don't know where to go. My mind is going to dark places like drinking enough coffee that I will start throwing up or shit like that so someone has to take me seriously.

I asked my parents if they could drive me to the ER yesterday, early in the morning so less people would be there, but ofc they didn't even wake me up and they are now saying I don't need to go because I didn't go to pee all night long (nocturia IS one of my symptoms but no every night and I used an heating pad to keep the pain at bay).

1jbpu4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jbpu4q/if_your_anxietycrying_etc_got_better_on/,"If your anxiety/crying etc got better on stimulants, what triggered your emotions beforehand? Needing to mask, or plain physical (i.e. PMDD) ?","So yes, I keep reading that for some, stimulants actually calm their anxiety etc. It baffles me honestly. But I spoke to someone who said, she only realized she had anxiety all day long, once she was on meds, cause she was a high masker and she finally didn‘t have to overthink leaving the house to go to work. 

Rather foreign concept to me I admit - thanks to my liberal parents I‘d say 🙏

Perso, I‘m actually low masking, I am chaotic, expressive (what is a filter ? 😅🤣🙄) and I tend to embrace that. Obviously that clashes with society at times, and so I developed naturally some hacks like have my key in the same place at the door, all my vitamins/amino acids visible, 10 alarms in the morning reminding me how much time I have left til i leave the house so I know where I‘m in my routine, etc. and I make my health a hyper focus (!) - so I cant quite say what it be like without that. Its just my way of bringing structure, and I wouldn‘t need the 10 alarms most days but for the days I dont want to leave bed, its very helpful and on the others I often work against those milestones unconciously ;). Also my job allows flexible working hours so I dont need to worry much about being on time.

Aside from that, I have strong R*S*D in some areas of my life, while not in others. And with the filter issue, strong emotions for small triggers are hm, what‘s s positive way of putting it? They keep me constantly engaged. They are fun in some ways, but like everything come with 2 sides, for me and others.

I also ofc have PMDD (40% of adhd women apparently do), which sparked my whole gut health journey (hello histamine, gluten, lectine and what not sensitivities). So essentially with the pmdd, a lot of my emotions are also hormonal driven (especially now in perimenopause) and I keep reading people saying during luteal their stimulants stop working. I got myself on HRT, btw can only recommend. 

But all this to say, I naturally usually avoid stimulants cause they make me hyper/create anxiety. I mean I can have a coffee once in awhile (and when I start a new job i drink it to better stack all the new input coming my way) but my body doesn’t like it overall. I also remember a highly depressed period (body was clearly in freeze & flight mode) in my early twenties, where I drunk Red Bull for like 6 months every morning (!) Wild for me, to even consider this now, my body must have really needed the input to function, I wouldn‘t otherwise ever touch smth like that willingly on the regular. 

I have tried Ritalin (1 day felt just normal, second had a huge crying.anxiety attack) and Medikinet (robotic but rather a little on the angry side, and the come doen resulted in crying for 3 days). I had antidepressants previously, which needed constant increasing. worsened gut health issues and killed my metabolism plus added 30kg to my scale. 

So, if you followed me til here - what drove your stimulation journey and(/or if by any chance you face similar experiences), what are your life or med choices or hacks ? ",1,1742023793.0,adhdwomen,10,1.0,False

It came accompanied by horrible sciatica-like pain in lower back, tailbone area, left pelvis and left leg. This was diagnosed in December to be endometriosis and it was found near my left ovary in ultrasound, explaining the left sided pains. I've taken desogestrel for two months for endo, and all the sciatica like symptoms, periods and pain have disappeared. However, the right stomach/rib pain hasn't ceased. It's not ""typical"" gallbladder pain, since it's not attacks, but instead a constant dull pain and a feeling that something extra is lodged under there. For example, I can't sleep on my stomach or sides, can't properly lean forwards, sitting is uncomfortable. It worsens throughout the day, acts up after I go to sleep, and then suddenly in the night during sleeping on my back, it disappears, until it reappears after waking up.

I had a stomach ultrasound few days ago and they found nothing, but a tiny ""good-quality"" polyp in my gallbladder which I shouldn't feel at all? My labs are fine. Coffee affects a bit and I've laid off it. Also I'm vegan and eat low-fat home cooked food. Don't drink or smoke. The dull pain has gotten worse this week, I know it's considered mild gallbladder symptom but I'm not able to do anything. Also for three days I've also had bad nerve-pulling pain in left shoulder and neck when breathing in.

This will be quick. My friends and I are at the airport. There’s little to no seats available as people want to be inconsiderate and take three seats to themselves. I’m talking several individual people lying horizontally on seats. I’m with two people, who I’ll call Z and L. L really needs a spot to do their homework, so we go to a cafe which has three spots to this table. 

I notice there’s a rag on the table. I don’t see anything else so I assume someone had just accidentally left it and set it aside. If it was a coat or a bag, I would have definitely assumed someone was already sitting there and not have taken the spot. Since it’s the only spot left, I grab it and set the luggage there. I’m in charge of luggage while my friends go grab food. 

Five minutes later, some guy comes and says I’ve taken his spot. I’m running on three hours on sleep so I’m confused and taken aback. I don’t know where he’s getting that from until he picks up the rag that I just notice has some sort of name on it (I’m really out of it and this is before I drank the coffee L got me lol). Z is the closest person to me. While Z is grabbing food and I call their name to see what I should do or where to move the luggage (I definitely couldn’t carry it on my own). The dude is getting more frustrated and keeps motioning for me to leave. I look back at him and shrug because I have no clue how I’m going to move it without L and Z’s help. Although there’s no seats inside, there are outside for single people. I tell I’m sorry but I’m not moving. He gets frustrated and leaves. 

I feel bad and Z said I should have just moved. So AITA? ",4,1742022655.0,AITAH,2,0.83,False

1jbphml,https://i.redd.it/8vhskl1iysoe1.jpeg,My shadow,"This is my little Velociraptor Isha, she is coming up on 7 months old. Just had her first heat. Since about 4 months we've been having some major troubles with territorial behaviour, and of course the nipping and barking.
We live in a self contained apartment above our friends who have just had a newborn baby girl.
Our backyard is pretty big, but we share it with our friends + baby. I have been watching closely with the baby and never leave them unsupervised.
She tends to bark ferociously at anyone who comes up into our apartment, and about 50/50 on people coming into the backyard.

She finished her first heat a few days ago, and the nipping, barking and mild aggression towards people has been getting worse. 

Yesterday we went out to lunch with my uncle and his 3 year old girl, Isha was on leash, and doing pretty well until she lunged at my niece and got a pretty light nip in on her leg. My neice dealt with it alright, but I could tell my uncle was pretty upset. 
This could've been avoided, but my dad was walking her past where my niece was sitting, and it all happened pretty quickly.

We now have a tricky decision to make, I've been taking most of the week away from work to make sure she's barely ever unsupervised, as she needs free roam of the backyard, which again, we share with my friends and their baby.

Shes walked heaps, comes with me on adventures, impulse and obedience trained daily, and socialised in various environments across the week. I play tug of war with her, throw frisbees and balls, and do lots of agility stuff with her.

But between the random, ear splitting barks, sometimes at nothing at all, the aggressive behaviour to anyone entering the home, even people she knows... and now she's showing aggression outside of the house, which was rare until a few days ago. I'm now hitting my breaking point.

The dog was a gift from my partner, who didn't know the intensity of the breed, in her defense I had always talked about wanting a heeler, and I was also oblivious to the 2-4 years of Velociraptor behaviour to be expected.

I've been taking on positive reinforcement training as a fundamental. But have been forced to redirect her pretty heavily recently. Have tried physically seperating her when people are around, (tried crate training but she really didn't appreciate it) with just baby gates, or occasionally closing her into her play pen. But she will bark with the power of a thousand suns until she can come and be by your side. She wants to protect us, and sometimes she is just looking for attention, or to play with us, usually as we are winding down for the evening.
It seems like no amount of exercise, puzzle toys, lick mats, agility, socialisation will stop the random bursts of barking and biting.

The barking is wearing down on my neighbours and my friend and newborn downstairs. They used to pop in for coffee or just a chat, but it's now causing a bit of an awkward rift between us. They have met hundreds of times, Isha is given treats when they come up and given plenty of attention. But to be fair, these guys aren't dog people. And she can recognise that and tries to test their boundaries when they come up to say hi. The other day, the father downstairs went down to say hi to her when she was laying in the backyard. And out of nowhere she growled and jumped to bite him on the hand. Hard. 

He lost it, came up screaming at me he doesn't want a biting dog around his kid. Between those few incidents, and the barking seeming to get worse. I'm really struggling to see a way out of this.

I've been becoming progressively more isolated as the months to by and she tends to be less and less predictable. Every day is a new challenge. And my mental health is honestly really starting to take a turn for the worse.

If I'm honest with myself, I don't think she is the right dog for our situation, I love her to pieces, but I couldn't give any more time than I have been. 
She would be an absolutely outstanding cattle dog, 
But for the minute atleast, we are studying and working in a suburban environment, can't afford not to be sharing accommodation, and I can only give her so much time of the day. we are looking to train her into a dog that can atleast tolerate being in social environments, and we can't risk the biting and anti-social behaviour for another 24 months+

We can either muzzle her, find a solution to the barking/ jumping etc, and seriously limit her interactions with other people for the next bit, or we can accept that we jumped into this with ignorance, and accept she'll have a better life out there with the livestock, or atleast an experienced dog trainer.

I've had border collies and Kelpies as a kid, but have to accept my own shortcomings here, Im scrambling to keep up with her, but I've been in tears most days for weeks now. Starting to feel helpless. I know there's plenty I haven't tried. I just don't know if I'm going to be able to curb the behaviour quick enough to avoid something bad happening to one of my friends/family.",3,1742022242.0,AustralianCattleDog,1,1.0,False

Hi guys.
Im a flight attendant for a big company. I had a flight and my position was that of FA serving the cockpit.

First officer from that flight and I flew 4-5 times already together and already once last month had a layover together. So we kinda knew each other at this point.

Company’s policy is when one pilot goes to use lavatory, someone else from crew must be in the cockpit with the other one.

FO asked coffee from me before Captain went into lav. As I was going to enter the cockpit, cap went out and naturally I knew I should stay in the cockpit until he returns.

I handled the coffe to the first officer, and I sat on the jumpseat behind him. He held coffee for like 10s and then said “Can I ask you for something?” I said ofcourse.
He gave me back the coffee and said “Spit in it please”.

???

I was stunned for a moment and said that I cannot, does he want to report me? (That would make me lose my job if they established that theres my saliva in the coffee). I asked why??
He said “I want to see something, I promise I wont report you” and he put coffee cup under my face and I dont know why, I was shocked and also intrigued why tf would he want me to spit in it. What will he see?
So I did what he asked of me. All happened so quick.

Then immediately I asked “why did you want me to spit-“ mid sentence guy chugged entire cup of coffee with my spit in it.

My jaw dropped, I didnt say a word. Captain entered, fo gave me back the cup and winked at me and thanked me for delicious coffee.

Idk why I just felt so overcome with sadness and I think I was also just feeling a lot because I had a lot of anxiety and whatnot so it was just a lot at once? And so I was looking out the window thinking don’tcrydon’tcrydon’tcry. Then I went and looked at some shops and found a cushion I like a lot so might get and then had a coffee while I waited for my appointment. 

My hair appointment went well. I think yes I’m unbelievably unhappy with myself and how I look, but *objectively* I have okay hair. I have zero greys which I should be more grateful for because for example M has a tonne she dyes and a lot of women in their thirties actually have them. I have the same colour as mums hair and she’s 70 this year never dyed her hair and is only starting to get small wisps of grey scattered through this past year, she’s very much still a full brunette. Anyway so no greys - yay. I have quite healthy hair, she kept commenting on it which made me feel nice. She even told me to get a different treatment as the one I booked in for wouldn’t do anything with my current health sooo yay. I get annoyed that my hair won’t hold a curl or wave or big blow out but also I have naturally straight and silky hair. It’s very fine so it’s soft but a lot of it so even when I have a hair shedding phase you can’t really tell which is really lucky. That makes it heavy though, like the fact I have a lot of it she said I have heavy straight hair which I’ve heard a lot before. But it’s tricky because I don’t want any weight taken out of it because then it looks too wispy at the ends, yknow. Idk. I’m just trying to be positive about my hair. I like the colour she did I think, I need to assess when I get home as I’m currently waiting for my bus but I think I like it. I asked for a rich deep chocolate and I think I got exactly that. The cut though… is my hair just prone to being cut badly?! Why do I go in with long hair and come out with a little lord farquaad? Yes it’s still long okay but it FEELS short. I think becUse I get it cut softly blunt at the ends it makes it feel shorter. Idk. But I don’t really go anywhere and when I do it’s errand/appointments, to my parents, for a walk, to the office and stuff like that. So does it matter? No. Plus I tend to wear it up a lot nowadays like in a claw clip because I find the feeling of it on my face SO aggravating. I’ll wear it down when I go out and about but at home it’s always clipped back. But clipped not tied because *hair health*. Anyway it was nice to get reassurance my hair is doing well given I’m on a bit of a hair health journey at the moment. Or rather trying to be better with it because I’ve never lacked in giving it attention. But also trying to work out what’s good for MY hair not what products sound fun or look pretty in my shower or has a cult following because what good are they if they don’t work for me, yknow. Anyway she showed me it in the back mirror and moved it around and it looked like a MIRROR it was so shiny! Yay! 

I got the bus home and it was fine :) better than the first one for sure. 

I feel so anxy today. I don’t feel great. 

I just realised I’ve not eaten today. I had a coffee though, before my appointments and then I had two green teas while at my appointment. I just had a little bowl of yoghurt and idk what to make for dinner. I’m craving pizza so f’ing badly. 

Okay f it I’m getting pizza. I have the calories for it. It’s fine. I mean it’s not FINE it’s me being a fat fucking pig but whatever. Today I opt to not care.

So yesterday she phoned and said she's dying, I told her I'm at my son's school, I will phone an Ambulance. 
Someone phoned me, a manager at work we both know. She said this has been going on for years, but no body picks up her calls anymore and I'm just the next person. Her parents aren't horrible to her, they are just not coping with her drinking and her boyfriend that she doesn't ""want"" to live with actually got a restraining order against her and his scared of her for things she has accused him of. Her kids doesn't live with her for a good reason, and she's telling me this because my friend is losing her job and they are opening a case against her, but the last time they spoke to her she is accusing and bringing other people into the story that are innocent but they are going to have to stand in court to defend themselves anyway. She suggested I cut all contact as this is an issue that all of them have tried to help her with. And it's not only alcohol, meaning she is using things that makes her dangerous at times, reason why she doesn't live with boyfriend anymore as well. 
I.... Was ... Shocked!!! It felt like I really knew her so well. But I don't know her at all!! 
On the one side I really want to help her, but with all the info, it makes sense that I'm only the next best contact if she drank to much or took pills. She did start accusing me and she doesn't phone at all except in a certain situation. Where previously she would phone and check in. I feel very groomed 😅
I don't even know what to say to her....

Asked the owner—out they just opened a month ago! Free WiFi, free sockets. Spells heaven! Downside it’s just far from Makati CBD. I ride a jeep via Buendia if im going back to CBD.

There's a feeling I've known since childhood, a peculiar flicker in the frame of my reality. It's déjà vu, that sudden, undeniable sense of having lived through a moment before, even when logic screams otherwise. It's not just a passing thought; it's a visceral, almost tangible feeling, like a half-remembered dream surfacing in the middle of a waking day. 

These experiences have always left me unsettled, prompting questions that gnaw at the edges of my understanding. Is it just my brain playing tricks, a glitch in the system? Or is it something more, a hint of a deeper truth, a glimpse behind the curtain? This essay is my personal exploration of that unsettling feeling, a journey through the labyrinth of déjà vu, simulation theory, and the elusive nature of reality itself.

I remember one instance vividly: a quiet afternoon in a bookstore, the scent of old paper and coffee filling the air. I was browsing a shelf, and suddenly, it hit me – a wave of overwhelming familiarity. The arrangement of the books, the way the sunlight slanted through the window, even the faint hum of conversation – it was all perfectly, unnervingly familiar. It wasn’t just a feeling of recognition; it was a sense of knowing what would happen next, a premonition that dissolved as quickly as it arrived.

These moments aren't always so clear. Sometimes, it's just a fleeting sense of recognition, a whisper of a memory that fades before I can grasp it. Other times, it's more intense, a disorienting sensation that leaves me questioning my perception of time and place. I’ve tried to rationalize it, to find a logical explanation, but the feeling persists, a constant reminder that reality might be more fluid than I thought.

Naturally, my mind drifted towards the more outlandish theories. What if, like in ""The Matrix,"" our reality is a simulation? What if déjà vu is a glitch, a momentary lapse in the code? It's a tempting idea, especially when the feeling is so profound. It’s comforting, in a strange way, to think that there might be a reason for these unsettling experiences, a logical explanation within an illogical framework.

I've spent countless hours pondering the implications. If we are in a simulation, then what are the rules? Who are the programmers? And what is the purpose of this elaborate illusion? The thought of a reality that can be altered or manipulated is both exhilarating and terrifying. 

It makes me wonder if there's a ""real"" world beyond this one, a world where the rules are different, where déjà vu doesn't exist. Of course, the rational side of me argues against it. 

Occam's Razor whispers that the simplest explanation is usually the best. But the experiences I’ve had, those moments of intense familiarity, leave a lingering doubt. What if the simplest explanation is just a clever distraction, a way to keep us from questioning the true nature of our existence?

My search for answers led me to the strange and wonderful world of quantum physics. The observer effect, entanglement, the probabilistic nature of reality – it all seemed to mirror the unsettling feeling of déjà vu. The idea that consciousness might play a role in shaping reality, that observation can influence outcomes, resonated with my own experiences.

Could déjà vu be a glimpse into the quantum realm, a momentary overlap of parallel realities? Could it be a sign that our consciousness is entangled with something larger, something beyond our comprehension? These are questions that I can't answer, but they fuel my curiosity, pushing me to explore the boundaries of what I think I know.

I’ve begun to wonder if my subjective experience of déjà vu relates to the idea of information being fundamental to reality. Perhaps my brain is momentarily accessing information from a parallel reality, creating the sensation of pre-experience. Or maybe, just maybe, it’s a sign that the very fabric of reality is more fluid and interconnected than we perceive.

My personal journey with déjà vu has also led me to explore the intersection of science and spirituality. My faith teaches me that there are mysteries beyond human understanding, that there are forces at work that we cannot fully comprehend. And in those moments of déjà vu, I feel a connection to something larger, something beyond the mundane.

I’ve also found that visualization, the act of “seeing” something as already done, relates to my faith and the experiences of deja vu. If I can visualize a desired outcome, I begin to feel that it is already real, and that relates to the feelings of deja vu. It feels like I'm accessing a memory of a future already realized.

But I also understand the importance of balance. I know that faith and science are not mutually exclusive, that they can coexist, each offering its own perspective on the nature of reality. My experiences with déjà vu have taught me to embrace the unknown, to question my assumptions, and to remain open to the infinite possibilities that lie beyond the boundaries of my understanding.

Déjà vu, for me, is more than just a fleeting sensation. It's a constant reminder that reality is a mystery, a puzzle that I may never fully solve. It's a feeling that has shaped my perspective, pushing me to explore the depths of consciousness and the vastness of the universe.

Whether it's a neurological quirk, a glitch in a simulation, or a glimpse into the quantum realm, déjà vu has become a part of my personal journey, a constant companion in my search for meaning. And as I continue to explore the mysteries of existence, I know that the flicker in the frame will always be there, a reminder that the truth is often stranger than fiction.

( 25 f ) here.  I'm sorry in advance this will be a long one.  AITA for wanting my fiance to not talk with other women unless necessary. 

My fiance (30 m) Dan and I keep having the same argument but in different situations. When we met he let me know that he had some friends that are girls, at the time I did not care because he rarely talked to them and wasn't very close to any. I ended up meeting the group and liked everyone so occasionally we would all go out together to bars, dinners and such.

I started to notice one particular girl in the group flirting with him. We will call her Bethany.  Bethany would openly flirt with Dan,  pulling him away from the group and even calling him randomly to talk about her ""boy problems"". I will admit I let it slide for about 3 months hoping nothing was there. One night we went out and Dan and Bethany were so into each other that Dan barely spoke to me the whole night. Looking over the menu with her, waited in Line next to her and even left me in a dark parking lot when she called saying she was pulling in to park. 

I brought it up to him I was uncomfortable and jealous. I didn't like how close they were and I was starting to dislike Bethany. After a lot of back and forth, we decided that,  if Bethany needed anything she would need to message me, no more calls to vent about her relationship/dating problems and no more private messages between the two. This went on for all of one week before I saw him sending her a Snapchat.  I asked why he had broken our agreement and I got the ""We've known each other forever ""(3 years ) and ""She's my best friend ""  After a lot of arguments and even having a few of the other friends get involved,  I finally gave up and told him to block her and to not talk to her again. If we saw Bethany at parties/dinners we acted friendly and civil. Eventually, she messaged me saying she was giving up on a friendship and would leave us alone.  

Almost 2 years later we are engaged and planning our wedding for December 2025. 

Since then I have started therapy and medication to stabilize my moods and now have someone teaching me how to voice my feelings before I let situations get out of hand., which I try to practice lot a lot. 

I have sat down with Dan and let him that I am very uncomfortable with him entertaining other women while playing video games with them. We have had a few fights here and there about it but for the most part, we have been understanding with each other, until 2 months ago.  He started playing with a group every day. One of them being a woman. I expressed that I know it's a ""me problem"" but I'm jealous of how he laughs and talks to her for hours on the game. She was on the mic heard the one-way conversation and laughed at me. Then they both proceeded to talk to each other about how crazy I was to be jealous of someone online while I stood next to him waiting for a response...
When he got off the game I told him to please not play with that group if she is on. That he can play with the boys.  I checked he played with her less than a week ago. 

Now this last week Dan and I got into another argument over another woman. Dan likes to get coffee in the morning before he heads to work, and for the last 4 months or so he has been only going to one gas station. He has mentioned a few times a woman who works mornings giving him free coffee and making jokes with him even giving him a sticker because it reminded her of him.  I wouldn't have known any of this but Dan has told me, I would kinda laugh and shake it off each time.

 Well last week, I got him a temporary ring to wear until our wedding, soon after we got the Stomach Flu.  First me then Dan.  On Friday morning Dan decided to go get coffee, I reminded him the doctor wanted us on a clear liquid diet and nothing harsh on our stomachs so coffee probably wasn't the best idea. He went anyway.  Later that night I noticed he didn't have his ring on.  I joked and took mine off saying 'I guess we're single tonight' he then jumped to how it was a ""test"" to see how long it would take for me to realize it's gone. I told him, okay well put it back on I noticed.. Dan then replied, ""I will in a second it's out in the truck...."" 

I'm not going to lie I wanted to cry when he said that. He came in and went straight to playing video games.  After a while to calm down and collect my thoughts, I went to him and told him how I felt. I let him know that I am jealous and I know it's not a good thing to be but the fact he took his ring off in the truck when getting coffee upset me. I explained I would make coffee from now on in the morning before he went to work and asked him what flavor /blends he wanted. He got defensive and started to call me ""delusional"" for even inclining that he may be going for another woman and that he WILL be going back the next day no matter what.  After about 10 minutes of back and forth, I gave up and told him I would like to discuss it again with him once he got off the game and calmed down a bit.  We brought it back up the next morning when he went back but it was the same ""I'm smarter than to forget my ring, and I go there because I like the coffee"".  

We have been arguing about this all week. 

Tonight I had a breakdown, I woke up from a nap and he was playing with a new woman on the game and as soon as I sat next to him he turned the chat volume down. I asked why he did that and he responded they guys were being too loud. I told him I knew there was a girl in the chat and if he could just play with another team. He freaks out on me. Yelling about how I have issues, how I'm evil, and never want him to just have fun. I started to cry when he said that I was evil.  Now I'm here typing this up while he sleeps like nothing happened.   

Am I the issue?  Am I being too jealous and controlling? I feel like it but at the same this it kills me inside to see him put these women before my feelings.  I get he has to talk to women every day in public, work, and such. I'm just concerned about the ones he's talking to every day for fun.  I know jealousy and trust issues are ugly things to have. I want to bring it to my therapist but I feel silly after all these times I go in talking about how amazing he is and how much I love him.   Which I still believe 100%.   I just need an outsider's view at this point. 


TL;DR: my fiance 30M has a history of talking and gaming with women but has never cheated, took his ring off while out and forgot to put it back on. I F25 want him to not talk to other women unless necessary because of jealousy and suspicions. ",0,1742019798.0,TwoHotTakes,77,0.28,False

I’d like to expand my circle of friends, who rides motorcycles.

I enjoy going on Sunday rides in Brandenburg, exploring the countryside and stopping for coffee or lunch. We try to stay off the autobahn as much as we can and go at a pace that works for everyone.
The starting point in Berlin, is decided so that it works for everyone, and is relevant to where we want to go for the day.

1jbov8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/quantum/comments/1jbov8s/the_flicker_in_the_frame_my_encounters_with_déjà/,The Flicker in the Frame: My Encounters with Déjà Vu and the Search for Reality,"There's a feeling I've known since childhood, a peculiar flicker in the frame of my reality. It's déjà vu, that sudden, undeniable sense of having lived through a moment before, even when logic screams otherwise. It's not just a passing thought; it's a visceral, almost tangible feeling, like a half-remembered dream surfacing in the middle of a waking day. 

These experiences have always left me unsettled, prompting questions that gnaw at the edges of my understanding. Is it just my brain playing tricks, a glitch in the system? Or is it something more, a hint of a deeper truth, a glimpse behind the curtain? This essay is my personal exploration of that unsettling feeling, a journey through the labyrinth of déjà vu, simulation theory, and the elusive nature of reality itself.

I remember one instance vividly: a quiet afternoon in a bookstore, the scent of old paper and coffee filling the air. I was browsing a shelf, and suddenly, it hit me – a wave of overwhelming familiarity. The arrangement of the books, the way the sunlight slanted through the window, even the faint hum of conversation – it was all perfectly, unnervingly familiar. It wasn’t just a feeling of recognition; it was a sense of knowing what would happen next, a premonition that dissolved as quickly as it arrived.

These moments aren't always so clear. Sometimes, it's just a fleeting sense of recognition, a whisper of a memory that fades before I can grasp it. Other times, it's more intense, a disorienting sensation that leaves me questioning my perception of time and place. I’ve tried to rationalize it, to find a logical explanation, but the feeling persists, a constant reminder that reality might be more fluid than I thought.

Naturally, my mind drifted towards the more outlandish theories. What if, like in ""The Matrix,"" our reality is a simulation? What if déjà vu is a glitch, a momentary lapse in the code? It's a tempting idea, especially when the feeling is so profound. It’s comforting, in a strange way, to think that there might be a reason for these unsettling experiences, a logical explanation within an illogical framework.

I've spent countless hours pondering the implications. If we are in a simulation, then what are the rules? Who are the programmers? And what is the purpose of this elaborate illusion? The thought of a reality that can be altered or manipulated is both exhilarating and terrifying. 

It makes me wonder if there's a ""real"" world beyond this one, a world where the rules are different, where déjà vu doesn't exist. Of course, the rational side of me argues against it. 

Occam's Razor whispers that the simplest explanation is usually the best. But the experiences I’ve had, those moments of intense familiarity, leave a lingering doubt. What if the simplest explanation is just a clever distraction, a way to keep us from questioning the true nature of our existence?

My search for answers led me to the strange and wonderful world of quantum physics. The observer effect, entanglement, the probabilistic nature of reality – it all seemed to mirror the unsettling feeling of déjà vu. The idea that consciousness might play a role in shaping reality, that observation can influence outcomes, resonated with my own experiences.

Could déjà vu be a glimpse into the quantum realm, a momentary overlap of parallel realities? Could it be a sign that our consciousness is entangled with something larger, something beyond our comprehension? These are questions that I can't answer, but they fuel my curiosity, pushing me to explore the boundaries of what I think I know.

I’ve begun to wonder if my subjective experience of déjà vu relates to the idea of information being fundamental to reality. Perhaps my brain is momentarily accessing information from a parallel reality, creating the sensation of pre-experience. Or maybe, just maybe, it’s a sign that the very fabric of reality is more fluid and interconnected than we perceive.

My personal journey with déjà vu has also led me to explore the intersection of science and spirituality. My faith teaches me that there are mysteries beyond human understanding, that there are forces at work that we cannot fully comprehend. And in those moments of déjà vu, I feel a connection to something larger, something beyond the mundane.

I’ve also found that visualization, the act of “seeing” something as already done, relates to my faith and the experiences of deja vu. If I can visualize a desired outcome, I begin to feel that it is already real, and that relates to the feelings of deja vu. It feels like I'm accessing a memory of a future already realized.

But I also understand the importance of balance. I know that faith and science are not mutually exclusive, that they can coexist, each offering its own perspective on the nature of reality. My experiences with déjà vu have taught me to embrace the unknown, to question my assumptions, and to remain open to the infinite possibilities that lie beyond the boundaries of my understanding.

Déjà vu, for me, is more than just a fleeting sensation. It's a constant reminder that reality is a mystery, a puzzle that I may never fully solve. It's a feeling that has shaped my perspective, pushing me to explore the depths of consciousness and the vastness of the universe.

Whether it's a neurological quirk, a glitch in a simulation, or a glimpse into the quantum realm, déjà vu has become a part of my personal journey, a constant companion in my search for meaning. And as I continue to explore the mysteries of existence, I know that the flicker in the frame will always be there, a reminder that the truth is often stranger than fiction.

In the last two weeks, I started taking L-tyrosine (500 mg) on an empty stomach, and I think it might be related. However, I’ve also found on the internet that creatine can cause sleep issues. Additionally, I take a multivitamin for weightlifting and L-carnitine, so it’s possible that something is mixing together and causing the hypnic jerks and bad dreams.

1jbot9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1jbot9k/a1c_from_97_to_56_with_very_little_meds/,A1C from 9.7 to 5.6 with very little meds.,"Male 42, So fairly long story. Was diagnosed December 26th with a a1c of 9.7. I like most of us was pretty surprised and distraught. Had been in the pre diabetic range 2 years before and assumed it would probably be around the same this time. No such luck. I always knew I could be eating better but when you think you’re doing “decent” it’s kind of hard. Anyways doc said based on my size(5’7 203lbs) that I wasn’t super overweight and she wasn’t optimistic that diet change would be enough. Probably more genetic factors. So was prescribed metformin at 2 500mg tabs a day as well as a tenovi blood monitor that transmits my numbers right to my doc. 

      Now I did not want to take the medicine and was determined I could do it on my own. So I made my mind up that day to try to cut all sugar and carbs cold turkey. And I would see what my numbers were when I got my monitor in about two weeks. So determined, but lost as heck on what to eat I spent most of that first week eating green chile and lean hamburger meat and slowly started adding a little beans(my main carb vice I found) and salads, nuts etc. As well as nothing but water and unsweetened black tea. Along with this I started lifting weights more and I started walking and worked up to jogging and running. 

       After two weeks with feeling like I was kicking this thing in the butt I got my monitor. First test was like 260. Here’s the kicker though. This was the first time I ever did a finger prick and the monitor errored then gave me the reading. Either way I was distraught. Decided that evening to take medicine. However based on horror stories I’d heard from friends of stomach issues I decided to cut the regular 500 metformin in half and plan was to take half a pill a day for a few days then move up. The thing is when I woke up the next morning and checked my blood sugar it was in the low 90’s. I thought how does my blood sugar drop from 260 to low 90’s overnight with half a pill? Either way I decided to just roll with the half a pill for a few days. 

    After about a week or so of taking half a pill a day I started to get down into the 70’s and was getting light headed. So I decided to cut back to a quarter pill a day. At this point it had been about a month and I had lost about 20 pounds. Down to about 180. Running more and overall feeling pretty good. 

     So the quarter pill a day went on for about a week or two and even though my blood sugar went up a little it was still really good. In the 80’s and 90’s. So I decided to talk to my doctor and she was super happy and told me just to stop taking it all together and see what happens. 

      My blood sugar now runs high 80’s, 90’s and sometimes over 100 in the mornings first thing but  the highest I have ever been on a test is 117. I feel pretty good. Today was my three month a1c check(even though I’m a little shy of 3 months). And I was informed I am at 5.6. As well as being down 32 lbs. I’ll take it! 

      So a little of what I’ve learned. This is just from my experience so take it as that but it’s seemed to work pretty good for me so far. 

 Diet Wise: LOTS of lean meats and salads. Salads range from garden salad by itself, to my norm of garden salad with diced chicken breast or hamburger meat and diced boiled egg, bacon bits, avocado etc. All the good stuff lol Low sodium mixed nuts as my main little snack. I’ve thrown in a few Atkins snacks but they are a little expensive. I’ll eat vegetables with my chicken or beef. Maybe I have had a few slices of wheat bread here and there but for the most part all breads, tortillas, chips etc are all no gos for me. Same with drinks I have had one or two coke zeros and I’ll drink the ICE brand drinks once in a while but mostly water, coffee and unsweetened tea. 

Exercise: The number one way I lower my blood sugar is walking/jogging/running. Absolutely a game changer. I notice that the days I don’t run or walk(I try to do at least a mile a day) 
I am always higher than when I do. Always. It is absolutely one of the best ways to lower your blood sugar, and I noticed even with the little amount of metformin I was taking it will drop drastically with a good walk or light run. 

     Anyhoo, I’m no doctor nor expert at this by far but I am excited about my progress and wanted to share. Reading other people experiences on here has helped me and I’m glad to be a part of this community. It’s nice knowing you’re not the only one who struggles or doesn’t know what to do. Very thankful for you all. Sorry for the long post and horrible structure of this post lol. Thank you all and Godspeed.
