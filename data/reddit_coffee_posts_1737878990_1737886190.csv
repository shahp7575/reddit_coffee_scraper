* Ability to create multiple ‚Äòsavers‚Äô accounts to visualise your money better, and a respectable interest rate on up to five of these (calculated daily and distributed monthly)

At the moment there‚Äôs a promo if you sign up using an existing customer‚Äôs referral link -¬†**we both get $20!**¬†For practically no work at all! That‚Äôs a free small meal (or cheeky beer) right there.

Our first time was way back when we met each other for the first time and I told him I like how intimate this place is. Their menu is also great and I told him which drink I like best so I ordered one and he ordered a different drink. This was 2 years ago. 


Yesterday, we thought we‚Äôd meet up at this place again. He asked to share my location and I did cuz I was still on the way and he always comes early at least 15-30 mins ahead pag nag meet kami outside. I got there not too long and I quickly spotted him in the crowd of people. He sat in the corner with legs crossed, I was 5 meters away and I can already smell his scent. Every time he sees me, he always flashes a smile of comfort. He stood up and kissed my neck and goddamn he smells amazing. Then my gaze went to the table, I saw my favorite iced strawberry drink with honey then I asked how he knew I was gonna get that drink. He said it‚Äôs because I like it best. I couldn‚Äôt recall telling him maybe I did but we haven‚Äôt been to this place for so long.



I sat down and he showed me the notes on his phone. It‚Äôs the list of ‚Äúwhat my girl likes, what she doesn‚Äôt like, things she wants to do, vacation plans, shopping items she can‚Äôt miss, etc‚Äù It‚Äôs a loooonggg list and I never knew how picky I was until I saw that list. Our first time meeting slowly came back to me. How everything felt great and ecstatic and still does. We laughed at how silly he keeps track of the things about me and I dropped the tissue, I picked it up and then I saw his hand covering the corner of the table to cover my head from getting bumped. 


My bf is far from perfect but the little things like this makes me fall for him everyday and everyday is a choice to love him even harder.

My doctor actually suggested that since I drink so much water that I eat saltier foods to bind to the oxalate to try to pass the smaller crystals more. But in my family high cholesterol and diabetes is genetic and I'm honestly not a huge salt eater. I drink lemon water daily and have at MOST two to three milk teas a week (I drink nothing else besides lemon water.) I can't really completely give up boba tea, I know black teas are the worst for you but I feel if I drink just one or two a week it should be okay. 

It concerns me a lot of the foods in the low or no oxalate are mostly unhealthy (at least what I eat), what you see underlined is  what I eat a lot of or used to before I started controlling my diet more. Hopefully this list can help others as well. I know I have an older list in my car somewhere I can dig out but it will take time to find it.

All of my coffee gear burned, so I now have to start over.   
  
I need your help to find the right hand grinder!  
  
I will mainly use it for pour over, but I will also like it to be used on travels with an AeroPress.   
  
So I would like a grinder that:  
\-Is consistent in grind coarseness¬†  
\-Has grind settings suitable for both pour over and AeroPress  
\-Fits inside the plunger of an AeroPress   
\-Can grind at least 18 grams of coffee and ideally more than that

What grinder would you recommend?

1iaabqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/1iaabqv/the_hardest_but_most_effective_treatment_for_this/,The hardest but most effective treatment for this is exposure therapy,"It sucks. It sucks it sucks it sucks it sucks it sucks It sucks it sucks it sucks it sucks it sucks so bad. It sucks so so much it sucks so bad it‚Äôs the worst thing ever but it‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs ever actually given me any actual considerable progress. And I‚Äôve tried medications, I‚Äôve tried tons of different therapies, surgeries, everything. 

The only thing that‚Äôs done it for me is just forcing myself to be recorded and photographed all the time. It is literally heck on earth but miraculously videos and pictures don‚Äôt hurt like they used to. I used to not be able go into public without taking my mask off (otherwise I‚Äôd have a full panic attack) and a single bad picture of me would ruin my entire month and send me into a 2 week isolation and su*cidal depression. A year after that, trying to record videos of myself was signing myself up for a week of misery. 

I‚Äôm a musician so these things are sort of necessary unfortunately. 

Today I went out with a friend and, on my own request & dime, recorded a camcorder video of me singing and playing one of my songs with b-roll clips of me walking around or staring directly into the camera. And I edited the thing myself on a full laptop screen, watched all the clips back. Some of them were gut wrenching‚Äî I‚Äôm SO ugly! Others I didn‚Äôt mind so much. And I‚Äôm able to watch the video just fine. I‚Äôm able to see pictures people take of me with their phone cameras from awful angles and not freak out so much anymore. 

It‚Äôs like, every time I got exposed to it, the pain decreased a little bit. Just a bit. It was a little less intense and lasted a little less long. 

The first big step I took (and probably a decent example of how to do this) was recording a video of myself singing and playing a song cover on my phone just in my apartment. And I watched it back, felt the pain, and decided to say screw it and posted it to my instagram page. And while I desperately wanted to search up surgeries and fixes and research for hours how ugly I am into ChatGPT or something (all of which I ended up doing and more) I told myself I needed to delay that response. That compulsion. Not deny it completely, just delay it. So I sat and meditated on my bed for 20 excruciating minutes. That was revelatory. Then I forced myself out of the house and went to the gym, then a coffee shop to do homework. I let myself, after 6 hours, check my instagram and perform some compulsions. And I realized it was ok. Nobody called me ugly in the comments, nobody unfollowed me. I just got a bunch of likes and really supportive comments about how beautiful it was. People now I meet tell me they saw the video and thought it was amazing. People I‚Äôm starting to talk to and date watch it and don‚Äôt make a comment on my appearance at all. 

Now I totally went down a rabbit hole for the next two days and even called an old surgeon to make a consultation appointment for a chin implant and freaked out, but that wave of emotion passed quicker that time. So I kept doing it. I saw more pictures of me friends took and looked at them. I took more videos of myself. I exposed myself to the worst angles in the worst lighting possible and felt all the pain I could. Almost masochistic. It made me feel intensely suicidal at times. But every single time the pain was just a little bit less. And it would last a little less long. And I just kept doing that until now, where the pain only lasts maybe 10 minutes before I move on and stop caring‚Ä¶ because it‚Äôs not new. And I realize actually how I look more. It‚Äôs not as good as I tend to picture in my head or see in good mirror lighting posing, but it‚Äôs not as bad as the worst angles might make me think. 

And I realize how being drop-dead gorgeous isn‚Äôt the end of the world, I can still be appreciated, loved, revered, found pleasing to look at without needing to be facially perfect. I can still accomplish everything I want to. I realize I don‚Äôt put the pressure of perfect physical attractiveness on anyone else like I do myself‚Äî my absolute idols and influences all kind of look weird and human and.. not like supermodels, to say the least. 

Idk. It was so hard to do and I don‚Äôt think I was ready to try this until this year because, like many of you, I don‚Äôt really want to heal from this nor experience the actual exposure part. I don‚Äôt want to know how I look, I don‚Äôt want to see those angles. I‚Äôd rather block my mirrors off and never allow a picture of me taken again, and wear a mask everywhere. But I have to. I just have to. And it sucks and it‚Äôs easily the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done but it works, and it‚Äôs there for you to try if you ever so choose to. Because I think it‚Äôs massively changed my life and lifted a huge weight off my shoulders and ironically made me so much more confident. I can look at videos of myself now and‚Ä¶ like them? The same first video I took of myself singing I actually watch back kinda frequently and it doesn‚Äôt make me feel as crazy or terrible anymore. That‚Äôs insane progress from where I used to be. 

Just‚Ä¶ if you choose to do this, please be careful. Do it in a safe environment where you know you won‚Äôt hurt yourself or do something dangerous. ",2,1737884204.0,BodyDysmorphia,1,1.0,False

For those that get it on a temporary basis I wanted to know what are your symptoms and what are your coping mechanisms?

To give a bit of background:

- I‚Äôve had FD 3 times in 3 years
- Each time was after having a vomiting or diarrhoea bug, and def had covid a bit before the first
- Symptoms have varied each time with some constants. First time I had stomach burning (outside of stomach), belching and lost weight very quickly / second time burning and weight loss, and constant nausea / 3rd time (now) weight loss and burning, and acid reflux - mainly throat burning/silent reflux
- The 2nd, and this time, was prescribed PPI - 40mg 2 times per day for this one - but have noticed very little benefit from them and not convinced they help

And things I‚Äôve changed:
- given up coffee
- Almost no dairy
- Reduced alcohol (altho 2 times I had it where around Xmas where I drink more than usual)
- (Now) eating lots of veg and cutting out processed and sugary food
- No spicey food, very little fried food


Where I want to get to is to know what my playbook is when I get a stomach bug so it doesn‚Äôt result in months of my life grinding to a halt.  Would be great to hear from others that have had similar

I've been questioning for about a year now and I suspect that I might simply not understand the definition of asexuality correctly. I tend to take things too literally.

So I tick a lot of the ace boxes.

* When I read descriptions of sexual attraction I can never really relate to them. People seem to experience different things and at a very different intensity.
* When I get asked if I could go the rest of my life without sex, then the answer is ""I wouldn't be too happy about that but it would be fine"". *However*, that question is on the same level for me as ""could you go the rest of your life without coffee"". I like coffee but if you took it away from me, I'd find something else to enjoy.
* Last time I had sex was a very, very long time ago and I'm not really bothered by that. I usually got better things to do and often forget about the whole topic for months or more and then only think about it briefly without taking action.
* When I did have sex, it felt nice but also very ""mechanical"" and ""controlled"". Nothing happened instinctively. It was a lot like m>!asturbation!< but, honestly, worse, due to all the extra steps.

Buuuut. I do like some genders and body features. This goes beyond aesthetic attraction I think because my thoughts do wander into ""sexual"" territory. Now here's the thing, what I'm feeling is not about this particular person at all. It could be any person. It's more like seeing them ""gets my mind going"" and then I think ""intimacy would be nice"" and that person would be ""suitable"" (ugh, this sounds terrible). It's mostly a trigger for fantasies. I guess most people wouldn't call this ""sex"" either, it's more about being n>!aked!< and close and, how do I put it, ""experiencing/enjoying another body"" (üôà). I don't care about c>!limaxing!< myself, never have. I also never follow through on these fantasies, it's just too much work and exhausting and risky and mainly just in my head anyway. And self-care works 100%.

To me, it's ""sexual"" (I *think*, not really sure) and it only happens for some genders. I wouldn't call it *attraction*, especially not attraction to *that particular person*. Maybe ""simulus"" or ""impulse"".

So I'm especially tripping over the part in the ace definition that talks about attraction towards *specific* people. If that is important, then I'm ace. If not, that is if you find broad categories/groups of people ""sexually interesting"" but never care which one of them, then I'm not ace.

Like, is it ""I see *that* cup of coffee, now I want to drink *that and only that cup*"" or is it ""I smell coffee, now I'd like *some* coffee""?

I hope this wasn't too confusing. And many thanks in advance. üôè",0,1737883835.0,asexuality,0,0.5,False

Does the ""cup"" in the name mean shots of espresso? Meaning if I drank the entire contents of the 10 cup pot myself, I'd be drinking 10 shots of espresso?

My fiance is keen on having one of those donut towers instead of a classic large wedding cake for dessert, but we still want a small cake on top to cut (I love those retro heart shaped cakes with the frilly icing).

We're having about 130 people at the wedding but I imagine the small cake would serve maybe 20.

To those who have done this before, what did you do with the cake portion? Save it just for yourselves as the couple to eat? Serve it out to just the bridal party??

Our venue usually serves dessert and coffee on a buffet table where the cake is cut and served on plates but it sounds like anyone is free to go up and grab what they want rather than it being served individually to their table.

So for the logistics of the donut tower, I imagine the donuts would be served at the dessert buffet - should we request our cake to be served there too and just accept that not everyone will get a piece? Or ask that the whole cake be reserved and serve just the donuts?

However, I noticed that I am getting lesser and lesser patient and get angry easily and also sort of violent. Couple of mins ago, he escaped out from his bed while I was getting my rest after doing housework and all. I snapped and get super angry with him and get him to sit on his wheelchair (he has PD, so his walking gait not stable). 

I rocked his wheelchair and pushed the chair hard back to his bed and collided on the bed frame. I think his knee got hit by it too. I am very ashame of my action. Lucky my sis was there to snap the shit out of me. I got too angry and I walked out of the house and decided to go for a coffee. Although this was the 2rd or 3rd time he tried escape from his bed today. I found him butt naked early in the morning, sitting on the top of the rubbish bin this morning. Was damn furious too but I think the repeated act made me more frustrated.

I don't get angry easily but thesedays I'm super easy to get irritated. Even though I believe my mum is more sick of my dad from his constant taking off the diaper issue. I have to salute to her. She do get frustrated but usually I will be the calm mind. So I'm quite fortunate to have my sis and mum to rotate around the frustrated and calm one.

But my frustration is turning to be more violent. Which is scary and I'm not proud of. Is there anything I can do about it to remind myself to be calm or extend my trigger bar further or reset my hate for what is going on? Because I felt like I can't reset my hate and it kept constantly at the boiling point. I need to learn how to reset it.

Everyday is a loop for me although weekday is much better as he's in daycare and he will be asleep when I came home. But weekend is like rise and repeat for the past year. I tired to tie him down, works but he will escape and he don't like it. Which is same for me, I don't like to tie him as it's quite sad plus troublesome. So I haven't been tieing him for a few months but my patient is been constantly challanged. 

What is the point of having such people around when he is no longer himself. :( sometime I am worried about myself, whether am I what I think I am supposed to be, kind and patient. I am worried e.g. If I have kids of my own, would get impatient too? Sigh. ",2,1737882565.0,dementia,7,1.0,False

Creative Ways to Organize Kitchen Stuff and Maximize Space in Your Home
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maximizing kitchen space can feel like a daunting task, especially in smaller homes where every inch matters. However, there are numerous creative ways to organize your kitchen stuff that can help you gain both space and efficiency. By employing a few smart strategies, you can transform your kitchen into a well-organized area that not only looks great but functions beautifully.

### Utilize Vertical Space

One of the best tricks for maximizing space in your kitchen is to look up! Here are a few ideas to effectively use vertical space:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/kitchen-stuff-for-home  
  
- **Install shelving:** Floating shelves can store dishes, cookbooks, or decorative items without taking up valuable floor space.
- **Hang pots and pans:** A pot rack mounted on the wall or from the ceiling saves drawer space and adds an artistic touch.
- **Use magnetic strips:** Magnetic strips can hold knives or metal spice containers, freeing up countertop and drawer space.

### Declutter and Categorize

Keep your kitchen organized by decluttering regularly. Take the time to sort your kitchen items into categories:

- **Cookware:** Group pots, pans, and lids together, ensuring that they are easy to access.
- **Utensils:** Utilize drawer organizers to keep spatulas, spoons, and whisks separated.
- **Goods in use:** Keep items you use daily within easy reach, storing seasonal dishes out of the way.

### Creative Storage Solutions

Think outside the box when it comes to storage. Here are some innovative solutions that can work wonders for your kitchen stuff:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/kitchen-stuff-for-home  
  
- **Drawer dividers:** Custom drawer dividers can optimize space for utensils, tools, or even small appliances.
- **Clear containers:** Use clear bins or jars to store dry goods and snacks, allowing you to see what you have at a glance.
- **Tiered shelves:** Add tiered shelf organizers in your pantry or cabinets for better visibility and easier access.

### Maximize the Inside of Cabinets

Don‚Äôt forget about the inside of your cabinets. Making the most of these often-overlooked spaces can save you space:

- **Door storage:** Attach small shelves or hooks to cabinet doors for spices, kitchen gadgets, or measuring tools.
- **Lazy Susans:** These rotating trays are ideal for corner cabinets, allowing you to reach items with ease.
- **Stackable containers:** Opt for stackable bins to utilize vertical space within your cabinets effectively.

### Embrace Multi-functional Items

Choosing multi-functional kitchen tools can also help you save space. Consider the following options:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/kitchen-stuff-for-home  
  
- **Appliance combos:** Invest in appliances that combine functions, like a toaster oven that bakes.
- **Collapsible items:** Look for collapsible measuring cups or mixing bowls that tuck away neatly.
- **Magnetic measuring spoons:** These can stick together, preventing clutter and keeping your drawers tidy.

### Keep Counters Clear

Maintaining a clutter-free countertop is key to an organized kitchen. Here are some tips to help:

- **Limit small appliances:** Only keep out the appliances you use regularly, and store the rest away.
- **Create a coffee station:** Dedicate a corner for your coffee maker, cups, and supplies to centralize the area.
- **Add a central island:** If space allows, an island can serve as additional prep space while offering storage underneath.

Implementing these creative ways to organize your kitchen stuff can lead to a more functional and enjoyable cooking experience. With the tips outlined, you can turn your kitchen into an efficient workspace without losing style. Remember, the key to a tidy kitchen is not just organization, but also regular maintenance. A few minutes each week devoted to tidying up can preserve your kitchen‚Äôs order, making it a pleasant place to prepare meals.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/kitchen-stuff-for-home  
  
So roll up your sleeves and start transforming your kitchen today! It‚Äôs time to maximize your space and make cooking a joy rather than a chore.

### Conclusion

As you embark on your journey to create a functional and inviting kitchen, remember that the right kitchen stuff can make all the difference. Having essential tools at your fingertips transforms cooking from a chore into a delightful experience. From high-quality knives and versatile pots to handy gadgets, these must-have items empower you to explore your culinary passions, whether you're whipping up a quick weeknight dinner or hosting a dinner party.

Equally important is the organization of your kitchen stuff. A well-arranged kitchen not only saves you time but also enhances your creativity in the kitchen. Consider using clear containers for dry goods, implementing drawer dividers for utensils, and utilizing vertical space with hanging racks or shelves. These creative organization methods allow you to make the most out of every inch, ensuring that everything has a dedicated spot and is easily accessible.

1ia9sah,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ia9sah/my_mum_is_mad_at_our_house_sitter_my_sisters/,My mum is mad at our house sitter (my sister's boyfriend) and I'm worried it might get messy,"16 female, but I am slightly irrelevant to this story. I didn't really know where to post this, but this could become a  major family issue so I'll post it here. So my family, my mum (52), dad (52)  and sister (18, slightly more than a week away from 19) went on a three week holiday around Europe. We built the house mostly independently a few years ago, as well as doing a lot of the landscaping ourselves. My mum was really stressed out about finding someone to look after the house, and it took us months before my sister's boyfriend, let's call him Jack, stepped up and volunteered. He always wants to help in whatever way he can, so much so that he continuously asks to do jobs around the house whenever he's here. My sister, let's call her Sara, and Jack have been dating for almost 3 years now, so he's pretty much become part of the family. Mum was really happy to find someone that she trusted to look after the house, and so we left on the holiday with little worries, making sure to pay him, as well as giving him extra for petrol, food, and other necessities. The day we got back, a few days ago now, he met us at the airport to bring us home, hung out with us for a few hours then left. Nothing out of the ordinary. The only different thing I saw was when I was grabbing a towel for my shower, and I saw that the towel cupboard was empty, and all the towels, both bath and beach towels, were on the laundry bench. Since Jack had had people over, I thought they were just the towels they had used, and thought nothing of it. The next day, I woke up very late, around 12:30 (jet lag), and Sara had already left, to hang out with Jack and some of their mutual friends. My mum was short with me as soon as I woke up, and I assumed she was tired and irritated because she had been unpacking all morning, so to help I went to mow the lawn (for context I asked Jack not to do this because it is one of my favourite chores and wanted to do it when I got back). It was a hot day, so when I finished mowing, my mum, my dad and me went for a swim in our pool. Next to the pool there is a garden bed which my mum had planted shortly before we left and was very proud of it. Our dog, a border collie, gets kind of insane whenever anyone goes in the pool, and runs around the fence perimeter and barks whenever we go under or swim around. When I got out of the pool and was about to go inside for a shower, my mum stopped me and apologised for being short with me all day. I did the same because I am easily roused and got a bit annoyed too. She then proceeded to tell me that the reason that she was upset was not because of tiredness or anything, but because of the way the house had been left. For context, my mum is a very hardworking woman who is very proud of anything she accomplishes, as she should be. She is amazing, but can become upset whenever things become askew. I was confused, as I hadn't seen anything out of the ordinary, but she showed me how the newly planted garden next to the pool had holes from our dogs paws in it, and all the new baby plants had been trampled, The majority of them ruined. I tried to reason that it had been an accident and he couldn't control him, but in hindsight he could, as my mum stated, and I didn't want to get on her bad side when she was already upset, so I stayed silent. She then led me to the laundry, and said 'do you remember seeing a pile of towels here?' I told her yes but I thought it was from a pool party, but my mum proceeded to show me a bunch of air pockets that had popped up in the cupboards below where the sink and the towels were, due to water damage. It had made its way all the way through the the bottom of the cupboards, and all of it was ruined and was going to have to be replaced. I asked if she thought this was only from the towels, but she said there wasn't a pool party, and she and dad thought that he had been careless and left the water running and the sink had overflown, and he had used the towels to clean it up. She then took me out to the corridor, where we keep a very larger houseplant near the door to the lounge room. The plant was turning brown, and all the floorboards near the houseplant had raised due to water damage, and were also unfixable. This specific plant has to be put in the sink to be watered otherwise it leaks out the bottom. My dad was apparently particularly upset about this, and though that Jack had forgotten to water the plant for a little while, and then when he did water it, hadn't taken it to the sink and instead watered it there, letting the water flow through onto and underneath the floorboards. Since the plant is big, it takes a lot of water to keep it alive as well. Now I am worried as to what this could become. My mum hasn't told my sister yet and I don't know how she will react. She may be upset at my mum for being so mad about it, but although I see these all as honest mistakes, I can also see why my parents are so upset and are saying he's been careless, because all these things are going to take a lot of time and money to fix. I don't know what to say or do to make it better, and I don't know what my mum should do regarding Jack, as only me, my mum and my dad know about it. My parents are also withholding some things from me, but the other thing I know my mum is upset about is the fact that Jack forgot to put coasters on the wooden coffee table that was made for us by a friend who has since passed, and now has multiple marks on it. I'm scared this will drive a wedge between our family and Jack, as well as his family. I'm also worried that it will cause problems with Sara and Jack. Our family also does whatever we can to not cause issues, so we mostly fix them silently and on our own. Should my mum talk to Jack and Sophie, or should we just fix everything on our own? We would have to wait for a while to fix it, as we saved up to spend a lot of money on our trip of a lifetime. So, is there anything I can or should do?",1,1737881782.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie for sh*ts and giggles. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

This isn't for everyone but Ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-34 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

1ia9qei,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ia9qei/is_my_friend_depressed_or_not_interested_in_our/,Is my friend depressed or not interested in our friendship,"

Hello everyone, I‚Äôm 28 yrs old and After finishing school, I‚Äôve drifted away from some friends. Some friends moved away, got married, etc., so I don‚Äôt really have much of a social circle anymore. I feel like over time, due to a lack of socialization, I‚Äôve lost some social skills.

I have one friend who, honestly, I‚Äôm not sure I would even consider a real friend. We met 3 years ago, and I feel like our relationship has ‚Äústagnated‚Äù and isn‚Äôt progressing somehow. I‚Äôm generally quiet and reserved, and every time we meet, I feel like she‚Äôs uncomfortable around me or even shy(?). She always talks about same things‚Äîclothes, movies, series, books‚Äîbut the way we communicate feels more like an interview than a real conversation. It‚Äôs hard to explain‚Äîvery stiff, like asking a question and giving an answer, and that‚Äôs it. For example know she knows I binge one show and only question she askes me is ,,hey did you watch xx show?""

I‚Äôve also noticed she doesn‚Äôt show much emotion or affect. For example, she‚Äôs never expressed excitement, sadness, joy, or anything else with me; she‚Äôs very formal. I feel like she behaves the same way with me as she does with a coworkers she‚Äôs just met. I‚Äôm naturally introverted too, and I tend to withdraw when I sense that someone is closed off. Even though I try to lighten the mood with humor, it doesn‚Äôt really work.

I constantly suggest new activities we could do besides just having coffee, and she‚Äôll say something like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good idea,‚Äù but then time passes, and we forget about the plans. Eventually, we just go back to having coffee again. I also find it a bit odd that she‚Äôs been in a long-term relationship but never really talks about her boyfriend. When she does, it‚Äôs only because I asked her something small, and even then, it seems like she‚Äôs uncomfortable talking about topics like boys, relationships, or sex in general. This is weird to me because it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre 17 years old. It just feels like she doesn‚Äôt share any ‚Äúemotions‚Äù with me and remains very stiff.

My main issue is that I‚Äôve had a lot of friendships like this in the past where I feel like I don‚Äôt know ‚Äúwhere I stand‚Äù with people. I feel weird and uncomfortable around certain people, and a few times, I‚Äôve tried to resolve issues with friends only for them to distance themselves or cut me off completely when I said something bothered me.

I don‚Äôt know if the problem is with me. I don‚Äôt have much of a social circle or close friends, so I feel like people are uncomfortable around me‚Äîor maybe I‚Äôm just picking the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù friends? For example, when we‚Äôre together, she doesn‚Äôt look at her phone, text, or anything, and she seems interested in hanging out. But then, it feels like she‚Äôs distant and wants to keep things at a surface level. Our communication is formal, almost ‚Äúdry,‚Äù and it seems like I‚Äôm the one initiating everything in our conversations and interactions.

We don‚Äôt have mutual friends, so I don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs like with others. I‚Äôm scared that if I bring this up with her, I‚Äôll hurt her feelings, push her away, or come across as ‚Äúneedy‚Äù and weird. What should I do? 


TL;DR- My friendship with girl I am friends with for 3 years ago is stagnant and stiffed I cant decide is she just plain boring as fuck/depressed or doesnt want to hangout with me.

If you're looking to refresh your living room, modern decor ideas can elevate your space while keeping things sleek and functional. 

[A modern living room is all about clean lines, minimalist designs, and a perfect balance of comfort and style. ](https://www.bestosmosisexperts.com/modern-living-room-decor-ideas/)

Start by choosing neutral color palettes like grays, whites, and earthy tones for walls, furniture, and accessories. You can introduce pops of color through throw pillows, rugs, or art pieces to bring life into the space.

Incorporate statement furniture, such as a low-profile sofa or a geometric coffee table, to create a striking focal point. 

Mixing materials, like wood, metal, and glass, adds texture and visual interest. Lighting plays a vital role, so opt for contemporary floor lamps or pendant lighting to enhance the atmosphere.

Another key element in modern living room design is maximizing space. Use multi-functional furniture like storage ottomans or floating shelves to keep the room organized. 

Don‚Äôt forget about plants! A touch of greenery brings freshness and vitality to the room.

Lately were getting ready to move out of a rental and move into my elder brothers home 33 (F). She talks to him, she complains about me and my brother (21). She draws a needle out the haystack and brings up what we don't do, not all the things we do for her. She likes to make fun of my mental health that she put on me herself for the past 5 years - and along with my brothers mental health. She calls suicide selfish (which Imo is a myth, I don't think it's selfish on the one who suicided, it's the relatives and friends who put their anger out on them and blame them instead of themselves who had driven the suicide to its point.) my mother makes fun of me saying I want to off myself, instead of taking care of her own daughter who is drowning in her own mental issues. Whenever she gets called out, she tarts playing the victim card to my aunt, Nana and (33) brother. She did this recently after literally hitting my (21) brother. 

My mom thinks I'll just snitch on her if I see a therapist. Or if I wan to be checked by a doctor, I should just self diagnose - she then screamed at me because I wanted to get checked, or see a therapist. She gets angry when I stay in my room for safety, or play games to block everything out (no I'm not one of *those* ignorant ones, I take off my headset and turn to her when she comes in.)

There's more but I can't be bothered to add them in for now.

**Sing Your Body Electric**

Sing your body for hiding

The truth in them, prancing

Like a perfect man they are,

Like a perfect woman they are,

Like a perfect person the world expected they are

Not themselves, they can‚Äôt be

They‚Äôre hidden inside the closet

Beneath the sweater four size bigger

Your mum bought you when you were five

Hoping you‚Äôll grow into it somehow,

Do these sweaters fit you now?

\-

Sing your body for dressing

In Designers as they like, Fashion

Like Gucci for the insecurity

Chanel is your personal hell,

Louis V hides your body

Like it‚Äôs a casket. You hide what you considered ugly

Inside a Versace, Dior like you‚Äòre not sure

if you‚Äôre a boy or a girl or whatnot

Your body still asks you what you want inside those Armani pants.

\-

Yet sing your body for surviving

Fashion as they come, wearing

Tight skirts like you‚Äôre a woman

Black shirts like you‚Äôre a man

Sweatshirts like you are neither

Dead or alive, padding inside bras

To fill the gap in your chest,

Binding to feel like you have nothing

Weighing your shoulders. What you actually are

Is a person forever looking for

A reason to stay alive.

So when the devil asks for a dance

You look as good as you can.

\-

And sing your body for growing

Out of their chains, forgiving

A mother‚Äôs expectations

A father‚Äôs disappointment

The owner of the body who keeps on

Drawing lines near their wrists

Praying, ‚Äú*this is it*‚Äù

Yet persistent in staying alive

Oh, how happy your veins must be

Carrying hope through the arteries to where your heart is

A body that cannot stay broken

A body celebrated, a body forgiven.

\-

So sing your body for being

How blessed they are, the entire thing

How perfect a woman is,

How perfect a man is,

How perfect a body outside that dichotomy

How perfect the souls still looking for a body

Fit for themselves

Like shoes on the shelf

Inside the closet

Still waiting to be used

There will be time, pretty high heels,

There will be time to feel like singing your body electric

Sing it fantastic, tantric like it‚Äôs time

For your nakedness to be alive

Proud as you are.",12,1737880613.0,transgamers,2,1.0,False

1ia9i3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ia9i3f/coffee_scrub_a_review/,Coffee scrub: a review,"I‚Äôve been meaning to try making a coffee body scrub from some dried out pucks and have gotten as far as looking up some recipes online. Most seem to involve breaking up pucks and drying them out in a low oven, then blending the grinds with coconut oil and coarse sugar or salt for extra abrasion. Today I was feeling like that was all too much of a fuckabout so I just emptied the contents of my Grindenstein into a bowl and took it with me to the shower.

It was awkward to transfer loose grinds to skin, and this where the coconut oil might have been helpful in acting as a binder and keeping the clump of grinds together. Difficult but not impossible. I lost a lot of grinds but these are not a scarce commodity and I was happy to try the coffee on its own before adding other ingredients. And I‚Äôm happy I did. The coffee by itself seems to retain enough oils to leave my skin feeling scrubbed but also‚Ä¶ dewy? Definitely not dried out, and sort of velvety.

**Hands:** definitely felt softer and smoother.
**Face:** I scrubbed a bit less vigorously because, face. Still less intense than some facial scrubs I used in the 90s that had apricot stones crushed up in them (hey Aapri).
**Legs:** smoother, and helped with little bumps aka keratosis pilaris (KP) aka strawberry legs, and ingrown hairs.
**Arms:** I‚Äôve always had some KP on the upper arms as well and this was definitely improved after just one scrub.
**Armpits:** yes, I thought I‚Äôd give this a go. Not for exfoliation but because sometimes I feel like my armpits retain some body odour even after a good go with body wash and a washcloth. The scrub definitely helped with that, and my pits smelled more like coffee than anything else.

**Final verdict**. I‚Äôll be doing this once a week because I have an endless supply of grinds and my skin is softer and glowier after trying it out today. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever bother with the coconut oil because there was enough skin friendly oils from the coffee by itself. Maybe if I was making a coffee scrub as a gift I‚Äôd include the coconut oil just to make it easier to use, but it also might make for a slipping hazard when used in the shower. Not suitable for baths; way too messy. Salt and sugar as extra exfoliants seem really unnecessary unless you truly want to scrub down to the bone.

A feces like odor is typically caused by gut bacteria or GERD as these conditions disrupt the digestive process and release unpleasant gases. A metallic breath smell is usually a sign of sinus issues like sinusitis. If there‚Äôs a sour taste or odor coming from your tongue, the issue is likely localized to the tongue itself such as bacterial buildup, oral candiadis or poor oral hygiene. Other odors are often tied to what you eat or drink. For instance foods like onions, garlic, fish or beverages like coffee can cause bad breath. Some of these foods release compounds that enter the bloodstream, travel to the lungs and get exhaled with carbon dioxide after the blood is detoxified in the lungs leading to an unusual breath odor.

I'm the pineal gland actor for Cornifer Jr. in Hollow Knight: Silksong. 
I'll probably shouldn't be sharing this classified information from TC and Project: Silksong, but Leth is my BFF so surely I'm going to be fine. 

I'll be honest, Silksong is delaying so much because every character in the game needs an actor for every part of their body, like the pineal gland, adrenal gland, and even the spinal cord. So for every character in the game they need +10.000 actors for every single part of the body of one character. Plus, they need actors for all the parts of structures and architecture, like actors for bricks, stones and things like that. I really don't know why they did it like that, but I think it's for better ambience as the game will have an option for 3D, 4D and 5D and VR. 

Also Team Cherry don't work at their usual place anymore. They created, plannified and built the first ever ""Songsilk Megastructure"" under the ""Uluru"" mountain. It's an structure of more than +300 Km. deep and 10 Km. of broad. 

I tried going deeper but Leth told me not to, because there is an uncomprehensible force that makes reality twist within its reach, making it easier for TC to hire more actors for every single thing in the game. 
They tried waking up Chtulhu for more power but they failed. They tried making an offer to God, but they failed. All of this lead to this singular point in space and time that twisted and deformed everything. 
They evoke the Silkgularity. 
And since that day, they remained silent, for not to make humanity suspicious of the Silkgularity plans.
After that day I went with my work normally, trying not to awknolodge the real reason behind the Silkgularity. I made my coffee and I went to the studio for my role of Cornifer Jr.'s pineal gland, trying to make everything perfect  so that William doesn't gets angry. While I was in the little room I overheard that TC will have a meeting with somebody deep within the Songsilk Megastructure.
I sneak past the guards of the Megastructure, so that they don't eliminate me with their silk cannons, and when I sneaked through a room, I saw the giant meeting room with TC and a glowing mass that looked like this: -Y

And well, there they were; Leth, Ari and William  having a meeting with the Silkgularity guard, the pawn that is key for Proyect: Songsilk last plan: make THE GAME... Skong... 

The Silkgularity makes everything possible! You can hear Gorb, Hornet, Cornifer and even the knight! I SWEAR THE SILKGULARITY IS ABOUT TO BREAK, THE RIFT WILL GET UNCONTROLLABLE.

So there was this profile managed by parents(without any photos). Her profession and place were fine by me. We matched they asked where do work, to which replied. Next thing they asked for my parents's contact to proceed to which said l'd like to meet her before(| don't know how it works and I was taking a dating approachl guess). And they asked meet as in? Then replied 'meet as in get to know her over a coffee, what she is looking for, her preferences!. We both are in blr according to the profile.


I want to know if this was wrong and how to navigate this if parents are on the other side. Another thought I'm having is if a girl said this it would have been fine saying this as a guy makes me a creep? 


Also didn't want to involve my parents because they won't have much say in it they'll ask me to decide so before knowing her I didn't feel it's right to involve them. Also if the girl's parents tell them that they found me online my parents will keep asking for updates about new matches.",17,1737879316.0,AmItheKameena,30,0.9,False
1ia98w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1ia98w0/rehoming_my_new_dog_because_i_am_having_a/,Rehoming my new dog because I am having a terrible time coping,"I'm awaiting to get tested formally, however, my therapist and I are handling therapy and my problems with my adopted pup under the assumption I have autism. All signs lead to it dating back to childhood. 

So I adopted a 7mo puppy a little over three months ago, and she's an angel. However, I am having the worst time coping, and I have made the difficult decision with my support team to rehome her.

I was looking for support if anyone has had this issue. 

Background: had a cat for 16 years, and he was my soul buddy. Waited almost a year before seriously considering another animal. Went with a dog to avoid expecting a new cat to act like my old one. I'm almost 40. Have lived with dogs before. Had a childhood dog I grew up with part time. So, I'm familiar with dogs and the expectations. 

Where I went wrong I think is getting a puppy (7mo), getting a puppy on my own, getting a puppy in an apartment complex, and getting a puppy at the start of winter. However, in contemplating I think a dog of any age would be difficult for me.

I expected: the walks, the feeding, the playtime, the training 

What I didn't expect: the walks to be a nightmare for me. 
Transitions to being outside being difficult, especially in an apartment complex and in the mornings. I have to take the stairs down so I can avoid all the cheery chipper morning people in the elevator, which already is a struggle for me. Coming up in the elevator for some reason I can handle. 

Outside, I have a hard time with thinking people are judging me for my dogs behaviors and how I handle them. I have a hard time with her stopping every 2 seconds to sniff versus a long steady pace. I've tried headphones, which comes with its own sensory difficulties. I can't listen to music or podcasts or be on the phone (all things I enjoy while walking), because my attention is 100% on her and training her the whole time. 

Then don't even get me started on picking up the poop and the smell associated with it. Again, knew what I was getting in for, and I don't understand why now it's such an issue.

Mornings are most difficult, as they always have been my entire life. Having to walk her almost immediately when I wake up has been an incredible routine struggle. I've managed to get a cup of coffee in before our walks now which helps immensely, but not having my normal routine to reset from sleep to my day is still a struggle I didn't anticipate.

Coming home from work, I want to relax and reset, but I have to take her out immediately. Then I come home and it's dinner and then she wants to play for 3-4 hours. Which is exhausting when it's only me to entertain her and find new games for her to play. Which further disrupts my shit, which makes the coping with life so hard.

I even have a hard time with her following me in the house, which I've implemented baby gates which she's taken well to, but it feels like I'm living with a roommate instead of a pet.

All of this is to say that I feel like an absolute scumbag monster who is failing at taking care of a puppy because I am having so many problems coping that I never experienced before or expected. I get joy out of other dogs, and sometimes her, but more often than not I literally am having the hardest time regulating and managing my emotions due to the above.

I read one blogger who explained all of this better, but I wanted more opinions to see if others have experienced a difficult time caring for a dog unexpectedly. I know they're supposed to also be good since they're easier to interpret, but the cons are outweighing the pros for me and I know she's a puppy but I'm struggling hour per hour and I can't keep up with hopes that when she's 2 it'll be better. 

Again, it's not her fault. She's an angel and so well behaved and I feel so fucking bad because all she wants is love and attention and I need like 25% less from her and then I could handle it more I think. Like cats they do their own things and it was perfect.

TL;DR I fucked up and feel like a monster and I didn't predict that I couldn't cope and was wondering if other people struggled literally due to sensory and disregulation. ",1,1737879306.0,autism,1,1.0,False

Now he thinks I might be fooling around on him. Advice?,"Hi all! Straight to the chase. In October of last year I was flying in from a work trip. I ended up taking the bus to a terminal closer to my house. A much older gentleman(late 60s) boarded before me and the driver said no cash. The guy says I don't have a debit card. I tell him here let me pay. He offers me the money and I say it's ok just keep it. I had this feeling this guy was struggling or not financially in a good place. He smelled. Looked disheveled; just a bit of a mess. 

He sits next to me and he starts talking to me shares his life story. I just listened. Again I just felt like he needed some compassion. He shares how he is recruiting musicians from different countries and wants to host an event in July. He asked me to write my number down so he can invite me. Even says bring your family. Mind you I'm not looking into this at all. I'm thinking I will never see this person again! I was so wrong. 

He randomly calls me today. The only reason I picked up is it was the same area code as a college I am applying to. Clearly I didn't know who it was until he reminded me. He starts off hey this is so remember me and then says my car is broken down. Obviously this is weird. I'm trying to play it off and I got kind of nervous so I hung up. My fianc√© and daughter were right next to me and all I was thinking was how is this going to look. He calls me back and I put him on speaker. I say I was just explaining to my fiance how we met and his response was yes I am sorry I never reached out after that day. He says I was hoping we can get coffee and I tell him no I'm sorry I'm not interested. He says I understand I don't want any trouble and we hang up. 

Something like this has never happened so now I am in the doghouse üò≠ I don't blame my partner for being upset or kind of curious as to wtf is going on. I would probably be 10x more dramatic than he is right now. I want to make it right and for him to believe me. I would never betray him and he knows this. How the hell do I get out of this? 


Tldr; I tried to do a good deed and now I'm being punished with said good deed. Help!!! ",3,1737879140.0,relationship_advice,9,0.8,False
