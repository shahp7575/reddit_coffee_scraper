Months ago, my uric acid was at 9.8 mg/dL and my doctor prescribed to take Febuxostat for a month which I did and my uric acid went down to a normal level. He then requested to do another uric acid test after a month after stopping the medicine and my uric acid has reached another ""high"" level (forgot exactly the numbers) and was prescribed again with a month of Febuxostat. 

We've been doing this on-off with Febuxostat for months now (on 4th iteration now) and been having the same results (w/ Febuxostat = normal; w/o Febuxostat = high). Doc is insisting that it is because of food but I've avoiding most of the sugary foods and red meat but uric acid seems to go back to the same as before when I was still eating these foods the moment I stop on taking the medicine.

Luckily, I haven't had any flares ever since and the high level uric acid was only detected during a general checkup but this is getting tiring lol.

My mother also had a high uric acid level before and was given by a different doctor a 2 months of daily Febuxostat then went down to taking it every other day on its 3rd month up to now (\~5th month). Similar to what I've been reading online, her doctor says that it is a long term medication. Our doctors seem to have other contradicting advice such as with foods like coffee. Her doctor and online articles or videos by other doctors say it's fine and might even be helpful while my doctor is saying that coffee is bad for uric acid. 

Should I try going to a different doctor? Can't go to the same doctor as my mother due to schedule.",1,1728914191.0,gout,1,1.0,False

While awaiting his sentencing, my dad lived with my grandpa in his house and assisted him with day to day activities. When he was eventually sentenced (10yrs), he felt my grandpa was still okay to live alone so we didn’t change anything about our arrangement. My mom divorced my dad and moved to the city I live in about 300 miles away.  He’s alone in my hometown now which breaks my heart, but he has a good group of friends that he has known since long before I was born that look out for him. They get coffee almost everyday at 6am. They are usually the ones to assist him now if something happens. 

We had a little bit of a scare this week. I texted my grandpa on Sunday and he usually responds quickly but he didn’t respond this time. By Wednesday his housekeeper had contacted my mom and told us she couldn’t get into contact with him, and the last time they had spoken was on Monday and he told her he was going to the ER. My mom alerted my dad’s childhood best friend who lives several hours closer to him than we do and we started trying to call him. Eventually he answered and told us he had a stomach bug and hadn’t been checking his cell. I’ve been texting him to check in and he’s responding now, but I asked him to give me and my mom his friends numbers since they’re the ones he called to look after him while he was sick and he read my text and didn’t respond. 

I’m planning on going to see him in November, sooner if I can because of everything that happened this week but I work as a retail manager so it’s difficult for me to get time off when I have to cover other people’s time off requests. I’ve been very anxious about him all weekend, I know he won’t want a live in helper. I’m not even sure if it’s to that point yet. I just want to be in the loop when something happens so I can take off work to be with him. My grandpa isn’t very fond of my mom because she divorced my dad after his arrest (she was valid) so I assume that’s why I’m kept out of the loop, but I don’t want to find out something happened when it’s too late. How can I get him to tell me when he goes to the hospital? His only other family is in a different state and is too old to travel to be with him.

I’m a 40-year-old (almost 41) man from Dublin, and I’m writing this because I've hit a bit of a deadend when it comes to finding a partner. Due to the current housing situation, I’m living with my parents—whom I love dearly (though, being honest, Ive considered strangling them while they’ve slept!...... I haven’t). But living at home in your 40s can do that.

I’ve always been a helpless romantic, the type of guy who imagined that moment where the love of my life would just walk through the door, and I’d know it instantly. But Dublin's dating scene has kicked the crap out of me. It’s beaten me down, slowly but surely, and I’ve found myself becoming bitter towards the whole process. Dating apps? Not for me. I’ve tried singles nights and have been set up by friends— and there have been some great experiences, but it just doesn’t feel like it’s going to happen.

I’ve never had a long, meaningful relationship, and that’s something I truly want. I know relationships can be hard, but I’ve done the lonely thing long enough, and I’m ready for the pain/challenge/excitement that comes with finding something real. I have a decent-paying job that I enjoy, I’m creative, and I go to the gym a few nights a week. I’m follicle-challenged (yes, a bald man!) but I take care of myself. I’m kind, thoughtful, and a romantic. Touch is definitely my love language, and for an ideal date, something a bit different would be fun—though a simple dinner, coffee, or drink is great for getting to know someone.

I’m not looking for advice on where to meet people—I’ve tried it all, and it doesn’t work for me. What I really want is to meet someone who genuinely wants to get to know someone new. Someone who looks for the good in others, like I do, instead of reasons not to like a person.

I wouldn’t say I’m typically attractive, but I like to think I’m handsome in my own way. I dress well, I’m in decent shape, and I’m ready to buy my own home (just searching for the right option). I’m good company, though I do get anxious, nervous, and insecure sometimes, but I’d have all the patience in the world for someone who feels the same.

So, if you’re out there, and I just haven’t found you yet, please say hello. I’d love to meet someone who’s also searching for that special connection. Maybe we can stop looking and find something real together.

My schedule was a little funky at first but now I’ve been working an entire week (7 nights, 8 hours each as a part time worker…) and so far, it’s pretty easy. Aside from co-workers being annoyed with me for needing help with certain things (literal eye rolls lol) I can handle it. 

However, last night it was pretty hectic. It was very busy. What almost made me lose it, however, was a group of pretty drunk people came in. They were loud, obnoxious and honestly just unpleasant. But whatever. Stuff happens, I’ll get over it. Then they ordered food and sat in the dining area. Now, typically, if you move a table half way across the room, the least you could do is, Idk, move it back?? I guess not. Stayed for over 2 hours, left and left everything a mess. 

What’s funnier, is there’s a dunkin right across the street that I used to work at.

I feel wired, like I am plugged into a constant energy source. My thoughts are all jumbled up. It makes it hard to talk to people or to focus on things happening in the moment. I feel really jittery, almost like my bones are vibrating in my body. I don't know if this shaking is visible to other people though. I feel over-caffeinated even when I have had none. I am trying to avoid interacting with other people because I feel like I just ramble and rattle off whatever is in my head, and I think that can come across as pretty off-putting.

Oftentimes my heart will start to race and I have a hard time catching my breath, sometimes it will be severe enough where I can write it off as a panic attack (which I used to significantly struggle from when I was a teen), but other times it just seems like an underlying sensation that I can kind of tune out.

Emotionally, I'm in a pretty good place and I'm feeling pretty optimistic and content about things. I'm really prone to severe depressive phases, so I am pretty relieved that those feelings aren't' present. However, I have seen a massive spike in my anxiety. It's unbearable. I have also been way more impatient and grumpy than usual, which is strange as normally I am a very laid back person. It's really the anxiety though that is hurting me.

Early into when these symptoms started appearing, about mid-September, I was experiencing sleep disruptions where I would wake up multiple times in the middle of the night, oftentimes anxious. That hasn't happened as much lately, and I am sleeping mostly fine, except I had two nights this week where I got *maybe* an hour and a half of sleep, and not even that could help clear my system. Like I said, it just feels like I am perpetually over-caffeinated, even when I have had no caffeine.

I am at a loss. I am trying to get myself to chill out, focus on my art, do yoga, lay off the coffee (which I have been drinking for years and years), because I feel like other people are noticing that I've seemed pretty wired lately, and like I said, I've been isolating myself as a result. This has happened before, people have mentioned it before, but it usually doesn't stick around for this long long, only a few days to a week. Other than some social drinks once or twice a week, I do not use any substances.

I think that what I am experiencing is psychological, but I just don't know how to fix it. I just want to get back to feeling normal again. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!",1,1728913420.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1g3g31k,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1g3g31k/rich_beyond_measure_the_family_who_turned_down/,Rich Beyond Measure: The Family Who Turned Down the Lottery,"The Thompson family lived a modest life in the small town of Willow Creek. The family consisted of Sarah and Tom Thompson and their two kids, Emily and Jack. Tom worked as a mechanic, spending long days in his garage fixing up cars, while Sarah ran a small bakery in town. They weren't wealthy by any means, but they were happy. They had a cozy home, good friends, and a strong bond that held them together through thick and thin.

One sunny Saturday morning, Tom sat at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee in one hand and a lottery ticket in the other. He had bought the ticket on a whim the night before, not expecting anything from it. As he started to check the numbers, he let out a loud gasp.

""Sarah, you need to see this,"" he called, his voice trembling.

Sarah rushed over, wiping her flour-covered hands on her apron. ""What is it, Tom?""

""We won,"" Tom said, his eyes wide with disbelief. ""We actually won the lottery. A hundred million dollars!""

For a moment, the world seemed to stop. Emily and Jack, who had been playing in the living room, came running into the kitchen, their faces alight with excitement.

""We’re rich!"" Emily shouted, already imagining all the toys and gadgets she could buy.

But Sarah didn't share the immediate enthusiasm. She looked at Tom, then at their children, and then out the window at their small but well-loved home. She thought of the bakery, the community they’d built in Willow Creek, and all the little things that made their life uniquely theirs.

""Tom,"" Sarah said slowly, ""what would this kind of money do to us? To our family?""

Tom's excitement began to fade as he understood what she was getting at. They had seen it happen before—a neighbor, a friend of a friend, who won a fortune and lost everything else that mattered in the process. The money brought greed, jealousy, and people they hadn’t spoken to in years suddenly knocking on their door, wanting a piece of the prize.

""Think of how our lives would change,"" Sarah continued. ""We’d have to move, hire security, deal with people treating us differently. Our kids wouldn’t grow up the same way; they wouldn’t learn the value of hard work and kindness like we have.""

Emily and Jack looked up at their parents, confused. ""But, Mom, we could have everything we ever wanted,"" Jack said.

Sarah knelt down to their level and took their hands. ""I know, sweetheart. But sometimes, having everything isn’t as important as knowing what really matters. We have a good life here. We’re happy because we have each other, because we work hard for what we have. Money can’t buy that.""

Tom nodded in agreement. ""We could use a little more to make life comfortable, sure, but not like this. Not at the cost of losing who we are.""

After a long family discussion, they made the decision together. Tom called the lottery office and explained that they wouldn’t be accepting the winnings. They would ask for their anonymity to be respected and would continue with their lives just as they were.

Word spread around town, and while some people thought they were crazy, most admired their courage. The Thompson family became known for something even more valuable than their would-be fortune: their commitment to each other and their values.

As the days went on, life returned to its usual rhythm for the Thompsons. Tom continued working at the garage, Sarah baked her famous cinnamon rolls at the bakery, and the kids went to school, knowing that their family had made a choice not to let money change what they cherished most.

I was completely paralysed but fully conscious and was trying my best to shout for help.

I get 9 hours sleep every night, sometimes I can wake up during the night but this is rare, I normally sleep through. I do however experience sleep paralysis quite often, I am fully conscious but can't wake myself up from what feels like a nightmare. I also experience dreams quite fast, sometimes I can nap for 20 minutes but when I wake up I have full recollection of multiple dreams, I often confuse this with reality. I am also 100% certain I could drink a pint of coffee and still fall asleep just fine afterwards. Is this going to get worse?

At one point I dialed back my obsessing over coffee due to the overall craziness of work denands, and sold my Aeropress, my Espro FP, a couple of other FPs, my espresso machine, my roaster... You get the picture.

So giving the B75 a go, I wasn't expecting much to be honest.  It's way smaller than I expected.  Brewing 300 grams in 3 pours pushes the envelope.  Probably get the 185 filters after the Timemore ones are gone.

I'm using my Hario hand grinder while I'm waiting on a replacement Ode, so grind is inconsistent.

1g3fzuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenMarriage/comments/1g3fzuj/open_marriage_question_newbie/,"Open marriage question, newbie ","Hello all ,

I am married to a really cool guy. F49/ M51 -We have a great time together but we haven't had sex in a very long time and when I say a long time, I mean long time. He's just not interested.(Medication, depression that he keeps at bay and maybe a little bit of asexual?, maybe bisexuality?) Not sure because we don't communicate about it.  I keep myself fit and I would say that I'm good in the sack lol so that's not an issue. 

For many years, I would lay their silently crying wondering what was wrong with me and then finally I got to a place where it didn't bother me because finally I had a guy that loved me I felt comfortable with and we had a good time. I have never wanted him to feel guilty or to feel embarrassed about it so I've always kid glove his feelings but would definitely come on to him from time to time probably once every 6 months. Mostly trying to take care of his feelings. Feelings of rejection get to you after a while that's for sure. 

Side note, we do hold hands, sometimes hold hands when we're sleeping. Always give each other a hug when we see each other a peck on the lips before we go to sleep and when we wake up. He brings me coffee in bed and I bring him coffee in bed. So it's not completely void of goodness.

This year, I decided I can't go on like this (no passion) especially since our cool relationship has turned into a lot of bickering for the past couple of years with no communication. Not for lack of trying to get communication but again, I just don't want to argue or fight so I generally shy away whenever he doesn't want to communicate. Really it's the communication or lack thereof that has really broke the camel's back for me. I've got to feel like there's a volley or feel like there is something that we can talk about other than surface stuff. 

My hormones are raging and going crazy so recently (libido) I said to myself that I'm going to come on to him one last time and if he's not receptive I'm going to force the issue with communication but obviously in a kind way. I started trying to have intimate kissing with him, he said I'm not in the mood and I said you haven't been in the mood for more than a decade and he said I'm sorry I just there's nothing. And I said that I don't feel it's fair to me that we're celibate and that my hormones are going crazy. I told him I felt guilty about the fact that I had been secretly researching open marriages and seeing what people are saying on Reddit and I felt guilty and I wanted to come out about that. And he  said to me, he's been trying to build up the guts to tell me to have an affair but just to stay together because he doesn't want to lose me. He was afraid of what I would think or if it would blow up our marriage if he suggested that.. That was the most communication I had gotten out of him maybe my whole marriage. 

I'm pretty open about such things even though I've never been in a situation like that before besides a couple of threesomes when I was younger.  I've been around alternative situations my whole life so it didn't shock me and it actually made me kind of happy that he wasn't as selfish as I thought he was about my needs. However, I wish he would have told me this years ago.

Before I start exploring such things, just wanted to get some advice. I've tried to bring it up a few times since to get clarification and he doesn't want to talk about it he just says what more is there to say? Why do you need clarification. So again I shy away from upsetting him. But the thing is, every since we had that conversation, we haven't bickered not even one time. We've actually been getting along really well so I feel like it lifted a weight off of him just like it did me. I do want to take him up on his offer but I don't know how to get started. 

A little bit about me, I am very monogamous meaning, normally if I have sex with somebody, I really consider it carefully and then I end up in a very long relationships. So .. I am afraid that I may end up getting feelings if I have sex with somebody.

How do you manage your feelings?
 
I do want to go to marriage counseling with him but he insists that he get his own therapist or psychiatrist to deal with his intimacy issues and that I should talk to somebody if I want to. I think there's probably things that he might be embarrassed to see in front of me.

One other addition. I do know people that are Poly and it sounds slightly interesting to me because I don't see myself just randomly hooking up with people. Sorry if my thoughts are all scattered, I'm just new to all this.

Thank you for advice.

my boyfriend and i have been together for 1.5 years. we had plans of moving in but they unfortunately got pushed back 2 years, and as of right now we still have 1-1.5 years before we move in. it’s neither of our faults, it’s just the way that everything worked out. we have no relationship issues. everything’s great. 

i don’t feel like i can do it.

 im in an accelerated nursing program and everytime we have “visits” to see one another they just stress me out. i have to get ahead on school work because we don’t have breaks, so i have to miss classes also. i also completely provide for myself financially so whenever we have a visit it puts me in a hard financial spot for a bit because i had to miss work for the visit and also buy the plane tickets, gas money, etc. he does pay for 90% of expenses during the visits but missing work for a week does put a dent in my paycheck. 
also, even just driving to the airport and finding flights feels like a hassle to me. 

do i end things? I haven’t been in a for real in person relationship so I don’t know what im missing out on. I just find myself so jealous of couples who go in coffee shops and study together whenever I have to do it alone, for example. or weekend dates instead of FaceTime movies. 

it’s just really hard, and I don’t want to be an ass for breaking up because im “a coward” and “can’t stick it out” or something. but it is genuinely very hard on me. and I don’t feel like loving somebody should have so many obstacles. 

do I just cut it off? and if yes, how???

I am an American foreigner who had been shopping in the Glorietta mall today. I went to the McDonalds above the Makati Activity Center in, I think, Glorietta 4.

As I ordered, a woman who was probably 5', a little overweight and is probably in her 40s stood behind me in line. She was also wearing dark shades and a Shell oil baseball cap. I finished placing my order, grabbed my number for delivery to my table. I noticed she didn't order anything after standing in line behind me. This put me on edge.

I sat down in the far corner of the McDonalds and as I sat she sat down facing me one table up and over and kept watching me. I immediately stood up and walked to the other end of the McDonalds and put my number down at another table, and she repositioned herself at another table to stare at me. 

At this point I knew there was something wrong, as my order came up, she decided to grab it from the counter and hand it to me instead of a McDonalds employee. I looked confused and said thank you, but she returned to her seat. I blew through all my food fast and decided my best course of action would be to move quickly from the McDonalds to an entrance with a security guard. 

I executed this maneuver at a rushed pace and she followed me immediately to where I was. She pointed to the exit and said: There's the exit. -- which I felt would put me at a disadvantage away from the relative safety of the mall itself and the security guard I was next to.

Unfortunately, the security guard was not interested in getting involved at all and effectively ignored the situation. I said loudly enough so he could hear when she started to try to talk to me that I wasn't interested, and I didn't know her, and she was making me uncomfortable by following me from the McDonalds. I stood there uncomfortably for about 10 minutes and explained that if she wouldn't leave me alone I would need to find the authorities. 

She was being very odd, but did say ""this is the word for money"", I think in an attempt for me to bribe her to leave me alone. I was just considering my next move of going to another exit with hopefully more responsive security guards and a place I could pick-up a Grab, but I was saved by another customer who I had been around earlier that day at a shop. 

He recognized me and asked if I was okay, and I said I wasn't, and he started talking to the woman in Filipino and effectively chased her away, quite literally. She said something about having worked for the Shell corporation and having gotten a salary or something to him. Her story didn't seem to make sense to him (or me.) 

His girlfriend came around the corner and tried asking the security guard why he wasn't doing anything. D (name redacted to protect the innocent) and his girlfriend were the real ones here, heartfelt thanks for their help out. If they read this by some chance, feel free to DM me. I definitely owe you a meal or a beer/coffee. 

They walked me to the Grab stand and explained what happened to the guard there, and I was able to get a Grab out of there shortly after. 

She gave me the vibe of someone who was not going to let go, and I was definitely not going to be strong-armed, so I am just glad it resolved not in an ugly way.

1g3fj9m,https://i.redd.it/lb9mjr6m2qud1.jpeg,"Review on the New Nespresso Pods: Almond Croissant, Peanut & Roasted Sesame, Unforgettable Espresso","Today, the three new Jean Imbert capsules were released by Nespresso in my country. Here is my review of them:

Almond Croissant Flavour - 7/10
The almond aroma is very strong, resembling the almond extract used in pastries. It has a slightly oilier texture compared to the other capsules, similar to the Coconut Flavour over Ice. The coffee flavor is barely noticeable, while the almond taste is extremely dominant. If you drink it straight from the machine, it’s one of the most bitter I’ve tasted so far. However, with some sugar, the taste improves significantly.

Peanut & Roasted Sesame Flavour - 9/10
The sesame aroma is quite subtle, while the peanut and sesame flavors are pronounced. It doesn’t have the oily texture found in the Almond Croissant capsule; in fact, it slightly resembles the Italian Ristretto. The peanut, sesame, and coffee flavors are perfectly balanced. Adding milk enhances the flavor even more, and the bitterness is reduced.

Unforgettable Espresso - 9/10
It smells just like the Kazaar capsules but tastes better, with a profile similar to Arpeggio. Unlike the previous capsules, this one can be enjoyed straight from the machine without needing milk, sugar, or other flavor enhancers.

In conclusion, I enjoyed all three of the new capsules, with the sesame one being a particularly pleasant surprise. Generally, I prefer drinking my coffee straight from the machine, but in this case, only the Unforgettable Espresso is suited for that.",17,1728911862.0,nespresso,5,0.9,False

Hey everyone!

I recently tried making **Breve Coffee** at home and wanted to share the recipe with you all. If you’re a fan of creamy, high-protein coffee drinks or just looking to elevate your daily brew, this breve is perfect! ☕🍶

**Ingredients:**

* 2 shots espresso (about 2 ounces)
* 6 ounces half-and-half
* 1-2 teaspoons sugar (optional, adjust to taste)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
* Cocoa powder or cinnamon (for garnish, optional)
* Whipped cream (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Espresso:** Grind your espresso beans to a fine consistency and brew 2 shots using an espresso machine. If you don't have an espresso machine, you can use a Moka pot or French press to make strong coffee.
2. **Steam the Half-and-Half:** Pour 6 ounces of half-and-half into a steaming pitcher. Using the steam wand on your espresso machine, steam the half-and-half until it reaches about 150°F (65°C) with a velvety microfoam.
3. **Combine:** Pour the freshly brewed espresso into a ceramic mug. Slowly add the steamed half-and-half, holding back the foam with a spoon. Top with a layer of microfoam.
4. **Sweeten and Flavor (Optional):** Add 1-2 teaspoons of sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract if desired. Stir gently to incorporate without disturbing the foam.
5. **Garnish and Serve:** Lightly dust with cocoa powder or cinnamon and add a dollop of whipped cream for an extra indulgent touch. Serve immediately.

**Tips:**

* Use freshly ground coffee beans for the best flavor.
* Practice your steaming technique to achieve the perfect microfoam.
* Experiment with different flavorings like caramel syrup or hazelnut extract.

Here’s a [link to the full detailed recipe](https://www.easyrecipesy.com/posts/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-breve-coffee) with photos and nutritional information. Let me know if you try it or have any questions! Happy brewing! ☕🔥

1g3f92f,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1g3f92f/i_think_im_going_to_crash_the_wedding_of_the/,I think I’m going to crash the wedding of the woman I love,"Yeah, can’t really tell anyone about this. I just kinda need to do it. It’s selfish of me but I have to. I can’t live knowing I didn’t. 

Context? I met Megan when I was 17, fell in love with her when I was 18 and started dating her when I was 20. She’s my age. We went to the same college and then uni and met each other through mutual friends. She was a friend for a while and that’s all I saw her as and then I don’t know I just loved her. It had been coming on so gradually I didn’t catch it. And when I did I swore I wouldn’t tell her, I couldn’t do it to our friendship.

Lasted a year and then fessed up and we ended up going out because she felt the same. We dated for 2 years. A good fucking 2 years. It was the kind of love that the people in those stupid movies had. I was obsessed with her, she was all I wanted. But we couldn’t communicate. It had been a tiny issue in our friendship that had been magnified when we got together. 

When she was pissed, upset she wanted to be left alone. Not in the way where people say they want to be alone and don’t mean it - she actually wanted to be alone. She’s a very independent woman. And when I’m mad? I need to talk. We have to have it out. And she just wouldn’t. I’d take screaming matches and broken plates over silence, over nothing. So I’d make the situation worse, ramp it up so that she would be forced to have it out with me. It was making her miserable and it was making me miserable. I tried to be like her and give her the space she’d need but I was just fucking sick the whole time. I couldn’t concentrate. And I realised that I needed her in a way she didn’t need me. It wasn’t healthy, I had put her on a pedestal she couldn’t meet. 

She got a job offer fresh out of graduation in New York (an english writing thing) (we’re from London) and we both knew we wouldn’t survive long distance. 

We broke up, mutually, It was rough. I went right up to the airport with her. It kinda felt like my heart was walking outside of my body. We knew if we were done we had to be DONE. She blocked me and I blocked her. After six months (of really trying to get myself together) I started dating again. I had girlfriends, I went to law school (in my last year, i’m 24 - 25 in a month) and I never heard about her again. Until two years later, it was really weird I just bumped into her when I was on a walk around Hyde Park. 

God, people, she’s so beautiful. Even after all the years she’s fucking stunning. She dyed her hair back to brown (natural colour) she was dressed different and…god I just wanted to know her. 

She chatted to me, we were both free so we figured we’d grab coffee at a coffee shop. She’s always cold, she kept her gloves and coat on. We talked for two hours. I went into the talk interested in friendship and walked away from it in love with her. 

We talked about even thing. Work, her time in America, our friends, our families, old jokes, what we wanted from the world. It was like nothing had passed but it had. She was different, her views had changed and what she wanted for herself had changed but she was still Megan. I still loved her. 

She took her gloves off at the end and the ring on her finger…fuck. I asked her about it, couldn’t not. She told me she met someone in America, nine months in. They’d been together a year before he proposed. A year? She’d always sworn she needed to be with someone for two minimum. 

I asked her about him she said, “He’s nice and he listens to me, he makes me happy.” He’s nice? Chocolate is nice? A dog is nice you just described the qualities of a dog. 

We parted ways, I unblocked her and she unblocked me. We still have many mutual friends so once we let them know we were bag on good terms everyone started getting along much better and her and I hung out. 

This started in May - it’s October. I am in love with her. I’ve tried to stop, I’ve tried to get with other women. Sure it works and I care for them far too little than seems appropriate. I just want her. 

I’ve met her fiancé ‘Mark’ maybe I’m fucking biased but jesus fuck. You know how I’ll describe him? Roy from the office. 

He’s far too arrogant for what he has to offer, how he behaves around Megan and how he behaves when she’s not around is shocking. Yes with her he’s nice, does listen to her. When she’s not around he’s loud, short, cocky, selfish, self centred. And all our friends agree but she just won’t see it. I don’t know what she sees in him. 

On October 1st her and I went to a friends house party together (house warming?) she got tipsy and I was the DD. I was driving her home and parked in front of her house. Here’s the following conversation. Damn right I memorised it.

“We’re here, I’ll walk you to the door.” “I hate having an empty house.” “Where’s ’Mark’ tonight?” “Watching the football at the pub.” “Ah, it’s late he should be back.” “Doubt it.” “….” “Would you like to come in?” “I’ll walk you to the door.” “And then?” “And then I’m walking back to my car.” “Ever the saint Julian.” “Mm.” “I wish you weren’t sometimes, I wish you were the type of man who…” “Who what?” “Says the things no one else wants to.” “I usually do no?” “Then why won’t you say it here.” “Say what?” “I don’t know.” “Why aren’t you the type of woman who says what she wants?” “Because I’m scared of what I want.” “What do you want?” “That’s the question.” “And I can’t answer it for you.” “I know.” “I’ll walk you to the door.” “Okay.” 

And I did and she goes “If you had just asked me to, I would have.” “Asked you to do what?” “Leave.” “Leave what?” “….” “You’re drunk.” “Yes.” “Good night.” “Night.” 

And then I had to get a damn plane for a wedding and a funeral both in Italy and I was gone for two weeks. And I came back, October 12th and realised she’s getting married on the fifteenth. I’ve tired to contact her with no avail. Her friends say she’s already at the cabin where she’s getting married and there’s no fucking service like my life isn’t hard enough. So now what? I let that go? I get her go? I can’t. I fucking can’t. and I don’t think she wants me to. Isn’t that what she meant? That if I asked she’d leave him. She deserves better and I don’t know if I’m the better but I’ll try. I’m older, more mature than I was so is she. 

If I leave tonight I’ll make it for the morning of her wedding. I have no other way to reach her. I don’t even know what I’d say. But I can’t let her marry him without telling her I love her. Even if I lose her all over again. Better that. 

So I think I’m going to do it, I have to right?

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

October 13th marks the day I broke my Marathon PR by 14 minutes. This being only my second marathon, I ran a 2:41:30. I am still absolutely in awe, and it's now just one day after the event. Let me break down the event and everything leading up to it.

**Training**

How did training go? Well, I couldn't be happier with how this marathon block went. Training for this Marathon started on June 25th, 2024, exactly 105 days prior to the day of the event. This was my first (long) marathon block while being coached. Let me take a moment to emphasize the value of having a coach. It keeps you accountable every single day and makes it so much easier to determine what training session you should do, when, and how. If I were to coach myself, I would likely be too harsh. The accountability is another major benefit. You're not just training for yourself but for someone else too.

I had such a great weekly training structure. Mondays were always a rest day (usually an upper strength session), Tuesdays a hard track session plus a lower body strength session, Wednesdays an easy run, Thursdays a longer change of pace run, Fridays rest (and usually an upper strength session), Saturdays a marathon-paced effort, and Sundays a long run. This five-run-day-a-week structure plus three strength sessions was really nice, and I loved the consistency.

I must say how amazingly consistent I was. Overall, throughout all the training sessions, I only missed 3 sessions, and this was due to mental fatigue rather than physical fatigue. I am very proud of the consistency and dedication that I showed during this preparation. I truly believe that the goal of 2:45 kept me going and therefore kept me accountable to the goal.

Now let's talk about the event itself.

**The Day Before**

Let's start with the day before. I was at work (Runnersworld), and although the store was unexpectedly very busy, it left me with an even bigger fire within me. The number of people aware of me running this race and my time goal gave me a nice amount of stress. This stress added to my absolute determination to achieve this goal. I did everything I could during training to achieve this, and therefore I was HYPED UP. In the days leading up, I perfectly carbed up, with 400-500g of carbs a day, and on the morning of the race, I had 140 grams of carbs. What did I do exactly? I went to bed at 20:00 the night before and then woke up at 6:00, getting an amazing 10 hours of sleep.

**The Day Itself**

Upon waking, around 7 am, I had my breakfast with a coffee. The breakfast included a bagel with honey and a banana, coming up to around 100 grams of carbs. At around 8:30, I started walking towards the starting line, and just walking there hyped me up as I was able to soak in the atmosphere. Prior to the race, I sipped on my sports/electrolyte drink with 40 grams of carbs and 600mg of sodium. This got me in the zone while waiting to line up for the race.

I was at the start line at around 9:00, and the race started at 10:00. Between this time, I sipped on my drink and did some general warming up, including dynamic movements and some accelerations. By 9:45, I was in the starting corral, and the nerves started rising. This time, unlike my previous marathon, I was able to start in corral A, very close to the elite runners. This was SO good since I didn't have to weave and move past everyone, which was a big benefit.

Then, the moment came. At 10:00, the gun fired, and WE WERE OFF. Immediately as the gun went off, I crossed the start and thought I had started my Garmin, but that didn't quite work, haha. So for the first 200m, I was struggling with my watch but eventually got it sorted. The tempo started quite high, and my target pace was actually to start at 3:55. The tempo I ended up starting off with was 3:50, and to be honest, right away I knew today would be a great day. This tempo felt AMAZING, and I knew I could stick to it. I was nervous because I didn't know if this would be sustainable for 42km, but I really felt good, so I thought, let's freaking go.

The first 10km went by REALLY fast, zooming past roads with thousands of supporters. The starting route in Eindhoven this year was North, which was filled with supporters, and this was so incredibly cool. Within the first 10k, I was still finding my groove and seeing how I felt. But again, keeping that 3:50 pace felt great, and I knew this was the pace I wanted to sustain.

After I hit the 10k mark, I still felt really good, and we were into the next 10k. The part of the race between 10 and 20 actually felt the longest because mentally, I knew there was a long way to go. I started to split up the race into 5k segments as my coach told me, and this really helped break down the race. By 20k, I was still feeling great but didn't dare to start accelerating because, again, there was a long way to go. This was the point where I really started getting comfortable and in the groove.

Between 20 and 30k, there were some segments with really bad headwind (22km/h), but during those segments, I kept my pace and used the tailwinds to recover. This really helped because this was also the point where I started to leave several groups behind. Then we reached 30k, and having fueled properly throughout (1 gel every 6-7km), I still felt strong and knew I had this.

This is also the point where the course started getting a bit lonelier, entering the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven. In previous years, this was the first part of the route, but since it was the 40th edition, they decided to change up the route. This was challenging for many since the 30k point is the dark point for many, but for me, it really was a point to come to solitude and think about how far I had come. All the hours of training, all the sacrifices, led to this day. To the day to beat my PR, and at this 30k point, I knew I was well on my way to beating that 2:45 that I set out to achieve.

I continued chipping off kilometer by kilometer, and by 35k, things started getting more serious. I started entering areas once again where there were supporters, but I knew that I would have to go deep to continue. Still feeling good, the kilometers flew by, and at 38k, my stomach started to turn... I really started getting stomach cramps, and I needed to use the bathroom badly... All the gels were getting to me, and I knew I would just need to HOLD IT for dear life and push through (not in that way). For the next 2 kilometers, I struggled, fighting against those cramps and the need to use the toilet while still hitting good splits. Ultimately, I only ended up hitting faster and faster splits.

At around 39k, a friend of mine was waiting for me and ran almost 2 kilometers with me, hyping up the crowd. This really got me fired up, and I was LOCKED in to PR. I knew there wasn't long left, and this is when I decided to let it RIP. My last 2 kilometers were as follows: 3:35 - 3:34, and the final sprint (195m) was at a 3:28 pace... Crossing the finish line, I knew I had just PR'd by almost 14 minutes, and WOW did I feel amazing. I couldn't quite fathom what I had just done... I only knew that today was a GREAT freaking day.

**After the Race**

Right after the race, I was welcomed by so many people who were supporting and cheering for me. The genuine warmth I received from so many people felt amazing, and it once again proved my passion for running. The fact that my colleague, who I need to give a special thank you to, cycled with me for the entire race and supplied me with gels on course is something I will never forget. The fact that my father traveled by car for 3 hours to come and stay with me to see me finish is something I will never forget. The fact that so many people followed me via the tracking app, from my family in Belgium to one of my best friends who lives in America, means more than the world to me. How did I finish the day? I supported my friends and colleagues and spent the evening with my father having beer, food, more food, and did I mention more food?

**The Day After**

How am I feeling today? Well, last night I actually slept horribly because the adrenaline started wearing off and my body got super stiff. This morning at 5 am, I couldn't sleep anymore, so I decided to go to the gym, stretch, walk, and foam roll. And THAT'S IT. Today, I'm really celebrating this achievement and taking some downtime to let my body rest and recover. Right now, I actually feel a lot better and can genuinely function properly. The mind is more fatigued than the body, but that is to be expected and will likely stay so for the next few days.

However, WHAT A GREAT ADVENTURE, AND ON TO OUR NEXT GOALS!

1g3f59u,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1g3f59u/feel_lost_and_unmotivated/,Feel lost and unmotivated ,"23m, In my 4th year of software development. For the last few years I have felt like I wasted my life pursuing a career that no longer fits who I am. I never really had a massive interest in programming, I mainly just followed the path my friends were taking. As an autistic person, friends are very hard for me to find. I just wasn't born with any great conversational ability. So I tended to latch on to the friends I had. Around the middle of the pandemic, we had a falling out and ended up not talking for a while (although we have since settled our disagreement). But the gap gave me time to reflect and realize that it wasn't what I wanted to do. However, at the time I chose to continue anyway because I was halfway through the program. Despite my stress levels and dislike for the material, I earned my Diploma in June of last year. However, due to a combination of the software development market, and my location, there were virtually no jobs I could be considered for. All avaliable positions required at least a bachelor's degree. Unfortunately, during my time in college, I had started relying on marajuana to help manage my stress. What started as a few joints on the weekend spiraled into spending almost all of my time high post-graduation. I soon got a job at a coffee shop just to have some money coming in, though I couldn't make enough to move out of my parents house. My relationship with them has been friendly, but strained for a while. So in my depressed state, I decided that doing a 4th year overseas would be quickest way out of the house. And, in my mind, would also allow me to work on improving my social skills. However, I failed to consider that I would be continuing in the same field I dislike at an even higher level. And after a month and a half in the program, I'm about ready to quit. The material is uninteresting, the professors do not set clear expectations for assignment requirements, and the workload is extreme. Despite enrolling mostly for the social opportunities, I was told on orientation day that I ""Should not expect to socialize, as your time will be required to complete course work"". This has only served to worsen my depression, and due to the time difference, deprived me of interacting with the friends I already had. I watch as my roommates are able to connect with people and enjoy themselves, but I am stuck working overtime to earn a qualification I have no desire to hold. I have tried explaining this to my parents, but they say that's just life and I need to grow up. The guidance office says that I could leave, but that it would be a major waste of finances, as they can only refund for the 2nd semester. So I am left with the choice to waste my time, or waste my money. I am at a loss for what to do, as I likely will not be able to attend college again for some time. I wanted to be able to make connections with people, and expand my social circle. Something that is very difficult in my hometown. However, If I chose to do that here, it will be at the cost of my grades. This situation has made me very dissolutioned with life, and wondering if I should accept I just can't socialize and give up.

The back story is that i was a complete ahole during the relationship (long distance) because i wasn't good with not seeing him (ik its not an excuse) i act like i didn't care what he felt ect and i broke up with him a couple times during our 2 year relationship, he would always motivate me to keep going and i would.
Once we saw eachother in person during visits everything would be so perfect but because of us being long distance i would want him to be with me all the time, and when he wanted to hang out with his friends i would get very jealous and essentially keeping him away from his friends, which ended up with his friends not really liking me. In feb of this year i broke up with him again because I thought i wanted the college experience (partying, hooking up ect) but the day after i knew that everything was a mistake and that he is my Husband no doubt. I know for a 100% fact that there is no one else for me and matter of fact i dont want anyone else. In these 8 months ive been changing myself to be better not just for him but for myself aswell. I feel like i have accomplished it (being a better person, and understanding what a relationship should be)
I have so much love for this man and i am so utterly committed to making this work. So back to the present: i went to go have a coffee with his mom (we were so close, she told me that i was like the daughter she never had, and i see her as my second mom) she said she wants us to be together again and shes open for that fact, she said she sees such a positive change in me that she feels like me and my ex are meant to be. Fast forward a bit. He randomly called me one night and we talked and laughed for hours, and he asked me if i still wanna have his family name and i obviously said yes and we both laughed and kept talking for a while. After the call we kinda stayed in no contact and we didn't speak up until like a week ago he randomly called me again and we spoke for an hour again. Now we are still not talking and i did try reaching out but he didn't even open the message. In the call we talked about him coming to visit in December and that he was gonna come stay at my house and we could go on dates ect. ( he is very busy he's studying, and he has alot on his plate ik that but i feel like he always made time in the past why cant he now?) so honestly im a bit lost if anyone has any advice or suggestions please lemme know :)

After some hiccups and attempted censorship by anonymous reports to reddit filters last Friday we are SO back this week! We've got some exciting potential catalysts coming up for GME on the horizon, so it'll be important for us to observe our options data closely to try to gain some insight on how the market is betting on GME into the 2nd half of October and our November monthly OPEX cycle. Let's get to it!

**Price Movement Recap**

With our volume under 4mil on Friday, the low-volume scenario I outlined in Friday's post - an upward $0.60-$0.70 move on the day which reversed to Max Pain late in the day by the charm effect did indeed play out, as we can see here:

[10\/11 Trading Day 1-Min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/ysku1xlckpud1.png?width=1297&format=png&auto=webp&s=7424cea332802e34fcc6b1cb09b4b7f21d145697)

Our modest options volume played its part on our upward trend toward the daily high of $21.27 and fueled our intraday spikes above the $21 price level. With the 200-min Moving Average and the Volume-Weighted Average Price essentially overlaying each other for the whole of the day, these levels served as a key support which traders relied upon throughout the day to frame intraday scalps in the upper VWAP channel (range established by +1 Standard Deviation). 

After a full day of trading in this channel, our last spike on the day likely was orchestrated to trap a few short timeframe bulls into the close as Charm bled delta out of the last of the OTM 10/11 Calls, allowing MMs to drop their long share hedges. The price dropped into the close and just below our Max Pain of $21 as MM selling was left unmet. The price nonetheless closed green versus the open. 

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Much of Friday's new OI activity was targeted at our October OPEX. What we can see forming up on this upcoming week of trading is a sizable mixed put/call bracket between $20 and $22 with heavy put skew beneath $20 and call skew above this bracket:

[10\/18 OPEX OI Changes 10\/11-10\/14](https://preview.redd.it/m3cyrdrfmpud1.png?width=1859&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a71ed1bd70956d18b068282f96a1b939bf4bc34)

Our current price position heading into Monday's trading with respect to this bracket suggests a neutral-bullish pattern on the week that does not exceed $22. With Max Pain at $20. we could see a weekly close not too different from our close for 10/11, however, even if we get a bit more extension upward on the price midweek. 

**Gamma Exposure**

Our $20-$22 bracket in the OI data is largely reflected here in our GEX data. $22 forms a familiar Call Wall overhead on our trading with $20 as a decided floor. $20.50-$21.50, though gamma positive and stable strikes, are not nearly as resistant to directional options volume compared to $20 and $22. Thus, if we remain in a low volume environment like what emerged late last week, our trading will remain relegated to intraday see-sawing across this more gamma-neutral range.

Our total daily GEX ratios, at the same time, have been lightly trending back toward a more favorable positive gamma asymmetry from our peak recent negative gamma skew on 10/9. This indicates that, over the past several trading days, aggregate relevant Call GEX has slowly increased versus our Put GEX.  

**Technicals**

[7\/16-9\/19 1-Day Aggregation with Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/oxc9p0cfepud1.png?width=1485&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa725f668835f8c5e3a9cba3fcf8f0b6846f7fe7)

[7\/16-10\/14 1-Day Aggregation Actual](https://preview.redd.it/fwbjasb8ipud1.png?width=1493&format=png&auto=webp&s=595c06996087508d855b57ee358b678d0464e750)

Our actual shape has once again taken the course of the 9/19 doodle projection and now begun its mild recovery path into 10/18 OPEX. Given our return to August levels of daily volume (e.g. Friday volume < 4mil) I am expecting something like the slow upward recovery which materialized in August after the Nikkei Crash. This week thus forecasts likely to be a mix of red and green daily candles that ultimately do not push us past $22 (just above our current 50-day SMA position) before Friday, barring any bullish externalities. 

I'll be putting together a new doodle projection toward the end of this week. The big question will remain: what happens when the 50-day SMA and 200-Day SMA converge in a few weeks' time?

**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/mlnr1xzyrpud1.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=84c91bd5637d92b05e637ff00ee770524dfdee85

As we can see from our restored AlphaQuery chart, implied volatility has been in a flat-downward list since our two week earnings IV thump, imitating at large a pattern of depreciation which materialized over the last two weeks of July and the whole month of August. Friday's intraday IV levels even reached a low not seen since early January of this year (!). This IV depreciation and quietude thus do suggest an opportunity for significant options value appreciation if some sort of externality should be introduced. Otherwise, IV levels do not project to appreciate by much until the two week run up to the December Q3 earnings report at the beginning of the month. 

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

From our current technical and options data layout, this week projects a continued neutral-bullish sentimental orientation with price recovery continuing up to $22, but ultimately closing below this mark. IV levels continue to slump, though should see a small uptick at open today. The question remains what will unfold as we approach National Cat Day and our current technical paradigm expires, as we have been discussing here for weeks now. So far, our price action has continued to unfold in pretty close alignment with projections, though the conclusion of our October Quarterly options window will introduce some significant uncertainty - and new potential - into our trading environment. Let's see what the future brings!

Good luck out there!

Cheers

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.",98,1728909505.0,Superstonk,6,0.94,False

Most replen comes in at 3am with truck due at 330.  I come in at 5am since I can't unload truck but I can get started stocking.

Usually the truck is a *little* late.  Sometimes it shows up around when I get in.

This morning I pull up at 4:40am with plans to enjoy my coffee before walking in.  I notice there's a semi outside the store.  Think to my self it must be a new driver, since they always go to the front.

Then I notice the guy get out of the cab, look at the back of his truck, get back in the cab, barely move forward, then back.  Wash and repeat.  FOR TEN MINUTES!

I had no idea what he was doing.  Then he finally got the truck moved and I saw this big gash on his truck.  Dude hit the fire hydrant!

But he wriggled himself free, starts to go forward, hits the hydrant with his back tire, backs up and...catches the fire hydrant again in the gash now in his truck.

At this point I go in the store, find the manager  and crew in the back by the open Bay door.  I let them know about the truck, and manager and someone else go out to guide the poor trucker.  They finally start unloading at 5:30.

1g3en5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentsInspiration/comments/1g3en5s/surprising_tips_for_students_that_might_change/,Surprising Tips for Students That Might Change the Game,"1. **Use the “Two-Minute Rule” for Quick Wins**: If a task will take two minutes or less (e.g., replying to an email, organizing notes), do it immediately. This prevents small tasks from piling up and clears your mental clutter, allowing you to focus on bigger tasks.
2. **Plan Backward from Due Dates**: Instead of planning tasks from the start date, work backward from the deadline. This gives you a clearer picture of how much time you actually have and helps you prioritize tasks more effectively.
3. **Turn Off Your Wi-Fi While Studying**: When working on assignments that don’t require the internet, turn off your Wi-Fi or put your phone on airplane mode. It’s an easy way to avoid distractions and stay focused.
4. **Learn Keyboard Shortcuts**: Knowing keyboard shortcuts for your most-used programs (Word, Excel, Google Docs) can save you tons of time. For example, CTRL+F to find a word, or ALT+TAB to switch between windows quickly.
5. **Study While Standing Up**: If you’re feeling sleepy while studying, switch to a standing desk or simply stand while reading notes. This boosts your energy and helps prevent that dreaded study slump.
6. **Treat Your Study Sessions Like a Job**: Schedule study sessions as if they’re work shifts. This makes studying feel more like a commitment rather than something you’ll get to “when you have time.”
7. **Create a “Parking Lot” for Off-Topic Thoughts**: When unrelated thoughts pop up while studying, jot them down on a “parking lot” list. This allows you to acknowledge them without getting sidetracked, so you can stay focused on your current task.
8. **Practice the “Closed Book” Method**: After studying a topic, close your book or notes and try to write down everything you remember about it. This will show you where your memory gaps are, so you can focus your next study session on those areas.
9. **Set Up Your Browser with Productivity Extensions**: Use browser extensions like “StayFocusd” to block distracting websites or “Momentum” for daily to-do lists. This helps keep you on task when you’re using the internet.
10. **Have a Weekly Review Session**: Set aside 30 minutes at the end of each week to review what you’ve learned, organize your notes, and plan for the next week. It’s a great way to stay on top of your studies and catch any gaps in your learning.
11. **Utilize Active Recall for Faster Learning**: Instead of passively reading, actively quiz yourself on the material. Ask questions like “What are the main points of this chapter?” and try to recall them from memory.
12. **Drink Water Instead of Coffee During Study Breaks**: Hydration is key for concentration and energy. If you’re in the habit of reaching for coffee, try switching to water occasionally to avoid the caffeine crash.
13. **Practice “Batching” for Similar Tasks**: If you have multiple similar tasks (like reading assignments or writing essays), group them together and complete them back-to-back. This minimizes the time lost switching between different types of tasks.
14. **Study in Short, Frequent Sessions for Better Retention**: Instead of cramming for hours, study in short bursts of 25-30 minutes with 5-minute breaks in between (Pomodoro Technique). Your brain retains information better this way.
15. **Follow the “One-Touch Rule” for Digital Files**: When organizing files on your computer, only “touch” them once. If you download a document, immediately move it to the appropriate folder instead of leaving it on the desktop.",1,1728909252.0,StudentsInspiration,0,1.0,False

","My wife and I switch off cooking, both of us cook twice a week and the days neither of us cook it’s a leftover night or takeout. We used to have the person that didn’t cook do the dishes after the meals. I clean as a cook, so when it is my night there are very few dishes for her to clean up. When she cooks, I swear she uses almost every single dish or pot for her meals. It is a disaster in the kitchen and takes me a long time to clean the whole thing up.

I have had conversations before about this and have asked her to clean as she goes to reduce then mess. She refuses and claims that is just what happens because she likes to make elaborate meals. She does make more elaborate meals than me and spends a while in the kitchen. I prefer to make more simples meals like stir fry. 

I brought up last thursday that I won’t clean up after her cooking anymore. She left a huge mess and I was over it. That I will clean up my dinners and she can clean up hers.

On Saturday ( my cooking night) I made beef tips over noddles and cleaned it all up.Sunday was her cooking night and she made homemade pasta and red pepper sauce. We ate and she didn’t clean up her mess, and later the night she asked me to clean it up I told her no and reminded her what I told her and pointed out I cleaned my stuff up.

This bring me to this morning, I didn’t do the dishes and when she woke up, there wasn’t much room for her to make her coffee and breakfast. She pissed I didn’t clean it up. We got in a huge argument before I left for work

Here are some things guests loved that I honestly was worried about wasting money on but they were worth the money and some things that weren’t noticed!



• Not worth the money: 


• Our signature drink - We ordered so much margarita mix and no one drank our signature drink! They just got wine, beer, or if they ordered liquor they just got vodka sodas. 


• Fancy dessert - those who ate the dessert loved it but I’d say that was 20% of my guests. Most guests skipped it and I had a ton of leftovers. 


• QR code digital photo album and sign - I’d say about 10 out of my 110 guests were actually using this. 
• Fancy Florals: While I loved my centerpieces and they were beautiful it didn’t really add anything to the experience and the bud vases I added myself to add more to the space were much cheaper and still beautiful. I could have done all that with candles and saved a lot. 



• Worth the money:


• Coffee Cart: I was so worried this would be a waste of money and no one would use it but everyone was obsessed with our coffee cart. I’m still getting compliments about how good of an idea that was and my guests loved the signature flavors and options. It gave them the energy to go all night and my non drinkers fun drinks to have. 


• Photobooth: Get the photobooth and unlimited prints. Put it by the dance floor. Ours was right between the bar and dance floor and it was packed all night. The digital album and prints were so fun and everyone keeps posting all of their pictures. 


• Custom matchboxes: I definitely thought this was a waste of money but I put bowls of them on cocktail tables and I got endless compliments on them all night, so many people took them, and posted pictures of them after the wedding as well!


• A good DJ: Our DJ kept the night flowing so smoothly and kept the dance floor packed all night! 


• Late Night Snack: I was on the fence about getting a late night snack but we got a bunch of pizzas delivered an hour before the reception ended and people loved it. It wasn’t too expensive either!

The grossness of observing my nex’s mirroring all summer and just now realizing my nex wasn’t and isn’t trying to be better with habits, etc. he’s just mirroring the supply. The new guy had a healthy bedtime routine that my nex knew he would have to adopt to remain within his good graces. He may have even told the guy that he was already an early bed guy. So they appeared more ‘compatible’. 

Nothing about him is genuine. As I said before, he’s a vagrant just moving from one host to another, so why shouldn’t he pretend to like or do the things the new guy wants. 

I’m glad it wasn’t me who couldn’t inspire him to be better. He didn’t need to change for me because he already had me. Why bother?

The earliest thing about mirroring I’ve seen is him drinking tea in the morning. ‘Jim never has a 2nd cup of coffee at home.’ He mirrored his boyfriend for a morning drink (nex doesn’t like coffee) and sent me pics and posted on Insta the cute breakfast setup. All the time. 

Worse demeaning act all summer was when I knew the nex would bounce back to me one Thursday night and I said I’d make dinner…scrapple and eggs. Mid-day he sends me a picture of his plate for lunch…scrapple and eggs, made by the new man. I can guarantee it was by his request that his boyfriend made it for him and that he wanted to be able to torture me with that picture. Ugh.
