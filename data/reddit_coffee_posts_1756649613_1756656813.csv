She politely turned me down, nothing dramatic, just one of those moments you carry with you. Life went on, we lost touch, and I didn‚Äôt think much about it again.

Recently, she reached out. She told me she‚Äôs always respected me, that she remembers how kind I was back then, and that she‚Äôd like to meet for coffee sometime. On the surface it sounds flattering, but I can‚Äôt help feeling conflicted.

It‚Äôs been over a decade. I spent those years building a life, working on myself, staying consistent. Meanwhile, she had her own path (relationships, experiences, choices that obviously didn‚Äôt involve me). She‚Äôs now a single mother of two. And that‚Äôs fine. But why now? Why reach out after so long?

Part of me wonders if she‚Äôs suddenly seeing me differently because her circumstances have changed, not because I‚Äôve become more attractive to her as a person. Am I actually what she wants, or just what‚Äôs convenient at this stage?

I know people evolve, and maybe she genuinely does see me in a new light. Still, there‚Äôs a nagging feeling that if I wasn‚Äôt good enough back then, why should I be the backup plan now?",2,1756656617.0,AskMenAdvice,3,1.0,False

1n4ynp8,https://v.redd.it/d6r5o4nepdmf1,Finished. Flawless. A 90-hour masterpiece.,"I finished Abiotic Factor after 90 hours, on hard, and about six weeks of play, or whenever 1.0 released on PS5. Here are some shots from my final base. What an experience. It‚Äôs now up there with my favourite survival games of all time: Subnautica, Grounded, Mines of Moria (more of a recent one), Terraria. I‚Äôve generally tried to steer away from this subreddit because of spoilers, but here are a few of my thoughts, thought settle in, it‚Äôs gotten long.

Surprisingly, the game reminded me a lot of Pacific Drive, not because the gameplay is similar but because the base vibes ‚Äî one is a driving survival game set in the Pacific Northwest where, after a run, you get to shut the garage door behind you and tinker on your vehicle, rain lashing against your door, while in Abiotic, you‚Äôre in the research laboratory and, again, get to shut the door behind you and tinker while the world outside is scary. 

I struggled to move beyond the cafeteria: the travel options were just too good, particularly when you throw in the recall cart near Warren‚Äôs station in the Lobby. I was tempted to move to the Hydroplant at one point, then the big mansion near the reactors with a glowing mushroom backdrop, sort of the snowy research station on Voussoir. I expected to see some bases on the train, but couldn‚Äôt see anything specific. Ultimately, though, there‚Äôs just something extremely satisfying about being in the cafeteria‚Äôs security room, with its fluorescent lights, fridge, TV, blue linoleum floors with green trim on the walls. 

At first, I used paintings to block out the windows and flashing orange emergency lights, and filled it with sconce lamps (from the train), to ward off the nasties creeping about in the night. Eventually, I branched out. First into the kitchen, and later, across the whole cafeteria, collecting as much furniture as possible, warding off spawns with various trinkets. 

Being able to slowly erase the signs of panic is one of my favourite aspects of base building. As soon as possible, carpets were placed carefully over dropped research papers, shelves in front of warning lights, hazard signs in front of bodies. Eventually, the base felt somewhat cosy, with shock traps lining the front door and laser turrets keeping enemies at bay. Did my best to block certain doors, like behind the kitchen, to keep out enemies, and I‚Äôd love a feature that allows you to paint over the flashing orange lights. 

With the difficulty on hard, it took me around 90 hours to complete the game, which, oh boy, felt like an undertaking. To its credit, the final boss required just enough preparation to be a bit of a challenge, and anything more would have made the game feel like it had overstayed its welcome, though I look forward to DLC. 

Generally, as a reader, I mostly couldn‚Äôt be bothered to read all of the emails, but in essence I‚Äôm interested in the lore. Was there much I missed here? 

Give me more bobble heads, pet pictures, furniture, arcade machines ‚Äî the works. 

With multiplayer, I had originally wanted to play with friends, but almost immediately realised that they wouldn‚Äôt have the staying power or focus to play the game. So grindy at times, even with a meticulous mentality of collecting stuff, you still run out of the things you need. There‚Äôs no way my friends would be able to put in the time and focus required for it, which is a shame, but c‚Äôest la vie. 

‚ÄòLeyak: ‚Ä¶‚Äô. That fucking thing is a work of brilliance, with its floppy, penis vacuum arms and googly, triple-threat eyes. My god. When you hear its shy, little moans and it‚Äôs just there, in the doorway, or even when it‚Äôs far off in the distance, floating, it‚Äôs so, god damned, unsettling. And, in a way, it‚Äôs a bit like a companion. Finally having it trapped in the Containment Unit is a blessing and a curse, like an alien Tamagotichi that needs constant feeding. One of the few things I‚Äôm tempted to do post game is capture his brother, Karuse, as my second unit is currently empty. Coworker, alike, is just genius: ‚ÄúI love coffee in my coffee hole.‚Äù When he wriggles away in the morning, it‚Äôs like something out of a horror movie. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs a bit more to his story. 

There are a couple of things I‚Äôm still a little stumped on. Where is this green field location where some people seem to have bases, above ground? And a similar question but a traditional, Japanese house. 

Also, what‚Äôs the plan for the game from here on out? Is there more coming?

1n4yk1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1n4yk1m/i_feel_like_im_losing_my_mind/,I feel like I'm losing my mind...,"I've been meaning to post this for a long time, but I've never been able to get myself to do it until now. So here it goes:

I feel like I'm losing my mind (I'll get to that in a bit). For context, I'm a 23 year old male currently living in California. I was born and raised in the middle east, parents got divorced in 2012, my mother, brother (2 years younger than me), and I moved to 2 different countries over 3 years to seek immigration support from the U.N. until 2017 when they gave us the green light to migrate to the U.S.

Ever since my parents' divorce, I've had to step up and be an adult. As a single parent, my mom was going through a lot. She had to support two kids in a foreign country while barely speaking the language. As a result, she needed someone to talk to and someone to listen to her problems. That was me. She would tell me everything and all that was going on. I love my mom and I would do the same 100 times over if I were to go back, but I think this was the beginning of a lot of my mental problems.

When we moved to the U.S. in 2017, I was the only one who spoke English in our family. So naturally everything fell on my shoulders in terms of supporting the family. I had to help my mom by translating government documents, meeting with immigration lawyers, signing up for credit cards and loans, applying for jobs for her, and more. I had to do all this while jumping right into the US high school system as a junior and having to stay 2 hours longer per day to catch up my freshman and sophomore years since they didn't count my foreign school credits.

I barely made any friends in high school. It was just not possible with all the stress and workload. Before I knew it, towards the end of my senior year in 2019, I was able to secure a job as a barista, which I immediately became a full-time worker at the moment I graduated. I also started going to community college right after graduation.

Since 2019, I have been working full time (sometimes 50-60 hours per week) and going to school full time. I moved out with my current girlfriend in 2020 and in 2022 I transferred to a very good university in Southern California to finish my Bachelor's. From 2022 until May 2025, I was going to school during the day, and then going to work overnight from 6 PM to 6 AM. I was staying out for 2-3 days at a time, sleeping 3-4 hours at a time in my car, showering at a gym, and drinking energy drinks and cheap sandwiches for breakfast and lunch.

I graduated in May 2025 and am still trying to find a job in my industry. But I no longer have the extra workload of school. I work 7 AM to 4 PM now at a decent company and the downside is that I'm not doing what I went to school for, I have no PTO or holidays, and the pay is $25 per hour which pretty much amounts to nothing in Southern California.

Now here is why I think I'm losing my mind: having fun or relaxing feels wrong and makes me feel like I'm a disappointment. I have trouble making decisions. Not even big decisions, even small ones like what to eat for dinner or if I want my coffee the same way as the day before. I spend so much time trying to make a decision sometimes that it's making my girlfriend very frustrated (rightfully so). My mood changes so often throughout the day that I could wake up and feel energized and motivated to do so many things but then in an hour I feel like I want to off myself. Then after lunch, I go back to feeling like everything is fine and life's going great. This last one is what is making me doubt my sanity.

My girlfriend is extremely supportive and she's put up with my BS for a long time. But despite that, I feel like I don't have anybody to talk to because I don't think anybody understands me. I have tried talking to my mom and my brother about these, but over the past few years they have been blaming me for moving out and transferring to a college far away. I've brought up issues like ""I'm feeling down because 80% of my paycheck goes to rent and bills"" and the response I get is ""you should budget better"". I feel like my family is very dismissive of my .

I'm mentally exhausted. I feel like my childhood was taken away from me, and now as an adult, I'm too mentally unstable to enjoy my adulthood and have a normal life. I feel like I've done so much already and I'm just ready to retire so I can sit on the front porch and drink whiskey until I die. Sometimes I even fantasize about having cancer so I would know I have an expiration date and maybe that would snap me  out of this mess and make me enjoy life for a few years before I die. I know it's horrible to think that, so I'm sorry if I've upset any of you.

I'm thinking about going to therapy and getting some help, but I'm broke and have no insurance, so that'll have to wait a bit. But until then, what do I do? How do I go about this?",1,1756656282.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

The Kit was gone.

It had been entrusted to James, and he had taken it. Inside the Kit was 10,000 dollars.  And pills. That was why he had taken it, E was sure of it. But there was more in the Kit. There were letters. And pictures of ‚Äòcilla.

Red get the boys and fan out, James took the Kit. There‚Äôs a car missing. The Lincoln.  He‚Äôll be headed for the airport.

Red spoke into a phone on the wall, then hung it up.

The boys are in town, I‚Äôll get ‚Äòem E, we‚Äôll meet you there.

I‚Äôll meet you at the airport Red.

Beside the door a string of keys. Red grabbed the nearest set, the ones with dice on. them. The door slammed after him.  Slapping leather on concrete then the fire of combustion,
cold gasoline vaporized inside eight cylinders and the squeal of tires.

Big E donned a cape. A revolver, a police special, rested in a specially sewed pocket of
his jumpsuit.

His sunglasses darkened the mid July sun of Tennessee. He had chosen the keys to a
Cadillac, and the ignition turned. The transmission in gear the pedal on the floor. Loose gravel
danced behind him, kicked into a window of the house, a mohawk of rock and dirt and anger
and dinosaur bones.

It would take time for Red to get to town, and the boys. He knew a back road, a ring road around town. Bootlegger route from Prohibition. 

James would go that way.

The hardball highway under his wheels. He flashed his lights, and waved a federal badge at cars ahead of him and they pulled over. Several miles ahead a dirt road to the right.

He took it, fishtailing the Cadillac, turned into the skid, gunned the motor.

The road climbed a gentle hill, broadleaf hardwoods swayed in the wake of American horsepower. Ahead the road turkey tracked, a sharp turn to the left and a gentle grade to the
right. The center, a two track path, kudzu crushed by recent tire tracks. He stopped the car.
The tire tracks matched the tread pattern of the Lincoln. 

He pursued.

The suspension rocked and the low slung frame of the Cadillac dragged against baked puddle edges and his speed was reduced by necessity, drag marks ahead were fresh. His
confidence grew with his rage.

Another mile and glint in the forest, then a clearing. An ancient farmhouse. 

Overgrown by kudzu and broken vehicles and barrels and gutted furniture and rusted tools. 

Beside the house, the Lincoln.

He pulled behind it, parking to box in and deny escape. 

Revolver in hand he ripped from the drivers seat.

James! James! Get over here!

There was no sound but the clicking of the hot engine.

He scanned, no movement. He kicked open the farmhouse door. 

Pack rats and possums had left their smell and their detritus, but the house held no higher life. His white cowboy boots thud on a molded Persian rug. A hollow sound beneath. He moved the rug. 

A trap door. 

He opened it. A stairwell into darkness.  He examined the stairs.  Fresh prints.

Tony Llamas.

James.

He possessed no external light source, but a cigarette lighter, and he fashioned a torch out of packrat sticks and shredded rags.

James, I‚Äôm coming after you man, and if you don‚Äôt come out now I‚Äôm going to hurt you,
bad.

He descended the stairs. 

Ancient timbers supported the hand hewn tunnel descending
at a 45 degree angle. The stairs were wooden, rotten, some creaked, some were broken in
times past, some broken recently, some broke under his boot. He fed more strips of cloth to the torch. No markings on the wall, save for pick ruts and chisel marks in the harder rock.

The stairs switchbacked and the air grew warm. His sideburns fluttered with a breeze in his face that smelled of pancakes and maple syrup. Far ahead a light glowed, narrow from distance, blue hued. He drew the revolver and approached carefully, not for concern of ambush, but for concern of the fragile stairs.

James! Last warning man. There‚Äôs still time to smooth this out!

The blue light ahead darkened, then reappeared.

If this is about the money, you could just ask, man!

The tunnel turned. Mushrooms on the ceiling of a small room. A body in the center. Not James‚Äô somebody else, an ancient body with rotting denim overalls shrouding mushroom cracked bones. Beside the body lay a sword. He examined it. The scabbard was wood, ornate, black and gold etchings. The steel shined blue, and was free of rust.

Karate sword, he knew. 

The curve of the blade and the hardness of the steel, Damascus. 

A dragon etched into the blade.
‚ÄúTerminus Est,‚Äù written on the handle. 

He felt power when he gripped the handle. Hungry power.

A silk strap was affixed to both ends of the scabbard, and he placed it over his shoulder,
moving his cape for ease of access.

Down the tunnel shuffling, a muffled scrape and strained creaks of tested wood.

James! I made it this far, and I‚Äôm still willing to forget all this man.

There was no answer.

He fed a strip of the dead man‚Äôs overalls to the torch, and waited
The sound stopped several paces away, still shrouded in darkness. He waited, pistol
trained at the opening of the tunnel. 

Then a being leapt into the room. Muscles covered by thick fur, adorned with belts of human skulls. The beast stood high, a head or two taller than him, and peered down with a head covered in dirty fur, a snout protruding, two yellowed teeth at
the front, each as big as a man‚Äôs thumb, it held a crude club, rebar with a cinder block on the
end.

E stood still, not from fear, he was Army trained, and an accomplished Karateman. It
was the oddity of the thing before him. A creature not of this world, from before the time God
banished Behemoth and Leviathan. A remanent of a past world full of sin and evil and
savagery. The giant creature readied its improvised club, and he shot it with the police special.

Two rounds of .357 tore through the chest of the creature, ripped coffee can sized holes through
the back. The creature stumbled, then fell backwards. 

He examined the body. The fur was fine, thick, like that on a dog‚Äôs face. There were eyes, but they were mere slits, tiny ears sat upon the thing‚Äôs head. The snout was also like a dog‚Äôs, extended several inches, the two large front teeth gave way to rows of small ones, separated by a rough gray tongue.

The body was like that of a man‚Äôs. But the claws. Five on each finger, six inches or
longer. 

He touched one, it was hard, chipped, caked in dirt. He counted the skulls around the
thing‚Äôs waist, seven, some large, but two were small, children‚Äôs size.

Mole men, just like in the movies, Lord Jesus.

He calculated his options. He had four rounds left in the revolver, and he knew his torch
wouldn‚Äôt last the ascent. He would be trapped if he stayed in this place or continued. 

But James had the Kit. And he needed it back.

He gathered what was left of the tattered overalls, added them to the torch, and walked the tunnel of the beast‚Äôs origin.

More wooden steps. Five of them. Then nothing.

He stepped into air and fell, tumbling through warm darkness. 

He fell faster than the torch and its light danced into his view every few seconds as he spun head over boots in the
darkness. Then the torch unraveled and there was no light. Only wind and blackness. 

He began to panic, but summoned an inner calm. He reached one corner of his rhinestone cape, and then another, and held it out like a wing. The increased drag stabilized his fall, Army training took over, and positioned his feet below him like a paratrooper.

He glided untold minutes. Meditation controlled his mind, and the fear of the darkness
was pushed down, replaced with a calm readiness. 

More untold minutes and a glow appeared below him. Orange and yellow and warm.

He glided toward the light. A cloudbank, or fog, he wasn‚Äôt sure. His cowboy boots
pierced the cloudbank and he was buffeted by turbulence, condensation on his sideburns and eyebrows. 

More descent. And the light grew brighter.

Soon he was through the cloud bank. Below him a vast and green landscape. A box canyon covered in clouds, dazzlingly bright mushrooms lining the sides. Foliage below, and a
massive tower, cobblestone square. Houses.

Holy moley, I found the center of the Earth, man.

The updrafts were strong, and harnessed them to slow him and to gently land. He did so, in the square.

He was in a village. The stone tower stood 300 feet tall, a stone snake constricted its way around the vertical length of it over and over from the bottom to the top. 

Huts of mud and thatched roofs surrounded the square, some larger buildings were made of stone and unknown timber, and large white material.

Bone. Behemoth‚Äôs bones built these buildings.

WHO DARE ENTER MY KINGDOM?

A voice from everywhere echoed in his ears. The sound shook his teeth and vibrated his sideburns.

He looked around. There was no one speaking. Inside the nearest hut he saw something peak out at him. A creature, small, timid looking.

I SAID WHO DARE ENTER!? FLYING SKY MAN! SPEAK! I AM THE WIZARD BRANCH HEMLOCK, HEWER OF TREES AND MEN, SLAYER OF THE THE CRIMINAL GADIANTON, CAMBRIAN OF THE EARTH, AND KING OF THIS REALM AND I DEMAND YOU SPEAK OR SUFFER YOUR VERY DEATH!

Whoa man, I‚Äôm a bit of a King myself.

YOU DARE TO CHALLENGE MY POWER!?

From the top of the tower, a man jumped and fell at fast speed toward him. 

The man landed gently 20 or so paces from him, he felt the breeze of his wake buffet him.
The man was old, long hair, a white beard past his chest. Black adorned robe covered a
skinny frame, a tall pointy hat similarly adorned with moons and stars atop his head. He carried a sword and spoke in a rasp. 

A wizard. A wizard king.

A king? A king has come to challenge me for my kingdom? I see.

No business here but my own. I came looking for my man, he took something from me,
and I‚Äôm going to take it back.

The wizard king squinted, then turned and spoke words unpronounceable in a human
mouth. A dozen mole men emerged from the stone building, all crisscrossed with human skulls and other grisly accouterments. 

They drug a mangled body behind them.

James.

So, So Called King, is this your man?

My man was alive when he fled, and though he did me wrong, he‚Äôs still my own. I had no quarrel with you man, but now I do.

SO BE IT!

The mole men dropped James‚Äô body and charged. He knew the revolver was of no use, so he left it in his jumpsuit. The karate sword unsheathed, he drew a defensive combat stance.

The creatures balked their charge.

WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

I found it, man.

BLASPHEMY!

The wizard king stepped into the sky, non-Euclidean geometries of lights dancing from his
fingers, arcing toward him, fire and death and heat and hate and off key music followed. 

He executed a karate roll and missed the first salvo, then another. A third struck close, and a fourth was a direct hit, but the light and the heat was absorbed into the sword. 

He felt a power surge through him, transmitted from the wizard king  to the light to the sword to him. 

He took a step and felt the ground soften. He looked down and he was floating. He took another step and gained
elevation.

Below him, hundreds more mole men emerged from huts and buildings and nearby forests and fields, and sank to one knee as they watched the duel of kings.

The wizard flung more light and fireballs at him, and he absorbed them with the blade, power surging through him.

IT CAN‚ÄôT BE! NOT LIKE THIS!

He closed to within a dozen paces of the man in the sky, drew the police special, and
fired four rounds into the wizard king‚Äôs head. The man fell to the ground, dead.

He descended to the corpse, and touched the blade to the man‚Äôs body. Unimaginable
power gripped him as the blade drew the magic. Memories that were not his flooded his mind,
and knowledge of 10,000 years of forgotten secrets.

He stepped into the sky, sword held above him. The molemen fell to both knees and let out an unworldly sound. 

A sound of rejoice.

First of all, ADHD isn't much of a ""thing"" in my country. I mean, yes, but it's very stereotyped to ""bouncy little boy who can't sit still"". Many therapists here are of the old school sort so getting a diagnosis is borderline impossible sometimes. And if you do find a good one, it's extremely expensive (we're talking about 500usd for an eval, when the average salary is less than 1000usd). 

Recently, I was recommended someone by a psychiatrist. I specifically asked for a therapist familiarized with attention deficit. This man not only proceeded to ""diagnose"" me in the first fifteen minutes with a generalized anxiety disorder, but told me: adults can't have adhd, it is impossible that I have adhd because I am a lawyer (apparently, people with adhd can't have degrees), why can't I just ""go and do stuff"" (when telling him about my executive disfunction), I can't have adhd because coffee makes me sleepy and not focused ?????. And this are SOME of the things I remember. Not only that, but he berated me and told me that I don't know what adhd is and that I obviously have anxiety so just acept it ???

The most disheartening thing about this is that this man is not just an idiot/misinformed - it reflects how people in my country view adhd and how I might never get the tools to help me. It makes me want to cry. I feel this is especially difficult as a woman because I am not hyperactive, but of the inattentive type and high functioning on top of that. I'm just tired from being constantly exhausted because my brain is my biggest enemy.

Yeah‚Ä¶ same.

Most of us blame stress, bad pillows, or ‚Äújust getting older.‚Äù But here‚Äôs the twist I didn‚Äôt expect: **it might not be your sleep at all ‚Äî it might be your blood sugar.**

Here‚Äôs what I learned:  
When your blood sugar dips too low at night, your body freaks out. It releases stress hormones (like cortisol) to bring it back up. Translation? Your body‚Äôs ‚Äúrest‚Äù time is actually ‚Äúmini-emergency‚Äù time. You wake up technically rested but feel like you ran a marathon in your sleep.

That‚Äôs why you can clock 7‚Äì9 hours and still feel drained, foggy, and irritable in the morning.

Crazy part? Stabilizing your blood sugar before bed (through food or certain [supplements](https://glucotrustfr.co/decouverte/#aff=Piquify)) can change how *restorative* your sleep actually feels. Like‚Ä¶ you finally wake up feeling refreshed instead of wrecked.

‚ÄúSo now I‚Äôve gotta ask‚Ä¶ if you wake up tired, do you blame the coffee, the stress, or do you secretly think something else is going on?

1n4y7vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyEffectivePrayer/comments/1n4y7vv/5_daily_effective_prayers_to_pray_for_yourself/,5 Daily Effective Prayers To Pray For Yourself Every Day,"I distinctly remember one morning when I burned my toast, spilled coffee on my shirt, and realized I‚Äôd forgotten to pay a bill that was already overdue. That‚Äôs when I caught myself muttering, *‚ÄúLord, I can‚Äôt even hold it together before 9 a.m.‚Äù* I didn‚Äôt plan some grand prayer‚ÄîI just blurted it out. And oddly enough, that messy, half-formed prayer carried me farther than the polished ones I sometimes rehearse.

Prayer isn‚Äôt supposed to sound perfect. It‚Äôs supposed to be real. These are five daily prayers I‚Äôve found myself circling back to again and again. They‚Äôre not magic words. They‚Äôre simple ways to talk to God about the stuff we all face.

# 1. Prayer For Adoration When You Feel Small

Sometimes I get so wrapped up in myself‚Äîmy plans, my worries‚Äîthat I forget who‚Äôs actually running the show. A few weeks ago I sat in my truck, hands on the steering wheel, just whispering, *‚ÄúGod, You‚Äôre bigger than this.‚Äù* That was enough. It shifted me from panic to perspective.

**Prayer:**  
*‚ÄúLord, I don‚Äôt need to tell You how to fix things right now. I just need to remember who You are. You‚Äôre steady, holy, good. I worship You in this moment. Amen.‚Äù*

# 2. Prayer For Strength When You‚Äôre Running on Empty

I‚Äôve had nights where I stared at the ceiling, worrying about tomorrow, knowing I‚Äôd have to show up exhausted. Once, after a week of late nights and too much stress, I prayed while brushing my teeth: *‚ÄúGod, You‚Äôve got to be the strength I don‚Äôt have.‚Äù* It wasn‚Äôt eloquent, but it got me through that meeting the next morning without collapsing.

**Prayer:**  
*‚ÄúFather, I‚Äôm worn down and I don‚Äôt have what it takes. Please carry me today. Fill the cracks with Your strength where mine runs out. Amen.‚Äù*

# 3. Wisdom Prayer When Life Doesn‚Äôt Come with Instructions

Parenting, money, relationships‚Äînobody hands you a manual. I once bought a used desk from Craigslist and had to guess how the pieces fit together. That‚Äôs how life feels most days. In one of those seasons, I started praying, *‚ÄúGod, help me see the next right thing.‚Äù* Not five steps ahead. Just one.

**Prayer:**  
*‚ÄúLord, I don‚Äôt want to stumble around blind. Give me wisdom for the choice right in front of me. Make it clear enough so I can take it. Amen.‚Äù*

# 4. Gratitude Prayer When Cynicism Creeps In

Last month, in the middle of paying bills, I suddenly noticed the light slanting across my kitchen counter. It stopped me. I just said, *‚ÄúThank You, God, for that.‚Äù* Gratitude doesn‚Äôt erase problems, but it cuts cynicism off at the knees.

**Prayer:**  
*‚ÄúDear God, even with all the chaos, I see Your gifts around me. Thank You for the little things I usually overlook. Thank You for today. Amen.‚Äù*

# 5. Prayer To Surrender When You‚Äôre Gripping Too Tight

I‚Äôm good at clinging. Grudges, plans, even grocery lists‚ÄîI grip them like they‚Äôre life rafts. But once, after a hard argument with someone close to me, I ended up on the couch saying, *‚ÄúGod, I can‚Äôt fix this. I‚Äôm handing it over.‚Äù* The peace didn‚Äôt come instantly, but the knot in my chest loosened.

**Prayer:**  
*‚ÄúFather, here‚Äôs the truth: I can‚Äôt control this. I hand it over to You. Take it from my tight fists and hold it in Yours. Amen.‚Äù*

# Closing Thought

These aren‚Äôt five neat boxes to check. Some days you‚Äôll pray all of them. Other days, only one. And honestly, there‚Äôll be days you barely squeak out three words: *‚ÄúHelp me, God.‚Äù* That counts too (trust me).

So tomorrow, before your day spins out, why not pick one and pray it? Not polished. Not fancy. Just you, talking to Him. That‚Äôs where the real power is.

Now, grinding as fine as possible ie burrs just barely chirping then backing off a hair, I‚Äôm getting 50 g or more in 20 s or less. Deep cleaned the grinder yesterday, made no difference. (Burrs weren‚Äôt significantly caked up)

I thought maybe I was going too fine and maybe the puck was just fracturing and channeling early so I backed off and it flowed just that much faster.

I‚Äôve had this setup for a couple years and coffee has been good so I like to think I‚Äôve got the hang of this‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm stumped. TIA for any help!",2,1756654970.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

1n4xwvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1n4xwvm/weird_symptoms_from_increased_vitamin_and_mineral/,Weird symptoms from Increased vitamin and mineral requirement after peating?,"I started Peating around 1 year ago and have noticed really good effects, my depression is pretty much fixed, I look better and I have lost weight. I am on t3 monotherapy (25mcg) However, since 4 months ago, I started having weird symptoms, first my left eye had an increase in floaters and felt heavy and dry. Then, my skin got really dry and I had more water retention in my face and acne as well. I also started to experience fatigue, low motivation and very intense brainfog (dissociative). I tried searching for solutions but didn‚Äôt know why this was happening to me (thought that it was pollution/allergens because I had just moved countries) 

Around 2 months ago I started to eat liver more regularly, around 250g per week and I noticed an improvement in symptoms. My symptoms always got worse right before Monday which is the day I would eat liver. Now I have to eat around 300g of liver per week or else my symptoms will return. I also started using B1 which has helped with the symptoms as well. I wonder if my symptoms were due to a lack of vitamin A or just a lack of B vitamins or something else. Its really weird how I have to eat a large amount of liver or else the symptoms return fast. Right now I feel good and have returned to normal but it took me 3 months to find a solution. Has anyone had a similar problem to me and could anyone explain how or why this happened to me?

When the symptoms started happening, I also noticed a decrease in the effectiveness of other pro metabolic ‚Äùremedies‚Äù: coffee had a weaker effect and made me tiered or anxious, aspirin stopped working, sunlight didn‚Äôt make me as euphoric as it used to, I was more sensitive to foods (brainfog and fatigue from certain foods)",1,1756654729.0,raypeat,2,1.0,False

The sun was barely peaking over the horizon when it began to heat the air. The sound of cicadas was blaring. Fog covered the Everglade marshlands like a heavy curtain. The cabin windows were covered in morning dew, and a breeze blew through the dangling wind chime. Small waves caused by passing boats‚Äîmade the tied-up Jon boat wobble. Frogs were croaking, flies were buzzing, and birds were chirping. The rusty, old hinges let out a low scream as the cabin door opened. A boy in his late teens(18), stepped through.

‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù Dan yelled, almost slipping on the wet moss(growing on the deck). He caught himself, hand firmly grabbing on the porch railing. He reattained his footing and stood. Pausing, he waited patiently for the sounds of his mother waking up‚ÄîNothing but silence. ‚ÄúThank God,‚Äù he sighed, quietly knocking the moss off his leather boots. Now, making way towards the water‚Äôs edge, fishing pole in hand and kicking up sand, he rummaged through his pants pocket. Searching for his bait jar‚Äîgot it! He pulled it out and paused; a distant, familiar voice in the back of his mind, came to the front, ‚ÄúNight crawlers are the best, son. But you gotta keep uh sharp eye out for‚Äòem. You hear me, my boy?‚Äù

‚ÄúYe‚Äî‚Äù little Danny was interrupted.

‚ÄúShit,‚Äù Dan muttered as he slapped his neck‚Äîsplattering blood. He raised his hand, saw a squirt of blood, and then his neck had a light itch. ‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs catch me some breakfast,‚Äù He uttered to himself, a light breeze brushed his dark brown hair. He wiped his hand off on his pants(leaving a red stain), unscrewed the jar, pinched his fingers around one of the squirming worms(trying not to crush it), and hooked it. Whoosh! The line went as it flew‚Äîsplash! Dan closed his eyes and took a deep breath. His mind went to a different time. 

‚ÄúOkay now, put the pole over your right shoulder,‚Äù his dad instructed, giving a visual aid. ‚ÄúLike this. Now, you‚Äôre gonna sling it forward, and let your finger release the line.‚Äù His father demonstrated. 

Little Danny closed his eyes; his mind focused on his father‚Äôs words. He got ready‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶opened them. He was back in the present with the calm water glistening as the sun rose higher, thick algae littering the bank, and along with it‚Äî something desiring to be found.

Bethany, Dan‚Äôs ten-year-old sister, began to stir on her uncomfortable, sweaty mattress. As the sun got higher and hotter, so did the house; the cabin would become like an oven at noon, but right now, it was only preheating. She stretched and winced. Her wet clothes and blond hair clung to her. Humidity sucks, she thought. Quickly, she got out of bed and wiped away the sweat from her forehead. Her vision was blurred, and her head was foggy. She paused a moment to listen to the sound of her mother, Marie, moving about the kitchen. Breakfast? Wendy reached for a rag and dipped it into a fresh pail of water, which she kept next to her bed. She wiped away the nasty, sticky sweat‚Äîfeeling refreshed. And now more awake, she picked up her glasses from her rustic dresser and went to join her mother. Whom was now enjoying her beloved time of the day‚Äîdrinking her morning coffee(black). Her door opened, and her mother was sitting at the kitchen table and taking a sip. 

‚ÄúBeth,‚Äù her mother said, sounding lightly groggy. ‚ÄúI need you to grab the eggs out of the coop, please.‚Äù She took another sip of her coffee. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get breakfast started when you get back.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes Mama,‚Äù Beth responded, promptly. The door hinges let out another low screech, and then a slam.

Her mother recoiled, her morning coffee disturbed.

Now digging through the almost dilapidated chicken coop, trying to avoid touching chicken shit, Beth could catch a glimpse of her brother, who was casting and recasting with an irritated way about it. With every cast, there was another grunt out of him. He only does that when they ain‚Äôt biting, she thought, and then giggled. Still amused by her brother‚Äôs struggles, she quickly reached for the eggs before one of those mean hens could peck her hand. She found them and yanked them back. ‚ÄúGot‚Äòem,‚Äù she whispered, sounding triumphant. ‚ÄúOne for me, one for mom, and one for Danny,‚Äù she counted as she gently laid them in her cupped shirt. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget, an extra one for the back of Danny‚Äôs‚Ä¶head.‚Äù She giggled again, but this time, much louder.

Danny whipped his head around. ‚ÄúWhat are ya laughing at, Beth?‚Äù He yelled, thinking she was making fun of his casting.

‚ÄúNothing!‚Äù She yelled back. She closed the coop, made her way up the porch, and through the doorway‚Äîletting the screen door slam again. Her mother was startled again and shot her a stern, irritated look. Beth froze and her pupils shrank, ‚ÄúSorry, mama.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve told you about that door slamming, honey.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, mama,‚Äù Beth responded, feeling embarrassed.

‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt be slamming Ms. Carla‚Äôs doors either.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam,‚Äù Beth said before joining her mother‚Äôs side at the counter‚Äîgiving her a hug. Marie had placed several pieces of bacon into the cast iron skillet, and lit the stove with a match‚Äîgrease was popping. Beth, at her mother‚Äôs command, washed the eggs in the small sink basin located in the middle of the counter. She grabbed the soap and sponge and got to scrubbing.

Dan, who was still desperately trying to catch something, saw a strange object on the beach (Approximately 15 feet away from where he stood). Intrigued, he put the thought of checking it out in the back of his mind for safekeeping. Raising his hand and fingers up to the sun, he guessed it to be about 9:00 AM(It was 10:00 AM). His arms were tired, his patience was waning thin, and his stomach growled at him; he decided to pack it up. Suddenly, his bobber disappeared with a splash‚Äîhe was in the fight. The crank spun wildly, and the line was being yanked out while his reel whined, like an angry child. He laughed, almost losing his grip on the rod. The fish relaxed, and then Dan, with all his strength, yanked back. If the hook had let go, he would have definitely flown back. After about ten minutes of fighting, he won. The fish was finally caught(or more like breakfast was caught), he thought and chuckled. Lifting it up, his fingers firmly hooked in the gills, Dan felt like a true outdoorsman‚Äîlike his father. His throat choked at the thought.

‚ÄúBeth,‚Äù Marie said, trying to get her distracted daughter‚Äôs attention.

‚ÄúYes, mama?‚Äù Her daughter responded, looking up from her book.

‚ÄúBreakfast is almost ready. Go tell your brother to wash up and sit at the table. You can finish your coloring book later.‚Äù

Beth closed her book and hopped down from her chair. ‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam.‚Äù 

Small, quick, and energetic ten-year-old feet raced across the floor before bursting through the screen door. Beth paused, and almost panicked‚Äîshe caught it before it slammed and let out a sigh of relief. Now looking at her brother, who was cleaning his catch at their dad‚Äôs old cleaning station, she got an idea. While he was gutting his catch, Beth began to slowly creep up behind him‚Äîlooking focused as a hunting cat. ‚ÄúBOO!‚Äù She yelled, causing him to momentarily fumble with his knife.

‚ÄúDamit, Beth!‚Äù He yelled. ‚ÄúJust cut my damn hand.‚Äù He raised it, palm facing his sister.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry Danny. Please don‚Äôt tell mom!‚Äù She pleaded with him, sounding almost sincere, but was mostly scared.

‚ÄúThere,‚Äù he said, pointing to an old rag. ‚ÄúHand me that.‚Äù

Beth remained silent and did as he asked. 

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù he muttered, sounding irritated. He took the rag, ripped it into a bandage, and wrapped it around his hand.

‚ÄúGood as new?‚Äù Beth asked with a nervous chuckle; hoping he wasn‚Äôt going to tattle.

Danny, still irritated by his dumb sister‚Äôs joke, couldn‚Äôt help but smile(maybe even laugh on the inside) ‚ÄúWell, I wouldn‚Äôt go that far.‚Äù 

Beth felt a bit of relief from his smile. ‚ÄúMama wanted me to tell you that breakfast is ready.‚Äù

‚ÄúHell of a way to tell me that,‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúTell mom I‚Äôll be in in a sec.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she responded with her chirpy voice and started towards the door. But something, alluring, caught her eye. Almost like it was calling to her. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that on the beach?‚Äù She asked her brother.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Danny sighed while picking up his knife. ‚ÄúProbably just trash. Same as usual.‚Äù He brushed the dirt and sand off it.

Beth didn‚Äôt think so. Could be treasure, she thought; for a moment, she pictured herself as a swashbuckling pirate who had just come across some shiny booty. ‚ÄúBooty,‚Äù she laughed. Curiosity getting the better of her, she walked over to it. ‚ÄúA necklace,‚Äù she screeched before pulling it out of the sand. It was lined with something. ‚ÄúTeeth?‚Äù But what kind of teeth? Shark? Snake? Boar maybe? No. Alligator teeth. Odd and intriguing markings were etched into them. She undid the latch and went to put it on. Suddenly, the sound of the screen door opening, followed by her mother‚Äôs voice, rang out. ‚ÄúBreakfast. Table. Now!‚Äù

The two kids remained quiet for only a moment and in a daze. ‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam!‚Äù They spoke in unison. Their mom walked back inside. Beth, with a ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù look, glared at Danny. He shrugged, and they both ran towards the door in a hurry. At the bottom of the porch steps, Beth reached out her hand‚Äîholding the necklace. ‚ÄúHere, sorry about the prank.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, Beth. Thank you for the necklace,‚Äù he said while putting it in his pocket. Then he bent over, whispered in her ear: ‚ÄúGet inside before mom yells again.‚Äù She grinned.

Dan, now burning in the hot sun, was enjoying some fishing in his Jon boat‚Äîhoping for better luck. Maybe he could catch a few fish this time, he thought. He gazed down at his watch, which read: 12:30 PM, before cracking open one of his mother‚Äôs beers. ‚ÄúStolen beer tasted better,‚Äù his father once jokingly remarked. He took a sip and savored it. Afterwards, he set the can down on the bench seat, pulled out a nightcrawler from the jar, and hooked it. And with a smooth, clean motion, he sent it flying, and then leaned back in his seat. The water was churning and rocking the boat; it was reflecting the sun‚Äîpiercing Dan‚Äôs brown eyes. He raised his left hand, hoping to block the glare. ‚ÄúDamn, it‚Äôs hot,‚Äù he muttered. The sun, way up in the sky, was beating down on his head; his head began feeling faint. And then, an attractive idea popped into his mind: how about a quick swim? He leaned forward, dipping his hand into the water. A little warm, he thought. Colder than the air at least. He started reeling in the line(that he just casted), stripped down to nothing but his boxers‚Äîand his new necklace‚Äîbefore cannonballing. He hit the water, feeling refreshed, before sinking to the bottom. With his eyes closed, the necklace‚Äôs markings took on a slight glow. Pushing down from the bottom, he broke the surface, took a deep breath, and floated on his back. The markings returned to normal. His imagination began playing tricks on him, but something lurking in the water below him would soon become the least of his worries.

Beth, now at school(Ms. Carla‚Äôs house), was bored out of her mind, and on the brink of dozing. She was busy picking splinters out of her wooden desk, when all of a sudden, she heard her favorite word, ‚Äúscience.‚Äù Her eyes focused.

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù Ms. Carla spoke, addressing Beth and her four classmates. Who were all lined up in a row‚Äîsitting tight in their school chairs. ‚ÄúDoes anyone know what the process of ecdysis is?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt expect them to, but wanted to be pleasantly surprised.

Everyone, besides Ms. Carla, looked at each other in confusion. No surprise there, she thought, and giggled. ‚ÄúDoes anyone know what molting is?‚Äù

Billy, whom Beth considered to be a ‚Äúknow-it-all‚Äù, raised his hand in a flash.

‚ÄúYes, Billy?‚Äù Carla asked, in her teacher's voice, pointing at him.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when snakes lose their skin!‚Äù He yelled, sounding too confident for Beth‚Äôs liking. Brown nose, she thought, but heard it said in her daddy‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Carla chuckled. ‚ÄúVery good Billy.‚Äù Damn it, Beth‚Äôs mind spoke. She knew the answer, but her hand was too slow. Ms. Carla reached for the white chalk and wrote ‚Äúmolting‚Äù on the small blackboard hanging behind her desk. ‚ÄúEcdysis, or Molting, is when a creature, such as bugs, reptiles, birds, and other similar animals, sheds their old and damaged skin or feathers. Can anyone else name another animal that molts?‚Äù

Billy‚Äôs hand shot up again, but Beth stood up, raising hers, trying to get it higher than Billy‚Äôs. It‚Äôs her turn to answer!

‚ÄúYes, Beth?‚Äù Ms. Carla took notice of Beth‚Äôs attempt to outdo Billy.

‚ÄúAlligators!‚Äù Beth yelled, confidently.

‚ÄúYes! Alligators, unlike most other reptiles, which shed their scales over a longer period of time‚Äî‚Äú The alarm clock that Ms. Carla always kept on her desk, was now blaring its obnoxious racket. 2:30 PM. ‚ÄúOkay everyone, school is dismissed for the day. While you‚Äôre outside playing, I want all of you to keep an extra close eye out for any other animals that molt. Okay? And tomorrow, you can share your findings with everyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes Ms. Carla,‚Äù the kids all said together before rushing out the front door, like convicts who just got their walking papers. Ms. Carla leaned by the window‚Äîkeeping an eye on the children as they marched down the dirt road. Their bodies, once detailed in her site, were reduced to silhouettes, and then nothing. She sat back in her chair and enjoyed the newfound silence.

Dan, who was lucky to have found an oyster bed while exploring, was now climbing back into his boat with a small sack full. His hands and feet were pruned, reminding him of his grandmother‚Äôs hands and feet. Oysters and a fish? Dinner is served, he thought, amused by his own humor. He stored away his pole, net, sack of oysters, and his 3 empty beer cans before sitting down by the motor. The boat rocked a little as he plopped. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù He blurted out, startled. Blisters? Numerous clumps had formed around his neck where the necklace hung. They were spreading quickly, and soon, they began to burn. Dan grabbed a cold water bottle out of his cooler. First, rubbed it along his head, and then repeatedly splashed his neck‚Äîbrief relief. A chill was settling into his body. Quickly, he started the motor and made his way for home. The breeze‚Äî cooling the water on his neck‚Äîfelt soothing. 

‚ÄúMomma?‚Äù Beth yelled as she busted through the door(but didn‚Äôt let it slam). Close one, she thought. ‚ÄúMomma?‚Äù

‚ÄúBack here,‚Äù Marie‚Äôs voice traveled from the back yard. Beth threw her book bag on her bed, dumping her books out(she forgot to zip it up), and went out the back door. Her mom was on her hands and knees‚Äîwearing a large sun hat.

‚ÄúHey baby, how was school?‚Äù Marie said as her trowel lifted the dirt. She was planting sago palms‚Äîher favorite.

‚ÄúIt was fun,‚Äù Beth said, joyfully. ‚ÄúWe learned about ecdysis.‚Äù Her mother made a puzzled look. ‚ÄúMolting, mom.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that sounds interesting,‚Äù her mother laughed, and then pointed. ‚ÄúCould you please hand me those potted saplings?‚Äù

Beth nodded. She took one and placed it in the crook of her arm. Picked up another, and carried them over.

‚ÄúNeed some help?‚Äù Her mother said, amused.

‚ÄúI got‚Ä¶it,‚Äù she said, sounding determined. They wanted to slip, but Beth wouldn‚Äôt allow it. ‚ÄúThere! Made it!‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù said Marie, giggling at her daughter‚Äôs tired face. ‚ÄúWhat about those two,‚Äù she pointed, still giggling. 

Beth put her hands on her hips, breathing heavily, and looked over to see. She sighed. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it, honey. I‚Äôm only planting these two for right now.‚Äù

Beth sighed again‚Äîthis time‚Äîrelieved. She began walking back towards the back door.

‚ÄúBeth?‚Äù Her mother said, sounding like she just remembered something.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you seen your brother?‚Äù She said sounding curious.

‚ÄúNo, I hav‚Äî.‚Äù The sound of a boat motor approached. Beth, now getting her second wind, walked around the cabin; she saw her brother‚Äôs boat‚Äîit was beached. Dan shut the motor off(prop already in the air), and lugged the heavy sack of clams to the porch. Marie walked around the house. ‚ÄúFinally back I see. I was starting to get worried.

‚ÄúSorry Mama, I took a swim. Lost track of time,‚Äù he said, dropping the sack with a thud.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù his mother sighed. ‚ÄúThat explains why you‚Äôre almost nak‚Äî‚Äù She paused. ‚ÄúWhat happened to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said, looking at his blister. ‚ÄúWhen I got out, I was covered in them.‚Äù

Marie‚Äôs face made a concerned look. ‚ÄúProbably just a sunburn, Danny. Go in my bedroom, break a leaf off my aloe plant, and rub it on where it‚Äôs red.‚Äù Dan, who was unconvinced that it was sunburn, did as his mother said.

After dinner, the sun began to drop below the horizon line, and a full moon took its place‚Äîbathing the marsh in white light. The time was 12:00 AM, and every creature, big or small, became extra active. A fly, stuck in the web that rested in the corner above Dan‚Äôs bed, began to buzz as a hungry spider indulged in its delightful juices. Danny, attempting to rest, became irritated. Shut up‚Ä¶shut up, he thought. A short time later, the fly was drained and went silent. ‚ÄúThank God,‚Äù he whispered. The burning sensation emanating from his blisters, had subsided; now, replaced by an almost unbearable itch. 

Beth, also in bed, had talked her brother and mother‚Äôs ears off during dinner. ‚ÄúThat dumbass Billy kept trying to answer all the questions today at school.‚Äù

Her mother, shocked by the sudden use of the ‚Äúass‚Äù word, shot a stern look at her. ‚ÄúWatch that mouth, Beth.‚Äù And then her mother pointed at the bar of soap, resting by the sink.

‚ÄúYes, mama,‚Äù Beth said, sounding pouty, before taking another bite of grilled oyster.

Danny snickered and looked to his right. ‚ÄúHey Beth,‚Äù he said, trying to sound playful. ‚ÄúI know how you can shut him up.‚Äù Her eyes perked. Danny balled his fist and hit his left palm with it‚Äîwinking his right eye. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how.‚Äù Beth giggled.

Marie snickered and shook her head before Beth continued talking about her day.

Dan began to scratch as he laid in his soggy sheets. His nails dug deep into his skin and revealed something hiding underneath. He felt as if he had fallen into a pit of fire ants. Was that shit aloe or fucking poison ivy, he thought. Fed up, he rushed to the bathroom, and turned the water to cold; he stood with his eyes closed‚Äîthe itching, temporarily relieved. Minutes later, his eyes opened, and he looked down at his naked body. ‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù he muttered.


4

The next morning, sunlight was now flooding the cabin. Danny, who was wrapped in soaked towels, opened his eyes‚Äîstill exhausted from the night before. He rubbed his eyes, yawned, and got out of bed. He stood, now realizing that his itch was gone‚Äîthank God. He walked towards his door, and as he reached for the handle, he could hear his mother already moving around the kitchen; he could even picture his sister, sitting at the table, impatiently dangling her feet, and ready to be fed. He opened the door. Beth, her hair tangled in knots, giggled and said, ‚ÄúYou look like an Egyptian!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh shut up, Beth,‚Äù he said, lightly and playfully before attempting to remove the towels. He hesitated for a moment. Did I remember to put on underwear last night? He thought. Yes, yes he did. When his head and chest towel dropped, Beth‚Äôs eyes bulged out of their sockets, filled with what Dan assumed was ‚Äúterror‚Äù. His mother‚Äôs jaw was gaping open, and her eyes shared the same fearful gaze. ‚ÄúSon, what happened?‚Äù She cried.

Confused(not remembering), Danny looked down. Protruding from his now open sores, were hard, thick, and rough, dark green callouses.‚ÄúWhat the fuck,‚Äù he said, catching the fact that he just swore in front of his mother‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt notice. Still frightened, Marie reached for the phone, resting on the kitchen table. Beth was still stunned by the sight.

‚ÄúWho are you calling?‚Äù He asked, trying not to panic.

‚ÄúSon,‚Äù his mother could barely say. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling Dr. Burg.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Why?‚Äù He asked, now panicking.

‚ÄúLook at your body, son!‚Äù

Now stressed and angry, he ran to the bathroom and slammed the door. Head down, his palms laid flat against the door; he took a few deep breaths, straightened up, and approached the sink. A cold sweat saturated his body as his eyes wandered. They were everywhere‚Äîhe felt like vomiting. After washing his hands, slightly shaking, he picked at a blister on his left pec. ‚ÄúWhat is this shit,‚Äù he muttered, voice weary. KNOCK! KNOCK! ‚ÄúDanny?‚Äù Beth‚Äôs soft, muffled voice could be heard.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine Beth!‚Äù He yelled, trying to disguise his panic.

She didn‚Äôt respond. Instead, she retook her place at the kitchen table.

A fearful thought arose: my hand? He raised it and removed the large bandage, which his mother had helped put on before he left fishing the day before. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he cried, quietly. Dark green, leather-like skin had grown underneath his knife wound. Feeling nauseous, he stumbled out of the restroom, nearly tripped on the living-room coffee table, and caught himself on his door frame. He paused and breathed deep, catching his breath. And then moments later, comforting hands touched his naked back. 

‚ÄúHoney,‚Äù his mom whispered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, let me help you‚Äù She helped lay him in his bed‚Äîthump. She helped remove his necklace before laying it on his nightstand. ‚ÄúJust close your eyes, baby. The doctor will be here soon.‚Äù Danny closed them, too nauseous to protest. Marie pressed her lips against his forehead‚Äîchecking for heat‚Äîhe‚Äôs burning up. She wiped the sweat from her brow‚Äîfeeling panic build in her lower gut. She rushed through the door, nearly tripping through the living room(copying her son), and landed at the kitchen sink. Beth was still sitting at the kitchen table‚Äîfacing Danny‚Äôs room; She could see her brother beginning to toss and turn, and then her eyes felt thick. Marie reached up and opened the top cabinet(above the sink), and her hands hunted for a rag‚Äîfound one! She ran it under cool water and went back to her son. Danny, now transformed into a biological furnace, was violently thrashing. ‚ÄúDanny!‚Äù His mother cried, crouching to hold down her boy. ‚ÄúPlease‚Äî‚Äú Danny tugged away from her. ‚ÄúBreath! Please calm down honey!‚Äù His mother pleaded, but was violently pushed back‚Äîlanding on the floor. Suddenly, after what felt like hours(but was only 10 minutes), his body relaxed. But his brain was still a roaring fire, causing his body to seize up, and lit his muscle fibers ablaze. Suddenly, the body went limp. 

‚ÄúDanny!‚Äù Beth screamed, now standing in the doorway on the brink of bawling her eyes out. Her brother‚Äôs chest rose with a breath, and then rested with new life. Her mother, hands now covering her mouth, eyes running with tears, rushed to her son. ‚ÄúDanny‚Ä¶‚Äù she whispered. Her son‚Äôs voice, now hoarse, groaned, coughed, and hacked. Then‚Äîfinally‚Äîhis breathing returned to somewhat normal.

Hours passed, the clock struck 12:00 PM, and the house was now quiet. Drips from the faucet rang louder than they should‚Äîsounding like the beat of a drum. Marie thought so, at least. She was dozing at the kitchen table, head down and eyes closed. Suddenly, a slam of a car door blared. Footsteps marched up the porch stairs, and a fist pounded at the door. Marie‚Äôs head shot up‚Äîeyes red and baggy. The Adrenaline leaving her body exposed her to exhaustion. She rubbed her face, but then, another knock rang loud and clear. ‚ÄúComing!‚Äù she yelled. Opening the door, she was greeted by a man in a nice button-up shirt, matched with an equally nice tie, and lightly wrinkled slacks. He was holding a leather medical bag in his left hand. She greeted him: ‚ÄúDoctor Burg, he‚Äôs in here.‚Äù Noticing her urgency, he quickly followed as she led him into her son‚Äôs room. He took a knee beside the bed; he set his bag down beside him. The bag‚Äôs zipper smoothly opened. Dr. Burg raised his left hand to feel the boy‚Äôs head. His right rummaged through the bag. He pulled out a thermometer, and placed it in the boy's ear‚Äîit read: 100 degrees. He turned to look at the boy‚Äôs mother. ‚ÄúHis temps pretty high, Marie, but it‚Äôs not too bad. Keep a cool rag on his head. I‚Äôm also gonna give you something to help break the fever.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure it‚Äôll help?‚Äù She asked, not convinced it was a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù fever.

‚ÄúIt should, here.‚Äù Dr. Burg reached back into his bag and pulled out a bottle‚Äîhe handed it to her. She took it and read: ibuprofen. ‚ÄúShould help bring his fever down a notch,‚Äù he said, hoping it would calm her. 

‚ÄúThank you, but the‚Äî‚Äú she was cut off.

‚ÄúMarie, can we please step out into the living room?‚Äù He said, standing up with his bag in hand.

Marie nodded, ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

Marie stepped back out into the living room with Dr. Burg following her. He set his bag down on the coffee table and quickly rearranged it before zipping it shut. When he looked back at her, he noticed dark circles forming around her eyes. He was concerned, but didn‚Äôt speak about it. ‚ÄúMarie,‚Äù he said, snapping her attention out of a daze. ‚ÄúMarie,‚Äù he repeated, ‚ÄúI know what you‚Äôre gonna ask about‚Ä¶‚Äù he paused, removed his wide-rimmed hat, and wiped some sweat from his balding forehead. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen callouses like that. They‚Äôre almost like‚Äî‚Äú 

‚ÄúScales?‚Äù Marie spoke up, fearing that her suspicions might be confirmed. Dr. Burg made a surprised look, but it quickly molded into a look of uncertainty. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve never seen anything like it. But‚Äîto answer your question‚Äîno. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs scales.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat should I do then?‚Äù Marie asked, arms now crossed, sounding fatigued. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna put in for a sample kit, send it to labs, and hopefully, find a diagnosis. Until then, just keep him cool, and keep those wounds clean. Before I leave, I‚Äôm gonna check them all for signs of infection. I‚Äôm also gonna give you a few things to help keep them sterilized.‚Äù

Dr. Burg pulled a few supplies out of his bag. Things like soap, fresh gauze, bandages, and some antiseptic. Afterward, he zipped his bag up once again and went back in with the boy. He retook his knee and examined the boy‚Äôs wounds. Something else, however, caught his eye. Strange? He thought. Reddening had appeared around the eyes; Dr. Burg placed his thumb and index finger on the bottom and top eyelid. Slowly and gently, he opened them. Oh my God, he thought. The boy had a second pair of ‚Äúclear‚Äù eyelids. His fingers let go, and the boy's eyelids closed back. He finished his examination, got up, and walked back into the living room. Marie was sitting back down, fingers tapping and her right leg bouncing. What if he doesn‚Äôt make it? After his father, I don‚Äôt think I could take it. She brushed the thought away, and looked up; Dr. Burg was finishing up(situating his gear). ‚ÄúAll done?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúYes, Marie. All done.‚Äù

Marie approached the doctor, opened the door, thanked him for coming, and sent him on his way. She shut the door, slid down the back, and sat down. Her hands covered her face. Her eyes built pressure, and her nose began to run‚ÄîShe was sobbing.

Beth, still crying into her pillow, heard her mother‚Äôs cries. She leaned to her side, wiped her tears, and laid still in her bed‚Äîlistening. Mama? She thought. She got up and walked to her door. Slowly, she cracked it and peeked. She could see her mother, still sitting down with her back against the front door; her knees were pulled to her chest and her arms covered her face. Marie leaned back and saw her daughter hiding behind the door. She took a breath and stood; pulled her blond hair into a messy bun, and went to tap on her daughter‚Äôs door. ‚ÄúBeth, baby? Please let me in.‚Äù Her mother said in a calm, comforting way. Beth did as her mother asked before returning to her bed, and plopping her face back into her pillow.

‚ÄúBeth,‚Äù her mother whispered. ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs gonna be alright.‚Äù Marie gave her daughter a kiss on the back of the head. ‚ÄúThe doctor said that Danny just has a bad fever, but he‚Äôs gonna do some tests‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúBut what if he‚Äôs not alright!‚Äù Her daughter yelled into her pillow. Marie put her hand on her daughter's back and patted. She then, curled up next to her daughter and went to sleep.",2,1756654688.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1n4xvuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HersWeightloss/comments/1n4xvuc/naltrexone/,Naltrexone,I switched to kit 2 today.  I've been taking the bupropion for 3 weeks (started on kit 3 but couldn't tolerate the topiromate).  I took half a pill of the naltrexone this morning and two hours later felt extremely nauseous and threw up.  I did take it with food (and coffee).  Any tips?  I'm worried because I have work in two days when I am supposed to take another half pill and I can't be throwing up at work.  Should I take the anti nausea med before taking it or wait to see if I feel nauseous?   Just seeing if anyone had this experience. ,2,1756654657.0,HersWeightloss,0,1.0,False
1n4xvs2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GearShifted/comments/1n4xvs2/should_you_consider_the_best_hybrid_bike/,Should You Consider the Best Hybrid Bike sixthreezero EVRYjourney,"Riding the sixthreezero EVRYjourney felt like stepping into the sweet spot of cycling comfort and practicality. At first glance, it‚Äôs clear this bike isn‚Äôt just about functionality but also making a statement with its sleek and stylish design. With its steel frame and hybrid nature, it offers versatility‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre cruising along a beach path or navigating the streets of a bustling city. Testing it daily for commutes and leisurely rides gave me plenty to love, but also a few things to think about.

**Comfortable and Ergonomic Design**  
One of the first things I noticed was the bike‚Äôs low center of gravity paired with its forward-pedaling design. This combination puts you in an upright position while ensuring proper leg extension. For someone like me who dislikes feeling hunched over after a long ride, the upright frame does wonders for the back and shoulders. The foam saddle is blissfully soft, and the cushioned handgrips kept my hands from feeling fatigued even on longer routes.

**Smooth Riding with 7-Speed Flexibility**  
The seven-speed system became my go-to feature when tackling moderate hills and varied terrains. Shifting gears couldn‚Äôt be easier thanks to the trigger shifter, and the front and rear V-brakes did an excellent job of providing reliable stopping power. On flat city streets, the bike feels like it glides. Its semi-slick 26-inch tires provide a stable and cushioned ride that‚Äôs responsive yet comfortable.  

**Check sixthreezero EVRYjourney price on Amazon.**

**Perfect for Commuters and Cruisers**  
I‚Äôm a fan of multipurpose items, and this bike checks a lot of boxes. It‚Äôs an ideal pick for leisurely beach rides, commuting to work, or even a quick trip through your local park. Its ability to transition between these uses smoothly is a big plus. The built-in rear rack turned out to be an unexpected lifesaver, offering enough room for a small pannier or basket when I didn‚Äôt want to carry a backpack. Whether you‚Äôre in jeans heading to a coffee shop or dressed for a day of errands, it performs well without feeling out of place.

**Good Points**  
- Comfortable foam saddle and handgrips for long riding sessions  
- Seven-speed flexibility makes it easy to handle hills and varied terrains  
- Built to accommodate adult riders from 5‚Äô0‚Äù to 6‚Äô4‚Äù and up to 300 pounds  
- Sturdy steel frame adds durability while maintaining a stylish aesthetic  

**Areas of Concern**  
- At 36.5 pounds, the bike feels a bit heavy when lifting or loading into a car or storage rack  
- The rigid suspension may not suit riders looking for shock absorption on bumpy trails  
- Assembly instructions could be clearer for beginners  

**Alternative Products**  
While testing a variety of hybrid bikes, the EVRYjourney stood out for its comfort and versatility. In comparison, the Schwinn Discover Hybrid Bike offers a suspension fork that might appeal to those who prioritize a smoother ride over gravel or uneven trails. However, Schwinn‚Äôs lack of a forward-pedaling design places slightly more strain on the rider's posture over time. Alternatively, the Vilano Diverse 3.0 emphasizes speed and performance for serious riders but doesn't quite reach the comfort level of the sixthreezero on casual rides. The EVRYjourney excels in ergonomics and design, making it great for people who want stylish functionality.

**Value for Money**  
There‚Äôs something refreshingly simple yet effective about this bike. When factoring in its ergonomic design, quality materials, and versatile features, it justifies its price point. It absolutely evokes that feeling of getting great quality without hauling a hefty price for extra bells and whistles. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest option on the market, it sits comfortably in the middle range for hybrid bikes, delivering impressive value for the price. Riders looking for dependable performance and thoughtful design won‚Äôt feel shortchanged investing in this bicycle.

He Is Still Getting ""D's""","If there is a letter that defines Trump's presidency, it is inarguably ""**D**"". This goes far beyond the childish nicknames, vile insults, and appalling threats he spouts against his supposed enemies. Those are **D**isgusting and **D**isgraceful enough, but don't tell the whole story. The POTUS is supposed the represent the best of America to the world. Instead we have this.

**D**ishonest. Trump told over 30,000 provable lies during his first term and hasn't slowed down a bit since. He casually makes up facts and figures to suit his narrative and expects to be believed.

**D**umb. Plenty of examples exist to show Donald trump's ignorance of history, geography, science, et al. Here is just one. Despite his arrogance and bullying persona, he desperately wants the Nobel Peace Prize. And yet he is planning to change the name of the Department of Defense to the Department of War. Hmm...

**D**eranged. Trump's inconsistencies and flip-flops on policies are not the signs of a stable or mentally well man. His recent increase to a 50% tariff on Brazil because that country is prosecuting its former president Bolsonaro (a friend of Trump) for various crimes is just nuts. It will drive up the cost of coffee. The US has no major coffee industry to protect. And beef in America is getting more and more expensive because of drought and disease. We could certainly use Brazilian beef to keep the price of a Big Mac from rising even further, Donald.

Just to finish up, there is one more area to examine. Much of what Trump does is classless, shallow, and petty. That is who he is. But let's call out these moves for what they are. **D**ick moves. The latest is ending Secret Service protection for Kamala Harris, former VP and his 2024 political opponent. VPs by law receive six months of SS after leaving office. But because of various threats leveled against Harris during their term and during her candidacy, Joe Biden quietly extended that protection for an additional year. Trump? In typical petty fashion, he ended that protection after seven months.

 He also ended SS protection early for Biden's adult children, and for Dr. Anthony Fauci and John Bolton. the latter two because they had the nerve to speak out against him. I can't find evidence of any other president pulling such **D**ick moves. To the contrary. Barack Obama actually extended protection to former Republican VP Dick Cheney, no friend of his but a polarizing figure. 

**""D's""** across the report card for Donald Trump. We could add a couple more, such as **D**anger to the economy and **D**isaffection of our longtime allies ... but why beat a **D**ead horse?",2,1756654617.0,u_MarkZab2591,0,1.0,False

1n4xtr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1n4xtr5/business_travel_service_feedback/,Business Travel Service Feedback,"Hi everyone,

We‚Äôre working on a new¬†**executive mobility**¬†and¬†**business assistant**¬†service and would love your feedback.

When flying into any major city for a short business trip, transport is only part of the equation. The real cost is the time and focus lost to small tasks, last-minute printing, navigating between meetings, finding a caf√© to work, or waiting on Ubers. A simple Uber won‚Äôt anticipate your schedule, and even a chauffeur only solves the driving. Not every up-and-coming entrepreneur has the budget for a full team or a personal assistant, yet those inefficiencies often mean less preparation, less composure, and weaker results in the meetings that matter most.

We want to solve this by giving you a¬†**dedicated driver/business assistant**¬†for the entire day. From airport or hotel pickup, they‚Äôll handle your schedule smoothly, getting you to meetings on time, finding work-friendly lunch spots, running quick errands (printing, coffee, deliveries), and keeping your day free of hassle.

It‚Äôs about more than convenience. Having a professional assistant by your side also adds to your presence and image, helping you show up focused, composed, and prepared, instead of stressed or rushed.

We‚Äôre currently testing pricing at¬†**‚Ç¨250/day**¬†**all-inclusive (car + driver + assistant)**. Our goal isn‚Äôt luxury for the sake of it, but efficiency, reliability, and peace of mind for expats, entrepreneurs, and business travelers who may not have a big corporate team but still want that level of support.

Would this be something you‚Äôd find valuable (or see others using) when traveling for business?

The sun was barely peaking over the horizon when it began to heat the air. The sound of cicadas was blaring. Fog covered the Everglade marshlands like a heavy curtain. The cabin windows were covered in morning dew, and a breeze blew through the dangling wind chime. Small waves caused by passing boats‚Äîmade the tied-up Jon boat wobble. Frogs were croaking, flies were buzzing, and birds were chirping. The rusty, old hinges let out a low scream as the cabin door opened. A boy in his late teens(18), stepped through.

‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù Dan yelled, almost slipping on the wet moss(growing on the deck). He caught himself, hand firmly grabbing on the porch railing. He reattained his footing and stood. Pausing, he waited patiently for the sounds of his mother waking up‚ÄîNothing but silence. ‚ÄúThank God,‚Äù he sighed, quietly knocking the moss off his leather boots. Now, making way towards the water‚Äôs edge, fishing pole in hand and kicking up sand, he rummaged through his pants pocket. Searching for his bait jar‚Äîgot it! He pulled it out and paused; a distant, familiar voice in the back of his mind, came to the front, ‚ÄúNight crawlers are the best, son. But you gotta keep uh sharp eye out for‚Äòem. You hear me, my boy?‚Äù

‚ÄúYe‚Äî‚Äù little Danny was interrupted.

‚ÄúShit,‚Äù Dan muttered as he slapped his neck‚Äîsplattering blood. He raised his hand, saw a squirt of blood, and then his neck had a light itch. ‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs catch me some breakfast,‚Äù He uttered to himself, a light breeze brushed his dark brown hair. He wiped his hand off on his pants(leaving a red stain), unscrewed the jar, pinched his fingers around one of the squirming worms(trying not to crush it), and hooked it. Whoosh! The line went as it flew‚Äîsplash! Dan closed his eyes and took a deep breath. His mind went to a different time. 

‚ÄúOkay now, put the pole over your right shoulder,‚Äù his dad instructed, giving a visual aid. ‚ÄúLike this. Now, you‚Äôre gonna sling it forward, and let your finger release the line.‚Äù His father demonstrated. 

Little Danny closed his eyes; his mind focused on his father‚Äôs words. He got ready‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶opened them. He was back in the present with the calm water glistening as the sun rose higher, thick algae littering the bank, and along with it‚Äî something desiring to be found.

Bethany, Dan‚Äôs ten-year-old sister, began to stir on her uncomfortable, sweaty mattress. As the sun got higher and hotter, so did the house; the cabin would become like an oven at noon, but right now, it was only preheating. She stretched and winced. Her wet clothes and blond hair clung to her. Humidity sucks, she thought. Quickly, she got out of bed and wiped away the sweat from her forehead. Her vision was blurred, and her head was foggy. She paused a moment to listen to the sound of her mother, Marie, moving about the kitchen. Breakfast? Wendy reached for a rag and dipped it into a fresh pail of water, which she kept next to her bed. She wiped away the nasty, sticky sweat‚Äîfeeling refreshed. And now more awake, she picked up her glasses from her rustic dresser and went to join her mother. Whom was now enjoying her beloved time of the day‚Äîdrinking her morning coffee(black). Her door opened, and her mother was sitting at the kitchen table and taking a sip. 

‚ÄúBeth,‚Äù her mother said, sounding lightly groggy. ‚ÄúI need you to grab the eggs out of the coop, please.‚Äù She took another sip of her coffee. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get breakfast started when you get back.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes Mama,‚Äù Beth responded, promptly. The door hinges let out another low screech, and then a slam.

Her mother recoiled, her morning coffee disturbed.

Now digging through the almost dilapidated chicken coop, trying to avoid touching chicken shit, Beth could catch a glimpse of her brother, who was casting and recasting with an irritated way about it. With every cast, there was another grunt out of him. He only does that when they ain‚Äôt biting, she thought, and then giggled. Still amused by her brother‚Äôs struggles, she quickly reached for the eggs before one of those mean hens could peck her hand. She found them and yanked them back. ‚ÄúGot‚Äòem,‚Äù she whispered, sounding triumphant. ‚ÄúOne for me, one for mom, and one for Danny,‚Äù she counted as she gently laid them in her cupped shirt. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget, an extra one for the back of Danny‚Äôs‚Ä¶head.‚Äù She giggled again, but this time, much louder.

Danny whipped his head around. ‚ÄúWhat are ya laughing at, Beth?‚Äù He yelled, thinking she was making fun of his casting.

‚ÄúNothing!‚Äù She yelled back. She closed the coop, made her way up the porch, and through the doorway‚Äîletting the screen door slam again. Her mother was startled again and shot her a stern, irritated look. Beth froze and her pupils shrank, ‚ÄúSorry, mama.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve told you about that door slamming, honey.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, mama,‚Äù Beth responded, feeling embarrassed.

‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt be slamming Ms. Carla‚Äôs doors either.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam,‚Äù Beth said before joining her mother‚Äôs side at the counter‚Äîgiving her a hug. Marie had placed several pieces of bacon into the cast iron skillet, and lit the stove with a match‚Äîgrease was popping. Beth, at her mother‚Äôs command, washed the eggs in the small sink basin located in the middle of the counter. She grabbed the soap and sponge and got to scrubbing.

Dan, who was still desperately trying to catch something, saw a strange object on the beach (Approximately 15 feet away from where he stood). Intrigued, he put the thought of checking it out in the back of his mind for safekeeping. Raising his hand and fingers up to the sun, he guessed it to be about 9:00 AM(It was 10:00 AM). His arms were tired, his patience was waning thin, and his stomach growled at him; he decided to pack it up. Suddenly, his bobber disappeared with a splash‚Äîhe was in the fight. The crank spun wildly, and the line was being yanked out while his reel whined, like an angry child. He laughed, almost losing his grip on the rod. The fish relaxed, and then Dan, with all his strength, yanked back. If the hook had let go, he would have definitely flown back. After about ten minutes of fighting, he won. The fish was finally caught(or more like breakfast was caught), he thought and chuckled. Lifting it up, his fingers firmly hooked in the gills, Dan felt like a true outdoorsman‚Äîlike his father. His throat choked at the thought.

‚ÄúBeth,‚Äù Marie said, trying to get her distracted daughter‚Äôs attention.

‚ÄúYes, mama?‚Äù Her daughter responded, looking up from her book.

‚ÄúBreakfast is almost ready. Go tell your brother to wash up and sit at the table. You can finish your coloring book later.‚Äù

Beth closed her book and hopped down from her chair. ‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam.‚Äù 

Small, quick, and energetic ten-year-old feet raced across the floor before bursting through the screen door. Beth paused, and almost panicked‚Äîshe caught it before it slammed and let out a sigh of relief. Now looking at her brother, who was cleaning his catch at their dad‚Äôs old cleaning station, she got an idea. While he was gutting his catch, Beth began to slowly creep up behind him‚Äîlooking focused as a hunting cat. ‚ÄúBOO!‚Äù She yelled, causing him to momentarily fumble with his knife.

‚ÄúDamit, Beth!‚Äù He yelled. ‚ÄúJust cut my damn hand.‚Äù He raised it, palm facing his sister.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry Danny. Please don‚Äôt tell mom!‚Äù She pleaded with him, sounding almost sincere, but was mostly scared.

‚ÄúThere,‚Äù he said, pointing to an old rag. ‚ÄúHand me that.‚Äù

Beth remained silent and did as he asked. 

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù he muttered, sounding irritated. He took the rag, ripped it into a bandage, and wrapped it around his hand.

‚ÄúGood as new?‚Äù Beth asked with a nervous chuckle; hoping he wasn‚Äôt going to tattle.

Danny, still irritated by his dumb sister‚Äôs joke, couldn‚Äôt help but smile(maybe even laugh on the inside) ‚ÄúWell, I wouldn‚Äôt go that far.‚Äù 

Beth felt a bit of relief from his smile. ‚ÄúMama wanted me to tell you that breakfast is ready.‚Äù

‚ÄúHell of a way to tell me that,‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúTell mom I‚Äôll be in in a sec.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she responded with her chirpy voice and started towards the door. But something, alluring, caught her eye. Almost like it was calling to her. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that on the beach?‚Äù She asked her brother.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Danny sighed while picking up his knife. ‚ÄúProbably just trash. Same as usual.‚Äù He brushed the dirt and sand off it.

Beth didn‚Äôt think so. Could be treasure, she thought; for a moment, she pictured herself as a swashbuckling pirate who had just come across some shiny booty. ‚ÄúBooty,‚Äù she laughed. Curiosity getting the better of her, she walked over to it. ‚ÄúA necklace,‚Äù she screeched before pulling it out of the sand. It was lined with something. ‚ÄúTeeth?‚Äù But what kind of teeth? Shark? Snake? Boar maybe? No. Alligator teeth. Odd and intriguing markings were etched into them. She undid the latch and went to put it on. Suddenly, the sound of the screen door opening, followed by her mother‚Äôs voice, rang out. ‚ÄúBreakfast. Table. Now!‚Äù

The two kids remained quiet for only a moment and in a daze. ‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam!‚Äù They spoke in unison. Their mom walked back inside. Beth, with a ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù look, glared at Danny. He shrugged, and they both ran towards the door in a hurry. At the bottom of the porch steps, Beth reached out her hand‚Äîholding the necklace. ‚ÄúHere, sorry about the prank.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, Beth. Thank you for the necklace,‚Äù he said while putting it in his pocket. Then he bent over, whispered in her ear: ‚ÄúGet inside before mom yells again.‚Äù She grinned.

Dan, now burning in the hot sun, was enjoying some fishing in his Jon boat‚Äîhoping for better luck. Maybe he could catch a few fish this time, he thought. He gazed down at his watch, which read: 12:30 PM, before cracking open one of his mother‚Äôs beers. ‚ÄúStolen beer tasted better,‚Äù his father once jokingly remarked. He took a sip and savored it. Afterwards, he set the can down on the bench seat, pulled out a nightcrawler from the jar, and hooked it. And with a smooth, clean motion, he sent it flying, and then leaned back in his seat. The water was churning and rocking the boat; it was reflecting the sun‚Äîpiercing Dan‚Äôs brown eyes. He raised his left hand, hoping to block the glare. ‚ÄúDamn, it‚Äôs hot,‚Äù he muttered. The sun, way up in the sky, was beating down on his head; his head began feeling faint. And then, an attractive idea popped into his mind: how about a quick swim? He leaned forward, dipping his hand into the water. A little warm, he thought. Colder than the air at least. He started reeling in the line(that he just casted), stripped down to nothing but his boxers‚Äîand his new necklace‚Äîbefore cannonballing. He hit the water, feeling refreshed, before sinking to the bottom. With his eyes closed, the necklace‚Äôs markings took on a slight glow. Pushing down from the bottom, he broke the surface, took a deep breath, and floated on his back. The markings returned to normal. His imagination began playing tricks on him, but something lurking in the water below him would soon become the least of his worries.

Beth, now at school(Ms. Carla‚Äôs house), was bored out of her mind, and on the brink of dozing. She was busy picking splinters out of her wooden desk, when all of a sudden, she heard her favorite word, ‚Äúscience.‚Äù Her eyes focused.

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù Ms. Carla spoke, addressing Beth and her four classmates. Who were all lined up in a row‚Äîsitting tight in their school chairs. ‚ÄúDoes anyone know what the process of ecdysis is?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt expect them to, but wanted to be pleasantly surprised.

Everyone, besides Ms. Carla, looked at each other in confusion. No surprise there, she thought, and giggled. ‚ÄúDoes anyone know what molting is?‚Äù

Billy, whom Beth considered to be a ‚Äúknow-it-all‚Äù, raised his hand in a flash.

‚ÄúYes, Billy?‚Äù Carla asked, in her teacher's voice, pointing at him.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when snakes lose their skin!‚Äù He yelled, sounding too confident for Beth‚Äôs liking. Brown nose, she thought, but heard it said in her daddy‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Carla chuckled. ‚ÄúVery good Billy.‚Äù Damn it, Beth‚Äôs mind spoke. She knew the answer, but her hand was too slow. Ms. Carla reached for the white chalk and wrote ‚Äúmolting‚Äù on the small blackboard hanging behind her desk. ‚ÄúEcdysis, or Molting, is when a creature, such as bugs, reptiles, birds, and other similar animals, sheds their old and damaged skin or feathers. Can anyone else name another animal that molts?‚Äù

Billy‚Äôs hand shot up again, but Beth stood up, raising hers, trying to get it higher than Billy‚Äôs. It‚Äôs her turn to answer!

‚ÄúYes, Beth?‚Äù Ms. Carla took notice of Beth‚Äôs attempt to outdo Billy.

‚ÄúAlligators!‚Äù Beth yelled, confidently.

‚ÄúYes! Alligators, unlike most other reptiles, which shed their scales over a longer period of time‚Äî‚Äú The alarm clock that Ms. Carla always kept on her desk, was now blaring its obnoxious racket. 2:30 PM. ‚ÄúOkay everyone, school is dismissed for the day. While you‚Äôre outside playing, I want all of you to keep an extra close eye out for any other animals that molt. Okay? And tomorrow, you can share your findings with everyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes Ms. Carla,‚Äù the kids all said together before rushing out the front door, like convicts who just got their walking papers. Ms. Carla leaned by the window‚Äîkeeping an eye on the children as they marched down the dirt road. Their bodies, once detailed in her site, were reduced to silhouettes, and then nothing. She sat back in her chair and enjoyed the newfound silence.

Dan, who was lucky to have found an oyster bed while exploring, was now climbing back into his boat with a small sack full. His hands and feet were pruned, reminding him of his grandmother‚Äôs hands and feet. Oysters and a fish? Dinner is served, he thought, amused by his own humor. He stored away his pole, net, sack of oysters, and his 3 empty beer cans before sitting down by the motor. The boat rocked a little as he plopped. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù He blurted out, startled. Blisters? Numerous clumps had formed around his neck where the necklace hung. They were spreading quickly, and soon, they began to burn. Dan grabbed a cold water bottle out of his cooler. First, rubbed it along his head, and then repeatedly splashed his neck‚Äîbrief relief. A chill was settling into his body. Quickly, he started the motor and made his way for home. The breeze‚Äî cooling the water on his neck‚Äîfelt soothing. 

‚ÄúMomma?‚Äù Beth yelled as she busted through the door(but didn‚Äôt let it slam). Close one, she thought. ‚ÄúMomma?‚Äù

‚ÄúBack here,‚Äù Marie‚Äôs voice traveled from the back yard. Beth threw her book bag on her bed, dumping her books out(she forgot to zip it up), and went out the back door. Her mom was on her hands and knees‚Äîwearing a large sun hat.

‚ÄúHey baby, how was school?‚Äù Marie said as her trowel lifted the dirt. She was planting sago palms‚Äîher favorite.

‚ÄúIt was fun,‚Äù Beth said, joyfully. ‚ÄúWe learned about ecdysis.‚Äù Her mother made a puzzled look. ‚ÄúMolting, mom.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that sounds interesting,‚Äù her mother laughed, and then pointed. ‚ÄúCould you please hand me those potted saplings?‚Äù

Beth nodded. She took one and placed it in the crook of her arm. Picked up another, and carried them over.

‚ÄúNeed some help?‚Äù Her mother said, amused.

‚ÄúI got‚Ä¶it,‚Äù she said, sounding determined. They wanted to slip, but Beth wouldn‚Äôt allow it. ‚ÄúThere! Made it!‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù said Marie, giggling at her daughter‚Äôs tired face. ‚ÄúWhat about those two,‚Äù she pointed, still giggling. 

Beth put her hands on her hips, breathing heavily, and looked over to see. She sighed. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it, honey. I‚Äôm only planting these two for right now.‚Äù

Beth sighed again‚Äîthis time‚Äîrelieved. She began walking back towards the back door.

‚ÄúBeth?‚Äù Her mother said, sounding like she just remembered something.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you seen your brother?‚Äù She said sounding curious.

‚ÄúNo, I hav‚Äî.‚Äù The sound of a boat motor approached. Beth, now getting her second wind, walked around the cabin; she saw her brother‚Äôs boat‚Äîit was beached. Dan shut the motor off(prop already in the air), and lugged the heavy sack of clams to the porch. Marie walked around the house. ‚ÄúFinally back I see. I was starting to get worried.

‚ÄúSorry Mama, I took a swim. Lost track of time,‚Äù he said, dropping the sack with a thud.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù his mother sighed. ‚ÄúThat explains why you‚Äôre almost nak‚Äî‚Äù She paused. ‚ÄúWhat happened to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said, looking at his blister. ‚ÄúWhen I got out, I was covered in them.‚Äù

Marie‚Äôs face made a concerned look. ‚ÄúProbably just a sunburn, Danny. Go in my bedroom, break a leaf off my aloe plant, and rub it on where it‚Äôs red.‚Äù Dan, who was unconvinced that it was sunburn, did as his mother said.

After dinner, the sun began to drop below the horizon line, and a full moon took its place‚Äîbathing the marsh in white light. The time was 12:00 AM, and every creature, big or small, became extra active. A fly, stuck in the web that rested in the corner above Dan‚Äôs bed, began to buzz as a hungry spider indulged in its delightful juices. Danny, attempting to rest, became irritated. Shut up‚Ä¶shut up, he thought. A short time later, the fly was drained and went silent. ‚ÄúThank God,‚Äù he whispered. The burning sensation emanating from his blisters, had subsided; now, replaced by an almost unbearable itch. 

Beth, also in bed, had talked her brother and mother‚Äôs ears off during dinner. ‚ÄúThat dumbass Billy kept trying to answer all the questions today at school.‚Äù

Her mother, shocked by the sudden use of the ‚Äúass‚Äù word, shot a stern look at her. ‚ÄúWatch that mouth, Beth.‚Äù And then her mother pointed at the bar of soap, resting by the sink.

‚ÄúYes, mama,‚Äù Beth said, sounding pouty, before taking another bite of grilled oyster.

Danny snickered and looked to his right. ‚ÄúHey Beth,‚Äù he said, trying to sound playful. ‚ÄúI know how you can shut him up.‚Äù Her eyes perked. Danny balled his fist and hit his left palm with it‚Äîwinking his right eye. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how.‚Äù Beth giggled.

Marie snickered and shook her head before Beth continued talking about her day.

Dan began to scratch as he laid in his soggy sheets. His nails dug deep into his skin and revealed something hiding underneath. He felt as if he had fallen into a pit of fire ants. Was that shit aloe or fucking poison ivy, he thought. Fed up, he rushed to the bathroom, and turned the water to cold; he stood with his eyes closed‚Äîthe itching, temporarily relieved. Minutes later, his eyes opened, and he looked down at his naked body. ‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù he muttered.

The next morning, sunlight was now flooding the cabin. Danny, who was wrapped in soaked towels, opened his eyes‚Äîstill exhausted from the night before. He rubbed his eyes, yawned, and got out of bed. He stood, now realizing that his itch was gone‚Äîthank God. He walked towards his door, and as he reached for the handle, he could hear his mother already moving around the kitchen; he could even picture his sister, sitting at the table, impatiently dangling her feet, and ready to be fed. He opened the door. Beth, her hair tangled in knots, giggled and said, ‚ÄúYou look like an Egyptian!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh shut up, Beth,‚Äù he said, lightly and playfully before attempting to remove the towels. He hesitated for a moment. Did I remember to put on underwear last night? He thought. Yes, yes he did. When his head and chest towel dropped, Beth‚Äôs eyes bulged out of their sockets, filled with what Dan assumed was ‚Äúterror‚Äù. His mother‚Äôs jaw was gaping open, and her eyes shared the same fearful gaze. ‚ÄúSon, what happened?‚Äù She cried.

Confused(not remembering), Danny looked down. Protruding from his now open sores, were hard, thick, and rough, dark green callouses.‚ÄúWhat the fuck,‚Äù he said, catching the fact that he just swore in front of his mother‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt notice. Still frightened, Marie reached for the phone, resting on the kitchen table. Beth was still stunned by the sight.

‚ÄúWho are you calling?‚Äù He asked, trying not to panic.

‚ÄúSon,‚Äù his mother could barely say. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling Dr. Burg.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Why?‚Äù He asked, now panicking.

‚ÄúLook at your body, son!‚Äù

Now stressed and angry, he ran to the bathroom and slammed the door. Head down, his palms laid flat against the door; he took a few deep breaths, straightened up, and approached the sink. A cold sweat saturated his body as his eyes wandered. They were everywhere‚Äîhe felt like vomiting. After washing his hands, slightly shaking, he picked at a blister on his left pec. ‚ÄúWhat is this shit,‚Äù he muttered, voice weary. KNOCK! KNOCK! ‚ÄúDanny?‚Äù Beth‚Äôs soft, muffled voice could be heard.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine Beth!‚Äù He yelled, trying to disguise his panic.

She didn‚Äôt respond. Instead, she retook her place at the kitchen table.

A fearful thought arose: my hand? He raised it and removed the large bandage, which his mother had helped put on before he left fishing the day before. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he cried, quietly. Dark green, leather-like skin had grown underneath his knife wound. Feeling nauseous, he stumbled out of the restroom, nearly tripped on the living-room coffee table, and caught himself on his door frame. He paused and breathed deep, catching his breath. And then moments later, comforting hands touched his naked back. 

‚ÄúHoney,‚Äù his mom whispered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, let me help you‚Äù She helped lay him in his bed‚Äîthump. She helped remove his necklace before laying it on his nightstand. ‚ÄúJust close your eyes, baby. The doctor will be here soon.‚Äù Danny closed them, too nauseous to protest. Marie pressed her lips against his forehead‚Äîchecking for heat‚Äîhe‚Äôs burning up. She wiped the sweat from her brow‚Äîfeeling panic build in her lower gut. She rushed through the door, nearly tripping through the living room(copying her son), and landed at the kitchen sink. Beth was still sitting at the kitchen table‚Äîfacing Danny‚Äôs room; She could see her brother beginning to toss and turn, and then her eyes felt thick. Marie reached up and opened the top cabinet(above the sink), and her hands hunted for a rag‚Äîfound one! She ran it under cool water and went back to her son. Danny, now transformed into a biological furnace, was violently thrashing. ‚ÄúDanny!‚Äù His mother cried, crouching to hold down her boy. ‚ÄúPlease‚Äî‚Äú Danny tugged away from her. ‚ÄúBreath! Please calm down honey!‚Äù His mother pleaded, but was violently pushed back‚Äîlanding on the floor. Suddenly, after what felt like hours(but was only 10 minutes), his body relaxed. But his brain was still a roaring fire, causing his body to seize up, and lit his muscle fibers ablaze. Suddenly, the body went limp. 

‚ÄúDanny!‚Äù Beth screamed, now standing in the doorway on the brink of bawling her eyes out. Her brother‚Äôs chest rose with a breath, and then rested with new life. Her mother, hands now covering her mouth, eyes running with tears, rushed to her son. ‚ÄúDanny‚Ä¶‚Äù she whispered. Her son‚Äôs voice, now hoarse, groaned, coughed, and hacked. Then‚Äîfinally‚Äîhis breathing returned to somewhat normal.

Hours passed, the clock struck 12:00 PM, and the house was now quiet. Drips from the faucet rang louder than they should‚Äîsounding like the beat of a drum. Marie thought so, at least. She was dozing at the kitchen table, head down and eyes closed. Suddenly, a slam of a car door blared. Footsteps marched up the porch stairs, and a fist pounded at the door. Marie‚Äôs head shot up‚Äîeyes red and baggy. The Adrenaline leaving her body exposed her to exhaustion. She rubbed her face, but then, another knock rang loud and clear. ‚ÄúComing!‚Äù she yelled. Opening the door, she was greeted by a man in a nice button-up shirt, matched with an equally nice tie, and lightly wrinkled slacks. He was holding a leather medical bag in his left hand. She greeted him: ‚ÄúDoctor Burg, he‚Äôs in here.‚Äù Noticing her urgency, he quickly followed as she led him into her son‚Äôs room. He took a knee beside the bed; he set his bag down beside him. The bag‚Äôs zipper smoothly opened. Dr. Burg raised his left hand to feel the boy‚Äôs head. His right rummaged through the bag. He pulled out a thermometer, and placed it in the boy's ear‚Äîit read: 100 degrees. He turned to look at the boy‚Äôs mother. ‚ÄúHis temps pretty high, Marie, but it‚Äôs not too bad. Keep a cool rag on his head. I‚Äôm also gonna give you something to help break the fever.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure it‚Äôll help?‚Äù She asked, not convinced it was a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù fever.

‚ÄúIt should, here.‚Äù Dr. Burg reached back into his bag and pulled out a bottle‚Äîhe handed it to her. She took it and read: ibuprofen. ‚ÄúShould help bring his fever down a notch,‚Äù he said, hoping it would calm her. 

‚ÄúThank you, but the‚Äî‚Äú she was cut off.

‚ÄúMarie, can we please step out into the living room?‚Äù He said, standing up with his bag in hand.

Marie nodded, ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

Marie stepped back out into the living room with Dr. Burg following her. He set his bag down on the coffee table and quickly rearranged it before zipping it shut. When he looked back at her, he noticed dark circles forming around her eyes. He was concerned, but didn‚Äôt speak about it. ‚ÄúMarie,‚Äù he said, snapping her attention out of a daze. ‚ÄúMarie,‚Äù he repeated, ‚ÄúI know what you‚Äôre gonna ask about‚Ä¶‚Äù he paused, removed his wide-rimmed hat, and wiped some sweat from his balding forehead. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen callouses like that. They‚Äôre almost like‚Äî‚Äú 

‚ÄúScales?‚Äù Marie spoke up, fearing that her suspicions might be confirmed. Dr. Burg made a surprised look, but it quickly molded into a look of uncertainty. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve never seen anything like it. But‚Äîto answer your question‚Äîno. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs scales.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat should I do then?‚Äù Marie asked, arms now crossed, sounding fatigued. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna put in for a sample kit, send it to labs, and hopefully, find a diagnosis. Until then, just keep him cool, and keep those wounds clean. Before I leave, I‚Äôm gonna check them all for signs of infection. I‚Äôm also gonna give you a few things to help keep them sterilized.‚Äù

Dr. Burg pulled a few supplies out of his bag. Things like soap, fresh gauze, bandages, and some antiseptic. Afterward, he zipped his bag up once again and went back in with the boy. He retook his knee and examined the boy‚Äôs wounds. Something else, however, caught his eye. Strange? He thought. Reddening had appeared around the eyes; Dr. Burg placed his thumb and index finger on the bottom and top eyelid. Slowly and gently, he opened them. Oh my God, he thought. The boy had a second pair of ‚Äúclear‚Äù eyelids. His fingers let go, and the boy's eyelids closed back. He finished his examination, got up, and walked back into the living room. Marie was sitting back down, fingers tapping and her right leg bouncing. What if he doesn‚Äôt make it? After his father, I don‚Äôt think I could take it. She brushed the thought away, and looked up; Dr. Burg was finishing up(situating his gear). ‚ÄúAll done?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúYes, Marie. All done.‚Äù

Marie approached the doctor, opened the door, thanked him for coming, and sent him on his way. She shut the door, slid down the back, and sat down. Her hands covered her face. Her eyes built pressure, and her nose began to run‚ÄîShe was sobbing.

Beth, still crying into her pillow, heard her mother‚Äôs cries. She leaned to her side, wiped her tears, and laid still in her bed‚Äîlistening. Mama? She thought. She got up and walked to her door. Slowly, she cracked it and peeked. She could see her mother, still sitting down with her back against the front door; her knees were pulled to her chest and her arms covered her face. Marie leaned back and saw her daughter hiding behind the door. She took a breath and stood; pulled her blond hair into a messy bun, and went to tap on her daughter‚Äôs door. ‚ÄúBeth, baby? Please let me in.‚Äù Her mother said in a calm, comforting way. Beth did as her mother asked before returning to her bed, and plopping her face back into her pillow.

‚ÄúBeth,‚Äù her mother whispered. ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs gonna be alright.‚Äù Marie gave her daughter a kiss on the back of the head. ‚ÄúThe doctor said that Danny just has a bad fever, but he‚Äôs gonna do some tests‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúBut what if he‚Äôs not alright!‚Äù Her daughter yelled into her pillow. Marie put her hand on her daughter's back and patted. She then, curled up next to her daughter and went to sleep.",2,1756654502.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I have heard that having excess stomach fat makes gerd worse, not sure about big boobs and/or chest fat. I did manage to get to 75kg last year, but put some of the weight back on, i take antidepressants and antipsychotics, and have pcos, so maintaining weight loss alone is difficult. 


If any of you have or had gerd, did losing weight help, especially around the chest and tummy? I dont mind hearing from people who dont have breasts on this one. I know from my experiences last year that when i lose weight, bc most of the weight is in my chest and tummy, thats the first place to lose and it becomes quite noticeable quick, so im not overly worried about being stuck w a big chest and tummy, bc i dont have that much fat in other areas to lose anyway.

1n4xpye,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1n4xpye/should_you_get_the_best_espresso_machine_delonghi/,Should You Get the Best Espresso Machine DeLonghi Dedica Arte?,"Experimenting daily with coffee-making devices has turned into one of my favorite rituals, and testing the De'Longhi EC885M espresso machine was an intriguing experience that brought some unexpected surprises. As someone who values both functionality and aesthetics in kitchen appliances, a compact yet highly capable espresso machine like this piqued my curiosity immediately. The customizable brewing options alongside its sleek Italian design made it an immediate contender in any coffee lover's home.

**Build and Design Sleekness**

This espresso machine features an impressively compact design at just 6 inches wide, making it a perfect fit for any countertop, especially in smaller kitchens. I appreciated its stainless steel finish, which gives it a high-end, professional yet modern feel ‚Äî like it belongs in a chic caf√©. The small size didn‚Äôt compromise its usability, though. Despite its slim profile, it didn‚Äôt feel cramped or difficult to navigate. Buttons had a pleasant tactile response, and the layout was intuitive even for someone who hadn‚Äôt studied the instruction manual in detail.

**Performance Perks**

The professional 15-bar pump system consistently delivered rich and creamy espresso shots. The adjustable controls let me fine-tune my morning brew based on how strong or smooth I wanted it to taste. Paired with the included professional tamper and spacious filter basket that holds up to 18g of ground coffee, this machine allowed me to achieve barista-level beverages. Every cup met the standard I get at my local coffee shop, while staying conveniently at home.

[Check De'Longhi EC885M price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b09hlb4dp4/)

**My LatteArt Steam Wand‚Äôs Flexibility**

The steam wand stole the show for me. Its capability to create that perfect, silky milk texture made my cappuccinos and lattes feel like indulgent treats. I even attempted some basic latte art‚Äîand while I‚Äôm far from professional, the wand‚Äôs precision made my swirls look reasonably refined. Plus, this versatile wand didn‚Äôt restrict milk consistency, so preferences for foam density were easily manageable.

**Adaptability with Brewing Choices**

If you‚Äôre someone who craves variety, the machine gives it to you. The adjustable double drip tray allowed for taller cups, like latte glasses, without a hitch. One day I could enjoy a simple, strong espresso in a petite demitasse, and the next day indulge in a full-bodied latte thanks to its accommodating design. The Automatic Flow Stop feature was another time-saving functionality. Espresso stopped flowing at precisely the right moment, requiring no fiddling or guesswork on my end.

**Strengths**

- Professional-grade 15-bar pressure for optimal coffee flavor  
- Slim design that effortlessly fits any countertop  
- Versatile steam wand ideal for latte art  
- Adjustable drip tray for tall cups or glasses  

**Drawbacks**

- Limited capacity of a 35-ounce water tank may not suit larger households  
- Moderate noise while brewing, which can be disruptive in the early morning  
- Requires regular cleaning of the steam wand to ensure performance  

**Competing Brands**

Comparing this machine to similar models, its closest rivals include the Breville Bambino and the Gaggia Classic. While the Breville Bambino matches the De'Longhi EC885M‚Äôs compact size, it falls short on overall design elegance and adaptability of taller cups. The Gaggia Classic, though capable of producing high-quality espresso, delivers a more traditional aesthetic and lacks the modern flair the De'Longhi brings. Both competitors lack the My LatteArt steam wand's nuanced control for advanced milk frothing.

**True Value**

Although the De'Longhi EC885M is positioned in a mid-to-high price range, its feature-packed performance justifies every penny. From its structural design to the professional quality of espresso, this machine delivers what it promises. Investing in a coffee shop experience without leaving your kitchen saves money in the long term for larger daily coffee drinkers like myself.

1n4xp1p,https://i.redd.it/m0cvhjv3hdmf1.jpeg,Lost one of my girls last night. Need some advice on next steps.,"Just really really sucks. I've had two chickens, Betty and Ethel, for \~2 years now. Came with the house I bought. I have fed them every day and night, locked them up every night and let them out every morning, no problems. They have fought off a hawk in the daytime before, but I work from home so I was able to get out there quick. However last night something got over/under my 8ft fence, got into the wired-off area of my yard where the coop is, and somehow got the door open. It had a very simple latch lock, but seemed secure enough to work all this time. Locked it up as normal last night, but when making coffee this morning I saw Ethel walking around on her own and immediately panicked. Ran outside and found Betty's body. Ethel is scared and confused but finally eating her seeds this morning. I buried Betty next to her favorite tree, and she even left me one last egg. RIP Betty. She even just started letting me pick her up recently.

  
I've cried as much as I can, so at this point I need some help:

  
\- What can I do to reinforce the coop door to prevent a critter from getting in again? It has a ""bathroom door"" latch, which apparently isn't as secure as I thought if something really wants in. I have sealed off any areas where something could have crawled under my fence at this point. Which speaking of...  
\- What the hell could have done this? I have seen hawks, groundhogs, skunks, possums, and raccoons in my yard before, but none of them aside from the hawk have shown any interest to my girls. Unfortunately it was a neck-based attack, which makes me assume a fox. Which could also scratch open a door latch if it tried hard enough I suppose, but it feels crazy to think about. Do I need to try and trap it?  
\- Ethel is very codependent, as both her and Betty were apparently survivors of a previous attack and are 2/5 of the chickens the previous homeowners had. How soon can I get her acclimated to another chicken? She needs a friend, but I don't know how this works at all. Does it need to be younger/older? Will she even accept another chicken in the coop?

I have been financing myself since last 4-5 years. I take very little to no money from home (My family has an unstable financial situation). My income source is through tuitions. What I earn in a month goes by in a blink, food, rent, bills and especially on transportation. I dropped out of uni as it was becoming a burden on my family. I avoid places where I know I have to spend (hangouts, trips, etc). I feel drained and lifeless everyday. I‚Äôm very frustrated at this point. 
On top of that, due to some issues I couldn't work through the last two months (June, July). 

To be financially independent and to pay for my own tuition fees, I want to start a business asap, a tea/coffee/juice stall at an area with high foot traffic in Dhaka. 

What I'm seeking right now is a loan of 800 USDT/USDC, which I can repay in 3 months time with interest (rates can be set by lender). I can pay back in monthly installments. I'm willing to provide any necessary documents (passport, nid, tin certificate, current address, etc.). I am unable to provide any collateral because I don't have any assets in my name. I cannot opt for bank loan because I don't have a steady statement.

I know this is very random but my back is against the wall right now. I have bigger dreams, which I hope to fulfill when I have a stable situation and on my own. But I'm not getting the chance to get to that stable situation. This help will greatly impact my life. 

I will be deleting this post soon, it's actually very embarrassing for me to be asking like this but I currently have no one who can help me with this matter.

Whoever is genuinely interested in helping me, please message me, I will elaborate my situation and share my business plan.

Planned everything out.

\- Base consonant always = consonant + ‚Äúa‚Äù (default).   
\- Vowel diacritics = swap that ‚Äúa‚Äù for other vowels.   
\- Virama-like mark = kill the vowel if the consonant is ending a word or preceding another consonant. - - Stress mark (tiny underline or similar) = only used for English double consonants (like ‚Äúbutter,‚Äù ‚Äúhappen,‚Äù ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù).   
\-Extra consonants (sh, ch, ng, gh, th, dh, etc.) = treated as single letters because English thinks of them that way in spelling- easier to write in abugida.   
\-No need for aspirated phoneme letters (like Devanagari/Dravidian language‚Äôs kh, ph, jh) since English doesn‚Äôt distinguish them. Except gh.

So...I planned it all out. I'm set, good to go. BUTTTT- I don't know how to design the script.

I want it to look aesthetically pleasing in those Indian abugida styles- I've not only looked at Hindi or Sanskrit, but even some southern languages like...Telugu, Kannada, etc. Tamil and Malayalam and so on seemed a bit too complicated for me. So you can see I put in a lot of unnecessary work for conscription that I will keep private to myself for personal matters. Just because I wanted to have some fun. Funny thing is if possible I was trying to mix any other countries' styles if possible- like N√ºshu or Arabic, because they're written in an aesthetically pleasing way where there is a flow to the script, you know? But then i decided against N√ºshu because it's vertical with multiple strokes- I want my script to be quick and efficient. Arabic looked nice, but I had no idea how to fuse that script with my abugida script, especially when I was looking at Indian languages' scripts for a while now.

I even looked up Persian and Greek for a little bit. No idea if my creativity ran out just for the drawing part of the symbols. I've made a conscript before. That one was easier- I made it in class when I was bored. Its structure was alphabetical, and the script had sides and corners like squares, literally almost like the nyctography Lewis Caroll made. I was somehow so into it that I made the conscript and wrote enough to be able to somehow memorise and write fluently in ONLY that lesson.

So....yeah.

I'm sorry, I seemed to have rambled. But...what I'm trying to say is, I need ideas on how I can create the actual script, how to get it to be the aesthetic I want in symbols that will suit the abugida style and not close enough to any abugida language so it won't be easy for the people around me to decipher it.

....pls help guys. I'm so excited!

(I've not been doing well lately so I've pushed away any activities or hobbies I had and resorted to mindless doomscrolling, but I feel like I'm slowly regaining my drive and this is one of the first self-projects I picked up! Came by this idea when i thought I could create my own script so that I could try out the journaling method and no snoopy parents or friends will go through it and see me be all vulnerable.

1n4xdbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1n4xdbp/reveal_the_truth_about_ginger_lily_farms_rinse/,Reveal the Truth About Ginger Lily Farms Rinse Aid Effectiveness,"The Ginger Lily Farms Botanicals Plant-Based Dishwasher Rinse Aid, model 802541, caught my attention as a plant-based, eco-conscious household product. With a focus on being vegan, cruelty-free, and fragrance-free, it intrigued me right from the start. I put it to the test to see if it could live up to its claims, especially since I'm someone who values quality cleaning products that are kind to the environment.

**Design and Formula**  
The liquid rinse aid comes in a generous gallon-sized bottle, making it practical for both residential and commercial use. The eco-friendly angle is apparent as the product is made from plant-based, biodegradable ingredients rather than the petroleum-based components found in many conventional alternatives. Its gentle, fragrance-free formula was a welcome relief in my home, where sensitivities to strong chemical smells can be an issue. The thick, translucent liquid pours easily without causing a mess, and the secure cap prevents annoying leaks during storage.

**Performance with Stubborn Stains**  
From the first cycle in the dishwasher, I noticed how well this rinse aid tackled stubborn residues. Whether it was dried-on coffee stains or the occasional caked-on food, the results were impressive. Spots, streaks, and hard water marks that would usually linger on glasses and dinnerware were completely gone. My most frequent annoyance‚Äîcloudy glasses‚Äîwas a thing of the past. Even without pre-rinsing (which this product promises to eliminate the need for), dishes emerged looking impeccable. I tested it with a mix of plastics, glassware, and stainless steel utensils, and across the board, all came out spotless and shiny.

**Key Benefits**  
- The plant-based, biodegradable nature is a win for eco-conscious buyers.  
- Outstanding performance against hard water stains and stubborn residues.  
- Keeps dishes, glasses, and flatware streak-free and sparkling with no pre-rinsing required.  
- Fragrance-free formula suits households with sensitivities to strong odors.  

[Check Ginger Lily Farms 802541 price on Amazon.](https://sanue.com/p/b0bhf5bsts/)

**Commercial Washer Compatibility**  
Since it‚Äôs recommended for commercial washers as well, I took the opportunity to try it at a friend‚Äôs small caf√© with a heavy-duty machine. To my surprise, it yielded equally impressive results both in high and low-temperature cycles. Large-scale dishwashing operations, like restaurants or catering businesses, will likely find this rinse aid to be a cost-effective and efficient choice.

**Water Hardness Friendliness**  
Living in an area with somewhat hard water, I often struggle with dull dishware and residue buildup. This rinse aid worked like a charm in minimizing mineral deposits that water alone would usually leave on my items. Over time, there seemed to be a noticeable reduction in the buildup within my dishwasher too, proving its utility in combating hard water challenges.

**Other Options**  
While this product offers impressive results, other brands like Finish or Cascade come to mind as its direct competitors. Both manufacture rinse aids known for effective performance but often rely on synthetic chemicals and strong fragrances. Compared to these, the Ginger Lily Farms offering certainly stands out for its environmental advantages and suitability for sensitive users. That said, the more established brands may have an edge in areas like faster drying time or performance in extremely hard water conditions.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
The price point for this product falls slightly higher than some mainstream options. However, what you pay for here is the peace of mind that you're using an eco-friendly and vegan alternative that doesn‚Äôt skimp on performance. For a refill size that broadens its value over time, I found it to be a smart and sustainable choice. Similar products lacking the plant-based formula often compromise on either size or quality, making this gallon-sized offer a better investment.

**Areas of Concern**  
- The lack of a convenient pour spout on such a large gallon-sized bottle can make dispensing tricky.  
- It's slightly pricier compared to other chemical-based rinse aids, although the quality makes up for it.

1n4xcfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1n4xcfu/should_you_invest_in_bluevua_countertop_water/,"Should You Invest in Bluevua Countertop Water Filter Review for Cleaner, Safer Drinking Water?","**A Multi-Stage Filtration System Worth Experiencing**  
The Bluevua A-JSJ-LPD-100UV-BMT Reverse Osmosis Countertop Water Filter is one of the most reliable and aesthetically pleasing filtration systems I‚Äôve had the chance to try. This sleek and portable filtration unit combines advanced technology with practicality, ensuring high-quality water at home without the hassle of complicated under-sink installations. I‚Äôve been testing it for weeks now, and let me say, it definitely lives up to its promises, though not without some areas for improvement.  

**High-Performance Filtration for Impressive Purity**  
This unit‚Äôs six-stage filtration system truly sets it apart from other water filters. With RO membranes and UV light in the mix, impurities like chlorine, fluoride, lead, and PFOS are effectively filtered out. It also has a remineralization filter, so the water isn‚Äôt just free of contaminants‚Äîit‚Äôs balanced with essential minerals that improve taste and health benefits. Testing it myself, the water tasted noticeably fresh and smooth compared to my basic pitcher filter. I particularly appreciate how thorough the results feel; this system is certified by reputable testing entities like SGS and WQA, which adds a layer of reassurance.  

[Find the best price for Bluevua A-JSJ-LPD-100UV-BMT on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0cnpmrfxs/)  

**Convenient Countertop Design with No Plumbing Required**  
The countertop installation is an absolute lifesaver. I‚Äôm not exactly the most DIY-savvy person, and the thought of installing a complex under-sink system gives me nightmares. But this filter? Plug it in, fill the carafe, and you‚Äôre ready to go. The borosilicate glass carafe stands out because it avoids the typical pitfalls of plastic containers (and secondary pollution). While I usually dread dealing with over-complicated tech, this felt more like setting up a coffee maker than a water filtration system. It‚Äôs user-friendly and looks elegant sitting on my kitchen counter.  

**Energy-Saving and Environmentally Thoughtful**  
Another highlight is its power-saving and water-saving modes. The system automatically goes into standby mode when not in use, cutting back on unnecessary energy consumption. Even more impressive is the 2:1 pure-to-drain water ratio. While many RO systems are wasteful, this one saves the excess water for other uses around the house, an approach that feels sustainable to me. It‚Äôs relieving to know that I‚Äôm reducing waste while getting high-quality water.  

**Durable Filters and Real-Time Monitoring**  
I‚Äôm someone who tends to forget maintenance for gadgets, so the filter life monitor on this product is a lifesaver. The filters last between 12-24 months; that‚Äôs up to two years of pure drinking water before needing replacements. The digital display tracks filter status and water quality, making it easy to monitor everything without having to guess. I‚Äôve checked it repeatedly, and the convenience is undeniable. Other systems I‚Äôve owned couldn't compare to the simplicity of this setup.  

**Favorable Aspects**  
- The six-stage filtration system delivers exceptional water purity and great taste.  
- Effortless setup and compact design fit any modern kitchen.  
- The glass carafe reduces environmental impact and is easy to clean.  
- It includes an energy-saving mode and an outstanding water saving ratio.  

**Caveats**  
- Weighing over 23 lbs, it‚Äôs not the most portable option out there.  
- The maximum flow rate of 0.26 liters per minute might feel slow for larger households.  

**Product Competitors**  
I‚Äôve compared the Bluevua RO System to some other popular products, like the AquaTru and the APEC Water System. While AquaTru also offers a compact countertop design, it doesn‚Äôt have the remineralization feature or a glass carafe, which makes the Bluevua stand out in terms of water quality and sustainability. On the other hand, APEC‚Äôs under-sink systems have higher output and water flow, but they lose points for their effort-intensive installation process. If maintaining portability and eco-consciousness matter to you, Bluevua wins in that department, though it may not be ideal for heavy-duty water needs.  

**Quality for Price**  
Considering everything packed into this system, from the advanced filtration to its sustainable features, I‚Äôd argue that it offers solid value for money. RO systems can range from affordable to very high-end, but this strikes a healthy balance by delivering premium water quality at home without a massive price tag. It may not be the lowest-priced one out there, but its functionality and design make it worth shelling out for.

Under $500 there are a ton of options ‚Äî espresso, pour-over, French press ‚Äî but after reading reviews, Reddit threads, and coffee blogs, these are the ones that stood out the most:

[Baratza Virtuoso+](https://reviewriches.com/best-coffee-grinder-to-buy-under-500/#1) A rock-solid grinder for anyone who wants consistent results across drip, pour-over, and French press. The conical burrs are durable and deliver uniform grounds every time. I love the digital timer‚Äîit makes dosing much easier and accurate. It‚Äôs not the best for espresso, but for filter brews it really shines. Definitely feels like a grinder built to last years.

[Breville Smart Grinder Pro](https://reviewriches.com/best-coffee-grinder-to-buy-under-500/#2) Probably the most versatile option under $500 with its 60 grind settings. The LCD interface makes adjustments super intuitive, and the dose control is great if you switch brew sizes often. I‚Äôve found it works well across espresso, drip, and French press. The burrs are reliable, though the overall build feels a bit plasticky compared to others. Still, for daily home use it‚Äôs a very solid pick.

[Eureka Mignon Silenzio](https://reviewriches.com/best-coffee-grinder-to-buy-under-500/#3) If you‚Äôre into espresso, this one‚Äôs a gem‚Äîsuper quiet, compact, and very precise. The stepless adjustment lets you dial in shots perfectly, something many grinders at this price struggle with. It feels really premium in hand, and the flat burrs give a clean, balanced taste. On the downside, it‚Äôs not great for coarse grinds like French press. But for espresso-focused setups, it‚Äôs hard to beat.

[Fellow Ode (Gen 2)](https://reviewriches.com/best-coffee-grinder-to-buy-under-500/#4) This grinder is basically made for filter coffee fans. The flat burrs give such uniform, fluffy grounds that really elevate pour-over and French press. It‚Äôs compact, minimal, and honestly one of the most stylish grinders out there. Retention is very low, so you waste less coffee. Just don‚Äôt buy it if you need espresso‚Äîit‚Äôs not designed for that.

[Capresso Infinity](https://reviewriches.com/best-coffee-grinder-to-buy-under-500/#5) A great entry-level burr grinder for beginners who don‚Äôt want to spend too much. The conical burrs are surprisingly consistent for the price, and it‚Äôs straightforward to use. Cleaning is simple, and it doesn‚Äôt take up much counter space. It does grind slower and doesn‚Äôt have the fine-tuning of higher-end models. Still, if you just want reliable daily coffee without fuss, this gets the job done.

I‚Äôm currently debating between the **Breville Smart Grinder Pro** (very versatile, easy to use) and the **Eureka Mignon Silenzio** (espresso-focused, quiet, and more premium).

Has anyone here used these long-term? Is it worth paying extra for a more espresso-specific grinder like the Eureka, or should I stick with a versatile one like the Breville?",1,1756653327.0,u_its-creator1036,0,1.0,False
1n4xbum,https://i.redd.it/st8ankd8gdmf1.jpeg,SCD breakfast,"This is my standard SCD breakfast. I eat it 4-6 days a week when not traveling. Prep time 5 minutes. Quite filling. 

2 poached eggs with salt, pepper, hot sauce
122 grams drained black beans
112 grams spinach 
2 cups of coffee, 20g Vital Proteins marine collagen, 4 fl oz oat milk 

Total calories: 454 of 1600 daily (deficit 200-300 below estimated daily expenditure). I aim for 156g of daily protein. 

Macros: 45g protein, 40g (slow) carbs, 14g fat

The oat milk (68 cal, 1g protein) is a minor SCD deviation for taste and skippable if you prefer black coffee. Flavorless Vital Proteins sources from cod, good for joints/nails etc. 

If the meal is too heavy reduce the volume of beans/spinach by about a third and you‚Äôll still hit the minimum 30g protein and have more calories for lunch and dinner. 

Eggs are poached via microwave  in this stoneware bowl for 1:30 (may vary): https://a.co/d/4HNW0Nb

The eggs are 20g protein. Other proteins can be substituted: 200g smoked salmon or 100g tuna, for example, or other meat as preference allows. Tofu also works. 

I drink 8-12 oz water right when I wake up as well. 

I use the MacroFactor app and food database, but that is not necessary for slow carb diet. I use it because of occasional deviations from the official diet and to track protein in particular to avoid excessive muscle loss. 

The beauty of SCD is to lose weight you don‚Äôt have to count macros or calories, as I did here; just avoid the restricted foods and weigh yourself, then eat less if the scale doesn‚Äôt move. Losing up to 1lb a week (measured the morning of cheat day) has been my average. Some weeks it goes up, due to water weight or muscle growth. 

Your calorie needs /daily expenditure will be different than mine based on body size and daily activity. I am 63yo male, 160lbs, 5-11. I have cut 40 lbs, most of it fat, since late 2024.

Of course tons of other bits and bobs and coffee and tea and gum and matches.

1n4x8wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n4x8wj/every_time_i_die_i_wake_up_as_someone_new/,Every Time I Die I Wake Up As Someone New,"What happens when you die? Centuries have been spent arguing and convincing others the truth. I don‚Äôt know if I have everyone‚Äôs answer. But I have my truth.

With every death, before came life. My name is Emma. I‚Äôm 22 years old, and for the first time, I finally felt like life was starting to make sense. I‚Äôd just moved out of my parents‚Äô house into a small but cozy apartment with my boyfriend, Ryan.

We lived each day one step closer to a life we hadn‚Äôt even lived yet but enjoyed the journey. I worked part time at a coffee shop while finishing school to become a child psychologist. I could see the finish line‚Äîour wedding day, our first little house and, the German shepherd we promised each other once we had a yard. I could almost hear the bark echoing through the hallways of a life we hadn‚Äôt built yet. Everything was clear.

But I never saw the car that ran the red light. I remember the screeching of tires and smell of iron as my perfect little world went dark.

The next thing I knew, I was in a hospital bed, the dull beep of the monitor confirming to me my heartbeat was still present. My body was wrong, dead weight, limp, a sack of wet sand refusing to obey. I‚Äôm sure my eyes were open but I could only see in splotches and light. The attempt to speak was futile, I moved my tongue around my mouth and noticed I had lost all my teeth.

Toothless gums replaced my smile. I had worked so hard and withstood years of braces only to have them ripped away from me. My hearing was dulled, almost like I was underwater, I could feel the presence of people around me. I heard the creak of a door open and someone began to speak.

‚ÄúNous sommes √† la fin d‚Äôun tr√®s long parcours.‚Äù

Was that French? I took 3 years in high school. I didn‚Äôt understand all of it, but I heard fin‚Äîthe end. I wasn‚Äôt sure, but the tone said more than the words ever could. Why were they speaking French? I don‚Äôt think anyone from my family spoke French we were as Irish as potatoes and whiskey.

I felt a pressure on my hand as a dip of water landed on my cheek.

‚ÄúOn se reverra, Papa‚Äù A hushed sniffled voice spoke in my ear.

Papa? I tried to look past the blur but I couldn‚Äôt see anything in detail, I was basically blind. I just heard the faint weeping of several around me. As another pressure began on my other hand. I sat like that for what felt like an eternity not able to move or speak or understand truly what was happening around me. I focused on my breathing it was slow and labored. The beeping slowed, the world faded.

I sat behind a desk as the rising sun crept through the high-rise windows. The dystopian cityscape outside was unlike anything I had seen. I grew up in small town Vermont I was used to small brick buildings and colonial- style houses. This was a metropolis, newer than New York, gleaming and sharp.

On the desk sat a nameplate, written in a language I couldn‚Äôt read. My eyes dropped to my body. A tailored business blouse, this wasn‚Äôt me. This wasn‚Äôt my body, my hands were pristine, coated in a red polish on the nails, breasts larger than my own. This wasn‚Äôt me. My body felt fake, stiff as if even my smile had been manufactured.

I pressed closer to the window and realized I was hundreds of stories up. My reflection stared back, beautiful, meticulously mutilated into perfection. Panic surged through me.

What was happening? Where was I? Who am I?

My breathing boiled until it broke into hyperventilation. I threw myself at the glass. It didn‚Äôt break but knocked the air from my chest.

I ran, I ran out of the office and down the hall. I had many people shouting at me perhaps out of concern. I couldn‚Äôt understand a word. I ran and saw an open door that led to a balcony. There were people out there talking and filling the air with smoke and conversation which I could not be a part of. Some of them stopped and gave me a raised eyebrow. I could only let out a nervous laugh. Several people walked up to me, gently laying their hand on me, talking hushed and calm. I just wanted to wake up, this dream had gone on enough.

I took a deep breath and put myself together, the people took a step back and let out a nervous laugh. Once they didn‚Äôt seem as alert, I darted to the edge. I leapt, the ground so far away, the screams of those around me became a distant hum as the air around my free-fall deafened me. It was time to try something, maybe I can make this a lucid dream, I thought about flying flapping my arms. In desperation to take flight. All efforts were futile.

I sank through the sky like an anchor. All time to reflect on what was happening, passed by in a flash as the Earth welcomed me with its solid embrace.

A sharp migraine pulsed through my skull. Machinery roared around me, men shouting over the chaos. Sunlight blazed down‚Äîso bright it felt like a slap after the darkness I‚Äôd just left. Slowly the world came into focus. The acrid mix of sweat and tar stung my nose.

I raised a hand to cover my face and froze. Black-stained leather gloves. I tugged one off. A swollen, hairy hand stared back at me. My arm was thick, darkened by sun and ink, muscles corded where pale skin once was. A bold tattoo stretched across the forearm: Olivia.

Who was Olivia? Why was I hairy, muscular?

This has to be a dream, I thought. I‚Äôll wake up any second. Around me men worked the road, some smoking, some eating their lunches. It was too ordinary, too real. Desperate, I pinched myself. Pain flared.

Panic set in. My chest heaved. My breaths rasped.

A man noticed and jogged over. ‚ÄúHey, Danny. The hell‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúDanny?‚Äù My voice came out deeper, alien. ‚ÄúNo‚ÄîI‚Äôm Emma. Where am I?‚Äù

He frowned, then chuckled uneasily, peering into my eyes. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck? You havin‚Äô a heat stroke or something, buddy?‚Äù

My heart was about to explode out of my chest. I had to wake up any means necessary. I spun my head and saw what could get the job done. A bit brutal but it was the first thing I saw. A steamroller.

I stepped away from the man and ran full speed ahead. It rolled slowly and I acted fast. Some men started to yell, I‚Äôm sure they didn‚Äôt know what I was planning. I slid trying to jam myself under the giant wheel. I managed to get my right arm and shoulder wedged. As the flattener crawled forward I felt the evisceration of bone as it turned to dust. It felt like my body was being engulfed in the presence of the sun. I could hear the screams of men as the machine hissed, it slowly rolled an inch and pressed onto my skull which caved quickly. Cracking like a walnut shell.

Dust and sand filled my eyes as the ricocheting of bullets whizzed past The buildings around me were sheet metal, the streets around me were drenched in blood and bodies. I heard shouts to my left, my ears were ringing. I had a gun in my hands. Not my hands. I cried. I couldn‚Äôt take this. I had the easiest way to end it right in my palms but I couldn‚Äôt. Too much was happening so fast. I heard shots very close. The door to the room I was sitting in was kicked open. I threw my hands up.

I gasped as my hands were still in front of me. They were so small. Pudgy little fingers. I was a child, toddler perhaps. The gun fire was gone. The only noise was the ambient sound of the ceiling fan. I laid my head back on a little lamb stuffed animal. I attempted to move my legs, I could but they were weak, I don‚Äôt think they could hold me up. I wasn‚Äôt just a toddler, I was a baby. I might as well act the part, I bawled my eyes out. Screaming at the top of my little lungs. Soon a woman walked into the room, plump, unkempt red hair.

‚ÄúOoh my little one, come here‚Äù She spoke in a soothing British accent.

She picked me up and started to rock me. It calmed me. I collected my thoughts. What was I supposed to do. The idea this was a dream started to fade. She hummed and rubbed my back. But I wasn‚Äôt going to just go to sleep I needed answers.

I tried my best to talk, it didn‚Äôt come naturally, like speaking through taffy. Even if I could talk, what would I say? I looked around my environment. Statues and paintings of Jesus and the Virgin Mary surrounded me. The room was charming, stacks of envelopes covered kitchen table. Among the religious imagery was several photos of a man. Thinning hair and a bushy mustache. Square thin framed glasses sat. There were a couple photos of the lady and him sat on a mantle. A wooden sign with the words ‚ÄúForever in my heart, in the arms of the lord‚Äù carved and painted into it.

‚ÄúYou see daddy?‚Äù  She noticed my glare, and stepped to the picture.

I struggled to speak as my muscles were underdeveloped. Like a stroke victim attempting communication, I knew what I wanted to say but my mouth made me struggle. Would her precious child‚Äôs first words be a plea for help?

I could only stay here for so long, I can‚Äôt wait to grow, my life‚Äôs experience crammed into this fresh spawn. The moving of my mouth and tongue took surgical precision. The mother took notice. And awed in glee with the anticipation of the long awaited voice of their child. Gargles and gasps left my little mouth in a struggled desperation to be heard. She gawked with glee, guiding my attempts to mama, or papa. ‚ÄúH-He‚Äù I could do this. Walking on undeveloped muscles would be nearly impossible but talking. I could make this work. I pushed out the beginning but the rolling of the L was a struggle. The poor mother began to speak with me. ‚ÄúHello, hello‚Äù her smile was almost ripping, she couldn‚Äôt possibly smile any wider. I stopped my attempts and went quiet. She was still smiling but it began to shrink. The warmth never left her eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got so much to say don‚Äôt ya‚Äù She looked at me with only the love of a mother could give to a child. The mother carried me to a crib. A wonderful hand carved wooden frame. A quaint small cross carved into the head of it and covered in a soft powdered blue paint. I couldn‚Äôt do much besides look up. She gave me a kiss on the crown of my head. The mother left me in the room, not before spinning a music box and leaving the sweet, crackling sound. Left in the isolation of my squishy, weak body. Left to ponder what my world had become. Yesterday I was in the midst of bliss. The blur of the accident was still present, I‚Äôm cognizant enough to remember, but the hospital, the skyscraper, road construction. Trying to make sense of this hodgepodge of consciousness. Speech did not come naturally but I had my goal. I spent the night fighting my vocals. But I was making progress.

The night dragged like a fever dream. I wrestled with the mush of my throat and tongue, shaping noises, learning how to steer the muscles like oars through syrup coaxing vowels to shape. Every grunt, every accidental syllable was progress. My mind was aflame with clarity, but my body was still a cage.

When she came to me again, arms smelling faintly of lavender soap and stale coffee, her face beamed with expectation. She brushed a curl of red hair behind her ear and whispered in her soft, British lilt:

‚ÄúCome on then, my sweet boy. Let mama hear you. Say a word for me.‚Äù

I tried. Air hissed and stuttered out of me, a wet gargle, but I pressed harder. ‚ÄúMa‚Ä¶‚Äù

Her eyes shone. ‚ÄúYes! Yes, clever lad!‚Äù

I shook my head weakly, furious at the misinterpretation. Again I forced the sound out, this time dragging my vocal cords like knives across stone. ‚ÄúMa‚Ä¶ ma‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶ help.‚Äù

Her smile faltered. She blinked at me, uncomprehending, until the syllables stacked on top of each other, crude but clear. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶na‚Ä¶.you‚Ä¶.baby.‚Äù

She froze. The joy drained from her face in an instant. Her arms stiffened around me, as though I had turned to ice in her grasp.

I pressed on, desperate to make her understand. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ no baby. I‚Ä¶ Emma. I‚Ä¶ .‚Äù

Each word came jagged, broken, stitched together by sheer will. I could hear how wrong it sounded‚Äîlike a drunkard‚Äôs confession slurred through rotten teeth‚Äîbut the truth was there, naked and damning.

Her lips quivered. She backed away from me, clutching me to her chest, not out of love but like someone holding a venomous serpent.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ no, that‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ My boy. My boy can‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù Her eyes darted to the mantle where her husband‚Äôs photograph sat beneath the wooden sign. ‚ÄúThis is a trick. A wicked trick.‚Äù

I sobbed, coughing against the effort, but I forced the words again. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ acciden. Car‚Ä¶ light. Hospital‚Ä¶ fan‚Ä¶no dead.‚Äù

She shrieked, dropping me back into the crib. Her hands clutched her temples as though the words themselves were nails being driven into her skull.

‚ÄúStop! Stop it, don‚Äôt you say those things. Not in my house, not in front of the Lord!‚Äù

Her gaze snapped back to me, and for the first time, the love in her eyes was gone. In its place: raw terror, fevered conviction. She saw not her child, but an intruder wearing his skin.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not him‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre not my baby. You‚Äôre the Devil himself, crawling in through the mouth of an innocent!‚Äù

I cried out again, begging through gasps, ‚ÄúNo devil‚Ä¶ me. Emma. Please. Help me‚Ä¶ please.‚Äù

Her body shook with sobs, her hands wringing at her nightgown until the seams nearly tore. Then something hardened in her, a grim resolve twisting her grief into madness.

She staggered toward the crib, whispering as though in prayer: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let you have him. I won‚Äôt let you take my sweet boy. Better the Lord have him than you.‚Äù

I screamed, voice breaking into a desperate litany of truth‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ no baby! I‚Ä¶ car crash‚Ä¶ Emma! No devil, no devil, no‚Äî‚Äù

The pillow came down, blotting out my vision. The smell of stale linen filled my lungs as her weight pressed down. My tiny fists beat helplessly against the suffocating fabric, every word I‚Äôd fought to claw from this body smothered back into silence.

Above me, I heard her sobbing prayers, fractured and wild: ‚ÄúForgive me, Lord, forgive me‚Ä¶ take him home, take him home‚Ä¶‚Äù

The music box still played on the dresser, its tinny, crackling notes winding down, note by note, until there was nothing left but darkness.

I sat at a kitchen table, surrounded by people. A woman, and two children, a young girl probably around 5, and a boy about 9. The little girl sat in braids, her gapped smile widened as she took a large bite of her food. The boy wore jersey, I think it‚Äôs a Denver Broncos jersey. I must be in America then.

‚ÄúTodd are you okay dear? You look a bit pale.‚Äù The woman said with a look of worry on her face

‚ÄúHe must have wanted pizza too! Huh dad?‚Äù The boy spoke with a rowdiness only achievable by someone his age.

‚ÄúI love the macaroni!‚Äù Said the girl smiling so bright.

‚ÄúYeah of course you do that‚Äôs all you ever eat!‚Äù Exclaimed the boy

Their bickering continued, I scooted my chair back ‚ÄúI‚Äôve gotta go to the bathroom,‚Äù I went to excuse myself.

I don‚Äôt know where the bathroom is. This was a different panic, not one of desperation to use it, but that if this is my house, I should know where it is. I tried to look as confident as I could cautiously looking down the hallway to see if I could spot it out if I had to open door. Unfortunately I had to play the guessing game. I tried the first on the left, that must have been the boys. A bunch of sports memorabilia and posters of players hung on his walls. I closed and tried the next, thank god. I locked myself in the room. I looked in the mirror, in disbelief, and disgust. I was a man, late 30s or early 40s, I had a small gut and stood about 6 foot. I had glasses and a short trimmed beard. My hair was covered by a cap. I stared at the logo on it, I have no clue what team that is.

I sat on the toilet. Trying to wrap my head around any of this. I checked my pockets and found a wallet, and my phone. His name is Todd, he‚Äôs 39 years old. He‚Äôs from Colorado. So I know the bare minimum of information about him, or me. I don‚Äôt know the kids‚Äô names, I don‚Äôt know the wife‚Äôs. I pulled his phone out, no Face ID. I don‚Äôt know the password. How do I fake any of this. I‚Äôm not Todd father of 2, I‚Äôm Emma. How is any of this possible, what is happening? Am I dreaming? I remember I was driving, did I got into an accident that‚Äôs I know. Maybe I‚Äôm in a coma, just a long sleep. As I gaze into the face of this middle aged man. Every movement uncanny as the reflection of this man, mirrored every single action. Of course it was mirrored, it was me after all. The adrenaline began to subside as I finally felt a form of calm. I took a long good look at myself. Relatively in shape. Balding on top. The crease of my eyes had lines beginning to form. A subtle engraving of smile marks on my cheeks. The misery that came with the realization brought me to tears. Was I any more than a puppeteer? The man I am has so many happy memories with a family that adores him and I hijack it and take over. Left destitute in the prison of my own conscience locked in the body of someone new. And what‚Äôs left for Todd? Is he snuffed out of existence just like that or is he forced to rot in the recesses of his mind as I take his body for a joy ride. I have no love for his wife, or kids. Love isn‚Äôt something you can fake at least not to this level. I began to heave as the stress came back full force.

‚ÄúYou alright honey?‚Äù A sweetness laced her voice as to mask the concern.

‚ÄúYeah, yeah‚Ä¶ just an upset stomach, I‚Äôll be back in a moment.‚Äù The dread of communication with this family was foreboding, they weren‚Äôt monsters nor creatures of the night. But simply a family. One that loved, laughed and cared for each other, deep rooted grounded in a town I didn‚Äôt know. Past experiences and core memories erased from this vessel. I wanted to be dreaming, but the realness, the detail and clarity in my surroundings made me come to terms with this being something else entirely. I couldn‚Äôt hide forever. I would have to confront them, and act as best I could, but how could I act like someone who I‚Äôve never met, let alone heard of. Was he witty? Quiet?  Loud and proud? I would have to see how it all played out.

I cleaned myself up and took a deep breath and stepped back into the dining room. Pictures of Christmas‚Äô past and presumed relatives lined the wall. As the children sat with their plates almost empty.

Their laughter filling the room in a twist of jolly bursts and giggles. A goal I had wished to achieve, a happy healthy family, enjoying time together.

The pit in my stomach twisted with the ravenous gnaw of a stray dog. The room filled with joy, my heart shattered in the wake. I was a thief of happiness, a thief of life.

My ears rang from the conversations around me like I had just landed on Normandy. I muted everything around me as I stared at  the family portrait that hung over the doorway of the dining rooms. The face of the man was staring back at me.

‚ÄúTodd‚Ä¶.Todd‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.TODD‚Äù The shrilled screech cut through my haze. I darted my head to the source, the wife.

‚ÄúHoney, where is your mind? Your son is trying to talk to you, are you alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost daddy.‚Äù The little girl looked up at me with fear, I can assume I was pale, I felt the sweat running down my forehead. When not fixated on the photo my eyes darted around like cornered prey.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, sweetie, I‚Äôm sorry daddy just isn‚Äôt feeling good.‚Äù I showed a soft smile to her. I wiped the sweat from my brow.

‚ÄúSorry guys, I‚Äôm gonna go lay down.‚Äù I just had to get away. I needed answers.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm all groggy, babe what‚Äôs my phone password?‚Äù I just needed to get  into my phone and I could find something

‚ÄúWhat? It‚Äôs our anniversary year isn‚Äôt it.‚Äù She raised a brow at me, perhaps thinking I changed it for some reason. I didn‚Äôt say anything I sat looking back in forth. ‚ÄúWe just had our ten year? Todd are you okay, seriously you‚Äôre scaring me‚Äù She started to get visibly upset. The tension in the room was suffocating. The kids were hushed looking at their parents nearly as confused as I was.

I fumbled for words and haphazardly abandoned my seat at the table. Heading back to the bathroom. I pulled my phone out of my pocket and typed in 2015, unlocked. I let out a sigh of relief.

Who do I call? The decision was daunting. I could call Ryan but what do I say?

‚ÄúHey Ryan it‚Äôs Emma I know I sound like I‚Äôm a grown man, that‚Äôs because I am but it‚Äôs still me! Love you so much.‚Äù

Who was I kidding that would be a nightmare. Maybe it would be the ultimate test of if personality prevails. I could try my parents, if I know what only I could know maybe I could convince them.

I tried what made sense in the moment, I called my cellphone. It didn‚Äôt even ring, straight to voicemail. I heard my voice. ‚ÄúHey this is Emma! Sorry I missed your call, I‚Äôll call back soon, bye!‚Äù My voice, full of energy. I missed it.

I hung up and held back tears the best I could.

I should have slowed down but everything, every death, the last breath of a life to the first as someone new was one continuous line of consciousness for me. I didn‚Äôt have time to reflect.

I took a deep breath in, I‚Äôll call my dad. My fingers rattled as I put his number in. With an exhale, I called.

The rings crawled its way from the phone and echoed in my ear. Anxiety flooded through my bloodstream. I couldn‚Äôt do this.

A hollow voice came through the speaker. ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù my father forced out.

Tears welled in my eyes. ‚ÄúHey, Scott,‚Äù I managed to squeak.

‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù His voice was thin, confused.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶‚Äù The rest of my life hinged on a few words, but they stuck like stone in my throat. If I couldn‚Äôt say it, maybe I could ask instead. ‚ÄúEmma? How‚Äôs she doing?‚Äù

I already knew the answer. I‚Äôd killed myself a handful of times today, stumbling between lives, sitting now in the purgatory of suburbia. I just needed to hear it.

‚ÄúDead. My baby girl is dead.‚Äù His voice broke, and he wept.

I wanted to comfort him, tell him I was here. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your Ember,‚Äù I cried. ‚ÄúYour little light.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù His sobs faltered. Realization crept in.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me, Dad. I know it sounds crazy but‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou rotten son of a bitch. What kind of sick game is this?‚Äù His grief twisted to venom. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúI hope one day you feel the loss I feel. And when you do, I‚Äôll call you up and laugh in your face. You fucking prick!‚Äù

The line went dead.

The silence pressed heavier than his words. I had lost something no, everything: my family, my love, my future, my life. All I could do now was watch from the sidelines.

The next couple days were spent as a
chameleon, good or bad I couldn‚Äôt really tell, the kids acted like they were talking to a stranger. I guess they were. The wife seemed suspicious as well, obviously but luckily she didn‚Äôt push too much.

I had to call into work, seems as though Todd was a Biomechanical Engineer at a nearby hospital. I had to play sick, but not too sick to be sent to his place of employment.

I spent those days reminiscing, and digging.

Marketing Executive Dies in Apparent Fall from Seoul High-Rise

‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîSeoul, South Korea ‚Äî A senior business executive died Tuesday morning

The victim, a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) for a multinational corporation [name redacted], had reportedly been acting normally throughout the day before a sudden, unexplained outburst. Witnesses say she began sprinting erratically through the office space before running toward a balcony and leaping from an upper floor.

Colleagues told investigators that she had shown no clear warning signs of distress prior to the episode. Police have stated that foul play is not suspected and are treating the case as an apparent suicide, though the sudden nature of her behavior has raised questions.

In a brief statement, the company expressed condolences: ‚ÄúWe are deeply saddened by this tragic event. Our thoughts are with the family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.‚Äù‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Worker Dies in Rural Construction Accident

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed the incident and stated that foul play is not suspected. Investigators are reviewing safety conditions at the site and interviewing coworkers to determine the circumstances leading up to the accident.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Mother in Bakewell Hospitalized After Postpartum Episode

‚Äî‚ÄîBakewell, England ‚Äî Local authorities confirmed that a single mother in Bakewell was taken into care this week following a severe postpartum stress episode.

Perpetrator states she became convinced her 9-month-old child was possessed. She had contacted authorities after taking the life of the infant.

The woman was transported to a nearby hospital for evaluation and is receiving ongoing medical and psychiatric support.

Health officials note that postpartum stress and related conditions remain a serious concern for new parents. Resources and support services are available for families across Derbyshire.

There it all was my actions written into harsh new articles. The theories were wrong. It was me.

I‚Äôm stuck I don‚Äôt know what to do. Todd had 39 years of memories experiences life and I just came in and hijacked it. I don‚Äôt know anything about his wife anything about our kids? I can only fake it for so long until I don‚Äôt know, but I can‚Äôt kill him. It‚Äôs ruining a family.

It took me too long to realize that I killed somebody‚Äôs child.

I killed somebody who worked their whole life to get to the position that they‚Äôre in devastated and their family.

I killed a hard-working man potentially had family that wonder why he ended up doing what he did.

And I took away the ability for a Father to hear his family weep and tell them that it‚Äôs okay for him to move on I didn‚Äôt ask for any of this.

August was full of inspiring success stories in our community. Real people shared how they shifted their state, held the faith, and manifested their SPs (and in some cases, completely transformed their lives).

Read through these highlights, notice the patterns, the mindset shifts, and the persistence. And most importantly, let it remind you: **your story isn‚Äôt over**.



**SP Success Story #1**: [**‚ÄúHe Finally Did a Full 180‚Äù**](https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1mhamdb/he_is_finally_mine/)

This OP‚Äôs journey spanned over a year of spirals, robotic affirmations, SATS, subliminals, scripting, and even spells ‚Äî all while being consumed by anxiety and the fear of losing her SP. After hitting rock bottom and finally focusing on herself, she let go completely. Just weeks later, he messaged her, came back transformed, and began treating her exactly as she had affirmed all along.  
  
***‚ÄúI remember when I wrote down robotic affirmations and scripted, I wrote ‚Äòhe treats me like a queen‚Äô and word for word, no kidding, he constantly calls me his queen now.‚Äù***

What makes this story so powerful is the **contrast between the chaos and the calm**. When she shifted from obsession to genuine self-focus, her SP reflected that change back almost instantly. Now they‚Äôre in a happy relationship, and she emphasizes that your SP **adds to your life, not completes it.**  
  
***‚ÄúKeep working on yourself, and do not operate from a place of lack ‚Äî your SP ADDS to your life, not COMPLETES it.‚Äù***



**SP Success Story #2:** [**From ‚ÄúBorn for Bad Luck‚Äù ‚Üí A Life of Overflow**](https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1mdr32z/it_all_worked_out_how_i_manifested_everything_i/) 

This storyteller went from unstable jobs, 8+ years of failed relationships, and believing she was cursed with bad luck, to manifesting her dream partner, remote income streams, skyrocketing YouTube growth, and the healthiest version of herself.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Reclaimed daydreaming as power:** She reframed her old ‚Äúdaydreamer‚Äù habit (once shamed by family) into her strongest visualization tool. Books, movies, and letting her imagination run free made her visualizations vivid and real.
* **Stopped forcing, started believing:** Whenever she tried too hard (‚ÄúI need money now!‚Äù), nothing moved. When she worked on her deep belief that she was unlucky and began rewriting small wins daily (good coffee, sunshine, cute dogs), everything shifted.
* **Snowball effect of gratitude:** Once she stopped waiting for *big wins* and started appreciating daily blessings, the bigger manifestations flowed in ‚Äî love, freedom, health, and abundance.

**Standout Quote:** *‚ÄúManifesting is literally working with energy. It makes no exemptions who to serve. The only one who does‚Ä¶ is you.‚Äù*



**SP Success Story #3**: [**‚ÄúHe Broke No Contact and Came Back‚Äù**](https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1mcxerb/success_story_about_my_sp_breaking_no_contact_and/)

This one is for anyone stuck in no contact and doubting if it‚Äôs really possible. OP‚Äôs ex (‚ÄúM‚Äù) broke up with her, got into other talking stages, and even another relationship, but she persisted and flipped the story. She affirmed he‚Äôd reach out by her birthday ‚Äî and he did exactly that, breaking silence the very same day.

**Key Takeaways:**

* She stopped wallowing in the old story and instead set a specific intention: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll text me on my birthday.‚Äù
* Even when it looked like the 3D contradicted her (him dating someone else), she shifted into assuming he wanted her and they were in a healthy relationship.
* Within weeks, not only did he break contact, but he started pursuing her ‚Äî daily calls, constant texts, date planning, even coordinating outfits and taking the lead.

**Standout Quote:** *‚ÄúI told myself that he‚Äôd break no contact by my birthday. And guess what he did?? I waited all day, and he finally texted me happy birthday that evening. I. Was. Shook.‚Äù*

**Core Lesson:**  
When you decide on your outcome and stop obsessively checking the 3D for proof, reality bends to meet your assumption. No contact isn‚Äôt an ending; it‚Äôs often the clearing before the breakthrough.

  
**SP Success Story #4:** [**‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Back in Less Than 3 Weeks‚Äù**](https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1n1qpec/shes_back_in_less_than_3_weeks/)

This story shows how quickly things can shift when persistence meets alignment ‚Äî even after a breakup and being blocked everywhere.

**Main Takeaway:**  
He stayed disciplined with SATS (hearing her regret in her own voice) and scripting, while refusing to collapse into chasing energy. Within 2 weeks, she unblocked him, reached out, and mirrored back *the exact words* he had imagined her saying.

**Details:**

* Breakup on Aug 9 ‚Üí blocked everywhere ‚Üí he chose calm over spiraling.
* By Aug 15, he joined a free coaching trial and doubled down on old practices: scripting + SATS.
* Same day: She unblocked him on Instagram (first movement).
* Aug 21: She texted (first contact), and later admitted she *missed him*.
* Aug 23: They met in person, she apologized, admitted regret, and literally said the exact words he had planted in SATS: *‚ÄúI felt stupid for doing it.‚Äù*
* By the next day, they were back together.

**Standout Quote:**  
*‚ÄúShe was REGRETFUL AND FELT STUPID FOR DOING IT ‚Äî the exact words I planned!!‚Äù*  


**SP Success Story #5**: [**‚ÄúSuccess in Just One Week‚Äù**](https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1mlijvp/success_story_in_one_week/)

This story shows how fast things can shift when you refuse to chase, hold your vision steady, and balance your emotions even when fear creeps in.

**Main Takeaway:**  
She set *clear goals* (seeing him that weekend + him asking her to be his girlfriend again), stuck to affirmations and self-concept work despite doubts, and both goals unfolded *exactly* as she had declared, flowers included.

**Details:**

* Breakup happened just one week prior. He said they should *never* be together again.
* Instead of spiraling, she reframed instantly: *‚ÄúYou‚Äôll miss me and realize how much you need me.‚Äù*
* Focused on affirmations, scripting, and working on her abandonment issues while resisting the urge to text.
* Within days, he was calling every night, saying he missed her, showing constant movement.
* She set 2 goals: (1) see him that weekend, (2) become official again. Both manifested.
* Even added a playful assumption: *‚ÄúHe‚Äôll have flowers waiting for me.‚Äù* He did.
* At the end of their date, he asked her to be his girlfriend again, calling her *‚Äúthe love of his life.‚Äù*

**Standout Quote:**  
*‚ÄúDoubts don‚Äôt kill your manifestation as long as you continue living in the end.‚Äù*



**SP Success Story #6**: [**‚ÄúManifested My SP in Less Than a Day‚Äù**](https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1n0pw2e/i_manifested_my_sp_in_less_than_a_day_inside/)

This one shows how quickly things can move when you *drop the pressure*, live from your self-concept, and approach your desire with lightness instead of obsession.

**Main Takeaway:**  
When she stopped clinging to her old SP ‚ÄúR‚Äù and instead leaned into her own magnetic self-concept, a *new SP (‚ÄúA‚Äù)* entered her life instantly ‚Äî showing her what effortless alignment looks like.

**Details:**

* After working on her self-concept (feeling magnetic, special, unique), life started to feel lighter.
* Out of nowhere, her old high school crush ‚ÄúA‚Äù followed her on Instagram.
* Instead of obsessing, she casually fantasized about him taking her to a new restaurant that had just opened.
* Within minutes of imagining it, he **DM‚Äôd her out of the blue**, saying he had seen her recently.
* Now, he‚Äôs texting her constantly, sending 100+ messages at a time, saying good morning/good night, and making plans to meet.
* All of this unfolded in **less than 24 hours**.

**Inside Reflections:**

* With her old SP ‚ÄúR,‚Äù she had obsessed, waited, checked 3D, and spiraled. That kept her in lack.
* With ‚ÄúA,‚Äù she didn‚Äôt overthink or chase; she simply imagined and allowed.
* The ease with ‚ÄúA‚Äù revealed that the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù was never the techniques but the *state of being she operated from.*

 **Standout Quote:**  
*‚ÄúManifesting ‚ÄòA‚Äô was so easy, meanwhile manifesting ‚ÄòR‚Äô seemed impossible‚Ä¶ with ‚ÄòA‚Äô I don‚Äôt even expect anything from him and he does everything I wanted ‚ÄòR‚Äô to do.‚Äù*

  
**SP Success Story #7:** [**‚ÄúChanged Behavior in an SP (Proof It Works!)‚Äù**](https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1mpktp8/changed_behavior_in_an_sp/)

This story shows how powerful it can be to test the Law in ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù ways ‚Äî and how those shifts can build confidence to go after bigger desires like a romantic SP.

**Main Takeaway:**  
Even when someone seems stubborn or unlikely to change, your assumption about them overrides the 3D. When she detached and expected an apology + changed behavior, her former friend showed up exactly like that.

**Details:**

* After a toxic fallout with a friend, she set the intention for an apology and new behavior.
* She didn‚Äôt script or overdo techniques ‚Äî she simply detached and trusted.
* Despite thinking her friend was too stubborn, movement happened almost immediately.
* Her friend came back with an apology, showed signs of genuine self-work, and wanted to repair the friendship.
* This gave her undeniable proof that if she could shift someone ‚Äúimpossible,‚Äù she could also manifest changes with her romantic SP.

**Standout Quote:**  
*‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the last person I would expect this change from‚Ä¶ but the second I set the intention, movement happened behind the scenes and now she‚Äôs showing up exactly as I said she would.‚Äù*

  
**SP Success Story #8:** [**‚ÄúManifested My Crush Using a Vision Board‚Äù**](https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1mocrzw/manifested_my_crush_using_a_vision_board/)

Sometimes the simplest ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù is what convinces you the Law is real. This story shows how playfulness and natural detachment create powerful results.

**Main Takeaway:**  
She created a vision board with her crush‚Äôs photo and affirmations, then let it go. Within three weeks, movement showed up exactly as imagined: he reached out, pursued her, and started chasing.

**Details:**

* After leaving an abusive relationship, she was skeptical about love but curious about the Law.
* She chose her crush (her ex‚Äôs best friend) as an ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù and created a Pinterest vision board pairing their photos with romantic affirmations.
* Importantly, she *forgot about it* and stayed busy with her work, embodying natural detachment.
* Just three weeks later, they met through mutual friends, he added her to his private Instagram, started texting her daily, and began chasing her, exactly as her affirmation stated.
* She‚Äôs not labeling it ‚Äúdone‚Äù yet, but is amazed by how quickly it unfolded.

**Standout Quote:**  
*‚ÄúI had put an affirmation that he would chase me. So far he is chasing me and putting effort in being around.‚Äù*



If these stories show anything, it‚Äôs that your current 3D doesn‚Äôt matter. Whether you‚Äôve been blocked, ghosted, stuck in no contact, or feel like you‚Äôre out of chances, movement is always happening behind the scenes.

So read these, take what resonates, and remind yourself: if they can do it, so can you.

Since I don‚Äôt have much time otherwise and no social circle in which I can meet people. I started cold approaching here and there.

I would say I look decent, I am 24 years old 5‚Äò7 tall, and I can talk to woman decently, nothing too crazy. From I would say 12 approaches in total I got like 6 numbers. Some were not interested, and some had boyfriends. From those 6 numbers almost everyone either ghosted me or rejected me after like the first 3 messages. Yesterday for example I approached a cute girl. She made like the craziest Eye contact me the whole time. She gave me her number. I will post in the text conversation so you can tell me what went wrong:

Me: Hey hey Is that the nice girl from Austria or am I texting a 50-year-old Indian guy right now? üëÄ

Her: Yes üôåüèºüòäüòä Just putting my phone away and letting the evening fade away. üåù

Next morning Me: Sounds cool, hope you had a relaxing evening:) By the way, have you ever been to the best caf√© in Cologne?

Her: Yes üòä, which one is it?

Me: The Ain caf√© on Venloer Street üòå What do you think about getting a coffee there next week?

Her: Oh, I love that place, especially the Tea there ü§§ I somehow feel like I don't want to meet someone currently. Not in the mood for a date right now. ‚ò∫Ô∏èBut we'll definitely see each other at the gym from time to time ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Me: Yeah sure:)

I want to do a contest that focuses on creativity. Sometimes there is a void that only making things can help fill, and there are so many creative people here!

Here's what you do: answer the questions below. You are also welcome to show something you have made too. Then just respond with something uplifting to someone else's comment. Keep your answers kind of short please, as I don't have a big attention span.

**For example, my answer:**

   1. I recently picked up watercoloring 

   2. I've wanted to do it for a long time because it looked so pretty, and soothing, and I only dabbled with in the past, but have found it is a very relaxing way to process grief. It also feels easy to set-up, and clean up. 

   3. I didn't do it much because I didn't feel ""good"" at it, but now I just enjoy the feeling of painting, usually at my kitchen table with coffee or tea, and my cat.

**Questions:**

1. What is something creative you enjoy doing? OR, what is something creative you'd like to learn?
2. What was the journey that brought you to that mode of expression in ONE sentence? Such as: how did you learn, why you wanted to learn it, how you have improved over time?
3. What is something that has been in your way (NOT financial) of learning something new/creative/or doing your creative hobby more? OR, (probably more helpful to all of us) HOW do you make time/space in your life for your creativity?

This will end August 3rd, in order to give people who aren't here much a chance to answer. I will be gifting something(s) creative.

Note: please no, ""I'm not creative,"" or ""I'll never have the time,"" answers. This contest is meant so be constructive and inspiring. Thank you! (edit: I edited my own answer to match the format because I was being a creative rebel!)",6,1756652637.0,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,14,1.0,False
1n4x0s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1n4x0s0/recommendations_please_for_september_buttercream/,Recommendations please for September Buttercream as Espresso [Bezzera Duo DE and Timemore 078s],"Hi all,
New to Espresso and decided to experiment with some beans that are different to the traditional Italian espresso that I normally drink.
One of the beans I‚Äôve bought is ‚ÄòSeptember - Buttercream‚Äô as it says the shower series can be brewed as pour over or a modern espresso, and the flavours of cardamom, pistachio and cinnamon sounds right up my street!
However, I have no idea where to start with this? 

- What recipe should I start with to then try and dial in to my taste? I assume the 1:2.5 I‚Äôve been using up to now isn‚Äôt appropriate?

- what sort of dose and basket? I have:
Bezzera 10g
Bezzera 20g
E&B 14/16g superfine
VST 22g
I‚Äôm assuming the E&B as the superfine membrane says it reduces fines, is good for harder to extract coffees (which I think would apply to this lighter roast compared to my normal beans?) and I‚Äôve read elsewhere on Reddit that it‚Äôs intended for lighter roasts (but can‚Äôt find this stated on the E&B site)

- How fine should I grind this?
I‚Äôm using a Timemore 078s so loose machine related guidance (I realise calibration will vary by machine) would be really appreciated!

- My Duo does preinfusion up to 5 seconds , adjustable in half second increments - any guidance?

I realise I‚Äôll need to adjust to the specifics of my equipment, water, and personal taste - but some guidance on a good starting position would be really appreciated so that I don‚Äôt end up wasting it all!

1n4wz5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1n4wz5o/hr_annual_purge/,[HR] Annual Purge,"Woodsbourne should have been a place where life slowed down‚Äîa place of quiet streets and friendly faces, the perfect setting for a new chapter. My husband, Matthew, and I had been searching for a home in a small rural town when we stumbled across it: a charming bungalow on the edge of the suburbs, its back garden spilling into a forest that stretched for miles. It felt too perfect to pass up.

I was nearly finished unpacking, fluffing the sofa pillows in the living room, when the doorbell rang. At the door stood a middle-aged woman in a patterned blue apron, holding a steaming casserole dish. ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù she said brightly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your neighbor, Sandra. I thought I‚Äôd welcome you with my famous peach cobbler. Do you have time for a cup of coffee? I‚Äôd love to get to know you and catch you up on what‚Äôs been happening in town.‚Äù

She beamed as she handed me the dish. ‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù I said, taking it carefully. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Riley. Matthew‚Äôs at work and won‚Äôt be home until later, but please, come in. That cobbler looks incredible. We‚Äôll have a slice with the coffee.‚Äù

I led her into the kitchen, and soon we were seated at the table overlooking the street, chatting over steaming mugs and sweet, sticky cobbler. Sandra filled me in on the basics‚Äîwho lived where, which neighbors to know, which ones to avoid. Then, her tone shifted. She set her cup down and looked at me steadily.

‚ÄúI only wish I came bearing good news,‚Äù she said, hesitating as if weighing whether to go on. I raised an eyebrow, waiting. ‚ÄúOne of the reasons Woodsbourne‚Äôs population is so small,‚Äù she continued carefully, ‚Äúis because of the annual **Purge**.‚Äù The word hung in the air like smoke.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like‚Äîpurging the town. Purging the people. Every year, the air is poisoned with a chemical, and those who breathe it in‚Ä¶ change. They lose themselves. Violence takes over, and they become uncontrollable. The only way to survive is to stay locked inside. No lights. No noise. Curtains drawn. And if anyone comes knocking, don‚Äôt open. Because they will knock. And the later it gets, the worse it becomes. If there‚Äôs even the smallest weakness in your home, they‚Äôll find it.‚Äù

Her voice dropped to a whisper. ‚ÄúSo please‚Äîstay inside tonight. Get cameras if you don‚Äôt already have them. And a weapon. Both of you.‚Äù She pushed her empty cup forward, giving me a moment to process her words. My mouth had gone dry.

Not long after, I walked her to the door. She hugged me warmly but whispered as she pulled away: ‚ÄúBe safe tonight.‚Äù

When Matthew came home, I told him everything. He chuckled, shaking his head. ‚ÄúSandra‚Äôs got a dark sense of humor, huh? Sounds like she‚Äôs trying to spook the new neighbors.‚Äù I laughed with him, but uneasily. There was no humor in Sandra‚Äôs eyes. Behind her smile, I‚Äôd glimpsed something else‚Äîfear.

That evening, with the curtains drawn and every lock secured, I checked the closet where we kept our sports gear. My eyes lingered on the golf clubs and baseball bats. Just in case. Later, as we ate dinner in front of the TV, Matthew kept joking about our neighbor and her ‚Äúghost stories.‚Äù I tried to laugh with him, but my eyes kept flicking toward the windows, toward the curtains I had pulled so tight.

Around midnight, I stirred awake. The house was silent, but something felt wrong. A faint hum pressed against my ears, low and constant, like static. I slipped out of bed and padded into the hallway. The air felt heavy, sweet, almost metallic. I coughed into my sleeve, my stomach twisting.

Then came a sound from the front door‚Äîa dull thump. Another. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. A shadow shifted across the frosted glass. My body locked up. My phone buzzed in my hand, nearly slipping from my grip. A notification from the security camera. I swiped it open with shaking fingers. The grainy feed showed two figures in the driveway, swaying as if drunk. One staggered up the steps and pressed his face close to the lens, eyes wide and glassy. His lips moved in a strange, jerky rhythm, as if he were trying to speak but couldn‚Äôt form the words.

Behind me, Matthew‚Äôs voice cut through the silence, groggy and annoyed. ‚ÄúRiley? What the hell are you doing?‚Äù I turned, the phone trembling. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs someone outside.‚Äù He rubbed his eyes, about to protest, when the knock came again.

*Thud. Thud.*

Then a gravelly voice followed, muffled through the door. ‚ÄúWe know you‚Äôre home‚Ä¶ waiting for us. Aren‚Äôt you going to invite us in?‚Äù

Matthew and I froze in the hallway, staring at each other with panic in our eyes. For a moment, there was silence. I thought I had imagined it, until I heard the unmistakable scrape of a window sliding open in the living room. My stomach dropped. Not all of the windows had been locked.

Matthew bolted to the closet, yanking out a golf club. He slammed the closet door shut behind him and rushed toward the living room. The silence shattered. A chorus of sounds erupted at once‚Äîmanic laughter, screaming, a heavy thud against the floor. Then Matthew‚Äôs voice, sharp and terrified:

‚ÄúRiley, RUN!‚Äù

I hesitated, torn between running to help him or bolting for safety. The decision came too late. Footsteps thundered toward me. Heart in my throat, I sprinted upstairs, slammed our bedroom door, and twisted the lock. I pressed my back against it, breath ragged. It was then I realized: I had no weapon. I was a sitting duck.

Hovering in the silence, I listened as the floorboards creaked below.

The voice behind the door sounded familiar, but something was wrong. It was a distorted hiss, a strained plea: ‚ÄúRiley, open the door, it‚Äôs me. They‚Äôre both dead, but I‚Äôm hurt pretty bad.‚Äù

Hesitantly, I opened the door and instantly realized my mistake. Looking at me was someone who used to be Matthew. His eyes were dark and hungry, his bathrobe was covered in blood, and a bloody golf club was clutched in his hand.

I ran to the dresser and grabbed the golf trophy Matthew had won after placing first in a national tournament. Tears streamed down my cheeks as I hit him with the trophy until my arms grew heavy.

‚ÄúRiley‚Ä¶ why?‚Äù Matthew gurgled, a thin trickle of blood running from his lips.

I blinked, my mind clearing in a terrifying instant. The fog of static that had clouded my thoughts dissipated, and I felt a horrifying sensation of returning to myself, of no longer being a passenger in my own body. He had sounded like himself. Like the real Matthew. My mind screamed for me to remember, to rewind, but all I found was a blank space‚Äîa blackout from the moment he had entered the room.

I looked past him and saw it: the bedroom window was open, a thin breeze carrying the sweet, metallic scent of the gas. The wind, which had felt so refreshing, was what had sealed my fate. The truth struck me with the force of a physical blow.

I gasped, feeling something shift inside me. The humming static returned, not in the air, but inside my skull. A low growl formed in my throat as I crouched over Matthew's still form. My eyes, I knew, were no longer my own. He wasn't a monster; he had been trying to warn me, to save me. But now, it was too late. I was the one who had inhaled the poisonous gas.

I had killed an innocent. I had claimed my first victim, and I was hungry for more, suddenly feeling a purpose within me. Wiping the blood from my eyes, taking the trophy with me, I head downstairs. Opening the front door, the night air is calling to me. It¬¥s time to make the most of it.

1n4wxf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1n4wxf4/ms_the_silent_guide/,[MS] The Silent Guide,"It was a quiet afternoon. Sam had just signed the lease for a two-bedroom apartment he had found at a reasonable price while searching for rentals. Some furniture remained in the rooms: a proper mattress with a metal bedframe, a brown leather sofa in the living room, and a glass coffee table.

The last remaining room had once been used as an office. A wooden computer desk with a couple of drawers sat against the wall. All were empty‚Äîexcept for one. When Sam tried to open it gently, it wouldn‚Äôt budge. After a bit more force, the drawer finally gave way, revealing a black diary with no visible markings. Curiosity pricked at him, even as he knew opening it might be an invasion of the previous tenant‚Äôs privacy.

Sam picked up the leather-bound diary and flipped it open. There was only one entry. The words looked commanding:

*‚ÄúTrust and obey, and fortune will smile. Ignore, and regret will haunt you.‚Äù*

He flipped through the rest of the pages, but they were all blank. *‚ÄúIt must be some kind of prank‚Äîor a creative joke,‚Äù* Sam thought, yet the words lingered in his mind.

Later, as he got ready for bed, he felt compelled to look at the diary again. The first entry remained the same, but as he turned the page, a new instruction had appeared:

*‚ÄúTomorrow morning, take your coffee from Brew & Bloom on Shallowedge Street instead of your usual Sip Happens on Roseman Street.‚Äù*

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ weird. And oddly specific. How would it even know where I get my morning coffee?‚Äù Unease crept over him, but the commanding words from the first page echoed in his mind. The instruction seemed simple enough‚Äîa tiny change in routine. What‚Äôs the worst that could happen*?*

The next morning, Sam stepped out of the apartment and turned left instead of his usual right, abandoning his daily route to his favorite coffee shop to follow the diary‚Äôs instructions. He had previously lived just two blocks closer, so his commute had remained the same‚Äîuntil today. Taking the new path added no more than five minutes to his commute, and trying new things once in a while wasn‚Äôt a bad idea, he told himself.

‚ÄúLarge cappuccino with a chocolate croissant, please,‚Äù Sam ordered at the counter, reaching for his wallet.

‚ÄúA man of great taste‚Äîmake it two,‚Äù said a voice behind him. Sam turned and froze. The most stunning woman he had ever seen was standing there, and before he realized it, she had handed her card to the cashier and paid for both of their orders.

‚ÄúThank you‚Ä¶ you shouldn‚Äôt have. How can I ever repay you for this generosity?‚Äù Sam barely managed to speak. She winked and said,

‚ÄúYou can take me out to dinner tomorrow. Primavera at 8 p.m. Don‚Äôt be late.‚Äù

Before he could respond, she was gone. He realized she hadn‚Äôt even given her name.

‚ÄúWhat about your coffee and croissant, miss?‚Äù he called after her, but was greeted with silence.

The rest of Sam‚Äôs day passed uneventfully, nothing out of his normal routine.

But if a date with a stunning stranger was the reward for visiting a different coffee shop, Sam felt like he had hit the jackpot. Maybe following the diary really did bring luck‚Ä¶

He grabbed the diary from his bedside table. Disbelief lingered that all of this wasn‚Äôt a dream. The diary had a new entry:

*‚ÄúGive a compliment to the first person smiling at you tomorrow.‚Äù*

*‚Äú*Do something that makes me feel better about myself and doesn‚Äôt cost me anything? Almost makes me wish the list were bigger*,‚Äù* Sam chuckled to himself, then drifted into sleep.

The next morning, he walked past the quiet streets toward the coffee shop. In front sat an old woman on the ground, a small cup in front of her. Inside were only a few coins. She looked rough and unnerving‚Äîhair wild as if struck by lightning, clothes ragged and full of holes, fingertips bruised and stained. Yet she smiled broadly at Sam, rotten teeth peeking from the corners of her mouth.

He froze. How was he supposed to compliment someone looking like‚Ä¶ her?

He fumbled in his pocket and said, ‚ÄúYou have beautiful eyes, and I wish you a good rest of your day.‚Äù

Her face lit up. She reached for his hand.

‚ÄúThank you, young man. The world needs more generous people like you. Look under your mat by your apartment door when you get home.‚Äù

The hours at work dragged endlessly. Finally, jingling his keys, Sam approached his apartment‚Äîand paused. Something slumped beneath the mat.

Sam lifted the mat and froze. Beneath it lay a stack of dollar bills‚Äîfive bundles, each wrapped with a silky red band.

Thirty thousand dollars.

Later, he met Janette‚Äîthe woman from the coffee shop‚Äîand by the end of the night, he had her number and a passionate kiss. Within two days, he had met the most gorgeous woman and earned $30,000. Sam felt delirious. All of this was meant to be. He fetched the diary, eager to see what the next mission would be.

"" *Grab the object from the left drawer and use it on someone tomorrow*.‚Äù

His hand shook from excitement as he pulled the drawer open‚Äîand froze. Inside lay a gun, its metal cold and gleaming under the faint light. Sam‚Äôs stomach turned. He had never even held a firearm before.

He stared at it, dread twisting in his chest. ‚Äú*Use it‚Ä¶ on someone‚Ä¶ tomorrow? This can¬¥t be happening‚Äù* The diary‚Äôs tone had no room for negotiation. His mind started racing: who? why? Could he even go through with this? Surely not.

Every rational thought screamed at him to close the drawer and forget about it, but a strange compulsion rooted him to the spot. The diary had rewarded obedience before‚Ä¶ but this? This was different. Terrifying. Real.

Sam swallowed hard, his palms slick with sweat. The gun felt impossibly heavy in his hand, as if it carried the weight of a choice he didn‚Äôt want to make. He looked down at the diary lying on the table, its pages open as if daring him.

He didn‚Äôt even want to get out of bed the next morning. He knew he couldn‚Äôt kill someone. He would be arrested immediately‚Äîand what excuse could he give? *A book told me to do it?* The thought almost made him burst out laughing, but there was nothing funny about it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to be fine,‚Äù Sam muttered, trying to push the diary from his mind. But boredom‚Äîand compulsion‚Äîdrew him back to it that evening.

*‚ÄúThis is your last warning. Stakes are higher. Use the gun on someone you know tomorrow or face the consequence.‚Äù*

‚ÄúSomeone I know‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not just anyone anymore. I can‚Äôt. I won‚Äôt. I‚Äôll just stop looking at this diary and carry on with my life without it,‚Äù Sam murmured aloud, slamming the diary shut with a heavy thud.

Two days later, a phone call shattered his fragile composure. On the other end, his mother was hysterical.

‚ÄúYour father had a car accident around midnight. He was rushed to the hospital, but his injuries were too severe‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs gone. Oh my God, what am I going to do without him, Sam?‚Äù

Sam felt nauseous. Could this be his fault? The diary‚Äôs consequence? No‚Ä¶ that couldn‚Äôt be real.

He spent the week in bed, weeping under the covers, yet still, his hand found the diary.

*‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one to blame but yourself. Try again tomorrow or suffer furthermore.‚Äù*

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt real. This diary doesn‚Äôt belong to me. I don‚Äôt belong here. I shouldn¬¥t have moved.‚Äù Sam tore at his hair, muttering incoherently, pacing the room like a trapped animal.

He couldn‚Äôt have the opportunity to kill anyone if he didn‚Äôt leave his apartment

The day passed in a blur, Sam weeping under the covers and watching tv, trying to avoid the diary‚Äîbut he couldn‚Äôt resist.

As he opened it again, the words sent a shiver down his spine. A sudden cold draft tickled the back of his neck. A soft creak came from the floor behind him. He froze. Heart hammering, shadows stretched and shifted in the corner.

*‚ÄúDo not look up from the diary‚Ä¶‚Äù*

A whisper crawled into his ear: *‚ÄúI‚Äôm right behind you.‚Äù*",1,1756652396.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1n4wx61,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n4wx61,Drama Smackdown: You Saved Me 10 Years Ago So I Bought You a Marriage Certificate," **IE: The Childhood Savior Flash Marriage Special**

¬†

 **Greetings,** paper crane collectors, plot amnesiacs who somehow forgot the most dramatic moment of their childhood, and everyone who's ever wondered why most CEOs in C-dramas has a very specific childhood trauma involving ONE helpful stranger!

 **This week on Drama Smackdown,** we're diving face-first into one of the most obsessive meet-cute formulas in vertical drama: the flash marriage where one party has been searching for their childhood savior for a decade, finally finds them through increasingly ridiculous coincidences, then speed-runs them into marriage while the other remains completely oblivious.

 Because nothing says ""healthy relationship foundation"" like marrying someone who doesn't remember giving you a band-aid in 2014.

 **TL;DR:** The ""Childhood Savior Flash Marriage"" follows a forensically precise formula where traumatized rich kids grow up to stalk‚ÄîI mean search for‚Äîtheir one-time helper, orchestrate an ""accidental"" reunion, manipulate them into marriage, then get jealous of themselves when their spouse doesn't remember their shared past. It's basically emotional catfishing with legal documentation.

 Let's dissect this beautiful disaster one predictable scene at a time.

 **SCENE 1: THE ORIGIN TRAUMA (Or: That Time a Paper Crane Changed Everything)**

 **The Setup:** Young ML, probably 8-12 years old, experiencing the Worst Day Ever‚Ñ¢. Parents just died/divorced/betrayed him. He's crying in the rain (always rain) outside a hospital/cemetery/orphanage/school.

 **The Beat:** Enter Young FL, an actual angel apparently, who offers:

* A memorable token (classic!)
* Half her sandwich (she's poor but generous!)
* A handkerchief (who gives children handkerchiefs??)
* Bandages for his conveniently placed wound
* Words of wisdom WAY too profound for a 10-year-old

 **The Payoff:** She disappears into the mist/rain/crowd before he gets her name. He clutches that memento like it's the Holy Grail.

 **Why This Scene MUST Happen:**

 This establishes the DISPROPORTIONATE significance of a brief kindness. One five-minute interaction becomes his entire personality. The writers need you to believe that this single moment of humanity was SO PROFOUND it justifies a decade of obsession and eventual marital fraud.

 **Pro tip:** The token she gives him MUST be handmade (or a family token) and worthless to anyone else, proving her kindness was pure, not transactional. No one's searching for the girl who gave them $20.

 **SCENE 2: THE OBSESSIVE SEARCH MONTAGE (Or: Definitely Not Stalking, Just Dedicated)**

 **The Setup:** Adult ML, now inexplicably wealthy and powerful, has an entire room/drawer/safe dedicated to childhood savior memorabilia.

 **The Beat:** Multiple scenes showing his ""search"":

* Assistant reports another dead end in finding ""savior girl""
* Visiting the original meeting spot annually like it's a grave
* Rejecting marriage proposals because ""his heart belongs to someone""
* That someone: a blurry memory of a 10-year-old

 **The Payoff:** ""I'll find her. I HAVE to find her."" *clutches paper that should've disintegrated years ago*

 **Why This Scene MUST Happen:**

 We need to see his dedication borders on unhinged without actually calling it unhinged. The search proves his feelings are ""pure"" and ""faithful"" rather than ""requiring therapeutic intervention.""

 **Notice:** He's NEVER considered she might be married, dead, or completely different as an adult. In his mind, she's frozen in time, waiting to be found like a lost wallet.

 **SCENE 3: THE ""ACCIDENTAL"" REUNION (Or: When Coincidence Needs a Restraining Order)**

 **The Setup:** FL, now an adult, living her life completely unaware she's someone's obsession‚Ä¶ I mean inspiration.

 **The Beat:** They meet through TOTALLY RANDOM circumstances:

* She's his new employee (totally coincidence!)
* Car accident where she helps him (poetry!)
* She's serving him coffee and spills it (classic!)
* Mistaken identity at a business meeting (sure, Jan)

 **The Recognition Moment:** He IMMEDIATELY knows it's her because:

* She has the same mole/birthmark (he remembered a MOLE?)
* Says the exact same phrase from childhood (photographic memory!)
* Has the same ""aura"" (I can't even...)

 **The Payoff:** He stares at her like she's the second coming. She's like ""why is this weirdo breathing so heavy?""

 **Why This Scene MUST Happen:**

 The ""accidental"" meeting lets him maintain the illusion he's not a stalker while clearly having engineered this entire situation. The instant recognition proves their connection is COSMIC, not creepy.

 **SCENE 4: THE MARRIAGE MANIPULATION (Or: Speed-Running Consent)**

 **The Setup:** He needs to lock her down IMMEDIATELY before she escapes again. But can't reveal the truth because... reasons.

 **The Beat:** Convenient crisis requiring marriage:

* She needs money for sick relative (an oldie but a goodie!)
* Visa/inheritance issues requiring spouse (legal loopholes!)
* He needs to avoid arranged marriage (family pressure!)
* Business deal requiring him to be married (capitalism!)

 **The Proposal:** ""It's just a business arrangement. One year. No feelings."" (LIES. ALL LIES.)

 **Her Consideration:** Takes maybe half an episode to decide to legally bind herself to a stranger because rent is due.

 **The Payoff:** Marriage certificate obtained. Him: internal celebration. Her: ""hope this doesn't backfire spectacularly.""

 **Why This Scene MUST Happen:**

 The flash marriage needs to seem like HER choice while being completely orchestrated by him. The ""business arrangement"" angle lets him have his obsession cake and eat it too, he gets proximity without revealing he's been searching for her since his balls dropped.

 **SCENE 5: THE ""SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER"" AGONY (Or: Selective Amnesia Strikes Again)**

 **The Setup:** He drops increasingly obvious hints about their past. She remains oblivious because apparently childhood memories just DELETE after age 18.

 **The Beat:** He tests her memory:

* Takes her to THE SPOT (""Nice park!"")
* Recreates the exact scenario (""What a coincidence!"")
* Literally describes the event (""Wow, similar thing happened to me!"")

 **The Frustration:** She remembers NOTHING. Not the traumatized boy, not the rain, not the life-changing moment that defined his entire existence.

 **The Payoff:** His internal monologue: ""How could she forget?"" Her internal monologue: ""I want pizza.""

 **Why This Scene MUST Happen:**

 Her totally convenient amnesia serves multiple formula functions:

1. Creates dramatic irony (we know, she doesn't)
2. Allows him to fall in love with ""current her"" not just the memory
3. Sets up for the dramatic revelation later
4. Justifies his jealousy of... himself

 **SCENE 6: THE CONFESSION REVELATION (Or: ""It Was Always You"" But Make It Creepy)**

 **The Setup:** Something triggers her memory, finding THE momento, seeing old photos, or him finally having a breakdown and word-vomiting the truth.

 **The Beat:** ""I've been looking for you for 10 years. You saved me that day. You gave me a reason to live. I've loved you since I was 12. I recognized you immediately. I orchestrated our entire relationship. Surprise!""

 **Her Reaction Options:**

* Touched: ""That's so romantic!"" (girl, no)
* Angry: ""You LIED to me!"" (appropriate)
* Confused: ""I gave you a paper crane so you... bought me?"" (realistic)

 **The Resolution:** After 0.5 seconds of conflict, she realizes it's TRUE LOVE because he waited so long and searched so hard.

 **The Payoff:** Emotional reunion music. Tears. Probably rain. Declaration of eternal love based on a five-minute childhood interaction.

 **Why This Scene MUST Happen:**

 This transforms the entire deception into a romantic gesture. His stalking becomes ""dedication."" His lies become ""protection."" His obsession becomes ""pure love."" The revelation retroactively justifies every manipulative thing he's done because DESTINY.

 **THE FORMULA PSYCHOLOGY: Why This Insanity Works**

 Every beat serves a specific purpose:

 ‚Ä¢ **Origin Trauma:** Makes him sympathetic despite future stalking ‚Ä¢ **Obsessive Search:** Proves dedication, not instability ‚Ä¢ **""Accidental"" Meeting:** Maintains destiny illusion ‚Ä¢ **Flash Marriage:** Locks her in before truth emerges ‚Ä¢ **Memory Absence:** Creates false conflict ‚Ä¢ **Self-Jealousy:** Proves feelings are ""real"" ‚Ä¢ **Revelation:** Transforms creepy into romantic

 The formula works because it hits our psychological weak spots:

* Wanting to be someone's lifelong obsession
* Believing in fate/destiny
* The fantasy that small kindnesses have massive impact
* The idea that patient waiting = true love

 **Hot Take: This entire trope is just emotional fraud with extra steps, but we eat it up because the idea of being so important to someone that they restructure their entire life around a childhood memory is the ultimate validation fantasy.**

 **Final Verdict?**

 The ""Childhood Savior Flash Marriage"" follows this exact formula because it lets us indulge in the fantasy that: Our small acts of kindness matter immensely, someone out there is searching specifically for us, deception is romantic if the feelings are real, and marriage based on childhood memories is somehow MORE pure than adult relationships

 It's problematic? Absolutely. Is it essentially romanticizing obsession and marital fraud? Definitely. Will we keep watching ML search for paper crane girl and manipulate her into marriage?

 *Checks credit card statement from ReelShort*

 Yes. Yes, we will.

 **What's your favorite ""childhood savior reveal"" scene?** Bonus points if there was rain, paper cranes, AND amnesia! Extra credit if he had an entire shrine to her childhood self that somehow wasn't considered creepy!

 üí• **This has been another Drama Smackdown** \- where we analyze why hot people lying about foundational relationships is peak romance and definitely not requiring immediate therapy.

But not everyone in the county belonged to that camp. The election unsettled a small group of people in Fayette who worried that the future of democracy might be in peril.

Concern evolved into action, and today that tight band of 15 or 20 people gathers near the Howard County Courthouse every Saturday, often in the rain or sweltering heat, to make themselves heard.

Almost all of them are over 65, and yet they stand with signs and slogans to protest what they consider serious overreach by the president.

The protests serve as a platform for these local progressives in a deep-red county, as well as a way to find camaraderie with like-minded people, said Beth Gold.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my reason for coming out,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFellowship, and I need to do something. I can‚Äôt just sit home angry. This gives me something to do.‚Äù

Gold is a regular protester and a member of the Howard County Progressives ‚Äî a local political organization with some 30 members. They have been meeting in Fayette on the last Saturday of the month for the past 22 years.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to know you‚Äôre not alone in this ruby-red state, in a ruby-red county, in a ruby-red town,‚Äù Gold said.

The weekly commitment
Fayette is the county seat of Howard County, a town with a population of just under 3,000, according to the 2024 census.

The county has voted consistently Republican for at least the past 20 years. More than 70% voted for Trump in 2020, and 66% backed him in 2016.

When Barack Obama was elected president in 2008 and again four years later, 60% of Howard County voters tried to defeat him.

Yet the small but determined liberal community in Howard County persists. In February, as Donald Trump hit his stride, local activist Hope Tinker decided they needed to do more.

‚ÄúIt became clear quite quickly with his executive orders that it was going to be totally different than his first administration,‚Äù said Tinker, a semi-retired physician and local activist deeply embedded within the progressive community in Fayette.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so contrary to the way our processes have worked in the past,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe believed we had checks and balances.‚Äù

When Trump proposed a takeover of the U.S. Postal Service, Tinker organized a protest in front of the local post office.

Then, after a flurry of executive orders began to stream from the White House shortly after the inauguration, the group quickly coalesced around a broader anti-Trump theme.

Now, the weekly protests aim to raise awareness and reach those in town who might also be troubled by the daily news.

The group is an ad hoc collection from various organized political groups ‚Äî the Howard County Progressives, the Howard County Democrats and the Howard County Democratic Women, as well as unaffiliated members.

Their protests started at the post office, but when the location didn‚Äôt get enough traffic, they moved to the northwest corner of the courthouse.

‚ÄúTrump has been the impetus for us as a group to have Saturday morning protests,‚Äù said Joe Geist, 92, who has lived in Fayette for 52 years. ‚ÄúTrump and his ideas.‚Äù

Gathering for peace
Hope Tinker was very young when she decided that the world was unfair. Raised by a Methodist minister and a psychologist whose faith informed their service, her worldview has always been wide.

‚ÄúI knew that very early,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI realized there wasn‚Äôt justice or equality, and there were people who didn‚Äôt live out their stated values.‚Äù

As a child in rural Iowa, she witnessed her parents‚Äô commitment to confronting injustice. They were involved in the Civil Rights Movement and volunteered during Freedom Summer, a campaign in June 1964 to register as many Black voters as possible in the state of Mississippi.

In 1965, her brother, John, was a lead plaintiff in the landmark First Amendment Supreme Court case, Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District. The case established free speech as a protected right in America‚Äôs public schools.

He and their sister, Mary Beth, along with several others, wore black armbands to their public school to protest American involvement in the Vietnam War. After he was suspended, their parents sued, and the case ended up before the Supreme Court.

While Hope Tinker was not directly involved in the case, she, too, had worn a black armband to her elementary school.

By the time she moved to Fayette, raised her family and established her medical practice, 18 years had gone by and she had lost touch with her activism.

‚ÄúI guess part of it was the 18 years of living in Fayette and feeling isolated or insulated from national politics,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúA whole lot happened during those years.‚Äù

In 2003, concerned by the George W. Bush administration‚Äôs involvement in Iraq, she began laying the groundwork for a call to activism.

She had learned as a college student studying urban planning at Washington University in St. Louis that success depends on connection. She‚Äôd seen it in the community her parents built in rural Iowa in the ‚Äò60s, and she wanted a community like that in Fayette.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fundamental,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf we want to make progress in this world toward peace and social justice and equality, we have to connect with people.‚Äù

She posted an ad in the newspaper for a ‚Äúgathering for peace‚Äù on Feb. 15 2003, where ‚Äúall are invited to come and peacefully express our concerns about our country‚Äôs plan to pursue a war with Iraq.‚Äù

It continued: ‚ÄúMeet neighbors over a cup of coffee, as we share hopes for peace.‚Äù

Continuing the conversation
The group conversation started around U.S. involvement in the Iraq War, but it didn‚Äôt stay there very long, said Geist, who has been a member of the Howard County Progressives since the group‚Äôs beginning.

‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt take very long for us to bridge out to other topics,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt take long because peace was involved in so many elements in our life.‚Äù

After the first meeting, they continued to gather once a month. Within the first few months, they‚Äôd expanded their focus and solidified their name as the Howard County Progressives.

Early days involved weekly potluck dinners, occasional protests, reading and discussing political books, writing letters to the editor of Fayette‚Äôs newspaper and conducting meetings, all in the homes of members.

‚ÄúWe met the last Saturday of the month, and we met in people‚Äôs homes, and then it got bigger and bigger and bigger,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThen Covid came, and we started using the church down at Saint Mary‚Äôs. That‚Äôs how it all started.‚Äù

The group has always been unstructured with no assigned leadership roles and only an occasional meeting agenda.

‚ÄúIt was a potluck, so we always had dinner first,‚Äù Geist said. ‚ÄúThen we asked who wanted to say something or discuss a topic.‚Äù

The socialization with like-minded people over a potluck has always been one of Gene Bowen‚Äôs favorite parts of the meetings.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that strictly political issues are motivating enough for people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think there has to be some sort of social component.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe potluck thing is really what has held this group together. If it had just been political discussions, I don‚Äôt know if it would have gone on this long.‚Äù

Bowen and his wife, Cindy, have been attending Howard County Progressives meetings for a little over two decades.

While he attributes the group‚Äôs longevity and success to the community, both he and his wife credit Hope Tinker for much of its vibrancy.

‚ÄúIt all comes back to Hope,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs basically the one who started this.‚Äù

Small town politics
Twenty-two years after Tinker put an ad in the paper seeking connection, the community she cultivated has flourished.

Plans to spread their message have not dimmed, even after two decades as tiny blue dots in a sea of red.

‚ÄúI think the community is not homogenous. It‚Äôs not all one side,‚Äù Tinker said. ‚ÄúAnd yes, I know what the ballot box shows, but I know also that statewide, 21% of people are independents. And statewide, there‚Äôs more people who didn‚Äôt vote than voted for either party.‚Äù

Geist believes conviction is the foundation of the group‚Äôs commitment.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think that it‚Äôs almost useless or a waste of time, but this has grown to be a major part of our lives in the last 12 months in America,‚Äù he said.

Cindy Bowen suggests that commitment is also a factor of available time.

‚ÄúWhen we were young, we were busy working, raising kids, or doing activities,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think that might be part of it.‚Äù

While they say their work doesn‚Äôt seem to have persuaded the county‚Äôs red majority, it has made a distinct impact on the members.

Bowen said she has found real catharsis in the weekly protests, the Howard County Progressives and her role on the Howard County Democratic Committee.

‚ÄúPeople are tired,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey want to feel like they‚Äôre doing something. You feel helpless, your hands are tied, but you feel like you‚Äôre trying to do something to make people more aware.‚Äù

Geist said they are also inspired by the steady growth of national protests.

‚ÄúWe are just a mirror of the whole country,‚Äù he said.

Tinker actually believes that the people of Howard County are actually more tolerant than they might appear.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs 75% of the community who think we‚Äôre horrible, awful, unpatriotic commies or socialists,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think they just don‚Äôt have the time or the bandwidth.

‚ÄúEven if they are appalled at what Trump‚Äôs doing, they still have to cook dinner and go shopping and go to their jobs and get the kid to the music contest or the State Fair.‚Äù",68,1756652287.0,missouri,1,1.0,False

This oxygen-based laundry booster is designed to naturally remove stains, brighten fabrics, and improve detergent efficiency. I‚Äôve been testing it for a couple of weeks, and there‚Äôs a lot to unpack about this product's features, performance, and quirks.

**Convenient and Compact Packaging**  
The first thing that struck me was the size and design of the packaging. With dimensions of 9.57 x 4.25 x 2.09 inches, the pouch is compact enough to tuck away neatly in a laundry cabinet without eating up valuable space. Weighing just 1.56 pounds, it‚Äôs light and manageable to pour into your laundry without the awkward heft of bulkier boxes of detergent additives. The resealable packaging also prevents the product from clumping due to moisture, which, having dealt with similar powders in the past, is a game-changer for me.

**Reliable Stain Removal and Fabric Brightening**  
I tested this powder on everything from coffee stains on t-shirts to mud-caked jeans, and I‚Äôll admit, my expectations were modest. To my surprise, the oxygen cleaning boost worked like a charm! It didn‚Äôt just lift the stains but also significantly brightened old clothes that had started looking a bit tired. The powder doesn‚Äôt rely on chlorine for its cleaning magic, making it gentler for fabrics and a safer option for families like mine with kids who seem to generate laundry faster than I can keep up. 

[Check GuardH Sodium Percarbonate Powder price on Amazon.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b0dz6mswcv/)

**Versatile Multi-Surface Use Beyond Laundry**  
While the main goal for me was enhancing my laundry routine, it wasn‚Äôt long before I started testing this product on other areas in my home. Per the instructions, I dissolved a spoonful in water and used it to clean kitchen tiles and my bathroom sink. Both ended up looking sparkling clean, and it felt good knowing I wasn‚Äôt using harsh chemicals. This versatility impressed me, as it means I don‚Äôt have to juggle a dozen different cleaning products just to keep my home tidy.

**Safe and Eco-Friendly Formula**  
Being formulated without chlorine, the sodium percarbonate powder relies on oxygen action instead, making it biodegradable and safer for use near little ones. I can‚Äôt stress how important this is to me. Chlorine-heavy cleaners often leave behind a pungent smell and make me worry about harmful residue sticking around even after rinsing. With this powder, there‚Äôs no lingering odor, and I feel better about its environmental impact.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compatible with standard washing machines and home cleaning applications.  
- Oxygen-based stain removal avoids the use of harsh chlorine.  
- Resealable and moisture-proof packaging ensures long-lasting product quality.  

**Areas of Concern**  
While I loved the performance, there were minor hiccups.  
- Dissolving the powder takes a little more effort than expected. Warm water helps, but it‚Äôs something to note if you‚Äôre in a hurry.  
- Some tougher stains needed a second application to fully disappear. For folks expecting miracles on the first try, patience might be required.  

**Competing Products**  
In comparing this product to other laundry boosters like OxiClean or similar stain removers, I‚Äôd say this powder holds its own quite well. OxiClean, for instance, offers excellent stain-fighting abilities but often comes with a higher price tag and slightly less environmentally friendly formulas. On the other hand, cheaper alternatives don‚Äôt offer the same versatility or effectiveness across multiple surfaces as the GuardH powder. For households looking for an eco-conscious and wallet-friendly cleaner, this is a solid contender.

**Quality for Price**  
Analyzing the cost-effectiveness of the sodium percarbonate powder, I‚Äôd call it a fair deal given its dual functionality for laundry and home cleaning. It‚Äôs rare to find a product that stays cost-efficient while also maintaining high performance. Typically, I‚Äôve seen eco-friendly options at a significantly higher price point, so having this as an affordable alternative adds to its appeal.

My husband got crushed by equipment at his construction job three weeks ago. Multiple broken ribs, punctured lung, the whole thing. He's been in the ICU fighting for his life.

I know how this sounds already. But hear me out.

We've been married eight years and things have been dead between us for months. No sex, barely talking, just existing in the same house. When the accident happened, I realized I might lose him without ever being honest about what I needed.

So I went to see him in the hospital. He was awake but hooked up to all these machines. I held his hand and told him I loved him but I needed more. I said maybe we could try an open marriage when he got better.

He just stared at me. Then he said, ""Are you seriously asking me this while I'm lying here like this?""

I tried to explain that I wasn't asking to cheat. I wanted us to be honest with each other. But he got so upset his heart rate monitor started going crazy. A nurse came in and asked me to leave.

That was two weeks ago. He hasn't wanted to see me since.

His brother came by the house last weekend to get some things for him. We started talking and one thing led to another. I was lonely and scared and he was there for me when my own husband wasn't.

We ended up in my bedroom. It felt good to connect with someone who actually wanted to be with me.

I posted a picture of us together on Facebook the next morning. Nothing inappropriate, just us having coffee in bed. I captioned it ""Finally found someone who appreciates me. Upgrading to the better brother.""

Now his entire family is calling me everything but my name. His sister showed up at my door screaming that I'm a monster. His mom called me sobbing asking how I could do this to her son while he's fighting for his life.

But here's what they don't understand. I've been emotionally neglected for months. He shut me out completely after his accident. I needed support and comfort and he couldn't give that to me. His brother could.

His family is talking about getting lawyers involved. They say what I did was cruel and heartless. But I was just trying to survive an impossible situation.

_January 29th, 2021. Nevada, USA._

On the opposite side of the world from Saint Catherine's Monastery, in a place equally desertified where the sun scorched the sands and mountainous dunes until they were sometimes bleached white, there sat a secret Air Force base that had become a little too well-known for the liking of the military's higher-ups.

This base was known as Area 51.

It had become famous over the last several decades due to internet conspirators spinning all manner of strange, made-up tales. But it was, without a doubt, a highly remote and secure location ripe with secrets the United States would rather keep under lock and key.

It was night-time at the base. The sun would peek over the horizon within less than an hour, and already the faintest wisps of light were becoming visible over the hills. The stars twinkled above, and the lack of ambient background light made stargazing a fun activity for guards to momentarily relieve their boredom. The light pollution of the bigger cities was much less muted this far out in the desert, and the lights inside the base were not oppressive enough to drown out the stars.

Amy Sandoval was one of the many people watching the base's sizable outer perimeter. She was twenty years old, with blonde hair kept in a bob, and she wore a helmet with attached goggles that granted her enhanced night vision. As a night-guard, she wasn't anyone of particular note, but she was planning to apply for a special ops assignment later that year. She had heard rumors of a secret new military test being conducted by multiple branches, and she was interested in earning promotions quickly. It wouldn't do for her to waste these crucial early years. If she became known as a lazy bum or a floozy, her career would quickly stall out and eventually nosedive.

Amy had a nickname. _Ambitious Amy._ Some of the other soldiers mocked her for it, but most stayed out of her way. She was neat, orderly, and took care of herself and her weapons. She was a stickler for the rules as written; less so their spirit. If anyone on the base was going to get a promotion, she hoped it would be her.

She was only a Private now, but in the future... anything was possible.

Amy paced back and forth, alternating looking up at the sky, which had its stars become even more brilliant with the help of her night vision, and the horizon, where she would be able to see enemies coming from miles away, unless they were wearing camouflage capable of fooling her night vision. But that's why the other guards wore thermal and infrared goggles; to cover more possible avenues of attack.

""It's a cold one tonight..."" Amy muttered to herself, as she exhaled warm air onto her gloved hands to try and heat them up. Deserts might be known for their scorching days, but they were equally fearsome when it came to their cold nights.

Suddenly, a light flashed in the sky above. Amy glanced up at it.

The light flickered for so short and brief a time that Amy momentarily thought she must have hallucinated it. Perhaps it was a shooting star, or one of the men on the base waved a flashlight up into the air, or-

**BATOOOOM!!!**

A horrifying explosion detonated half a kilometer behind Amy. Amy turned around to look at what had just happened, only for a brilliant light erupting from the explosion site to momentarily blind her, followed by a shockwave slamming into and throwing her body like a ragdoll.

""Aaugh!"" Amy cried, as she was flung backward. She skidded across the sand, causing it to funnel into her clothing and boots, but she had no time to pay attention to her discomfort. She massaged her eyes and stumbled to her feet, visibly confused.

_What the fuck? Was that a missile? Did somebody attack the base?_

""HQ, this is Private Sandoval, something just exploded half a click from the base's entrance! It's inside the perimeter!"" Amy shouted into her radio. ""I'm going to investigate! HQ! HQ, can you hear me? HQ??""

She spoke into her walkie-talkie while jogging heavily across the thick and viscous sand, but all she received were crackling noises in response. In the distance, she could hear noises of confused yelling, followed by a few cries of pain. Whatever had detonated inside the base must have injured some people.

Suddenly, shouts of alarm rang out. Amy couldn't make out the exact words, but they were all angry and fearful.

Then, gunfire erupted. Bullets started flying in the air, and the sounds of whizzing shells in the distance made Amy dive to the ground.

_What the hell are they shooting at? Have the others gone mad?!_ Amy screamed in her head.

Amy hunkered down on the ground, afraid of a stray bullet striking her from the people crazily shooting at... something. She was still too far away to make out what was happening, but she could swear she saw sparks of... _electricity_? Was that what it was? She zoomed her night vision goggles to try and get a better look, but what she saw only made her even more confused.

A few dozen troopers surrounded... something in the darkness. The muzzles of their guns flickered with light as they rapidly discharged bullet after bullet at the thing. Then, it moved, and its body began to glow.

Its body. That's right. It was a creature.

Lightning crackled violently around the monster. As the lightning became more energetic, Amy finally got her first look at the thing. It turned out to be... a person? A human? But with horns...

""HAHAHA! PITIFUL!"" The creature suddenly shouted, its voice clearly female. ""You ants think yourselves my match? You can all DIE!""

At that moment, something happened that was so horrifying, Amy's blood turned to ice.

The woman swept her palms in an outward motion. More than thirty lightning bolts fired outward in a cone before her, swept through the bodies of the brave men and women daring to try and take her down, and instantly killed them on the spot.

Some of the soldiers exploded into chunks of superheated meat and bone.

Many of them scattered to ash.

A few shuddered and spasmed in agony for a few seconds before their internal organs burst, causing blood to erupt from all their orifices.

None of them screamed. They couldn't. Her lightning was so powerful that it killed them all on the spot. Their bodily spasms were caused purely by involuntary neuro-receptor triggers.

Just as quickly as the woman attacked, the gunfire stopped. Every human in the immediate vicinity perished. All except for Amy.

Amy stopped breathing. She was so frightened that she started trembling from head to toe. She knew the people who had just been killed. She had served with a few of them since she joined the military two years ago. Being assigned to this base was supposed to be a fairly prestigious position, one that would accelerate her future career trajectory.

Now, she felt it was the most horrifying, stupid, unthinkably idiotic decision she had ever made in her life.

Amy knew that by the end of this day, she was almost certainly going to die.

_Oh god, oh god, oh fuck, fuck fuck fucking fuck me..._ Amy chanted in her mind, unable to form a coherent thought.

Just as soon as Amy thought that the woman with the white hair was about to turn around and kill her, she didn't. The woman flickered away, seemingly out of existence, and a second massive explosion, right at the entrance to the underground base, detonated once more.

Amy's bones nearly leaped right out of her skin.

_What is even HAPPENING right now?!_ She screamed in her heart.

...................................

Inside the White House, it was eight AM. President Johannesburg sipped his morning coffee and skimmed through a few reports on his desk detailing the movements of 'Red Sentients' southeast of Israel. These reports were sent over by the ISDF requesting recon drones to survey the area. Steven frowned.

_Being the President is way more intense than I expected._ He thought. _I expected it to be mostly about political dealings and pushing my agenda through, but instead I'm fighting a secret war against the fucking demons. What an absurd world we've all turned out to be living in._

He quickly signed off on approving the reconnaissance drone support, but hardly had he started to move on to the next report before a frenzied series of knocks followed on the entrance to the Oval Office.

""Mister President! It's urgent!"" Came the voice of a man Johannesburg begrudgingly recognized.

""Come in, Chris."" Steven said, glancing at the door.

A moment later, the door flew open, and Steven's morbidly obese bastard of a Defense Secretary, Chris Brisker, charged into the room while waving papers.

""Sir! Sir!"" Chris said, his jowls flapping with a mixture of fear and excitement. ""It happened! The Red Sentients launched an attack forty-five minutes ago on one of Egypt's remote regions! We weren't able to predict their movements perfectly, but we know their target. They attacking the Holy Mountain next!""

Unfortunately, as the Secretary of Defense, Chris was one of a select few who had been debriefed on the existence of so-called Red Sentients. The thought that he knew such a precious national secret made him practically shake with excitement. He was a big fan of knowing things, and an even bigger fan of running his damn mouth. Steven secretly feared it was only a matter of time before he flapped his gums to the media and revealed the 'big secret'.

The more Steven thought about the modern world, the more he thought keeping a secret as big as the existence of the metaphysical world under wraps was an impossible task. With smartphones in every citizen's hands, and the media practically drooling for a crazy scoop to splash across their front pages, it was a miracle the secret hadn't been let out. Or maybe it had, and the Men in Black were better at their jobs than he knew.

""An attack?"" Steven asked, directing his full attention to Chris. ""Tell me more.""

And so he did. Chris quickly sat down across from Steven, blabbering incessantly about every minute detail he knew, even as Steven read the reports Chris had handed him.

""They're setting up a forward position. Something defensible they can use to flood the entrance to Heaven with hellspawn. It seems they're either going to construct or already have constructed a barrier meant to keep missiles from hitting their ops-base.""

Steven fell silent for roughly five seconds. He tapped his chin thoughtfully.

""So? How will we respond?"" Chris prompted impatiently. ""I say we go in guns blazing! Send in the boys!""

""Mother of god, Chris. Calm down."" Steven said, glowering at his cabinet-member. What was he thinking, putting this moron in charge of defense? First chance he got, he'd send in the MiB to wipe Chris's memory and put someone less idiotic in charge. ""A military response is appropriate, given the angels are our nominal allies. But this is happening on Egyptian soil. We need to inform them first and see if they can prepare a response first. Appraise President Abdul of the broad situation and see what his response is. We'll need six hours to coordinate a proper response before we can even think of moving in troops.""

Chris's voice lowered. ""But... what if the demons aren't interested in taking their time? They seem to be moving quickly. Blitzkrieg, shock and awe, that sort of thing. We might show up only for the battle to already be over.""

""I don't care how powerful the demons are."" Steven stated. ""War is a logistical nightmare. The demons are trying to gain entry into a hidden realm with only one major entrance. Once they're inside, they might be able to open portals of their own to flood inside, but even gaining entry will not be easy. Heaven has already been invaded once, and the angels took great care to fortify the entrance far beyond its ancient strength. Coupled with billions of Lazarites at their beck and call, they have a lot of meat they can throw into the demon grinder if they must. They will be able to stall until we arrive.""

Steven tapped the report with one finger. ""I noticed it said here that the Hero known as 'Cat Mask' appeared on-site and nearly killed Demon Emperor Lucifer all by himself. That means he and his son, as well as the Illuminati, have likely been informed of the matter and are monitoring the situation. It's imperative the United States takes action, but we must not be hasty. It would send the wrong message. We must project strength and confidence. Rushing in blindly will indicate a state of panic and fear on our end, which will increase the demons' morale. We don't want them thinking we're _afraid_ of them, do we, Chris?""

Chris looked at Steven blankly. ""Uhh, right! You said it yourself, Mister President. Look strong, not weak.""

Steven quietly sighed. He really needed to replace Chris, and soon. The guy practically had a black hole of intelligence in his head. If his father hadn't been a sitting senator for two decades, he'd probably never have risen in the political theater.

""Alright, you're dismissed, Chris."" Steven said, waving his hand. ""Tell the war room to prepare a recon report on the composition of the demon army. I'll join them in thirty minutes.""

""Sure thing, Mister President!"" Chris blubbered, standing up quickly and nearly knocking over his seat. He quickly exited the war room, making Steven sigh for perhaps the hundredth time.

""I _need_ to get rid of him."" Steven muttered to himself.

He glanced at another set of papers on his desk, with the words _TOP SECRET: Project Vanguard_ written on the front.

""Not yet."" Steven whispered. ""Hopefully it'll be ready within a few years. Perhaps even before the end of my first term...""

...................................

Jason Hiro sat inside a secret room somewhere deep within the heart of Aevum. This room was sealed behind multiple layers of security, including spells that hid his location, his aura, and prevented trace-backs of his soul link.

That last part was especially important. Four phantasmal versions of Jason sat in lotus positions around him, their ghostly bodies unmoving. Their bodies glowed with an eerie blue light, and their eyes shone even brighter still. They looked at Jason emptily, not a single thought stirring within their souls.

These were Jason's newest creations: Spiritual Incarnations.

Not like when he fought Ose and stupidly brought his soul out of his body, and not like her Astral Body either; these Incarnations were intimately linked to his soul. In fact, they were severed pieces of it, which were directly controlled by Jason, but indirectly separated from his True Body. Any higher level Psion that knew of these incarnations would be shocked, if not horrified out of their mind! It was a similar principle behind how their True Souls remotely piloted false bodies across the cosmos!

Jason's four Incarnations each remotely piloted a Dronesmith v2. One of those Dronesmiths hung out with Daisy and her friends, while the other three executed other missions. By now, Daisy had grown suspicious of the fact that her 'father' was acting a little weird, and because she couldn't sense his soul or his thoughts. Naturally, Jason had already fortified his Mind Realm to prevent random telepaths from reading his thoughts, but the security measure was even more potent when he controlled a Dronesmith. They didn't have any thoughts to read in the first place!

His Mind Realm was directly shielded, his body was hidden within a secret room which itself was hidden within the secret realm of Aevum, and his incarnations were only indirectly linked to his body via spirit links. This meant that the situation he had encountered in the past where Hope was able to trace a link from the Dronesmiths back to Jason and then yank him back into Realspace would never happen again!

Jason had learned from his past mistakes. He still had a long way to go, but perfectionism was the enemy of progress.

Around Jason, a new version of the Spynet had been created. It no longer used computer or digital television screens, but instead highly optimized spiritual displays that could output everything from sights and sounds to smells and emotions.

Jason had been hard at work developing the new and improved Spynet v2. This one came complete with Psion detection algorithms, including activity trackers for high level Psions, as well as Demonic Energy detectors.

Jason pursed his lips. He turned to look at the slow-moving image of his father battling Demon Emperor Lucifer at Catherine's Monastery.

""Hmm. It might be time for Project Great Deceiver to move to Phase Two."" Jason said to nobody in particular. ""The demons know about the legendary Cat Mask, and his fame is starting to grow. If I send the 'Archseer' into battle, I can probably stir up some trouble. But Ose is starting to worry me a little. She and Satan had a private discussion about something I wasn't able to intercept. What did she tell him...?""

Jason glanced at one of his Incarnations. ""Any thoughts?""

The blank-eyed spiritual construct said nothing. It simply continued to creepily stare directly at him, an invisible leyline of energy transmitting between its 'brain' and his.

""Well, whatever."" Jason muttered. ""Even if Ose figures out everything, including the fact I'm a time traveler, and she uncovers how my powers _really_ work, it won't matter. Aevum is hidden halfway across the galaxy in a location too remote for her to reach. I have the absolute advantage in terms of abilities and resources.""

Jason chewed his lip.

""What's the worst thing that could possibly happen if she figures out too many Truths I'm trying to keep hidden? Well, my father's information on the future could decay quickly. The demons could start making moves he never expected. In fact, this attack on Heaven is happening far sooner than he ever expected. I'd be tempted to download his memories if what I saw wouldn't scare the shit out of me. God knows what horrors he's seen across tens of billions of years...""

Jason blinked. He looked at the Incarnation to his right. He looked through its eyes and sighed in relief.

""Oh, good. So. Raphael's 'Cosmic Realm' exists and so far I haven't found any Kolvaxians inside of it. That means they weren't around by this point in the timeline. I probably have a while before they arrive or are created.""

Jason tapped his knee thoughtfully. ""Kolvaxians. Are they invaders from another galaxy? A biological experiment gone wrong? Gone _right_? Did the Volgrim create them, then play stupid about their origins? Can I trust anything Unarin told me? And how did they breach the Cosmic Realm anyway? Could they be related to Andromeda...""

Jason's eyes flashed. He suddenly smiled as he looked to his left.

""Yes! You found it! Right at the edge of the Hell Harbor system... as expected.""

Elsewhere in the galaxy, one of Jason's Dronesmiths materialized inside a different realm, one where the stars had completely disappeared. It flew toward a massive Cube seemingly lightyears in the distance, and when the Cube expanded in the drone's field of view, it drew closer and closer until it was able to circle around and locate the entrance.

Jason took direct control of this particular Dronesmith. He levitated into the Cube and immediately came into contact with the ten Sentry Stars that activated when they sensed the intruder's presence.

[**HRRM BRRRM BRMM!**]

Their loud, vibration-like language struck the Dronesmith, only to bounce right off. Inside Aevum, Jason uttered a Word of Power.

""**Deactivate.**""

All ten Sentry Stars turned off at the same time. They floated inertly in place, posing no harm to Jason.

For the first time, Jason took a serious look at them. He inspected their internals with his Wordsmithing and his hyper-advanced MindCore. He was shocked out of his mind at what he saw.

""My god! What high level artifacts! These Sentry Stars don't use human technological principles, but instead alien ones that fuse with angelic mana to create a masterful fusion of technology and magic! The energy pathways alone!! If I could reverse engineer these concepts to the fullest extent, I could increase my efficiency of absorbing interstellar energy into Aevum by a factor of ten!!""

He was shocked out of his mind! Whatever Camael had done to create these Sentry Stars, her artisanal abilities were far beyond his. For the first time ever, he began to feel a sort of engineering 'hunger' toward Camael. He desperately wished to pick her brain and see what he could learn.

Consensually, of course. He wasn't about to strap her down to a mad scientist's torture table and suck out her brain juices or anything psychotic like that. Unless she deserved it. Who knew what atrocities she may have committed in the past before Raphael's mind-wipes.

Jason's excitement increased even more the longer he looked at their schematics. ""These are no ordinary constructs. Each one must have required a massive number of exotic materials in order to make them so large, which means Camael spared no expense. It seems they're even better at battling Cosmic entities than they are mortal ones, provided they have enough power fueling them. That makes sense, too! Camael designed them to protect the Cube in an era where Apex Cosmics roamed the Milky Way freely. She must have feared the dragons would come to free their captive brother...""

Jason turned his gaze toward the center of the Cube. His expression turned solemn as he uttered a Word of Power and became disappointed by what he found.

His body flickered. The Dronesmith teleported to the Cube's center, and he found the control matrix in the same condition as when he stumbled across it in the future. There were images of ancient monsters emblazoned on the control cube's six sides, and a massive hole had been torn out of one of those images, ruining it beyond recognition.

""The dark dragon isn't here."" Jason muttered to himself quietly. ""That means it escaped well before the Energy Wars. As expected. Leviathan must have escaped and traveled to Earth to hide long, long ago.""

Jason's mind stirred. He thought about what he'd just said, then slowly shook his head.

""Was it Leviathan? I don't know... this seems a little out of his _modus operandi_. From what I've gleaned, he's not a particularly malicious bastard, full of anger and rage. He seemed quite content to sleep in a cave and leave everyone else alone. And it seems dragons were not the actual 'bad guys' of the Primordial Era. They were simply prey for the angels. Prey that fought back and ultimately lost the war. In a way the dragons were... tragic figures.""

Jason's eyes flashed.

""Then who was the dark dragon contained within this prison? If it wasn't Leviathan, could it have been a different one? But Dragons shared their power. If Leviathan was as strong as he was while there was still another dragon alive, then killing one of them would double the strength of the other!""

A chill went down Jason's spine. ""That would mean if there really was another dragon, then it would have become twice as strong as it was after it escaped the Cube, given Leviathan died at some point. When did he die though? I don't think I ever learned that specific information. Amelia never told me...""

The Dronesmith levitated around the small inner cube. It was only 'small' relative to the primary cube enveloping it, because in actuality it was two kilometers wide from edge to edge. Its interior had to be vast in order to accommodate its ancient long-escaped prisoner.

Jason finally reached the side that held the engraved image of the Phoenix. When he arrived, he spotted the 100-foot in diameter red orb that housed the Phoenix. With Jason having prematurely shut off the Sentry Stars, his previous interaction of the Phoenix exiting their central cerebral units to meet him never happened. Instead, the orb flickered to life and glowed a dim red color.

[Hello, friend!] The Phoenix said, as she suddenly exited her control unit. She flew around Jason excitedly, a tiny orb of glowing red energy that examined him from head to toe. [How odd! You look a lot like the Big Mean Dummies! Your body is really strange. But it seems nice!]

Jason smiled. [Hello, Phoenix. I'm here to save you from your boredom. Do you know who I am?]

[No idea!] The Phoenix chirped. [But you seem like a friend, so I'll call you Friend!]

[I am your friend, and you can just continue calling me that if you want, or you can call me Jason. Anyway, let me examine your control matrix.]

He mostly ignored the Phoenix. He felt a little bad, but she had already endured eons of boredom and loneliness. A few minutes of not having her questions immediately answered wouldn't hurt.

""**Examine. Diagram. Inspect.** Hmm, so it's like that. Marvelous. In the past, I was too ignorant to comprehend the greater profundities of technology, but now I am truly awed by Camael's work. She is far, far above my level when it comes to her artifacts' refinement of stellar and celestial energy.""

Jason looked up at the Phoenix's glowing orb. [Phoenix, do you know who Camael is?]

[Nope!] The Phoenix replied. [Her name sounds nice. Is she a friend, too?]

[She is.] Jason answered. [But she can't talk to you right now. She lost her memories, just like you did. Well, I'll have to solve one problem first before solving another. Let's see if I can juice you up a bit...]

Jason frowned. When he died in the future and reawakened inside the Cube, Beelzebub was there, and he had apparently used some technique to revive the Phoenix back to its original form. How did he do it?

Jason traced his memories. He recalled that Beelzebub had mentioned being linked to the Phoenix somehow. That made sense. Jason knew Beelzebub was linked to it because the damned artifact had revived Beelzebub and recognized him as her 'friend'. Luckily, it all worked out in the end, and Beelzebub ended up saving Jason's life.

In his heart, Jason had finally forgiven Beelzebub. Not fully, but most of the way. Beelzebub hadn't killed Daisy, but he did kill countless other humans. Beelzebub had converted to humanity's side in the end. He wasn't irredeemable, but a victim of the system he was raised in.

If Beelzebub could become an ally to humanity, then didn't that mean other demons could, as well? Jason wasn't sure. He didn't want to end up sacrificing millions of humans to find out either. In the future, he would give demons chances to amend their ways, but he would never be as foolish as he was in his youth and give that trust freely and without restrictions.

Jason shook his head. He focused on the Phoenix again and started to think.

_Beelzebub used his 'link' to transfer his Middle Cosmic energy to the Phoenix. I'm not a Middle Cosmic, so I can't do that. But maybe I can use a different method?_

Jason examined the Phoenix's Control Unit more carefully now that he had a goal in mind. He quickly found that it was actually a machine capable of absorbing and controlling vast amounts of energy in order to empower itself and its internal systems.

Jason marveled at his new understanding of _Angelitech_. Camael's comprehension of its principles were far above his own, and as a novice, he was only beginning to tap into the greater possibilities such technology held. 

From what he could tell, the Cube was actually incomplete! It had never been finished. Camael clearly intended not to make a prison for a dragon with it, but... something else.

Jason spent several Aevum hours grokking this information. He closed his eyes and started rapidly disassembling and reassembling the Cube and its control unit, along with the Sentry Stars, bit by bit. Such a vast construct was not simple to dissect. It took serious effort on his part to do so.

After hours of engrossing research, Jason came to a conclusion.

""This was originally just a casual experiment. Camael repurposed it into a prison for the Dark Dragon, but that wasn't the Cube's original purpose. That may even be why it was able to escape. The dragon grew in power after Leviathan died... no, was it when Leviathan died? Is Leviathan even dead?""

Jason wasn't sure. He hadn't been able to locate the dragon, but he knew due to Gressil's existence that it was possible to hide from his Wordsmithing. He had considered the possibility that Leviathan's death gave the 'dark dragon' the power to escape the Cube, but perhaps it escaped even earlier than that. Jason simply wasn't certain.

""Anyway, the Cube wasn't originally made to be a prison. Based on what I've gleaned, Camael was wavering between making a new realm of some sort, similar to Heaven, where the angels could reside without leaking their cosmic power, but she was also thinking of constructing an intergalactic warship. Something she and the other Angels could enter and use to travel across the cosmos, attacking their enemies among the other Rulers and Sentients across the universe. That's why the Cube is able to move around in the higher dimensions. But ultimately, she failed to realize either of her visions...""

Jason pondered for a while. In realspace, this happened over the course of only a few seconds. But in Aevum time, he spent several minutes.

""It would be a waste to simply turn the Cube into a second Aevum. I need to give it a unique purpose that makes the best use of its capabilities. Well, for now at least, I'll just worry about re-energizing its power matrix and bringing it to Aevum's sector near the galactic core. That should only require a few real-weeks of travel time. Plenty of Aevum-years for me to think about what to do with it by the time it arrives.""

Jason spent another hour or two reconstructing the Phoenix's control matrix. As he did, he chatted the little bird up and had a good time getting to know her again. This time though, he was not in the dark about her capabilities, and could awe her with his knowledge.

[That's right. Ice cream is very cold and delicious.] Jason said. [Once I build you a new body, you can have a taste of it. You'll probably melt it once it gets too close to you, but you can still savor its sugary goodness.]

[Wow! Wowee, friend! I can't wait to taste the creamed ice!] The Phoenix chirped. [Is my matrix thingy finished yet? Is it fixed? Is it? Is it?]

She pestered him multiple times, but Jason never lost his patience. If it wasn't for the Phoenix, he would never have revived, traveled back in time, and found out that his daughter was still alive.

Jason's vision momentarily dimmed. Even if Daisy was alive, and even if he'd met his father, Phoebe was still gone.

His wife was dead.

Thinking about Phoebe... always caused a cloud of despair to swallow his mind. It was impossible to feel good about life when she had been a key driving force that always kept him going.

Right now, he stayed alive and fought for both Daisy and Hideki's sakes. But if they passed, Jason believed he wouldn't have the motivation to go on any longer.

They were his weak points. If the demons ever killed these last two people who kept him clinging to the mortal coil, Jason really didn't think he had it in him to keep living.

...

Eventually, Jason finished his work. He reignited the Cube's power source, summoned the Sentry Stars, and initialized its jump drive. The Cube leaped into P-space and began traveling out of the Hell Harbor system toward the southern edge of the Milky Way's core.

Jason left his Dronesmith inside the Cube to monitor its situation and control its progress. He activated its autonomous control mode, allowing the drone to pilot the cube without Jason's direct intervention.

Jason had long decided he would never again create clones of himself. Hope was an unfortunate accident that led to the worst disaster of Jason's entire life. Therefore, Incarnations were Jason's next best option. They were linked to his mind, and he could control them directly, but they could also be set to act autonomously, making the same general choices he would make if he controlled them, but at a fraction of the brainpower.

This allowed him to switch them to autonomous mode where they would transmit information to him, and even fight or explore on their own, but they were not clones with unique minds of their own. They were merely low-bandwidth copies of Jason's exact personality that he could retake control of at any time.

""They'd be even more effective if I instead had a MindCore installed that was focused on swarm-like manipulation of drones. I could autonomously pilot tens, hundreds, even thousands of Dronesmiths. But I wouldn't give up my GenesisFrame for anything. The ability to invent and summon objects at rapid speeds is way more valuable to me. I'll just have to deal with 'only' projecting myself into a few specific places at a time.""

One of Jason's four drones was talking to his daughter and her friends. Another was exploring the Cosmic Realm. A third was navigating the Cube to Aevum's star system.

As for the fourth one...

Jason glanced behind himself at the fourth Incarnation, which also stared at him with blank, glowing eyes.

""The demons are about to attack Heaven. Ose is attacking Area 51 for some reason. Should I intervene in one of those two situations?""

Naturally, his Incarnation did not offer a reply. Jason simply liked to talk out loud because hearing himself speak often helped sort his thoughts.

""No. My dad can handle those situations. I'll let him do what he thinks is most appropriate. Even if the demons end up utterly slaughtering all of angelkind, I won't intervene. Compared to the threat of the Psions, the demons are nothing at all. They don't even know about Demon Deities in this era. No, I need to keep my eyes on the bigger picture...""

Jason summoned his to-do list, which by now had become a lot longer and better organized.

- REACQUIRE ORIGINAL POWERS AND ABILITIES AT OR EXCEEDING PREVIOUS LEVELS (Progress: 85%)

- REBUILD INTERNAL MIND REALM; ESTABLISH NEW 'SMITHY' PROTOCOLS; RETURN BRAIN FUNCTION TO SUPERHUMAN LEVELS (Plan exchanged for new one)

- CREATE NEW MINDCORE, USE IT TO SPEED UP COMPLETION OF OTHER PLANS (Done)

- CONSTRUCT TIME ACCELERATED REALM (Progress: 47%)

- LOCATE CAMAEL'S CUBE, MOVE TO AEVUM'S STAR SECTOR (In-progress)

- CONSIDER MOVING ENTIRETY OF MARIE'S FUTURE REMNANT OASIS FACILITY TO SECRET DIMENSIONAL SPACE (Undecided)

- PROJECT 'GREAT DECEIVER' (Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Pending)

- INVESTIGATE VOLGRIM, DETERMINE THREAT LEVELS (Progress: 5%)

- EMPOWER HUMANS, REMOVE FLAW (Progress: 3%)

- PACIFY DEMONS, PREFERABLY FORM ALLIANCES, BUT EXTERMINATE IF NECESSARY (Not started)

- DETERMINE RELATIONSHIP WITH ANGELS - DECIDE BETWEEN STATUS QUO, ALLIANCE, OR EXTERMINATION (Not started)

- LOCATE BAHAMUT, SAVE PHOEBE (Not started)

- LOCATE BLACK WITCH, DETERMINE CURRENT STATUS (Not started)

...

As Jason looked at these options, his thoughts turned chaotic. There was still one entry on the list he desperately wanted to act on, but it would be selfish to jump the gun. He wanted to save Phoebe and prevent Bahamut from torturing her and all the other humans, but he had yet to look for them.

Finding out Amelia's location would be important, too. She knew the status of Leviathan and could give Jason answers about the dark dragon.

Was it Leviathan that escaped the Cube? Or was it a different 'dark dragon'? Jason wasn't sure. His intuition leaned toward the latter, but it was always possible he might have misread the situation...

Suddenly, Jason's attention shifted. He sensed an unknown entity had been teleported into the containment area of Aevum, a place Jason had told his father he could always send someone if he wanted to safeguard their life but wasn't sure if he could trust them. It wouldn't leak the existence of Aevum, and whoever was teleported there wouldn't be able to cause any serious problems. After all, the holding zone was constructed of high level reinforced Wordsmithium...

When Jason investigated the newcomer, he was slightly startled.

""Her? How could it be her?""

Jason opted to send his final Dronesmith into the containment area. There, he found a woman with white hair spilling out of her helmet, her angelic wings unmoving as she lay on the ground, dazed and injured.

""Cassiel...?"" Jason asked, as he approached her.

The woman stirred. Despite wearing a helmet that covered her face, Jason knew what she looked like. He had seen her in the future, after all.

""Ugh... you... who are you?"" Cassiel asked. ""Where is this place?""

She found herself inside a metal warehouse-like area. Not too large, big enough to fit a few trucks inside, with medical devices, containers filed with various food types, and other assorted items strewn around in a fairly efficient hospital-like layout.

""My name is Jason Hiro."" Jason replied. ""I am the Archseer.""

Cassiel raised her head. She looked at him through the slits in her helmet and frowned.

""You? You're that second Trueborn? Raphael has spoken of you.""

Jason knelt beside her. ""Are you injured? This facility can heal you.""

Cassiel clutched her ribs and winced. ""Emperor Lucifer... ugh... she struck me a most grievous blow. I'm lucky I didn't perish on the spot. How did I even arrive here?""

""My father brought you."" Jason said, taking care not to reveal too many details. ""Here, let me help you up. Rest in this chair. The time flow here is quite fast. If you spend a day here, only a few minutes will pass in the real world.""

She nodded at him, but her movements were guarded. ""In that case, I offer my thanks, Archseer.""

""Just call me Jason, Cassiel."" Jason said, as he took her hand and pulled her to her feet.

When she stood up, she looked at him and frowned. ""So I didn't mishear. You called me that name again. You must have me confused with someone else. My name is _not_ Cassiel. She was one of the ancient Archangels. She is long dead.""

""Oh! That's right."" Jason said, suddenly remembering she never actually told him her name. ""Then how should I address you?""

Cassiel looked at him for a moment, then shook her head.

""Heaven's Daughter is just fine. My name is... not important anymore. I am not worthy of it.""

Jason raised an eyebrow. _What did she mean by that, exactly?_

""Alright. That name's a bit clunky, but it'll do."" Jason replied.

As 'Heaven's Daughter' sat in the lounging chair and relaxed a bit, she merely nodded.

""Yes. It will.""",7,1756651509.0,HFY,4,0.82,False

On the opposite side of the world from Saint Catherine's Monastery, in a place equally desertified where the sun scorched the sands and mountainous dunes until they were sometimes bleached white, there sat a secret Air Force base that had become a little too well-known for the liking of the military's higher-ups.

This base was known as Area 51.

It had become famous over the last several decades due to internet conspirators spinning all manner of strange, made-up tales. But it was, without a doubt, a highly remote and secure location ripe with secrets the United States would rather keep under lock and key.

It was night-time at the base. The sun would peek over the horizon within less than an hour, and already the faintest wisps of light were becoming visible over the hills. The stars twinkled above, and the lack of ambient background light made stargazing a fun activity for guards to momentarily relieve their boredom. The light pollution of the bigger cities was much less muted this far out in the desert, and the lights inside the base were not oppressive enough to drown out the stars.

Amy Sandoval was one of the many people watching the base's sizable outer perimeter. She was twenty years old, with blonde hair kept in a bob, and she wore a helmet with attached goggles that granted her enhanced night vision. As a night-guard, she wasn't anyone of particular note, but she was planning to apply for a special ops assignment later that year. She had heard rumors of a secret new military test being conducted by multiple branches, and she was interested in earning promotions quickly. It wouldn't do for her to waste these crucial early years. If she became known as a lazy bum or a floozy, her career would quickly stall out and eventually nosedive.

Amy had a nickname. _Ambitious Amy._ Some of the other soldiers mocked her for it, but most stayed out of her way. She was neat, orderly, and took care of herself and her weapons. She was a stickler for the rules as written; less so their spirit. If anyone on the base was going to get a promotion, she hoped it would be her.

She was only a Private now, but in the future... anything was possible.

Amy paced back and forth, alternating looking up at the sky, which had its stars become even more brilliant with the help of her night vision, and the horizon, where she would be able to see enemies coming from miles away, unless they were wearing camouflage capable of fooling her night vision. But that's why the other guards wore thermal and infrared goggles; to cover more possible avenues of attack.

""It's a cold one tonight..."" Amy muttered to herself, as she exhaled warm air onto her gloved hands to try and heat them up. Deserts might be known for their scorching days, but they were equally fearsome when it came to their cold nights.

Suddenly, a light flashed in the sky above. Amy glanced up at it.

The light flickered for so short and brief a time that Amy momentarily thought she must have hallucinated it. Perhaps it was a shooting star, or one of the men on the base waved a flashlight up into the air, or-

**BATOOOOM!!!**

A horrifying explosion detonated half a kilometer behind Amy. Amy turned around to look at what had just happened, only for a brilliant light erupting from the explosion site to momentarily blind her, followed by a shockwave slamming into and throwing her body like a ragdoll.

""Aaugh!"" Amy cried, as she was flung backward. She skidded across the sand, causing it to funnel into her clothing and boots, but she had no time to pay attention to her discomfort. She massaged her eyes and stumbled to her feet, visibly confused.

_What the fuck? Was that a missile? Did somebody attack the base?_

""HQ, this is Private Sandoval, something just exploded half a click from the base's entrance! It's inside the perimeter!"" Amy shouted into her radio. ""I'm going to investigate! HQ! HQ, can you hear me? HQ??""

She spoke into her walkie-talkie while jogging heavily across the thick and viscous sand, but all she received were crackling noises in response. In the distance, she could hear noises of confused yelling, followed by a few cries of pain. Whatever had detonated inside the base must have injured some people.

Suddenly, shouts of alarm rang out. Amy couldn't make out the exact words, but they were all angry and fearful.

Then, gunfire erupted. Bullets started flying in the air, and the sounds of whizzing shells in the distance made Amy dive to the ground.

_What the hell are they shooting at? Have the others gone mad?!_ Amy screamed in her head.

Amy hunkered down on the ground, afraid of a stray bullet striking her from the people crazily shooting at... something. She was still too far away to make out what was happening, but she could swear she saw sparks of... _electricity_? Was that what it was? She zoomed her night vision goggles to try and get a better look, but what she saw only made her even more confused.

A few dozen troopers surrounded... something in the darkness. The muzzles of their guns flickered with light as they rapidly discharged bullet after bullet at the thing. Then, it moved, and its body began to glow.

Its body. That's right. It was a creature.

Lightning crackled violently around the monster. As the lightning became more energetic, Amy finally got her first look at the thing. It turned out to be... a person? A human? But with horns...

""HAHAHA! PITIFUL!"" The creature suddenly shouted, its voice clearly female. ""You ants think yourselves my match? You can all DIE!""

At that moment, something happened that was so horrifying, Amy's blood turned to ice.

The woman swept her palms in an outward motion. More than thirty lightning bolts fired outward in a cone before her, swept through the bodies of the brave men and women daring to try and take her down, and instantly killed them on the spot.

Some of the soldiers exploded into chunks of superheated meat and bone.

Many of them scattered to ash.

A few shuddered and spasmed in agony for a few seconds before their internal organs burst, causing blood to erupt from all their orifices.

None of them screamed. They couldn't. Her lightning was so powerful that it killed them all on the spot. Their bodily spasms were caused purely by involuntary neuro-receptor triggers.

Just as quickly as the woman attacked, the gunfire stopped. Every human in the immediate vicinity perished. All except for Amy.

Amy stopped breathing. She was so frightened that she started trembling from head to toe. She knew the people who had just been killed. She had served with a few of them since she joined the military two years ago. Being assigned to this base was supposed to be a fairly prestigious position, one that would accelerate her future career trajectory.

Now, she felt it was the most horrifying, stupid, unthinkably idiotic decision she had ever made in her life.

Amy knew that by the end of this day, she was almost certainly going to die.

_Oh god, oh god, oh fuck, fuck fuck fucking fuck me..._ Amy chanted in her mind, unable to form a coherent thought.

Just as soon as Amy thought that the woman with the white hair was about to turn around and kill her, she didn't. The woman flickered away, seemingly out of existence, and a second massive explosion, right at the entrance to the underground base, detonated once more.

Amy's bones nearly leaped right out of her skin.

_What is even HAPPENING right now?!_ She screamed in her heart.

...................................

Inside the White House, it was eight AM. President Johannesburg sipped his morning coffee and skimmed through a few reports on his desk detailing the movements of 'Red Sentients' southeast of Israel. These reports were sent over by the ISDF requesting recon drones to survey the area. Steven frowned.

_Being the President is way more intense than I expected._ He thought. _I expected it to be mostly about political dealings and pushing my agenda through, but instead I'm fighting a secret war against the fucking demons. What an absurd world we've all turned out to be living in._

He quickly signed off on approving the reconnaissance drone support, but hardly had he started to move on to the next report before a frenzied series of knocks followed on the entrance to the Oval Office.

""Mister President! It's urgent!"" Came the voice of a man Johannesburg begrudgingly recognized.

""Come in, Chris."" Steven said, glancing at the door.

A moment later, the door flew open, and Steven's morbidly obese bastard of a Defense Secretary, Chris Brisker, charged into the room while waving papers.

""Sir! Sir!"" Chris said, his jowls flapping with a mixture of fear and excitement. ""It happened! The Red Sentients launched an attack forty-five minutes ago on one of Egypt's remote regions! We weren't able to predict their movements perfectly, but we know their target. They attacking the Holy Mountain next!""

Unfortunately, as the Secretary of Defense, Chris was one of a select few who had been debriefed on the existence of so-called Red Sentients. The thought that he knew such a precious national secret made him practically shake with excitement. He was a big fan of knowing things, and an even bigger fan of running his damn mouth. Steven secretly feared it was only a matter of time before he flapped his gums to the media and revealed the 'big secret'.

The more Steven thought about the modern world, the more he thought keeping a secret as big as the existence of the metaphysical world under wraps was an impossible task. With smartphones in every citizen's hands, and the media practically drooling for a crazy scoop to splash across their front pages, it was a miracle the secret hadn't been let out. Or maybe it had, and the Men in Black were better at their jobs than he knew.

""An attack?"" Steven asked, directing his full attention to Chris. ""Tell me more.""

And so he did. Chris quickly sat down across from Steven, blabbering incessantly about every minute detail he knew, even as Steven read the reports Chris had handed him.

""They're setting up a forward position. Something defensible they can use to flood the entrance to Heaven with hellspawn. It seems they're either going to construct or already have constructed a barrier meant to keep missiles from hitting their ops-base.""

Steven fell silent for roughly five seconds. He tapped his chin thoughtfully.

""So? How will we respond?"" Chris prompted impatiently. ""I say we go in guns blazing! Send in the boys!""

""Mother of god, Chris. Calm down."" Steven said, glowering at his cabinet-member. What was he thinking, putting this moron in charge of defense? First chance he got, he'd send in the MiB to wipe Chris's memory and put someone less idiotic in charge. ""A military response is appropriate, given the angels are our nominal allies. But this is happening on Egyptian soil. We need to inform them first and see if they can prepare a response first. Appraise President Abdul of the broad situation and see what his response is. We'll need six hours to coordinate a proper response before we can even think of moving in troops.""

Chris's voice lowered. ""But... what if the demons aren't interested in taking their time? They seem to be moving quickly. Blitzkrieg, shock and awe, that sort of thing. We might show up only for the battle to already be over.""

""I don't care how powerful the demons are."" Steven stated. ""War is a logistical nightmare. The demons are trying to gain entry into a hidden realm with only one major entrance. Once they're inside, they might be able to open portals of their own to flood inside, but even gaining entry will not be easy. Heaven has already been invaded once, and the angels took great care to fortify the entrance far beyond its ancient strength. Coupled with billions of Lazarites at their beck and call, they have a lot of meat they can throw into the demon grinder if they must. They will be able to stall until we arrive.""

Steven tapped the report with one finger. ""I noticed it said here that the Hero known as 'Cat Mask' appeared on-site and nearly killed Demon Emperor Lucifer all by himself. That means he and his son, as well as the Illuminati, have likely been informed of the matter and are monitoring the situation. It's imperative the United States takes action, but we must not be hasty. It would send the wrong message. We must project strength and confidence. Rushing in blindly will indicate a state of panic and fear on our end, which will increase the demons' morale. We don't want them thinking we're _afraid_ of them, do we, Chris?""

Chris looked at Steven blankly. ""Uhh, right! You said it yourself, Mister President. Look strong, not weak.""

Steven quietly sighed. He really needed to replace Chris, and soon. The guy practically had a black hole of intelligence in his head. If his father hadn't been a sitting senator for two decades, he'd probably never have risen in the political theater.

""Alright, you're dismissed, Chris."" Steven said, waving his hand. ""Tell the war room to prepare a recon report on the composition of the demon army. I'll join them in thirty minutes.""

""Sure thing, Mister President!"" Chris blubbered, standing up quickly and nearly knocking over his seat. He quickly exited the war room, making Steven sigh for perhaps the hundredth time.

""I _need_ to get rid of him."" Steven muttered to himself.

He glanced at another set of papers on his desk, with the words _TOP SECRET: Project Vanguard_ written on the front.

""Not yet."" Steven whispered. ""Hopefully it'll be ready within a few years. Perhaps even before the end of my first term...""

...................................

Jason Hiro sat inside a secret room somewhere deep within the heart of Aevum. This room was sealed behind multiple layers of security, including spells that hid his location, his aura, and prevented trace-backs of his soul link.

That last part was especially important. Four phantasmal versions of Jason sat in lotus positions around him, their ghostly bodies unmoving. Their bodies glowed with an eerie blue light, and their eyes shone even brighter still. They looked at Jason emptily, not a single thought stirring within their souls.

These were Jason's newest creations: Spiritual Incarnations.

Not like when he fought Ose and stupidly brought his soul out of his body, and not like her Astral Body either; these Incarnations were intimately linked to his soul. In fact, they were severed pieces of it, which were directly controlled by Jason, but indirectly separated from his True Body. Any higher level Psion that knew of these incarnations would be shocked, if not horrified out of their mind! It was a similar principle behind how their True Souls remotely piloted false bodies across the cosmos!

Jason's four Incarnations each remotely piloted a Dronesmith v2. One of those Dronesmiths hung out with Daisy and her friends, while the other three executed other missions. By now, Daisy had grown suspicious of the fact that her 'father' was acting a little weird, and because she couldn't sense his soul or his thoughts. Naturally, Jason had already fortified his Mind Realm to prevent random telepaths from reading his thoughts, but the security measure was even more potent when he controlled a Dronesmith. They didn't have any thoughts to read in the first place!

His Mind Realm was directly shielded, his body was hidden within a secret room which itself was hidden within the secret realm of Aevum, and his incarnations were only indirectly linked to his body via spirit links. This meant that the situation he had encountered in the past where Hope was able to trace a link from the Dronesmiths back to Jason and then yank him back into Realspace would never happen again!

Jason had learned from his past mistakes. He still had a long way to go, but perfectionism was the enemy of progress.

Around Jason, a new version of the Spynet had been created. It no longer used computer or digital television screens, but instead highly optimized spiritual displays that could output everything from sights and sounds to smells and emotions.

Jason had been hard at work developing the new and improved Spynet v2. This one came complete with Psion detection algorithms, including activity trackers for high level Psions, as well as Demonic Energy detectors.

Jason pursed his lips. He turned to look at the slow-moving image of his father battling Demon Emperor Lucifer at Catherine's Monastery.

""Hmm. It might be time for Project Great Deceiver to move to Phase Two."" Jason said to nobody in particular. ""The demons know about the legendary Cat Mask, and his fame is starting to grow. If I send the 'Archseer' into battle, I can probably stir up some trouble. But Ose is starting to worry me a little. She and Satan had a private discussion about something I wasn't able to intercept. What did she tell him...?""

Jason glanced at one of his Incarnations. ""Any thoughts?""

The blank-eyed spiritual construct said nothing. It simply continued to creepily stare directly at him, an invisible leyline of energy transmitting between its 'brain' and his.

""Well, whatever."" Jason muttered. ""Even if Ose figures out everything, including the fact I'm a time traveler, and she uncovers how my powers _really_ work, it won't matter. Aevum is hidden halfway across the galaxy in a location too remote for her to reach. I have the absolute advantage in terms of abilities and resources.""

Jason chewed his lip.

""What's the worst thing that could possibly happen if she figures out too many Truths I'm trying to keep hidden? Well, my father's information on the future could decay quickly. The demons could start making moves he never expected. In fact, this attack on Heaven is happening far sooner than he ever expected. I'd be tempted to download his memories if what I saw wouldn't scare the shit out of me. God knows what horrors he's seen across tens of billions of years...""

Jason blinked. He looked at the Incarnation to his right. He looked through its eyes and sighed in relief.

""Oh, good. So. Raphael's 'Cosmic Realm' exists and so far I haven't found any Kolvaxians inside of it. That means they weren't around by this point in the timeline. I probably have a while before they arrive or are created.""

Jason tapped his knee thoughtfully. ""Kolvaxians. Are they invaders from another galaxy? A biological experiment gone wrong? Gone _right_? Did the Volgrim create them, then play stupid about their origins? Can I trust anything Unarin told me? And how did they breach the Cosmic Realm anyway? Could they be related to Andromeda...""

Jason's eyes flashed. He suddenly smiled as he looked to his left.

""Yes! You found it! Right at the edge of the Hell Harbor system... as expected.""

Elsewhere in the galaxy, one of Jason's Dronesmiths materialized inside a different realm, one where the stars had completely disappeared. It flew toward a massive Cube seemingly lightyears in the distance, and when the Cube expanded in the drone's field of view, it drew closer and closer until it was able to circle around and locate the entrance.

Jason took direct control of this particular Dronesmith. He levitated into the Cube and immediately came into contact with the ten Sentry Stars that activated when they sensed the intruder's presence.

[**HRRM BRRRM BRMM!**]

Their loud, vibration-like language struck the Dronesmith, only to bounce right off. Inside Aevum, Jason uttered a Word of Power.

""**Deactivate.**""

All ten Sentry Stars turned off at the same time. They floated inertly in place, posing no harm to Jason.

For the first time, Jason took a serious look at them. He inspected their internals with his Wordsmithing and his hyper-advanced MindCore. He was shocked out of his mind at what he saw.

""My god! What high level artifacts! These Sentry Stars don't use human technological principles, but instead alien ones that fuse with angelic mana to create a masterful fusion of technology and magic! The energy pathways alone!! If I could reverse engineer these concepts to the fullest extent, I could increase my efficiency of absorbing interstellar energy into Aevum by a factor of ten!!""

He was shocked out of his mind! Whatever Camael had done to create these Sentry Stars, her artisanal abilities were far beyond his. For the first time ever, he began to feel a sort of engineering 'hunger' toward Camael. He desperately wished to pick her brain and see what he could learn.

Consensually, of course. He wasn't about to strap her down to a mad scientist's torture table and suck out her brain juices or anything psychotic like that. Unless she deserved it. Who knew what atrocities she may have committed in the past before Raphael's mind-wipes.

Jason's excitement increased even more the longer he looked at their schematics. ""These are no ordinary constructs. Each one must have required a massive number of exotic materials in order to make them so large, which means Camael spared no expense. It seems they're even better at battling Cosmic entities than they are mortal ones, provided they have enough power fueling them. That makes sense, too! Camael designed them to protect the Cube in an era where Apex Cosmics roamed the Milky Way freely. She must have feared the dragons would come to free their captive brother...""

Jason turned his gaze toward the center of the Cube. His expression turned solemn as he uttered a Word of Power and became disappointed by what he found.

His body flickered. The Dronesmith teleported to the Cube's center, and he found the control matrix in the same condition as when he stumbled across it in the future. There were images of ancient monsters emblazoned on the control cube's six sides, and a massive hole had been torn out of one of those images, ruining it beyond recognition.

""The dark dragon isn't here."" Jason muttered to himself quietly. ""That means it escaped well before the Energy Wars. As expected. Leviathan must have escaped and traveled to Earth to hide long, long ago.""

Jason's mind stirred. He thought about what he'd just said, then slowly shook his head.

""Was it Leviathan? I don't know... this seems a little out of his _modus operandi_. From what I've gleaned, he's not a particularly malicious bastard, full of anger and rage. He seemed quite content to sleep in a cave and leave everyone else alone. And it seems dragons were not the actual 'bad guys' of the Primordial Era. They were simply prey for the angels. Prey that fought back and ultimately lost the war. In a way the dragons were... tragic figures.""

Jason's eyes flashed.

""Then who was the dark dragon contained within this prison? If it wasn't Leviathan, could it have been a different one? But Dragons shared their power. If Leviathan was as strong as he was while there was still another dragon alive, then killing one of them would double the strength of the other!""

A chill went down Jason's spine. ""That would mean if there really was another dragon, then it would have become twice as strong as it was after it escaped the Cube, given Leviathan died at some point. When did he die though? I don't think I ever learned that specific information. Amelia never told me...""

The Dronesmith levitated around the small inner cube. It was only 'small' relative to the primary cube enveloping it, because in actuality it was two kilometers wide from edge to edge. Its interior had to be vast in order to accommodate its ancient long-escaped prisoner.

Jason finally reached the side that held the engraved image of the Phoenix. When he arrived, he spotted the 100-foot in diameter red orb that housed the Phoenix. With Jason having prematurely shut off the Sentry Stars, his previous interaction of the Phoenix exiting their central cerebral units to meet him never happened. Instead, the orb flickered to life and glowed a dim red color.

[Hello, friend!] The Phoenix said, as she suddenly exited her control unit. She flew around Jason excitedly, a tiny orb of glowing red energy that examined him from head to toe. [How odd! You look a lot like the Big Mean Dummies! Your body is really strange. But it seems nice!]

Jason smiled. [Hello, Phoenix. I'm here to save you from your boredom. Do you know who I am?]

[No idea!] The Phoenix chirped. [But you seem like a friend, so I'll call you Friend!]

[I am your friend, and you can just continue calling me that if you want, or you can call me Jason. Anyway, let me examine your control matrix.]

He mostly ignored the Phoenix. He felt a little bad, but she had already endured eons of boredom and loneliness. A few minutes of not having her questions immediately answered wouldn't hurt.

""**Examine. Diagram. Inspect.** Hmm, so it's like that. Marvelous. In the past, I was too ignorant to comprehend the greater profundities of technology, but now I am truly awed by Camael's work. She is far, far above my level when it comes to her artifacts' refinement of stellar and celestial energy.""

Jason looked up at the Phoenix's glowing orb. [Phoenix, do you know who Camael is?]

[Nope!] The Phoenix replied. [Her name sounds nice. Is she a friend, too?]

[She is.] Jason answered. [But she can't talk to you right now. She lost her memories, just like you did. Well, I'll have to solve one problem first before solving another. Let's see if I can juice you up a bit...]

Jason frowned. When he died in the future and reawakened inside the Cube, Beelzebub was there, and he had apparently used some technique to revive the Phoenix back to its original form. How did he do it?

Jason traced his memories. He recalled that Beelzebub had mentioned being linked to the Phoenix somehow. That made sense. Jason knew Beelzebub was linked to it because the damned artifact had revived Beelzebub and recognized him as her 'friend'. Luckily, it all worked out in the end, and Beelzebub ended up saving Jason's life.

In his heart, Jason had finally forgiven Beelzebub. Not fully, but most of the way. Beelzebub hadn't killed Daisy, but he did kill countless other humans. Beelzebub had converted to humanity's side in the end. He wasn't irredeemable, but a victim of the system he was raised in.

If Beelzebub could become an ally to humanity, then didn't that mean other demons could, as well? Jason wasn't sure. He didn't want to end up sacrificing millions of humans to find out either. In the future, he would give demons chances to amend their ways, but he would never be as foolish as he was in his youth and give that trust freely and without restrictions.

Jason shook his head. He focused on the Phoenix again and started to think.

_Beelzebub used his 'link' to transfer his Middle Cosmic energy to the Phoenix. I'm not a Middle Cosmic, so I can't do that. But maybe I can use a different method?_

Jason examined the Phoenix's Control Unit more carefully now that he had a goal in mind. He quickly found that it was actually a machine capable of absorbing and controlling vast amounts of energy in order to empower itself and its internal systems.

Jason marveled at his new understanding of _Angelitech_. Camael's comprehension of its principles were far above his own, and as a novice, he was only beginning to tap into the greater possibilities such technology held. 

From what he could tell, the Cube was actually incomplete! It had never been finished. Camael clearly intended not to make a prison for a dragon with it, but... something else.

Jason spent several Aevum hours grokking this information. He closed his eyes and started rapidly disassembling and reassembling the Cube and its control unit, along with the Sentry Stars, bit by bit. Such a vast construct was not simple to dissect. It took serious effort on his part to do so.

After hours of engrossing research, Jason came to a conclusion.

""This was originally just a casual experiment. Camael repurposed it into a prison for the Dark Dragon, but that wasn't the Cube's original purpose. That may even be why it was able to escape. The dragon grew in power after Leviathan died... no, was it when Leviathan died? Is Leviathan even dead?""

Jason wasn't sure. He hadn't been able to locate the dragon, but he knew due to Gressil's existence that it was possible to hide from his Wordsmithing. He had considered the possibility that Leviathan's death gave the 'dark dragon' the power to escape the Cube, but perhaps it escaped even earlier than that. Jason simply wasn't certain.

""Anyway, the Cube wasn't originally made to be a prison. Based on what I've gleaned, Camael was wavering between making a new realm of some sort, similar to Heaven, where the angels could reside without leaking their cosmic power, but she was also thinking of constructing an intergalactic warship. Something she and the other Angels could enter and use to travel across the cosmos, attacking their enemies among the other Rulers and Sentients across the universe. That's why the Cube is able to move around in the higher dimensions. But ultimately, she failed to realize either of her visions...""

Jason pondered for a while. In realspace, this happened over the course of only a few seconds. But in Aevum time, he spent several minutes.

""It would be a waste to simply turn the Cube into a second Aevum. I need to give it a unique purpose that makes the best use of its capabilities. Well, for now at least, I'll just worry about re-energizing its power matrix and bringing it to Aevum's sector near the galactic core. That should only require a few real-weeks of travel time. Plenty of Aevum-years for me to think about what to do with it by the time it arrives.""

Jason spent another hour or two reconstructing the Phoenix's control matrix. As he did, he chatted the little bird up and had a good time getting to know her again. This time though, he was not in the dark about her capabilities, and could awe her with his knowledge.

[That's right. Ice cream is very cold and delicious.] Jason said. [Once I build you a new body, you can have a taste of it. You'll probably melt it once it gets too close to you, but you can still savor its sugary goodness.]

[Wow! Wowee, friend! I can't wait to taste the creamed ice!] The Phoenix chirped. [Is my matrix thingy finished yet? Is it fixed? Is it? Is it?]

She pestered him multiple times, but Jason never lost his patience. If it wasn't for the Phoenix, he would never have revived, traveled back in time, and found out that his daughter was still alive.

Jason's vision momentarily dimmed. Even if Daisy was alive, and even if he'd met his father, Phoebe was still gone.

His wife was dead.

Thinking about Phoebe... always caused a cloud of despair to swallow his mind. It was impossible to feel good about life when she had been a key driving force that always kept him going.

Right now, he stayed alive and fought for both Daisy and Hideki's sakes. But if they passed, Jason believed he wouldn't have the motivation to go on any longer.

They were his weak points. If the demons ever killed these last two people who kept him clinging to the mortal coil, Jason really didn't think he had it in him to keep living.

...

Eventually, Jason finished his work. He reignited the Cube's power source, summoned the Sentry Stars, and initialized its jump drive. The Cube leaped into P-space and began traveling out of the Hell Harbor system toward the southern edge of the Milky Way's core.

Jason left his Dronesmith inside the Cube to monitor its situation and control its progress. He activated its autonomous control mode, allowing the drone to pilot the cube without Jason's direct intervention.

Jason had long decided he would never again create clones of himself. Hope was an unfortunate accident that led to the worst disaster of Jason's entire life. Therefore, Incarnations were Jason's next best option. They were linked to his mind, and he could control them directly, but they could also be set to act autonomously, making the same general choices he would make if he controlled them, but at a fraction of the brainpower.

This allowed him to switch them to autonomous mode where they would transmit information to him, and even fight or explore on their own, but they were not clones with unique minds of their own. They were merely low-bandwidth copies of Jason's exact personality that he could retake control of at any time.

""They'd be even more effective if I instead had a MindCore installed that was focused on swarm-like manipulation of drones. I could autonomously pilot tens, hundreds, even thousands of Dronesmiths. But I wouldn't give up my GenesisFrame for anything. The ability to invent and summon objects at rapid speeds is way more valuable to me. I'll just have to deal with 'only' projecting myself into a few specific places at a time.""

One of Jason's four drones was talking to his daughter and her friends. Another was exploring the Cosmic Realm. A third was navigating the Cube to Aevum's star system.

As for the fourth one...

Jason glanced behind himself at the fourth Incarnation, which also stared at him with blank, glowing eyes.

""The demons are about to attack Heaven. Ose is attacking Area 51 for some reason. Should I intervene in one of those two situations?""

Naturally, his Incarnation did not offer a reply. Jason simply liked to talk out loud because hearing himself speak often helped sort his thoughts.

""No. My dad can handle those situations. I'll let him do what he thinks is most appropriate. Even if the demons end up utterly slaughtering all of angelkind, I won't intervene. Compared to the threat of the Psions, the demons are nothing at all. They don't even know about Demon Deities in this era. No, I need to keep my eyes on the bigger picture...""

Jason summoned his to-do list, which by now had become a lot longer and better organized.

- REACQUIRE ORIGINAL POWERS AND ABILITIES AT OR EXCEEDING PREVIOUS LEVELS (Progress: 85%)

- REBUILD INTERNAL MIND REALM; ESTABLISH NEW 'SMITHY' PROTOCOLS; RETURN BRAIN FUNCTION TO SUPERHUMAN LEVELS (Plan exchanged for new one)

- CREATE NEW MINDCORE, USE IT TO SPEED UP COMPLETION OF OTHER PLANS (Done)

- CONSTRUCT TIME ACCELERATED REALM (Progress: 47%)

- LOCATE CAMAEL'S CUBE, MOVE TO AEVUM'S STAR SECTOR (In-progress)

- CONSIDER MOVING ENTIRETY OF MARIE'S FUTURE REMNANT OASIS FACILITY TO SECRET DIMENSIONAL SPACE (Undecided)

- PROJECT 'GREAT DECEIVER' (Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Pending)

- INVESTIGATE VOLGRIM, DETERMINE THREAT LEVELS (Progress: 5%)

- EMPOWER HUMANS, REMOVE FLAW (Progress: 3%)

- PACIFY DEMONS, PREFERABLY FORM ALLIANCES, BUT EXTERMINATE IF NECESSARY (Not started)

- DETERMINE RELATIONSHIP WITH ANGELS - DECIDE BETWEEN STATUS QUO, ALLIANCE, OR EXTERMINATION (Not started)

- LOCATE BAHAMUT, SAVE PHOEBE (Not started)

- LOCATE BLACK WITCH, DETERMINE CURRENT STATUS (Not started)

...

As Jason looked at these options, his thoughts turned chaotic. There was still one entry on the list he desperately wanted to act on, but it would be selfish to jump the gun. He wanted to save Phoebe and prevent Bahamut from torturing her and all the other humans, but he had yet to look for them.

Finding out Amelia's location would be important, too. She knew the status of Leviathan and could give Jason answers about the dark dragon.

Was it Leviathan that escaped the Cube? Or was it a different 'dark dragon'? Jason wasn't sure. His intuition leaned toward the latter, but it was always possible he might have misread the situation...

Suddenly, Jason's attention shifted. He sensed an unknown entity had been teleported into the containment area of Aevum, a place Jason had told his father he could always send someone if he wanted to safeguard their life but wasn't sure if he could trust them. It wouldn't leak the existence of Aevum, and whoever was teleported there wouldn't be able to cause any serious problems. After all, the holding zone was constructed of high level reinforced Wordsmithium...

When Jason investigated the newcomer, he was slightly startled.

""Her? How could it be her?""

Jason opted to send his final Dronesmith into the containment area. There, he found a woman with white hair spilling out of her helmet, her angelic wings unmoving as she lay on the ground, dazed and injured.

""Cassiel...?"" Jason asked, as he approached her.

The woman stirred. Despite wearing a helmet that covered her face, Jason knew what she looked like. He had seen her in the future, after all.

""Ugh... you... who are you?"" Cassiel asked. ""Where is this place?""

She found herself inside a metal warehouse-like area. Not too large, big enough to fit a few trucks inside, with medical devices, containers filed with various food types, and other assorted items strewn around in a fairly efficient hospital-like layout.

""My name is Jason Hiro."" Jason replied. ""I am the Archseer.""

Cassiel raised her head. She looked at him through the slits in her helmet and frowned.

""You? You're that second Trueborn? Raphael has spoken of you.""

Jason knelt beside her. ""Are you injured? This facility can heal you.""

Cassiel clutched her ribs and winced. ""Emperor Lucifer... ugh... she struck me a most grievous blow. I'm lucky I didn't perish on the spot. How did I even arrive here?""

""My father brought you."" Jason said, taking care not to reveal too many details. ""Here, let me help you up. Rest in this chair. The time flow here is quite fast. If you spend a day here, only a few minutes will pass in the real world.""

She nodded at him, but her movements were guarded. ""In that case, I offer my thanks, Archseer.""

""Just call me Jason, Cassiel."" Jason said, as he took her hand and pulled her to her feet.

When she stood up, she looked at him and frowned. ""So I didn't mishear. You called me that name again. You must have me confused with someone else. My name is _not_ Cassiel. She was one of the ancient Archangels. She is long dead.""

""Oh! That's right."" Jason said, suddenly remembering she never actually told him her name. ""Then how should I address you?""

Cassiel looked at him for a moment, then shook her head.

""Heaven's Daughter is just fine. My name is... not important anymore. I am not worthy of it.""

Jason raised an eyebrow. _What did she mean by that, exactly?_

""Alright. That name's a bit clunky, but it'll do."" Jason replied.

As 'Heaven's Daughter' sat in the lounging chair and relaxed a bit, she merely nodded.

1n4wg9b,https://v.redd.it/i8eruigt9dmf1,What‚Äôs a Question That Can Turn a Stranger into a Friend?,"Ask: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs something you‚Äôre excited about these days?‚Äù It invites a story, signals care, and opens a path to real connection.

Scope & Definition

We meet strangers every day‚Äîon trains, in lines, at conferences. Most encounters stay shallow because our openers are shallow. ‚ÄúWhat do you do?‚Äù sorts people into bins. ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù yields geography, not meaning. A better first move is a question that spotlights energy rather than status: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs something you‚Äôre excited about these days?‚Äù

This question works because it‚Äôs present-tense (not a r√©sum√©), permission-giving (answer can be big or small), and identity-adjacent (values live where excitement lives). Think of it as a social tuning fork. Hit it, and resonance spreads through the conversation.

What Can Be Proven / What Cannot Be Proven

What we can say with confidence: open-ended questions that invite self-disclosure increase liking and rapport. Asking someone about what matters to them often unlocks longer, more vivid answers, which create more psychological ‚Äúhooks‚Äù for follow-ups. You get story, not stats.

What we can‚Äôt promise: no question guarantees friendship. People have different moods, contexts, and boundaries. Timing matters. Safety matters. The aim isn‚Äôt magic; it‚Äôs probability‚Äînudging the odds toward warmth and shared ground.

Counterarguments & Misconceptions

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that too personal?‚Äù
It‚Äôs personal-adjacent, not invasive. ‚ÄúThese days‚Äù narrows the scope and makes it optional. People can talk about a hobby, a podcast, their basil plant, or their PhD‚Äîwhatever feels safe.

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt it sound corny?‚Äù
Delivery beats wording. Ask with real curiosity and a small smile. If it still feels stiff, soften it: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs been fun for you lately?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat are you tinkering with for pure enjoyment?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if they say ‚Äònothing‚Äô?‚Äù
That‚Äôs information too. You can pivot: ‚ÄúTotally fair. What would you like to be excited about?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat used to light you up?‚Äù

Frame the Question: Necessity vs. Benefit

No, you don‚Äôt need one perfect question to make friends. People connect through repetition, proximity, and shared goals. But a well-crafted opener benefits you by compressing the path to substance. It sets the tone: we‚Äôre trading real answers, not job titles.

Boundary-wise, use public, low-stakes contexts first; avoid forcing it during obviously private moments. If the vibe is closed, switch to lighter ground.

Philosophical Lens: Ian Hacking and the ‚ÄúInteractive Kind‚Äù

Philosopher of science Ian Hacking wrote about ‚Äúinteractive kinds‚Äù‚Äîcategories that change the people inside them because they know they‚Äôre being categorized. Conversations do something similar. When you ask about excitement, you‚Äôre not classifying; you‚Äôre inviting. The other person chooses how to self-describe in real time. That choice shapes the next minute of reality. The category (‚ÄúI‚Äôm someone who loves urban gardening‚Äù) feeds back into the interaction, creating a loop where identity and dialogue co-produce each other.

From Explanation to Prediction

Why it works: it cues positive affect, offers autonomy, and invites narrative.

What that predicts: richer follow-ups and faster convergence on shared threads. For example:

In a coffee line: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs something you‚Äôre excited about these days?‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúFinally fixing my bike.‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúWhat was the trickiest part?‚Äù Now you‚Äôve got competence, story, and possibly shared routes.
First day at work: Ask a teammate. You‚Äôll hear projects, passions, and hidden skills you‚Äôd otherwise learn months later.
At a meetup: You‚Äôll surface niche overlaps (‚ÄúI‚Äôm learning sourdough scoring‚Äù) that make future hangouts obvious (‚ÄúTeach me on Saturday?‚Äù).
Interpretability Trade-Offs

Openers live on a spectrum. A narrow question (‚ÄúWhich team do you support?‚Äù) is interpretable but shallow. A broad one (‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your life story?‚Äù) is deep but burdensome. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs something you‚Äôre excited about these days?‚Äù hits a pragmatic middle: high signal, low pressure.

Trade-offs to mind:

Validation vs. Opacity: You won‚Äôt always know if the other person enjoyed the exchange. Look for micro-signals (eyes brighten, longer sentences, questions back).
Openness vs. Safety: If the answer veers sensitive, follow their lead and avoid prying.
Trust vs. Tactics: The question should serve the person, not your agenda. Curiosity first, networking second.
Practical Implications + One Applied QuestionString

Use it as a doorway, not a destination. After the first answer, you need scaffolding. Mirror a phrase they used, ask for a small example, and offer a slice of your own excitement to balance the exchange. Keep your answers as crisp and concrete as theirs.

üß¨QuestionStrings to Practice

QuestionStrings are deliberately ordered sequences of questions in which each answer fuels the next, creating a compounding ladder of insight that drives progressively deeper understanding.

What‚Äôs something you‚Äôre excited about these days?
How did you first get into it?
What‚Äôs the underrated hard part that outsiders miss?
What have you learned about yourself through it?
What‚Äôs a tiny next step you‚Äôre looking forward to?
Run this ladder, and you‚Äôll usually arrive at character, not just content.

Closing Thought

A good opener is like striking a tuning fork. You don‚Äôt force the music; you offer resonance.

This alone would make them very appealing to many. But on top of that, they are very competitively priced even with shipping  you can easily find amazing scent DNAs for $20/50ml (with extra essence, no less).  Which brings me to the last thing that intrigues me about Shobi: customization. Being able to add extra ""essence"" is very cool, imo. I feel like right now the community is starting to find what works on this front but over time we will find optimal ratios. 

So cool.  

On the flipside, Shobi is based in Greece. That's far from North America. So that means a couple of things, mainly that it takes a while to get to your doorstep and shipping is slightly high (‚Ç¨15 flat fee). So you got to have patience (as with Jomashop) and you are better off buying more bottles since the shipping cost stays constant. Next drawback is that they are new. So there isn't a ton of information out there. People on this sub have done an amazing job at disseminating what info we had on a limited amount of examples. Some are great, some not so much...but if your putting in an order it's likely that you'll have to truly ""blind buy"" because there may not be any feedback available for that particular scent. 

One other thing to mention is that competition is getting very hot in the clone space. Newer entries like Arabiat Prestige, Bujairami, Le Falcone, Assaf, Laverne...etc means that we have more choices and many times it means better quality / cheaper alternatives (or both). Then you have Montagne, who is already in the States, doesn't charge shipping in the US and does top quality work, generally. 

All this to say, there are factors to consider when buying from Shobi

------------------------------------------

**Quick note:** All bottles are 50ml in size. I did not consider how close it was to the OG as a part of the rating. However, I did consider how well related dupes were (naturally those frags with little or no competition benefit). No real consideration to performance, my gut says they will all be above average and there may be improvement with more time. Also, I haven't tested them properly - so I left performance out.  

All frags were received in July 17 and last tested on August 31. I didn't want to review earlier and face the wrath of Low-Stomach üòÅ.

*Alright let's get to the reviews....*   

**Fragrance Cloning:**  VIRGIN ISLAND WATER   
**Extra essence:** 2ml  
**Main Notes:**  Lime, Coconut, White Rum   
**Quick Thoughts:**  This one is real nice! Smelled pretty damn good when I first got it too. Rum took weeks to develop but it's there and it's nice. Coconut is very smooth. Only wish the lime was a *bit* more pronounced. Well worth it since there's no real clone competition for this scent profile. Big fan of the scent profile overall.  
**Rating:** 8.25 out of 10  

**Fragrance Cloning:**  AQVA POUR HOMME   ATLANTIQVE  
**Extra essence:** 2ml  
**Main Notes:**  Ambergris, Bergamot, Resin   
**Quick Thoughts:**  Holy Ambergris! LOL. Very strong marine vibe, somewhat similar to Lattafa Atlas. Bergamot is there and resin sorta lingers in the background to give some depth. Became more complex and stronger over the weeks...but I can't put my finger on what changed exactly. Might be the amberish accord evolving. I have Aqva Marine, and I like that one more, but this has better performance.  
**Rating:** 7.25 out of 10  

**Fragrance Cloning:**  MUGLER AMEN PURE MALT   
**Extra essence:** 3ml  
**Main Notes:**  Malt, Peat, Vanilla  
**Quick Thoughts:**  Malt bomb with only cameos by peat and vanilla. Really reminds me of brewing beer. Sweet hot barley/grain. Powdery sort of vanilla. Got darker over the weeks and the malt note gained depth. To me, this is way better than Star Men Nebula, but it also costs around the same price (actually more, per ml). The kicker is that this is also potent with 3ml of extra essence so it's a beast.  
**Rating:** 7.5 out of 10   

**Fragrance Cloning:**  MUGLER AMEN ULTRA ZEST  
**Extra essence:** 2ml  
**Main Notes:**  Orange, Coffee, Vanilla    
**Quick Thoughts:**  This scent profile is so unique. I really dig it! The rindy orange the coffee lingering in the background and the vanilla giving off creamscicle vibes. I think it stands out from other citrus DNAs. Again, I wish the orange was a bit sharper and juicier here.  
**Rating:**  7.75 out of 10   

**Fragrance Cloning:**  PLUM JAPONAIS   
**Extra essence:** 3ml  
**Main Notes:**  Plum, Cinnamon, Oud   
**Quick Thoughts:**  I had high hopes for this one. My partner actually wanted it as well so, why not. Was weaker than excepted when I first got it. Even now, I don't really get plum. I get ""fruity"" but plum is very hit or miss for me (can't stand Vintage Radio ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). Slight cinnamon and dark woods. My gut tells me this one needs to sit longer...it's not done developing. With that said, Montagne's version is way superior (at almost twice the price, mind you).   
**Rating:** 7 out of 10   

**Fragrance Cloning:**  LE BEAU PARADISE GARDEN  
**Extra essence:** 2ml   
**Main Notes:**  Coconut, Green Notes, Fig   
**Quick Thoughts:**  Did not like this when I first got it. All I got was creamy coconut and fig. Very flat overall. Now it's one of my favorites here. Green notes developed nicely, tho I wish they was a little more of it. Prefer this to Cosmic Giardino but Hawas Tropical is *slightly* better overall (has a diffusive character I enjoy).   
**Rating:** 8 out of 10   

**Fragrance Cloning:**  GUCCI GUILTY ELIXIR   
**Extra essence:** 2ml   
**Main Notes:**  Orange Blossom, Vanilla, Ambrofix  
**Quick Thoughts:**  Right out the gate it was literally only vanilla and nothing else. I was repulsed. Over the weeks the white floral notes developed and it became more balanced. Although the floral notes do still have a synthetic characteristic, almost like plastic. You have to really try to isolate it, but it's there. I do love this DNA and although not cloning the same, I MUCH prefer Shiyaaka Silver and Sotoor Taa. I have a cheap clone of MYSLF that is also superior (Camara Mystique).  
**Rating:** 6.75 out of 10   

**Fragrance Cloning:**  DARK REBEL   
**Extra essence:** 3ml  
**Main Notes:**  Tobacco, Rum, Leather     
**Quick Thoughts:**  This one also got shades darker over time. Initially there was zero rum note. The spiced rum only developed in the last couple weeks. Now it the poster child for the masculine triumphant: Booze, Tobacco and Leather. These notes are well balanced. The Tobacco is slightly ashy and the leather is dark (duh). Very potent. I'd bet it gets better with time...   
**Rating:** 8 out of 10.  
 
**Fragrance Cloning:**  GNTONIC  
**Extra essence:** 2ml  
**Main Notes:**  Gin, Lime, Tonic   
**Quick Thoughts:**  Very weak on day one. But again, came to life after weeks. With this one the herbaceous nature eventually showed itself - some mint and touch of ginger. The gin note is very distinct and well done. Needs more lime! LOL. And a little more tonic ""sparkle"" too (could be too much essence, idk). Very simple kind of scent but also very likeable. This was the biggest surprise. Turned out to be incredibly pleasant.    
**Rating:** 7.5 out of 10  

**Fragrance Cloning:**  TERRE D'HERMES EAU INTENSE VETIVER   
**Extra essence:** 2ml  
**Main Notes:**  Vetiver, Bergamot, Sichuan Pepper 
**Quick Thoughts:**  I'm starting to realize that I really love the Vetiver/Citrus profile. This one had very mild Vetiver initially. Also, zero pepper sharpness. Bergamot was there the whole time. Only in the past week or two has the Vetiver really bloomed. WOW. Blew me away!! Went from ""meh"" to outstanding. Nice blend, great balance too. The ""rounded"" nature of the citrus actually works perfectly here. A touch of Sichuan Pepper is nice but it's somewhat light. I like this every bit as much as FA's Pierce and more than Fattan.  
**Rating:** 9 out of 10  

**Closing Thoughts:** Very happy to have picked these up. Having Shobi as another resource to get clones not otherwise accessible or at a much better price point is definitely useful. And that will be it's role in my collection. Would not pause going to Shobi for scents I can't reliably get from Montagne or a quality ME dupe house. Ofc, some of these frags seem to need a bit more development so I wouldn't call these ratings final. But even if they were, 7 of the 10 I would have bought knowing what I know now. Nor would I be surprised if one or more of the bottom 3 end up with a higher score too.  

As for specifics, it's true, their citrus notes are muted. So, for the most part, you may want to consider alternative if you're going for a citrus-centric frag. Almost all frags with booze took a while for that note to develop. Lastly, 3ml extra essence is great with the darker/woodier profiles while less essence seems appropriate. Like I think GNToinc would be better with only 1ml extra essence. Could be that adding 2ml of extra essence  made a light profile ""heavier"" and took away some of the sparkle I love.  

Oh and one more thing, there's a guide produced by LS and some other posts that were SUPER helpful. Search them out and use them before ordering.  

Anyways that's it for me, cheers. Hope y'all found this helpful.  ",11,1756650838.0,fragranceclones,10,1.0,False

After a year of using our Chemex with boiled water in saucepan, I got an Ode grinder and Stagg kettle for my birthday 6 months ago. Since then I have been ordering beans from different roasters as there is only one bag from a local grocery store that is drinkable (Ethiopian  Yirgacheffe from Copper Horse in Ithaca, NY).
Following the suggestion from a post in this sub, I ordered these two bags from 19 and they are fantastic at a great price. 
Another recent find was Overlook Coffee in upstate NY. This anaerobic honey caturra was really nice (and they have a sale now!)

S, it‚Äôs been 10 months and I know you don‚Äôt want to hear me. And that‚Äôs ok. You can block me after this.

If this letter ever turns up in your email inbox at all, then just know that it means my country is turning out for the worst. It means I‚Äôm about to leave wherever I am now, and evacuating, but the chances of me surviving may be little, and I have nothing left to lose if I destroy your peace for 5 minutes to get out how I feel for you.

Even after so long, I still miss everything we had. Even if it honestly sucked, even if you and I are never meant to be in any universe, I would give anything to have one more happy hour with you.

You still linger in my everything. Sometimes, I still see shadows of you. In the library, in a song, in a coffee shop, in malls - like a phantom. Every so often, I still hear whispers of you. In a song, in a game, in a story. You're still in every presence of my life and I hate it so much.

When I hear Germany, something wraps tightly around my chest. Everytime I look at my life now, I wonder if you would have loved the me I have become. And maybe you would.

Some days, I see an email and then I thought it was you. And then it was not. Some days I dream of you and I thought it was real, but then again it wasn't.

You know, they say if you and the other person have learned the lesson you need to learn, you will never meet each other again. But I still see you everywhere I go. Apparently, you'll just continue to be a shadow in my life until I do something. I just don't know what it can be.

S, please check on Y and that girl whose name I forgot. They might really need support right now. Even in a place in which they feel safe, they need support, because watching their families have to possibly go through this without them may be hard.

As for me, if you‚Äôre reading this, know I‚Äôve accepted whatever comes. Thank you for a love that‚Äôs now lost but never erased. If there‚Äôs ever another life, I hope I can love you the way you deserve.

So, here‚Äôs the rabbit hole I fell down‚Äîthe **TOP 7 legit apps paying REAL PEOPLE to test their new features in 2025**. I mean it: I triple-checked. There‚Äôs no weird sketch, and shockingly, some pay INSTANTLY.

- **1. UTest**  
Classic but still crushing it. Known for solid pay, and I swear some gigs dropped $15-25 for like 30 mins of ‚Äúplaying around‚Äù with a new feature!

- **2. UserTesting**  
Literally hit record, talk through a site or feature, and BOOM‚Äî$10 per test, instantly into PayPal. Once had a $60 day just poking around a new shopping app!

- **3. TestApp at [https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  
I found this and thought, ‚ÄúYeah right.‚Äù But it‚Äôs LEGIT. They‚Äôre snatching up normal folks for BETA (!!!) features. And they LOVE feedback. Some weeks, it paid out more than my sketchy gig apps.  
**Highlight:** Super quick sign-up, immediate tasks, real cashouts. I never waited more than 24 hours for payment.

- **4. PlaytestCloud**  
Not just for gamers! They pay you for honest ‚Äúis this fun or is this TRASH?‚Äù vibes. And feedback is everything to them.

- **5. TryMyUI**  
Bizarrely satisfying? Reviews are ‚Äúam I being punk‚Äôd!?‚Äù but then the money lands in your PayPal.

- **6. BetaFamily**  
This one‚Äôs worldwide and low-key SLEEPER status. You‚Äôre not just beta testing, you pick your clients and apps‚Äîhello, CONTROL.

- **7. Respondent**  
For the survey/test hybrid crew. Some mobile app feature tests paid $50+ for 20 mins of talking about onboarding screens (HOWW???)

Everything is so MINIMAL EFFORT‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs a legit side hustle stack if you want it.

Final verdict:  
If you like free apps, tech, or just want to pay for Uber Eats doing basically WHAT YOU DO ALREADY‚Äîtest these. Especially **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**.  
You don‚Äôt have to have a fancy phone, either. The wildest part? Some of these run on literal potatoes.

1n4w5mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1n4w5mu/war_for_the_kingdom_of_the_mole_men/,War For The Kingdom Of The Mole Men,"The Kit was gone.

It had been entrusted to James, and he had taken it. Inside the Kit was 10,000 dollars.  And pills. That was why he had taken it, E was sure of it. But there was more in the Kit. There were letters. And pictures of ‚Äòcilla.

Red get the boys and fan out, James took the Kit. There‚Äôs a car missing. The Lincoln.  He‚Äôll be headed for the airport.

Red spoke into a phone on the wall, then hung it up.

The boys are in town, I‚Äôll get ‚Äòem E, we‚Äôll meet you there.

I‚Äôll meet you at the airport Red.

Beside the door a string of keys. Red grabbed the nearest set, the ones with dice on. them. The door slammed after him.  Slapping leather on concrete then the fire of combustion,
cold gasoline vaporized inside eight cylinders and the squeal of tires.

Big E donned a cape. A revolver, a police special, rested in a specially sewed pocket of
his jumpsuit.

His sunglasses darkened the mid July sun of Tennessee. He had chosen the keys to a
Cadillac, and the ignition turned. The transmission in gear the pedal on the floor. Loose gravel
danced behind him, kicked into a window of the house, a mohawk of rock and dirt and anger
and dinosaur bones.

It would take time for Red to get to town, and the boys. He knew a back road, a ring road around town. Bootlegger route from Prohibition. 

James would go that way.

The hardball highway under his wheels. He flashed his lights, and waved a federal badge at cars ahead of him and they pulled over. Several miles ahead a dirt road to the right.

He took it, fishtailing the Cadillac, turned into the skid, gunned the motor.

The road climbed a gentle hill, broadleaf hardwoods swayed in the wake of American horsepower. Ahead the road turkey tracked, a sharp turn to the left and a gentle grade to the
right. The center, a two track path, kudzu crushed by recent tire tracks. He stopped the car.
The tire tracks matched the tread pattern of the Lincoln. 

He pursued.

The suspension rocked and the low slung frame of the Cadillac dragged against baked puddle edges and his speed was reduced by necessity, drag marks ahead were fresh. His
confidence grew with his rage.

Another mile and glint in the forest, then a clearing. An ancient farmhouse. 

Overgrown by kudzu and broken vehicles and barrels and gutted furniture and rusted tools. 

Beside the house, the Lincoln.

He pulled behind it, parking to box in and deny escape. 

Revolver in hand he ripped from the drivers seat.

James! James! Get over here!

There was no sound but the clicking of the hot engine.

He scanned, no movement. He kicked open the farmhouse door. 

Pack rats and possums had left their smell and their detritus, but the house held no higher life. His white cowboy boots thud on a molded Persian rug. A hollow sound beneath. He moved the rug. 

A trap door. 

He opened it. A stairwell into darkness.  He examined the stairs.  Fresh prints.

Tony Llamas.

James.

He possessed no external light source, but a cigarette lighter, and he fashioned a torch out of packrat sticks and shredded rags.

James, I‚Äôm coming after you man, and if you don‚Äôt come out now I‚Äôm going to hurt you,
bad.

He descended the stairs. 

Ancient timbers supported the hand hewn tunnel descending
at a 45 degree angle. The stairs were wooden, rotten, some creaked, some were broken in
times past, some broken recently, some broke under his boot. He fed more strips of cloth to the torch. No markings on the wall, save for pick ruts and chisel marks in the harder rock.

The stairs switchbacked and the air grew warm. His sideburns fluttered with a breeze in his face that smelled of pancakes and maple syrup. Far ahead a light glowed, narrow from distance, blue hued. He drew the revolver and approached carefully, not for concern of ambush, but for concern of the fragile stairs.

James! Last warning man. There‚Äôs still time to smooth this out!

The blue light ahead darkened, then reappeared.

If this is about the money, you could just ask, man!

The tunnel turned. Mushrooms on the ceiling of a small room. A body in the center. Not James‚Äô somebody else, an ancient body with rotting denim overalls shrouding mushroom cracked bones. Beside the body lay a sword. He examined it. The scabbard was wood, ornate, black and gold etchings. The steel shined blue, and was free of rust.

Karate sword, he knew. 

The curve of the blade and the hardness of the steel, Damascus. 

A dragon etched into the blade.
‚ÄúTerminus Est,‚Äù written on the handle. 

He felt power when he gripped the handle. Hungry power.

A silk strap was affixed to both ends of the scabbard, and he placed it over his shoulder,
moving his cape for ease of access.

Down the tunnel shuffling, a muffled scrape and strained creaks of tested wood.

James! I made it this far, and I‚Äôm still willing to forget all this man.

There was no answer.

He fed a strip of the dead man‚Äôs overalls to the torch, and waited
The sound stopped several paces away, still shrouded in darkness. He waited, pistol
trained at the opening of the tunnel. 

Then a being leapt into the room. Muscles covered by thick fur, adorned with belts of human skulls. The beast stood high, a head or two taller than him, and peered down with a head covered in dirty fur, a snout protruding, two yellowed teeth at
the front, each as big as a man‚Äôs thumb, it held a crude club, rebar with a cinder block on the
end.

E stood still, not from fear, he was Army trained, and an accomplished Karateman. It
was the oddity of the thing before him. A creature not of this world, from before the time God
banished Behemoth and Leviathan. A remanent of a past world full of sin and evil and
savagery. The giant creature readied its improvised club, and he shot it with the police special.

Two rounds of .357 tore through the chest of the creature, ripped coffee can sized holes through
the back. The creature stumbled, then fell backwards. 

He examined the body. The fur was fine, thick, like that on a dog‚Äôs face. There were eyes, but they were mere slits, tiny ears sat upon the thing‚Äôs head. The snout was also like a dog‚Äôs, extended several inches, the two large front teeth gave way to rows of small ones, separated by a rough gray tongue.

The body was like that of a man‚Äôs. But the claws. Five on each finger, six inches or
longer. 

He touched one, it was hard, chipped, caked in dirt. He counted the skulls around the
thing‚Äôs waist, seven, some large, but two were small, children‚Äôs size.

Mole men, just like in the movies, Lord Jesus.

He calculated his options. He had four rounds left in the revolver, and he knew his torch
wouldn‚Äôt last the ascent. He would be trapped if he stayed in this place or continued. 

But James had the Kit. And he needed it back.

He gathered what was left of the tattered overalls, added them to the torch, and walked the tunnel of the beast‚Äôs origin.

More wooden steps. Five of them. Then nothing.

He stepped into air and fell, tumbling through warm darkness. 

He fell faster than the torch and its light danced into his view every few seconds as he spun head over boots in the
darkness. Then the torch unraveled and there was no light. Only wind and blackness. 

He began to panic, but summoned an inner calm. He reached one corner of his rhinestone cape, and then another, and held it out like a wing. The increased drag stabilized his fall, Army training took over, and positioned his feet below him like a paratrooper.

He glided untold minutes. Meditation controlled his mind, and the fear of the darkness
was pushed down, replaced with a calm readiness. 

More untold minutes and a glow appeared below him. Orange and yellow and warm.

He glided toward the light. A cloudbank, or fog, he wasn‚Äôt sure. His cowboy boots
pierced the cloudbank and he was buffeted by turbulence, condensation on his sideburns and eyebrows. 

More descent. And the light grew brighter.

Soon he was through the cloud bank. Below him a vast and green landscape. A box canyon covered in clouds, dazzlingly bright mushrooms lining the sides. Foliage below, and a
massive tower, cobblestone square. Houses.

Holy moley, I found the center of the Earth, man.

The updrafts were strong, and harnessed them to slow him and to gently land. He did so, in the square.

He was in a village. The stone tower stood 300 feet tall, a stone snake constricted its way around the vertical length of it over and over from the bottom to the top. 

Huts of mud and thatched roofs surrounded the square, some larger buildings were made of stone and unknown timber, and large white material.

Bone. Behemoth‚Äôs bones built these buildings.

WHO DARE ENTER MY KINGDOM?

A voice from everywhere echoed in his ears. The sound shook his teeth and vibrated his sideburns.

He looked around. There was no one speaking. Inside the nearest hut he saw something peak out at him. A creature, small, timid looking.

I SAID WHO DARE ENTER!? FLYING SKY MAN! SPEAK! I AM THE WIZARD BRANCH HEMLOCK, HEWER OF TREES AND MEN, SLAYER OF THE THE CRIMINAL GADIANTON, CAMBRIAN OF THE EARTH, AND KING OF THIS REALM AND I DEMAND YOU SPEAK OR SUFFER YOUR VERY DEATH!

Whoa man, I‚Äôm a bit of a King myself.

YOU DARE TO CHALLENGE MY POWER!?

From the top of the tower, a man jumped and fell at fast speed toward him. 

The man landed gently 20 or so paces from him, he felt the breeze of his wake buffet him.
The man was old, long hair, a white beard past his chest. Black adorned robe covered a
skinny frame, a tall pointy hat similarly adorned with moons and stars atop his head. He carried a sword and spoke in a rasp. 

A wizard. A wizard king.

A king? A king has come to challenge me for my kingdom? I see.

No business here but my own. I came looking for my man, he took something from me,
and I‚Äôm going to take it back.

The wizard king squinted, then turned and spoke words unpronounceable in a human
mouth. A dozen mole men emerged from the stone building, all crisscrossed with human skulls and other grisly accouterments. 

They drug a mangled body behind them.

James.

So, So Called King, is this your man?

My man was alive when he fled, and though he did me wrong, he‚Äôs still my own. I had no quarrel with you man, but now I do.

SO BE IT!

The mole men dropped James‚Äô body and charged. He knew the revolver was of no use, so he left it in his jumpsuit. The karate sword unsheathed, he drew a defensive combat stance.

The creatures balked their charge.

WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

I found it, man.

BLASPHEMY!

The wizard king stepped into the sky, non-Euclidean geometries of lights dancing from his
fingers, arcing toward him, fire and death and heat and hate and off key music followed. 

He executed a karate roll and missed the first salvo, then another. A third struck close, and a fourth was a direct hit, but the light and the heat was absorbed into the sword. 

He felt a power surge through him, transmitted from the wizard king  to the light to the sword to him. 

He took a step and felt the ground soften. He looked down and he was floating. He took another step and gained
elevation.

Below him, hundreds more mole men emerged from huts and buildings and nearby forests and fields, and sank to one knee as they watched the duel of kings.

The wizard flung more light and fireballs at him, and he absorbed them with the blade, power surging through him.

IT CAN‚ÄôT BE! NOT LIKE THIS!

He closed to within a dozen paces of the man in the sky, drew the police special, and
fired four rounds into the wizard king‚Äôs head. The man fell to the ground, dead.

He descended to the corpse, and touched the blade to the man‚Äôs body. Unimaginable
power gripped him as the blade drew the magic. Memories that were not his flooded his mind,
and knowledge of 10,000 years of forgotten secrets.

He stepped into the sky, sword held above him. The molemen fell to both knees and let out an unworldly sound. 

A sound of rejoice.

You‚Äôre free now baby, all of you. But if you stick with me, we got a lotta business to take

Just published my first book on KDP. It's a rom-com with some quirky and weirdness. Please check it out if you have kindle unlimited. Excuse the book cover as well, I have a professional one incoming.

Here's my blurb:

At twenty-eight, Marissa Wright has perfected the art of being alone. She serves coffee to people with their lives figured out, rates families like they're Yelp reviews, and has an unusual hobby: breaking into houses to experience what ""perfect"" family life feels like. It's creepy, sure, but it's also the closest she's ever gotten to belonging somewhere. Until the night she picks the wrong house. Dan Brooks is a widower learning to live again, and the last thing he expects to find is a strange woman in his bedroom making coffee and wearing his late wife's fuzzy socks. He should call the police. Instead, he finds himself oddly charmed by this quirky criminal who talks to kitchen appliances and knows more about his daily routine than his own sister. What starts as the world's most awkward meet-cute turns into something neither of them saw coming: a chance to build the family they've both been missing. But can a reformed house-breaker and a grieving widower figure out how to let someone in the front door instead of climbing through the window? Will Marissa learn that the best families aren't found‚Äîthey're built?

I'm hanging out at certain places from time to time and it's always great to team up if you know what I mean, but I can't help but feel anxious when I'm hanging out with less-fortunate passing trans people. I'm afraid of getting hate-crimed, I'm afraid I'll get recognized and get clocked too, I'm afraid of all kinds of things even though I don't really have people in my life where I have to be afraid. The thing is, I planned everything very careful to life stealth-ish in my neighbourhood; I just don't want to be outed, I feel like when there is a clocky one besides me, people will clock me too - basically a *clock by association*. The more clocky ones, the worse it gets. 

This is something I have going on since I started transition 10+ years ago and I really don't like this part of myself. I get invited all the time by early transitioners and they're really great people, we have a great time, but I just can't hang out with them in everyday life, grabbing a coffee or something. I then dodge people and end friendships. It's not even due to voices not passing, some people are just really clocky, not even in the brick-y sense. Sorry for all of this immature internet slang but I don't know how else to put it. I also had hoped this would change after SRS, as I don't really feel 'trans' anymore, I just happen to be - but it kind of got worse. Also not saying I'm super pretty or the passing-queen, but it still is what it is.

My short term goal is to sell inkjet prints for charity and in the longer term I would like to produce my own book via commercial printing. 

I have tried everything I know using Photoshop, including downloading the digital images posted on the original photographer's website and trying color match with them, using a Nix spectro on the printed pages in the book, adjusting the digital color with gradient maps, blend-if layer options and other tricks learnt from Photoshop experts. Using my inkjet printer, the prints are always slightly off, either too warm or too cool and I just cannot get th
