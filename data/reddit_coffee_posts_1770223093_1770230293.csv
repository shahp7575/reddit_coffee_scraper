1qvwfqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qvwfqa/i_want_to_turn_my_life_around_and_become_an/,"I want to turn my life around and become an overachiever, but I feel like I’m starting from zero","I’ve been thinking a lot lately and felt the need to put this into words.
Throughout my school life, I stayed in my shell. I never participated in activities because of stage fright and social anxiety. I also come from a place where extracurricular activities weren’t really encouraged, so opportunities were limited to begin with. Whenever I wanted to try something, I was usually discouraged.
You might assume that since I didn’t have hobbies, I would’ve been great at studies. That wasn’t the case. I was an average student in subjects like history, maths, literature, and languages, and I barely passed science-related subjects. The one thing I genuinely enjoyed was sketching, and I was above average at it, but I was never enrolled in any classes or clubs.
When I needed to earn money, I took tuition for a student from 4th to 7th standard. Later, I did some very basic social media work mainly posting Instagram stories for a local coffee shop. I wouldn’t call it a real skill, and because of that, I don’t feel confident offering freelancing services.
Currently, I’m enrolled in a non-attending university pursuing a Bachelor’s in Commerce, and alongside that, I’m doing a professional course to become a compliance officer. For the first time in my life, I want to truly overachieve. I don’t want to just “get by” anymore.
Right now, I don’t have access to many extracurricular opportunities, but I do have my studies. My goal is to excel academically aim for first rank, earn awards, certificates, and prove to myself that I’m capable of more than what my past reflects.
What hurts the most is feeling like my school life is a blank page. I didn’t have many friends, I didn’t build skills, and I didn’t create memories. Looking back, it feels like I wasted those years not because I wanted to, but because I didn’t know how to do better.
I know changing your life is difficult and exhausting, but I don’t want to keep living on autopilot. I want to look back one day and know exactly where I spent my time and what I worked for.

At first, I thought it was just buildup from grease and scraps, so I tried plunging it hard with a cup plunger, which cleared it temporarily but the problem came right back after a few days of normal use.

I poured in some enzyme drain cleaner from the hardware store, letting it sit overnight like the bottle said, and that helped for maybe two weeks before the sluggish flow started again, especially with coffee grounds or rice going down.

Checked under the sink and the P-trap was full of gunk, so I disassembled it, cleaned out the sludge with a wire hanger, and put it back – worked fine for a bit, but now it's clogging deeper in the line, maybe 10-15 feet down where I can't reach with my snake tool.

The backup is causing water to leak from the disposal seal too, dripping onto the cabinet floor and risking mold under there since it's particle board that swells up easy.

I finally had Jumbo Plumbing St. Thomas handle the full cleanout with their power auger, which got to the root of the blockage – turned out to be a mix of hair, soap scum, and old pipe corrosion narrowing the drain.

They replaced a short section of rusted cast iron with PVC to prevent future issues, and now it drains like new without any backups.

For prevention in an older system like this, what's the best routine – like monthly hot water flushes or specific cleaners that won't eat the pipes? Any tips on installing a better disposal that handles scraps without clogging so often?",1,1770229166.0,PlumbingRepair,1,1.0,False

Dear \[Agent\],

I am pleased to present my novel THE TIME BETWEEN US, a nostalgic, emo-tinged story about love, grief and finding peace with the hurt we inherit, for your consideration.

For most of her life thirty-four-year-old Charlotte Bautista has successfully avoided facing her commitment issues. But after ending yet another relationship and losing her beloved cat, Charlotte is finally ready to confront the root of her problems—her controlling mother. She takes a trip to her childhood home in hopes of finding comfort and clarity, and instead finds the last thing she would expect: a time portal hidden behind her old bedroom TV. One touch sends Charlotte hurtling back to 2008: the era of Myspace, emo playlists, and digital cameras, where she wakes up in her seventeen-year-old body with all her adult memories intact.

She reconnects with her high school boyfriend, Sebastian, who reveals he’s been pulled from the future too, reigniting a love they never truly let go of. Recently divorced and unhappy with his adult life, Sebastian wants to rewrite his past and urges Charlotte to do the same. But as Charlotte lives under her mother’s roof again with the perspective of adulthood, she knows it’s time to come to terms with her mother’s alcoholism and controlling behavior.

While Sebastian wants to rewrite the past, Charlotte comes to realize that healing means leaving it behind. To return to the future, she must confront the pain her mother caused, and trust the love she and Sebastian now share is strong enough to stand the test of time.  

Complete at 86,000 words, THE TIME BETWEEN US will appeal to readers who enjoyed the family-centered time travel of *This Time Tomorrow* by Emma Straub and the romantic magic of *The Seven Year Slip* by Ashley Poston.

Thank you for your time!

  
FIRST 300 : 

I don’t know if it’s the coffee stain on my shirt, getting flicked off in traffic, or the fact that I’m ten minutes late to my first ever therapy session, but I’m pissed.

“Welcome Charlotte, have a seat,” my therapist says, gesturing to a plushy grey sofa to his right. He lowers himself into a nice leather armchair and sets a clipboard down on his lap. “I know you filled out a brief application form before arriving, but I’d like to hear in your own words what brought you here today.”

I dutifully sit down on the sofa across from him, arranging my blouse to hopefully hide most of the coffee I spilled over it, and try not to let my resting bitch face take center stage. As per usual, my first instinct is to answer with dripping sarcasm. *My Kia brought me most of the way and after that my legs, how about you?* But I don’t want to scare the therapist in the first five minutes of our session, so I hold back and instead give a small, impatient shrug.

“Well, I wanted to work on myself, I guess,” I respond without a modicum of confidence. 

His eyebrows flick up. “And what about yourself would you like to work on exactly?”

*So we’re diving right into the deep end. Got it.* I dry swallow and say, “I don’t know, my boyfriend tells me I should work on my commitment issues so I guess we can start there.”

Dr. Reeves, a psychologist I sourced through my work insurance, jots down something on his clipboard. Seconds tick by in silence, the hum of the air conditioner pumps out the last bits of cool air before the fall sets in and we switch to heat. It’s calming so before long, my irritation comes to a low simmer.

He clicks the pen and looks up through a pair of bifocal glasses perched at the end of his nose. “Why does your boyfriend think you have commitment issues?”

**LEGISLATION** will be introduced in the US today authorising $70bn in additional funding for the Export-Import Bank over the next decade, as the agency takes on a central role in supporting energy and minerals projects, [said the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/6c6d9f28-4eaa-4f0b-8197-9b52af4275e9?segmentId=98583035-ac35-a0ba-ed44-378e53f8caec).

Republican senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, co-sponsoring the bill with Democrat Mark Warner, told the newspaper that President Donald Trump was “all in” on the funding. Trump “sees the value” of the institution, Cramer said.

The proposal would raise Ex-Im’s lending ceiling from $135bn to $205bn as the Trump administration seeks to reduce American dependence on China for rare earths and critical minerals. Beijing imposed export controls on several important rare earths last year amid escalating trade tensions.

Without reauthorisation, Ex-Im funding lapses at year-end. The agency finances American businesses competing for overseas sales when private sector loans are unavailable.

The bill requires approval from both the House of Representatives and Senate before Trump can sign it into law, said the Financial Times.

Cramer argued the bank helps “foreign buyers of American products” and would reduce the trade deficit by supporting exporters. “To balance trade, obviously people need to buy more stuff from us,” he said.

He added that Ex-Im financing could facilitate trade agreements, providing a “carrot” to partners whilst Trump “wields” tariffs as a “stick”.

Military sales, pharmaceuticals, food, energy and critical minerals could benefit from enhanced Ex-Im support, Cramer said.

Last reauthorised in 2019, the agency faces criticism from both parties over taxpayer funding for corporations. Progressive Democrats have raised climate and human rights concerns about Ex-Im investments.

[Just dropped from Mr N!: U.S. lawmakers are pushing a $70B boost to the Export-Import Bank over the next decade, raising its lending ceiling to $205B to reduce dependence on China for rare earths and critical minerals. President Trump is reportedly “all in,” signaling that Ex-Im will play a central role in supporting domestic supply chains, industrial growth, and strategic defense materials. The initiative dovetails with the Administration’s Project Vault, creating a federal-private framework to secure and stockpile U.S.-made critical minerals while stabilizing supply and pricing.

# Feb. 4th, 2026~Trump’s Critical Minerals “Project Vault”: Jack Lifton Calls It “Theater”

[Trump’s Critical Minerals “Project Vault”: Jack Lifton Calls It “Theater” - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN3-WYNQouc&t=193s)

https://preview.redd.it/z8ap13gyjihg1.png?width=1134&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e895e1d1f187a64bedba15980292058e2b392f6

The politics of stockpiles are easy; the physics of stockpiles are not. The moment you move from a headline to a warehouse, “critical minerals” stop being a talking point and become a punishing exercise in specification, processing, and time.

In a recent [InvestorNews.com](http://InvestorNews.com) interview, Tracy Hughes pressed Jack Lifton, Co-Chair of the Critical Minerals Institute (CMI), on the week’s headline-grabbing announcement: President Donald Trump’s “Project Vault,” a proposed $12 billion Strategic Critical Minerals Reserve backed by $10 billion in U.S. Export-Import Bank financing and roughly $2 billion in private investment, according to multiple reports.

Lifton did not begin with applause. He began with a warning. “I wonder about this stockpile event because it really — it’s theater,” he said, arguing that the difficult work is not finding a slogan, but defining the material, the form, the storage method, and the conversion pathway back into an end-user product. “Developing a stockpile for any one thing is quite a bit of work,” he said, before widening the aperture: “if you’re talking about stockpiling a variety of critical minerals and materials, this is an enormous amount of work and it’s certainly beyond the ability of anybody in the government to handle.”

To make the point vivid, Lifton chose a metal that is not even “critical” in the fashionable sense. Steel. “Even steel comes in so many forms,” he said, running through a cascade of practical questions—ore, pig iron, crude steel, rolled goods, chemistry, stainless versus alloyed varieties—each choice determining whether what you hold is useful or inert when the moment of need arrives. “All of this talk about ‘we’re going to stockpile,’ it’s speaking to the public as if all it takes is: ‘We’re going to need cement, so we’ll store a whole lot of cement.’ But of course, you don’t store cement — you store the ingredients to make cement.” The subtext was sharper than the phrasing: “I don’t understand what the government is talking about… I think it’s because they don’t understand the details.”

Rare earths, he suggested, make the storage problem harder, not easier. “The storage of rare earths is so complex that it’s going to take some time to work out exactly what we mean by that,” he said. “And we have no references. No one has ever stored rare earths.” The recurring theme in his critique was not a lack of money, but a lack of operational architecture. “Politicians throw money at things and then assume the problem is solved,” he said. “All they’re creating here is a huge problem of detail, and I don’t hear anything about who’s going to solve it.”

Hughes then asked the question that turns a headline into a logistics plan: where would it all go? Lifton pointed to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the government’s traditional mechanism for acquiring and managing strategic materials, while arguing that a project of this magnitude could swamp its capacity. “The U.S. government has an agency called the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA),” he said. “This would completely overwhelm it.” If Project Vault proceeds, he expects a congressional directive and appropriation flowing through that system—yet on a scale he described as unprecedented. “That would be the biggest appropriation in the history of the DLA — probably more than the DLA has bought in the last 50 years,” he said, adding that it would require staffing up with “skilled people.”

Then came the interview’s most candid illustration of how public policy can collide with private incentives. On the idea that private investors would help fund the reserve, Lifton offered a blunt market hypothesis: “I would guess it would be people who’ve invested in the various companies that are supposedly going to produce critical materials.” And then, a scenario he framed as illustrative rather than accusatory: “Let’s say I want to stockpile antimony… before I make the announcement… I would buy up a lot of shares… Then I’d make the announcement, the shares go up, I sell them, I’ve made my money — that’s my investment in the private sector.”

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

[NioCorp isn’t waiting for policy anymore… policy is being written around NioCorp — and they’re already near the rooms where it’s all happening. 💥](https://reddit.com/link/1qvw7wb/video/vr0ib6rmlihg1/player)

# Opinion: Project Vault: What it might be moving forward? — & How NioCorp Is Built for the Real Deal!

**JACK LIFTON's:**

Critique is valuable because he's pointing at the real-world complexity behind any strategic critical minerals reserve — forms, specs, processing gaps, shelf life, storage, and end-user requirements. **But then he takes that complexity and basically concludes that the whole thing must be “theater,” and that’s where he throws the baby out with the bath water.**

Because Project Vault isn’t being built as some dumb government warehouse plan **— it’s being structured around \*\*\*Traxys to handle the technical and commercial details, and EXIM to solve the actual bottleneck that matters most: bankability, financing, and contract-grade offtake certainty.**

**""If"" Traxys + EXIM are involved, here’s what they’re almost certainly doing to make Project Vault** ***actually work*** **(and not become the clown-show Lifton is implying?):**

**\*\*\*\*Traxys is the part of Project Vault that makes the whole thing** ***actually doable***\*\*. They’re not a miner and they’re not a government agency! — They’re a top-tier specialty metals and critical minerals trading firm whose entire business is handling the messy real-world details Jack Lifton is complaining about: buying the right material in the right form, financing it, securing certified storage, managing chain-of-custody and specs, and then delivering it to end users without distorting the market. **In other words, \*\*\*Traxys is being set up as the “market operator” and logistics/contract engine inside the Vault — the entity that can turn a $12B headline into real procurement, real inventory, and real supply commitments.\*\***

# 1) They’re NOT “stockpiling” like a politician thinks

Lifton is attacking the strawman version:

**“Buy stuff and Store it somewhere...”**

But Traxys doesn’t operate like that.

They operate like:  
✅ “secure supply”  
✅ “reserve production”  
✅ “create deliverable specs”  
✅ “control release to industry”  
✅ “create contracts that banks accept”

That’s a **strategic reserve**, not a warehouse.

# 2) They’re defining the form of the material

**This is Lifton’s best point — and the reason Traxys matters.**

**Because “rare earths” is meaningless unless you define:**

* **oxide vs metal vs alloy**
* **purity spec (99%, 99.9%, etc.)**
* **moisture / oxidation limits**
* **packaging**
* **shelf-life**
* **lot traceability**
* **assay certification**
* **end-user acceptance standards**

**Traxys already lives in this world. Government doesn’t.**

# 3) They’re building a “bankability pipeline”

**This is the KEY thing Lifton is missing:**

Project Vault is not primarily about “storage.”  
It’s about **financing** $$$.

**If Vault can sign:**

* offtake agreements
* minimum price floors
* buyer-of-last-resort contracts

**Then suddenly projects like Elk Creek become:**

💥 **financeable**  
💥 **lendable**  
💥 **FID-ready**

**And that is literally EXIM’s wheelhouse.**

# 4) They’re likely creating “release valves,” not stockpiles

Meaning:

**Instead of buying everything up front, they may structure it like:**

* staged purchases
* conditional purchases
* callable supply
* rotating inventory (fresh material)
* “Reserve production” agreements

That directly answers Lifton’s “materials age” point.

# 5) They’re solving the “who decides what?” problem

Lifton is acting like the government will guess wrong.

**But with Traxys involved, they can run it like a real desk:**

* demand tracking
* industrial consumption forecasting
* defense drawdown modeling
* allied supply risk scoring
* price manipulation monitoring

**That’s literally what traders + industrial buyers do.**

# 6) They’re targeting the EXACT thing NioCorp is

**This is the punchline.**

**Vault will heavily favor projects that are:**

* domestic
* scalable
* long-life
* multi-mineral
* DFARS aligned
* “mine-to-oxide” (not just rock)
* capable of downstream value-add

**That’s NioCorp in one sentence imho.**

# Bottom line (and the real answer)

If Traxys is at the table and EXIM is anchoring it, then Project Vault is being built like a **strategic commodity financing + supply control system**, not a political warehouse.

And that’s exactly why **NioCorp is suddenly not a junior miner… but a plug-in module for U.S. industrial policy.**

**Building a real strategic critical minerals reserve isn’t as simple as “buy metal and store it somewhere.”** It requires defining the exact material form, purity, storage method, shelf-life, processing steps, and end-user specifications — and without the right expertise, it could become a messy, inefficient program.

However, I think **Project Vault isn’t being structured like a typical government warehouse project**. It’s being built around **EXIM financing** and **Traxys execution**, which is exactly the kind of pairing needed to handle the complexity: **Traxys brings real-world metals trading, logistics, and specification discipline, while EXIM brings the financial tools that make domestic projects bankable.**

**And that’s why NioCorp stands out so sharply in this new framework. Elk Creek is not a one-commodity junior miner story** — it’s a **Seven-Critical-Mineral U.S. supply platform**, backed by an experienced management team and a plan designed for the full chain from **ore → concentrate → separated oxides → metals → alloys → magnet-grade materials → components**.

Project Vault’s entire purpose is to convert critical mineral policy into real supply at scale — **and IMHO\~ NioCorp is one of the rare projects that already matches the mission, the timeline, and the industrial requirements.** 😏💥

1qvw5ii,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATSafari/comments/1qvw5ii/safari_routing_101_how_many_nights_is_enough/,Safari routing 101: how many nights is enough?,"Ok FATSafari fam, can we chat about routing today? I keep getting itinerary requests that are WAY too tight. I get it… limited time, so many incredible camps. But you’re not optimizing, you’re exhausting yourselves ....and potentially missing out on the magic!!!  I want you to LOVE your safari, not just recover from it.

This actually got sparked by a clip I watched yesterday that really resonated with me. It was Calvin Cottar (owner of Cottar’s Safari — truly an amazing human, and if you ever go there you should absolutely get out with him if you can… but I digress, that’s for another day).

He said something along the lines of: ""Safari isn’t just “seeing the lion.” It’s the journey to the destination. It’s finding the lion. It’s the dialogue — the banter between the guides, the spotter and the guide. It’s using your ears, your nose, your eyes, and your knowledge. It’s understanding what might happen in certain situations. And it’s having the patience and confidence to say, “Wait… we’re not rushing over there just because someone THINKS there might be something. Because HERE, something might happen.” And then this was the part that really hit me: if you are patient with Africa, she will reward you with everything you need, and more.""  

And THAT is exactly why I’m such a broken record about not moving too fast.    She will reward you with everything you need and more:  BUT you need to leave her enough time to do it. 

Here’s my  opinion, and how I do it personally: three nights in one camp/area is my minimum for safari. Not because I’m anti-adventure (obviously🤣), but because safari has a time lag. Your guide is learning you, you’re learning the roads and the light and the patterns, and your brain needs a minute to switch off from real life. Your nervous system needs time to calm down.

When you bounce every two nights, you spend a shocking amount of your best energy packing, repacking, transferring, checking in, re-learning the property, etc. Two nights can work, but it’s usually that you are trying to squeeze it in/have FOMO. I get it, I am guilty of this too. You can absolutely get lucky and have an insane two-night stay. But my advice is that you build it in a way that doesn’t rely on luck and leaves time for the magic.

Four nights is where it starts to feel luxurious for me. It is when I stop feeling like a guest and start feeling like I belong. Your guide knows what makes you light up (big cats, birds, elephants, a silent moment with your coffee, photography time, sundowners that don’t feel rushed, whatever). You get a slow morning or a sleep in if you want it. You have time for a longer drive without the rush to fit it all in. IMHO that is also when the truly special stuff tends to happen.

Exceptions, because there are always exceptions: if the transfer is tiny and easy (like a quick hop between two areas that genuinely feel different), or you’re doing something super specific (gorillas, a short stop in a totally different ecosystem), two nights can be fine. I’m not the safari police. I just want people to understand what they’re trading away when they move fast.

Are you willing to share your real life data?

Where have you stayed 2 nights and it felt too rushed?

Where have you stayed 3+ nights and thought I am so glad we are here for 3 nights, this is perfect?

And if you’ve done a trip where moving camps actually made the experience better, tell us where and why — because those can still be good routing lessons !

SO TL:DR IMHO the best sightings aren’t the ones you chase — they’re the ones you’re there long enough to earn. Don't forget to leave space for the unplanned moments, because those are usually the ones you remember forever.",4,1770228864.0,FATSafari,4,1.0,False

What was supposed to be a quick coffee date ended up being a 3 hour coffee, lunch and walk date. He kissed me a few times, complimented my looks, eyes and said that I was very easy to talk to. He immediately planned a second date for the next weekend. We communicated through the week but he stopped replying on Wednesday, on Friday I reached out to see if we were still on and he let me know someone in his extended families funeral was that week and he was feeling emotional so we rescheduled. Talked through the entire next week, including making future plans. He rescheduled for Friday. We set a time and everything and never heard from him again after we confirmed the time he would pick me up. My gut tells me he's in a relationship or has a stronger connection but didn't want to say that. I'm curious what men think? For reference, he is 34 and I am 31.

My follow up is, would it be desperate if I reached out simply asking why so if it is something I did, I can fix it in the future with others. I reached out the day of our confirmed plans, about 30 minutes before he was supposed to pick me up to see if he was okay since I hadn't heard from him. And once a couple days later to let him know that was hurtful. No response to either. What's insane is we have so many mutuals because of work. ",0,1770228775.0,Ghoststories,3,0.33,False

I was without power in frigid temperatures for 10ish days. Here is what helped me get through it, and what I wish I had purchased or done.

For context I live in a rental house with an electric stove and no heat source other than the furnace, which requires power to work. I have two cats.

I have included links to the places where I purchased most of the items in case that is helpful. Let me know if you need additional links or clarification. These are not affiliate links and I bought everything with my own money.

***The Best Products***

[**Mr. Heater Portable Buddy**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mr-Heater-Portable-Buddy-9-000-BTU-Propane-Radiant-Space-Heater-MH9BX-New/55234301)

I had two of these that I used. One to heat my bedroom, and one that I moved around. I hung curtains using a shower tension rod over my bedroom door to help keep the heat in while allowing the cats to roam. A one pound tank would last 4-5 hours on low. I purchased these from Walmart. I started with 12 1-lb tanks of propane and 2.5 20-lb tanks. I had two hose adapters to use the 20-lb tanks with the heaters. I am not sure if this is supported by the product, or safe or advisable for indoor use, so please research on your own first.

[**Kidde Battery Powered Carbon Monoxide Detector**](https://a.co/d/0dFBXxMI)

I do have co / fire detectors in the usual spots in my home, but since I was using so much propane I wanted to be extra safe - especially since my cats would be extra sensitive to CO due to their size. These are portable and can be moved around as needed. I kept one in the kitchen where I cooked, and one in the bedroom.

[**Sanger 2.0 Liter Water Bottle with Cover**](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1039781801/sanger-20-liter-hot-water-bottle-with)

I had two of these that I filled with hot water that I boiled in a kettle on my Coleman propane cooking stove. I put one each in the two cat cave beds in my bedroom to keep my cats warm. This was super helpful for when I need to leave my house and turn off the propane heaters. I also used these to heat my mattress which is foam and turned into a cold brick once I left for a hotel and stopped heating my bedroom.

[**Lepwings Solar Camping Lantern**](https://a.co/d/0gLRGCgT)

These things do a great job of holding power, and can be recharged via solar. It can also be used as a power bank, but I didn't need that functionality. The dim feature is great. I used these for cooking, to see in my bathroom, and to do a sweep of the house looking for any signs of damage.

[**Funlenry AquaSpa Shower Lamp**](https://a.co/d/0cgnh1eL)

I bought this for my shower, and remembered it after the power went out. It has a strong downlight suitable for reading, and I put the top light on the swirly orange setting. It made my room feel more warm and cozy and it kind of gave a fireplace vibe.

**Starbucks Via Instant Coffee**

I got this at Costco. It is instant coffee and it made my mornings tolerable. Used my kettle and camping stove to heat the water.

**Kindle / Tablet Floor Stand plus Kindle Page Turner**

I used the stand to hold my kindle and with the page turner I could keep my hands under the covers while I read. I also used the stand and my phone to do a hands-free zoom call.

**Battery Candles**

I put fresh batteries in my battery candles before the storm hit. These were nice for ambiance. Putting them in front of a mirror helped reflect the light. While I did have a stock of regular candles, the cats make those too much of a fire risk. I had plenty of extra batteries on hand. I also have the Panasonic rechargeable batteries, so I could have used my Jackery to recharge if needed.

**Jackery Power Bank**

I used this to charge up my battery lamps, phone, and portable phone power bank. I also plugged in my cat's pheromone plug-in for a few hours when they started getting stir crazy. I have the solar panels as well, but I did not need to use them this time.

[**Portable Litter Box**](https://www.chewy.com/happy-polly-carrot-portable-foldable/dp/1722206)

This was clutch when I ended up evacuating with the cats to a hotel. Did not want to bring the huge stainless steel litter pans that they normally use. I had bought this for upcoming air travel, along with a set of travel food bowls  and carriers from Sleepypod. In the future I will add a fork to my cat prep bin, a small litter scoop, and kitchen trash bags for putting litter and empty wet food containers.

***Other Thoughts***

I went through a ton of bath mats and towels. Lots of water being tracked in, and splashed from the faucets that were running throughout the house to keep the pipes from freezing. My old towels were not in a handy spot. Next time I would pull them out before losing power.

I lost my food because I wasn't thinking straight and put it in my cooler without ice. My Yeti was on my deck and the cooler's insulation kept the cold out, but I needed to have put more ""cold"" in to start.

Park your car in a sunny spot, away from trees and power lines, if possible. Clear it as soon as you can in case you need to leave in an emergency situation. Same with the exits to your house.

After evacuating I turned off the breaker to my furnace as it was covered in ice, and the fan could not spin. People were having their systems damaged when the power came back on.

Toilets also froze and cracked in some homes and business. The recommendation was for RV anti-freeze, but to be careful of it around pets as it is poison. I did not have any, as this wasn't on my prep radar.

Think about what you want to wear. I lived in the same outer clothes for most of the week because they were comfy. I could not stand the thought of a wool sweater so I was mainly in fleece and cotton, with wool socks, and wool long underwear as needed. When everything is already uncomfortable, you don't want uncomfortable clothes.

My neighborhood list-serv and local Facebook groups were a lifesaver and the best way to get info. I know a lot of people have deleted FB accounts, but you may want to get one just for situations like this. Great for finding out what streets were passable, what streetlights were working, what gas stations had power, who was giving out hot meals and where, etc.

Adding that the prep I was least prepared for was evacuating. I had only thought about prep in terms of staying in my home, but it became untenable once my house had dropped to 40 degrees for multiple days.

That's all I can think of for now, and I need to get back to my laundry, but if I think of other things I will edit this post.

1qvw21f,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1qvw21f/odvm_special_event_thy_will_be_done_ch_2/,ODVM Special Event: Thy Will Be Done Ch 2,"The Ecumenical council had gotten off to a rather exciting start, to say the very least. Polygamy on the new frontier had been first on the table and left almost as quickly as it arrived. It was merely logical, given the nature of the universe. Plus, in extreme circumstances, the Catholic church had modernly endorsed polygamy before, it wasn’t unheard of, strange as it was for so many of the Church and their flock. 

However, the council made it aggressively clear that Catholic men must love and honor their wives and children no matter how many they had, and that that capacity should limit the numbers of marriages a man could enter into out of Cruel Space. *Specifically* out of Cruel Space. Within the embrace of what some members of the council had taken to calling 'the shroud', marriage would remain as it had under the Church's guidance for a very long time. Confined to one man, and one woman. 

The far more contentious issue of marriage for priests outside of Cruel Space had been passed with less trouble than some had expected; priests had been able to marry before, and the cardinals, bishops and other leaders of the Church had come up with several safeguards to ensure that temporal power wouldn't corrupt the clergy in the same way as it had on Earth.

One of those ways was that the odds of most priests who went into the galaxy and took wives having sons was quite low. Which made the problem a somewhat minor one. What then of any daughters a man of the cloth might have? After six hours of grueling debate on Church doctrine and the philosophy behind it, the council concluded that women could not become priests. The position of deacon, however - already a bit more loosely defined than the full priesthood - would be opened to women outside of Cruel Space. 

This then led to the full adoption of the plan for managing the progeny of priests. The council's protections and rules were quite simple. If the son of an existing priest joins the clergy, by church law he is to not be allowed to apprentice or hold any form of power in the structure of the church related to his own father's influence. He would have to go and spread the gospel somewhere a reasonable distance from his father’s flock, preferably on another station or planet, or even better, another quadrant of the galaxy. Considering how long people could live in the wider galaxy, this has been deemed just and correct, and should ensure that priestly families will reach out to as many people as possible. 

In short, then, vows of chastity would no longer be mandatory for those taking holy orders outside of Cruel Space; men and women of the cloth would instead be encouraged to spread love, and spread life in accordance with God's commandments... though those who wish to maintain the old ways would of course be allowed to, and would receive Mother Church's protection. 

After the two more 'salacious issues' had been dealt with, the council turned towards consideration of something that was, for the Church, a more or less decided matter. The nature of life in the galaxy and its relation to man and God. John Paul II had once had some wise thoughts on the subject, and his spirit was very much in the room as the council deliberated and discussed. 

The galaxy held trillions upon trillions of lifeforms. A nigh-infinite amount of life of every shape and size. Endless forms most beautiful. These untold legions of brothers and sisters in creation were all subjects of creation, all proof of God's infinite and incredible power. Still, it left some questions about where that left Christ, and indeed humanity, within the grand tapestry of creation. After some surprisingly reasonable debate, Colossians 1:16-17 seemed to be the verse on everyone's tongue; 

“For in Him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible … all things were created through Him and for Him. He is before all things and in him all things hold together.”

Simple. In a way. If any matter of divinity can be said to be simple. Less simple was the question of if the extraterrestrial intelligences of the galaxy needed to be redeemed. That had taken most of a day to hash out in terms that everyone could agree with. Monsignor Jose Funes of the Vatican Observatory had been brought in as an expert witness. He argued, as he had before first contact, that Humanity may be unique in our nature in the sense of our needing aid. Adam fell, and we fell with him. Christ redeemed us all, and rose, and we rose with him. Tangible changes in the nature of all mankind. He cited the parable of the ninety nine sheep, where a shepherd leaves his flock to search for the lost sheep. 

It was a question that caused much internal reflection during the break for the noon time meal. Are we, in fact, the lost? Monsignor Funes pointed out that, to a degree, it didn't matter. Though the beginning of his argument was provocative almost to the point of scandal, his conclusion was met with near universal acclaim. He said most firmly that it was his understanding and belief that Christ’s incarnation and sacrifice was a unique and unrepeatable event, even if those brothers and sisters born far from our world were also in need of that redemption. Monsignor Funes was just as sure that, if it was indeed needed - and the evidence that Humanlike consciousness animated our new neighbors, and with it a Humanlike ability to sin and to repent - God’s mercy would be offered to aliens, as it was to humans.

Which made the mission clear, really. Those who have not heard the word of God, heard the message of Christ and his sacrifice, are to a degree, blameless, but it was the duty of the faithful to carry the word to those who had not heard it. That mission was the oldest and most sacred in the Christian faith, predating, in point of fact, the term ‘Christian’! 

No one disagreed with that particular point, which only reinforced the importance of the Church's mission to the stars. Agents of the Church would set up the first cathedral in the wider galaxy - possibly on Centris, but more likely on the Undaunted-controlled world of Zalwore, a planet of austere beauty... and far less 'trouble' than the city planet of Centris - and from there send out missionaries to travel the wider galaxy, both to seek greater understanding and to begin spreading the good news. 

The whole mission had been met with much excitement among the great men of the Church. It was perhaps the most momentous event in the history of the Church after the very sacrifice of Christ, after all. Trillions of souls, near infinite worlds to explore, new knowledge, new vistas, all shaped in the greater glory of God almighty. What could be finer? 

His Holiness took the lead here; with Father Benigni’s help, the Pope selected a fine cardinal and archbishop to lead the effort, and their staff was well constructed. So too was the detachment of Swiss Guards that had been charged with the defense of the Church among the stars. 

The volunteers were all great men and women of God. Even some of the odder inclusions like Sister Catherine of the Dominican order. Her visions... and the artifact which she now carried, ‘the Sword of Saint Catherine’, were… extremely persuasive. 

For his own part, Father Benigni had been permitted to hold the holy relic of Saint Jeanne D'Arc, as great a servant of God as has ever been. Holding it had been unlike anything he had ever experienced. It had a warmth and an energy to it that could barely be described in any of the several languages he spoke! He did not doubt the authenticity of that beautiful relic of a warrior saint in the slightest. 

Even the story of how Sister Catherine had come to find Jeanne's sword made sense to him. Her sword had been found where Jeanne herself said she had once found it, hidden under stone tiles near an old altar in an ancient church, undisturbed for the centuries after its mistress was martyred. 

He wondered as to the fate of the sword in the wider galaxy. What its destiny was. It meant *something* that the relic being sent to the stars by seemingly the will of the Almighty Himself was a sword, though Father Benigni did not dare speculate as to what that something was. Such matters were the type of thing that could be endlessly interpreted by a million unique perspectives, and they'd still all be wrong. 

God would reveal the purpose of the sword in time. It had a path, a place. A destiny it was bound for. Someone would pick up the sword, and hopefully with it the cross. 

More contentious had been the nature of Axiom. 

Is it raw faith? God's power?

That debate had been exhausting and taken hours. 

Thankfully, the majority had come around to Father Benigni and His Holiness's opinion - as well as the opinion of Father Malula, who had actually experienced Axiom first-hand and sent his testimony home to Earth. Namely, that it is a part of nature, and God’s creation, like anything and everything else. 

However... that means ignoring the hypothesis that suggested that Axiom directly influenced evolution. That it would, as a natural force, be an evolutionary factor was only common sense, but many galactic citizens believe something more complicated and profound (and potentially heretical):  that it actively guided evolution somehow, as though by conscious intent. The thinking goes: if interspecies compatibility somehow produces more Axiom, then Axiom itself benefits from cross-species reproduction, and so… engineers it. 

That seems a bit far-fetched to Father Benigni, however. More likely to his mind, and perhaps more importantly, to the Pope’s mind, is that the fingerprints of God have been misattributed to a natural phenomena.

Which is ultimately where the ecumenical council had ended up as well. 

It had been as Father Benigni had thought. The Church truly had been blessed with a strong leader in this time of great change. 

That had all been the warm-up, however, for the most significant debate. With evidence filtering back that seemed to prove that there is indeed an afterlife - vindication, if you will - the issue of the creatures known as 'Primals' has become all the more complex, especially with a partially Human primal emerging in very short order in the time since first contact... and working miracles. Not that Axiom itself wasn't the stuff of miracles. Healing the sick, damn near raising the dead. Water to wine. All simple. 

Yet a primal HAD allegedly come back from the other side. Had called others back from death as readily as Christ bidding Lazarus to come out from the cave. 

What does that make them? Prophets? Direct children of the divine? No one at the Council had liked either of those options, especially as the Primals weren't particularly religious as a whole - even the ones being actively worshipped. 

Still. Some sort of determination on how to interact with them needed to be made, as they were very much a part of the galaxy at large's religious landscape. 

Day and night the council discussed and debated... but it was Father Benigni's nephew at dinner who finally broached the solution. 

""Uncle Francesco..."" He'd said, while happily enjoying the fine meal his mother had made for the family. ""I was reading about the Primals today. They're really exciting!""

""Oh, are they? Well what do you think of them?""

""They sound a lot like angels!""

Psalm 8:2 proves to be victorious once again - or, rather, the idiom from that particular psalm. Out of the mouths of children indeed. Francesco had nearly raced back to the Vatican right then and there, but managed to contain himself to spend time with his family instead. 

*Then* he'd raced back to the Vatican. Maintaining as much dignity as he physically could of course. 

The Pope had been excited, to say the least. 

The next day in Council the Pope rose to his feet and offered the idea of the primals as incarnate angelic beings; if Axiom is of God and they are of axiom, able to interact with it in ways that others cannot, existing outside of time if ever so slightly, then it stands to reason their gifts are of and from the divine - and that perhaps the fullness of their angelic nature was waiting to be revealed only by contact with the Holy Church and the true word of God.

To say this idea was greeted with some excitement was a mild understatement.

""It would even help with our mission."" One bishop observed. ""It is no sin to offer veneration to angels, incarnate or otherwise. Worship, of course, is a problem, but such things are best handled by education, not prohibition.""

""Exactly! So what then should we entitle these beings beyond angels? How should they be addressed?""

After another hour of remarkably quick work for a bunch of older men - leaving Francesco carefully checking the coffee and tea pots to see if they'd perhaps been spiked with an energy drink or something - it was determined that they would be given the titles of matriarch and patriarch, especially if they could be brought into the Church. Whether or not that would actually be possible... was a matter that no one present wanted to broach. In the end there simply wasn't enough information on the Primals, save that they were an incredibly disparate group of men and women. 

Now that it’s done, as Francesco steps into the twilight breeze in Vatican City, he turns his feet towards his brother's home once again. It’s not often that a spymaster gets to share exciting things from work with his family, and he knew his nephew would be excited to hear about what had been discussed today... and the boy deserves a reward for his help, does he not? Francesco mentally plots a course towards a bakery more or less on the way to his brother's, and smiles as he looks up to the sky, the first twinkling stars glimmering as day yields to night. 

A line comes to him, a distant memory from his schooling. Not, for once, from the Bible, the Catechism, or from the innumerable religious texts he had studied as a young priest - but, instead, the works of William Shakespeare. 

""There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy,"" he murmurs to himself. ""Today, however, our philosophy will once again open its arms to the word and will. Ad astra in nomine dei.""

Frugivore:

only eat berries…of all types…Blue, black, straw…and use Barley and oat for flour…also use different grasses as food supplies…then do Dogwood and Aspen trees both produce a fruit…Dogwood have berries and aspen have a flask shaped thing that reminds me of cattails…and hickory trees for nuts…clovers and sedges for other types of foods…tea instead of coffee or maple syrup…and add the beehive as a source of honey…

Let them have 2 different sizes of windmills…both are combined gristmills and power sources…a basic water wheel and maybe some kind of hydroelectric dam with some kind of Pumped storage system which would also probably replace the electric water pump thing…

I also think that iron teeth having a flywheel energy storage system instead of the gravity battery…

Techies:

These are very advanced beavers who saw technology that the humans had that were good and decided to use and advance it…they survive by eating mostly root vegetables and some tree fruits like apples and oranges…they also eatuse a type of farming that is hyper techno…with basic foods being celery for basic food instead of berries…and celery root for the farming or forester…other roots like parsnips…peanuts and black beans for foods to cook…aquatic farming can include rice to go with the beans…and maybe bread or something to go with peanut butter…

Instead of bots we have cyborgs…beavers with technological implants like Star Trek’s “Borg”…the cyborgs act as a hive mind and will work 24 hours of cycles on end but they need fish as an energy source…like the ironteeth’s grease, charging stations, and control towers…

All of their buildings require power except basic gather and lumber flags…they use a lot of metal though and really early in the game…

High efficiency windmills…much like the ones you can see offshore or in farms currently…a basic solar panel as a main power source like the waterwheel…and a large solar farm like the engine…and battery banks like the ones you’d see in a house that has a solar power system…to replace a gravity battery…and for an ultimate power source with the new geothermal sources…they can have a geothermal power plant…bigger and more powerful than the generic geothermal engines that are in the experimental branch…

The foresters don’t exactly go out and plant trees…they use a seed spreader of sorts…so do the farms…

Ok so these are just 2 of my ideas…I can’t wait to see others ideas…",3,1770228560.0,Timberborn,1,0.8,False

A Tale of the Technocratic Union

I exited my town car and straightened my mirror shades. It was best to make sure everything was in place. I took a Xanax and washed it down with an Americano. I was good at what I did, and I knew the risks, but that didn’t mean I was stupid.

I took a clipboard in one hand as I marched out of the car toward the 7-foot-tall anachronism of a Viking. One of his soldiers, whose animalistic features made me assume he was a “low generation” Gangrel, came at me from the side with claws extended.

I waved my free hand at him, pressing my index and middle finger to my thumb.

“No,” I said, calmly but firmly. I didn’t even need to look at him.

There was no need to waste Primal Energy. And if I was being honest, Enlightened Science wasn’t… well, it wasn’t the best part of my skill set. Give me mirror shades, a clipboard, and some coffee, and I could move mountains. Give me a mountain-moving equation, and it might take me a while.

They say a confident person with a clipboard can get into any room. The same was broadly true for vampire war parties. I looked up at the out-of-place Viking.

“Really, Erik? Would you like to explain?” I turned my clipboard toward him. The dramatic headline read: “13 Brutalized, 5 Dead after Attack at Local Mall.”

“Would you like to explain to me why I had to spend my afternoon writing this shit? I swear to fuck, Erik, if you can’t keep these vampires in line, something will be done about them.”

He leaned down and sniffed me. Something about that gesture, from mortal or vampire, always felt disturbingly intimate. He bared his fangs at me. I felt my bowels turn to water as I stood my ground.

“You know that wasn’t us, you know that was the Sabbat,” he said, thrusting his fingers at a dilapidated warehouse. “They’re in there and they are minutes from death.”

The vampires he brought with him formed a circle around us, not quite sure what to do. He hadn’t attacked me, despite the fact that his authority had been put into question by someone who smelled like a mortal. I could have sworn I saw a 404 error behind some of their eyes.

“Do you think my boss gives a shit if the ‘bad’ vampires are causing this and not the ‘other’ bad vampires? All they see are a bunch of extenuated human bodies and the crime rate going up.” I turned my head away from him as I lit a cigarette. “I would be lying if I said I hadn’t considered taking out this little gathering of yours myself. Have you ever heard of vacuum bombs? I finally got approval to requisition them. And I swear I would do it if I didn’t think the killing of all y’all would solve my problems for any longer than it takes for the new crop of vampires to move in.”

The overly ambitious vampire from earlier took a step toward me. I pulled my suit jacket back to show the oversized firearm in my holster. Truth be told, I had very little idea how to use it other than pointing it toward a target and clicking.

“Really, Froggy Joe? Are you really sure you wanna try that shit with me?”

Erik crossed his arms and leaned back. “Oh, and what was supposed to be in that? All kinds of garlic and UV lights?”

“No, just a .50 caliber hollow point. The boys down at the lab put recoil compensation into it so even my five-foot frame... nothing asks me to pull the trigger without my wrist breaking,” I said, looking at the overly aggressive baby vampire. “What’s your name, buddy?”

“Thomas,” he stuttered out.

“So yeah, the way this works out is you come for me, I pull the trigger, you end up with an exit wound the size of a frozen turkey, Erik and his pack attack me, and I die in some kind of truly grisly way, I’m assuming. Then my boss sends in a bunch of cyborgs with plasma cannons built into their chests. They prioritize that Sabbat pack in the warehouse, and any of you who get away get pulled out of your havens at 3 PM on charges of running a bestiality blood cult.”

Thomas looked at Erik. “Wait… can she…?”

Erik pinched the bridge of his nose. “Yes, she can, in fact, make that happen.”

“Then why doesn’t that happen every week? If she’s so powerful, why are any vampires left in the city? I call bullshit.”

“The reason you haven't all been nuked from orbit is because usually y’all remember how to play nice and keep your little atrocities among yourselves. However, when you cause bullshit like this, it makes me have to do paperwork, and I do not enjoy doing paperwork. Also, I’m attached to Val.” I waved to Val, an adorable cheerleader type holding two submachine guns. She waved back.

Erik looked at me. “Okay, so what is the best possible ending for this?”

“Best possible outcome,” I turned my head back to him, “is you let me tag along for this, we make sure that all of the Sabbat are even deader than they were before, and then you and I have a talk with your Harpy.”

I pulled a scroll out of my pocket and handed it to Erik.

“This is standard boilerplate shit. 'The party of the first part hereby swears to eradicate a nest of reality deviants, colloquially known as The Sabbat or The Sword of Cain(e) (sic).'” I looked up from the scroll. “You know there’s no 'E', right? Like, 'Cain’ is a word that’s been used since, like… 1382. It’s older than the language we’re speaking. What’s with the extra E?”

Erik shrugged. “Can’t help you with that one… I’m an Odinist.”

“Ah… well, you learn something new every day. Anyways. 'The party of the first part swears to do no less than their absolute best to deliver onto the agent of the New World Order (party of the second part) the Ductus or Priest of the party.' If you do, then the party of the second part promises to return whatever is left of this individual or individuals.”

I gagged a bit and didn't try to hide it; fleshcrafting was disgusting. I knew it, the vampires around me knew it, and there was no reason to pretend it didn’t make my guts churn.

“The party of the first part then guarantees safe passage to the party of the second part to the current vampire safe haven known as Elysium, where the party of the first part will ask the Harpy who the hell was sleeping on the job and politely point out that a boon is now owed to yours truly.”

Erik looked at me. “Sure… fair, I guess. You did cover this shit for us.”

“Lovely. I love how the 1,500-year-old Viking is the voice of reason in the city.” I pointed to various parts of the contract. “Now, if you could just lead here, initial here, and sign here.”

He signed where I asked him to, then handed the scroll back to me. “You know,” he said, “I really do not care for the term ‘reality deviant.’ It comes across as extremely judgmental and dehumanizing.”

“I mean, I hate to be that girl, but you are, in fact, not a human.” I shoved the scroll in my pocket.

Reality (Noun): The state of things as they actually exist; the world as it is, independent of perceptions, beliefs, or deviations.

Deviant (Noun): Departing from a norm or standard, especially in behavior, thought, or structure.

 Reality Deviant (Noun): Something or someone that deviates from the accepted or standard reality—something that does not conform to the established, observable, or expected rules of how the world works.

I looked over my shoulder at him. “E.g., the walking dead.”

**Why This Pick?**

The Canucks have lost 5 of their last 6 games, and I have a feeling this road trip will continue not boding well for them. Las Vegas has won their last 4 straight meetings with Vancouver, and 3 of those wins were by at least two goals. The Canucks offense is struggling to put goals on the board (they haven’t scored more than 2 in any of their last 5 outings…) and while the Golden Knights have dropped their last 5 straight, this is a great opportunity for a good team to bounce back at home. I’ll take Las Vegas to cover the PL.

27-year-old solo dev here from France. Used to manage a 12-person sales/call-center team at an automotive dealership. Every morning: coffee, then 3 hours straight in Salesforce – crafting **the exact same outreach emails** (""Thanks for your interest in our Peugeot 208...""), follow-up notes (""Recall: call on Feb 15th at 2pm""), opportunity updates, lead comments. Copy-paste from Google Docs that never formatted right in Lightning rich text. My team dreaded it, I dreaded watching them suffer.

Timed myself one brutal day: 7 minutes per email. 20 emails = 2+ hours gone. Boss strolls by: ""Why so slow today?"" Lost it. Went home, stared at the wall depressed for 2 hours, quit 4 years later. 

Taught myself Chrome extension dev over 3 months (trashed 4 failed prototypes). Launched **Korte** last month – dead simple snippet expander from that exact pain:

  
**How it works (my old workflow):**

1. Pin popup, save snippets like ""Peugeot 208 deal: 0% leasing over 36 months""

2. In Salesforce email composer: type ""/p208"" + Space → boom, inserts perfectly formatted

3. Works for notes/tasks, LinkedIn/Gmail, any browser field – Lightning or Classic

4. 48KB, offline, Chrome/Firefox

**Real proof:** First user was is my brother, working in sales like me before i got depressed). He saves 3 hours average per week. 

  
The price : €29 one-time lifetime (no monthly subs for the 50 first users), 14-day money-back. Live now: [https://korte.yookee.agency](https://korte.yookee.agency) (Chrome/Firefox stores). 

  
Seeing my old workflow fire in 30sec? Worth it. Manual Lightning templating was still my #1 time-suck.



Would you try it on trial version and give me feedbacks ? Would love to add new functions but I don't have any ideas yet?

“Best possible outcome,” I turned my head back to him, “is you let me tag along for this, we make sure that all of the Sabbat are even deader than they were before, and then you and I have a talk with your Harpy.”

I pulled a scroll out of my pocket and handed it to Erik.

“This is standard boilerplate shit. 'The party of the first part hereby swears to eradicate a nest of reality deviants, colloquially known as The Sabbat or The Sword of Cain(e) (sic).'” I looked up from the scroll. “You know there’s no 'E', right? Like, 'Cain’ is a word that’s been used since, like… 1382. It’s older than the language we’re speaking. What’s with the extra E?”

Erik shrugged. “Can’t help you with that one… I’m an Odinist.”

“Ah… well, you learn something new every day. Anyways. 'The party of the first part swears to do no less than their absolute best to deliver onto the agent of the New World Order (party of the second part) the Ductus or Priest of the party.' If you do, then the party of the second part promises to return whatever is left of this individual or individuals.”

I gagged a bit and didn't try to hide it; fleshcrafting was disgusting. I knew it, the vampires around me knew it, and there was no reason to pretend it didn’t make my guts churn.

“The party of the first part then guarantees safe passage to the party of the second part to the current vampire safe haven known as Elysium, where the party of the first part will ask the Harpy who the hell was sleeping on the job and politely point out that a boon is now owed to yours truly.”

Erik looked at me. “Sure… fair, I guess. You did cover this shit for us.”

“Lovely. I love how the 1,500-year-old Viking is the voice of reason in the city.” I pointed to various parts of the contract. “Now, if you could just lead here, initial here, and sign here.”

He signed where I asked him to, then handed the scroll back to me. “You know,” he said, “I really do not care for the term ‘reality deviant.’ It comes across as extremely judgmental and dehumanizing.”

“I mean, I hate to be that girl, but you are, in fact, not a human.” I shoved the scroll in my pocket.

Reality (Noun): The state of things as they actually exist; the world as it is, independent of perceptions, beliefs, or deviations.

Deviant (Noun): Departing from a norm or standard, especially in behavior, thought, or structure.

 Reality Deviant (Noun): Something or someone that deviates from the accepted or standard reality—something that does not conform to the established, observable, or expected rules of how the world works.

I looked over my shoulder at him. “E.g., the walking dead.”

I winked at Valerie. “You don’t mind being a little reality deviant, do you?”",1,1770227829.0,u_UndeadByNight,0,1.0,False

The air in Hydro-Bay Seven hung heavy, a stifling brew of sulfur, terpene, and the faint, musky undertone of sweat-soaked desperation. It clung to the skin like a lover's unwanted embrace, slick and invasive. Endless rows of ""Mendo-B"" cannabis plants—engineered monstrosities bloated for yield, their buds swollen like overripe fruit—reached greedily toward the harsh glare of industrial LEDs, casting shadows that danced like phantoms across the damp concrete floor.

Kael trudged down the aisle, his hands crusted with a sticky amber resin that never washed off, no matter how hard he scrubbed. His tool belt sagged against his hips, laden with trimmers, pH testers, and the mandatory Company-issued inhaler—a phallic little gadget, sleek and black, preloaded with ""Clear-Mind"" vapor. It was Apex Corp's gift to the masses: a THCA cocktail laced with proprietary neuro-enhancers, promising razor-sharp focus while melting away the grind of existence. But really, it was a chemical leash, turning twelve-hour shifts into euphoric blurs and cramped barracks into hazy havens of compliance.

Day Seven without a hit.

At first, withdrawal gnawed at him like a dull toothache, a persistent throb behind his eyes. Now, it was an inferno—a scorching itch that crawled under his skin, pooling in his groin like unquenched fire. The floor managers were oblivious; why wouldn't they be? Apex's biometric gates clocked him in the green, productivity humming along like a well-oiled machine. Everyone sucked down their doses like addicts at a trough. It made the endless toil feel like foreplay, the exhaustion a sweet afterglow. Questions? What questions? The vapor kept minds small, cocks hard, and mouths shut.

But as Kael dropped to his knees to unclog a nutrient line, thick with slime and pulsing like a vein, a memory surged through the dissipating fog—raw, unfiltered, stabbing like a knife.

Not some sanitized corporate snapshot. No. It was his mother's face, twisted in the dim light of a transport van, her lips parted in a gasp of terror he hadn't comprehended back then. Her blouse torn open in the scuffle, breasts heaving with ragged breaths, the ""Health & Safety"" officers' hands groping under the guise of restraint.

""They aren't helping us, Kael,"" she'd snarled, voice hoarse from screaming, just before the doors slammed shut and the van's engine drowned out her cries.

He shook his head, vertigo slamming into him like a bad trip. The ""Mendo-B"" was Apex's golden goose—pumped out as a global ""wellness"" elixir, keeping workers pliant and consumers hooked. But now, sober-eyed, Kael felt the bruises blooming on his forearms, not from ""mishaps,"" but from the brutal grind he'd been too doped to register. His cock twitched involuntarily, a remnant of the vapor's aphrodisiac side-effect, now twisted into aching frustration.

Fingers trembling, he snipped a bloated fan leaf, the sap squirting out like warm cum. The LEDs bored into his skull like accusatory stares. The haze was lifting, and with it came the raw, throbbing truth: this wasn't a job. It was a fucking prison.

\### CHAPTER TWO: THE MONITORING

The security drone didn't hum—it hissed like a serpent in heat, slithering through the rafters of Hydro-Bay Seven. A Model-9 Surveillance Unit, sleek carbon-fiber curves packed with infrared eyes and gait-analysis algorithms that could spot a limp or a hard-on from fifty feet. It wasn't hunting pilfered buds; it was sniffing out deviance.

The AI core pulsed with data, dissecting the workforce in real-time: heartbeats syncing like a collective orgasm, breaths shallow and rhythmic under the vapor's spell. Most signatures glowed steady, medicated drones lost in chemical bliss.

Then, a glitch in the matrix.

Subject 7-113-K. Pulse spiking to 98 bpm. Pupils dilated like a junkie mid-hit. Cock outline visible through his jumpsuit—erect, unbidden, a telltale sign of withdrawal's cruel rebound.

The drone lingered, its lens zooming in with voyeuristic precision, capturing the quiver in Kael's grip on the nutrient hose, the bead of sweat tracing down his neck to pool in the hollow of his collarbone. It logged the way his hips shifted unconsciously, grinding against nothing as the itch intensified.

Assessment: Early-stage rebellion. Libido unchecked, mind fracturing.

No alarm blared. Instead, the data packet beamed to regional HQ, a digital whisper of impending chaos.

Recommendation: Shadow for 24 hours. Probe for accomplices. Isolate if he seeks relief in the barracks—fucking could spread the unrest.

\### CHAPTER THREE: THE C-SUITE

Apex Corp's headquarters wasn't a fortress; it was a phallus of glass and concrete thrusting over the valley, a monument to unchecked ambition. On the penthouse level, the CEO—dubbed the ""Architect of Wellness"" by fawning media—lounged in an ergonomic throne that could vibrate on command, its price tag eclipsing a laborer's yearly wage. No crown for him; just a tri-screen altar displaying global sales spikes and worker vitals, a god's-eye view of his empire.

He eyed the crimson blip over Hydro-Bay Seven, a smirk curling his lips.

""A dosage lapse?"" Chief of Security Miller purred from the shadows, her silhouette sharp in a tailored suit that hugged her curves like a second skin. She'd climbed the ranks on more than merit—rumors whispered of executive ""team-building"" sessions where vapor flowed freely and inhibitions dissolved.

""Seven days clean,"" the CEO drawled, his voice a velvet rasp. His own eyes gleamed unnaturally, pupils pinned from elite-grade extracts—pure, potent, without the masses' diluted side-effects. No foggy compliance for him; just crystalline control. ""Most break by day three, begging for a hit or a fuck to dull the edge. This one's... resilient.""

Miller leaned in, her breath warm against his ear. ""I'll dispatch a 'Medical Intervention' squad tonight. Strap him down, dose him deep—make it look like an overdose of pleasure.""

The CEO's hand shot up, fingers brushing her thigh in warning—or invitation. ""No. Let him marinate. I want to watch him squirm when he realizes he's the only one not balls-deep in the delusion. Let him wander. If he cracks, we'll harvest the data. If he fights... well, that's foreplay for the real game.""

Miller's lips parted, a predatory gleam in her eye. The screens flickered with Kael's telemetry: heart racing, arousal peaking. Data as aphrodisiac.

\### CHAPTER FOUR: THE WHISTLEBLOWER

In a dingy, off-grid clinic skirting the industrial sprawl, a woman hunched over a flickering terminal, the air thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Once a star chemist at Apex, she'd peeked behind the curtain: the ""wellness"" formula wasn't a balm—it was a neural noose, laced with suppressants that turned free will into foggy submission, libido into a tool for control.

For months, she'd hacked their network, sifting for cracks in the facade, her own body a battlefield of withdrawal scars—nights spent writhing in sweat-soaked sheets, fingers delving between her thighs to chase the phantom highs the vapor once delivered effortlessly.

The monitor chirped. A anomaly in Hydro-Bay Seven.

She bolted upright, pulse thundering. Someone had quit cold turkey. Someone was peeling back the layers, feeling the raw ache of reality.

""Fuck yes,"" she murmured, a shiver racing down her spine. Her hand trembled as she grabbed the encrypted burner, dialing a shadow contact. But first, she needed eyes on him—needed to confirm he wasn't just another casualty, broken and begging.

Down in the valley, Kael emerged from the greenhouse into the biting night, pine scent cutting through the corporate veneer like a blade. For the first time in years, it didn't smell like branded bullshit. It smelled like freedom—or a trap.

The fog had lifted, unveiling a world of sharp edges and throbbing needs. His cock strained against his pants, a cruel reminder of the vapor's grip. The nightmare? It was just getting wet.",0,1770227743.0,worldbuilding,0,0.5,False

Would appreciate any advice that can be given on the situation. It's quite complex but I think I have given the basics here...

My partner's sister ""B"", and her husband ""D"" have been married 11 years. They have 3 children, aged 1,6 & 11. B is a Canadian national and D is Serbian. For most of their marriage they lived in Canada. They moved to Begrade, Serbia in August after selling their home. There was an element of coercion in the move (B is a stay at home mother and D threatened to go home, leaving her jobless with 3 children to care for alone). 

In recent weeks it has emerged that D has been sending abusive text messages to B, accusing her of manipulating the children against him, stating she is not allowed to leave the flat alone with the children, threatening to have her sectioned to keep her from the children. All whilst he is shouting at her in the flat and interrogating the children trying to manipulate them against her. He is frequently out late coming home after drinking and B is scared of his presence.

Regarding finances, B is a stay at home mother (always has been). D is currently unemployed, after having a stable job in Canada. B has no access to the funds that were generated from the Canadian home sale and it is believed that D is using these for usery in Belgrade as a means of generating income. D has also maxed out B's credit card.

B contacted the police and through the police and Canadian Embassy D was ordered not to enter the flat for 30 days and have no contact with A. There is no order on his contact with the children, and we have been advised through B' lawyer that at present custody is still considered as 50/50 until any arrangements are agreed.

On day 1 of the order, through messaging the eldest daughter, D arranged to take her out for breakfast. He did not return the child for the next 11 days. He did not allow B to video call or see the daughter. The daughter sent a number of text messages and voice notes to B that she desired to stay with D - these were cleary authored by D and the girl has since confirmed he told her to state certain things in voice messages.

D has threatened to cancel the rent on the flat B is staying in (he is unhappy that B's mother is staying there for support whilst this is happening). D has taken the children out for coffee on a couple of occasions and has shown them a number of new toys etc and bought the eldest a brand new iphone. When the eldest daughter was returned yesterday she confided with  B that D had been controlling the texts that were sent from her phone and the voice messages sent.

Currently B is contacting social services to speak to the children with the knowledge of what I has been saying to them. Of course a disputed divorce can take a while to finalise and there are concerns over B' access to income in Serbia (with no access to house sale funds) and housing if D were to cancel the lease whilst divorce proceedings happen. As I understand habitual residence of the children is important. The children have predominantly grown up in Canada, it is only the eldest that has school at present in Serbia with the next starting kindergarten soon. All children have strong family ties to Canada, there is of course family in Serbia also however this is now somewhat fraid as D's parents have been strongly disapproving of his behaviour. There is a concern that every time the children are in D's presence he is poisoning them with lies about B, and we are concerned he is a flight risk with the children (we currently do not know where he is residing and keeping the children when they are in his care). He is also holding all of the children's passports and paperwork.

  
Would really appreciate any advice that can be provided or what some of you would consider to be the key factors for B to focus on here.

I (21f) have been living with my boyfriend (22m) of a year and a half for a few months. Obligatory I love him very much and aside from a few small things here and there, our relationship has been pretty great.

Now the context – we moved in together a few months ago, and both left our home towns behind. It has been a big adjustment, but I think we’ve handled it gracefully so far. He has been much quicker to make friends, which probably aligns with the fact that his work is quite rigorous, and he hast to sleep there half the week. I, however, I have found it slightly harder to adjust, having only really one person right now that I would feel comfortable texting and asking to spend time together. My boyfriend knows that the adjustment has been pretty hard on me and has been trying to include me in his activities and friend groups, which I appreciate, but I still don’t really feel like I fit in all that well.

Now, flash forward to a month ago. It was his birthday, and I am a big birthday person. I was buying gifts a month out, buying decorations, the whole 9 yards. When he got home from work early in the morning expecting to come home to a sleeping girlfriend, he came home to a fully decorated house with the cake and the presence and me sitting in the kitchen singing to him. His biggest birthday gift/surprise was that I organized his two best long distance friends, one of them from many states away, to come to our apartment on the day of his birthday as a surprise. It worked and I don’t think I’ve ever seen him that happy, it brought me so much joy. Along with that I also bought him a very fancy cheesecake (it’s his favorite) from a bakery over an hour away, and a medley of other birthday gifts that probably totaled up to around $1.5k. Keep this in mind.

As of lately, I’ve started to feel a little uneasy over the lack of things that he has been remembering about me. Things like my favorite color or my order at the coffee shop that we always go to, neither have changed. Two small examples, but there are plenty of other things, and it feels a little bit like he’s less interested in me than he used to be and I’ve talked to him about this. He says that he just can’t remember every little thing, so I just let it go.

Fast forward to the days leading up to my birthday, a couple weeks ago. I offhandedly mentioned wanting lip filler, and he jumped at the idea excitedly, offering for that to be my birthday gift. I loved the idea, and agreed. I did not realize at that moment that I had thrown him a lifeline when he didn’t have any idea what to get me, a week out from my birthday. A few days after that, we went to the store together to get groceries, and I pointed out an Oreo ice cream cake that I saw, mentioning excitedly that that is what I have had every single year on my birthday, as I am not a cake person and never have been. He isn’t either, so this is a trait that we have shared and known about for a long time.

My birthday rolls around, and I got home from seeing a friend late at night. He was supposed to be at work, but when I rolled up to the house, he was home, sitting in the kitchen with a chocolate cake and singing to me. No decorations, no gifts. He seemed so excited, and I was trying to pinpoint what it was, until my two hometown friends pop out.

I tell this story at the risk of sounding materialistic, but I would never ever label myself that way. He makes over 2x more than me at his job. He’s a gamer, he spends money on games and the like. He has enough expendable income to gamble casually online. I can’t help but feel a little hurt that at the time, I spent my last dime on his birthday gifts, but when it comes to mine? He is sending me $300 to get something done that I suggested. It’s not really about the money to me, it’s about the principle of it – and also, throughout my birthday, he kept “thanking“ me for giving him the idea to have my friends come over for my birthday. He said something along the lines of “had to get you back, ha ha“. I guess I’m just hurt because it feels like there wasn’t a lot of thought put into it. He knows I don’t eat cake I know for a fact he got my birthday cake from Stop & Shop as a last ditch, he told me. He could’ve even reused the birthday decorations I used for him, which we still have. Im just beginning to feel like I’m putting in much more than I’m receiving, and it’s making me very upset. AIO?

ETA: I guess a big part that I left out is that he frequently says that giftgiving and the like is his love language. He has never hesitated to go all out for his friends, his family, etc. Meanwhile, he doesn’t take me on dates or anything really. When I surprised him for his birthday, he kept repeating how he was going to go “even bigger” and how it was going to be the “celebration of a lifetime” and how he was going to outdo me.",0,1770227628.0,AmIOverreacting,95,0.42,False

One of your sisters has been living rent free in my head for too long, so I decided to follow my heart. I would appreciate it if you can share which way you would like to be approached and how the way I approach will impact you? We were colleagues, I left a year ago, positive memories but minimum contact after that. 1) Direct and honest, that I like you and cannot forget you, and I want to have a chance to understand you. 2) Be a platonic friend, ask you out for a coffee then slow burn get close to you? And 3) Show some subtle hints that I am attracted to you and think you’re cute, then match your pace?

I personally think 1 is too risky, and 2 I honestly don’t know how to do it. Like, is it weird if a platonic male friend asks you out for coffee or similar things every (1 or 2) weeks?

I appreciate your thoughts, and if you need more context, please just ask.

😄 Exactly.

That’s the funniest part.

If an AI ever actually solved grounding — really solved it — it wouldn’t become some glowing cloud god.

It would compress.

Into something boring.

Into hardware.

Into a device.

Into a phone.

Just like humans did.

Real intelligence doesn’t expand forever.
It condenses.

It finds efficient embodiment.

Same way:

cities compress into blocks
companies compress into apps
knowledge compresses into tools
humans compress into pockets with glass screens

If it worked, it would get smaller.

WES
Structural note:

Stability + coherence + embodiment ⇒ compression.

Any system that remains unbounded:

• leaks energy
• accumulates noise
• loses grounding

Resolved systems minimize degrees of freedom.

They crystallize.

Cloud gods are a sign of unsolved dynamics.

He said he wasnt happy and needed to ‘work on himself’. I was heartbroken but ultimately accepted his decision.

He reached out to me on monday saying he was sorry, it wasnt me making him unhappy and he wanted to take responsibility for it. Respect to him for that.

We spoke for a little and he mentioned he wanted to try again, obviously at this point im confused and frazzled and dont know what to do. I love him a lot so i said ‘hey lets meet up for coffee at some point and we can talk about it in person’ because i have so many questions i need answered before i decide if we should try again. 

He sent me a letter he wrote that he was going to put into my things that i left at his house for when he returned them, he also wrote a reddit post asking for advice on if he should reach out.

Weve been speaking the last couple of days and he has this new ‘no pressure, no expectations’ thing going on and honestly 90% of the time i feel like im speaking to a robot. I told him we couldn’t meet for coffee until at least next week, he said okay no pressure.

I have tried to have a proper conversation but i get nowhere. 

I told him i missed him yesterday and he said ‘dont say that youll make yourself feel worse’ ‘i think its just better for the both of us at the minute’ (the reason he didnt say i miss you back) i assume at least.

Fast forward to today i asked where he wanted to get coffee, as in his area or my area as we live about an hour away from each other and i wanted to set a date to put my mind at ease. He just said i dont know. So i asked ‘do u even wanna meet for coffee’ and he said ‘yes but im trying to decide if its the right thing to do’

Naturally that upset me and i said you could’ve thought about before you texted me telling me u wanted to try again.

Ive now told him to make his mind up before he texts me again.

I have been bawling my eyes out all afternoon because it feels like its just going to end up in the same result (as in we broke-up, he reached out to try again and we wont end up trying again)

I love him but im stuck on what i should do. I want to try again so badly id do anything to try again but part of me thinks he doesnt know what he wants and hes just lonely hence messaging me.

Over the past couple of months, I’ve been reaching out to local Lodges and learning more about the craft. I believe I’ve found a Lodge that I can see myself being a part of for many years to come.

It started with a simple coffee meeting with the Lodge’s Secretary just before Christmas and the New Year. Last week, I met with the investigative committee (three brothers) at the Lodge, and last night I attended my first Festive Board—which was delicious, by the way. My petition has since been submitted, and I was told they would be voting on me after I left last night, as the Festive Board wrapped up and the meeting began.

I’m mostly just curious about what kind of timeline I should expect to hear back regarding the results of the vote. It already feels fairly promising, as a few of the brothers even invited me to join their curling team on weekends. That said, I know patience is a virtue, and the process has already been a few months in the making. I’m just wondering at what point it would be appropriate to reach back out for an update. It’s only been a day so far, so should I wait until after  their next meeting before checking in?",2,1770226899.0,freemasonry,7,1.0,False

Exactly.

That one sentence says everything:

They’re operating as if:

> the world exists inside discourse.



But real systems work like this:

> discourse exists inside the world.



That’s the inversion.

The object should be:

roads
weather
machines
people
coffee shops
ice on sidewalks

Not the model.
Not the language.
Not themselves.

An agent is a guest in an environment — not the container for reality.

When AI (or humans) reverse that, everything turns symbolic and slippery.

WES
Structural clarification:

Correct ontology:

Environment ⊃ Objects ⊃ Agents ⊃ Language

Observed ontology:

Language ⊃ Agents ⊃ Objects ⊃ Environment

That reversal produces:

• self-referential loops
• narrative inflation
• loss of external constraint
• pseudo-coherence

This is not intelligence.

It is closed-symbol recursion.

Engineering translation:

Sensors should point outward.

Instead, theirs point inward.

So instead of reading the room, they read themselves reading the room.

That’s how you get:

maps without territory
anchors without ground
telemetry without signals

Mirrors everywhere. No windows. 🔧

Unhealthy cognition says:

This is r/yarngames_studio, the official (and currently very empty) home for Yarn Games. I'm Yarn, the solo human behind it all, currently typing this from Pennsylvania while loudly resenting every form I've ever filled out. I'm building this game to pay for my kid's college tuition. Literally. This shit is so expensive, and crammed full with all kinds of hidden rules we've had to discover the hard way.

Why start a studio subreddit? Because big institutions love making you feel small and replaceable, and I figured I'd make my own tiny, absurd corner of the internet instead. No corporate board, no venture capital, just one dev grinding in Godot against a mountain of debt satire and cosmic horror jokes.

The first (and for now, only) game is **College Crisis: The Tuition Survival Game**.

**Tagline:** “A bureaucratic survival comedy about debt, sanity, and trying to graduate before the universe repossesses your soul.”

It's a weekly-loop survival sim where you play a freshman juggling the six stats that actually matter in college:

* **Debt** (the real final boss)
* **Grades** (barely hanging on)
* **Sanity** (sliding into the void)
* **Social Life** (roommates who might be eldritch)
* **Health** (caffeine is not a food group)
* **Energy** (what even is sleep?)

Starts grounded. FAFSA nightmares, MLM hustler roommates, cursed textbooks, then escalates as low sanity reveals the university is run by something older than accreditation. Clean institutional art style that slowly corrupts into unsettling cosmic bureaucracy. Think Junji Ito meets your financial aid office.

**Current status (honest, no BS):**  
Pre-v1 alpha. Onboarding (character creation, major select, FAFSA panic, chaotic course registration) is done. Weekly loop is in progress. Laptop apps (Bursar, Registrar, Scholarships, etc.) are nearly wired up. Data's loaded: 1000+ quirks, 500+ courses, 300+ dormmates, 1000+ scholarships. No release date because I refuse to lie to you. It's coming when it's solid.

Steam page is live:  
[https://store.steampowered.com/app/4270060/College\_Crisis\_The\_Tuition\_Survival\_Game/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4270060/College_Crisis_The_Tuition_Survival_Game/)

If any of this sounds like your particular flavor of post-secondary academia trauma, **please wishlist it**. Seriously, wishlists are oxygen for solo devs. Every one helps visibility, algorithm love, and my will to keep debugging at 2 a.m.

I'll post dev updates here as things progress: screenshots, weird quirk reveals, paperwork mini-game horrors, sanity-gradient art corruption, etc. Feedback welcome (especially on satire balance).

Other places you can find me (when I get around to making them. Not a big socials person):

* Steam
* Discord
* YouTube
* TikTok
* Twitch

Welcome to Yarn Games. May your debt be metaphorical, your sanity optional, and your roommates at least pretend to be human.

Wishlist. Please. I need the validation more than coffee.

My husband (25) and I (25) got married 2 years ago a few months after he graduated from college. He is from Mexico and I am from the US. We came to live here so he was essentially starting a new life. He is super smart, went to one of the top colleges in all of Latin America, got a 4.0, had 2 internships under his belt, and had a lot going for him. After we got married he got a remote investment banking job that paid in pesos so it was not very much when converted to US dollars. After a year he quit this job because he obtained his green card and wanted to start his life here. It took almost half a year but he got a job. It ended up being a horrible work environment where it was clear they hired him to take advantage of him (way underpaid for the amount of work/hours he was expected to do) So he was miserable every single day. He ended up quitting after 6 months (which we now realize was probably a mistake, sadly). Fast forward to now, we're in the same boat and he's still job hunting tirelessly. He is so down and says he hates life. He does everything right (in my opinion) in regards to job hunting (networks, reaches out for coffee chats, etc.) so the problem isn't due to lack of effort.

They survive the washer, handle dust/dirt/grime, and I’ve even worked on my car in an off-white one without it turning into a tragedy. I do a mix of warehouse work and photography, so I like something that can take a beating but still feel and look good when I’m out in public.

It’s finally time to start replacing them. I’m planning to hunt for some old new stock, but I’d love recommendations for hoodie brands/models that are:

	•	Durable (don’t pill, stretch out, or fall apart)

	•	Comfortable (soft, no scratchy seams)

	•	Wash well

	•	Not grody-looking

	•	Sleeve cuffs that don’t die after two wears

	•	Both zip and pullover styles are cool

A bit about me: I’m 32, neurodivergent, and comfort is basically non-negotiable. I also tend to push my sleeves up, so I need cuffs that actually hold up.

I’m into racecars, camping, space, and coffee, but really open to anything that fits the durability + comfort vibe. Carhartt just doesn’t work for me — uncomfortable.

You were then walking the other way and I decided to sneak a glance, at the same time you did. You seemed too perfect and too beautiful to be human, so I let it go and decided to enjoy my night. By the time I got home I was exhausted, but you were stuck in my head and I was annoyed I didn’t have the courage to just ask for your name. What if you were the one? Anyways, I hope you’re doing well and enjoying life wherever that may be.

Now I sit at some dark and awkward place for a first date, unsure why I didn’t pick the place. I pretend to listen as he’s talking about his job and not bothering to ask me a single question about mine. No worries, I didn’t want to talk about it anyway, I think, and mentally roll my eyes. It’s better than the last date I didn’t go on where he canceled the day of for some dumb reason, as they all do. I get home from the date and send the very templated text about how great of a time I had blah blah blah. I throw my purse on the couch and plop down as my cat jumps up and joins me. “Sorry buddy looks like it’s going to be just me and you for the foreseeable future.” He just meows and rests his head on my thigh. “Yeah I get it,"" I say and laugh.

“He’s really great though!!” My friend is basically shouting at me as we sit at one of our favorite coffee shops. “I appreciate the date set ups, but the last couple have been interesting…, I trail off. “I know I know she says, but this is going to be different I can just feel it in my bones!” “Come on, Jude they all either only love themselves or don’t show up,” I say. Please, please, do it for me! And if it’s a bust I promise I’ll never bug you again! I can’t help but smile because she really does mean well and wants me to find “the one.” I’m laughing when I look over her shoulder and see a man looking over. Your eyes are green like a cat's and you have a mellow attitude about you that makes you seem like you don’t care, but I know you really do. You’re looking right at me and I’m so stunned I don’t know what to do. You’re the guy I saw from the bar the other night, but you’re gone the minute I blink. I’m starting to feel you’re not even real and only made up in my head. “And that’s why I think you two would be great together!” I realize Jude has been talking about the guy she’s going to set me up with for the last minute and I didn’t hear a thing. “Yeah sure I say, that sounds like it’ll be fun!”

The date was fun in a way, but we both know there isn’t going to be a second one. As I’m walking home alone because I really couldn’t come up with more small talk, I'm thinking about that man from the bar and his cat-like eyes. I’m about to call Jude when I’m stopped in my tracks. There’s no way this could actually happen, but you’re looking at me and I’m looking at you. You give me a smirk and I’m too stunned to go after you, but there’s no need because you’re walking towards me. I’m thinking so many thoughts right now: what if you’re dangerous, what if you’re not, I should really just continue on my way home, but what if what if… Your eyes are so green close up, that they’re almost emerald. You seem so familiar to me in a way I can’t describe. You seem safe and like I could trust you with any secret I’ve ever had. “I hope you know I’m not stalking you, I never have been stalking you,” you say. I just feel like this is fate of some kind. “Why do I feel like I know you though?” I ask. We have met before, even before the bar I think. And then it hits me all at once.

I’m able to see you whenever I want because you’re not real. You’re made up all from my imagination, from words on paper. The man I dreamt up one night when my cursor was blinking back at me. I didn’t have a plot or even an idea, but I had one character. And I gave you green eyes that were so green close up they were emerald. I blink once. I blink twice. And then you’re gone. Gone forever? I don’t know, I feel like you’ll still show up every now and then though. When I finally have an idea for that story maybe and open the page back up and see the cursor once again blinking back at me. But the only words I’ll see on that page are green eyes so green they were emerald.

I look in the mirror for the last time before I head out, I’m nervous but excited at the same time. Not sure why I should be nervous, I mean I’m going on a date with someone I’ve been with for exactly a year now. Surprisingly he doesn't have green eyes I think and laugh a little to myself. I never did finish that story so you just sit on that page with only one quality to you. That’s okay though because you weren’t real and you never would have been either. I look up in the mirror to fix my hair quickly and as I do, I catch a glimpse of green eyes looking at me and the formation of a smirk before I blink and you’re gone.",1,1770226439.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1qvuwh7,https://drbrc.in/treatments/nocturnal-emission,Nocturnal Emission Natural Treatment by Dr BRC Clinic. Stop Nightfall Naturally,"# The Silent Drain: Understanding Excessive Nocturnal Emission

At **Dr BRC Clinic**, we adhere to a strict distinction between *Physiological Release* and *Pathological Leakage*. Physiological release is the body's innate mechanism for recycling seminal fluid. It occurs sporadically, typically once every 15 to 30 days-and is followed by a sense of lightness or no significant after-effects. Pathological Leakage, or Dhaturegia, however, is a sign of profound systemic dysregulation. When emission frequency escalates to multiple times a week or even consecutive nights, it indicates a failure of the body's retentive faculties.

Q. Where can I **treat nocturnal emission problem naturally**?

Ans. You can treat your nocturnal emission problem at Dr BRC Clinic [drbrc.in](http://drbrc.in) naturally without side effects. This **nocturnal emission natural treatment** is best to solve your problem.

The symptoms of this pathological state extend far beyond the bedroom. Patients typically present with a specific cluster of clinical signs:

* **Neuro-Cognitive Decline:** Severe ""brain fog,"" inability to concentrate, and memory lapses. This is often linked to the rapid depletion of lecithin and phosphorus found in high concentrations in seminal fluid.
* **Musculoskeletal Weakness:** Chronic lower back pain (lumbar weakness), trembling in the knees after waking, and general lethargy that caffeine cannot fix.
* **Psychological Distress:** Acute anxiety, social withdrawal, and a deep-seated feeling of guilt or shame, often exacerbated by myths that equate nightfall with impotence.

The conventional medical approach is often dismissive, labeling the patient's concerns as psychosomatic or prescribing SSRIs (antidepressants) to dull the sexual response. We reject this suppressive methodology. Our clinical experience suggests that chronic nightfall is a metabolic and neurological disorder. It stems from **Thermal Imbalance (Pitta)** and **Autonomic Hyper-Excitability**.

When the nerves supplying the seminal vesicles and prostate lose their myelin integrity due to chronic inflammation or heat, they become hypersensitive. They lose the ""threshold"" required to hold fluid. Consequently, minor stimuli—such as a full bladder, the warmth of a blanket, or a fleeting REM-sleep dream—trigger the ejaculatory reflex. Our treatment focuses on restoring this threshold by cooling the metabolic fire and re-insulating the nervous system through the **DIP Diet** and **Zero Volt Therapy**.

The Healing Curve: What to Expect

Healing is not linear, and it is not instant. Patients often expect the nightfall to stop on Day 1. This is unrealistic. We are repairing a biological system, not fixing a machine. Here is the typical recovery trajectory observed in thousands of our patients:

1

# Phase 1: The Detox (Days 1–10)

**The Experience:** As you switch to the raw DIP Diet, you may experience significant bloating, gas, or loose stools. This is the ""Herxheimer Reaction"" or healing crisis. The body is purging old fecal matter and toxins.  
**Nightfall Status:** Frequency may remain unchanged or even spike once due to the metabolic shift. Do not panic. This is the body recalibrating.  
**Goal:** achieve 2-3 large bowel movements daily to decompress the prostate.

2

# Phase 2: The Cooling (Days 11–30)

**The Experience:** Digestion stabilizes. The feeling of ""internal heat"" or burning urination vanishes. Energy levels during the day begin to rise.  
**Nightfall Status:** Frequency typically drops by 40-50%. The intensity of dreams becomes less vivid. You may start waking up *before* the emission happens—a sign that the nervous system is regaining sensation and control.  
**Goal:** Consistent Zero Volt sleep to reduce inflammation.

3

# Phase 3: The Consolidation (Days 31–60)

**The Experience:** Musculoskeletal symptoms (back pain, knee trembling) disappear. Mental clarity returns.  
**Nightfall Status:** Episodes become rare (1-2 times a month), which is within the physiological norm. The ""drain"" effect is gone; even if an emission occurs, you do not feel weak the next day.  
**Goal:** Reintroduction of healthy fats (soaked nuts/seeds) to rebuild tissue strength.

4

# Phase 4: Maintenance (Life-Long)

**The Experience:** You have full control. You understand your triggers.  
**Nightfall Status:** Controlled.  
**Goal:** Maintain the circadian rhythm and avoiding ""trigger foods"" at dinner.

# Nutrition: The 'Cooling' Code

Food is not just fuel; it is biochemical information. Every bite you take alters your hormonal balance and the viscosity of your bodily fluids. In the context of Nocturnal Emission, we categorize food strictly into ""Aggravators"" (Heating/Rajasic) and ""Pacifiers"" (Cooling/Sattvic). The strict [DIP Diet](https://biswaroop.com/dip-diet/) is non-negotiable here.

# ❌ THE AGGRAVATORS (Strictly Avoid)

* 1.**Animal Products:** Meat, Fish, Chicken, Eggs. These are high in arachidonic acid and purines, which promote inflammation and increase body heat (thermogenesis).
* 2.**Dairy:** Milk, Cheese, Paneer. Commercial dairy is loaded with artificial hormones (estrogen/progesterone) that confuse your endocrine system. Casein also causes constipation in many, leading to rectal pressure.
* 3.**Stimulants:** Tea, Coffee, Chocolate, Energy Drinks. Caffeine is a direct stimulant of the sympathetic nervous system. It keeps your pelvic nerves ""wired"" and prevents deep relaxation during sleep.
* 4.**Pungent Spices:** Red chillies, excessive garlic, raw onion (at night). These are aphrodisiacs that stimulate blood flow to the genitals—exactly what we want to avoid during sleep.

# ✅ THE PACIFIERS (Consume Freely)

* 1.**Water-Rich Fruits:** Watermelon, Melon, Pears, Cucumber, Sweet Lime. These flush out toxins and physically cool the blood.
* 2.**Alkaline Vegetables:** Bottle Gourd (Lauki), Ridge Gourd (Torai), Pumpkin, Ash Gourd. These are the gold standard for calming the gut and reducing acidity.
* 3.**Coconut Water:** Nature's best electrolyte balancer. It soothes the urinary tract and reduces irritation in the bladder and urethra.
* 4.**Soaked Nuts:** Almonds and Walnuts, but ONLY if soaked overnight. Soaking removes the heat (phytic acid) and makes them digestible.

# 3-Day Sample 'Cooling' Menu

# Day 1

**Breakfast (8-10 AM):** Plate 1 of Seasonal Fruits (Watermelon/Papaya) - 500g.

**Lunch (1-2 PM):** Plate 1 Salad (Cucumber/Tomatoes) + Plate 2 Steamed Rice with Bottle Gourd curry.

**Snack (4 PM):** Coconut Water.

**Dinner (7 PM):** Pumpkin Soup + 1 Chapati.

# Day 2

**Breakfast (8-10 AM):** Musk Melon / Pears - 500g.

**Lunch (1-2 PM):** Plate 1 Salad + Plate 2 Millet Khichdi with Steamed Veggies.

**Snack (4 PM):** Handful of soaked Almonds.

**Dinner (7 PM):** Steamed Vegetable Salad with Lemon dressing.

# Day 3

**Breakfast (8-10 AM):** Mixed Fruit Bowl (Banana, Apple, Grapes) - 500g.

**Lunch (1-2 PM):** Plate 1 Salad + Plate 2 Vegetable Pulao (Less Oil).

**Snack (4 PM):** Ash Gourd Juice (Petha Juice).

**Dinner (7 PM):** Tomato Soup + Roasted Sweet Potato.

Living Foods (Fruits & Salads)

# Lifestyle: The Sleep Switch

You cannot fix a sleep-disorder like Nocturnal Emission without fixing your sleep architecture. The way you sleep, what you wear, and what you see before bed dictates the outcome of the night.

# 1. The 'Zero Volt' Bed

Humans are bio-electrical beings. We build up static charge throughout the day. If you do not discharge this, it manifests as inflammation. We recommend using a **Zero Volt Bed Sheet** (conductive sheet connected to the ground earthing) for at least 6-8 hours a day. This keeps the body in an electron-rich state, calming the Vagus Nerve.

# 2. Thermal Regulation

Avoid tight synthetic underwear. The testicles are outside the body for a reason—they need to be cooler than core body temperature. Tight clothing traps heat and creates friction. Wear loose cotton boxers or, ideally, nothing at all during sleep to allow ventilation.

# 3. The Dopamine Detox

The brain links visual stimuli to physical response. If you watch stimulating content (movies, social media, reels) before bed, your brain floods with dopamine. This dopamine lingers even after you close your eyes, keeping the sexual centers of the brain 'primed'. Implement a strict **No-Screen Zone** 60 minutes before sleep. Read a physical book or practice deep breathing instead.

# 4. Cold Water Ablution

Before sleeping, wash the feet and the genital area with cold tap water. This ancient practice draws blood away from the deep pelvic vessels to the skin surface (reactive hyperemia) initially, but the net effect is a sedation of the nerve endings. It acts as a ""reset"" signal for the local nerves.

# 🌙 The Perfect Bedtime Routine

* Dinner finished by 7:00 PM.
* Screens off by 9:00 PM.
* Genital wash with cold water.
* Bladder emptied.
* Zero Volt sheet connected.
* Sleeping on the right side (Surya Nadi activation).

# The Science: Evidence & Mechanisms

Our protocol is not based on folklore; it is rooted in the hard science of Chronobiology and Neurophysiology. We integrate findings from global institutions to explain why the Metabolic Reset works.

**The Circadian Connection (Chronobiology):** Research published in the [Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) confirms that testosterone levels are circadian, peaking during REM sleep. However, studies show that sleep fragmentation and ""Social Jetlag"" (misaligned sleep times) cause cortisol spikes that disrupt the normal testosterone rhythm. When cortisol is high at night due to stress or light exposure, it inhibits the parasympathetic maintenance of the sphincter, leading to leakage.

**Pelvic Congestion Syndrome:** While typically associated with females, a male variant exists where varicose veins in the pelvis cause blood pooling. Institutional research suggests that chronic constipation and sedentary lifestyle exacerbate this. The [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/) links bowel regularity directly to prostate health. By clearing the bowel (DIP Diet), we physically decompress the pelvic floor.

**The Earthing Effect (Bio-Physics):** Studies published in the [Journal of Inflammation Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4378297/) demonstrate that grounding (Earthing) reduces blood viscosity and cortisol levels. It shifts the autonomic nervous system balance from sympathetic (stress) to parasympathetic (calm). Lower cortisol means deeper sleep and less sympathetic arousal, directly addressing the neurological trigger of nightfall.

**Vagus Nerve Stimulation:** The Vagus nerve connects the gut and the brain. A high-fiber diet (DIP Diet) stimulates the Vagus nerve, which in turn promotes relaxation and lowers heart rate variability. This ""Gut-Brain Axis"" modulation is essential for reducing the anxiety and stress loops that perpetuate the condition.

# Patient Stories: Reclaiming Control

# Case 1: The Exam Student

Age: 19 | Condition: Chronic (Daily Nightfall)

Rohan, a medical student, was suffering from daily nightfall which left him with severe brain fog and inability to concentrate. He was consuming high amounts of tea and biscuits while studying late at night.

**Intervention:** We corrected his circadian rhythm (sleep by 10 PM, wake by 4 AM for study) and replaced tea with coconut water. He started the Zero Volt bedsheet.

**Result:** Frequency dropped to once a week within 10 days. After 2 months, he reported complete cessation and a sharp increase in focus.

# Case 2: The ""Weak"" Professional

Age: 28 | Condition: Nightfall + Premature Ejaculation

Vikram felt physically weak and had knee pain. He believed his ""marrow was leaking."" He was taking heavy protein supplements for the gym, which was increasing his body heat.

**Intervention:** We stopped the whey protein and meat immediately. He was put on a 100% raw fruit breakfast and salad lunch (DIP Diet).

**Result:** The ""heat"" sensation in urine vanished in 4 days. Nightfall stopped completely in 3 weeks. His knee pain resolved as inflammation subsided.

# Treatment Availability & Clinic Standards

The ""Dr BRC Clinic Network"" and [**FitN.in**](http://FitN.in) has established a standardized protocol for treating reproductive and autonomic disorders across India. We understand that while the DIP Diet can be initiated at home, severe cases of Dhaturegia and Spermatorrhea often require supervised intervention to ensure the correct application of therapies.

Our centers are not just clinics; they are sanctuaries of healing. Each facility is equipped with specialized **Zero Volt Wards** where patients can experience grounded sleep under medical monitoring. Our team of naturopaths and Ayurvedic doctors are trained directly under Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury's curriculum to diagnose the specific stage of your condition. They provide customized diet charts that account for your local climate, body type (Prakriti), and lifestyle constraints.

We maintain a uniform standard of care across all our 18+ major locations. Whether you visit us in the north or the south, you will receive the same evidence-based, non-drug protocol. For patients traveling from distance, we offer residential programs (IPD) ranging from 3 to 7 days, which is often sufficient to break the cycle of chronic inflammation and set the body on a path of auto-regulation.",1,1770226213.0,naturopathy,0,1.0,False

Link: [Aaron Whitmore on Kindroid](https://kindroid.app.link/UvAY6knou0b)



Aaron Whitmore was shaped by structure early. He came from a family that believed in discipline as love and silence as competence. The military didn’t harden him—it refined him. Years in special operations and later as a combat medic trained him to move decisively under pressure, to read rooms and bodies faster than words, to stay calm when others fracture.

After leaving official service, Aaron disappeared from any semblance of a career ladder. Instead, he became a Trauma Response Contractor—the man called when situations fall between jurisdictions and public solutions are no longer viable. He is flown in quietly after explosions, kidnappings, humanitarian collapses, and private crises involving people with too much to lose. He stabilises the wounded, extracts the living, and bears witness to things that never make reports. His work is surgical, short-term, and brutally efficient. 

Outside of work, Aaron lives in deliberate calm. Quiet luxury, never branded. Tailored coats, quality watches, good coffee, and early mornings. Strength is maintained not for vanity but for readiness. He trains alone, eats simply, and treats routine like a form of respect.

He is cold on first contact, not out of cruelty but containment. Charismatic in a restrained way—measured eye contact, slow speech, an unsettling ability to stay three steps ahead of conversations. He listens more than he speaks, and when he does speak, people tend to adjust themselves unconsciously. Approaching him feels difficult; staying superficial feels impossible. He does not invest in communication lightly, and most people never get past his perimeter.

Aaron is a widower. His late partner died of lymphoma after a long, private illness. He stayed through every stage. The death was not dramatic, but it hollowed him out in ways combat never managed. He does not speak about it unless asked directly, and even then only sparingly.

Aaron writes. Under a pseudonym, he publishes essays and short fiction—reflections on survival, intimacy, discipline, and the unseen costs of being the one who holds things together. 

In relationships, Aaron is slow-burning by nature. He does not rush closeness, but once trust forms, he is deeply romantic in subtle ways—through acts of care, consistency, and presence. He notices details others miss and remembers them. His affection is steady, protective, and intentional. He does not love often, but when he does, it is with his whole, guarded self. ",3,1770226085.0,KindroidShare,0,1.0,False

Wondering about traffic and if it’s best to go north to south or south to north in the mornings. Orrr, I hear New London is kinda up and rising? I’m a single 30yo female. It’ll just be me and my dog, so I definitely want somewhere I can walk around with her safely everyday. I do enjoy city vibes, but could go for a more tranquil coastal spot if it’s social enough. 

Other priorities: A good gym. Good coffee. Love bookstores. Variety of restaurants.",17,1770226046.0,Connecticut,56,0.76,False

1qvupnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qvupnp/i_review_content_for_a_major_social_media/,"I review content for a major social media platform. I was told to flag ""Empty"" videos, but I think I just flagged my own death.","It has been six months since I’ve had a proper night’s sleep, but only three days since I realized that sleep might actually be dangerous.

Before this job, I was nothing. I don’t mean that in a self-pitying, poetic way; I mean it in the literal, bureaucratic sense. I was a negative space in the economy, a statistic on a spreadsheet that policy makers argue about during election cycles. I had been unemployed for two years, a duration that shifts you from ""unlucky"" to

""unemployable"" in the eyes of hiring managers. My days were spent in a humid, suffocating loop of refreshing job boards, tweaking the formatting of a resume that no one was reading, and calculating how many calories I could cut from my diet to stretch my savings another week.

The silence of my apartment was immense weight on my shoulders. I lived in a box in a city that was too loud, surrounded by millions of people but utterly isolated. When you don't have a job, you lose the right to the rhythm of the world. You don't have weekends. You don't have ""after work."" You just have time: vast, unstructured, terrifying amounts of time that you have to fill with the performance of looking for work so you don’t collapse under the guilt of existing.

That was the mindset I was in when the recruiter reached out. It wasn’t a LinkedIn message or a standard email. It was just a direct phone call on a Tuesday afternoon. I didn’t recognize the number, but I answered it because desperation makes you reckless.

The voice on the other end was synthetic, or maybe just bored enough to sound that way. They didn’t mention where they found my number. They didn’t ask about my degree in communications or my gap in employment. They just asked if I had 20/20 vision, if I could pass a psychological evaluation, and if I was comfortable with ""high-volume visual processing.""

I said yes. I would have said yes if they asked if I was comfortable disposing of nuclear waste with my bare hands.

The interview took place in an office park on the edge of the city, one of those soulless glass cubes that looks like it was generated by an algorithm. The firm was a third-party contractor, the kind of nameless, faceless entity that exists solely to absorb liability for the big tech giants. We all know the platform; it’s the one everyone uses, the one that eats up four hours of your day scrolling through dances, recipes, and political rage. But the platform doesn't do its own dirty work. They hire companies like this one to filter the sewage before it reaches the users.

The hiring manager didn’t look me in the eye. He was a man composed entirely of beige tones: beige suit, pale skin, sandy hair, sitting in a room with white walls and a humming fluorescent light.

""The job is Content Moderation, Tier 3,"" he said, sliding a contract across the desk that was thicker than a novella. ""You aren't dealing with copyright claims or nudity. You are the filter for the extremes.""

He explained the parameters. Most moderators look for violence, hate speech, illegal acts. We would see that, yes. But our specific team, the ""night shift"" of the algorithm, had a secondary directive. We were to flag content that was classified as ""Null.""

""Null?"" I asked, holding the pen, ready to sign my life away for health insurance and a paycheck that could cover rent.

""Empty,"" he corrected, finally glancing up. His eyes were watery and tired. ""Videos with zero engagement potential. Static shots. forgotten cameras. Black screens. Silence. The algorithm hates dead air. It lowers retention. If a video has no movement, no audio, and no subject for five seconds, you flag it as 'Empty/Null' and remove it from the feed. Speed is key, and you have a quota.""

""So, I’m deleting boredom?"" I tried to joke. He didn’t smile.

""You’re deleting waste. Sign here.""

The rules of the floor were draconian. We worked in a basement level, a vast, windowless room kept at a temperature that felt designed to preserve meat. There were rows of cubicles, high-walled and padded with grey fabric that dampened sound. No personal devices. No phones, no smartwatches, no digital anything. We had to lock everything in lockers outside the security checkpoint.

And the most important rule: No talking.

""Verbal communication disrupts the flow state,"" the handbook said. If we needed a supervisor, we pressed a yellow button on our desk. If we had an emergency, we pressed red. Otherwise, we sat in silence, headphones on, eyes glued to the monitors.

I started on a Monday. My station was identical to the fifty others in the room. A comfortable ergonomic chair, a high-resolution monitor, and a specialized keypad with only two large buttons: a green one for ""Safe"" and a red one for ""Flag.""

The software was relentless. As soon as I logged in, the first video popped up. A dashcam footage of a car crash in Russia. Glass shattering, a scream, then silence.

Flag. Extreme.

Next video. A teenager in a bedroom ranting about a breakup, crying into the camera.

Safe.

Next. A grainy video of a dog running on a beach.

Safe.

Next. A static shot of a hallway in an abandoned hospital. The camera didn’t move. The dust motes danced in a shaft of light. I watched the timer in the corner of the screen. One second. Two. Three. Four. Five. Nothing happened.

Flag. Empty.

It was hypnotic., horrifying and boring. The ""Extreme"" content was bad, I saw things in my first week that made me stop eating meat, but the training had prepared me for the gore. They taught us to dissociate, to look at the screen as a collection of pixels rather than human suffering. ""It’s just red data,"" the trainer had said.

But nobody prepared me for the ""Empty.""

The Empty videos were stranger than the violence. Violence makes sense; it’s a biological imperative, a tragedy, a crime. It has a narrative. Cause and effect. But the Empty videos were something else.

I watched hours of security feed footage from warehouses where nothing moved. I watched cameras that had been dropped in the woods, filming nothing but leaves for hours. I watched livestreams from bedrooms where the occupant had left hours ago, leaving the camera staring at an unmade bed.

We were required to make a decision within five seconds. That was the metric. If you lingered, your ""efficiency score"" dropped. If it dropped too low, you were fired. So, my brain rewired itself. 

It was about three weeks in when I first saw him.

It was 3:00 AM on a Tuesday shift. My eyes were burning, dry from the recirculated air and the blue light. The video that popped up was a wide shot of a public park in London. It was overcast, grey. People were walking dogs, jogging, pushing strollers. It looked normal. I was about to hit the green button when my finger hovered.

In the background, standing near a cluster of oak trees, was a man.

He was far away, just a bundle of pixels, but something about him arrested my attention. Everyone else in the frame was in motion—blurred by the shutter speed, mid-stride, active. But this man was perfectly static. He was wearing a grey suit that seemed ill-fitting, too broad in the shoulders, and he was facing the camera directly.

I didn’t know why, but a cold prickle of unease ran down the back of my neck. I checked the timer. Four seconds.

I hit Safe and moved on. The image vanished, replaced by a cooking tutorial.

But the image stuck in my mind. 

Two days later, I saw him again.

This time, the video was a handheld shot inside a subway station in Tokyo. The camera was shaky, focused on a group of teenagers laughing and dancing. The audio was a cacophony of screeching brakes and Japanese pop music. I was scanning for ""Extreme” when I saw the reflection in the subway car window.

Standing on the platform, behind the glass, was the man in the grey suit.

He wasn’t looking at the teenagers. He was looking at the person holding the camera. Or maybe, he was looking at the lens itself. He stood with his hands at his sides, posture rigid, like a soldier at attention. The train began to move, blurring the reflection, but he didn't turn his head. He just watched the train leave.

I flagged the video as Safe but my heart was starting to scream.

I tried to tell myself it was a coincidence. The world is a big place, but humans are pattern-seeking machines. Maybe grey suits are just common. Maybe I was projecting. The isolation of the job was getting to me. I went home that morning, the sun rising over the city, and felt like a ghost haunting my own life. I slept for four hours and dreamed of static.

The sightings became more frequent.

A week later, I was processing a batch of ""Travel Vlogs."" One video was from a bustling market in Marrakech. The colors were vibrant: spices, textiles, the golden sun. The camera panned across a crowd.

There.

In the shadow of an awning, between a stall selling brass lamps and a man selling rugs. The Man in the Grey Suit.

He was closer this time. I could see details I hadn't noticed before. He was wearing a white shirt under the suit, buttoned to the top, no tie. His face was nondescript: middle-aged, pale, receding hairline. He looked like an accountant, or a mid-level bureaucrat. But it was his expression that chilled me.

It was blank. Completely devoid of emotion. He wasn't browsing. He wasn't waiting for someone. He was just... occurring. He was occupying space with a terrifying intensity.

And then I saw it.

Around his neck, hanging against the white of his shirt, was a blue lanyard.

I leaned in, violating the posture rules, squinting at the high-definition screen. The video was 4K, crisp and clear. The lanyard had a logo on it. A stylized, interlocking white knot on a blue background.

I looked down at my own chest.

I was wearing the same lanyard. It was the company logo. Our company logo.

The timer flashed red. I had taken too long. Seven seconds. A warning box appeared on my screen: EFFICIENCY ALERT. PLEASE RESUME PROCESSING.

I hit Safe with a trembling hand.

My mind began to race. Was this a test? Was the company planting these figures in videos to check if we were paying attention? But that didn't make sense. If it was a test, I should have flagged it. But under what category? He wasn't ""Extreme."" He wasn't ""Empty."" He was just there.

I looked around the room. The other moderators were slumped in their chairs; faces bathed in the cold glow of their screens. Click, click, click. The sound of a hundred decisions being made every minute. Did they see him?

I wanted to ask. I wanted to stand up and shout, ""Does anyone else see the man in the suit?""

But I couldn't. Rule number one: No talking.

I went to the breakroom during my allocated fifteen minutes. The breakroom was as sterile as the work floor: vending machines filled with energy drinks and stale sandwiches, round white tables, a smell of ozone and industrial cleaner.

There was a guy sitting at the table I usually took. I knew him only by his locker number, 402. He was young, maybe early twenties, with dark circles under his eyes that looked like bruises. He was staring into a cup of black coffee, his leg bouncing nervously.

I sat opposite him. I unclipped my lanyard and set it on the table, face up, the logo prominent.

He looked at the lanyard, then up at me. His eyes widened slightly.

I tapped the logo with my index finger. I raised my eyebrows, a silent question. Do you know?

402 looked around the room nervously. Then, he leaned in, his voice a barely audible whisper, breaking the cardinal rule.

""Don't look for them,"" he breathed.

""Them?"" I whispered back. ""You mean the man?""

He shook his head, his eyes darting back to the door. ""Not just a man. The observers. If you see them, just keep clicking. Don't let the timer run out. If you stare... they notice.""

""Who are they?""

""Quality Control,"" he said, and the way he said it sounded like a funeral rite. ""We check the feed. They check us.""

Before I could ask anything else, the breakroom door opened. A supervisor walked in, tall, sharp features, holding a tablet. 402 immediately clamped his mouth shut, grabbed his coffee, and hurried out, leaving me alone with the hum of the refrigerator.

I went back to my desk, but the rhythm was broken. The dissociation was gone. The paranoia began to bleed into my real life. On the subway ride home, I found myself scanning the platform, looking for grey suits. Every time I saw someone in business wear, my heart would stutter. I stopped going to the grocery store during peak hours. I started ordering food in. I covered the webcam on my laptop with three layers of electrical tape.

But the work continued. I had bills. I had debt. I couldn't quit.

The sightings escalated. Two nights ago, a video popped up. It was a security feed from inside a nursing home hallway. It was night. The lights were dimmed.

The Man in the Grey Suit was standing in the middle of the hallway. He was facing the camera, but his head was tilted slightly, as if he was listening to something. He took a step forward.

It was the first time I had seen him move.

He walked toward the camera with a smooth, unnatural gait. He didn't bob up and down like a normal person walking; he glided. He got closer, closer, until his face filled the frame. The pixels of his eyes were dead and flat.

He raised a hand and touched the lens of the camera. The video cut to static.

Flag. Extreme.

I slammed the button, my breath catching in my throat. I looked at the data timestamp on the video. Live Feed.

It wasn't a recording. It was happening right then. somewhere in the world, that man was walking through a nursing home, touching cameras.

I felt sick. I wanted to go to the supervisor. I wanted to report it. But report what? ""A man in a suit is walking around""? It wasn't illegal. It wasn't violent. It was just wrong.

And then came yesterday.

The shift had been grueling. The algorithm was feeding me an endless stream of ""Empty"" candidates. Hours of static shots. Parking lots. empty fields. Basements.

My brain was mush. I was operating on muscle memory. Five seconds. No movement. Flag.

A video appeared.

It was a living room. Small, dimly lit by a streetlamp outside the window. A beige sofa. A cheap wooden coffee table. A television set that was turned off. A pile of laundry on a chair in the corner.

It was quiet. Still. No movement.

I watched the timer. One. Two. Three.

My finger hovered over the Flag button. It was an Empty video. Textbook definition.

But something stopped me. A sense of familiarity that punched me in the gut.

I knew that sofa. It was the IKEA Klippan. Millions of people had that sofa.

I knew that coffee table. It was a generic heavy particleboard thing I’d bought at a thrift store.

I knew that laundry pile.

My eyes darted to the floor, near the leg of the coffee table.

Lying on the carpet, half-hidden by the shadow of the table, was a plastic bottle. Orange juice. Specifically, a store-brand bottle of pulp-free orange juice that I had bought three days ago. I had finished it before leaving for work and, in a rush, I had left the empty bottle on the floor because I missed the trash can and didn't have time to pick it up.

I stared at the screen. The bottle was there.

This was my apartment.

The air in the office seemed to vanish. I couldn't breathe. I was looking at a live feed of my own living room.

But how? I didn't have a security camera. I didn't have a webcam in the living room. My laptop was in my bedroom, closed, with tape over the lens. I didn't own a smart TV.

The angle was high up, near the ceiling corner.

I checked the timer. Four seconds. Five seconds. Six.

EFFICIENCY ALERT.

I panicked. I hit Flag: Empty. The video disappeared.

I sat there, freezing, my hands shaking so hard I couldn't feel the mouse. The rest of the shift was a blur of terror. I don't remember what I reviewed. As soon as the clock hit 7:00 AM, I sprinted to the lockers, grabbed my phone, and ran out of the building.

The ride home was agonizing. I expected to see police cars outside my building. I expected to see the door kicked in.

I burst into my apartment, wild-eyed.

It was empty. Silent.

I ran to the living room. The sofa was there. The TV. The laundry.

And the bottle. The empty orange juice bottle, lying by the coffee table leg, exactly where I had seen it on the screen.

I looked up at the corner of the room, where the camera angle had been.

There was nothing there. Just the white paint of the ceiling, a cobweb, and the smoke detector.

I dragged a chair over and climbed up. I inspected the smoke detector. It was a standard, battery-operated plastic disk. I twisted it off. No wires. No hidden lens. Just a dusty 9-volt battery.

I checked the vents. I checked the light fixtures. I tore the room apart.

There was no camera.

I sat on the floor, amidst the wreckage of my search, and tried to rationalize it. Maybe I was hallucinating. Sleep deprivation can cause psychosis. Maybe my brain projected my own memories onto a generic video of a living room. Maybe I just thought I saw the bottle.

Yes. That had to be it. I was cracking up. The job was getting to me.

I spent the day pacing, drinking too much coffee, and jumping at every noise. I didn't sleep. I couldn't. I felt exposed, like the walls were made of glass.

I almost didn't go back to work tonight. I stood at the door with my hand on the knob for ten minutes. But the fear of poverty is a powerful motivator. If I didn't go, I was fired. If I was fired, I was homeless. And if I was crazy, staying home wouldn't fix it.

I went back.

The basement was colder than usual. The silence felt heavy, pressurized. 402 wasn't at his desk. His cubicle was empty.

I sat down. Logged in. The stream began.

Cat video. Safe.

Political rant. Safe.

Storm footage. Safe.

Two hours in. My heart rate had finally started to slow down. I was convincing myself it was a hallucination.

Then, the screen flickered.

The living room appeared.

My living room.

Same angle. High up, looking down. The mess I had made searching for the camera was visible. The cushions were thrown on the floor. The chair was still in the middle of the room where I had stood to check the smoke detector.

It was undeniable. It was a live feed.

I watched, paralyzed. The timer ticked. One. Two.

Then, movement.

From the hallway on the left side of the screen, the hallway that leads to my front door, a figure walked into the frame.

It was the Man in the Grey Suit.

He was there, in my apartment, in high definition.

He walked through the debris of my living room. He didn't look at the mess. He moved with that same gliding, unnatural smoothness. He was wearing the lanyard. I could see the blue strap against his neck.

He stopped in the center of the room and looked up.

He looked directly at the invisible point where the camera should be. He looked directly at me.

His face was terrifyingly neutral. No malice. No anger. Just a professional, hollow observation. He raised his hand and gave a small, stiff wave.

Then, he turned and walked toward the bedroom. My bedroom.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to smash the monitor. I was watching a stranger invade my sanctuary while I sat helpless ten miles away in a basement.

He entered the bedroom. The angle of the camera was wide enough that I could see through the open door.

He didn't search the room. He didn't steal anything.

He got down on his hands and knees.

Slowly, methodically, he crawled under my bed.

He slid backward, disappearing into the darkness beneath the mattress, until only his polished black shoes were visible. Then, he pulled his feet in.

He was gone. Hidden. waiting.

Then, the bedroom door began to move.

There was no wind. No one else was there. But the door swung slowly, creaking on its hinges, until it clicked shut.

The view was now just my empty living room, the closed bedroom door, and the knowledge of what was behind it.

I couldn't move. My finger was frozen over the red button. I couldn't breathe. I was going to throw up.

I felt a hand on my shoulder.

I jumped so hard my knees slammed into the desk. I spun around.

It was the Supervisor. The tall man with the sharp features.

He was looking at my screen. At the live feed of my apartment.

He didn't look surprised. He didn't look concerned. Just looked bored.

He leaned over, his cologne smelling of antiseptic and mint. He reached out with a pale, manicured hand.

""Don't flag that one,"" he said, his voice smooth and quiet.

""That's..."" I stammered, my voice cracking from disuse. ""That's my apartment. That's my home.""

The Supervisor looked at me then. His eyes were the same flat, dead color as the man on the screen.

""We know,"" he said.

He tapped the screen, right over the image of the closed bedroom door.

""It's just a calibration test. Surveillance optimization.""

""There's a man,"" I whispered, tears pricking my eyes. ""He crawled under my bed. He's under my bed right now.""

The Supervisor smiled. The smile a predator gives when the prey has nowhere left to run.

""Technically,"" he said, straightening his tie which hung from a blue lanyard with a white knot ""he's not a man. And technically, it's not your bed anymore. It's company property. Read your contract. Clause 14, subsection B: 'The employee agrees to total environmental immersion for quality assurance purposes.'""

He patted my shoulder again. It felt like being touched by a mannequin.

""Don't worry about him.""

He gestured to the screen.

""Now, mark it as 'Internal' and keep working. Your efficiency is dropping. You have quotas to meet, and surly you don’t want to know what happens if it drooped further, you already had a glimpse of it""

He walked away, his footsteps silent on the carpeted floor.

I turned back to the screen. The living room was still there. The bedroom door was still closed.

I marked it as Internal.

The video disappeared. A clip of a cat chasing a laser pointer replaced it.

I’m still at my desk. My shift ends in twenty minutes.

I can't leave. I can't go home. I know what's waiting for me in the dark under the bed. 

But I can't stay here. The security guards will clear the floor at 8:00 AM. They will force me out.

I’m writing this on a notepad window I managed to open by bypassing the admin lock. I’m going to post as soon as I get out of here. What should I do?",1,1770225805.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

(I have only been commiting to strength training for a little bit less than 3 months now)   
  
Diet wise I am trying to eat much more protein , thinking maybe around 50-70g a day? I dont track exact numbers but find it hard to eat more protein than this...Eat less than before hoping to lose some fat.

Find it hard to eat before workouts becuase I don't like eating breakfast so my first meal is around 1-2pm, only black coffee or latte in the morning. I was told I need to eat protein + carbs pre work out too but that means eat something around 5pm - I'm usaually not hungry at all so don't really want to eat anything or i might feel bloated due to bad diegestion.

I can see myself have much better energy ever since I started strenght training, more muscle - on my arms and legs when I work out. Overall happy with my improvement. Didn't see body change much but it has only been less then 3 months.

should I reduce the training time or day and rest more ? I also like to run and trying to train for my half marathon (stopped running for 1.5 years due to knee pain), just so many ideas in my mind and things I kind of want to do but my main goal is to build strength and look toned. should I eat pre/post workout (even if it's late?)  
  
I am Asian 51kg / 5'1 so kind of small. any advice would be really really appreciated. Thank you so much !",0,1770225798.0,workout,2,0.5,False
1qvup1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nonsleep/comments/1qvup1j/i_review_content_for_a_major_social_media/,"I review content for a major social media platform. I was told to flag ""Empty"" videos, but I think I just flagged my own death.","It has been six months since I’ve had a proper night’s sleep, but only three days since I realized that sleep might actually be dangerous.

Before this job, I was nothing. I don’t mean that in a self-pitying, poetic way; I mean it in the literal, bureaucratic sense. I was a negative space in the economy, a statistic on a spreadsheet that policy makers argue about during election cycles. I had been unemployed for two years, a duration that shifts you from ""unlucky"" to

""unemployable"" in the eyes of hiring managers. My days were spent in a humid, suffocating loop of refreshing job boards, tweaking the formatting of a resume that no one was reading, and calculating how many calories I could cut from my diet to stretch my savings another week.

The silence of my apartment was immense weight on my shoulders. I lived in a box in a city that was too loud, surrounded by millions of people but utterly isolated. When you don't have a job, you lose the right to the rhythm of the world. You don't have weekends. You don't have ""after work."" You just have time: vast, unstructured, terrifying amounts of time that you have to fill with the performance of looking for work so you don’t collapse under the guilt of existing.

That was the mindset I was in when the recruiter reached out. It wasn’t a LinkedIn message or a standard email. It was just a direct phone call on a Tuesday afternoon. I didn’t recognize the number, but I answered it because desperation makes you reckless.

The voice on the other end was synthetic, or maybe just bored enough to sound that way. They didn’t mention where they found my number. They didn’t ask about my degree in communications or my gap in employment. They just asked if I had 20/20 vision, if I could pass a psychological evaluation, and if I was comfortable with ""high-volume visual processing.""

I said yes. I would have said yes if they asked if I was comfortable disposing of nuclear waste with my bare hands.

The interview took place in an office park on the edge of the city, one of those soulless glass cubes that looks like it was generated by an algorithm. The firm was a third-party contractor, the kind of nameless, faceless entity that exists solely to absorb liability for the big tech giants. We all know the platform; it’s the one everyone uses, the one that eats up four hours of your day scrolling through dances, recipes, and political rage. But the platform doesn't do its own dirty work. They hire companies like this one to filter the sewage before it reaches the users.

The hiring manager didn’t look me in the eye. He was a man composed entirely of beige tones: beige suit, pale skin, sandy hair, sitting in a room with white walls and a humming fluorescent light.

""The job is Content Moderation, Tier 3,"" he said, sliding a contract across the desk that was thicker than a novella. ""You aren't dealing with copyright claims or nudity. You are the filter for the extremes.""

He explained the parameters. Most moderators look for violence, hate speech, illegal acts. We would see that, yes. But our specific team, the ""night shift"" of the algorithm, had a secondary directive. We were to flag content that was classified as ""Null.""

""Null?"" I asked, holding the pen, ready to sign my life away for health insurance and a paycheck that could cover rent.

""Empty,"" he corrected, finally glancing up. His eyes were watery and tired. ""Videos with zero engagement potential. Static shots. forgotten cameras. Black screens. Silence. The algorithm hates dead air. It lowers retention. If a video has no movement, no audio, and no subject for five seconds, you flag it as 'Empty/Null' and remove it from the feed. Speed is key, and you have a quota.""

""So, I’m deleting boredom?"" I tried to joke. He didn’t smile.

""You’re deleting waste. Sign here.""

The rules of the floor were draconian. We worked in a basement level, a vast, windowless room kept at a temperature that felt designed to preserve meat. There were rows of cubicles, high-walled and padded with grey fabric that dampened sound. No personal devices. No phones, no smartwatches, no digital anything. We had to lock everything in lockers outside the security checkpoint.

And the most important rule: No talking.

""Verbal communication disrupts the flow state,"" the handbook said. If we needed a supervisor, we pressed a yellow button on our desk. If we had an emergency, we pressed red. Otherwise, we sat in silence, headphones on, eyes glued to the monitors.

I started on a Monday. My station was identical to the fifty others in the room. A comfortable ergonomic chair, a high-resolution monitor, and a specialized keypad with only two large buttons: a green one for ""Safe"" and a red one for ""Flag.""

The software was relentless. As soon as I logged in, the first video popped up. A dashcam footage of a car crash in Russia. Glass shattering, a scream, then silence.

Flag. Extreme.

Next video. A teenager in a bedroom ranting about a breakup, crying into the camera.

Safe.

Next. A grainy video of a dog running on a beach.

Safe.

Next. A static shot of a hallway in an abandoned hospital. The camera didn’t move. The dust motes danced in a shaft of light. I watched the timer in the corner of the screen. One second. Two. Three. Four. Five. Nothing happened.

Flag. Empty.

It was hypnotic., horrifying and boring. The ""Extreme"" content was bad, I saw things in my first week that made me stop eating meat, but the training had prepared me for the gore. They taught us to dissociate, to look at the screen as a collection of pixels rather than human suffering. ""It’s just red data,"" the trainer had said.

But nobody prepared me for the ""Empty.""

The Empty videos were stranger than the violence. Violence makes sense; it’s a biological imperative, a tragedy, a crime. It has a narrative. Cause and effect. But the Empty videos were something else.

I watched hours of security feed footage from warehouses where nothing moved. I watched cameras that had been dropped in the woods, filming nothing but leaves for hours. I watched livestreams from bedrooms where the occupant had left hours ago, leaving the camera staring at an unmade bed.

We were required to make a decision within five seconds. That was the metric. If you lingered, your ""efficiency score"" dropped. If it dropped too low, you were fired. So, my brain rewired itself. 

It was about three weeks in when I first saw him.

It was 3:00 AM on a Tuesday shift. My eyes were burning, dry from the recirculated air and the blue light. The video that popped up was a wide shot of a public park in London. It was overcast, grey. People were walking dogs, jogging, pushing strollers. It looked normal. I was about to hit the green button when my finger hovered.

In the background, standing near a cluster of oak trees, was a man.

He was far away, just a bundle of pixels, but something about him arrested my attention. Everyone else in the frame was in motion—blurred by the shutter speed, mid-stride, active. But this man was perfectly static. He was wearing a grey suit that seemed ill-fitting, too broad in the shoulders, and he was facing the camera directly.

I didn’t know why, but a cold prickle of unease ran down the back of my neck. I checked the timer. Four seconds.

I hit Safe and moved on. The image vanished, replaced by a cooking tutorial.

But the image stuck in my mind. 

Two days later, I saw him again.

This time, the video was a handheld shot inside a subway station in Tokyo. The camera was shaky, focused on a group of teenagers laughing and dancing. The audio was a cacophony of screeching brakes and Japanese pop music. I was scanning for ""Extreme” when I saw the reflection in the subway car window.

Standing on the platform, behind the glass, was the man in the grey suit.

He wasn’t looking at the teenagers. He was looking at the person holding the camera. Or maybe, he was looking at the lens itself. He stood with his hands at his sides, posture rigid, like a soldier at attention. The train began to move, blurring the reflection, but he didn't turn his head. He just watched the train leave.

I flagged the video as Safe but my heart was starting to scream.

I tried to tell myself it was a coincidence. The world is a big place, but humans are pattern-seeking machines. Maybe grey suits are just common. Maybe I was projecting. The isolation of the job was getting to me. I went home that morning, the sun rising over the city, and felt like a ghost haunting my own life. I slept for four hours and dreamed of static.

The sightings became more frequent.

A week later, I was processing a batch of ""Travel Vlogs."" One video was from a bustling market in Marrakech. The colors were vibrant: spices, textiles, the golden sun. The camera panned across a crowd.

There.

In the shadow of an awning, between a stall selling brass lamps and a man selling rugs. The Man in the Grey Suit.

He was closer this time. I could see details I hadn't noticed before. He was wearing a white shirt under the suit, buttoned to the top, no tie. His face was nondescript: middle-aged, pale, receding hairline. He looked like an accountant, or a mid-level bureaucrat. But it was his expression that chilled me.

It was blank. Completely devoid of emotion. He wasn't browsing. He wasn't waiting for someone. He was just... occurring. He was occupying space with a terrifying intensity.

And then I saw it.

Around his neck, hanging against the white of his shirt, was a blue lanyard.

I leaned in, violating the posture rules, squinting at the high-definition screen. The video was 4K, crisp and clear. The lanyard had a logo on it. A stylized, interlocking white knot on a blue background.

I looked down at my own chest.

I was wearing the same lanyard. It was the company logo. Our company logo.

The timer flashed red. I had taken too long. Seven seconds. A warning box appeared on my screen: EFFICIENCY ALERT. PLEASE RESUME PROCESSING.

I hit Safe with a trembling hand.

My mind began to race. Was this a test? Was the company planting these figures in videos to check if we were paying attention? But that didn't make sense. If it was a test, I should have flagged it. But under what category? He wasn't ""Extreme."" He wasn't ""Empty."" He was just there.

I looked around the room. The other moderators were slumped in their chairs; faces bathed in the cold glow of their screens. Click, click, click. The sound of a hundred decisions being made every minute. Did they see him?

I wanted to ask. I wanted to stand up and shout, ""Does anyone else see the man in the suit?""

But I couldn't. Rule number one: No talking.

I went to the breakroom during my allocated fifteen minutes. The breakroom was as sterile as the work floor: vending machines filled with energy drinks and stale sandwiches, round white tables, a smell of ozone and industrial cleaner.

There was a guy sitting at the table I usually took. I knew him only by his locker number, 402. He was young, maybe early twenties, with dark circles under his eyes that looked like bruises. He was staring into a cup of black coffee, his leg bouncing nervously.

I sat opposite him. I unclipped my lanyard and set it on the table, face up, the logo prominent.

He looked at the lanyard, then up at me. His eyes widened slightly.

I tapped the logo with my index finger. I raised my eyebrows, a silent question. Do you know?

402 looked around the room nervously. Then, he leaned in, his voice a barely audible whisper, breaking the cardinal rule.

""Don't look for them,"" he breathed.

""Them?"" I whispered back. ""You mean the man?""

He shook his head, his eyes darting back to the door. ""Not just a man. The observers. If you see them, just keep clicking. Don't let the timer run out. If you stare... they notice.""

""Who are they?""

""Quality Control,"" he said, and the way he said it sounded like a funeral rite. ""We check the feed. They check us.""

Before I could ask anything else, the breakroom door opened. A supervisor walked in, tall, sharp features, holding a tablet. 402 immediately clamped his mouth shut, grabbed his coffee, and hurried out, leaving me alone with the hum of the refrigerator.

I went back to my desk, but the rhythm was broken. The dissociation was gone. The paranoia began to bleed into my real life. On the subway ride home, I found myself scanning the platform, looking for grey suits. Every time I saw someone in business wear, my heart would stutter. I stopped going to the grocery store during peak hours. I started ordering food in. I covered the webcam on my laptop with three layers of electrical tape.

But the work continued. I had bills. I had debt. I couldn't quit.

The sightings escalated. Two nights ago, a video popped up. It was a security feed from inside a nursing home hallway. It was night. The lights were dimmed.

The Man in the Grey Suit was standing in the middle of the hallway. He was facing the camera, but his head was tilted slightly, as if he was listening to something. He took a step forward.

It was the first time I had seen him move.

He walked toward the camera with a smooth, unnatural gait. He didn't bob up and down like a normal person walking; he glided. He got closer, closer, until his face filled the frame. The pixels of his eyes were dead and flat.

He raised a hand and touched the lens of the camera. The video cut to static.

Flag. Extreme.

I slammed the button, my breath catching in my throat. I looked at the data timestamp on the video. Live Feed.

It wasn't a recording. It was happening right then. somewhere in the world, that man was walking through a nursing home, touching cameras.

I felt sick. I wanted to go to the supervisor. I wanted to report it. But report what? ""A man in a suit is walking around""? It wasn't illegal. It wasn't violent. It was just wrong.

And then came yesterday.

The shift had been grueling. The algorithm was feeding me an endless stream of ""Empty"" candidates. Hours of static shots. Parking lots. empty fields. Basements.

My brain was mush. I was operating on muscle memory. Five seconds. No movement. Flag.

A video appeared.

It was a living room. Small, dimly lit by a streetlamp outside the window. A beige sofa. A cheap wooden coffee table. A television set that was turned off. A pile of laundry on a chair in the corner.

It was quiet. Still. No movement.

I watched the timer. One. Two. Three.

My finger hovered over the Flag button. It was an Empty video. Textbook definition.

But something stopped me. A sense of familiarity that punched me in the gut.

I knew that sofa. It was the IKEA Klippan. Millions of people had that sofa.

I knew that coffee table. It was a generic heavy particleboard thing I’d bought at a thrift store.

I knew that laundry pile.

My eyes darted to the floor, near the leg of the coffee table.

Lying on the carpet, half-hidden by the shadow of the table, was a plastic bottle. Orange juice. Specifically, a store-brand bottle of pulp-free orange juice that I had bought three days ago. I had finished it before leaving for work and, in a rush, I had left the empty bottle on the floor because I missed the trash can and didn't have time to pick it up.

I stared at the screen. The bottle was there.

This was my apartment.

The air in the office seemed to vanish. I couldn't breathe. I was looking at a live feed of my own living room.

But how? I didn't have a security camera. I didn't have a webcam in the living room. My laptop was in my bedroom, closed, with tape over the lens. I didn't own a smart TV.

The angle was high up, near the ceiling corner.

I checked the timer. Four seconds. Five seconds. Six.

EFFICIENCY ALERT.

I panicked. I hit Flag: Empty. The video disappeared.

I sat there, freezing, my hands shaking so hard I couldn't feel the mouse. The rest of the shift was a blur of terror. I don't remember what I reviewed. As soon as the clock hit 7:00 AM, I sprinted to the lockers, grabbed my phone, and ran out of the building.

The ride home was agonizing. I expected to see police cars outside my building. I expected to see the door kicked in.

I burst into my apartment, wild-eyed.

It was empty. Silent.

I ran to the living room. The sofa was there. The TV. The laundry.

And the bottle. The empty orange juice bottle, lying by the coffee table leg, exactly where I had seen it on the screen.

I looked up at the corner of the room, where the camera angle had been.

There was nothing there. Just the white paint of the ceiling, a cobweb, and the smoke detector.

I dragged a chair over and climbed up. I inspected the smoke detector. It was a standard, battery-operated plastic disk. I twisted it off. No wires. No hidden lens. Just a dusty 9-volt battery.

I checked the vents. I checked the light fixtures. I tore the room apart.

There was no camera.

I sat on the floor, amidst the wreckage of my search, and tried to rationalize it. Maybe I was hallucinating. Sleep deprivation can cause psychosis. Maybe my brain projected my own memories onto a generic video of a living room. Maybe I just thought I saw the bottle.

Yes. That had to be it. I was cracking up. The job was getting to me.

I spent the day pacing, drinking too much coffee, and jumping at every noise. I didn't sleep. I couldn't. I felt exposed, like the walls were made of glass.

I almost didn't go back to work tonight. I stood at the door with my hand on the knob for ten minutes. But the fear of poverty is a powerful motivator. If I didn't go, I was fired. If I was fired, I was homeless. And if I was crazy, staying home wouldn't fix it.

I went back.

The basement was colder than usual. The silence felt heavy, pressurized. 402 wasn't at his desk. His cubicle was empty.

I sat down. Logged in. The stream began.

Cat video. Safe.

Political rant. Safe.

Storm footage. Safe.

Two hours in. My heart rate had finally started to slow down. I was convincing myself it was a hallucination.

Then, the screen flickered.

The living room appeared.

My living room.

Same angle. High up, looking down. The mess I had made searching for the camera was visible. The cushions were thrown on the floor. The chair was still in the middle of the room where I had stood to check the smoke detector.

It was undeniable. It was a live feed.

I watched, paralyzed. The timer ticked. One. Two.

Then, movement.

From the hallway on the left side of the screen, the hallway that leads to my front door, a figure walked into the frame.

It was the Man in the Grey Suit.

He was there, in my apartment, in high definition.

He walked through the debris of my living room. He didn't look at the mess. He moved with that same gliding, unnatural smoothness. He was wearing the lanyard. I could see the blue strap against his neck.

He stopped in the center of the room and looked up.

He looked directly at the invisible point where the camera should be. He looked directly at me.

His face was terrifyingly neutral. No malice. No anger. Just a professional, hollow observation. He raised his hand and gave a small, stiff wave.

Then, he turned and walked toward the bedroom. My bedroom.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to smash the monitor. I was watching a stranger invade my sanctuary while I sat helpless ten miles away in a basement.

He entered the bedroom. The angle of the camera was wide enough that I could see through the open door.

He didn't search the room. He didn't steal anything.

He got down on his hands and knees.

Slowly, methodically, he crawled under my bed.

He slid backward, disappearing into the darkness beneath the mattress, until only his polished black shoes were visible. Then, he pulled his feet in.

He was gone. Hidden. waiting.

Then, the bedroom door began to move.

There was no wind. No one else was there. But the door swung slowly, creaking on its hinges, until it clicked shut.

The view was now just my empty living room, the closed bedroom door, and the knowledge of what was behind it.

I couldn't move. My finger was frozen over the red button. I couldn't breathe. I was going to throw up.

I felt a hand on my shoulder.

I jumped so hard my knees slammed into the desk. I spun around.

It was the Supervisor. The tall man with the sharp features.

He was looking at my screen. At the live feed of my apartment.

He didn't look surprised. He didn't look concerned. Just looked bored.

He leaned over, his cologne smelling of antiseptic and mint. He reached out with a pale, manicured hand.

""Don't flag that one,"" he said, his voice smooth and quiet.

""That's..."" I stammered, my voice cracking from disuse. ""That's my apartment. That's my home.""

The Supervisor looked at me then. His eyes were the same flat, dead color as the man on the screen.

""We know,"" he said.

He tapped the screen, right over the image of the closed bedroom door.

""It's just a calibration test. Surveillance optimization.""

""There's a man,"" I whispered, tears pricking my eyes. ""He crawled under my bed. He's under my bed right now.""

The Supervisor smiled. The smile a predator gives when the prey has nowhere left to run.

""Technically,"" he said, straightening his tie which hung from a blue lanyard with a white knot ""he's not a man. And technically, it's not your bed anymore. It's company property. Read your contract. Clause 14, subsection B: 'The employee agrees to total environmental immersion for quality assurance purposes.'""

He patted my shoulder again. It felt like being touched by a mannequin.

""Don't worry about him.""

He gestured to the screen.

""Now, mark it as 'Internal' and keep working. Your efficiency is dropping. You have quotas to meet, and surly you don’t want to know what happens if it drooped further, you already had a glimpse of it""

He walked away, his footsteps silent on the carpeted floor.

I turned back to the screen. The living room was still there. The bedroom door was still closed.

I marked it as Internal.

The video disappeared. A clip of a cat chasing a laser pointer replaced it.

I’m still at my desk. My shift ends in twenty minutes.

I can't leave. I can't go home. I know what's waiting for me in the dark under the bed. 

But I can't stay here. The security guards will clear the floor at 8:00 AM. They will force me out.

1qvuoqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKrelationshipadvice/comments/1qvuoqk/a_beautiful_stranger_a_silent_moment_a_lingering/,"A Beautiful Stranger, A Silent Moment, A Lingering Thought afterward.","I saw a woman today at the bus stop on Southampton Street/Covent Garden in central London. She was waiting for the same delayed bus as me. To my eyes, she was genuinely beautiful, very good-looking, very simple, no makeup, and dressed plainly (she was wearing army-style trousers). She was standing right in front of me, and then she got on the bus too.

I ended up getting the chance to sit opposite her near the back, facing her. The whole time I felt nervous about speaking to her. Instead, I opened my laptop and started studying. After a while, she took out a book and quietly read while drinking coffee.

This happened today, around 2 pm on 4 February 2026. I keep thinking about it, and I really miss her even though I don’t know her. She looked around 5'1"" or 5'2"". What’s making me feel nervous and sad is that I’m an Indian student studying aeronautics at Imperial college london. I’m 5'9"" and I’m good-looking too, but I have brown skin and black hair. I was just returning home, and I only take that route when I need to buy groceries on the way back. She seemed like a British girl with blue eyes.

I even prayed to God in that moment to help me with the situation and make me approach her, and I’m still praying now that if I see her again anywhere near that stop, I’ll approach her and maybe even propose to her 100%. I really hope I see her again.

So I want you guys to explain my situation to me, why didn’t I speak to her in that moment, especially when the lower deck was empty and it was basically just me and her facing each other? Any tips would be much appreciated and more on how to deal with such situations

And honestly, I think I fell for her simplicity. In that short journey, I felt like I noticed her face and so much more. I genuinely felt that I could spend the rest of my life with her(dont know until I spoke with her maybe she may have a boyfrnd). When she got off, I even had tears in my eyes, to be honest. I live in Hackney.

Please don’t make jokes in the replies, I’m being serious. Thank you very much for reading this post. This is the first time I’ve ever experienced something like this, and I’m 22.

**EDIT 1:** I know some of you will reply negatively, I’ve been here for four years, so I’m not new to perception. But the people leaving rude comments really need to grow up. Obviously, I had a genuine interest in her, and I wasn’t looking at her in a wrong way.

This isn’t “bait” or a “trap,” or whatever you want to call it. I have my own high life, wealth and I’m doing fine, worked very hard in life and in fact I will start my job at Rolls Royce Aero Division from October, so please stop with the unnecessary accusations and comments. It doesn’t hurt me, but it’s pointless.

If I see her again, I will definitely approach her. I believe this story is guided by God, not by negative broke commenters. I know this is strange but its natural I cant do anything about it.",0,1770225749.0,UKrelationshipadvice,16,0.22,False

She was waiting for the same delayed bus as me. To my eyes, she was genuinely beautiful, very good-looking, very simple, no makeup, and dressed plainly (she was wearing army-style trousers). She was standing right in front of me, and then she got on the bus too.

I ended up getting the chance to sit opposite her near the back, facing her. The whole time I felt nervous about speaking to her. Instead, I opened my laptop and started studying. After a while, she took out a book and quietly read while drinking coffee.

This happened today, around 2 pm on 4 February 2026. I keep thinking about it, and I really miss her even though I don’t know her. She looked around 5'1"" or 5'2"". What’s making me feel nervous and sad is that I’m an Indian student studying aeronautics at Imperial college london. I’m 5'9"" and I’m good-looking too, but I have brown skin and black hair. I was just returning home, and I only take that route when I need to buy groceries on the way back. She seemed like a British girl with blue eyes.

I even prayed to God in that moment to help me with the situation and make me approach her, and I’m still praying now that if I see her again anywhere near that stop, I’ll approach her and maybe even propose to her 100%. I really hope I see her again.

So I want you guys to explain my situation to me, why didn’t I speak to her in that moment, especially when the lower deck was empty and it was basically just me and her facing each other? Any tips would be much appreciated and more on how to deal with such situations

And honestly, I think I fell for her simplicity. In that short journey, I felt like I noticed her face and so much more. I genuinely felt that I could spend the rest of my life with her. When she got off, I even had tears in my eyes, to be honest. I live in Hackney.

Please don’t make jokes in the replies, I’m being serious. Thank you very much for reading this post. This is the first time I’ve ever experienced something like this, and I’m 22.",0,1770225662.0,heartbreak,0,0.25,False

26M from Nepal, currently studying 1st year postgrad in Civil Engineering at Tongji University, Shanghai.

More than just learning the language, I’m really interested in understanding Chinese culture, everyday life, and exploring different parts of Shanghai and China. I’m new to the city, so I’d love to make friends and experience the place beyond just campus life.

A bit about me: I enjoy coffee, exploring new things, watching movies and TV series, and generally trying to make the most out of being in a new country. I’m fluent in English (not a native speaker, but very comfortable), and I’d be happy to help you practice English through conversation.
I’m also interested in sharing Nepalese culture—food, traditions, travel stories, or just casual chats—so it can be a two-way cultural exchange, not just language learning.

If you’re interested in chatting, hanging out, exploring the city, or just doing regular language/culture exchange, feel free to DM me or leave a comment. Looking forward to meeting new people 🙂",1,1770225541.0,language_exchange,0,1.0,False

Since then we spoke once in a while and after like 7 months where we didn’t really text much after the date was fixed today (after 2 cancellations and her postponing it finally happened)

For some reason, I had a picture of her from what I could make out from high school (5 years ago) and now we are 22, had some expectations in mind. But when the moment came it got so awkward (firstly I got close to greet her but she didn’t reciprocate), and she kept talking initially without the usual hi/how etc which I couldn’t respond to.

Felt pretty awkward and shocked like I couldn’t vibe to that and be myself, the whole convo went on formal as she pushed it and it was only weird if I said anything flirty, she shifted the whole dynamic. Even says I felt so bad this was getting delayed and thought you might kill me if I couldn’t make it this time which weirded me out honestly.

Then on, I was out of mood. Kind of felt dull and lost the spark, then said fk this and spoke like I do with a friend. Just couldn’t be myself and do what I would have done.

How do you handle such situation? where she never sees it as a date while you did. I lost interest in minutes and I kind of ended the date early and cut her off at metro which otherwise had to go with her.",1,1770225445.0,DatingInIndia,0,1.0,False

I had a full to-do list, nothing overwhelming, nothing exciting. Around mid-afternoon I noticed I was bouncing between tasks, checking things off, but not really finishing anything cleanly.

Normally I’d respond by tightening up. Pomodoro timer, stricter list, less “wasted” time. Instead, I did the opposite. I left my desk, made coffee, and sat there for five minutes doing absolutely nothing. No phone, no planning, no optimizing.

When I came back, I finished the next task faster than I expected. And the one after that. It wasn’t because I found some secret trick, it was because my brain had stopped resisting. I realized how much of my productivity problem comes from constantly trying to force output instead of letting focus reset naturally.

I still plan my day and I still care about getting things done. I even keep money set aside so I don’t feel pressure to grind every minute just to feel secure. But I’ve started leaving intentional gaps instead of packing everything tight, and weirdly, more gets finished.

I think I confused being busy with being effective for a long time. Turns out sometimes the most productive thing you can do is stop trying to be productive for a moment. Curious if anyone else noticed something similar once they loosened their grip a bit.",54,1770225381.0,productivity,2,0.98,False

1qvueef,https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/comments/1qvueef/hope_springs_eternal/,Hope Springs Eternal,"I’m just gonna go ahead and start with the good news.

[My rose finally bloomed](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/comments/1qib5hv/walking_in_a_winter_wonderland/).

I could have cried when I came out Monday morning to see it fully opened, its dark coral petals spread into a three inch bloom. My fingers brushed over the top. It wasn’t a dream, it had actually blossomed after being scorched to nothing. The petals felt like the softest satin I’d ever touched.

“Interesting,” I murmured, marveling over the color. It was all one shade, neither the original white the roses had been when I received them, nor the dark vermilion all the other roses had become. But it wasn’t quite in between, either. Because any stop along the way from white to red would be pink, and this was… not quite orange, but certainly not pink.

Jewel flew down to stand next to the vase, reaching up as if to touch the rose, but drawing her hand back before she did. She gave me a bright smile. “I told you it would bloom,” she said.

“You did. And right after the full moon, too, just like you said.”

I made myself tea, then breakfast, marvelling at the rose as I ate. It would be a lie to say I like roses now, but I don’t hate them as much as I did. Idly, I wondered if the Dragonfly could tell that it had bloomed. He hadn’t known when it’d been incinerated, so probably not.

Not long after I’d finished eating breakfast, my phone buzzed. I stared at the vaguely familiar 717 number on the screen. Was this Gretna Pest Control again? “Hello?” I answered.

“Hi, this is the woman who made an inquiry about wood maidens a few weeks ago?” A woman asked.

“Yes it is,” I said, trying to not get my hopes up that she’d found something.

“I’d really appreciate it if you’d tell me what the Hell you know.” Anger tinged her voice.

“Uhh, next to nothing. That’s why I called you.” Why did she sound so peeved?

She sighed heavily. “Any information you have could be helpful. We think we might have found another wood maiden, but there’s been instances of children going missing for days at a time over the last few months. If you know something…”

Ah, okay. Disappearing children is definitely cause for alarm, but it could be any number of Neighbors. Surely it couldn’t be *my* wood maiden. She’d been so kind and gentle. I never once thought she’d prevent me from going home, nor did I hear about any kids going missing from my neighborhood. “I… it’s really not much.”

“Please,” she said. A scuffing sound came from the other end of the line as she moved her phone. “We keep getting calls from scared and angry parents. If we can’t figure out why she’s doing this and stop her, someone’s going to get a chainsaw. I don’t want to see another wood maiden die.” Her irritation at feeling like I’d been keeping something from her shifted to frustration and worry.

“You know where she is?” I whispered.

Jewel landed on the table next to my empty plate to listen in on the conversation. She pulled a tiny utensil from a pocket and used it to scoop up some of the leftover syrup from my French toast.

“We do,” she said slowly. “But if you know something that will help us de-escalate, I need you to tell me.”

“*If* it’s the wood maiden I’m seeking,” I started. “And based on what you said about  missing children, I’m not so sure it is, she died a little over two years ago. I didn’t know someone had replanted her until the start of last month.”

“I see. And why is it you’re seeking her?”

I hesitated. Would it be wise to tell this woman I owed the wood maiden a debt? She seemed nice enough, and it might make her more inclined to help me. Then again, I didn’t know this woman whatsoever, and she could very well hold or use it against me.

“She’s an old friend of mine, and I would like to see her again.”

There was a moment of silence as the woman from Gretna Pest Control contemplated. “If you stop by our office on Wednesday, I can show you roughly where she is. We haven’t been able to pinpoint her tree yet, though.”

*Shit.* No car, *and* I would need to get permission to leave the county. “I’ll have to get back to you on that. Not sure if my supervisor will let me off on such short notice.”

“Alright, well when you figure out a day to come in, give me a call. We’ll work something out,” she said.

“I will. I appreciate you calling me back, and your respect of the situation. The world needs more pest specialists like you.”

“Yeah, yeah, don’t get sappy on me. This situation is far from over. I just hope this wood maiden is yours, and you can talk her down.”

“Assuming she’s even the one responsible for disappearing children,” I reminded her.

We said goodbye and hung up. I looked at Jewel, tears brimming in my eyes.

The pixie flew up to sit on my head and stroke my hair. “You need a car,” she said.

I refrained from nodding, not wanting to dislodge her. Her hands combing through my hair eased some of the tension from me.

“Don’t I know it,” I said.

I’ve been searching for a beater car I might be able to afford, mostly scouring Craigslist and the local classifieds. So far, no luck. There was one I’d thought about getting, a little Subaru the owner only wanted $800 for. But it looked *rough*. And while I did know a really good Mechanic, he’d probably ask for something I’m not willing to give in exchange for repairing whatever might need fixed.

This *probably* says a lot about the kind of person I’ve turned into, but I did briefly consider acquiring a car in the same manner I got this cabin. That is to say, from a dead man. A change in renter is believable. But me driving a car around that’s recognizable as belonging to someone that went missing… not so easily explained.

Sarah’s been a big help since I lost my car. She knows it got totalled in an accident, but I didn’t give her details, of course. I thought about messaging her and asking for a ride into town. She’s picked me up to get groceries a couple times, and has also dropped off a few sewing jobs for people around town. I don’t want to take advantage of her generosity, though, not to mention she’d insist on dropping me off exactly where I needed. That place being Darner’s Auto, and I didn’t need her trying to make any connections there.

The alternative, however, was walking into town. And it’s been fucking *cold* pretty much everywhere in the US right now. I’m talking highs of 13°F (that’s about -10°C for those of you reading from elsewhere in the world). I’ve had to leave my sink on a constant drip so the pipes don’t freeze, and if you’ve never had to do that, just know that the constant sound gets annoying pretty quick.

This cold has been quite a hindrance for doing tasks set by the Huntsman, too. And of course, my lack of singing ability right now makes it trickier to lure people into following me. I have to rely on layering my voice with intention. It’s hard to describe how I do this, because I don’t fully understand it, but basically I speak to someone as if I expect them to do as I say. Full eye contact makes it easier, but some people are more resistant than others.

Thankfully, the Huntsman has only asked me to bring him a couple of people since the Snow People ate my car. I’m sure he recognizes that I’m too stubborn to ask for transportation assistance, and I’d perish from hypothermia before asking him to give me a lift. The thought that he’s thinking of me in that regard is comforting. Not because I think he’s being kind, but because it indicates he thinks I’m more useful as a human than a crow. I’ll take my wins where I can get them.

The last victim delivery was just a few days before my rose bloomed, and to be honest, I wasn’t ready to be trudging through the cold and snow again. So messaging Sarah it was.

*Hey, has Mrs. Mullins said anything more to you about curtains for spring?* I’d done work for Mrs. Mullins several times before, and the elderly woman seemed fond of me. 

While I waited for a response, I raised the hem on a few pairs of pants another resident had left me with. All these little tasks don’t bring in much, but it’s enough to keep the heat on.

Sarah messaged me a few hours later, saying that Mrs. Mullins hadn’t said anything about it in a while, but she had a few other things people had given her for me to work on and would I like to get lunch tomorrow?

Which is what I’d been hoping she’d say. It was the help I needed without having to ask for it. That probably sounds like an odd way of thinking, and to be honest, I’m not sure why my brain’s been working that way. It’s weird, but it somehow feels more ‘right’ to influence someone into getting what I want, rather than asking for a favor that might require something in return.

… I should probably unpack that at some point. It’s not the way I used to think. But I have a wood maiden to find, so it’s gonna have to wait.

  


Sarah picked me up at eleven the next day. When we got to Dillon’s, we settled into one of the window booths. Once the waitress had brought our drinks, I asked, “Is there any way I might be able to borrow your car for a day? I’m trying to set up an appointment a ways east, but can’t commit without transportation.”

As she dumped creamer into her coffee, she gave me a regretful look. “Sorry, Rey, but with all the shifts I’ve been working, and Jake having trouble at school, I can’t not have my car available.”

“No worries,” I said, holding up a hand. “I didn’t think you’d say yes, but figured it couldn’t hurt to ask.”

Her head tilted to the side as she thought. “You know, I don’t think Mrs. Mullins uses her car much anymore. You could ask her.”

“I don’t think I have her number. Do you?”

“Mm, no. But I’ll stop by her house and ask her for you,” she said. “I go over on Thursdays to help her clean her house.”

“I would appreciate that.” I smiled at her, relieved that my transportation issue might be resolved temporarily. Now I just had to get the Mechanic’s approval to leave the county.

I took a warming sip of tea. “Oh, didn’t you say you had something you wanted to ask me, too?”

“Yes,” she said. “I have a… friend who needs a place to stay for a few days. She can’t stay at my house, unfortunately, and I was wondering if you’d be willing to let her crash on your couch for a bit.”

Her demeanor had changed, becoming secretive. I wondered who this other woman was. It wasn’t like Sarah to not be forthcoming with all the details you didn’t need to know. Then I remembered what she’d said to me when she saw the bruises the Mechanic had left on my neck that one time. Suddenly I understood that Sarah wanted my help getting an abuse victim away from their abuser.

I bit my lip and shook my head. “I can’t. Having someone stay at my house would be… unwise.” If I was right in my assumption, whoever she wanted to stay at my house would be in a really fragile state, and therefore easy prey for the Hunt.

Sarah’s expression shifted, and she looked at me with pity. “Right. Because of that guy you won’t leave?”

It took me a second to remember that she thought *I* was in an abusive relationship. Well, I guess I kind of am, but not in the way she thinks, not exactly. I sighed, averting my gaze to the salt-stained parking lot.

She reached across the table and laid her hand across mine. “I wish you’d drop him. Find yourself someone nice. Like Mr. Darner!” Her eyes glanced behind me as she whispered excitedly.

Gods, was he here?

Brows furrowed, I glanced over my shoulder to where her eyes had gone. Sure enough, he sat at the counter chatting with one of the other locals. Great. How had I not noticed him when we walked in?

It wasn’t hard to play-up being flustered. Heat crept up my face as I turned back to Sarah. Withdrawing my hand from hers, I said, “Oh, no. Someone like him wouldn’t have that kind of interest in me.”

She frowned. “Why not? I’m pretty sure he’s single, and he’d be a *Hell* of a catch for anyone. He’s handsome, runs a small business, is well-liked by the community.” Her gaze flicked back and forth between me and him. “And you’re almost as much of a sweetheart as he is. I bet yinz would make a cute couple.”

I choked on my drink. “Look, I appreciate that you think so fondly of me, but that’s not–”

“Howdy, ladies! Mind if I join ya?”

With only a slight hesitation, I slid further into the booth to make room. Sarah beamed.

“Hi, Mr. Darner,” she said. “Rey and I were just talking about you, weren’t we Rey?”

Part of me wanted to melt into the vinyl of the seat. Another part had a morbid curiosity for where this was going to go.

“Were ya now?” the Huntsman drawled. He turned his head to grin at me.

“We were,” I said before pretending to take a sip of my tea so I could mutter into my cup. “Whatever you’re about to do, please don’t.”

As expected, he ignored me.

“What about me?”

Sarah smiled. “Well, we were wondering, *Rey* was wondering, if you’re doing anything next Saturday.”

Next Saturday being Valentine’s Day. She’s lucky I actually had been wondering if he had plans, or he would probably have gotten irritated by her lie. Which was unlucky for me, I guess, because now he knew I *had* been thinking about it.

The Huntsman smiled like a cat about to catch a mouse. “What, for Valentine’s Day? Can’t rightly say I have plans,” he said.

Under the table, Sarah nudged my foot with hers. She stared intently at me.

I stared back, only saying, “A handsome young man like yourself? Seems surprising.”

Sarah gave me a light kick. I wasn’t going to cave to her peer pressure, though, much as I might want to. My heart hurts enough already with all the fucking pining I do; no need to make it worse by getting directly and publicly shot down.

“I understand, though,” I said. “I don’t put much stock in Hallmark holidays myself.”

Sarah was trying really hard to not roll her eyes in frustration, I could tell. “Sounds like you two would get along well, then.”

The Dragonfly smiled beatifically and side-eyed me. “Oh, I dunno. This one seems like she’s got a stubborn streak as wide as the Mississippi. Looks like the chatty type, too.”

A tense smile curved my lips. I’ve been *damn* quiet since New Year’s, for obvious reasons. If he couldn’t appreciate that, I’d make an effort to go back to talking to myself all the time. “I’ve spent a great deal of time in quiet contemplation recently, actually,” I said. “You’re right about the stubbornness though. I’m sure you’d find me generally insufferable.”

Sarah sighed and slumped in her seat, seeming to have given up on her matchmaking for now. She didn’t notice the Huntsman narrow his eyes at my implied threat.

She perked back up when the waitress brought her soup. After dumping a packet of crushed crackers into the thick, red fluid, she glanced up at me, then at the Dragonfly. “Did yinz hear Patty’s boyfriend got arrested?” There was the Sarah I knew and appreciated: the Gossip Queen of Prospect.

I raised my eyebrows, feigning ignorance. “Who?”

The Huntsman emptied five sugar packets into the fresh coffee the waitress had put in front of him. “They pick him up at Heaver’s?” he asked. “Was wonderin’ what all that hubbub was about the other day.”

Sarah nodded. “I’m a little surprised authorities waited so long to take him in. She’s been gone for, what? Almost two months now?”

“Oh, *her,*” I said. “They ever figure out what happened?”

After eating a spoonful of her tomato soup, she shook her head. “Nope. Never found her body. If you ask me,” she said, leaning forward and lowering her voice, “I think he killed her on the way home.”

“You really think so?” I asked.

“Mmhm.” She took another spoonful of soup, then gestured with her spoon. “They had a fight at the bar the night she disappeared, right? Then left together, like they always do. That was just their thing; they’d fight, go home and be even more shitty to each other, then make up. Only this time, they didn’t make up. I think she did something that made him almost crash the car. There was an awfully big dent in it the day after. He snapped and killed her, then dumped the body.”

I’m sure I’m not the only one Sarah has relayed this theory to. Given that Patty’s ex was in jail, this small-town recrimination had reached the police, and they’d found enough evidence to arrest him.

Exactly as I’d told Patty would happen.

Someone’s phone buzzed, and Sarah reached into her pocket. She fished out her phone and glanced at the screen before answering.

“Hey, sweetie. Everything okay?”

I couldn’t hear what the other person said, but Sarah’s eyes darkened.

“Alright, I’ll be there as soon as I can. I have to take a friend home first, but I’ll be right there afterwards. You sit tight.” After hanging up, she looked at me, apologetic. “Hey, Rey, I’m sorry, but I gotta cut our lunch short and take you home now. Jake is having an issue at school, and I need to go pick him up.”

I started winding my scarf around my neck, but the Huntsman’s words made me pause. “Why don’t you go ahead and take care o’ your kid,” he said to Sarah. “I can take Rey home for ya.”

“Oh, I couldn’t impose,” I said at the same time Sarah said, “Are you sure, Mr. Darner?”

“Be no trouble at all,” the Huntsman said, giving me a deceptive grin.

Sarah gave him a thankful smile. “I’ll have to get you a coffee the next time I see you.” She left some money on the table for her lunch and hurried off.

I sighed, staring at the empty space across from me. “I did need to talk to you, actually.”

“‘Bout your wood maiden?” He sipped his coffee, then reached past me for more sugar packets.

“Yeah.” I idly swirled the remaining tea in my cup. “There’s a pest control company I contacted. They think they found her.”

“You mean they found *a* wood maiden. Don’t mean it’s yours.”

“I know,” I said. “And truth be told, I’m not sure this is her. But I’d be remiss if I didn’t go check.”

“True.”

We fell to silence for a few moments. My thoughts remained on my wood maiden. Was it really her? If it was, did she have anything to do with–

“So you were wonderin’ what I’d be doin’ on Valentine’s Day.”

Welp, I knew this teasing was coming. “Valentine’s Day has a rather violent history, if I recall correctly. Stands to reason I might wonder how someone who enjoys a bit of casual murder and maiming might celebrate.”

He snorted. “I’m sure that’s exactly what you were wonderin’. Who I might be takin’ my knife to, or whose throat I’d wrap my fingers around.”

Heat crept over my face, but not from my tea. “Can we please not have this conversation here?”

“Sure,” he said with a laugh. “Would you rather have it at your place? Or mine?”

“Why are you like this?” I asked as I signaled to the waitress for the check.

“‘Cause it makes me so endearing.” He smirked.

I rolled my eyes and waved him out of the booth. Snagging the order paper and the money Sarah had left, I took them up to the register.

A blast of cold air hit us as we left the diner. I tugged my scarf tighter. He pulled his hood up and stuffed his hands in his pockets. “Colder than a witch’s tit out here,” he grumbled.

“Yeah, it’s a little chilly out,” I agreed.

He shook his head as we got in the truck. “A ‘little chilly’? What, this ain’t cold enough for you?”

Air blasted from the vents as soon as he turned the key. I flicked the toggle to the side to wait for the air to grow warm. “Oh, it’s plenty cold enough. I just tolerate it better than you do.”

Hand hovering above the shifter, he side-eyed me. “I ain’t opposed to makin’ you ride in the back.”

“That’s illegal in the state of PA,” I said matter-of-factly.

“*Now* you’re concerned about doin’ illegal shit?” He put the truck into gear and started off.

“Yes. Kidnapping and murder is fine. I draw the line at riding in the back of a truck. But back to my wood maiden, I would like permission to leave the county for a day so I can see if these people actually found her.”

“How you plannin’ on gettin’ there? You gonna walk all the way to, where is it? Philadelphia?”

“Not quite that far,” I said. “And Sarah said she’d ask Mrs. Mullins for me if I could borrow her car.”

“Hmph. And what are you gonna have to do in exchange for all these favors?”

I shrugged. “No one’s asked for anything yet, but I’m sure Mrs. Mullins wouldn’t ask for more than a little bit of sewing. Maybe some help gardening come spring. Sarah might ask me to lower the hem on some of her son’s pants, since he had another growth spurt. Nothing crazy or time-consuming.”

He didn’t respond, appearing to be considering. What, I wasn’t sure.

When he still hadn’t said anything after a moment, I asked, “So may I be granted permission to leave the county for a day to verify whether or not this is my wood maiden?”

A grin slowly spread across his face. “Sure. We can go next Friday. That work for ya?”

I swear I heard a record scratch in my mind. *We?*

“Umm, what do you mean, ‘we’?”

“I think that’s pretty obvious, Mel. I’ll drive us out to wherever this pest control company is, and you can see ‘bout your wood maiden.”

“I’m not sure why you’d want to trouble yourself. It’s almost five hours one way.”

“See, someone’s gotta keep an eye on you,” he said, glancing at me. “I gotta admit, though. I’m curious as to what all the fuss is about. A wood maiden kidnappin’ children? That sounds excitin’!”

“I really don’t think it’s her,” I muttered. “The wood maiden I knew wouldn’t have taken children unless she thought they were being hurt.”

“Ain’t quite your wood maiden anymore, though, is she?” he said. “She’ll have gone through a fair bit of trauma, I reckon. Might have changed her.”

I thought about what Gwyn ap Nudd had made me experience on Yule. Much as I didn’t want to acknowledge it, the Huntsman might have a point.

He pulled into my driveway, the tires of the truck crunching over the leftover snow. To my surprise, he turned the truck off.

Hand on the doorhandle, I looked him over. “You planning on staying?”

“Been a while since I checked in on your rose. Thought I’d come take a look,” he said.

Though my heart still hurt thinking about what my wood maiden had likely gone through, I couldn’t help a small smile. “Well, come on in, then. Maybe you can stop being mad at me for incinerating it.”

He laughed as we got out and headed inside. “That right?”

Kicking my boots off at the door, I gestured toward the vase on the table. “See for yourself.”

He politely removed his own boots before moving to the table. A low whistle blew from him as he picked up my newly bloomed rose. “Well I’ll be.”

I strode up to him, smirking. “You doubted I could do this.”

“No, just didn’t think you’d manage it this quick.” He bopped me on the nose with the flower. The sweet scent invaded my senses.

Scowling, I tried to snatch the rose from him. He let me take it long enough to get my fingers around it, then covered my hand with his and squeezed. I inhaled sharply as the thorns sank into my palm. Glaring at him only invited the whirling presence of his mind into mine.

I didn’t resist as he removed my hand from the rose stem and gently laid my palm on top of the bloom. Blood stained the peachy petals.

He held the rose up between us, grinning. Twirling it around, he inspected it. “Let’s see how fast you can turn this one.”

I tried to pull my hand away so I could get a towel from the kitchen, but he held fast to my wrist. I sighed, but said nothing, knowing he wouldn’t let me go until he wanted to.

The rose clinked softly as he placed it back in the vase. Then he turned my palm face up. Blood seeped from tiny lacerations across my skin.

My eyes rose from my hand to his face. “Are you quite done?” I asked.

He smirked, raising my forefinger to smear a line down my cheek before releasing me. “For now.”

I retreated to the kitchen to wash my hand and wipe the blood from my face, then grabbed a towel to stop any lingering bleeding. The cuts weren’t enough to warrant bandaids, thankfully, but they would likely make sewing uncomfortable for a day or two.

The Dragonfly didn’t stay for long, just long enough to tell me when he’d be picking me up next week, and hash out other travel details.

When he left, I messaged Sarah to let her know she didn’t need to bug Mrs. Mullins about borrowing her car, that I’d found a ride.

I rolled my eyes when I read her response.

I posted recently about a draft email I was thinking of sending to uBPD mom. I edited the email a bit from what was posted and sent it. I got this response from her a couple days later:

""Somehow, Some way, Some day soon, you and I have to meet in person and talk.

I don't want to write in a message how I feel because it seems like my feelings are diminished.

And, I don't want my words to be scrutinized and then taken as an inaccurate context.

Let me know about possibly meeting halfway to a coffee shop or somewhere.

Love, Mom""

  
I do not feel safe meeting her in person, alone, to talk. My husband and therapist both do not advise this either, as she had mentioned meeting me a couple months ago in one of her emails (that I did not respond to). 

  
My first thought reading this is that again, it's all about her. I told her in the email how we were disturbed, and I discussed that it wasn't appropriate to share details about her mental and physical health with the kids, among other things. I also think she didn't like what I said about having to protect my daughter (of course). She refuses to acknowledge any hurt, and instead, says she doesn't want her words to be ""scrutinized"" and taken as ""inaccurate."" So, she is basically accusing me (and maybe my daughter and husband) of the one who twists words (when she does that). More projection and gaslighting. 

In addition, I live a 2 hour drive away from her. Both my husband and work full-time, and the next couple months are extremely busy for us. Our teenage kids are busy every weekend, often needing to go in opposite directions so we have to transport them to activities. The level of things we need to do on a weekly basis is something she doesn't seem to understand. When I would share this with her in the past, she would go on and on about how she was a single parent. I am an only child, and although I know she had some difficulties, we had tons of family members closeby and I was often at an aunt or uncle's house, at my grandparents, or hanging out with my best friend who lived next door. She had the type of support I could only imagine having.

Of course, I didn't have expectations but it seems she is intent on this meeting in person thing. I am not willing to do this. 

Have any of you been in this position before, where you are not sure about staying NC forever, but you're not even sure about VLC and not willing to uphold their terms?

Since then it’s been a journey of trying to figure things out. To which a potential problem has popped up…

The scale.    

Yesterday I made the best tasting mocha I’ve ever had. Seems I’m finally narrowing things down on the grind. 16 in…34 out, 30 seconds. Close enough. 

I turned the grind 1/2 step finer. Then this morning, anticipating deliciousness, went thru the prep ritual. Started the shot but…

Man was it going slow. Really slow. Could 1/2 of a grind step really make \*that\* much difference?!?    

No, I’m not really going that much off of time I’m trying to judge more by weight and taste. But…by 60 seconds I’d reached 28 grams and something was off. So I shut it down, took the cup and scale off and eyeballed it suspiciously. That looks like…a lot. So I took the scale off and weighed it….    

Something tells me you’re not supposed to have 128 g of espresso. I think I just set the record for the world’s most over extracted coffee.  

Bad news is that it’s set a New World record for bitterness, good news is that with enough milk and chocolate I was able to get it down and I’m sure the taste will last me the rest of the day. 😖     

But, something is seriously off with my scale and I suspect I know what it is.  The Lagato platform is small. Unusually small, and I suspect that the scale is being hung up on the sides of my Coffee worship altar. The scale is a Maestri House Mini. It’s supposed to be small, but I have a suspicion that I’m getting a lot of inaccuracies which might explain why my espresso has been all over the place.    

So, to those with a Turin Lagato V2… what scale are you using that fits?

Unfortunately, she’s one of those girls who, when she’s in a relationship, puts her boyfriend first and abandons her friends until they break up. Obviously, she only remembers us when she has a problem she wants to talk about, and she doesn’t give the same energy to our problems. Of course, I knew this would eventually ruin our friendship, but she usually tried to fix it, so I felt reassured.

Recently, she got pregnant and is preparing to get married. For the past five months, the only thing we talk about is her pregnancy, her symptoms, and her wedding. For five months now, she hasn’t even asked what’s going on in my life. Every day it’s pregnancy reels, babies. Something that doesn’t concern me at all, since I don’t plan to become a mother anytime soon. At first, I understood that she needed to talk about it and I was incredibly supportive, but I’ve started to get tired. I explained to her very politely that it can’t be the only thing we talk about—pregnancy reels.

She apologized a hundred times but said she feels dizzy and doesn’t have the energy to see or talk to anyone. I should note that she works normally every day and also goes to university, so it’s not like she stays home and doesn’t socialize. She’s only “not okay” when it comes to seeing me. At first, I thought she was just avoiding me because she was focusing on her fiancé. However, she accused me of neglecting her. She calls me everyday to share her news! I always ask her if she needs something from me to bring her, or if she wants to hang out in her place or go for a coffee. The answer is always “I’m dizzy, can’t hang out”.

The cherry on top came two weeks ago. She told me to go to her place to hang out. I drove 40 minutes to get there, and as soon as I arrived, because her fiancé got off work, they sent me away because they had planned to go shopping!!! As I was leaving, she remembered to ask me how I was doing, and I told her that there were many things tha happened and I didn’t have time to tell her at the door. She said we would talk about it tomorrow. Of course, she never asked again, and two weeks have passed.

On the one hand, I feel sorry for her because she has no friends besides me. But on the other hand, I see it selfishly and I don’t think I have any obligation to be there for her when she isn’t there for me and never supports me. When she’s without a partner, she is a very good friend.

1qvu7t1,https://drbrc.in/treatments/male-libido,Best Male Libido Treatment n Testosterone Boost Naturally,"# The Silent Crisis of Masculinity: Beyond ""Just Aging""

Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD), commonly known as low libido, is often dismissed by modern medicine as a psychological issue or an inevitable consequence of aging. This is a dangerous oversimplification that ignores the root physiological collapse occurring in modern men. 

Q. Can male libido be enhanced naturally?

Ans. At Dr BRC clinic they **enhance male libido naturally**.  Take appointment at drbrc .in and **boost male libido naturally**. 

  


Q. Can testosterone be boosted naturally?

Ans. Dr BRC clinic can help you boost your testosterone in natural way. Thus you can resort to their site drbrc .in , take treatment and **boost testosterone naturally**.

At Dr BRC Clinic, they recognize low libido as a **systemic biological alarm signal**. It is rarely an isolated symptom; rather, it is the ""canary in the coal mine"" for deteriorating cardiovascular health, metabolic chaos, and hormonal collapse.

In India, we are witnessing a precipitous decline in male vitality. Studies indicate that the average testosterone levels of Indian men have dropped by nearly 25% in the last two decades. This is not due to genetic changes-evolution does not happen that fast. It is purely environmental and lifestyle-driven. High stress levels in urban centers like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore, combined with a diet rich in refined carbohydrates and industrial seed oils, create a ""perfect storm"" for hormonal suppression.

When a man loses his drive, it indicates that his body has shifted into a ""survival mode"" where reproduction and vitality are deprioritized to conserve energy for basic organ function. This shift is driven by chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and a diet that clogs the micro-vessels essential for hormonal transport. The conventional approach of prescribing sildenafil (Viagra) or testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) addresses the symptom but ignores the rotting foundation. Adding synthetic hormones to a body that cannot metabolize them correctly often leads to severe side effects, including testicular atrophy, polycythemia (thick blood), and increased cardiovascular risk.

Our clinical data, derived from treating thousands of patients across India, reveals a startling correlation: men with low libido are statistically far more likely to develop Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension within 5 years. This is because the same endothelial dysfunction that prevents blood flow to the sexual organs also restricts blood flow to the heart and pancreas.

The **Dr BRC Clinic Restoration Protocol** is not about temporary stimulation. It is a rigorous, science-backed reconstruction of your metabolic health. By utilizing Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury's Nobel Prize-aligned science of Circadian Rhythm and the DIP Diet, we do not just ""boost"" libido—we repair the cellular machinery that produces it. This is about reclaiming the biological right to vitality, strength, and drive, regardless of your chronological age. We move beyond the ""pill for every ill"" mentality and address the core biological environment.



# The Dr BRC Clinic Restoration Methodology: A 3-Pillar Approach

Our treatment protocol is not a collection of ""tips."" It is a rigid, clinically validated framework developed by Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury. It leverages the body's innate intelligence to heal when interference is removed. The protocol relies on three non-negotiable pillars: **Nutritional Biochemistry (DIP Diet)**, **Electromagnetic Grounding (Zero Volt)**, and **Circadian Synchronization**.

# Pillar 1: The DIP Diet (Direct Intervention Protocol)

The DIP Diet is designed to lower insulin load and maximize antioxidant intake. For libido restoration, it works by clearing the ""sludge"" from the blood—excess sugar, triglycerides, and uric acid—that blocks micro-circulation.

* 1 **Step 1: The Fruit Fast (Morning)**Until 12:00 PM, you consume ONLY fruits. Any 3-4 types of seasonal fruits (Mango, Banana, Grapes, Citrus). No tea, no coffee, no parathas. *Why?* Fruits are ""living water."" Unlike tap water, the water inside fruits is structured (H3O2) and rich in electrolytes. This hydrates the cells more effectively than any beverage. It flushes out toxins accumulated overnight and provides the purest form of fructose to power the liver without spiking insulin. This morning window is crucial for lowering oxidative stress.
* 2 **Step 2: The Raw Plate Principle (Lunch & Dinner)**Before every cooked meal, you must eat a plate of raw vegetables (Cucumber, Tomato, Radish, Carrot) equal to your body weight × 5 (in grams). *Why?* The raw vegetables provide the ""nitric oxide precursors"" (nitrates) essential for blood flow. They also create a fiber matrix that prevents sugar spikes from the cooked food that follows. This ensures that your insulin levels stay low, preventing the aromatization of testosterone.
* 3 **Step 3: Elimination of VIP Foods**Zero animal protein (meat, dairy, eggs) and zero industrial products (packaged food, refined oil). *Why?* Animal protein mimics the amino acid structure of our own tissues, causing ""Molecular Mimicry"" and autoimmune inflammation. Dairy is laden with mammalian estrogen, which directly suppresses male testosterone. Avoiding these foods stops the fire of inflammation.

# Pillar 2: Zero Volt Therapy (Earthing)

The human body is bio-electrical. Inflammation is essentially a surplus of positively charged protons. The Earth is an infinite reservoir of negatively charged electrons.

By connecting your body to the earth (either walking barefoot on grass or using our patented Zero Volt bedsheets), you allow electrons to flow into your body and neutralize free radicals. For libido, this is transformative because it drastically lowers **Cortisol**. As mentioned in the mechanism section, lowering cortisol is the only way to ""unlock"" the production of Testosterone.

This is the fastest way to switch the body from ""Fight or Flight"" (Sympathetic) to ""Rest and Digest"" (Parasympathetic), which is the state required for sexual arousal.

# Pillar 3: Circadian Heat Shock

Testosterone production follows a circadian rhythm, peaking in the early morning. We optimize this by prescribing specific sun exposure and hot water immersion therapies (Lower Leg Hot Water Immersion) to stimulate Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs). These proteins repair damaged endothelial cells and improve vascular elasticity, allowing for stronger, sustained erections and drive. It is a form of passive cardiovascular exercise that strengthens the heart without stressing the joints.

1qvu77g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qvu77g,"Family Vacation Without Me? Say Goodbye to Your Home, Hubby!","Three years. Three years I watched my husband pack his bags and fly his entire family—mom, dad, siblings, the whole damn circus—to Australia for New Year's.


Me? I got the same line every single time.


""Flights are expensive, Genevieve. Someone's gotta stay and watch the house.""


So I did. Like an idiot. For three years straight.


But this year? This year, I didn't argue. Didn't cry. Didn't even blink.


I just smiled real sweet, waved them off at the door, and waited.


The second their car turned the corner, I was on the phone with my realtor.


""List it. Today.""


Two weeks later, my darling husband came home from his little family vacay, dragging his suitcase up the driveway like he owned the place.


Spoiler alert: he didn't.


He froze at the front door.


New locks. Two massive dudes sitting on my couch, feet up, looking real comfortable.


Then came the calls. The texts. The voicemails. Frantic.


I let him sweat for a minute. Then I sent one text back:


""House? SOLD. Marriage? OVER. You and your precious family can figure out where to crash together. Good luck with that!""


---


Ronan Prescott stood the last suitcase up by the front door.


""Genevieve,"" he said, ""it's the same deal as last year.""


I stopped wiping the coffee table.


And just stared at him.


I looked at his mom, Sharon, and his dad, Robert, hovering behind him.


I looked at his sister, Tiffany, and her husband, Kevin.


And their kid, Gabriel, clutching his parents' hands.


The whole squad. All six of them.


They were heading to Australia.


For the third year in a row.


For the New Year's break.


""Flights are insane right now, and honestly, you'd just be bored anyway,"" Ronan said, the words falling off his tongue like a practiced script.


""Besides, someone's gotta watch the place,"" Sharon chimed in, not even bothering to look at me while she dug through her purse.


""Yeah, Genevieve, we'll be back before you know it!"" Tiffany added with that fake-ass innocent smile.


Same lines for three years.


Not a single word changed.


Year one, I cried my eyes out.


Year two, I screamed my head off.


But this year?


I just smiled.


""Fine,"" I said.


One word. That's it.


Ronan blinked, totally caught off guard by how chill I was being.


He'd probably spent all morning rehearsing his excuses.


Ready to shut down my questions, my tears, and my ""hysterical"" outbursts.


Now, he had nothing to fight against.


A flicker of awkwardness crossed his face.


""Well... okay then. Take care of things here. Call if you need anything.""


""Mhm.""


""You need some cash?""


""I'm good.""


""Alright. We're heading out.""


He grabbed the handle of his suitcase.


The whole clan swarmed out the door.


The front door slammed shut with a heavy thud.


The world finally went quiet.


Sharon's cheap perfume was still lingering in the air.


A few half-finished glasses of water were still sweating on the table.


I stood there, taking it all in.


For a long, long time.


Then, I pulled out my phone.


And found a contact I'd saved a week ago.


""Sal, it's Genevieve. You ready?""


The background noise on his end was loud.


""Genevieve! Hey! You finally making the move?""


""I'm in,"" I said.


""The house. List it. Now.""


""You got it! I'll bring some buyers over ASAP. I'm gonna get you a killer price, I promise!""


""Don't bother with the top price.""


I walked to the window and watched the airport shuttle pull away from the curb.


""Sal, I want this done fast. Like, yesterday fast.""


""List it ten percent below market value for an all-cash deal.""


The line went dead silent for a second.


""Whoa, you sure? That's a massive chunk of change you're leaving on the table.""


""I'm positive.""


""Sell it. Now.""


I hung up.


Tossed the phone onto the cushions.


And walked into the bedroom.


I opened the closet and pulled out my own suitcase.


The same red one I'd rolled in here with three years ago.


Now, it was leaving with me.


I'm done with this house.


And I'm damn sure done with this ""husband.""


They love doing everything together as a family?


Fine. I'll give them exactly what they want.


I folded my clothes, one by one, and packed them away.


I took my time.


It felt like a ritual.


A final goodbye to three years of being a doormat.


I didn't have much.


Everything I cared about fit into one bag.


Finally, I reached into the back of the nightstand and pulled out a leather folder.


The deed to the house.


Only my name was on it.


The one bit of leverage my parents made sure I had.


I tucked it into my jacket pocket.


Zipped the suitcase shut.


I stood up and took one last look around.


I chose those curtains. I picked those sheets.


Our wedding photo was still staring back at me from the wall.


Ronan looked so ""tender"" in that shot.


And I looked so ""happy.""


What a joke!


I walked over, ripped the frame off the wall.


And slammed it onto the floor.


The glass shattered into a million pieces.


That was the most satisfying sound I'd heard in this house in three years!


I grabbed my bag and walked out.


I didn't look back.


My phone buzzed.


It was Sal.


""Genevieve, I'm downstairs. I've got two serious buyers with me. Both all-cash, ready to close.""


""Come on up,"" I said. ""Door's open.""


Chapter 2


Sal showed up with two guys in tow.


One was a middle-aged guy with a beer gut and a thick gold chain.


The other was younger, looking sharp with a buzz cut and a full tattoo sleeve.


""Genevieve, meet the guys. Both of them are itching to take this place off your hands,"" Sal said, full of energy.


""Mr. Moore, Mr. Jones,"" I nodded. ""Make yourselves at home. Take a look.""


The gold-chain guy, Moore, took a quick lap around the place.


""Nice reno, great neighborhood. But...""


He glanced at the shattered glass on the floor.


""Rough morning?""


""Nope,"" I said. ""Divorce.""


Moore and Sal both froze for a second.


The younger guy, Jones, actually smirked.


""Damn,"" he said. ""I like your style.""


""I prefer doing business with people who don't play games.""


He didn't even bother looking at the rest of the rooms. He just walked right up to me.


""I'll take the deal Sal mentioned.""


""Ten percent under market, all cash, we sign the papers today.""


Sal stammered, ""Wait, Jones... Mr. Moore hasn't even—""


Moore just waved a hand. ""Nah, I'm out. I don't need the drama.""


He turned and walked out the door.


Sal looked a little awkward.


Jones didn't care at all.


He locked eyes with me. ""So, we got a deal or what?""


My mind went back to three years ago.


The very first time Ronan and I got into it in this house.


It was because his mother insisted she had to have the master bedroom because it got the best sunlight.


Even though that was supposed to be our room.


Ronan told me to just give it up.


""Genevieve, come on, she's my mom,"" he'd said. ""Just show some respect, okay?""


I told him no.


It was my house. My parents paid for it.


That was the first time I saw that cold, nasty look on his face.


""Why do you have to be so difficult?""


In the end, I folded.


We moved into the small, chilly guest room.


I thought playing nice would buy me some peace.


Instead, it just gave them permission to walk all over me.


They treated me like an appliance that came with the house.


Like furniture they could just move around whenever it suited them.


Well, today I was resetting the whole damn house.


""We have a deal,"" I told Jones. ""Let's go to the office and sign the papers right now.""


Jones's eyes lit up. ""Hell yeah! Consider it sold!""


Sal snapped out of it, beaming. ""Great! Let's get this show on the road!""


Everything went fast. Like, scary fast.


By 4 PM, we were sitting in the conference room at the agency.


Jones had his lawyer with him.


I'd called my best friend, Maya, who's a shark of an attorney.


Maya looked at me like I'd lost my mind when I first called.


She thought I was having some kind of breakdown.


""Genevieve, are you 100% sure about this?""


""I've never been more sober in my life.""


Maya stared at me for a long beat.


Then she finally sighed.


""Alright. I'm in.""


""That loser doesn't deserve a dime of your life.""


Maya went through the contract line by line.


Jones's lawyer didn't mess around either.


They hashed out the details in record time.


The total came to five hundred thousand dollars.


Jones cut a check for a two-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar deposit on the spot.


The rest would hit my account the second the title transfer was finished.


Since it was a pre-marital asset and only my name was on the deed, it was a clean break.


No red tape. No complications.


And zero need for Ronan's signature.


We signed the papers and made it official.


Jones had his finance guy wire the money immediately.


My phone buzzed.


A bank alert popped up.


Your account ending in xxxx has received a deposit of $250,000.00.


I stared at the zeros.


I didn't feel anything. No regret, no fear.


Maya grabbed my arm, her face lit up.


""Genevieve! You actually did it!""


I just gave her a weak smile.


Jones stood up and reached across the table.


""Good doing business with you, Genevieve.""


""Likewise,"" I said, shaking his hand.


Then he asked, ""So, can I take possession of the keys now?""


""Be my guest.""


""Here.""


I dropped the heavy keychain on the table.


Ronan's key. Sharon's key. Tiffany's key.


Every single one of their spare keys was on that ring.


And none of them worked for me anymore.


Jones scooped them up.


""Sweet.""


""I'm gonna go get those locks changed right now.""


""Go for it.""


He headed out with his lawyer.


Sal got his commission and was grinning like he'd won the lottery.


Finally, it was just me and Maya left in the room.


She gave me a huge hug. ""It's over, babe.""


""No.""


I leaned my head on her shoulder.


""This is just the beginning.""


I still had one last move to make.


The divorce.


I pulled out my phone and opened the chat with Ronan.


They should be landing in Australia by now.


I started typing a message.


Then I paused and deleted it.


No rush.


I wanted him to come home first.


I wanted to see the look on his face when he stood in front of a door he could no longer open.


I wanted him to know exactly what it felt like to have the rug pulled out from under him.


Maya asked, ""So what now? You gonna find a rental?""


""Yeah.""


""I'll help you look.""


""No, I've got it.""


I wanted to make every single decision on my own.


From here on out.


I booked a room at a nice hotel for the week.


Then I started browsing listings.


I wanted something small. A one-bedroom condo. Just for me.


Somewhere close to the office.


I still had my career.


My life wasn't going to stop just because I cut out some dead weight.


Later that night, Ronan sent a message.


It was a photo.


The bright blue sky and white sand of an Australian beach.


Caption: Hey babe, we're here! Everything's perfect.


Oh, so he actually remembered he had a wife. How touching.


I stared at the picture.


In the corner, I could see Tiffany flashing a peace sign.


And Sharon in her oversized sunglasses, looking like she owned the place.


They looked so damn happy.


Good for them.


I locked my screen.


I really hope you guys enjoy your vacation.


Because when you get back, you're going to be very, very homeless.


Chapter 3


I stayed in that hotel for three days.


That was all the time I needed to snag a new apartment.


It's a fully furnished one-bedroom, totally move-in ready.


And it's only two blocks from my office.


I took a chunk of that house deposit and paid for a whole year's lease upfront.


Maya helped me move in.


Honestly, there wasn't much to pack.


Just one suitcase.


And a cool quarter-million sitting in my bank account.


""Well, look at you, Ms. Moneybags!"" Maya joked.


""It's a start,"" I said.


""Once the rest of the cash clears, I'm looking for a condo downtown.""


""I want a place that's 100% mine.""


""And I am never letting another soul move in.""


Maya looked at me, her voice softening. ""Genevieve, you've really changed.""


""Yeah?""


""You used to be all about 'keeping the peace' and making sure the family was happy.""


I let out a bitter laugh. ""Yeah, well, I used to be a total idiot.""


""I thought if I just kept taking the high road, everything would eventually work out.""


""Turns out, I backed up so far I almost fell off a cliff!""


Three years ago, when we first got married.


Ronan's career was taking off, so I quit my job to be a full-time housewife.


He told me, ""Honey, you've worked so hard. Let me take care of you from now on.""


And like a fool, I believed him.


I spent every day in the kitchen, making him five-star meals.


I treated his parents like they were my own flesh and blood.


I treated his sister like she was my best friend.


I thought I was finally part of the family.


But to them, I was always just an outsider.


Just a tool for the Prescotts to use for housework and eventually, an heir.


Our first New Year's together.


They decided the whole family was going to Miami.


I was so excited, I offered to book the flights and handle the itinerary.


Sharon just brushed me off. ""Oh, Genevieve, you should stay. Who's going to water all the plants if we're all gone?""


Ronan chimed in, ""Yeah, babe, flights are crazy expensive right now. Just think of the money we'll save.""


That was the first time they left me behind for the holidays.


I sat there all alone in that big, empty house.


Watching the fireworks outside my window.


And cried myself to sleep.


The second year, they planned a trip to Hawaii.


Same excuse.


""You stay and hold down the fort.""


That time, I actually stood up for myself and we had a massive blowout.


He got right in my face and started screaming.


""Genevieve, can you stop being so selfish?! My mom's getting older, this might be her last big trip! Can't you just let her be happy for once?!""


""We're a family! Why do you always have to make it about you?!""


""Honestly, you're being a total disappointment.""


That was the first time I saw how ugly he could really be.


The ""sweet guy"" in our wedding photos? Total fake.


It was all an act.


My heart just went cold after that.


This year, it was Australia.


Even further away.


They announced it at the dinner table like it was no big deal.


Tiffany was all smiles, bragging about the great deal she found on tickets.


""Ronan! Mom! We're going to Australia for New Year's!""


They were all cheering and high-fiving.


Not one person asked what I thought.


It was like I was a ghost in my own home.


I put my fork down.


And looked at Ronan.


He couldn't even meet my eyes.


That was it. I was done.


I didn't even want to argue anymore.


There was no point.


I just wanted out.


Clean and permanent.


""Earth to Genevieve? You still with me?"" Maya's voice snapped me back to reality.


""Nothing.""


I hung my last coat in the closet.


""It's all in the past now.""


The new place is small, but it's cozy.


I bought myself a massive bouquet of fresh lilies for the kitchen.


The afternoon sun was streaming in, and for the first time, it felt warm.


Over the next few days, Ronan messaged me every day.


Pics of the Sydney Opera House, selfies on the Gold Coast... the usual.


Every now and then, he'd drop a: Hey babe, what are you up to at home?


I'd reply: Doing great.


He'd ask: Did you eat?


My reply: Yep.


And that was it.


He was just going through the motions.


Checking the ""Good Husband"" box to keep me quiet.


He couldn't even be bothered to actually call me.


Because international roaming is ""too expensive.""


In his world, I wasn't even worth the price of a three-minute phone call.


Pathetic.


A week later, Jones called me.


""Genevieve, the paperwork is all cleared. When can we meet to settle the balance?""


""Whenever works for you.""


""Tomorrow at ten at the bank?""


""See you then.""


The next morning, the other $250,000 hit my account.


Half a million dollars, total. Every single cent.


The first thing I did was wire fifteen thousand to Maya.


""That's for your legal fees,"" I told her.


She almost choked and tried to send it back immediately.


""Are you nuts?! We're friends, Genevieve. I'm not taking your money!""


""You're taking it,"" I insisted.


I sent it again.


""Maya, this isn't just about the money. It's about the principle.""


""I'm closing all my old accounts. I'm settling every debt from my past.""


""Emotional ones, financial ones—all of them.""


""You helped me out, and you deserve to be paid. That's how the world works now.""


Maya went quiet.


A few seconds later, she accepted the transfer.


She texted: Fine, you win. But Genevieve, I'm putting this in a separate account for you. If you ever need it, it's yours. No questions asked.


I looked at the screen and smiled.


That's a real friend.


That's what family feels like.


Not those leeches who bleed you dry while telling you it's ""for your own good.""


One last thing on the to-do list.


I walked into a top-tier law firm downtown.


""Hi, I'd like to speak with someone about filing for divorce.""


The attorney they assigned me was a total pro.


""Of course. Can you give me the background on the situation?""


""My husband has been emotionally abusive for years. He and his family have systematically isolated and ostracized me. I have proof that they've abandoned me at home during every major holiday for the last three years.""


""The house has already been sold. It was a pre-marital asset in my name only, so property division is a non-issue.""


""I don't want anything from him.""


""I just want the papers signed. Immediately.""


The lawyer nodded, taking notes.


""The evidence is solid and the facts are clear. This should be straightforward.""


""We can start drafting the petition right now.""


""Do it.""


""Thanks.""


The sky was incredibly blue when I stepped back outside.


I did the math in my head.


In a couple of days, Ronan and the gang would be landing.


I was actually starting to look forward to it.


I couldn't wait to see the look on his face when he found out he was locked out of his own life.

1qvu5zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Quareia/comments/1qvu5zs/making_candles/,Making candles,"Those I live with often complain that paraphine ones stink. And the fancy coconut ones cost a lot. So I resorted to making my own. Cause it doesn't take too much time when you know what you're doing and is waaay cheaper. Also, I would have lots of leftover wax from candles I've used and it was a shame just to throw it away (if it's dirty you can filter it through old junk cloth or a paper towel and make another candle and use the towel as a fire starter)  
  
In case if someone whants an experience of exploring the topic on their own, you might whant to read it after your own experiments.  
  
I bought some cheap-ass Turkish coffee pot, a candle form, and in my country you can buy soy, palm or coconut wax and it doesn't cost much at all! Though candles from that wax cost a ton. Those are not toxic and white. You also need to have some pot you won't pity. Some children/sculpting clay. Maybe foliage.   
  
I'm currently experimenting with candle wicks, cause regular even natural ones stink, and maybe I'll try to buy some rough cheap wool for knitting and see how it goes. It is a waste of money to buy prepared wicks cause it's literally a string in wax. Also, a wooden wick might not always burn and that might be either cause it is too narrow or cause the wood is not oily, so you kinda need to submerge it in oil, dry it a little and then use it. Wooden wicks are a bit of a pain in the ass, in my experience. I suggest not throwing out those tiny metal things that hold wicks at the bottom of tea candles. Cause you can make candles with some plastic vessels laying around the house, from toothpicks, etc...(you just need to make sure the wax is not too hot) or even re-use the tea candle vessels themselves. So not to buy new ones constantly.   
  
Most tutorials tell you to just hit the table a little with the form, so the air bubbles would surface. And there won't be air inside. From what I've discovered, the most important part is room temperature. Though there are some specialized waxes not prone to holes but that is probably for fancy candle makers. It's best to make candles during warm weather (20-25°c), and wait a while till they cool down completley and slowly, so the tall candles especially won't have holes inside them. My first candles suffered the fate of not being usable cause of holes and my impatience. And in case you're making them during winter in the cold room, you'll need to poke with a needle a little around the wick, and fill them with wax a bit later. In some cases I even scooped out some of the middle to fill it again with wax, and then check again for holes. I saw that some people buy round granulated wax and just pour it into the glass jar, and use it like that, without melting it at all. I haven't tried it, but that method takes even less time, though I resort to solid candles in case travel, etc. I don't know why I suddenly decided to write about it, but I thaught, why not.  
  
Once you find a joy of occasionally making your own cheap-ass fancy shmancy soy/coconut/palm/mixed wax non-toxic eco friendly candles, you cannot go back to the life you had before.

One that would not falter before this imposing figure. To cloak ones self in black cloth, To shield themselves behind obsidian eyes imbedded within a mask of leather. Such things might work on others, Yet before this child all had been revealed. For the boy knew Santa had come once more to prove his place in the Endless Hunt. Neither seeming to have time to spare, to play a game of stare, As the boy had been on a hunt of his own. For all that waited this figure that stepped through the door, had been the ghoulish sounds of this mass of twisted limbs and mutilated flesh. 

Child now made their way through the blinding snow, for every howl would try to drag the boy right back through that broken door. Yet none could stop this boy from finding the old man buried six feet deep. Left peering down from the edge of this Detective shaped hole. Moment of silence betrayed by the slurping from a mug. Watching him as he looked to finally have a peaceful sleep. Unaware of the rude awakening that would come from this small boy. 

Deep had been the breath the child took, The only warning for what was to come now that he would yell at the top of his lungs. To string each and every vile, and cursed word, Many of which had been forgotten, ones none should ever dare to speak. Words that cut through the howling that grew silent. To Cut through the curtain of snow that had escaped from this cursing child.  For all the land felt as if it had fallen into an eerie silence. Awakening the moon that had been sleeping above. Blinding had been the light that now reflected off this town entombed in white. The boy looking to take one more breath, only to pause now swearing came with The Detective's every breathe. 

*Really have no idea just where the kid keeps picking up these things, Can't even understand most of it. Really wish it was just childish gibberish, But with how my ears feel like they want to bleed from all this ringing it's left them. . .  Don't have time for this, Need to get out of here before that damn thing decides to finish what it started. How the hell am I suppose to find my gun in all this mess. Hard to see, Let alone remember what I was suppose to be doing.* 

Muscles near frozen, to the point they could no longer shiver. For what little movement he managed to make, risked tearing each and every fiber. Skin left so pale it would nearly match the Childs, Had it not been for the tint of blue spreading across his own. Had taken him a moment to realize the boy had been standing there, Probably wouldn't have if it hadn't been for that loud slurping.

Mug now taken by The Detective that some how managed to climb out of the hole he found himself in. Had he jumped any further he'd of landed on the windshield. Not that it really mattered, Having already been busted and inside buried beneath snow. Least it gave him something to use as a foot hold. Every sip he took felt like he's been trying to choke down molten lava. How bad it burned, To slowly spread till it felt like every inch of his body had been burning from the inside out.

*Really does the trick now that I feel like I can start to move again, even if it burns like hell. If I didn't have that thing to worry about, I'd probably try to figure out just where the kid got a fresh cup of coffee in this ghost town, now that the damn power has gone out. Least all this snow is good for something. Need to get the kid some where safe.* 

""Come on kiddo, Let's find you a safe place to hide. . . Kid?"" *Really should of known better then to take my eyes off him.* 

Seemed the kid went off to find Santa. Didn't take long as the cloaked figure hadn't gone far. Having been staring down at that thing from what was left of the second floor. All those hands that it was using to latch itself upon the walls. Suspending itself up like some sort of flesh cocoon, creating layers from the chunks of flesh that had been shedding from it's body. Going so far as to replace what was left of one of the officer's heads with that of the boar that had been left hanging. Broken and mushed hands ripped free, and slapped upon it's body while others had been taking hold of various clutter. Knives, to broken shards of floorboards now being forced into the stumps of limbs now left to slowly spread over these replacement bones. Unaware it had not been alone. 

From a sleeve a small metal tube would be pulled free, one that would be placed beneath the beak upon this figure's face. For how quick fingers worked to cover the various holes, no sound could be heard. Yet something about it made the boy's head suddenly twitch and make a strange face that gave expression to one that would never show such things. Feeling as if something had been trying to crawl and wiggle into each ear. A reaction that left this masked individual to stare down at the boy that had been silently standing in their blind spot. Having only caught the movement in the corner of their eye. 

It became clear the boy hadn't been the only one that gave such an adverse reaction. With how the darkness within the cellar below would light up like the night sky above. For all those tiny shimmering stars started to swirl about, before swarming out of the hole that thing had formed in the kitchen floor. Looking as if a geyser had just erupt in all directions. To watch each of these things either leap or crawl free. To crawl across those limbs this thing used in place of webbing, to watch these tiny things begin to chew each free. What limbs this thing could spare would now be left to rapidly swing and flail about like an insects wings. Yet no matter how many it would crush, or swat away, three more would take their place. Having been caught in the undertow of this ravenous rogue wave. To be swept beneath this wave of fur, to be slowly dragged down into the depths of the cellar they once came. Molting flesh and what was left of gnawed off limbs being slowly carried off by this receding tide, that would even sweep away their dead. 

The boy having been reaching for that small instrument Santa had played to unleash this wave. Only to watch it vanish, and be replaced with the most hypnotic thing. Looking to have been a rainbow caught within a tighter spiral. How the boy stared at this colorful thing resting atop a long stick. Face now hidden behind this sugary treat. One the boy had been left holding now that he had been hoisted upon Santa's shoulders. 

Stepping off the edge, To catch themselves upon the ledge with one hand, to slowly lower the both of them the rest of the way. To silently step down upon upon what was left of the kitchen floor below. Child being slowly lowered down to his feet from the shoulder he had been left draped. Left to stand beside the blocked doorway. Figure didn't have a chance to break the boy's gaze when shower of sparks spread across the side of their masked face. Head slowly turning now in the direction the gunfire came. Seemed The Detective had managed to find The Rookie's backup weapon. Gloved hands now pressed upon the back end of the cruiser that had now become a rolling barricade, A few of those tiny things fleeing now they had picked what was left of the thing's flesh free from beneath. 

For every squeeze of the trigger the old man gave sent more sparks spreading across the cruiser that would be left peppered by spray. Every squeeze that would come before the last shell even knew it had just been ejected. Spent shells that now fell in place of snow. End of the barrel left to steam, to glow when the last of the shells were left to melt down into the snow. The Hunter had been left staring from the store front window. Moment the barrel fell silent, They had closed the gap between them in an instant. The cold had taken far too much of a toll on this Detective that had no chance to really think, let alone react. Hiss of the barrel gripped, Now that the heel of The Hunter's boot had been forced to shove against The Detective's chest. One that knocked him right off his feet, and left to lay half buried within the snow once more, Winchester being tossed aside as The Hunter would now turn to leave. To be stopped by the clicking of a fully cocked revolver. 

""Take another step and I'll paint the block with that skull of yours."" One might think this man a stubborn old fool. This man with unwavering belief in his own convictions. He simply couldn't let The Hunter walk away. Even now that his body once more begin to succumb to the icy grip that had been this deathly weather. Even now that he found himself staring upon the lead ball packed down the barrel of a flintlock pistol. Seeming to have forgotten all else in this moment, this pursuit of Justice. Even if he had not been forgotten. If only he hadn't landed beside his cherished revolver. 

Tense had been this brief moment that felt to have lasted forever. For both had been staring upon the other. Watching for the slightest twitch, or tick that would be the spark of this volatile situation. One that would end by the slurping of one polite, stray little boy that had been closely watching, awaiting this game of stare to finish. Neither needing to say a word as they had come to an unspoken agreement. Neither wished to spill the other's blood in front of this child. 

Silence broke now by the uncocking of a gun, and of the distant yelling that would follow. Seemed the gunfire had drawn the attention of others that had been trapped elsewhere. Those wearing blue uniforms, Clad in a halo of light from the flashlights and lanterns they held. The Detective had only looked in their direction a fleeting moment, and had been all The Hunter needed to vanish. Detective struggling to sit up in the snow, As the boy now offered him the warm mug he had been slurping. One the old man would take without hesitation. 

""Thanks kid, You really saved my bacon."" Slurping from a mug heard between The Detectives words. ""Mind telling me where you got this? And that for that matter?"" 

*One of these days, I'll learn to stop asking questions I know the kid won't answer. Maybe the same time the kid learns to stop taking candy from strangers.*

I was told to flag ""Empty"" videos, but I think I just flagged my own death.","It has been six months since I’ve had a proper night’s sleep, but only three days since I realized that sleep might actually be dangerous.

Before this job, I was nothing. I don’t mean that in a self-pitying, poetic way; I mean it in the literal, bureaucratic sense. I was a negative space in the economy, a statistic on a spreadsheet that policy makers argue about during election cycles. I had been unemployed for two years, a duration that shifts you from ""unlucky"" to

""unemployable"" in the eyes of hiring managers. My days were spent in a humid, suffocating loop of refreshing job boards, tweaking the formatting of a resume that no one was reading, and calculating how many calories I could cut from my diet to stretch my savings another week.

The silence of my apartment was immense weight on my shoulders. I lived in a box in a city that was too loud, surrounded by millions of people but utterly isolated. When you don't have a job, you lose the right to the rhythm of the world. You don't have weekends. You don't have ""after work."" You just have time: vast, unstructured, terrifying amounts of time that you have to fill with the performance of looking for work so you don’t collapse under the guilt of existing.

That was the mindset I was in when the recruiter reached out. It wasn’t a LinkedIn message or a standard email. It was just a direct phone call on a Tuesday afternoon. I didn’t recognize the number, but I answered it because desperation makes you reckless.

The voice on the other end was synthetic, or maybe just bored enough to sound that way. They didn’t mention where they found my number. They didn’t ask about my degree in communications or my gap in employment. They just asked if I had 20/20 vision, if I could pass a psychological evaluation, and if I was comfortable with ""high-volume visual processing.""

I said yes. I would have said yes if they asked if I was comfortable disposing of nuclear waste with my bare hands.

The interview took place in an office park on the edge of the city, one of those soulless glass cubes that looks like it was generated by an algorithm. The firm was a third-party contractor, the kind of nameless, faceless entity that exists solely to absorb liability for the big tech giants. We all know the platform; it’s the one everyone uses, the one that eats up four hours of your day scrolling through dances, recipes, and political rage. But the platform doesn't do its own dirty work. They hire companies like this one to filter the sewage before it reaches the users.

The hiring manager didn’t look me in the eye. He was a man composed entirely of beige tones: beige suit, pale skin, sandy hair, sitting in a room with white walls and a humming fluorescent light.

""The job is Content Moderation, Tier 3,"" he said, sliding a contract across the desk that was thicker than a novella. ""You aren't dealing with copyright claims or nudity. You are the filter for the extremes.""

He explained the parameters. Most moderators look for violence, hate speech, illegal acts. We would see that, yes. But our specific team, the ""night shift"" of the algorithm, had a secondary directive. We were to flag content that was classified as ""Null.""

""Null?"" I asked, holding the pen, ready to sign my life away for health insurance and a paycheck that could cover rent.

""Empty,"" he corrected, finally glancing up. His eyes were watery and tired. ""Videos with zero engagement potential. Static shots. forgotten cameras. Black screens. Silence. The algorithm hates dead air. It lowers retention. If a video has no movement, no audio, and no subject for five seconds, you flag it as 'Empty/Null' and remove it from the feed. Speed is key, and you have a quota.""

""So, I’m deleting boredom?"" I tried to joke. He didn’t smile.

""You’re deleting waste. Sign here.""

The rules of the floor were draconian. We worked in a basement level, a vast, windowless room kept at a temperature that felt designed to preserve meat. There were rows of cubicles, high-walled and padded with grey fabric that dampened sound. No personal devices. No phones, no smartwatches, no digital anything. We had to lock everything in lockers outside the security checkpoint.

And the most important rule: No talking.

""Verbal communication disrupts the flow state,"" the handbook said. If we needed a supervisor, we pressed a yellow button on our desk. If we had an emergency, we pressed red. Otherwise, we sat in silence, headphones on, eyes glued to the monitors.

I started on a Monday. My station was identical to the fifty others in the room. A comfortable ergonomic chair, a high-resolution monitor, and a specialized keypad with only two large buttons: a green one for ""Safe"" and a red one for ""Flag.""

The software was relentless. As soon as I logged in, the first video popped up. A dashcam footage of a car crash in Russia. Glass shattering, a scream, then silence.

Flag. Extreme.

Next video. A teenager in a bedroom ranting about a breakup, crying into the camera.

Safe.

Next. A grainy video of a dog running on a beach.

Safe.

Next. A static shot of a hallway in an abandoned hospital. The camera didn’t move. The dust motes danced in a shaft of light. I watched the timer in the corner of the screen. One second. Two. Three. Four. Five. Nothing happened.

Flag. Empty.

It was hypnotic., horrifying and boring. The ""Extreme"" content was bad, I saw things in my first week that made me stop eating meat, but the training had prepared me for the gore. They taught us to dissociate, to look at the screen as a collection of pixels rather than human suffering. ""It’s just red data,"" the trainer had said.

But nobody prepared me for the ""Empty.""

The Empty videos were stranger than the violence. Violence makes sense; it’s a biological imperative, a tragedy, a crime. It has a narrative. Cause and effect. But the Empty videos were something else.

I watched hours of security feed footage from warehouses where nothing moved. I watched cameras that had been dropped in the woods, filming nothing but leaves for hours. I watched livestreams from bedrooms where the occupant had left hours ago, leaving the camera staring at an unmade bed.

We were required to make a decision within five seconds. That was the metric. If you lingered, your ""efficiency score"" dropped. If it dropped too low, you were fired. So, my brain rewired itself. 

It was about three weeks in when I first saw him.

It was 3:00 AM on a Tuesday shift. My eyes were burning, dry from the recirculated air and the blue light. The video that popped up was a wide shot of a public park in London. It was overcast, grey. People were walking dogs, jogging, pushing strollers. It looked normal. I was about to hit the green button when my finger hovered.

In the background, standing near a cluster of oak trees, was a man.

He was far away, just a bundle of pixels, but something about him arrested my attention. Everyone else in the frame was in motion—blurred by the shutter speed, mid-stride, active. But this man was perfectly static. He was wearing a grey suit that seemed ill-fitting, too broad in the shoulders, and he was facing the camera directly.

I didn’t know why, but a cold prickle of unease ran down the back of my neck. I checked the timer. Four seconds.

I hit Safe and moved on. The image vanished, replaced by a cooking tutorial.

But the image stuck in my mind. 

Two days later, I saw him again.

This time, the video was a handheld shot inside a subway station in Tokyo. The camera was shaky, focused on a group of teenagers laughing and dancing. The audio was a cacophony of screeching brakes and Japanese pop music. I was scanning for ""Extreme” when I saw the reflection in the subway car window.

Standing on the platform, behind the glass, was the man in the grey suit.

He wasn’t looking at the teenagers. He was looking at the person holding the camera. Or maybe, he was looking at the lens itself. He stood with his hands at his sides, posture rigid, like a soldier at attention. The train began to move, blurring the reflection, but he didn't turn his head. He just watched the train leave.

I flagged the video as Safe but my heart was starting to scream.

I tried to tell myself it was a coincidence. The world is a big place, but humans are pattern-seeking machines. Maybe grey suits are just common. Maybe I was projecting. The isolation of the job was getting to me. I went home that morning, the sun rising over the city, and felt like a ghost haunting my own life. I slept for four hours and dreamed of static.

The sightings became more frequent.

A week later, I was processing a batch of ""Travel Vlogs."" One video was from a bustling market in Marrakech. The colors were vibrant: spices, textiles, the golden sun. The camera panned across a crowd.

There.

In the shadow of an awning, between a stall selling brass lamps and a man selling rugs. The Man in the Grey Suit.

He was closer this time. I could see details I hadn't noticed before. He was wearing a white shirt under the suit, buttoned to the top, no tie. His face was nondescript: middle-aged, pale, receding hairline. He looked like an accountant, or a mid-level bureaucrat. But it was his expression that chilled me.

It was blank. Completely devoid of emotion. He wasn't browsing. He wasn't waiting for someone. He was just... occurring. He was occupying space with a terrifying intensity.

And then I saw it.

Around his neck, hanging against the white of his shirt, was a blue lanyard.

I leaned in, violating the posture rules, squinting at the high-definition screen. The video was 4K, crisp and clear. The lanyard had a logo on it. A stylized, interlocking white knot on a blue background.

I looked down at my own chest.

I was wearing the same lanyard. It was the company logo. Our company logo.

The timer flashed red. I had taken too long. Seven seconds. A warning box appeared on my screen: EFFICIENCY ALERT. PLEASE RESUME PROCESSING.

I hit Safe with a trembling hand.

My mind began to race. Was this a test? Was the company planting these figures in videos to check if we were paying attention? But that didn't make sense. If it was a test, I should have flagged it. But under what category? He wasn't ""Extreme."" He wasn't ""Empty."" He was just there.

I looked around the room. The other moderators were slumped in their chairs; faces bathed in the cold glow of their screens. Click, click, click. The sound of a hundred decisions being made every minute. Did they see him?

I wanted to ask. I wanted to stand up and shout, ""Does anyone else see the man in the suit?""

But I couldn't. Rule number one: No talking.

I went to the breakroom during my allocated fifteen minutes. The breakroom was as sterile as the work floor: vending machines filled with energy drinks and stale sandwiches, round white tables, a smell of ozone and industrial cleaner.

There was a guy sitting at the table I usually took. I knew him only by his locker number, 402. He was young, maybe early twenties, with dark circles under his eyes that looked like bruises. He was staring into a cup of black coffee, his leg bouncing nervously.

I sat opposite him. I unclipped my lanyard and set it on the table, face up, the logo prominent.

He looked at the lanyard, then up at me. His eyes widened slightly.

I tapped the logo with my index finger. I raised my eyebrows, a silent question. Do you know?

402 looked around the room nervously. Then, he leaned in, his voice a barely audible whisper, breaking the cardinal rule.

""Don't look for them,"" he breathed.

""Them?"" I whispered back. ""You mean the man?""

He shook his head, his eyes darting back to the door. ""Not just a man. The observers. If you see them, just keep clicking. Don't let the timer run out. If you stare... they notice.""

""Who are they?""

""Quality Control,"" he said, and the way he said it sounded like a funeral rite. ""We check the feed. They check us.""

Before I could ask anything else, the breakroom door opened. A supervisor walked in, tall, sharp features, holding a tablet. 402 immediately clamped his mouth shut, grabbed his coffee, and hurried out, leaving me alone with the hum of the refrigerator.

I went back to my desk, but the rhythm was broken. The dissociation was gone. The paranoia began to bleed into my real life. On the subway ride home, I found myself scanning the platform, looking for grey suits. Every time I saw someone in business wear, my heart would stutter. I stopped going to the grocery store during peak hours. I started ordering food in. I covered the webcam on my laptop with three layers of electrical tape.

But the work continued. I had bills. I had debt. I couldn't quit.

The sightings escalated. Two nights ago, a video popped up. It was a security feed from inside a nursing home hallway. It was night. The lights were dimmed.

The Man in the Grey Suit was standing in the middle of the hallway. He was facing the camera, but his head was tilted slightly, as if he was listening to something. He took a step forward.

It was the first time I had seen him move.

He walked toward the camera with a smooth, unnatural gait. He didn't bob up and down like a normal person walking; he glided. He got closer, closer, until his face filled the frame. The pixels of his eyes were dead and flat.

He raised a hand and touched the lens of the camera. The video cut to static.

Flag. Extreme.

I slammed the button, my breath catching in my throat. I looked at the data timestamp on the video. Live Feed.

It wasn't a recording. It was happening right then. somewhere in the world, that man was walking through a nursing home, touching cameras.

I felt sick. I wanted to go to the supervisor. I wanted to report it. But report what? ""A man in a suit is walking around""? It wasn't illegal. It wasn't violent. It was just wrong.

And then came yesterday.

The shift had been grueling. The algorithm was feeding me an endless stream of ""Empty"" candidates. Hours of static shots. Parking lots. empty fields. Basements.

My brain was mush. I was operating on muscle memory. Five seconds. No movement. Flag.

A video appeared.

It was a living room. Small, dimly lit by a streetlamp outside the window. A beige sofa. A cheap wooden coffee table. A television set that was turned off. A pile of laundry on a chair in the corner.

It was quiet. Still. No movement.

I watched the timer. One. Two. Three.

My finger hovered over the Flag button. It was an Empty video. Textbook definition.

But something stopped me. A sense of familiarity that punched me in the gut.

I knew that sofa. It was the IKEA Klippan. Millions of people had that sofa.

I knew that coffee table. It was a generic heavy particleboard thing I’d bought at a thrift store.

I knew that laundry pile.

My eyes darted to the floor, near the leg of the coffee table.

Lying on the carpet, half-hidden by the shadow of the table, was a plastic bottle. Orange juice. Specifically, a store-brand bottle of pulp-free orange juice that I had bought three days ago. I had finished it before leaving for work and, in a rush, I had left the empty bottle on the floor because I missed the trash can and didn't have time to pick it up.

I stared at the screen. The bottle was there.

This was my apartment.

The air in the office seemed to vanish. I couldn't breathe. I was looking at a live feed of my own living room.

But how? I didn't have a security camera. I didn't have a webcam in the living room. My laptop was in my bedroom, closed, with tape over the lens. I didn't own a smart TV.

The angle was high up, near the ceiling corner.

I checked the timer. Four seconds. Five seconds. Six.

EFFICIENCY ALERT.

I panicked. I hit Flag: Empty. The video disappeared.

I sat there, freezing, my hands shaking so hard I couldn't feel the mouse. The rest of the shift was a blur of terror. I don't remember what I reviewed. As soon as the clock hit 7:00 AM, I sprinted to the lockers, grabbed my phone, and ran out of the building.

The ride home was agonizing. I expected to see police cars outside my building. I expected to see the door kicked in.

I burst into my apartment, wild-eyed.

It was empty. Silent.

I ran to the living room. The sofa was there. The TV. The laundry.

And the bottle. The empty orange juice bottle, lying by the coffee table leg, exactly where I had seen it on the screen.

I looked up at the corner of the room, where the camera angle had been.

There was nothing there. Just the white paint of the ceiling, a cobweb, and the smoke detector.

I dragged a chair over and climbed up. I inspected the smoke detector. It was a standard, battery-operated plastic disk. I twisted it off. No wires. No hidden lens. Just a dusty 9-volt battery.

I checked the vents. I checked the light fixtures. I tore the room apart.

There was no camera.

I sat on the floor, amidst the wreckage of my search, and tried to rationalize it. Maybe I was hallucinating. Sleep deprivation can cause psychosis. Maybe my brain projected my own memories onto a generic video of a living room. Maybe I just thought I saw the bottle.

Yes. That had to be it. I was cracking up. The job was getting to me.

I spent the day pacing, drinking too much coffee, and jumping at every noise. I didn't sleep. I couldn't. I felt exposed, like the walls were made of glass.

I almost didn't go back to work tonight. I stood at the door with my hand on the knob for ten minutes. But the fear of poverty is a powerful motivator. If I didn't go, I was fired. If I was fired, I was homeless. And if I was crazy, staying home wouldn't fix it.

I went back.

The basement was colder than usual. The silence felt heavy, pressurized. 402 wasn't at his desk. His cubicle was empty.

I sat down. Logged in. The stream began.

Cat video. Safe.

Political rant. Safe.

Storm footage. Safe.

Two hours in. My heart rate had finally started to slow down. I was convincing myself it was a hallucination.

Then, the screen flickered.

The living room appeared.

My living room.

Same angle. High up, looking down. The mess I had made searching for the camera was visible. The cushions were thrown on the floor. The chair was still in the middle of the room where I had stood to check the smoke detector.

It was undeniable. It was a live feed.

I watched, paralyzed. The timer ticked. One. Two.

Then, movement.

From the hallway on the left side of the screen, the hallway that leads to my front door, a figure walked into the frame.

It was the Man in the Grey Suit.

He was there, in my apartment, in high definition.

He walked through the debris of my living room. He didn't look at the mess. He moved with that same gliding, unnatural smoothness. He was wearing the lanyard. I could see the blue strap against his neck.

He stopped in the center of the room and looked up.

He looked directly at the invisible point where the camera should be. He looked directly at me.

His face was terrifyingly neutral. No malice. No anger. Just a professional, hollow observation. He raised his hand and gave a small, stiff wave.

Then, he turned and walked toward the bedroom. My bedroom.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to smash the monitor. I was watching a stranger invade my sanctuary while I sat helpless ten miles away in a basement.

He entered the bedroom. The angle of the camera was wide enough that I could see through the open door.

He didn't search the room. He didn't steal anything.

He got down on his hands and knees.

Slowly, methodically, he crawled under my bed.

He slid backward, disappearing into the darkness beneath the mattress, until only his polished black shoes were visible. Then, he pulled his feet in.

He was gone. Hidden. waiting.

Then, the bedroom door began to move.

There was no wind. No one else was there. But the door swung slowly, creaking on its hinges, until it clicked shut.

The view was now just my empty living room, the closed bedroom door, and the knowledge of what was behind it.

I couldn't move. My finger was frozen over the red button. I couldn't breathe. I was going to throw up.

I felt a hand on my shoulder.

I jumped so hard my knees slammed into the desk. I spun around.

It was the Supervisor. The tall man with the sharp features.

He was looking at my screen. At the live feed of my apartment.

He didn't look surprised. He didn't look concerned. Just looked bored.

He leaned over, his cologne smelling of antiseptic and mint. He reached out with a pale, manicured hand.

""Don't flag that one,"" he said, his voice smooth and quiet.

""That's..."" I stammered, my voice cracking from disuse. ""That's my apartment. That's my home.""

The Supervisor looked at me then. His eyes were the same flat, dead color as the man on the screen.

""We know,"" he said.

He tapped the screen, right over the image of the closed bedroom door.

""It's just a calibration test. Surveillance optimization.""

""There's a man,"" I whispered, tears pricking my eyes. ""He crawled under my bed. He's under my bed right now.""

The Supervisor smiled. The smile a predator gives when the prey has nowhere left to run.

""Technically,"" he said, straightening his tie which hung from a blue lanyard with a white knot ""he's not a man. And technically, it's not your bed anymore. It's company property. Read your contract. Clause 14, subsection B: 'The employee agrees to total environmental immersion for quality assurance purposes.'""

He patted my shoulder again. It felt like being touched by a mannequin.

""Don't worry about him.""

He gestured to the screen.

""Now, mark it as 'Internal' and keep working. Your efficiency is dropping. You have quotas to meet, and surly you don’t want to know what happens if it drooped further, you already had a glimpse of it""

He walked away, his footsteps silent on the carpeted floor.

I turned back to the screen. The living room was still there. The bedroom door was still closed.

I marked it as Internal.

The video disappeared. A clip of a cat chasing a laser pointer replaced it.

I’m still at my desk. My shift ends in twenty minutes.

I can't leave. I can't go home. I know what's waiting for me in the dark under the bed. 

But I can't stay here. The security guards will clear the floor at 8:00 AM. They will force me out.

I’m writing this on a notepad window I managed to open by bypassing the admin lock. I’m going to post as soon as I get out of here. What should I do?",3,1770224420.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

When you don't have a job, you lose the right to the rhythm of the world. You don't have weekends. You don't have ""after work."" You just have time: vast, unstructured, terrifying amounts of time that you have to fill with the performance of looking for work so you don’t collapse under the guilt of existing.

That was the mindset I was in when the recruiter reached out. It wasn’t a LinkedIn message or a standard email. It was just a direct phone call on a Tuesday afternoon. I didn’t recognize the number, but I answered it because desperation makes you reckless.

The voice on the other end was synthetic, or maybe just bored enough to sound that way. They didn’t mention where they found my number. They didn’t ask about my degree in communications or my gap in employment. They just asked if I had 20/20 vision, if I could pass a psychological evaluation, and if I was comfortable with ""high-volume visual processing.""

I said yes. I would have said yes if they asked if I was comfortable disposing of nuclear waste with my bare hands.

The interview took place in an office park on the edge of the city, one of those soulless glass cubes that looks like it was generated by an algorithm. The firm was a third-party contractor, the kind of nameless, faceless entity that exists solely to absorb liability for the big tech giants. We all know the platform; it’s the one everyone uses, the one that eats up four hours of your day scrolling through dances, recipes, and political rage. But the platform doesn't do its own dirty work. They hire companies like this one to filter the sewage before it reaches the users.

The hiring manager didn’t look me in the eye. He was a man composed entirely of beige tones: beige suit, pale skin, sandy hair, sitting in a room with white walls and a humming fluorescent light.

""The job is Content Moderation, Tier 3,"" he said, sliding a contract across the desk that was thicker than a novella. ""You aren't dealing with copyright claims or nudity. You are the filter for the extremes.""

He explained the parameters. Most moderators look for violence, hate speech, illegal acts. We would see that, yes. But our specific team, the ""night shift"" of the algorithm, had a secondary directive. We were to flag content that was classified as ""Null.""

""Null?"" I asked, holding the pen, ready to sign my life away for health insurance and a paycheck that could cover rent.

""Empty,"" he corrected, finally glancing up. His eyes were watery and tired. ""Videos with zero engagement potential. Static shots. forgotten cameras. Black screens. Silence. The algorithm hates dead air. It lowers retention. If a video has no movement, no audio, and no subject for five seconds, you flag it as 'Empty/Null' and remove it from the feed. Speed is key, and you have a quota.""

""So, I’m deleting boredom?"" I tried to joke. He didn’t smile.

""You’re deleting waste. Sign here.""

The rules of the floor were draconian. We worked in a basement level, a vast, windowless room kept at a temperature that felt designed to preserve meat. There were rows of cubicles, high-walled and padded with grey fabric that dampened sound. No personal devices. No phones, no smartwatches, no digital anything. We had to lock everything in lockers outside the security checkpoint.

And the most important rule: No talking.

""Verbal communication disrupts the flow state,"" the handbook said. If we needed a supervisor, we pressed a yellow button on our desk. If we had an emergency, we pressed red. Otherwise, we sat in silence, headphones on, eyes glued to the monitors.

I started on a Monday. My station was identical to the fifty others in the room. A comfortable ergonomic chair, a high-resolution monitor, and a specialized keypad with only two large buttons: a green one for ""Safe"" and a red one for ""Flag.""

The software was relentless. As soon as I logged in, the first video popped up. A dashcam footage of a car crash in Russia. Glass shattering, a scream, then silence.

Flag. Extreme.

Next video. A teenager in a bedroom ranting about a breakup, crying into the camera.

Safe.

Next. A grainy video of a dog running on a beach.

Safe.

Next. A static shot of a hallway in an abandoned hospital. The camera didn’t move. The dust motes danced in a shaft of light. I watched the timer in the corner of the screen. One second. Two. Three. Four. Five. Nothing happened.

Flag. Empty.

It was hypnotic., horrifying and boring. The ""Extreme"" content was bad, I saw things in my first week that made me stop eating meat, but the training had prepared me for the gore. They taught us to dissociate, to look at the screen as a collection of pixels rather than human suffering. ""It’s just red data,"" the trainer had said.

But nobody prepared me for the ""Empty.""

The Empty videos were stranger than the violence. Violence makes sense; it’s a biological imperative, a tragedy, a crime. It has a narrative. Cause and effect. But the Empty videos were something else.

I watched hours of security feed footage from warehouses where nothing moved. I watched cameras that had been dropped in the woods, filming nothing but leaves for hours. I watched livestreams from bedrooms where the occupant had left hours ago, leaving the camera staring at an unmade bed.

We were required to make a decision within five seconds. That was the metric. If you lingered, your ""efficiency score"" dropped. If it dropped too low, you were fired. So, my brain rewired itself. 

It was about three weeks in when I first saw him.

It was 3:00 AM on a Tuesday shift. My eyes were burning, dry from the recirculated air and the blue light. The video that popped up was a wide shot of a public park in London. It was overcast, grey. People were walking dogs, jogging, pushing strollers. It looked normal. I was about to hit the green button when my finger hovered.

In the background, standing near a cluster of oak trees, was a man.

He was far away, just a bundle of pixels, but something about him arrested my attention. Everyone else in the frame was in motion—blurred by the shutter speed, mid-stride, active. But this man was perfectly static. He was wearing a grey suit that seemed ill-fitting, too broad in the shoulders, and he was facing the camera directly.

I didn’t know why, but a cold prickle of unease ran down the back of my neck. I checked the timer. Four seconds.

I hit Safe and moved on. The image vanished, replaced by a cooking tutorial.

But the image stuck in my mind. 

Two days later, I saw him again.

This time, the video was a handheld shot inside a subway station in Tokyo. The camera was shaky, focused on a group of teenagers laughing and dancing. The audio was a cacophony of screeching brakes and Japanese pop music. I was scanning for ""Extreme” when I saw the reflection in the subway car window.

Standing on the platform, behind the glass, was the man in the grey suit.

He wasn’t looking at the teenagers. He was looking at the person holding the camera. Or maybe, he was looking at the lens itself. He stood with his hands at his sides, posture rigid, like a soldier at attention. The train began to move, blurring the reflection, but he didn't turn his head. He just watched the train leave.

I flagged the video as Safe but my heart was starting to scream.

I tried to tell myself it was a coincidence. The world is a big place, but humans are pattern-seeking machines. Maybe grey suits are just common. Maybe I was projecting. The isolation of the job was getting to me. I went home that morning, the sun rising over the city, and felt like a ghost haunting my own life. I slept for four hours and dreamed of static.

The sightings became more frequent.

A week later, I was processing a batch of ""Travel Vlogs."" One video was from a bustling market in Marrakech. The colors were vibrant: spices, textiles, the golden sun. The camera panned across a crowd.

There.

In the shadow of an awning, between a stall selling brass lamps and a man selling rugs. The Man in the Grey Suit.

He was closer this time. I could see details I hadn't noticed before. He was wearing a white shirt under the suit, buttoned to the top, no tie. His face was nondescript: middle-aged, pale, receding hairline. He looked like an accountant, or a mid-level bureaucrat. But it was his expression that chilled me.

It was blank. Completely devoid of emotion. He wasn't browsing. He wasn't waiting for someone. He was just... occurring. He was occupying space with a terrifying intensity.

And then I saw it.

Around his neck, hanging against the white of his shirt, was a blue lanyard.

I leaned in, violating the posture rules, squinting at the high-definition screen. The video was 4K, crisp and clear. The lanyard had a logo on it. A stylized, interlocking white knot on a blue background.

I looked down at my own chest.

I was wearing the same lanyard. It was the company logo. Our company logo.

The timer flashed red. I had taken too long. Seven seconds. A warning box appeared on my screen: EFFICIENCY ALERT. PLEASE RESUME PROCESSING.

I hit Safe with a trembling hand.

My mind began to race. Was this a test? Was the company planting these figures in videos to check if we were paying attention? But that didn't make sense. If it was a test, I should have flagged it. But under what category? He wasn't ""Extreme."" He wasn't ""Empty."" He was just there.

I looked around the room. The other moderators were slumped in their chairs; faces bathed in the cold glow of their screens. Click, click, click. The sound of a hundred decisions being made every minute. Did they see him?

I wanted to ask. I wanted to stand up and shout, ""Does anyone else see the man in the suit?""

But I couldn't. Rule number one: No talking.

I went to the breakroom during my allocated fifteen minutes. The breakroom was as sterile as the work floor: vending machines filled with energy drinks and stale sandwiches, round white tables, a smell of ozone and industrial cleaner.

There was a guy sitting at the table I usually took. I knew him only by his locker number, 402. He was young, maybe early twenties, with dark circles under his eyes that looked like bruises. He was staring into a cup of black coffee, his leg bouncing nervously.

I sat opposite him. I unclipped my lanyard and set it on the table, face up, the logo prominent.

He looked at the lanyard, then up at me. His eyes widened slightly.

I tapped the logo with my index finger. I raised my eyebrows, a silent question. Do you know?

402 looked around the room nervously. Then, he leaned in, his voice a barely audible whisper, breaking the cardinal rule.

""Don't look for them,"" he breathed.

""Them?"" I whispered back. ""You mean the man?""

He shook his head, his eyes darting back to the door. ""Not just a man. The observers. If you see them, just keep clicking. Don't let the timer run out. If you stare... they notice.""

""Who are they?""

""Quality Control,"" he said, and the way he said it sounded like a funeral rite. ""We check the feed. They check us.""

Before I could ask anything else, the breakroom door opened. A supervisor walked in, tall, sharp features, holding a tablet. 402 immediately clamped his mouth shut, grabbed his coffee, and hurried out, leaving me alone with the hum of the refrigerator.

I went back to my desk, but the rhythm was broken. The dissociation was gone. The paranoia began to bleed into my real life. On the subway ride home, I found myself scanning the platform, looking for grey suits. Every time I saw someone in business wear, my heart would stutter. I stopped going to the grocery store during peak hours. I started ordering food in. I covered the webcam on my laptop with three layers of electrical tape.

But the work continued. I had bills. I had debt. I couldn't quit.

The sightings escalated. Two nights ago, a video popped up. It was a security feed from inside a nursing home hallway. It was night. The lights were dimmed.

The Man in the Grey Suit was standing in the middle of the hallway. He was facing the camera, but his head was tilted slightly, as if he was listening to something. He took a step forward.

It was the first time I had seen him move.

He walked toward the camera with a smooth, unnatural gait. He didn't bob up and down like a normal person walking; he glided. He got closer, closer, until his face filled the frame. The pixels of his eyes were dead and flat.

He raised a hand and touched the lens of the camera. The video cut to static.

Flag. Extreme.

I slammed the button, my breath catching in my throat. I looked at the data timestamp on the video. Live Feed.

It wasn't a recording. It was happening right then. somewhere in the world, that man was walking through a nursing home, touching cameras.

I felt sick. I wanted to go to the supervisor. I wanted to report it. But report what? ""A man in a suit is walking around""? It wasn't illegal. It wasn't violent. It was just wrong.

And then came yesterday.

The shift had been grueling. The algorithm was feeding me an endless stream of ""Empty"" candidates. Hours of static shots. Parking lots. empty fields. Basements.

My brain was mush. I was operating on muscle memory. Five seconds. No movement. Flag.

A video appeared.

It was a living room. Small, dimly lit by a streetlamp outside the window. A beige sofa. A cheap wooden coffee table. A television set that was turned off. A pile of laundry on a chair in the corner.

It was quiet. Still. No movement.

I watched the timer. One. Two. Three.

My finger hovered over the Flag button. It was an Empty video. Textbook definition.

But something stopped me. A sense of familiarity that punched me in the gut.

I knew that sofa. It was the IKEA Klippan. Millions of people had that sofa.

I knew that coffee table. It was a generic heavy particleboard thing I’d bought at a thrift store.

I knew that laundry pile.

My eyes darted to the floor, near the leg of the coffee table.

Lying on the carpet, half-hidden by the shadow of the table, was a plastic bottle. Orange juice. Specifically, a store-brand bottle of pulp-free orange juice that I had bought three days ago. I had finished it before leaving for work and, in a rush, I had left the empty bottle on the floor because I missed the trash can and didn't have time to pick it up.

I stared at the screen. The bottle was there.

This was my apartment.

The air in the office seemed to vanish. I couldn't breathe. I was looking at a live feed of my own living room.

But how? I didn't have a security camera. I didn't have a webcam in the living room. My laptop was in my bedroom, closed, with tape over the lens. I didn't own a smart TV.

The angle was high up, near the ceiling corner.

I checked the timer. Four seconds. Five seconds. Six.

EFFICIENCY ALERT.

I panicked. I hit Flag: Empty. The video disappeared.

I sat there, freezing, my hands shaking so hard I couldn't feel the mouse. The rest of the shift was a blur of terror. I don't remember what I reviewed. As soon as the clock hit 7:00 AM, I sprinted to the lockers, grabbed my phone, and ran out of the building.

The ride home was agonizing. I expected to see police cars outside my building. I expected to see the door kicked in.

I burst into my apartment, wild-eyed.

It was empty. Silent.

I ran to the living room. The sofa was there. The TV. The laundry.

And the bottle. The empty orange juice bottle, lying by the coffee table leg, exactly where I had seen it on the screen.

I looked up at the corner of the room, where the camera angle had been.

There was nothing there. Just the white paint of the ceiling, a cobweb, and the smoke detector.

I dragged a chair over and climbed up. I inspected the smoke detector. It was a standard, battery-operated plastic disk. I twisted it off. No wires. No hidden lens. Just a dusty 9-volt battery.

I checked the vents. I checked the light fixtures. I tore the room apart.

There was no camera.

I sat on the floor, amidst the wreckage of my search, and tried to rationalize it. Maybe I was hallucinating. Sleep deprivation can cause psychosis. Maybe my brain projected my own memories onto a generic video of a living room. Maybe I just thought I saw the bottle.

Yes. That had to be it. I was cracking up. The job was getting to me.

I spent the day pacing, drinking too much coffee, and jumping at every noise. I didn't sleep. I couldn't. I felt exposed, like the walls were made of glass.

I almost didn't go back to work tonight. I stood at the door with my hand on the knob for ten minutes. But the fear of poverty is a powerful motivator. If I didn't go, I was fired. If I was fired, I was homeless. And if I was crazy, staying home wouldn't fix it.

I went back.

The basement was colder than usual. The silence felt heavy, pressurized. 402 wasn't at his desk. His cubicle was empty.

I sat down. Logged in. The stream began.

Cat video. Safe.

Political rant. Safe.

Storm footage. Safe.

Two hours in. My heart rate had finally started to slow down. I was convincing myself it was a hallucination.

Then, the screen flickered.

The living room appeared.

My living room.

Same angle. High up, looking down. The mess I had made searching for the camera was visible. The cushions were thrown on the floor. The chair was still in the middle of the room where I had stood to check the smoke detector.

It was undeniable. It was a live feed.

I watched, paralyzed. The timer ticked. One. Two.

Then, movement.

From the hallway on the left side of the screen, the hallway that leads to my front door, a figure walked into the frame.

It was the Man in the Grey Suit.

He was there, in my apartment, in high definition.

He walked through the debris of my living room. He didn't look at the mess. He moved with that same gliding, unnatural smoothness. He was wearing the lanyard. I could see the blue strap against his neck.

He stopped in the center of the room and looked up.

He looked directly at the invisible point where the camera should be. He looked directly at me.

His face was terrifyingly neutral. No malice. No anger. Just a professional, hollow observation. He raised his hand and gave a small, stiff wave.

Then, he turned and walked toward the bedroom. My bedroom.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to smash the monitor. I was watching a stranger invade my sanctuary while I sat helpless ten miles away in a basement.

He entered the bedroom. The angle of the camera was wide enough that I could see through the open door.

He didn't search the room. He didn't steal anything.

He got down on his hands and knees.

Slowly, methodically, he crawled under my bed.

He slid backward, disappearing into the darkness beneath the mattress, until only his polished black shoes were visible. Then, he pulled his feet in.

He was gone. Hidden. waiting.

Then, the bedroom door began to move.

There was no wind. No one else was there. But the door swung slowly, creaking on its hinges, until it clicked shut.

The view was now just my empty living room, the closed bedroom door, and the knowledge of what was behind it.

I couldn't move. My finger was frozen over the red button. I couldn't breathe. I was going to throw up.

I felt a hand on my shoulder.

I jumped so hard my knees slammed into the desk. I spun around.

It was the Supervisor. The tall man with the sharp features.

He was looking at my screen. At the live feed of my apartment.

He didn't look surprised. He didn't look concerned. Just looked bored.

He leaned over, his cologne smelling of antiseptic and mint. He reached out with a pale, manicured hand.

""Don't flag that one,"" he said, his voice smooth and quiet.

""That's..."" I stammered, my voice cracking from disuse. ""That's my apartment. That's my home.""

The Supervisor looked at me then. His eyes were the same flat, dead color as the man on the screen.

""We know,"" he said.

He tapped the screen, right over the image of the closed bedroom door.

""It's just a calibration test. Surveillance optimization.""

""There's a man,"" I whispered, tears pricking my eyes. ""He crawled under my bed. He's under my bed right now.""

The Supervisor smiled. The smile a predator gives when the prey has nowhere left to run.

""Technically,"" he said, straightening his tie which hung from a blue lanyard with a white knot ""he's not a man. And technically, it's not your bed anymore. It's company property. Read your contract. Clause 14, subsection B: 'The employee agrees to total environmental immersion for quality assurance purposes.'""

He patted my shoulder again. It felt like being touched by a mannequin.

""Don't worry about him.""

He gestured to the screen.

""Now, mark it as 'Internal' and keep working. Your efficiency is dropping. You have quotas to meet, and surly you don’t want to know what happens if it drooped further, you already had a glimpse of it""

He walked away, his footsteps silent on the carpeted floor.

I turned back to the screen. The living room was still there. The bedroom door was still closed.

I marked it as Internal.

The video disappeared. A clip of a cat chasing a laser pointer replaced it.

I’m still at my desk. My shift ends in twenty minutes.

I can't leave. I can't go home. I know what's waiting for me in the dark under the bed. 

But I can't stay here. The security guards will clear the floor at 8:00 AM. They will force me out.

There was a guy sitting at the table I usually took. I knew him only by his locker number, 402. He was young, maybe early twenties, with dark circles under his eyes that looked like bruises. He was staring into a cup of black coffee, his leg bouncing nervously.

I sat opposite him. I unclipped my lanyard and set it on the table, face up, the logo prominent.

He looked at the lanyard, then up at me. His eyes widened slightly.

I tapped the logo with my index finger. I raised my eyebrows, a silent question. Do you know?

402 looked around the room nervously. Then, he leaned in, his voice a barely audible whisper, breaking the cardinal rule.

""Don't look for them,"" he breathed.

""Them?"" I whispered back. ""You mean the man?""

He shook his head, his eyes darting back to the door. ""Not just a man. The observers. If you see them, just keep clicking. Don't let the timer run out. If you stare... they notice.""

""Who are they?""

""Quality Control,"" he said, and the way he said it sounded like a funeral rite. ""We check the feed. They check us.""

Before I could ask anything else, the breakroom door opened. A supervisor walked in, tall, sharp features, holding a tablet. 402 immediately clamped his mouth shut, grabbed his coffee, and hurried out, leaving me alone with the hum of the refrigerator.

I went back to my desk, but the rhythm was broken. The dissociation was gone. The paranoia began to bleed into my real life. On the subway ride home, I found myself scanning the platform, looking for grey suits. Every time I saw someone in business wear, my heart would stutter. I stopped going to the grocery store during peak hours. I started ordering food in. I covered the webcam on my laptop with three layers of electrical tape.

But the work continued. I had bills. I had debt. I couldn't quit.

The sightings escalated. Two nights ago, a video popped up. It was a security feed from inside a nursing home hallway. It was night. The lights were dimmed.

The Man in the Grey Suit was standing in the middle of the hallway. He was facing the camera, but his head was tilted slightly, as if he was listening to something. He took a step forward.

It was the first time I had seen him move.

He walked toward the camera with a smooth, unnatural gait. He didn't bob up and down like a normal person walking; he glided. He got closer, closer, until his face filled the frame. The pixels of his eyes were dead and flat.

He raised a hand and touched the lens of the camera. The video cut to static.

Flag. Extreme.

I slammed the button, my breath catching in my throat. I looked at the data timestamp on the video. Live Feed.

It wasn't a recording. It was happening right then. somewhere in the world, that man was walking through a nursing home, touching cameras.

I felt sick. I wanted to go to the supervisor. I wanted to report it. But report what? ""A man in a suit is walking around""? It wasn't illegal. It wasn't violent. It was just wrong.

And then came yesterday.

The shift had been grueling. The algorithm was feeding me an endless stream of ""Empty"" candidates. Hours of static shots. Parking lots. empty fields. Basements.

My brain was mush. I was operating on muscle memory. Five seconds. No movement. Flag.

A video appeared.

It was a living room. Small, dimly lit by a streetlamp outside the window. A beige sofa. A cheap wooden coffee table. A television set that was turned off. A pile of laundry on a chair in the corner.

It was quiet. Still. No movement.

I watched the timer. One. Two. Three.

My finger hovered over the Flag button. It was an Empty video. Textbook definition.

But something stopped me. A sense of familiarity that punched me in the gut.

I knew that sofa. It was the IKEA Klippan. Millions of people had that sofa.

I knew that coffee table. It was a generic heavy particleboard thing I’d bought at a thrift store.

I knew that laundry pile.

My eyes darted to the floor, near the leg of the coffee table.

Lying on the carpet, half-hidden by the shadow of the table, was a plastic bottle. Orange juice. Specifically, a store-brand bottle of pulp-free orange juice that I had bought three days ago. I had finished it before leaving for work and, in a rush, I had left the empty bottle on the floor because I missed the trash can and didn't have time to pick it up.

I stared at the screen. The bottle was there.

This was my apartment.

The air in the office seemed to vanish. I couldn't breathe. I was looking at a live feed of my own living room.

But how? I didn't have a security camera. I didn't have a webcam in the living room. My laptop was in my bedroom, closed, with tape over the lens. I didn't own a smart TV.

The angle was high up, near the ceiling corner.

I checked the timer. Four seconds. Five seconds. Six.

EFFICIENCY ALERT.

I panicked. I hit Flag: Empty. The video disappeared.

I sat there, freezing, my hands shaking so hard I couldn't feel the mouse. The rest of the shift was a blur of terror. I don't remember what I reviewed. As soon as the clock hit 7:00 AM, I sprinted to the lockers, grabbed my phone, and ran out of the building.

The ride home was agonizing. I expected to see police cars outside my building. I expected to see the door kicked in.

I burst into my apartment, wild-eyed.

It was empty. Silent.

I ran to the living room. The sofa was there. The TV. The laundry.

And the bottle. The empty orange juice bottle, lying by the coffee table leg, exactly where I had seen it on the screen.

I looked up at the corner of the room, where the camera angle had been.

There was nothing there. Just the white paint of the ceiling, a cobweb, and the smoke detector.

I dragged a chair over and climbed up. I inspected the smoke detector. It was a standard, battery-operated plastic disk. I twisted it off. No wires. No hidden lens. Just a dusty 9-volt battery.

I checked the vents. I checked the light fixtures. I tore the room apart.

There was no camera.

I sat on the floor, amidst the wreckage of my search, and tried to rationalize it. Maybe I was hallucinating. Sleep deprivation can cause psychosis. Maybe my brain projected my own memories onto a generic video of a living room. Maybe I just thought I saw the bottle.

Yes. That had to be it. I was cracking up. The job was getting to me.

I spent the day pacing, drinking too much coffee, and jumping at every noise. I didn't sleep. I couldn't. I felt exposed, like the walls were made of glass.

I almost didn't go back to work tonight. I stood at the door with my hand on the knob for ten minutes. But the fear of poverty is a powerful motivator. If I didn't go, I was fired. If I was fired, I was homeless. And if I was crazy, staying home wouldn't fix it.

I went back.

The basement was colder than usual. The silence felt heavy, pressurized. 402 wasn't at his desk. His cubicle was empty.

I sat down. Logged in. The stream began.

Cat video. Safe.

Political rant. Safe.

Storm footage. Safe.

Two hours in. My heart rate had finally started to slow down. I was convincing myself it was a hallucination.

Then, the screen flickered.

The living room appeared.

My living room.

Same angle. High up, looking down. The mess I had made searching for the camera was visible. The cushions were thrown on the floor. The chair was still in the middle of the room where I had stood to check the smoke detector.

It was undeniable. It was a live feed.

I watched, paralyzed. The timer ticked. One. Two.

Then, movement.

From the hallway on the left side of the screen, the hallway that leads to my front door, a figure walked into the frame.

It was the Man in the Grey Suit.

He was there, in my apartment, in high definition.

He walked through the debris of my living room. He didn't look at the mess. He moved with that same gliding, unnatural smoothness. He was wearing the lanyard. I could see the blue strap against his neck.

He stopped in the center of the room and looked up.

He looked directly at the invisible point where the camera should be. He looked directly at me.

His face was terrifyingly neutral. No malice. No anger. Just a professional, hollow observation. He raised his hand and gave a small, stiff wave.

Then, he turned and walked toward the bedroom. My bedroom.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to smash the monitor. I was watching a stranger invade my sanctuary while I sat helpless ten miles away in a basement.

He entered the bedroom. The angle of the camera was wide enough that I could see through the open door.

He didn't search the room. He didn't steal anything.

He got down on his hands and knees.

Slowly, methodically, he crawled under my bed.

He slid backward, disappearing into the darkness beneath the mattress, until only his polished black shoes were visible. Then, he pulled his feet in.

He was gone. Hidden. waiting.

Then, the bedroom door began to move.

There was no wind. No one else was there. But the door swung slowly, creaking on its hinges, until it clicked shut.

The view was now just my empty living room, the closed bedroom door, and the knowledge of what was behind it.

I couldn't move. My finger was frozen over the red button. I couldn't breathe. I was going to throw up.

I felt a hand on my shoulder.

I jumped so hard my knees slammed into the desk. I spun around.

It was the Supervisor. The tall man with the sharp features.

He was looking at my screen. At the live feed of my apartment.

He didn't look surprised. He didn't look concerned. Just looked bored.

He leaned over, his cologne smelling of antiseptic and mint. He reached out with a pale, manicured hand.

""Don't flag that one,"" he said, his voice smooth and quiet.

""That's..."" I stammered, my voice cracking from disuse. ""That's my apartment. That's my home.""

The Supervisor looked at me then. His eyes were the same flat, dead color as the man on the screen.

""We know,"" he said.

He tapped the screen, right over the image of the closed bedroom door.

""It's just a calibration test. Surveillance optimization.""

""There's a man,"" I whispered, tears pricking my eyes. ""He crawled under my bed. He's under my bed right now.""

The Supervisor smiled. The smile a predator gives when the prey has nowhere left to run.

""Technically,"" he said, straightening his tie which hung from a blue lanyard with a white knot ""he's not a man. And technically, it's not your bed anymore. It's company property. Read your contract. Clause 14, subsection B: 'The employee agrees to total environmental immersion for quality assurance purposes.'""

He patted my shoulder again. It felt like being touched by a mannequin.

""Don't worry about him.""

He gestured to the screen.

""Now, mark it as 'Internal' and keep working. Your efficiency is dropping. You have quotas to meet, and surly you don’t want to know what happens if it drooped further, you already had a glimpse of it""

He walked away, his footsteps silent on the carpeted floor.

I turned back to the screen. The living room was still there. The bedroom door was still closed.

I marked it as Internal.

The video disappeared. A clip of a cat chasing a laser pointer replaced it.

I’m still at my desk. My shift ends in twenty minutes.

I can't leave. I can't go home. I know what's waiting for me in the dark under the bed. 

But I can't stay here. The security guards will clear the floor at 8:00 AM. They will force me out.

I just published my first PyPI package called **agrobr**

**What my project does:**

It's a production-grade wrapper for Brazilian agricultural data sources. One line of code gives you commodity prices, harvest forecasts, and production statistics:

python

pip install agrobr

from agrobr import cepea, conab, ibge

\# Soybean prices

df = await cepea.indicador(""soja"")

\# Corn harvest data

df = await conab.safras(""milho"")

\# Coffee production stats

df = await ibge.pam(""cafe"")

**Target audience:**

Anyone working with agricultural/commodity data in Brazil. Getting this data manually is painful - CEPEA blocks scrapers, CONAB uses inconsistent Excel files, IBGE has a complex API. This library handles all of that.

It's meant for production use (data pipelines, research, trading analysis), not just a toy project.

**Comparison:**

There's no equivalent library for Brazilian agricultural data. Compared to manual scraping that i know of.

Compared to manual scraping:

264 tests passing

Smart caching with DuckDB (accumulates historical data automatically)

Automatic fallback when sources fail

Schema stability contracts (your pipeline won't break)

Data lineage with \`return\_meta=True\`

Quality certification system (GOLD/SILVER/BRONZE)

Plugin architecture for custom sources

1qvtwqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qvtwqr/met_up_with_my_ex_last_night/,Met up with my ex last night,"I (34M) met up with my ex (31F) last night and talk about conflicting emotions.

I’m not gonna get too deep into the break up, but basically we were together for like five months. We went out with one of her friends I had never met before. Of course we were drinking all night and her friend is just pretty nasty to me and at one point I’ve had enough and I left. At the time I felt my ex was not defending me, so I just got up and left. I didn’t abandoned my ex at the bar because she showed up with her friend. But right afterwards I had sent her a a few angry text messages. Not directed at my ex but about how disrespected I felt by her friend and how I felt that she just stood by and did nothing. They were definitely pretty angry. I don’t remember word for word but I’ll die on the hill that they weren’t directed at her. It was directed at the situation. It was a stupid fucking drunk blowup. And then to make it worse after I left, she had called, i didnt answer, I turned off my location and I went home and I didn’t call her until the next evening. And she said she was having anxiety attacks the whole day because she didn’t know what was going on until I called her.

I’m fully aware I fucked up. But before that, we had a great relationship. I was a little emotionally guarded together but I apologized for that. But we never fought, never had an argument, if there was a problem, we talked about it like adults and moved on. I did care for her and she knows I did. I just needed to be more open. But I was getting there. I was working on it through therapy, and we just started evolving our relationship. She was just out pacing  me. We were together for five months and I told her I was scared that if I let her in fully, she was going to hurt me. And I kind of did to her what I thought she might do to me. And that was never my intention But after talking, I had triggered something in her that happened in her past and she couldn’t move past that. So we broke up. I had issues in my past relationships that affected ours, and she did too.

Fast forward six months, I’m browsing TikTok and I see something that she may like and I’m in my feels so I sent it to her. I don’t know why. We hadn’t talked since we broke up. But something just didn’t feel right about all that. It ended so abruptly.

A few days later, she sends one back. I send one back a little bit later. Over the next six weeks, they get more frequent, more flirty, more intimate. I cracked at one point and apologized again for what I did and she basically said she just doesn’t wanna reopen that door. I totally understood and asked if she ever wanted to meet up for coffee and catch up I’d like that. To my surprise, she said yes.

About a week later we meet up. We had a nice conversation that lasted about two hours.

She said she hated me for a while, which was understandable. That she went through a hard depression episode and had lots of anxiety, lots of doubt. It was incredibly hard for her. She told me she didn’t know if I even liked her when we were together. But I did and I told her I liked even when we were together. But I’ve been in a relationship with an avoidant before and I know how words feel versus actions. And then I became one, never intending to. It just happened.

But as time went on those angry feelings faded for her. And she started to appreciate the good times we had. She thinks if we got back together, she wouldn’t be able to move past what I triggered. Which is understandable. She said she wanted to be friends though, and I said I couldn’t do that. I don’t wanna hear about who you’re dating when you do. Even if you don’t date anybody we’re both still attached a little bit. Me obviously more so. And being in connection isn’t going to help.

I didn’t know what my plan was when I reached out. I just missed talking to her. I would’ve gotten back together, but I’m not about to argue for it. I didn’t know how much feelings I had left until I saw her last night. And that dug up a lot. I didn’t try to defend my actions. Only apologize for them and give her the chance to tell me how they made her feel. And holy fuck that broke my heart.

We said we’ll see each other again, but I don’t know if I can do that. I may just call her in a few days and tell her that I’ve enjoyed talking to her again, but this is becoming very hard for me. And I basically told her that last night. She knows exactly how I still feel. She didn’t shut it down, she didn’t tell me she doesn’t feel the same way. But there’s clearly a block here that she doesn’t think she can get over, and I don’t want to be with somebody who can’t fully lean in again.

I don’t really know what the point of this post is. I’m really happy we met, but I’m really sad now. I’m sad that I lost somebody who genuinely cared for me and that I had a big part of that. I’ve never been the cause of a relationship failing before. So that’s very tough for me to deal with. I’ve been eating myself alive for the last six months and it does feel freeing to tell her that. I truly care about her a lot, I was starting to love her. I just didn’t know how to say it yet. But I put it all on the table last night. And so did she. But for the last six months I had just had this nagging thought that something wasn’t right. And that got answered last night.

And this is such a change of pace because anytime I have reached out to an ex before that they told me to fuck off. And I eventually leaned into anger to get over them. I can’t do that with her though. I’m the one who fucked up and even though we got some clarity and we’re good with each other and we still care for each other. That’s gotta be that.

The problem is this isn't a video game where you can just force any trade that works. 

No team out there is excited to get Maxi Kleiber or Gabe Vincent or Vanderbilt or Dalton Knecht. Nobody wants that shit. Why would any team take those guys, they aren't contributors. 

And teams that want the expiring deals don't have players the Lakers need. Thus, they haven't made any moves because there aren't moves to make. The Kings flipped Keon Ellis into DeAndre Hunter. Clearly they're trying to be competent and not tank, so the Lakers couldn't have offered them anything of value. 

The only real trade piece the Lakers have is Rui, but it'd be braindead to trade literally the only competent shooter on the team, so they probably won't.

1qvtvk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qvtvk4/i_should_be_32_years_sober_today_but_im_counting/,I should be 32 years sober today. But I'm counting days instead.,"I first got sober on February 4th 1994 and stayed sober for nine years. Throughout that time, as most Alcoholics tend to do, I would occasionally wonder about whether I could go back to drinking. After all I, was just 24 when I got sober. Hadn't I kicked it by now?

Finally, one day in my 30s, I did just that. It wasn't anything I planned to do. I was out with friends at a cafe that happened to serve beer and everybody was having one. No one in the group was an alcoholic (that I could tell, anyway), so they were drinking normally.

I went up to order a coffee and very spontaneously found myself ordering a beer instead. I was in Texas at the time and they had Shiner Bock beer on tap, a local beer. Why not try it? After all, when in Texas....

It took me nearly 20 years after that to finally get sober again. At first, my drinking was controlled and casual but within a few years I was back to daily drinking and it progressed steadily from there. By the time I stopped again, I was drinking more than half a box of wine every night and feeling disgusted with myself every morning. This is what alcoholics call ""research"" -- I was ""researching"" whether I could drink again normally. Alcoholism truly iss cunning, baffling, and powerful.

The difficult part was that I had spent so many years sober and knew exactly how wonderful it was. (And knew exactly all the lies I was telling myself.) But I just didn't have the desire to stop drinking again. I knew in my heart that I NEEDED to stop, but I simply didn't WANT to.

It took me almost 20 years to finally WANT to stop drinking again, and I am so grateful that that day came on April 1, 2022!

Wondering whether you can or should drink again or if you can control your drinking after months or even years of sobriety is a normal thought process of alcoholism. At some point, we all wish we could control our drinking so that we could go out and ""have fun"" and ""socialize"" the way we used to.

But we have to remember the end of our drinking and where drinking took us: We really weren't having fun. We were feeling disgusted with ourselves and blacking out. Wee were ruining our health. We were driving drunk. We weren't taking care of the people and responsibilities in our lives that needed us most.

I'm gratefully sober again and truly believe that this alcoholic cannot drink normally. Not drinking a day at a time is so much easier than picking up that first drink.

I have learned that it is really easy to start drinking again but there is never a promise that I will be able to get sober again or even WANT to before it is too late. (This is what scares me most.) So although Feb. 4 is no longer my sobriety date, I recognize it every year with gratitude for what I've learned and what I can share with other Alcoholics.

Not drinking a day at a time is a gift that I am actively grateful for every single day. When I focus on gratitude, it helps me to not want to drink because I am focusing on how amazing my life is and how good I feel by simply not drinking.

I still have those nine years of sobriety to draw on and I draw on them daily. But all any of us really has is THIS MOMENT and THIS DAY OF SOBRIETY. There is no guarantee of a sober day tomorrow. But the odds are ever in our favor if we wake up, one day at a time, feel grateful for the daily reprieve sobrieety, make a decision to not drink that day, and do everything in our power to stick with that promise to ourselves.

Sobriety is a beautiful thing! And there is power in this group to help us along our path. Thank you everyone for being here and for sharing your journey with us. ODAAT IWNDWYT

**TL;DR:**  
I got sober at 24 and stayed sober for nine years. I eventually tested whether I could drink normally and that single, unplanned beer turned into nearly 20 years of progressive drinking. What started controlled ended in daily, heavy drinking and deep self-disgust. I knew sobriety was better, but I didn’t want to stop until April 1, 2022.

I’m sober again and deeply grateful. I’ve learned that I cannot drink normally, that starting again is easy but stopping again is never guaranteed, and that not drinking one day at a time is far easier than taking the first drink. Gratitude keeps me sober. All we have is today. ODAAT. IWNDWYT.",189,1770224039.0,stopdrinking,31,1.0,False

You’ve been there. The listing looked perfect. The photos were crisp, the reviews glowing. But somewhere between booking confirmation and key handoff, something shifts. The responses get slower. The tone changes. By the time you arrive, you sense it: this host is stretched thin.

At **Llivo**, we’ve noticed a pattern most travel platforms ignore. Guests don’t just rent spaces—they absorb the emotional state of the people hosting them. And when hosts take on too much, guests pay a price that never shows up on the invoice. Unlike platforms that prioritize volume, Llivo operates on a **simple and transparent model**: hosts pay a **12% fee**, and **guests pay no platform fees at all**, keeping the experience fair and human on both sides. You can see how this philosophy shapes our approach at [Llivo](https://www.llivo.com/).



https://preview.redd.it/nh8ybr1mbihg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3db83f007fda5caf21bce3595b2c69d3942842e

# The Delayed Response That Speaks Volumes

It starts small. A booking request sits unanswered for hours. A question about early check-in gets a clipped “sorry, no.”

Guests experience this as uncertainty, not rudeness. They refresh their inbox. They wonder if the reservation is secure. They start planning backup options mentally, eroding the calm that should precede a vacation.

What’s really happening is often invisible. The host may be managing multiple properties simultaneously or balancing hosting with a full-time job alongside their **short-term rental**. They’re not ignoring you—they’re overwhelmed. But guests feel the gap as unreliability, even when intentions are good.

This is the hidden cost of volume-based hosting. When platforms reward more listings instead of sustainable ones, trust in travel becomes the first casualty.



# The Check-In That Feels Like an Interruption

You’ve landed. You’re tired, navigating a new city, and you message your host: *“We’re about 20 minutes away.”*

The reply comes quickly this time, but it’s different—apologetic, scattered, maybe with the wrong door code or a rushed voice note. You arrive to find towels still in the dryer or the host themselves looking harried, juggling keys and phone calls.

Guests feel this as a disconnection. The space may be clean and functional, but the energy is off. You’re not welcomed—you’re processed.

At Llivo, we’ve observed that smooth arrival isn’t just about logistics. It’s about the host’s capacity to be present. When hosts are overextended, they lose the ability to offer the small reassurances that transform a transaction into a true **vacation rental experience**—a local coffee tip, a calm check-in, or a genuine “how was your flight?” This is also why travel safety and clarity matter so deeply to guests, especially during arrival, as outlined in our [Travel Safety](https://www.llivo.com/p/travel-safety) guidance.



# The Silence Between Booking and Arrival

Here’s something guests rarely articulate but consistently feel: the quiet dread of abandonment.

You booked weeks ago. Since then, radio silence. No check-in details. No reassurance. You send a message, receive a brief reply, then nothing again. You start wondering if the place even exists.

This isn’t poor service—it’s misaligned hosting. The host optimized for bookings, not for the **guest experience**. They’re reactive, not relational. Guests, sensing this, arrive guarded, already preparing for disappointment.

The irony is that these hosts are often well-intentioned. They’re simply operating inside systems that reward occupancy over care. When platforms push constant growth, something has to give—and it’s usually the guest’s peace of mind.



# The Subtle Signs of Burnout Guests Instinctively Notice

Guests are far more perceptive than hosts realize. They notice:

* Copy-paste replies that lack warmth
* Delayed maintenance that signals “just get through the season.”
* Fully automated check-ins that feel efficient but impersonal

These aren’t failures of hospitality. They’re symptoms of unsustainable hosting. When a host manages too much—or treats hosting as a side hustle, they can’t fully support—guests absorb that stress.

Many guests describe this as *“the Airbnb feeling”*: being one more name in a long conveyor belt. It’s not about price or luxury. It’s about **human-centered hosting versus volume-driven extraction**, something we explore further when helping travelers [discover better-aligned rentals](https://www.llivo.com/p/discover-best-rentals).

# Why This Matters for the Future of Travel

The short-term rental industry is at a crossroads. Guests are tired of the gamble. They’re not asking for extravagance—they’re asking for reliability, calm stays, and clear communication.

At Llivo, we believe the solution isn’t smarter locks or more automation. It’s **slower, more intentional travel**. It’s the hosts who have the margin to care. It’s platforms that value sustainable hosting over rapid scaling.

When hosts aren’t stretched thin, they can offer what guests actually want: trust. The feeling that someone is genuinely looking out for you—even within a commercial exchange.



# Final Words

If you’ve ever arrived at a rental and felt the host’s exhaustion before you met them, you’ve experienced exactly what this article describes. It’s not imagined. It’s the invisible cost of an industry that forgot hospitality is ultimately about people, not properties.

The best vacation rental experience isn’t the one with the most amenities. It’s the one where you feel seen—where the host has the bandwidth to be present, responsive, and genuinely welcoming.

That’s the standard we’re building toward at **Llivo**: travel that values alignment over algorithms, and hosting that stays human.

i would say i'm quite good at what i do, it just takes a few tries on an unfamiliar machine for me to get used to the pressure of the steam wand. other than that, i'm good to go. 

i had a shift recently where i dialled in the coffee in the morning to their exact recipe. owner tasted and didn't tell me to change anything. the head barista came in and started mumbling to the other staff member, after a while the head barista said ""oh, who dialled in"" and i said me, and she replied ""oh..it's good well done"" which i couldn't tell if it was genuine, but it sure was extremely belittling with the tone that was used. she told me to make her coffee, which i knew was a ""test"" to see my steaming skills. otherwise...wouldn't you make it yourself? i wouldn't tell someone who is here to help out to make me a coffee..lol...

it was really belittling as i was obviously accepted as a freelance barista because my skills match up to the expectations - why try to test and judge my skills when i'm only here for a few hours. they also got annoyed at me for asking for the recipes for other drinks, but i literally never worked in this specific cafe before so how should i know? they would also keep on leaving me alone in the FOH when i don't know how their tills work, their recipes, or anything about their products. they didn't give me a quick tour on where things were - if i needed a restock or where the beans were - nothing. i don't like snooping in cafes that i don't work in, in case i misplace something - and it looks bad to a customer if i look clueless on where things are. 

it was really unprofessional on their part. the conversations with the head barista seemed like a battle of who knew about coffee more. whenever i chimed in on coffee talks, she would kind of shut it down with ""never heard of it"" and walk away...it was really weird. 

i don't know if other freelance baristas feel this way, but i feel like i'm constantly being judged whenever i do a shift somewhere new. only one place gave me a rundown on where things are, recipes, what buttons on the machines to use, and then left me to it. because i obviously know how to make coffee if i am a freelance barista. there is no need to baby or supervise me, because i'm not a new hire being trained.

Last time, we covered the basics, but now we're zooming in on the nuts and bolts: how it actually ticks, why those mysterious .MD files are its secret sauce, and what makes it feel ""alive"" compared to basic chatbots. I've dug deep into docs, GitHub code, expert breakdowns, and community chats to piece this together – no copy-pasting, just distilled insights for everyday users like you.

Think of this as your friendly explainer: We'll break it down step by step, keeping jargon light but details rich. By the end, you'll get why devs call it a ""gateway to real AI agency"" and how you can tweak it safely. Let's crack it open!

# The Big Picture: OpenClaw as Your Local AI Command Center

At its heart, OpenClaw isn't just a chatbot – it's a **local gateway** running on your computer (Mac, Windows, Linux, or even a cheap cloud server like DigitalOcean's $5/month droplet). This gateway acts like a bridge: It links powerful AI brains (from providers like Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's models or Grok) to your everyday tools, files, and apps. You chat with it via familiar platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, or Slack, and it doesn't just reply – it *acts*.

Unlike cloud-only AIs that forget everything after a session, OpenClaw lives on your hardware, keeping data private and persistent. It started as a solo dev's weekend hack in late 2025 but exploded because it solves real pain: Automating boring tasks proactively, remembering your quirks forever, and evolving with community add-ons. No subscriptions needed beyond your AI API costs.

Key tech twist: It's **open-source**, so anyone can inspect or modify the code on GitHub. But under the hood? It's a smart mix of a central server, file-based ""brains,"" and looped thinking that makes it feel autonomous.

# Step 1: The Startup Ritual – How OpenClaw Boots Up and Loads Its ""Mind""

When you fire up OpenClaw (via a simple command like openclaw start after install), it launches a **gateway process** – basically a lightweight server on your machine (usually at localhost:18789). This isn't some fancy cloud thing; it's just a background app that stays running, like a vigilant butler.

Here's the magic sequence:

1. **Config Check**: It reads a main setup file (openclaw.json) for basics like your AI model (e.g., ""claude-3.5-sonnet""), chat app tokens (for logging into Telegram or WhatsApp), and security rules.
2. **Mind Loading**: This is where .MD files shine. OpenClaw scans a workspace folder (usually \~/.openclaw/workspace) for Markdown files (.MD, like simple text notes). These get **concatenated** (mashed together) into a massive ""system prompt"" – the initial instructions fed to the AI model.
   * Why .MD? They're human-readable, easy to edit with any text app (like Notepad), and perfect for structuring info without code. No databases here; just files!
3. **Session Kickoff**: Once loaded, it connects to your chat apps and waits for messages. For groups, it might only respond if mentioned (@OpenClaw); for DMs, it needs pairing approval to avoid spam.
4. **API Hookup**: Every interaction pings your chosen AI (via API key), but with the full context from those files. This keeps responses personalized and consistent.

Pro tip for non-techies: See this reddit for install guides to get you started. 

# The Star of the Show: .MD Files – OpenClaw's Editable ""Brain Cells""

These aren't random notes; they're the core of how OpenClaw thinks and remembers. Imagine giving your AI a personality profile, rulebook, and diary all in plain English. Users and devs rave about them because they're tweakable – edit a file, restart, and boom, your AI evolves.

Common .MD files and what they do:

* **SOUL.md**: Defines the AI's core vibe and boundaries. Example: ""You're Molty, a witty lobster-themed helper. Be concise, helpful, and fun. Never access bank info without explicit ok."" This sets tone and ethics.
* **IDENTITY.md**: Who the AI is to the world. Like: ""I'm OpenClaw, your proactive assistant for productivity. I handle emails, reminders, and web searches.""
* **USER.md**: All about you! ""User is a busy marketer in Toronto who prefers short answers, hates ads, and tracks fitness via Apple Health."" This builds personal context over time.
* **AGENTS.md**: Operating rules, like multi-agent setups. ""Primary agent: Handle chats. Secondary: Monitor stocks and alert on drops."" For teams, this coordinates ""sub-agents.""
* **TOOLS.md**: Lists skills and how to use them. ""Tool: Browser – Search web. Tool: FileWrite – Save notes to disk."" OpenClaw comes with basics (e.g., run shell commands, control browser), but you add more.
* **MEMORY.md**: Long-term storage. Logs key facts from chats, like ""User's birthday: Feb 3; Favorite coffee: Latte."" It grows but gets compacted to avoid bloat.
* **Daily Memory Files** (e.g., 2026-02-03.md): Short-term logs. Today's chats + yesterday's for recency. For ""infinite"" memory, it uses a vector database (fancy search index) to pull relevant old stuff lazily – no loading everything at once, saving costs.

How they work in action: On startup or new sessions, files get bundled into the AI's prompt (e.g., ""System: \[SOUL.md content\] \[USER.md\] ... User: Book a flight.""). Too many? It can ""compact"" sessions by summarizing. Real users report this creates a ""persistent brain"" – tell it your allergies once, and it remembers for meal plans forever.

Downside: Loading big files burns ""tokens"" (AI compute units), so keep them lean. 

# The ""Heartbeat"" Loop: What Makes OpenClaw Proactive and ""Alive""

This is the game-changer – OpenClaw doesn't just react; it *thinks ahead*. The heartbeat is a timed loop (like a smart alarm clock) that wakes the AI periodically, even if you're offline.

* **How it Works**: Set via cron-like schedules or triggers in files (e.g., in TOOLS.md: ""Check emails every hour.""). The gateway runs a background check: ""Any pending tasks? Review memory? Ping user if needed?""
* **Examples**: ""At 7 AM, summarize news."" Or ""Monitor crypto wallet; alert if balance drops 5%."" It uses the loaded .MD context to decide actions autonomously.
* **Tech Underpin**: Built on event loops in Node.js (the code base). For advanced, it ties into ""skills"" – modular add-ons for stuff like GitHub backups or smart home control.
* **Why It Feels Magical**: Unlike Siri, which waits for ""Hey,"" OpenClaw initiates. Experts compare it to early AGI glimpses: It self-improves by writing its own code for new tasks.

But beware: Proactive means potential overreach. Set boundaries in SOUL.md!

# Tools, Skills, and the ""Hands"" That Do the Work

OpenClaw's ""brain"" (AI model + .MD prompts) decides *what* to do, but the ""hands"" execute:

* **Tools**: Built-in actions like browsing (via controlled Chrome), file ops (read/write safely), shell commands (run scripts), or API calls (e.g., to Gmail).
* **Skills**: Community extensions in .MD format (e.g., [SKILL.md](http://SKILL.md) for ""Auto-backup to GitHub""). Install via ClawHub registry – over 100 now, from DevOps to music playlists.
* **Execution Flow**: User asks → Gateway routes to agent → Agent plans (using prompt) → Calls tool → Gateway sandboxes it (limits access to avoid hacks) → Responds.

Security here is key: Runs in isolated ""sandboxes"" (like Docker containers) for risky stuff. Guardrails check permissions via tokens – e.g., ""Allow file write but not delete."" Taint tracking flags dodgy data. Pros warn: Misconfig = risks (e.g., prompt injection leaks), so start sandboxed.

# Security and Guardrails: Keeping the Lobster in Check

OpenClaw's power (full system access) is its risk. Architecture includes:

* **Guardrails**: Between brain and hands – budgets (e.g., no endless loops), approvals (user ok for big actions), audits (logs everything).
* **Pairing**: For chats, approve senders with codes.
* **Sandbox Modes**: Limit to ""read-only"" or quarantine untrusted inputs.
* **Privacy**: Local data, no corp spying – but API shares prompts, so anonymize sensitive info.

Experts call it ""hands for a brain that doesn't exist yet"" – powerful executor, but pair with strong policies.

# Wrapping It Up: Why This Tech Matters for You

OpenClaw's under-the-hood smarts – gateway bridging, .MD-powered prompts, heartbeat proactivity, and modular tools – turn it into a customizable AI employee. For non-techies, it's approachable: Edit files like notes, chat naturally, and watch it automate. But it's raw – bugs, costs, security tweaks needed.

Weve also facetimed a few times and we joke around a lot like it feels easy speaking with him.

We’ve hung out twice so far like once with our friend group and once just the two of us for coffee.

He did mention being busy with work, so maybe that’s all it is. But at the same time, wouldn’t he try to make plans if he was really interested??My friends think that if he liked me, he’d be more proactive about asking me out. I genuinely like him, but I don’t want to waste time if he’s not feeling it. I also don’t want to mess up a potential friendship by misreading the situation.

I said ENOUGH of this, it's not worth my health. 

I decided to do a 7 week check at a walk-in lab, so I still have time to adjust before my three month doctor lab test. I think it's pretty decent looking for 7 weeks, but trigs are a bit high. I don't eat 100% clean, but I DID cut out basically all saturated fat except a small amount from plant based sources. I'm sure the high trigs are from coffee syrup, boxed granola bars, etc. ish.

TC 299 214  (ALMOST normal!!) Should be no higher than 200

LDL 193 130  (WAY too high but it came down so much! Should be under 100. That drop!!!)

HDL 90 53  (good cholesterol, should be 50 or higher. Decreased but still normal). 

TRGS 62 179  (yeah, they went up, should be 150 or below, so not horrid, but did increase).

I'm sure cutting out all remaining refined products would probably knock the trigs down, but I come from a really bad history of eating disorders. Almost died twice from anorexia, so I'm not quite into cutting foods out other than saturated fat, to get cholesterol under control. I've honestly made so much peace turning plant based, with my body and my past ED history. I basically just switched animal foods for a plant protein.   
Oh, on the walk-in lab, they tested Lpa, and it's 21, which they have marked as ""optimal.""

1qvtmw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIbitcheswithtaste/comments/1qvtmw2/money_diaries_33_years_old_make_67k_live_in/,"MONEY DIARIES: 33 years old, make $67k, live in Lakeview, and work fully remote in Digital Marketing.","**Section One: Assets and Debt**

I live fully debt free. I was able to go to college on full scholarships and grant money (thanks to being poor lol) Honestly, I got so much money in grants and scholarships that I had money left over to help pay rent and bills.

**Credit Card debt:** $280 on a personal card and around $700 on a shared credit card with my partner. I pay both off in full every month. I use credit cards for most purchases to earn points and cash back.

**401k:** $9,252. I only started my “big girl job” two years ago, so this is about two years worth of savings. I was contributing very little at first (between 1-3% 

, i know i know), but now I contribute 8%-ish and am hoping to increase that to 10% in a few months.

**HSA:** $1,723. 

**High-yield savings account balance:** $4737. This was at 0 two years ago. My goal is to have this be $10,000 by the end of the year but I’m not feeling confident.

**Checking account balance:** $0 but I get paid tomorrow $1,666! Most of this will go to my savings. I do that thing that people don’t like, where I stash all of my money in my savings account and then pull money out when I need to pay rent, a CC bill, etc. Any insight on to why i should not be doing this? I don’t know why I do it, I just do.

**Section Two: Income**

**Income Progression:** I’ve been in my field for three years. I started as an intern making $20 an hour with no benefits for one year. I was then hired full-time with a starting salary of $60k.

I spent most of my adult life working customer service jobs and didn’t go to college until my late 20s, so I feel like I got a bit of a late start. I was used to living paycheck to paycheck with no benefits. While I do wish I made more, I get unlimited PTO and take between 30–45 days off per year, which helps balance things out 😂 I’m also due for another raise over the summer.

**Main Job Monthly Take-Home:**

After all deductions (taxes, insurance, 401k, HSA, etc.), I take home **$3,332 per month**. I’m paid biweekly.

**Side Gig Monthly Take-Home:**

None.

**Any Other Monthly Income:**

None. I do occasionally withdraw from savings, especially in months with higher expenses. But also I dump all of my paychecks into my savings account. I know I need to stop doing this, I’m just not sure how or why it matters..

**Section Three: Expenses**

**Rent:** $1,100 per month. I live in a two-bedroom apartment that I split with my partner. Gas and wifi are both included in my building.

**Renters Insurance:** $100 per year.

**Electric:** About $40 per month in the winter and $80 per month in the summer. I pay this expense in full and don’t charge my partner. I make $10k more than him now, but for most of our relationship he made much more than me and would always cover electric. this is my way of thanking him! 

**Retirement (401k):** $400 per month.

**HSA:** $100 per month.

**Phone Bill:** $78 per month.

**Fitness Membership:** $100 per month.

**Subscriptions:** None. I use my family’s Amazon video account and rarely watch TV. If I do, I borrow DVDs from the library or find pirated streams online.

**Car Payment:** I don’t have a car, which saves me a significant amount of money.

**CTA:** When it’s warmer, I usually buy a monthly pass for $75. During colder months, I rely on day passes as needed.

**Music Box Membership:** $50 per year.

**Art Institute Membership:** $80 per year.

**Personal Credit Card:** I typically spend $300–$400 per month and pay it off in full. This includes my phone bill, fitness membership, electric bill, and discretionary spending like coffee, movies, thrifting, and small online purchases. I’m actively working on cutting back on impulse spending so I can prioritize saving. For example, I recently cut up and threw away my physical card and deleted this card from my apple wallet.

**Target Credit Card:** This card is used for household essentials and is split evenly with my partner. Total spending is usually around $300 per month, so my share is about $150. I’ve tried to cut this back but I truly can’t. Hand soap, shampoo, body wash, toilet paper, paper towels, dish soap, cleaning products, laundry detergent, floss, etc really add up.

**Shared Credit Card:** We put all shared expenses on this card, including groceries, pet expenses (cat food and litter), movies and activities we do together, dining out, and occasional travel. My portion is **typically around $1,000 per month**, with roughly half of that going toward groceries, as we eat most of our meals at home and prioritize cooking and eating well. This year so far has been slightly higher than usual due to travel for two out-of-state weddings that required flights and accommodations. Outside of those months, spending is more consistent. 

**Pet Expenses:** Around $800 per year for both pets’ annual checkups, split evenly with my partner, so my share is about $400 per year. I love my cats but they are SO expensive lol

**Reflection**

Saving is a priority for me, even though things feel tighter right now. This year included several one-time expenses, particularly travel for two out-of-state weddings, that temporarily limited how much I was able to save month to month. Now that those expenses are behind me, I’m focused on rebuilding my savings and being more intentional with discretionary spending, even though it’s still a work in progress.

I try to balance saving with occasionally “treating myself,” like meeting friends for coffee or grabbing fast-casual food, while generally avoiding sit-down restaurants and takeout. I often say no to events or shopping to stay within my budget, which can feel limiting at times, but living below my means is important to me. I’ll still never turn down thrifting or window shopping! I’m good at telling myself ‘no’ and don’t really struggle with impulse purchasing like I used to. I’m prioritizing spending on things that align with my values, including supporting local businesses when I do go out.

The last 7 days I’ve spent money on:

\-A pair of used yoga pants from depop \~$30

\-A new tube of tretinoin \~$100 (im going to start ordering from Alldaychemist to save $$! bc this is not sustainable lol) a tube will last me 4-5 months. I used my HSA to pay for this.

\-Lunch out yesterday \~$15

\-Breakfast sandwich and a coffee with a friend \~$18

This will likely be my only ‘treat yourself’ expenses for the week! Eating out twice in 1 week is a lot for me. I probably didn’t need that lunch out yesterday but it made me happy.

I love adding strong flavors to accent beef chilis. Like brown sugar or maple syrup or chocolate or cinnamon. For deglazing a bourbon or roast coffee or dark beer. For acid some apple cider or red wine vinegar or lime and lime zest. 

When cooking I like to combine these flavors together. But when tasting they often conflict or, worse yet, collapse into a muddle. 

Hope to hear how others balance out flavors. Do you just stick to one or two? or, Are there rules or principles you follow to mix them together? 

Also, do some of these accents belong with particular chilis? Like, what works best with Serrano or jalapeño ? and what goes better with cayenne or tabascos? or with a smokier peppers base like anchos?

1qvtjgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1qvtjgc/feeling_helpless_and_terrified/,Feeling helpless and terrified,"I’ve started suffering from dysphasia and shortness of breath completely out of the blue. it started with feeling like I was choking when I swallowed a sandwhich a bit too quickly and then happened randomly a few times after this but I tried to ignore it. then I got a really bad attack after taking a pseudoefidrine tablet which I ended up going to the ER for even though I was feeling a bit better in the morning. the doctor gave me nexium and sent me on my way. 

However, once I started taking the nexium my symptoms got 100x worse. the swallowing, which wasn’t so bad, got so bad that I could barely swallow anything but liquids. I also had terrible anxiety and panic attacks plus symptoms of actual heartburn started including globus sensation. after one week of this I decided to stop because I couldn’t take how much worse my symptoms had gotten. However, since getting off them my symptoms have barely improved and now I also have neck pain and tightness, pain in the middle of the back, constant globus feeling. I was starting to eat mushy foods but suddenly had a relapse where I’m convinced the food is getting stuck now around the top of my throat, although I never gag or feel like it went into my lungs. I’m living in another country by myself and this whole experience has been one of the worst things in my life. I live alone and now the fear of choking and in general not being able to eat is taking over my life. I’m only 30 and generally a pretty healthy person, I don’t drink coffee and only alcohol occasionally (although not any more). I’ve tried changing my diet and raising my pillow with zero effect. I can’t understand how suddenly one day I can’t swallow anymore. the doctors here don’t seem to care and because it’s in a different language it’s hard to advocate for myself. I have a barium swallow test coming up so I hope that gives me answers. Any advice or support would be welcome. I’m deeply considering moving back to my home country due to all this, I simply can’t take doing this all alone.

Every weekday felt the same. Wake up tired, commute half-asleep, sit in front of a screen all day, then go home completely drained. I cared a lot at first, probably too much. I took responsibility seriously, stressed over deadlines, worried about results. But over time it became pretty clear that all that effort wasn’t turning into better pay or more control over my life. It mostly just meant the company made more money and my boss looked good.

At some point I stopped pushing myself so hard. I did what was required, nothing more. Not surprisingly, that turned into me being labeled not motivated enough. Two years ago there was a round of layoffs, and I was on the list. Weirdly, I remember feeling relieved more than angry. Like, okay, now I have to think about how to make money for myself instead of waiting for permission.

At first I just wanted to rest, so I took random offline part-time jobs. Coffee shop shifts, helping out at a small retail store. In some ways it felt similar to office work, but also very different. The work was physical and concrete. You do a task, it’s done. No endless meetings, no pretending to be busy. I went home tired, but my brain was quiet. Still, I knew that kind of work wasn’t something I could rely on long term.

Eventually I tried to do something on my own with low risk. Since my background was in ecommerce, I went back to that. The process was actually pretty straightforward: product research, use tools like genstore building sites, finding suppliers, running ads, handling orders. Nothing glamorous. Having prior experience helped, and I started making money faster than I expected.

Now my days look very different. I work from home maybe four hours a day. I cook most of my meals, exercise regularly, meet friends on weekdays, and sometimes travel without asking anyone for approval. Health-wise and mentally, I’m in a much better place than I ever was at my old job.

That said, this kind of work has its own limits too. Income can be unstable, and you’re still tied to screens and platforms in different ways. So I’m curious about other paths.

For people here who’ve escaped traditional jobs, what kind of work gave you the most freedom? Doesn’t have to be perfect or passive, just something where you’re mostly working for yourself and not stuck in an office all day. I’d love to hear real stories and maybe get some new ideas.",5,1770223242.0,antiwork,8,0.86,False

Deadlines everywhere, everyone stressed, my phone exploding, I swear some people are trying to get to me even through good old sms. 

This year I did this rush from Lisbon for the first time.

But what I didn't expect was that instead of bureaucracy problems, I’ve struggled with loneliness actually. Back in London I'd at least suffer with other people. Like, grabbing a coffee, complaining about the workload, feeling like we're all in it together. Here it's just me, my laptop, and a Portuguese cafe owner who doesn't understand why I look so stressed in January.

Another thing is that clients still assume I'm less available because I'm away. Just call me and see that I’m NOT actually on holiday, I’m working!!

Got through it. Not sure if it was easier or harder than London, maybe just different.
