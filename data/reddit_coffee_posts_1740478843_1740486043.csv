They don’t tell you about the weight.

Not the weight of the scrubs or the stethoscope pressing grooves into your neck, not the weight of the chart clipped to your trembling fingers, not the weight of the ECG stickers that never quite come off.

I mean the weight of the ones we carry. The ones who don’t walk out.

You go in thinking about saving lives, not how it feels to hold one down, to press the full force of your body into their ribs, knowing each compression could crack them like dry branches, but if you stop, if you hesitate - 
they won’t come back.

There’s no music in a code blue, no slow-motion Hollywood drama. Just a flurry of hands and voices that don’t match their faces, a language of urgency spoken in half-broken commands, shouted across sterile air. “Push epi! More compressions! Clear!”
And then the quiet that follows when it’s over, the only sound left is the hum of fluorescent lights and the beeping of machines that don’t need to beep anymore.

You tell yourself you’re fine.

You don’t have time to grieve a stranger, not when the next call bell is already blinking, not when room 306 needs pain meds and the woman in 214 is sundowning again, and if you let yourself feel it all, let yourself drown in every last heartbeat that flickered and failed under your hands,
you’ll never be able to clock back in.

So you carry them instead.

The man with the wedding ring, his wife’s voice still echoing in the hallway.
The girl who shouldn’t have been there, her chart too thin for her age.
The hands you’ve held until they went cold, the last breaths you’ve witnessed in the spaces between chest compressions, in the pauses that feel too long, in the moments where the monitor stills and someone says, “Time of death.”

And even when your hands are clean, even when your scrubs are fresh, even when the hospital doors slide shut behind you and the world outside doesn’t know what you’ve just done - 
they stay with you.

You laugh with your friends, fold laundry, sip your coffee.
But sometimes, the smell of saline pulls you back.
Sometimes, the sound of a dropped glass makes your chest tighten like you’re back in the room, waiting for the rhythm to return.

And no one sees it. No one asks.

Because you were built for this, right? Because you signed up for it. Because heroes don’t break.

But we do. Quietly. In the spaces between shifts, in the seconds before sleep.

Not in dramatic collapses, but in the subtle ways we learn to carry the weight - 
of the ones we saved,
and the ones we couldn’t.

1ixtn8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kafka/comments/1ixtn8b/joe_k_part_8/,Joe K - Part 8,"The future came to K about a week later, when he was summoned to attend an interview at the police station. After signing in, he was lead to the same interview room as before. Ohm was unable to attend, for unspecified health reasons, but he'd sent a replacement. ""Hi Joe,"" said a petit woman with long blue hair.

""Hi Roni, if that *is* you. I might have to ask you some security questions.""

""Go ahead, but be gentle with me, I could break down under interrogation.""

""What's the real colour of your hair?""

""There is no real colour, Joe, there's no real anything. This is all a dream, it's whatever colour your subconscious wants it to be.""

""My subconscious doesn't want to be here... nothing personal, of course. Any idea what this is about?""

""As your temporary legal representative, I would advise myself to say 'no comment', but, as a projection of your subconscious mind, I might as well tell you to expect good news."" A knock on the door was followed, exactly three seconds later, by the entrance of Chief Inspector Dee and a woman in a white blouse, black pencil skirt and mid-length heels. She had pale skin and long brown hair with a severe fringe. The only greeting she gave was a non-committal half-smile delivered to the space between K and Veronica.

""Sorry to keep you waiting, this is Sarah, she's from our..."" the chief inspector was cut short by Sarah's almost imperceptible sideways glance. ""*The*... *Independent* Police Complaints Authority and is here in a purely observational capacity."" They sat down while Veronica gave Joe a very perceptible sideways glance and a smile to go with it. ""OK, let's get this over with... sorry, I mean, let's... sorry..."" Sarah handed him an A5-sized piece of white card. After taking a few seconds to compose himself he read quickly, like a shy, nervous child delivering a speech to the school assembly. ""Mr K, on behalf of my department, and the force in general, I would like to apologise for the conduct of one of my officers during your arrest. We, in the police, expect nothing but the very highest standards of behaviour from our officers, and on this occasion those standards were not met, and for that we apologise. Following a thorough internal investigation, we have concluded that the language used by the officer in question was completely unacceptable and can assure you that disciplinary measures have been taken. We hope that you will accept our most sincere apologies and that we can put this whole unfortunate business behind us."" Although he'd managed to plough through the prepared statement efficiently enough, Chief Inspector Dee was clearly not a man at ease with another persons words coming out of his mouth.

In spite of all eyes being on him, it took a while for K to realise that everyone was waiting for him to speak. ""You mean... I'm no longer under arrest?""

""Of course you're under arrest. Really, Mr K, you've had two weeks to familiarise yourself with your case and you're still as ignorant as..."" Those almost imperceptible sideways glances from Sarah were so skilfully rendered that K would later wonder if it was part of her training, and how much practice they took to master. At this moment, though, he was too busy trying to master his own emotions, without the underappreciated help the chief inspector was getting to master his. In the end they both gave in.

""Then why am I here?""

""Were you not listening? to... 'put this whole unfortunate business behind us'. Womble's been suspended and arrested, and you're also getting half your books back... if you 'accept our most sincere apologies' that is.""

""Wait, he's been arrested?""

""Of course he has, there's no room in the modern police force, or anywhere else, for such outdated attitudes."" He looked at Sarah, as if expecting a pat on the back.

""But that seems a bit extreme, couldn't you just... I don't know, have a word.""

""Have a word! Have a word! Then what would people say? I'll tell you what they'd say, they'd say 'they're a law unto themselves, that lot', that's what they'd say. Well that's not how we do things around here, not any more. Nobody is above the law, Mr K. Now, do we have a deal?"" That now familiar feeling of bewilderment and utter helplessness descended over K again. Would there be no end to this madness?

""I sup...""

""May I have a word with my client?"" Leaning in so close that her breath sensitively tickled his ear, making him blush and sheepishly glance up at Dee's smirk and Sarah's poker face, Veronica whispered, ""fancy a haggle?"" How could he refuse such a offer? She sat back and looked straight up at the chief inspector with the confrontational pose of a seasoned size-discrepancy veteran. ""He wants all his books back.""

""My hands are tied, this department is no longer handling the investigation...60% is the best I can do.""

""95 - do I have to remind you exactly why *your* department is no longer handling the investigation?"" Another signature move from subtle Sarah.

""65.""

""90""

""...70.""

""85.""

""...75.""

""80.""

""75 is the best I can do, Miss...

""Miss mind-your-own-business - 80%, and another apology, or we walk. What *would* people say?"" Dee looked like his head was about to explode, but he managed to keep his cool.

""Deal. Mr K, we're sorry."" He concluded the negotiation and received a form from Sarah that he passed over to K. ""Sign this,"" he said and added under his breath - ""If you can remember who you are, this time.""

Outside the station, a fiery Veronica jumped up and down and threw her bony arms around K's bony neck, while his own bony arms remained pinned, stubbornly, to his bony sides. ""We did it!"" she shouted.

""Did what? I'm still under arrest. And now someone else is.""

""Are you crazy? you've got 80% of your books back, that's a great result.""

""They've still got 20%, and they're *my* books."" K was in no mood to celebrate the small victory. The guilt he felt about Inspector Womble's arrest concealed itself in a surly bitterness directed at the person whose, admittedly offhand, remark about expecting good news had misled him into believing that the whole affair was finally about to reach a satisfactory conclusion.

""A little gratitude wouldn't go amiss, you know."" Veronica was right and K knew it. He regretted his outburst and felt ashamed of his childish behaviour. Now he had two reasons to feel guilty, but he could only apologise for one of them.

""I'm sorry, Roni, and thank you - getting those books back means a lot to me. And you were great in there,"" he said, with a smile that attempted to add a flirtatious, reconciliatory, spin to the apology but probably just came off as a bit awkward. Either way or regardless, the gesture was effortlessly reciprocated.

""I was, wasn't I? Did you see the way I intimidated the chief inspector? I'm going to make a great lawyer, just wait until I get in that courtroom, there'll be...""

""Wait, am I going to court?"" After all the crazy mental gymnastics of the past few weeks, K found himself spontaneously voicing the ultimate fear lurking at the back of his mind - the trial. It was a fear that Veronica dismissed with one blow, like a ninja assassin.

""Are you kidding? The way your case is going, you're never going to court. You should celebrate.""

""Care to join me?"" he causally let out, as if it was something he did all the time, then immediately started panicking. What the hell am I going to talk about with a young woman half my age? I've got no real interest in her life and I don't have one - are we going to sit there and compare centuries? Maybe she read his mind and decided to show mercy, or maybe she was thinking exactly the same thing, or maybe she was completely repulsed by the idea of spending any more time with him than was absolutely necessary... or maybe she really did have to get back to the office.

""...I might be able to give you a lift though, where do you want to go?""

""Uh... the Black Bottom,"" he said, because he didn't want to say 'home', and it was the first place he thought of. Before they left, she took a selfie of them both in front of the police station to commemorate the victory. Then she took another. Then she took several more until she was happy that K looked happy enough. Then she took several more until she was happy that she looked pretty enough. Then she took one where you could see enough of the sign to tell it was the police station and said she'd photo-shop the three of them together later to make sure she really captured the moment. By the end of the process, K was certain that the thin man in the grey hooded top, over the other side of the road was looking at them.

Veronica refused to believe the old coffee house even existed, while pointing out all the ""better"" alternatives that *were* on her google maps. As a non-driver, K's directions were sketchy, at best. He had no knowledge of the one-way system and couldn't tell a road from a walkway, but Veronica didn't seem to mind the extra trouble and even received a little Proustian rush when they finally did arrive at their destination.

""Oh, I remember this place, we drifted over here a few times when we were kids. Didn't it used to be a pub called... The Starry Night, or something? We'd knock on the window and pull faces at the old Irishman behind the bar, and he'd come running out, shouting - 'Get out of here, you fucking munchkins.'"" She nailed the generic accent so perfectly that K could almost visualise Ulysses Rheaney shaking his fist in the doorway.

""He died of a heart-attack a few years ago,"" he said.

""Well, don't blame me, we were only kids.""

Feeling the need to thank Veronica for both the overextended lift and, again, for the imminent return of his books, he offered to buy her a coffee, but was secretly relieved when she declined, giving him the opportunity to skip going in at all and head straight home instead. You never know, he thought, my books might already be waiting for me. He walked as slowly as he thought a healthy fifty-year-old man could reasonably be seen doing, hoping she would drive away, but the sound he was waiting for never reached his ears. Two feet from the entrance, he turned around. She was on her phone, apparently in no particular hurry. ""I thought you had to get back to the office,"" he fumed, under his breath. There was no avoiding taking the whole pointless ruse all the way to its conclusion. Trying not to look around, he made straight for the counter.

""He's not here,"" said Ma. K was taken aback - being remembered was something that used to happen, and he was still struggling to adjust to its recent comeback.

""Are you sure he's not in the shadows somewhere?""

""I wouldn't worry about him, he might get a little overexcited sometimes but he's harmless enough, that one. I'm not so sure about the other company you've been keeping, though. Black, no sugar, is it? or an Amerikano as they call it these days?""

""Either one... thanks.""

""Anything to eat? - they call that up-selling, I went on a course, once.""

""No thanks... Ma.""

""I should ask for my money back.""

""Amerikanos and up-selling? didn't I see you on *The Apprentice*?""

""No, it was *Dragon's Den*, Deborah Median bought 50% of this place, so I bought a signed picture of Max Roach to drum up business. As you can see, it worked. Grab yourself a seat, I'll bring it on over."" Since the place was empty, K walked around, looking at the photographs and found he could identify about half. He had a small collection of classic jazz albums at home, but nothing to play them on for years. Unexpectedly sinking into the blues, staring at the eponymous picture in the Thelonious Monk booth, K was only brought back to Earth by the sudden appearance of Ma, bearing two mugs of coffee. ""He's more at home here than any of the others, don't you think? 'The Van Gogh of Jazz,' da used to call him. You suddenly look like you want to be alone but is it alright if I join you?""

""'It's alright, Ma... I'm only sighing.'""

""In that case you're in luck, this week's special offer is a free therapy session with every cup of coffee,"" she said, sitting opposite him. ""Go on, I won't judge.""

""That's a relief, it feels like everyone else is. I've been arrested and it feels like I'm already on trial, but I don't even know what it's all about.""

""Oh, that's easy, all trials are about the same thing. For instance, there was this one trial in Italy about 400 years ago. Now, folk didn't know much about space back in them days, and they had what they called the Ptolemaic System. It was your basic geocentric system, with the Earth at the centre of the universe, and it made perfect sense - man was God's masterpiece and Earth was man's home so why the fuck wouldn't He put it in the middle, right? And, you must admit, it does look that way, if you don't pay too much attention. But then, in the middle of the sixteenth century, this Polish fella comes along and starts paying too much attention. His name was Copernicus, and he had a good old look at space and said - 'I don't buy it. It seems to me, from my observations, that the Earth is not the centre of the universe, the Sun is.' So he invented a new heliocentric system, which he called the Copernican System, because he thought it was a great discovery and he wanted folk to associate his name with something clever. Unfortunately, everyone thought he was nuts and started telling jokes about him, like - 'A man walks into a pub with his shoes on his head, and the barman says why are you dressed like that, and the man says I'm using the new Copernican System', stuff like that. Then, about sixty or seventy years later, when everyone else had forgotten the crazy old Polish fella, this other fella, a real smart fella, thought the crazy old Polish fella might not be so crazy, after all. His name was Galileo and he said - 'Check this out, I've invented this thing called a telescope and I've been looking at the moons of Jupiter, and I've been looking at the phases of Venus, and I've definitely not been looking at your sister in the bath, whatever she says, and I think Copernicus was right, I think the Sun *is* the centre of the universe.' Now, when Galileo said something, folk didn't joke, they paid attention, so the catholic church asked him if wouldn't mind not contradicting the word of God so much. And he tried, but you know how hard it is keep a secret? In 1632 he published a book called *Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems* which was as much of a dialogue as this is, and nobody was falling for it, least of all the Roman Inquisition. Galileo was found guilty of heresy and remained under house arrest until he died in 1642. Of course, the trial wasn't just about Galileo verses the catholic church, its implications run much deeper than that.""

""Science verses religion.""

""Deeper than that, even - the truth verses the trial. The truth was defending its right to decide the trial and the trial was defending its right to decide the truth. The trial had home advantage, though, so the truth was held in contempt of court and it hasn't been let back in since.""

""How can you say that? things have changed a bit in the last 400 years. Scientific analysis is used in trials all the time now, it can establish guilt or innocence on it's own.""

""It can, but it's not allowed to. Lawyers still manipulate facts and juries still make ill-informed decisions. It doesn't matter how objective and cutting edge the science is, when the justice system remains ultimately subjective and mired in tradition. With all the advances science has made in the last 400 years, the legal process has barely changed at all, and there's a very good reason for that - man's ego. The laws of nature can never be allowed to be more important than the laws of man. The trial can never be decided by the truth, the truth has to be decided by the trial.""

""I'll bear that in mind, Ma, but I'm not sure how it helps me?""

""Oh, it's all about *you*, isn't it?""

""Well you did say this was therapy.""

""I also said it was free, if you want the Joey-centric system go and pay some bearded cunt to blow pipe-smoke up your arse for an hour. Times up, if you need another session, you'll have to buy another coffee.""

""'It's alright, Ma, I can make it.'""

K made it home, at least, and was relieved to do so, having criss-crossed his way along Kandinsky Street to avoid the zephyrs. As he trudged up the stairwell, he thought, as he always did, of calling on Katie. It was about forty-five minutes before the school closed, so he knew she'd be up and about. She can't still be mad at me, he thought, can she? There was a brief message from Zephyr on his answering machine which, without really paying attention to, he deleted. He'd phoned yesterday too, asking to meet, but K was too afraid to pick up the receiver. Did he have a stalker, now? Maybe he could ask Katie, maybe she would know, maybe she's had a stalker... maybe *he's* Katie's stalker. He didn't feel like a stalker, but they never do, do they?

The door buzzer almost buzzed him out of his skin. His first thought - I've got to answer it, in case it's Katie. His second thought - I can't answer it, in case it's Zephyr. His third thought - it can't be Zephyr, he doesn't know where I live. His fourth thought - does he? He peaked through his blinds and saw a white transit van parked outside, triggering his fifth thought - my books? The lift was in one of its regular out-of-order phases and K's offer of assistance was declined for health and safety reasons, so it took the two men over an hour to carry the thirty-four cardboard boxes, each stamped *APPROVED*, up the stairwell. With barely concealed resentment, they treated him like an inconvenience, but found plenty of time to flirt with Katie when she passed them on the stairs, on her way to pick up Robbie from school.

Each box was opened with a kitchen knife and a hint of ceremony, performed only for himself. Initially checking each cover for damage, this evolved into deeper content dives. There were science books he'd barely understood and history books he'd meant to read again. There were novels he remembered fondly - certain plots, episodes, characters, others he'd forgotten all about and others with memories and past associations still stuck between the pages. From *A Brief History of Time* \- that his mother had given him for his sixteenth birthday, to *A Brief History of Seven Killings* \- one of Quinn and Richard's recommendations in the card that came with last years Christmas tip, they all spoke to him from beneath and beyond their covers. An old bud-smoking buddy had lent him *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* decades ago, and thinking that he was probably a grandfather by now gave him a strangely comforting feeling of intimacy, oxymoronically stretching across space and time, and tinged with regret. He was a good friend, he should've held on to that one... and couple of others. There were less comforting feelings, too, like shame. *The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat* reminded him of the boy who mistook his girlfriend for a jimmy hat. His first lover had lent him that book over thirty years ago, but he had no idea why *The Shape of Things to Come* reminded him of his first snog, and the subsequent emotional intensity that had kept him awake the whole night, and unable to make eye-contact with the girl at all the next day. Could his juvenile attitude and behaviour towards women have been fuelled by the shame of falling in love too easily? In the time and place that K grew up, real men weren't allowed to have feelings - well, apart from lust, that was either compulsory or completely unacceptable, depending on its object. It's funny how a false sense of shame can lead directly to genuinely shameful behaviour. He put some books to one side, determined to have a second, or third, crack at them - Thomas Bernhard's relentlessly repetitive *Extinction*, David Foster Wallace's infinitely tedious *Infinite Jest*, Fernando Pessoa's disquietingly quiet *The Book of Disquiet*, and a history of quantum mechanics that had collapsed his functioning on more than one previous occasion. Next to it, a much bigger pile of books seemed to have grown under its own volition. These were the books whose gravitational fields were still pulling him in, towards forgotten old pleasures and potential new discoveries. There are some friends people want to visit, and some they visit because they feel they should. He was flicking through Anna Kavan's *Ice*, borrowed from another old girlfriend from years gone by, and wondering if she still had his cheap pulp version of *A Canticle for Leibowitz*, when the phone rang again. Expecting Zephyr, he let the answering machine take it. ""Joe?... Bro. Sorry I haven't been in touch, I've been a bit busy, lately. Anyway, there's been an unexpected development and we've had to switch tactics. I'll pick you up at ten in the morning, there's someone I'd like you to meet.""",1,1740485883.0,Kafka,0,1.0,False

This last weekend I went to a let's say ""camp"". There was this girl(she was the organizator of the camp). I will try to be brief so I will jump straight to it. Saturday night I drinked and we ended up only the two of us talking until 6:00 am about our lifes. Right after we were left alone she started hugging my arm, holding at some times my hand and rest her head on my shoulder. At 6:00 we decided to go to sleep and we went to get our things to get ready. Once upstairs she said to me to remember her to get her friends towel. Fast forward we both forgot about the towel and she texted me about it when were already in bed. We talked a bit after that trough text and it ended that she owes me a coffee.

Next day she made me coffee, but it was pretty bad so she suggested me not to drink it. After that we went to a hike, when we arrived at the final point I lay down to sunbathe and after some time she came. We started talking with whom of the group we would go out to drink something. 
After we came back we didn't talk much until we started packing things. When I finished with mine I went to her and asked if she wanted help with her stuff, she said no but I could stay to chat. She complimented how I smell and we talked a bit. When it was time to go we went downstairs and I was walking besides her. Suddenly she turned back, grabbed my chin and asked: ""and, when I will see you again?"". I panicked a bit and said that if she accepts my application for the next camp. She looked at me and said: ""so I am not in the group of people with who you would drink something?"". I said that yes, if it is reciprocal. ""It is"", she said. After that we say goodbye and hugged.(I was leaving before her)
When I arrived at the bus I texted to her saying that it was a pleasure to meet her and if she need something, whatever it is, I am there to help her. She answered with something similar and ended with: now get some rest and relax. I said:""same for you"", ""see you:)"".

Last, I wanted to add that she looked me a lot these two days, she touched me in different ways(maybe I am wrong, she was hugging other people too, but I think it was a little different with me)

This was Sunday, today us Tuesday and no text from her. Maybe I am too impatient, but I just wanted to see what other people think.

1ixtks6,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ixtks6/all_the_substances/,All the substances,"It recently dawned on me— the fact that I am basically using a substance at any given part of the day. Adderall in the morning/ daytime and then alcohol or weed (I live in recreational state) in the evening. Antidepressant before going to bed. 

I have young kids and work full time. If I am unmedicated, my ADHD is either keeping me from doing my job during the day or chilling out/ being present at night. And I have generalized anxiety that plays a big part. 

I don’t feel like my relationship with alcohol is harmful but I would like to limit it for health reasons. And I use weed 1-2 times per week when I am wanting to have a “dry day” (no alcohol). 

Anyone else feel this way? Has anyone thought through this? Is there an innate harm is using these substances as tools? I have mixed feelings. Some people argue that relying on annoying at all is “addiction” and harmful in nature. On the other hand, doesn’t a large majority of Americans drink coffee every morning or eat dessert after a meal?

Smoking is a harmful addiction that affects not only the lungs but also the heart, liver, and overall health. Quitting may seem challenging, but with the right strategies, it is achievable. Here are ten effective ways to quit smoking and lead a healthier life.

1. Set a Clear Goal

Decide why you want to quit smoking. Whether it's for better health, financial savings, or family, having a strong reason keeps you motivated.


---

2. Choose a Quit Date

Pick a specific date to quit smoking and stick to it. Prepare yourself mentally and physically for this change.

3. Use Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)

Nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, and inhalers can help reduce withdrawal symptoms and make quitting easier.

4. Identify Triggers and Avoid Them

Certain situations, like drinking coffee or being around smokers, can trigger cravings. Recognize and avoid these triggers to stay on track.

5. Stay Active and Exercise

Physical activities like walking, yoga, or meditation can help reduce stress and distract you from cravings.

Eating fruits, vegetables, and drinking plenty of water helps detoxify the body and reduces nicotine dependence.

Inform your loved ones about your decision. Their encouragement can help you stay motivated and accountable.

8. Find Healthy Alternatives

Whenever you feel like smoking, chew gum, drink water, or engage in a hobby to keep your hands and mind occupied.

Celebrate small milestones, like a smoke-free week or month, with a reward to keep yourself motivated.

There is a coffee blogger I follow on Threads that posted about coffee ratios specifically for filter style coffees. He reported that he has long held the belief that shorter ratios were better, anywhere from 1:14 down to even 1:10. Needless to say, that got me thinking, especially for decaf. 

Well, I started experimenting, especially on the less premium decaf beans and I think 1:14 even 1:14.5 will make the flavours pop that little more.

1ixtj72,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ixtj72/i_have_had_mysterious_illness_for_9_years_which/,I have had mysterious illness for 9+ years which is causing me to consider getting euthanasia? Does anybody has any clue what it might be?,"


**Background**


I was a pretty normal guy until shortly after my 3rd year in college hit (2016). In that year, I soon noticed myself becoming apathetic to stuff everyone cared about like the popular movies or hanging out with friends/family. At the time I thought it was a phase, but that apathy kept expanding and within a few years (2019) it encompassed my entire life. I'll break it down below (all the symptoms are chronic):


**Symptoms**

*Apathy* - I still feel emotions, but they're 1/10 as strong as they once were. Like they're frozen or trapped in deep ice. Life is basically flat, and compared to the average person I don't feel emotions at all - to the extent of letting my life fall apart because nothing feels important. Any emotion I do feel occurs only once, as a response to new stimuli. Even if I do that same thing again after that, it goes back to feeling like nothing.


*Anhedonia* - Nothing is enjoyable. When I get home from work, I watch youtube or sleep. Doing anything else is expending energy for no return. Everything that used to feel good (talking with people, watching movies, listening to falling rain) is just empty. 


*Reduced sensitivity* - My hearing is like that of an old man. Often people standing right next to me address me and I don't notice because it's so soft I assume they're far away. My sense of smell doesn't work unless I put something right under my nose and inhale very hard. Food tastes like cardboard. Sex feels like always wearing a condom. And strangely I think my eyes see less color than before. This also extends to various drugs - alcohol no longer gives me a buzz (though I still get the lowered inhibitions + spinny room thing). Day and night feel the same.


*Memory loss* - Nearly all my past memories are gone. Details of shows I watched, people I hung out with, games I played, my childhood, it's all gone. Putting new things into memory is also extremely hard (a nightmare for studying).


*Irritability* - This one is weird. I'm just irritable at random times every day. Certain pitches of sound agitate now in a way they never did. This happens with certain speaking voices a lot, and they become really painful to listen to.


*Weight loss* - I was 230 lbs./104 kg. at the start of 2014. By the end, I was 160-170 lbs. or 72-75 kg. This occurred the same time my other symptoms were worsening. The strange part of this I recall is that I put no major effort into losing weight - it simply happened by eating and acting the way I always did. Right now, I think there's some barrier that prevents me from gaining more weight. When I eat more than usual, my stomach is simply totally full and it can stay that way for days.


*Physical irritation* - My stomach feels tight and irritated all the time, and I can only defecate 1-2 times per week, sometimes not at all. When I do it's always painful and difficult, even when I make sure to eat fiber. Also, oddly the temple of my head feels weird and ""blocked"" all the time, like a stone. This is the same region that feels activated when you actually do feel emotions and pleasure, so I'm sure this is important.


*Sleep deprivation* - Any time I get stressed, I lose the ability to sleep altogether. Even small stressors, like college exams, usually cause this. My circadian rhythm also slips quite easily and I've ""inverted"" it by accident many times, waking up at dusk and sleeping at dawn. This never happened before the illness.


*Derealization* - Not to be confused with depersonalization. It's feeling totally removed from your environment. When out in public, I feel like a self-driving car with no driver at the wheel, my body is there but I'm not. 


**Attempted Treatments**

*Counseling* - I saw a church counselor as a teenager, but as you can imagine, it didn't help anything. He kept saying I was in a ""funk"" whereas I thought the problem must be physiological, and since talking about my (mostly nonexistent) emotions didn't do anything, I stopped going and swore off the idea of therapy.


*Antidepressants* - I've taken Sertraline, Bupropion, Nortriptyline, Tranylcypromine, and a host of others (5-6) that I regrettably didn't keep track of. I took all for 4+ weeks and yet none had -any- effects positive or negative save for the Nortriptyline and Tranylcypromine (The NTP gave me dry mouth, the TCP gave me hypotension, but both oddly made me enjoy music more for a week before pooping out). Due to a limited budget and feeling like ADs were a waste of time for me, I've lost hope with them too.


*Supplements* - Lots of vitamins, a multi-vitamin, Betaine HCL, Sarcosine + NAC, NSI-189, Ashwagandha, probably forgetting some others. As you could have predicted, no effect.


*Meditation* - This is an odd one. When all my other emotions stopped working, I started meditating and was shocked that the ""calmness"" accompanying meditation still worked in me, and I thought there was some meaning in that. But a few months later I tried it again and that sensation was gone too, with no return. So I gave up.


*Exercise* - I took up jogging for a few weeks, it seemed to do absolutely nothing so I gave it up. 


*Diet* - I have tried eating healthier on and off but it didn't help. Also, certain healthy foods like chicken upset my stomach on occasion and I have no clue why. My stomach seems to dislike fruit as well - especially bananas. I have no clue why. I often resort to junk food specifically because it feels like it won't upset my stomach. I visited a G.E. who had my bloodwork done but she said everything looked normal.


*Improving my life* - Tried making friends, going to college, getting a job, getting a car, getting a girlfriend. I did all of it. And still felt like crap. 


**Possible Origins**

*#1) Trauma* - When all this disease stuff started, I was 13. By the time it hit rock bottom, I was 17. During that timespan, my family collapsed, and there were awful shouting matches going for hours every day at points. Sadly, the most likely explanation for the disease is that it's a latent problem that was triggered as a result of the stressor: The lasting damage is not due to the ""trauma"" though - it's not PTSD - it merely used the stress as a trigger. Mental illness (particularly addiction) runs through my family too.


*#2) Some weird stomach problem* - There's evidence for this as well. For one, most people in the Anhedonia subreddit never mention stomach problems (they largely get anhedonia from meds -- I never tried an antidepressant until the disease was severe), while stomach issues are a huge factor in my illness. Two, sometimes I'll eat a specific way and have a brief ""window"" where my sense of smell starts working again. For example, last Winter I quit sugar for a month and my sense of smell improved (and went back to baseline soon after). And a month or two ago, I had it again after eating some European chocolates from the store. But again, couldn't replicate it.


*#3) Something dopamine related* - I drink coffee obsessively, because it keeps me from being a complete zombie. Nortriptyline and Tranylcypromine also act on dopamine AFAIK, and they had a positive effect on me, so I believe this is relevant. But it's likely just one facet of the problem - i.e. not the direct cause.


**Conclusions**

Nothing really makes sense. There are no ups or downs like you see in most depression cases, nor feelings of guilt or worthlessness, nor suicidal ideation. So I'm really tempted to reject the depression idea. It feels like there's just some biological trigger I'm missing that's causing all this, but it's too obscure for me to grasp.


If you have any ideas or things that jump out at you, please let me know! This disease has stolen almost half my time on earth now, and will continue stealing more until it is solved. There are a lot of bright minds here, perhaps one of you can spot something. Thanks.",2,1740485496.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1ixth7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1ixth7q/how_can_i_code_every_project_using_oop/,How can I code every project using OOP?,"Hi.

In the past, I have studied Python for 500+ hours and learnt 50 main/key topics exactly. One was object oriented programming. I have a file that named **OOP.ipynb** with 173 cells where I've noted everything about OOP, while I was watching popular YouTube channels like Freecodecamp, Corey Schafer, Python Simplified and etc...

I know what OOP is and how it works.

But this is still isn't enough for me to code a project from scratch using OOP.
Maybe you watched, there is a video in Freecodecamp YT channel that the tutor coded a Blackjack game using OOP. It was awesome but so complicated. Also Angela Yu's Coffee Machine project is one of the best example for OOP in her 100 days of code course. There are 2 more excellent examples that I want to share. Python Simplified's OOP with Pygame and Ork Slayer Gamedev's Text-Based Battle OOP. In some projects, class examples are really simple. There is a simple __init__ and have a few functions. But in some projects class structures are really complex.

When I start coding a project using OOP, some questions come to my mind:

1) Which data must I convert into objects in __init__?
In Blackjack example, tutor had converted each card into objects.

2) How many classes must I create?
In coffee machine example, there was 4 py file and 4 classes.

Could you please give me some advices?
How can I reach a level where I am able to code every project using OOP easily?

I work in the same company as my partner and we also live outside the city.

I have only one hobby left and that my gaming. My own corner I can go to, to switch off my brain. My partner isnt a gamer at all. Doesn't talk about it, mention it in any aspect.
And because of my gaming (something I only do maybe an hour or two every other day now) I am being told that all I do is sit there and never spend quality time with my partner. Which we do.

All other hobbies and interests fell away as soon as we met. Photography, editing, interests in food (because we're always saving money), being active, gym.
I mean, for 7 years I have not gone snowboarding and for the 4 years I've known my partner, I haven't done that because they dont want to. I even cut back on coffee before they dont like the taste when they kiss me.

My partner is a very very good person. They are good hearted, cares and takes care of me when I need it. But also doesnt have the English vocabulary as me. Emotions and communications are very difficult for my partner.

I take part in every single thing that my partner wants.
Going to her family and friends' 3-5 even till 7 hours 'quick' coffee or Sunday Brunch. I also want to note that after 7 year I can still only speak basic words. (Only because I live in that country where people say 'speak our language or get the fuck out.)

I feel isolated, alone, misunderstood and scared for what I am turning into.

I have had depression in the past but this is different.
I dont feel depressed as much energy-wise, but I still want to off myself.
I only refrain from that because I dont want my partner to be alone after I'm gone. That breaks me.

I feel cornered and I dont know what to do anymore.

I will never consider divorce because my family was never brought up that way. But I can't do this anymore. I want out. And I want to point a middle finger to the man upstairs as my lights go out. Nothing has been worth while in this life.",1,1740485212.0,nihilism,0,1.0,False

1ixtdt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fnaftheories/comments/1ixtdt1/micheal_seems_to_heavily_line_up_with_hudson/,Micheal seems to heavily line up with Hudson Fosters backstory from What We Found,"TL: DR: William is Michael's Stepfather and abused him, leading to Michael accidently burning his mother alive.

In the Fazbear Frights story ""What we found"" we meet the Fright guard: Hudson foster, who seems to be very similar to Mihael in many ways.

Just to recap Hudson: Father committed suicide, his Mum remarried a very abusive guy, his mother started neglecting him after becoming addicted to sleeping pills, he got bullied for being malnourished and weak and one day he sets a house on fire to kill his abusive Stepfather, succeeding but accidently killing his Mum in the process.

If we were to put this backstory, or atleast the general idea onto Michael, it actually works really well. In his early life his father died leading to his mother remarrying to William who would be abusive to Michael and who would father his half-siblings, he who shall not be named (HWSNBN) and Elizabeth. His mother would get addicted to pills, leading to Michael being bullied for being weak eventually leading to him attempting to kill William in a fire. Instead, accidently killing his mother. Leading to William starting to kill and Michaels bullying of HWSNBN.

But does this have any other evidence apart from it kind of working? Yes.

In The Immortal and The Restless (TIATR) Vlad goes on and on about how the baby isn't his and he doesn't have any duty to take care of him. This would lead into Vlad and his distresses mistress's house burning down. This should immediately ring bells as this would seem to line up with some of Hudson's backstory. Particularly being the burning house and the father figure not being the son's actual father.

Then we need to go to Midnight Motorist and Help Wanted Two, particularly Fallfest. In help Wanted 2, there are many minigames that seemingly take place in Fallfest 83, with many of said minigames ending in a fire. In Midnight Motorist, there is the dirt pile, something every theorist collectively hates. But one thing many people don't mention in the outline in the dirt around the whole moveable area, which would seem to either be the outline of a building - either once there or planned to be there or the remnants of where a barrier may be. Such as, a fence line inclosing a traveling carnival in the middle of the forest.

===

So, adding this all together: At a young age, Michael lost his father to suicide, leading for his mother (we'll call her Clara) to remarry to a man named William. William would not care for Michael, abusing him not considering his son. This would Michael some serious issues already.

William would have two children with Clara, Michael's half-siblings, HWSNBN and Elizabeth. The manipulation from William's part would lead Clara to take up pills, leading to her neglecting Michael. This would lead into Michael being bullied as a kid for malnourishment. The bullying Michael delt with would surface as him Bullying his half-brother, a common thing that makes bully's become bully's.

William's abuse would become too much for Michael, who would attempt to kill him by burning him during Fallfest 83'. This failed to kill him but succeeded in killing Clara instead. After Fallfest was cancelled, William would bury Clara in a mound in the very location she died.

This sent William over the edge who would one night go out and murder his business partner's daughter, Charlotte. Michael would keep bullying HWSNBN even more after his manslaughter of his mother. (I don't think Michael was ever actually found guilty for the fire). Ofc, this would lead into The Big Bite.

===

This gives us answers to Midnight Motorist, Fallfest 83' and Michael's reasoning for bullying HWSNBN.

But didn't I say this also leads back to LadyFiszi?... yeah, it does.

Before the accusations (which I'm actually not sure were proven or not), Scott got her to create a very interesting image simply titled: Hallway and Boy. In it, he sees an older looking house with several familiar looking items, a baby doll resembling a Bidybab, a clock resembling Moon and a portrait of a Woman resembling Ballora (presumably Clara/Mrs Afton). It also features a smashed coffee mug. Though in the right, there's a separate image of a Boy in seemingly old clothes and a dark room. This adds onto the idea that William abused Michael. The Boy is greyed out with hidden eyes, and seemingly every sad and/or depressed. Plus, he's in a dark room with wooden floors, which could possibly mean William would frequently lock Michael in a dark room, probably the basement or something similar when he messed up, in this case dropping a Coffee mug.

===

I would like to add some potential issues in this theory, there's isn't many, but it would be disingenuous to not include them.

\- In this, Clara and The baby would seemingly both represent Michael in TIATR.

\- Scott may not want to still include any lore that was presented by LadyFiszi.

\- Michael is very often said to look extremely similar to William, which would be weird if they weren't closely related",0,1740484969.0,fnaftheories,5,0.33,False

My little one is 14 months old. A few weeks after he turned 12 months he was showing signs for one nap transition. Now, I will say - he has been doing EMW for months prior to this which I tried really hard to fix but it just never got any better. So I decided to try the transition and I actually worked with a sleep consultant to get there. Her advice was to give him 5h WW before and after his nap. He wakes anywhere between 5 am to 5:45am so that first nap was never at a consistent time.. sometimes at 10, sometimes 10:30 etc etc. So her advice was to continue to stretch the first wake window closer to 11..11:30…until I finally get to 12pm nap. And the idea was everything would shift…bedtime would shift out later with the later nap and his wakes in the morning would shift. It’s been 5 weeks now we’ve been working at this so yesterday I said let’s push to 12 today for the first time. He woke up at 5:30, he had a Power Nap of 15 mins while I had to run an errand at 9:10-9:25 am as he fell asleep in the car. I put him down for his nap at 12 and he slept until 2:50. Gave him 5h with after that and had him asleep in bed by 8pm. We had our first split night. He was up at 12 and wouldn’t sleep until 2. Then he was up for the day 5:45. 

I need this dumbed down for me. I think I have read every post on here about early morning wakes. Everyone says you need to push bedtime. Ok fine - but how am I pushing bedtime if his awake time in the morning is fluctuating in the mornings, that first wake window is all over the place depending on when he wakes. Also how am I pushing the nap and bedtime without getting him tired and getting a split night? For example say 1 let’s say he wakes up at 5:30 and nap 1 is at 11, that’s 5.5 WW. Then day 2 he wakes up at 5:15 and nap is at 11, that’s pushing him 5.45WW which doesn’t sound like a lot but seems to be. 

I’ve tried a few two nap days he actually sleeps less.. usually hour the first nap and 45 mins the second so I don’t feel like they are great “resets” for him

Pls share your advice on what I can do to fix this one nap schedule. DWT is 6:30-7. ",1,1740484719.0,sleeptrain,1,1.0,False

Celebrity tours differ from regular tours. I as a normal person wait in the fast pass line. If it’s half an hour. You wait. There are certain rides that have a vip+ experience for normal tours where you go in the exit. Celebrities that can cause a safety concern experience a different tour because of - safety. Caroline is getting the normal everyday tour that anybody can book. 

If you want the good seats for soarin or flight of passage - you wait. 

When a ride breaks down - it’s broken down for you too. 

Basically her perks are lightening lanes, private transport, the guide will push the stroller. They aid in maximizing your time. The average tour is 7 hours with the option to extend to 10 - though 7 hours of go go go is a lot. A normal tour you aren’t gonna want to stop for sit down dining. You also go into the park from backlot. There’s also viewing for parades, fireworks and they can help you get reservations at restaurants after tour. (They can cancel them for you too). They also have access to merch? One of our guides hunted down a pin that fell off my kids backpack. We had to buy it again but it was in the store at our hotel. 

If it’s raining they’ll provide ponchos but if someone saw a guide holding an umbrella it’s because they - the guide - isn’t allowed to wear a poncho. They have to bring an umbrella. Maybe if she had the baby the guide was helping but it’s strict that they look good. They can ride any ride - and usually will with kids if there’s one you just aren’t about - but most refuse the wet ones. In fact i think the one in animal kingdom is a no regardless. 

Two of our guides would secure a table and even get our silverware. Heck once our mobile order was ready he got our food for us instead of us getting up. During Covid they weren’t allowed to eat with you but post Covid they did. I can’t imagine Caroline’s is hanging out. Lol 

Also this year our guide ‘got’ all our snacks in the mouse - including coffee. But that’s like saying the plane on a soda is free. We paid for them one way or another. lol

The guides can make or break. You can ask them anything. They have all the Disney knowledge. They’ll dish on celebs in a tasteful way. They can be very fun. They are basically on vacation with you for days. I had one i didn’t love and in hindsight i should’ve let them know to make a change. I was invited to my first guides wedding.

I am in a unique financial position. Some guides I’ve split with other people. One was gifted by my parents.  I love Disney though so for me I can’t go without it’s so crowded for the average person. I’ve been going to Disney since I was a kid. 

You also absolutely should tip your guide. I hope she does. I think a lot of the service you receive is about who you are.

#       The Orphan: An Autobiography of Ahn Yong-Suh



My tōng-seng and I plopped ourselves down on our butts in the middle of a dirt street with too many bodies and smoke from all the trucks, cars, and buses. The sky was too low. There were rows and rows of food carts everywhere. It was the biggest street with the most people we had ever seen with good smells everywhere. The expensive food smells were swirling in our noses, like the pleasant burning smoke of a cooking fire in our shi-gōl.[\[1\]](#_ftn1) It was the smell of meats and baked bbpäng we never had at home. I didn’t know where we were in Seoul, maybe hwa-gōk dōng, shi-chung, maybe Itaewon[\[2\]](#_ftn2), except that it was over a day away on a train from our Kwangju[^(\[3\])](#_ftn3),[^(\[4\])](#_ftn4) mountainside; and that it had to be somewhere near where our father lived.  

Stomping his feet, “*peh-go-pah,”* he was complaining he was hungry. Which meant my *tōng-seng* was having a hard time resisting all the food aromas and I couldn’t do anything about it. I just had to ignore him.   

Whenever we wandered around our *shi-gōl*, usually he would complain*, “pee-goh-neh,”* whining of being tired, which meant that I had to give him a piggyback ride. I usually told him, “*shi-lr̃uh*.”

Even though he was hungry, there was no panic. He was too young to understand that complaining about being hungry didn’t mean anything for us. It was useless, just an annoying reminder that we were always hungry.

I hated him like the pesky pigeons everywhere, pecking here and there on the ground, and finding food. When I said, “*shi-lr̃uh*,” it meant that I didn’t want to.

The pigeons would jump high in the air to avoid a car, and then come back down and start pecking here and there, again, finding food.

I was over two years older than him, but he would call me *mung-chung*, which means, “stupid.” I always thought to myself, haha;[\[5\]](#_ftn5) I wasn’t teaching him any manners. In Korea, you must respect anyone that is older than you, no matter what age you are. That’s how tired I was, then. I didn’t even scold him for being rude to me.

We were in this situation, all because he had to follow a *kahng-ha-ji*, a puppy, all over the place. I had to follow him, even though our *hyoung,* elder brother, told us to stay put while he stepped down inside a dark metal gate and disappeared behind the entrance door. In front of this door, I noticed some wooden shoes and slippers, some water had spilled on the floor. We didn’t own any shoes or slippers.   

We lost the *kahng-ha-ji*.

Sometimes the mean cars and trucks hurtled everything into a gray, and dusty cloud, where you couldn’t see anything. It was just like all the high walls and fences around some houses in this city, everything in sight seemed unkind and mean to us. And even though it was comforting by not being able to see anything in this chaos, the thought of being lost slowly began creeping into my mind.

I got scared for my *tōng-seng* with all the moving taxis that were hidden in the cloud of dust. Through some of the dusty fog I could make out goats and cows, a shape of a *hal-mō-ni—*grandmother, with a tall *kimchi* jar on her head walking carefully straight up. I could see shapes of *tek-shi*\-*dool* (taxis) and buses speeding past, and suddenly I panicked like seeing some crazy-eyed middle-aged man—*ajoshi*, lurking in the dust who would drag you into an *uh-du-wall gōl-mōk*—dark alley, and pin you against the wall, and hurt you in your butt.

Whenever that happened, to escape the terrible smell of the *ajoshi*, I would picture our *hal-mō-ni* in Kwangju with the fresh air without any smell. And the birds with outspread wings were resting up above, floating high in the blue sky. The dark birds against the blue sky were bluer, and higher than the sun. I wondered about those birds. How they got there. And the cool wind breezing around me. But the sky was spinning at the *gōl-mōk* with the clouds like it did the first time I drank *mahkkoli,* fermented rice milk, a *sool* (alcohol), from my *hyoung* and his friends*.* I threw up outside on the dirt. I didn’t know why, but the *mahkkoli* made me turn around and run outside to throw up a milky patch in the dirt.

That was the first time I threw up.

I couldn’t hear anything through the hard blowing wind, but I heard tin metal clanging through it, with the dust slowly clearing in the vast street. There were too many people shouting and tiny trucks stained in soot hauling piles of *yun-tahn,* which were black cylinders of coal the size of coffee cans stacked high on the flatbed, with ropes flapping around, with too many noisy cars, too many carts, with too many *tek-shi-dool*. I saw a *cha-jun-guh,* a bicycle falling over. You could hear, “*kay-seki*,”[^(\[6\])](#_ftn6) ricocheting around—not a nice word. Further, in the distance I noticed tall black men dressed in trees with long metal sticks stepping over a real beggar. That beggar didn’t have any legs, just arms, laying on a wooden board with tiny wheels.

However today disaster struck, and I fear I’m a better and more humble man because of it. 

I awoke around 4:30am, earlier than my normal. I’m going to an event tonight and therefore won’t have my usual time to hit the gym after work before heading home. Nevertheless I arose from my bed and staggered in to my kitchen. As I went through the motions of grinding my beans and getting my kettle to boil I contemplated my early morning plans and what I needed to do at work. At last my kettle had reached boil and I was ready to brew. I assembled my Aeropress in the inverted fashion as I have so many times before; added my beans and water and realized I had inserted the plunger too deep. “No worries” I thought aloud, I’ll just pull it back a little; this worked with ease and I was able to add the last bit of water. I fastened my cap and for some reason unbeknownst to me (maybe the morning grog) I grabbed the press from the filter area. No sooner did I comprehend that this wasn’t a great course of action did the body separate, showering hot water and soggy coffee all over the coffee bar and I. Deleted I took off my soiled clothing and went to the bedroom to inform my wife that I had made a huge mess and therefore might make some excess noise cleaning.

He refused to help with night feeds and constantly complains about how tired he is. My only sister lives at the other end of the country. I’m combi-feeding so couldn’t attend any mother-baby groups for the first few months as my baby was pretty much always feeding. 

All my friends had their babies much earlier than me (I’m 40) and only three of them have come over to see me (once I told my partner I felt like I was going crazy from being on my own); even then, they’ve been once and that’s it. Nobody calls or texts to see how baby and I are, which is so far removed from how I was with them when they had their kids. 

I went back to the gym and was sexually harassed. 

I’ve stopped going to the mother and baby drop-ins because no-one will talk to me. I try and make conversation and the other mums just ignore me. They all go out for cake and coffee afterwards and I’ve never been invited.

Yeah, like playing cards, or trading cards, I'd collect these cards I write just like Pokemon cards, arrange them into decks, tag them with types, maybe I'd even build some sort of rarity system.

I had visions of this *ultimate card game*, only, the cards were moments from my real life: ideas, memories, experiences, everything.

The idea captured my passion, my time and energy for many years (still does) and I just wanted to build it and talk about it. I'm sure there are a lot of you who can relate to that feeling of passion and excitement you get pouring your soul into a beloved creation of yours.

So my app, [noto.ooo](https://noto.ooo), is built, I'm always tinkering away on it. Naturally, I talk to my friends about it, and then to some not-so-friends, and then occasionally someone I don't know shows interest and I am elated by the chance to share my passion project with them - it's the hardest thing, to hold myself back from going into a full on monologue.

This is where I realised a new passion of mine... *sharing my passion*. I wanted to show my app to others and I wanted it to be **something they loved!** I reflect on all the apps I've loved using and I wanted to create something that inspired that feeling in others.

Sitting on a fully functional app, I'm now faced with two brand new challenges (the scariest of all?):

Marketing & Onboarding. (A duo perhaps more challenging than Ornstein & Smough... Dark Souls anyone?)

Oh man, there is a lot to learn in these spaces, but I thought, you can't start marketing if you don't have some kind of onboarding right?

So I spent a great deal of energy putting together [what I thought was a pretty hot splash screen](https://imgur.com/gallery/attempts-some-hot-onboarding-bKqxd4O).

* It's directly in the app, so you can get straight into writing with the call to action buttons

To be honest, I was really proud of myself. I had done something that had been haunting me for a while - *summing up the features that make up my app and making them clearly presentable.*

I started putting [noto.ooo](https://noto.ooo) out there, to see if anyone liked it and I got a comment saying that the splash screen was **awful**, continuing to say that it **looked like something out of the 2000's**!

\*gasp\*, I thought to myself, ""Maybe I've missed the mark""

Time to improve then, so I [spun up some new concepts](https://imgur.com/a/bKqxd4O) (scroll down) for a more interactive onboarding experience that guides the user through the features naturally, ""showing not telling"".

I feel like I didn't spend years of sweat and coffee just to fail at onboarding... I want to know what you think - **Hot** or *Cold*?

Is my [current onboarding](https://noto.ooo) **awful** and 2000's-esque? How do the [new concepts](https://imgur.com/gallery/attempts-some-hot-onboarding-bKqxd4O) stack up? Does anyone relate, what have your onboarding struggles and wins been?",1,1740482563.0,indiehackers,1,1.0,False

She started getting patches of eczema  at a few days old, so I went off most dairy (lots if family history or lactose and dairy intolerance so it was the first thing I tried) and it got a lot better, went 100% off dairy and it cleared up. 

The few times I forgot or didn't realise something had milk or butter in it her eczema would flare up again, so I resigned myself to being off dairy for the time being.

I took her to the GP to talk about it and the GP said it was not a good idea for me to cut out an entire food group, instead we should treat the eczema when it comes with topical steroid cream, which she wrote a script for. 

I took her word for it and a coffee with real milk to test,  but by that evening and all the next day my daughter had painful gas, and was just plain unsettled, then I noticed the day after eczema flaring up on her face. I felt so bad that I caused it sort of intentionally. 

I am trusting my gut and staying completely dairy despite what the doctor said, since it honestly makes more sense to prevent something rather than treat it. 

Has anyone else had the same advice? Or different advice that worked?

Whether you're into espresso, pour-over, or French press, choosing the best coffee grinder ensures you get consistent grind sizes for better extraction and flavor. After testing multiple models, I’ve narrowed down the best coffee grinders based on performance, consistency, ease of use, and overall value.

# [Baratza Sette 270 – Best for Espresso Enthusiasts](https://yourtechbuddies.com/coffee-grinder/#1)

**Pros:**

* 30 grind settings with micro-adjustments
* Fast and precise grinding
* Built-in digital timer
* Minimal retention

**Cons:**

* Louder than other burr grinders
* Slightly more expensive than entry-level models

**My Experience**

The Baratza Sette 270 is a game-changer for espresso lovers. The unique straight-through burr design delivers incredibly consistent grinds, making it ideal for pulling the perfect shot. During testing, I found that adjusting the micro-steps allowed for precise dialing in, ensuring optimal extraction. The grind speed is impressive, but it is louder than some alternatives. If you're serious about espresso, the Sette 270 is worth every penny.

# [Timemore 064S – Best for Versatility and Design](https://yourtechbuddies.com/coffee-grinder/#2)

**Pros:**

* Stepless grind adjustment for precise control
* High-quality 64mm burrs for even grind distribution
* Low noise and minimal heat buildup
* Sleek and compact design

**Cons:**

* Slight learning curve for new users
* More expensive than entry-level grinders

**My Experience**

The Timemore 064S is a beautifully designed grinder that delivers exceptional consistency across various brew methods. Whether I was making espresso, pour-over, or French press, the grind quality was consistently impressive. The stepless adjustment takes a bit of practice but allows for fine-tuning to match any brewing method. I also appreciated how quiet it was compared to the Baratza Sette. If you want a high-end grinder that balances precision and aesthetics, this is a top contender.

# [OXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee Grinder – Best for Budget-Friendly Brewing](https://yourtechbuddies.com/coffee-grinder/#3)

**Pros:**

* Affordable price with solid performance
* 15 grind settings with micro adjustments
* Large bean hopper and simple interface
* Consistent grind quality for drip coffee and French press

**Cons:**

* Not ideal for espresso due to limited fine adjustments
* Slight static buildup in the grind container

**My Experience**

For those looking for a budget-friendly grinder without sacrificing grind consistency, the OXO Brew Conical Burr Grinder is a fantastic option. It performed well for medium to coarse grinds, making it great for drip coffee and French press. However, when testing it for espresso, I found that it lacked the micro-adjustments needed for true espresso precision. The static buildup was slightly annoying, but overall, it's an excellent entry-level grinder with an intuitive design.

**Final Thoughts: Which Grinder Should You Choose?**

* For espresso lovers: Go with the Baratza Sette 270 for precise grind control and minimal retention.
* For versatility and premium design, the Timemore 064S offers a sleek build with stepless adjustments.
* For budget-conscious buyers: The OXO Brew Conical Burr Grinder delivers great performance at an affordable price.

Investing in a quality coffee grinder is essential for unlocking the full flavor of your coffee beans.

As well as navigating my way throughout myself and understanding my feelings and emotions more.

I typically journal before bed to set a good habit for myself, and tonight’s wonder left me wanting to come on here and share for myself. 

I am surrounded by good friends, coworkers, decent family life ( although is not the best ), and a stable, loving and good relationship. I noticed how most of the time when it came to hanging out or spending time with those people, it was always me initiating the plans. Or even checking in every once in a while throughout the week just to see how they were doing, etc. Though I stopped doing that. I stopped putting effort into that aspect of my life, just to see if the same energy was reciprocated. I stopped putting the effort in because I realized that a lot of the times I would try and put effort into hanging out or doing things it was always excused, ignored, or forgotten. It’s just tiring. 

It’s been nearly a week and a half since my boyfriend has asked to hangout with me, let alone even see me. I haven’t been asked to hangout with my friends/coworkers. There’s been times I would text my boyfriend, wanting to do small things like hop on the game for a little bit and play a couple of rounds, or even go out for a coffee just to say hi. But it’s always been cancelled as well as forgotten. Which hasn’t really been normal for us, as we typically hung out nearly every other day. 

I feel myself slowly pushing myself away from people when that happens, and I don’t know what to do. I spend every waking day by myself, and as I used to love doing things alone, I also like spending time with people that I love. As that is my main love language.

all three of us were coworkers and regularly hung out outside of work and i was under the impression we were becoming close friends, they recently became a couple and i guess i overstepped and i assume pressured one into talking to me about their feelings for the other. 

 they started ignoring me but both are busy people so i didn’t think to hard about it and i texted them the other day abt a movie night and one of them blew up at me that ive been making them uncomfortable for months, that they’ve been using body language for months to tell me that they don’t want to talk to me while treating me completely normal and saying how much they missed me every time i saw them at work, that something i said (or a he said she said im not sure) that i said girl 1 was a bad person for girl 2 (absolutely not true and my close friends know how happy i am for them) and that they didn’t tell me this to my face because they did not view me as a close friend at all and thought ignoring me was the best outcome but apparently needed to tell me bluntly cause i couldn’t get the hint. 

i was completely shocked i had no idea i was making them uncomfortable in any way or that some of the time i had been talking to them i had been 100% been overstepping their boundaries. and upset at the fact that neither of them decided to talk to me about these miscommunications because i would NEVER try and insert my self in that way when i know these two were friends. 

i did own up to my often oblivious-ness, apologize for everything and clarify some things that i believe were lost in communication and caused hurt. i just feel so utterly embarrassed, a couple of my other friends who read the messages told me the way she replied to me was really odd and i have little to apologize for because they never communicated their feelings to me. i told him it’s better i recognize that i messed up and made two people hurt when i didn’t mean to, apologize (don’t know if they got the message i might be blocked), and learn from this than to believe i am in the right. i just don’t know how to move on from the embarrassment and guilt of this all i feel like i can never show my face again in the coffee shop i worked at for two years and they definitely told all my other acquaintances from that store that i was making them uncomfortable ",1,1740481406.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False

1ixs79f,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1ixs79f/migraine_trigger_and_treatment/,Migraine trigger and treatment,"Hello all. Approximately 2-3 years ago my migraines started. I was prescribed sumatriptan and naproxen for the treatment. I never really felt like sumatriptan did much for me, but it was also hard for me to catch the migraine early enough which I’m aware is the best case for sumatriptan. I get them maybe 1-2 times a month or even sometimes I won’t get one for a couple months. They very in severity while most are usually in the middle of the road. Yesterday I got one and to my surprise was able to make an actual neurology appointment same day. She changed me over to rizatriptan, kept me with naproxen and prescribed compazine for nausea and a last resort. The migraine started at 11 and I saw the Dr at 2. I started the rizatriptan at 3:15 and by 5pm my headache was much worse, took a naproxen and within 2 hours it was still bad. Nausea was setting in, I was cold chilling and shivering pretty bad (new for me). I took the compazine and fell asleep for about 3 hours. Woke up and the nausea had subsided and the headache finally was reduced, but still there. Just more manageable. This was by far my worst migraine ever. I’m suspecting the rizatriptan made it worse? It wasn’t terrible before I took the medicine at 3, but was far worse a few hours faster. Usually for me I start out with blurred vision and dots, then within an hour the headache starts and a few hours later it’s peaked and just hanging out. To me my headache should’ve been at its peak around 3 when I took the medicine but it got far worse so I’m skeptical of the Rizatriptan. Does anyone else have a similar experience? What remedies work for you? 

I’ve never really found a direct trigger for them. At first I thought it was coffee but when I stopped drinking it I still had a couple, although they were potentially less frequent, but hard to tell. One morning when I went into the bathroom and turned the light on my eyes instantly got blurry and started spotting which is the precursor to my migraine, almost like sudden flashes of light can trigger it. But that doesn’t always cause it. Otherwise I can’t come up with a direct trigger that would cause them. ",1,1740480396.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

Then—ding! Your phone buzzes, a package arrives, your neighbor starts blasting music, and suddenly, your concentration is gone.

If you’re a freelance writer, this scenario probably sounds all too familiar. Working from home has its perks, but it also comes with distractions. A virtual office helps you stay focused and professional while maintaining the flexibility you love.

https://preview.redd.it/czhk28l9k9le1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7761970a014c09620462173e78e4ffea03f145b

**5 Reasons Why a Virtual Office is a Game-Changer for Freelance Writers**

**1. A Professional Address Builds Credibility**

Using your home address on contracts or LinkedIn doesn’t exactly scream professionalism. A virtual office provides a business address that enhances your credibility and reassures clients that you take your work seriously.

Having a legitimate address helps establish trust, making you stand out from the sea of freelancers operating from their kitchen tables.

**2. Minimize Household Distractions**

Working from home often means dealing with interruptions—pets seeking attention, noisy neighbors, or the temptation of an afternoon nap.

A virtual office allows you to escape these distractions without the commitment of a traditional office. Some services offer access to coworking spaces, providing a focused environment for deep work or a creative change of scenery.

**3. Access to Professional Meeting Spaces**

Freelance writing isn’t always about sending emails and editing drafts. Sometimes, you need in-person meetings to close deals or brainstorm ideas. While coffee shops can work, they aren’t always the best setting for serious discussions.

A virtual office gives you access to well-equipped meeting rooms, helping you present a polished, professional image when interacting with clients.

**4. Improve Work-Life Balance**

One of the biggest challenges of freelancing is separating work from personal life. When your home is your office, it’s easy to blur the lines, leading to burnout.

A virtual office helps establish boundaries, even if you don’t use a physical space daily. Services like mail and call handling keep business communications organized, allowing you to focus on your writing without unnecessary distractions.

A clear work-life balance leads to greater creativity, better productivity, and a healthier mindset.

**5. Cost-Effective Alternative to a Traditional Office**

The best part? A virtual office provides all these benefits without the high costs of renting a physical space. Office leases can be expensive, but as a freelancer, your budget is better spent on upgrading your tools or investing in your career growth.

With a virtual office, you only pay for the services you need—whether it’s a professional address, meeting room access, or occasional coworking spaces—making it a practical and affordable choice.

**Take Your Freelance Writing Career to the Next Level**

Freelancing offers unparalleled freedom, but it also comes with challenges like staying productive and maintaining a professional image. A virtual office bridges the gap, giving you the tools to work efficiently while preserving your independence.

If you’re looking to boost your credibility, reduce distractions, and create a structured work-life balance, a [**virtual office could be the perfect solution**](https://www.livingworkspace.com/virtual-business-address/). Your clients, productivity, and peace of mind will thank you for it.

Every morning i had my first cig with my cofee. I also brought coffee to work, and smoked a cig every lunchbreak while drinking it. 

I switched to nicotine pouches (swedish snus) right after, and i always put one in my lip after my coffee. Ever since 2020 i have felt a craving for nicotine everytime i consume coffee, energy drinks and alcohol. With the first sip of these drinks i get cravings, first it was cravings for feeling smoke in my throat and later on cravings for the kick nicotine pouches gave me.

I quit snus about three weeks ago. I consumed around 10 pouches a day, so around 100 mg och nicotine throughout the whole day. The withdrawal symptoms have been tough, but i’m trying to push them through with the help of walks. Walking has helped immensely with the sweating and shaking i get during the evenings.

I still drink coffee every morning, even though i get cravings everytime i drink. Some mornings are better than others, and right now as i’m writing this my cravings are quite high. 

I am fighting the urge to not go to the store to buy snus again, my mind is kind of forgetting all the reasons i don’t want to snus when my cravings are like this. I’m sure a lot of you can relate to the mind forgetting all the negative effects when you’re in withdrawal. Don’t worry though, i won’t give in to my cravings.

According to google the cravings for nicotine after caffeine and alcohol is because of habits, and i guess that checks out. 

How has everyone else’s experience with this been like? When could you guys enjoy a cup of coffee again without getting the sweats for nicotine? How did you push it through?",3,1740479785.0,quittingsmoking,2,1.0,False

Yeah, like playing cards, or trading cards, I'd collect these cards I write just like Pokemon cards, arrange them into decks, tag them with types, maybe I'd even build some sort of rarity system.

I had visions of this *ultimate card game*, only, the cards were moments from my real life: ideas, memories, experiences, everything.

The idea captured my passion, my time and energy for many years (still does) and I just wanted to build it and talk about it. I'm sure there are a lot of you who can relate to that feeling of passion and excitement you get pouring your soul into a beloved creation of yours.

So my app, [noto.ooo](https://noto.ooo), is built, I'm always tinkering away on it. Naturally, I talk to my friends about it, and then to some not-so-friends, and then occasionally someone I don't know shows interest and I am elated by the chance to share my passion project with them - it's the hardest thing, to hold myself back from going into a full on monologue.

This is where I realised a new passion of mine... *sharing my passion*. I wanted to show my app to others and I wanted it to be **something they loved!** I reflect on all the apps I've loved using and I wanted to create something that inspired that feeling in others.

Sitting on a fully functional app, I'm now faced with two brand new challenges (the scariest of all?):

Marketing & Onboarding. (A duo perhaps more challenging than Ornstein & Smough... Dark Souls anyone?)

Oh man, there is a lot to learn in these spaces, but I thought, you can't start marketing if you don't have some kind of onboarding right?

So I spent a great deal of energy putting together [what I thought was a pretty hot splash screen](https://imgur.com/gallery/attempts-some-hot-onboarding-bKqxd4O).

* It's light, it's quick, it runs you through the basics
* It has pictures and screenshots of different functions and ""learn more"" buttons for deeper understanding of features and how to use them
* It's directly in the app, so you can get straight into writing with the call to action buttons

To be honest, I was really proud of myself. I had done something that had been haunting me for a while - *summing up the features that make up my app and making them clearly presentable.*

I started putting [noto.ooo](https://noto.ooo) out there, to see if anyone liked it and I got a comment saying that the splash screen was **awful**, continuing to say that it **looked like something out of the 2000's**!

\*gasp\*, I thought to myself, ""Maybe I've missed the mark""

Time to improve then, so I [spun up some new concepts](https://imgur.com/a/bKqxd4O) (scroll down) for a more interactive onboarding experience that guides the user through the features naturally, ""showing not telling"".

I feel like I didn't spend years of sweat and coffee just to fail at onboarding... I want to know what you think - **Hot** or *Cold*?

Is my [current onboarding](https://noto.ooo) **awful** and 2000's-esque? How do the [new concepts](https://imgur.com/gallery/attempts-some-hot-onboarding-bKqxd4O) stack up? Does anyone relate, what have your onboarding struggles and wins been?",0,1740479773.0,SideProject,0,0.5,False

Creating a thriving indoor or outdoor garden can be made easier with the right nutrients. Making your own DIY plant fertilizers is an excellent way to ensure that your greenery receives beneficial elements without breaking the bank. Here are five effective DIY plant fertilizers that can enhance the health of your plants.

### 1. Banana Peel Fertilizer

Banana peels are rich in potassium and phosphorus, essential nutrients that promote flowering and root development. Simply chop up banana peels and bury them in the soil near your plants. Alternatively, you can soak the peels in water for a few days and use the liquid as a fertilizer.

### 2. Coffee Ground Fertilizer

Used coffee grounds are an excellent source of nitrogen, which helps promote leafy growth. You can sprinkle coffee grounds directly onto the soil or mix them into the compost pile. This not only benefits the plants but also enhances soil structure.

### 3. Eggshell Fertilizer

Eggshells are a fantastic source of calcium, vital for plant cell development and preventing blossom end rot in tomatoes. Rinse and dry eggshells, crush them into small pieces, and add them to the soil. This slow-release fertilizer will gradually provide essential nutrients.

### 4. Epsom Salt Fertilizer

Epsom salt is rich in magnesium, which helps in the synthesis of chlorophyll and strengthens plant cell walls. Mix a tablespoon of Epsom salt in a gallon of water and use it to water your plants once a month for improved growth and vigor.

### 5. Comfrey Tea

Comfrey leaves are packed with nutrients, including potassium and nitrogen. To create comfrey tea, steep fresh or dried comfrey leaves in water for a few weeks. Dilute the mixture before applying it to your plants to boost their growth.

Using these 5 DIY plant fertilizers not only supports healthier greenery but also fosters a sustainable gardening practice. By incorporating these natural methods, you can ensure your plants thrive and your garden flourishes.

So I play with a group of friends who go to the same college as me. And I have been playing with them for at least two years now (albeit with some players coming and going). We recently started up a new game though and our party’s rogue decided to take up DMing for a change.

He was a pretty good DM to be fair. He didn’t prepare but man was he a master at improv. We the party built all of our characters and we generally tended to gravitate towards the typical archetypes we usually play as. We had our hippie healer, our horny bards (or horny warlock occasionally), our borderline murderhobo, and me—a lawful good “voice of reason” paladin. 

While I appreciate edgy characters, I usually like playing the opposite and the party loved to bust my balls about it. They’d tell me to take the stick out of my ass and lighten up and all that good stuff. It was all in good fun—or so I thought.

One day, we were playing at borderline murderhobo’s house and we had just finished a major battle with a powerful Goblin Samurai and so we headed back to the City. It may not sound like it, but this was a massive accomplishment for us. That Goblin Samurai was our nemesis for the last 5 or so sessions now. were euphoric. Borderline Murderhobo mentioned how he was gonna find this Priest and kill him for converting his girlfriend and making her swear an oath to a life of religious celibacy. The rest of the party was on board. The sentiment was basically “Fuck it, we all deserve one random act of murder + loot”. Plus the temple was loaded. My character was obviously opposed to this idea and threatened to tell the authorities. 

Borderline Murderhobo groaned and said “No worries” with an evil grin. I smirk, thinking he is planning something in game that I was gonna have to thwart. He then abruptly said. Let's have a break. I want some meth—y’all want some? We all agreed. He gave us our meth as we talked a bit and then got back to our game. As we went to the city, I started feeling real jittery and wild and the feeling just escalated. It was unlike any other feeling I could imagine. And I felt impulsive. So when the party inevitably did kill the priest, I also joined in. And then I started cheering super loud and then I remembered saying “Fuck it, I’m killing every mother fucker in here!” DM just laughed and said “You know you’re gonna become an oathbreaker paladin after this right?” I said “Fuck my oaths! Its time to turn this temple red!” And we slaughtered everyone in the temple. Including the children. And afterwards, we were greeted by city watchmen and city templars (paladins) who tried to stop us as we escaped.

As we were on the road, discussing means to change our identities as wanted men (and women), I was in real life feeling worse and worse as my heart was pounding like never before and I was paranoid both about getting attacked in DnD and paranoid about dying irl from some heart attack. I started theorizing that maybe my meth was too strong and I even asked borderline (not so borderline) murderhobo’s player how much meth he put in. He said “Just the right amount” as he could barely hold off laughter which freaked me out. I kept pressing until he admitted he added “a little something extra”. I asked him if it was weed and he just laughed his ass off. DM then asked him “Ok dude what the hell did you do to our coffee. This isn’t funny.” And he just kept laughing and said “Its just (paladin’s) meth! He’s tweaking!” We ALL let out a collective “WHAT!?!?” as he just kept laughing. 

I then start freaking out more as the DM and party try to calm me down as I am now flailing in my seat and start crying. I think the crying got to borderline murderhobo’s player cause he did stop laughing after that and tried to tell me its ok and that he only put a little bit in there. Horny bard’s player asks “How much is a ‘little bit’ huh?” He said “Just like 50 mg tops” DM then said “50mg! You fucking asshole! Go! Get out! Go somewhere!!” He then said “This is my house” but DM just stared him down and he left. The next few hours were a nightmare of paranoia and shame but they stayed there with me until my friend got me to go to sleep (lol) after I drank a boatload of calming tea and got me some calming music. Still didn’t get to sleep for a WHILE but eventually I did. The next morning DM was still there and he offered to take me to get some food. I guess borderline murderhobo stayed at a hotel but he came back the next morning profusely apologetic before I left. I didn’t want to speak to him and I haven’t since and the DnD game is on pause.

At this point though I have put some distance between me and the incident and while I’m definitely not at “look back and laugh at this” yet, I do wonder if I am willing to forgive him given the fact that he does seem sincerely apologetic and I kinda just want my life back to normal. But I don’t know. I need at LEAST another month before even considering it and DM to his credit put the game on delay for more or less around that long.",1,1740479173.0,DnDcirclejerk,5,1.0,False

Essentially things are so bad with my MIL I don’t know what to do. Yesterday she dropped off all my husband’s children items and said he is cut from the will (not that we care about that part, but it’s the intention that is upsetting). 

The background: my MIL has always been  difficult as has my FIL. They were always a bit cold toward me (but they are quite odd people so it never bothered me much). 

However, a year after I got married, they both really turned on me. I think it was because there was an issue with my parents at the wedding (my parents don’t want to tell me what happened as they don’t want to poison the relationship- but from what I have gathered from my SO I know that it was something to do with FIL calling the son of my mums best friend - who is a party planner and organised the entire wedding for free - a moron. And my mum raised this with FIL after the wedding, which went down terribly.) My in laws don’t really have any friends and I think they were expecting to be close to my parents, and I think they were taking out their frustration at the situation on my parents on me. For context, my parents are really reasonable and tried their best. They threw the wedding (in laws did not offer to contribute even though they have money) and said there was no limit on the number of guests my in laws could invite, because they wanted them to feel welcomed. They invited 50 people and 2 came - which I hope gives some idea of how “well liked” they are. 

FIL was open about disliking me - he would either fully ignore me at family dinners or make digs at me in front of family and the family would just ignore and pretend it wasn’t happening. 

I feel like I really tried my best with them. I would always bring little gifts when I went round for dinner, invited MIL and FIL for dinner, kept in touch by message etc. I hated going to them for dinner, especially when FIL was so hostile to me, but I continued to go to make things better. But it got so stressful for me that I had to take anti anxiety medication. 

After about  year of this hostility my MIL randomly sent me a series of nasty messages late one night about how I don’t respect her and put in any effort - it was really strange I actually thought she was drunk (I have since learnt she is just a bit of a keyboard warrior). I found this so bizarre as only the previous week I had gone round for dinner and brought a really nice chocolate cake - which I thought was making an effort. 


After this, my SO and I went to my in laws to chat about moving forward. When I got there they were sat in front of an iPad which had a long list of grievances against me. They told me that they were angry with me for the way I behaved at their daughter’s wedding as I did not wish them congratulations and I ignored them on the wedding day. This is completely false and I was really taken aback - I reminded MIL we had a nice time, were dancing together, but this fell on deaf ears. The conversation turned to my parents and then they complained about how different disgusting and rude they are. FIL called my mum “sick”. I stormed out of the house with SO. 

We have had a year of LC following this. My SO has been really upset with this as he was really close to his parents. He spoke to his MIL who said she wanted to apologise. No word for FIL. So I met MIL for coffee. The only thing she half apologised for was sending those nasty messages a year ago and then she tried to blame me for not making effort. I reminded her that I had tried (I was like “remember that afternoon I had you round to show me how to do your meat dish?”)  and her response was “why can’t you cook?”. I was so angry at this point I said “why don’t you have a job” (she has never worked). She said that my wedding was the worst day of her life, complained about my parents, and that my husband never wanted to marry me. She said there was something wrong with my parents as they have never fallen out with people before. I went nuclear and said you needed friends first to fall out with; that she only had one couple come to the wedding; that she has never welcomed me into their family; and that the past year not having them in my life has been a weight off my shoulders. 

She is the ultimate gaslighter - the conversation was a disaster and I really lost it. Following this, she has been harassing my SO on message non stop. She has also demanded that I give back her grandmothers necklace which she gave me when I got engaged (it was supposed to be turned into an engagement ring but as she was so difficult during our engagement SO instead wanted to get me a new ring with none of the negativity attached to the necklace. The one nice thing my MIL did was gift the necklace to me regardless of not using it for a ring.). 

Yesterday, she dropped off all SO’s childhood stuff and said he’s out the will. No idea why she’s dragging SO into this, as he has been an amazing son and has always pushed me into having a relationship when his parents, and being the “bigger person” when it comes to them. 

I would be delighted to never see them again, but I am worried how this will affect SO. Also I am starting IVF this week, so timing could not be worse. 

Would love some advice: was this my fault? Did I go too far in saying MIL had no friends etc? (She told SO that no one has ever made her feel so bad about herself etc). 

Also - what do I do about the necklace? Legally it is mine, but I’m not sure I want to sink to their level of pettiness. It’s the only thing I have ever been given from my in laws other than grief. I am happy to give it back if it means she will leave me alone in future.

Do I apologise for saying hurtful things (knowing I will never get an apology back)? She is playing a huge victim here and has clearly forgotten all the rude things she has said to me. Currently I have blocked her so she can’t contact me (but I doubt she has tried to). She is mostly just harassing SO now. 

All advice / thoughts welcome!

Now, I need to back it up with a solid itinerary. I know Adelaide isn’t the kind of place that screams for attention, and honestly, I love that about it. But for people who think anything outside Sydney or Melbourne is “boring,” what are the must visit spots that will actually impress them?

I’d love to hear what you’d show off if you had visitors who need convincing that Adelaide is, in fact, the best place to live.

I know some of you want to keep Adelaide a secret, and that’s fair, I literally call it Wakanda in my family for the same reason. But don’t worry, I’ll make sure they don’t end up here 🤣.

Di ako busy sobra sa work, I work remotely. And most of the time im on my phone. 

Hope there's someone here na available rin always yung tipong magaan ang oras, we can also exchange social media accts pag parehas tayo mag vibe, I prefer the rest of the conversation ay sa messenger, alam ko kasi magiging lonely na ang messenger ko pag dumating yung time na talagang makipag break na ko. 

Also, g rin ako for a coffee. Around Laspinas, Alabang and hanggang Biñan Laguna lang sana.
