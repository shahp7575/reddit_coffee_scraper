1pnojma,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cinephiles/comments/1pnojma/is_the_modern_movie_experience_losing_its_soul_or/,🎬 “Is the modern movie experience losing its soul — or evolving?”,"I’ve been thinking about how streaming, marketing, and social media have changed the way we experience movies.

It used to feel like films were cultural events — slow-burn conversations that lived in theaters and coffee shops for weeks.

Now, even brilliant films disappear from public consciousness within days after release.

Recently, I stumbled upon BloodReel.com￼ — it curates new releases and indie films in a way that feels more cinematic appreciation than clickbait. It got me wondering if we’re missing spaces that celebrate the art of film rather than its “content” side.

Do you think platforms like this (focused more on discussion and discovery) could help restore that deeper connection to movies?

Or are we past the era where film communities shape how we experience cinema?

But we did not talk much and for the next 5 months we never saw each other again. At this meeting she doesn't recognize me, I introduced myself again, we chat a little then left again. And again until the previous week we never saw each other. 

 For context we meet time to time because we are in an organization together. 

 And last week she decided to become more active in this organization (I was already very active). For 1 week we saw each other but did not talk much until 3 days ago. That day we were working on something and she was at my team so we had time to chat more. She was having fun time and talking to me a lot, also laughing at my jokes. 

 Yesterday we met again for organization meeting, she was very chill and talkative. After the meeting me, she and a few friends went to a cafe to have some coffee and. We all had good time, then all of our friends left. Her house is close time mine so we decided to leave together. We took the bus. While we were getting in the bus she said ""I didn't realize you had green eyes"". I don't how she saw my eyes at that position. I answered as ""Yes I have beautiful eyes"". Then we started chatting, she was laughing all my jokes, listening me, asking questions about me. At some point she said something like ""I don't think I can have relationship with someone who is not in an organization like ours."" (That wasn't out of context). Then ask me if I have a girlfriend (I don't have one). We chat a little more, while I was explaining something she interrupted me and said ""When the light hit your face, I really realized that you have beautiful eyes.""

 (She made a plan to meet me again while talking)

 We kept talking until the bus arrived her house. After she left bus I sat on a seat. Then she texted me ""you sat already, you are weak"". (That was a joke between us). Then texted me a joke that I made a few days ago. (She remembers that little joke).

 This morning she texted me again. Texts context was about her current situation and a joke about her situation. Then she asked how I am doing. 

We will meet again, that's all for now. I don't know if she is being friendly or she is into me. ",0,1765846708.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False
1pnoi4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1pnoi4a/data_science_nyc_networking/,Data Science NYC Networking,"Hey all,

I graduated undergrad with ChemE & Finance and then worked in big pharma for 4 years. I started a part time remote masters in data science at my alma mater during that time, which I’m 2 courses away from completing. Given the non-immersive nature of an online degree, especially drawn out so long taking one class at a time while also juggling many other life things, I felt I really didn’t learn much.

So I’m currently working a ski job for the winter as a career break, then I plan to use all of Summer 2026 to do my own “self study”, essentially reteaching myself the MS in Data Science via textbooks and other resources, doing passion projects and building an online portfolio. I’ve actually gradually started this now, but it’ll really ramp up after the winter ends.

I know SF would technically be the better hub for this, but I’ll be living in NYC. I previously lived there and absolutely loved the energy and I’m dying to return. It’s also close to family in PA which is important to me. Anyway, I know networking and learning from others is crucial, so I’m curious if anyone knows of any good conferences or workshops that allow anyone to attend (I know some conferences vet their attendees to ensure top talent, so I’d be looking for open invite type conferences). Or even if not a formal conferences, any suggestions for other ways to network? I’m planning to live in a co-living situation and hopefully meet other young professionals that way.

1pnockc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huel/comments/1pnockc/huel_black_edition_powder_formula_change/,Huel Black Edition Powder Formula Change,"Hey everyone,

There has been quite a lot of discussion recently about the changes to the Black Edition Powder formula, so I just wanted to address a few common questions and themes, as well as create a spot for us to continue the discussion.

A while ago, we sent out an email regarding the changes that would be made to the formula in the United States, which someone kindly shared on reddit [here](http://reddit.com/r/Huel/comments/1nhx1vh/notification_of_huel_black_edition_powder_updates/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). The reasoning for these changes were to improve the taste and texture, and the changes were the following:

We upgraded to a new pea protein for a smoother texture and improved taste, removed kombucha, which was more about streamlining the supply chain, and replaced MCT powder with coconut milk powder, again for smoothness/texture. As mentioned above, these changes only affected U.S. customers, and not any other regions. These changes did alter the nutritional breakdown a bit, and were rolled out in phases depending on flavor. This information was included in the initial email but I included them again here for clarity.

**Nutrition Refinements (will vary slightly by flavor)**

Fiber, increased to up to 3g per serving across the range, with a similar increase in carbs.  
Sugar is decreasing by up to 4g per serving.  
Protein is still 40g.   
Each serving still provides a highly nutritious, complete meal.

**Approximate Dates of Changes**

Salted Caramel - *late September / late October*  
Vanilla - *late October*  
Chocolate - *mid October*  
Cookies & Cream - *mid October / mid October*  
Coffee Caramel - *mid October*  
Strawberry Shortcake - *mid October / late October*  
Cinnamon Roll - *late October*  
Banana - *early November*  
Unflavored & Unsweetened - *late December*  
Variety Box (10-serving bags) *- from early December*  
Vanilla 10-serving *- early December*  
Chocolate 10-serving *- late January*  
Banana 10-serving *- mid December*

Just to be clear on a few things that I’ve seen being brought up in the comments on other posts, here are a couple replies to those FAQs!

**Why did you make this change?**

In addition to the people that have loved and enjoyed Black Edition for many years, there are many customers who try Black Edition one time and never come back. Their main complaint is texture.

**Did you make this change to save on cost?**

No, this was a change to improve texture and reduce product complexity.

**Will you change it back? Can I get the old recipe?**

Not at this time. However, we're always taking feedback on board. The best place to send this is [support@huel.com](mailto:support@huel.com), as this is how we aggregate data for our technical team, so that they can keep track of broader recipe trends.

If you have any further questions please pop them in the comments below and I will do my best to answer them. Also, from now on, all posts or questions regarding the formula adjustment of Black Edition Powder will be redirected to this post to keep everything organized and in one place.

Thank you!!

(or is it 8 months?),"I apologize for how long this is gonna be , We live in a country where the official religion is Islam so relationships are a bit tougher to maintain and frowned upon so i cant ask family and friends don’t speak from wisdom and experience.

I work retail next to where she lives , we met 8 months ago , we laughed , we became friends .

I always thought of myself being with someone the same age as me or 1-2 yrs difference max , i saw her as young for me at first , she dropped some hints that I missed because i kinda saw her as too young (she didn’t say or do anything to support that , just in my head my partner was very close to me in age ) and I had closed my heart to focus on work and Uni , also because i was hurt by someone who played with my feelings so it messed up my perception of when I am wanted. I don’t like empty ‘relationships’ to fill loneliness or time ( never done that and never will) .

Then it happened , she texted first, we chatted for hours , turned out to be much more mature than I thought  , I already loved her personality now I loved it even more , she even trusted me with some pics ( no nudes and I don’t want any but it should be mentioned as its something that takes a lot of time and trust in out culture ) so Immediately set up a date( something that also takes a bit of time and we did it literally the next day ) to see what is happening and what is this, i didn’t overthink the date i set some pointers in my head and decided to play it by ear with her , I picked her up and long story short we ended up in a simple coffee house (we both wanted that) on the roof with an amazing view where it was slightly cold and just the two of us .

It was amazing , maybe a bit unorthodox to me because we already knew so much about each other ( we knew names , ages , careers , homes , families, and other things) but the conversation was really heartwarming and deep. We flirted like crazy , compliments from both sides , i’d stare at her when she talked and she’d smile and shy away . I parked a bit far away from the coffee house so we would walk together , on the way back we held hands (first time in my life , felt amazing) I open the door for her and we hold hands in the car , she then grabs my arm , hugs it and rests her head on my shoulder (best feeling i ever had , at a red light i rested my head onto hers and melted )

I drop her off and After the date it was careful from both sides , she said this was the first time she was happy and not acting happy for a long time , i have no problem with vulnerability and I love honesty so I was really honest with how I felt about each part of the date ( really positive feedback from both sides) she even sent me a reel where a girl sleeps on a guys chest just like she did .

I then head to a night shift at my job ( had to be night, so the date could work) , finished at 1 a.m and had to go tell my friend cuz i was going crazy , i tell her that I’m gonna hang with a friend , she gets upset and says she doesn’t like me hanging out this late , I’m flabbergasted , its the 2nd day we’ve been talking its too early to be doing this , but then again we did just skip a lot of steps so maybe she felt like that was the normal thing to do , we disagree , i make it up to her , we have a nice deep chat .

The 3rd day it got even crazier , she said she loves me and she had feelings for months and they transformed into love after we started talking ( 3 dayssss!!) , I am extremely and utterly shocked . She is extremely beautiful, Definitely a 10 and she knows it . which made me fear this was physical from my side , which isn’t a disaster you should definitely be attracted to your partner but I fear physical attraction because what happens to it when that attractiveness-based feeling is gone? Its the end of the 3rd day now , we talk after both heading home from work , I aim for a deep chat to ease my overthinking.

I ask her if she considers she knows me for 8 months or 3 days She says definitely months , she says we were never customer/worker in her head and she doesnt consider herself to be getting to know a new me . I tell her I am an over-thinker , she says she is too .  She tells me she has this problem , when she talks to people she spaces out in her own head , but she tells me it didn’t happen when I was talking and she was so relieved by that , she tells me when she hugged my arm the only sound she could hear was her own heartbeat and how happy she was . We talk more and more and my worries get smaller .

The question/s I have :

Do I feel like this is too fast because I saw her as too young for me ( I didn’t realize how mature she was ) and I closed my heart on relationships and saw what we had as normal and playful and she saw it as the potential of something serious?

This is the dream of majority of people , why am I overthinking this and not enjoying it? Maybe because it’s too easy and I have never had good things happen to me easily?

Is this gonna vanish in less than 3 months and I’m gonna be hurt again? Or is my history making me insecure to actually enjoy something awesome happening to me ?

What would you do? Bear in mind i am looking for something serious.

Also when you love someone from far away , isnt that just physical attraction? Or do I just not get it cuz love so intertwined with character for me ?

TL;DR : I am wondering if my relationship counts as 3 days or 8 months , and is it moving too fast or not .",1,1765846102.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I'm Going to Get Him Back (Part 1),"When dad got locked up again, it didn’t hit right away. He’d been in and out since I was nine, but this time felt different. Longer sentence. Something about assault with a weapon and parole violations. My mom, Marisol, cried once, then shut down completely. No yelling, no last minute plea to judge for leniency—just silence.

“He’s going away for at least fifteen years.”

It wasn’t news. We all knew. I’d heard her crying about it on the phone to my grandma in the Philippines through the paper-thin wall. My little sister, Kiana heard it too but didn’t say anything. Just curled up on the mattress with his headphones on, pretending she couldn’t.

Then mom couldn’t make rent. The landlord came by with that fake sympathy, like he felt bad but not bad enough to wait one more week for rent before evicting us.

Our house in Fresno was one of those old stucco duplexes with mold in the vents and a broken front fence. Still, it was home.

“We’ll get a fresh start,” Mom said.

And by “fresh start,” she meant a cabin in the Sierra Nevada that looked cheap even in blurry online photos. The only reason it was so affordable was because another family—who was somehow even worse off than we were—was willing to split the cost. We’d “make it work.” Whatever that meant.

I packed my clothes in trash bags. My baby brother, Nico, clutched his PS4 the whole time like someone was gonna steal it. Mom sold the washer and our living room couch for gas money.

When we finally pulled up, the place wasn’t a cabin so much as a box with windows. The woods pressed tight around it like the trees wanted to swallow it whole.

“Looks haunted,” I muttered, stepping out of the car and staring at the place. It had a sagging roof, moss creeping up one side, and a screen door that hung off one hinge like it gave up trying years ago.

Nico’s face scrunched up. “Haunted? For real?”

I shrugged. “Guess we’ll find out tonight.”

“We will?” He whispers.

Mom shot me that look. “Seriously, Roen?” she snapped. “You think this is funny? No, baby, it’s not haunted.” She reassured Nico.

I swung one of the trash bags over my shoulder and headed for the front door. The steps creaked loud under my feet, like even they weren’t sure they could hold me. Just as I reached for the knob— I heard voices. Two people inside, arguing loud enough that I didn’t need to strain to catch it.

“I’m not sharing a room with some random people, Mom!” Said a girl’s voice.

A second voice fired back, older, calmer but tight with frustration. “Maya, we’ve been over this. We don’t have a choice.”

Then I heard footsteps—fast ones, heavy and pissed off, thudding through the cabin toward the door.

Before I could move out of the way or even say anything, the front door flung open hard—right into me. The edge caught me square in the shoulder and chest, knocking the air out of me as I stumbled backward and landed flat on the porch with a loud thump.

“Shit,” I muttered, wincing.

A shadow filled the doorway. I looked up and there she was—the girl, standing over me with wide eyes and a face full of panic.

“Oh my god—I didn’t see you,” she said, breathless. “Are you okay? I didn’t—God, I’m sorry.”

She knelt down a little, hand halfway out like she wasn’t sure if she should help me up or if she’d already done enough damage.

I sat up, rubbing my ribs and trying not to look like it actually hurt as bad as it did. “Yeah,” I grunted. “I mean, it’s just a screen door. Not like it was made of steel or anything.”

I grabbed her outstretched hand. Her grip was stronger than I expected, but her fingers trembled a little.

She looked about my age—sixteen, maybe seventeen—with this messy blonde braid half falling apart and a hoodie that looked like it had been through a few too many wash cycles. Her nails were painted black, chipped down to the corners. She didn’t let go of my hand right away.

Her face changed fast. Like something hot in her just shut off the second our eyes locked. The sharp edge drained out of her expression, like she forgot what she was mad about.

“I didn’t know anyone was standing out here,” she said again, softer this time. “I just... needed air.”

“It’s all good,” I said, brushing dirt off my jeans and trying to gather my spilled stuff. “Not my first time getting knocked down today.”

She glanced awkwardly back inside. “So... guess that means you’re the people we’re sharing this dump with?”

“Yup. The other half of the broke brigade.”

She held out her hand. “I’m Maya.”

I took it. “Roen.”

“Let me guess…say you’re here because of someone else’s screw-up.”

“How’s you know?” I asked surprised.

She shrugged. “Let’s just say you’re not the only one.”

Behind me, Nico whispered, “Is she a ghost?”

Maya raised an eyebrow. “Who's that?”

“My brother. He’s eight. He’s gonna ask a million questions, so get ready.”

She smirked. “Bring it on. I’ve survived worse.” I believed her.

Kiana was already climbing out of the car, dragging her own trash bag behind her, when she caught sight of me and Maya still talking.

“Ohhh,” she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, drawing out the sound with a stupid grin. “Roen’s already got a girlfriend in the woods.”

I rolled my eyes. “Shut up, Kiana.”

Maya snorted but didn’t say anything, just crossed her arms and waited like she was curious how this was gonna play out.

“I’m just saying,” she whispered, “you’ve known her for like two minutes and you’re already helping each other off the porch like it’s a rom-com.”

“You’re not even supposed to know what that is.” “I’m twelve, not dumb.”

“She’s cute,” Kiana added, smirking now as she walked past. “Y’all gonna braid each other’s hair later?”

“I swear to god—”

“Language,” Mom chided from behind me.

Before I could fire back, the front door creaked open again, and a woman stepped out. Thin, wiry frame. She wore a faded flannel and sweatpants like she’d stopped trying to impress anyone years ago. Her eyes darted across us—counting, maybe—and her smile didn’t quite reach all the way up.

“You must be the Mayumis,” she said. Her voice was raspy, probably from too many cigarettes or too many bad nights. Maybe both. “I’m Tasha. Tasha Foster.”

She stepped closer, and the smell hit me—sharp and bitter. Whiskey.

Mom appeared behind us just in time. “Hi, I’m Marisol,” she said quietly, arms crossed like she already regretted every decision that led us here.

They hugged briefly. More of a press of shoulders than a real embrace. Tasha nodded toward the cabin. “We’re tight on space, but we cleared out the back room. Me, you, and the girls can take that. The boys can have the den.”

“Boys?” I asked, stepping into the doorway and immediately getting swarmed by noise.

Inside, it looked like someone tried to clean but gave up halfway through. There were dishes drying on one side of the sink, and unfolded laundry piled on the couch. A crusty pizza box sat on the counter next to an open bottle of something that definitely wasn’t juice.

Then came the thundering feet—three of them. First was a chubby kid with wild curls and a superhero shirt that was two sizes too small. He stopped, blinked at us, then just yelled, “New people!”

A girl around Kiana’s age followed, hair in tight braids and a glare that said she didn’t trust any of us. Behind her was a tall, lanky boy with headphones around his neck and that look teens get when they’re stuck somewhere they hate.

Maya rolled her eyes. “These are my siblings. That loud one’s Jay, the girl with the death stare is Bri, and the quiet one’s Malik.”

Jay darted toward Nico immediately, pointing at the PS4. “You got games?!”

Nico lit up. “A bunch.”

Mom and Tasha slipped into the kitchen to talk in low voices while the rest of us stood there in this weird moment of strangers under one roof.

Maya looked around at the chaos. “So… welcome to the party.”

“Some party,” I muttered, but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth.

Kiana elbowed me. “I like it here,” she said.

—

Starting a new school in the middle of the year is trash. No one tells you where anything is, teachers already have favorites, and everybody’s locked into their little cliques like they’re afraid being friendly’s contagious.

Maya and I ended up in the same homeroom, which helped. It was the only part of the day that didn’t feel like I was walking into someone else’s house uninvited. She sat two rows over at first, headphones in, scribbling in the margins of a beat-up copy of The Bell Jar. I didn’t even know she read stuff like that.

We got paired up in Physics too—lab partners. I’m more of the “just tell me what to do and I’ll do it” type when it comes to school. I play ball. Football mostly, but I’m decent at track. Maya actually liked the subject. Asked questions. Took notes like they meant something. The first week, I thought we’d hate working together—like she’d think I was an idiot or something—but it wasn’t like that. She explained things without making it weird.

She’d let me copy her answers—but only after I tried to understand them first.

At lunch, she sat outside under the trees near the side parking lot. Alone at first. I started joining her, ditching my usual spot with the guys.

I soon found out why she kept to herself. It started small. A few whispers behind cupped hands, little laughs when Maya walked past in the hallway. She didn’t react at first, just rolled her eyes and kept walking. But I saw the tightness in her jaw. The way her grip on her backpack straps got a little firmer.

Then one day, someone didn’t bother whispering.

The comments started behind her back—“Isn’t she the one with the crackhead mom?”, “Heard she’s got, like, four half-siblings. All different dads.”

I felt Maya tense beside me. Not flinch—just go still, like something inside her snapped into place. She didn’t say anything. Didn’t even look at them. She just turned and walked fast, then faster, then she was running down the hall.

“Yo,” I called after her, but she was already gone. I spun back to the group gossiping.

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I snapped. Heads turned. Good.

One of the guys laughed. “Relax, man. It’s just facts.”

“Facts?” I stepped closer. “You don’t know shit about her.”

The girl rolled her eyes. “She’s gonna end up just like her mom anyway. Everyone knows that.”

“Oh fuck off!” I shouted. I didn’t wait. I took off after Maya.

I checked the bathroom first. Empty. Then the quad. Nothing. My last period bell rang, but I didn’t care. I headed to the library because it was the only quiet place left in this school.

She was tucked into the far back corner, half-hidden behind the tall shelves nobody ever went to. Sitting on the floor. Knees pulled in. Hoodie sleeve pushed up.

My stomach dropped.

“Maya,” I said, low. Careful.

She didn’t look up.

I took a few slow steps closer and saw it—the razor in her hand.

Her arm was a roadmap of old lines. Some faded. Some not.

“Hey,” I said, softer now. “Don’t.”

Her hand paused.

“You’re not allowed to say that,” she muttered. Her voice was wrecked. “You don’t get to stop me.”

“I know,” I said. “But I’m asking anyway.”

She laughed once, sharp and ugly. “They’re right, you know. About me. About all of it.”

I crouched down in front of her, keeping my hands where she could see them. “They don’t know you.”

“They know enough,” she said. “My mom’s an addict. She disappears for days. Sometimes weeks. We all got different dads. None of them stuck. People hear that and they already got my ending figured out.”

“You’re not,” I said.

She lifted the razor slightly. “You don’t know that.”

She finally looked at me. Her blue eyes were red, furious, tired. “You think I don’t see it? I’m already halfway there.”

I swallowed. “I know what it’s like when everyone assumes you’re trash because of who raised you.” That got her attention.

“My dad’s been locked up most of my life,” I said. “I’ve got scars too.” I tapped my knuckles. Old marks. “From standing up to him when I shouldn’t have. From thinking I could fix things if I just tried harder.” She stared at my hands like she was seeing them for the first time.

“I used to think if I didn’t fight back, I’d turn into him,” I went on. “Turns out, fighting him didn’t make me better either. Just made everything louder.”

Her grip on the razor loosened a little.

I reached out slowly. “Can you give me that?”

She hesitated. Long enough that my heart was pounding in my ears. Then she dropped the razor into my palm like it weighed a thousand pounds.

She covered her face and finally broke.

I stayed there. Didn’t try to fix it. Didn’t say the wrong hopeful crap. Just sat on the library floor with her while she cried it out.

— ​​That night, I knocked on Maya’s door after everyone had crashed.

“I have an idea,” I whispered. “It’s mean though…” Maya smirked. “The meaner the better.”

That morning, we showed up to school early. We had backpacks full of supplies—a screwdriver, glitter, expired sardines, and four tiny tubes of industrial-strength superglue.

We snuck into the locker hallway when the janitor went for his smoke break. Maya kept lookout while I unscrewed the hinges on three locker doors—each one belonging to the worst of the trash-talkers. We laced the inside edges with glue, so when they slammed shut like usual, they’d stay that way.

Inside one of them, we left a glitter bomb rigged to pop the second the door opened. In another, Maya stuffed the expired sardines into a pencil pouch and superglued that shut too. The smell would hit like a punch in the face.

We barely made it to homeroom before the chaos started.

First period: screaming from the hallway. Second period: a janitor with bolt cutters. By third period, the whole school was buzzing.

And then we got called to the office.

We got caught on cameras. Of course. We didn’t even try to lie. Just sat there while the vice principal read us the suspension notice like he was personally offended.

“Three days. Home. No extracurriculars. You’re lucky we’re not calling the police.”

Outside the office, Maya bumped my shoulder. “Worth it?”

I grinned. “Every second.”

—

I got my permit that November. Mom let me borrow the car sometimes, mostly because she was too tired to argue. We made it count—gas station dinners, thrift store photo shoots, late-night drives to nowhere.

We’d sneak out some nights just to lie in the truck bed and stare at the stars through the trees, counting satellites and pretending they were escape pods.

The first time she kissed me, it wasn’t planned. We were sitting in the school parking lot, waiting for the rain to let up. She just looked over and said, “I’m gonna do something stupid,” then leaned in before I could ask what. After that, it all moved fast.

The first time we had sex was in the back of the car, parked on an old forestry road, all fumbling hands and held breath. We thought we were careful.

The scare happened two weeks later. A late period, a pregnancy test from the pharmacy. The longest three minutes of our lives, standing in that cabin’s moldy bathroom, waiting. When it was negative, we didn’t celebrate. She laughed. I almost cried.

After that, we thought more about the future. Maya started talking about college more. Somewhere far. I didn’t have plans like that, but I was working weekends at the pizza shop, and started saving. Not for clothes or games—just for getting out.

—

By December, things settled down a bit. We tried to make the best of the holidays. All month, the cabin smelled like pine and mildew and cheap cinnamon candles. We’d managed to scrape together some decorations—paper snowflakes, a string of busted lights that only half worked, and a sad fake tree we found at the thrift store for five bucks. Nico hung plastic ornaments like it was the real deal. Kiana made hot cocoa from a dollar store mix and forced everyone to drink it. Mom even smiled a few times, though it never lasted.

Maya and I did our part. Helped the little kids wrap presents in newspaper. Made jokes about how Santa probably skipped our cabin because the GPS gave up halfway up the mountain.

Even Tasha seemed mellow for once.

But then Christmas Eve hit.

Maya’s mom announced that afternoon she was inviting her new boyfriend over for dinner. Some dude named Rick or Rich or something. Maya went quiet first, then full-on exploded.

“You’re kidding, right?” she snapped. “You’re really bringing some random guy here? On Christmas Eve?”

Tasha shrugged like it was no big deal. “He’s not random. I’ve known him for months.”

“And that makes it fucking okay? And now we’re supposed to play happy family?”

“Watch your mouth.”

“Or what? You’ll vanish for a week and pretend this never happened?”

Tasha lit a cigarette inside the house, which she only did when she was mad. “It’s my house, Maya. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”

Maya laughed. “Gladly.”

She grabbed her bag and was out the door before I could say anything. I followed.

We sat on the steps while the cold settled into our bones. She didn’t talk. Just stared out at the trees, fists clenched in her lap like she was holding herself together by force. I leaned over, bumped her shoulder.

“Let’s bounce.”

She looked at me. “Where?""

“Anywhere but here.”

So we sneaked out. I borrowed Mom’s car.

We drove up to a dirt road, way up past the ranger station, where the trees cleared and gave you this wide, unreal view of the valley below. You could see for miles.

I popped the trunk, and we sat with our legs hanging out the back, wrapped in a blanket. I pulled out the six-pack I’d stashed—some knockoff lager from that corner store near school that never asked questions. Maya lit a joint she’d swiped from her mom’s stash and passed it to me without saying anything.

We just sat there, knees touching, sipping beer and smoking the joint, watching our breath cloud up in the freezing air. Maya played music off her phone, low. Some old indie Christmas playlist she’d downloaded for the irony.

At one point, she leaned her head on my shoulder.

“Thanks,” she whispered.

“For what?”

“For giving me something that doesn’t suck.”

—

Maya was humming some half-forgotten carol when I noticed it—this streak of light cutting across the night sky, low and fast. At first I thought it was just a shooting star, but it didn’t fizzle out like it was supposed to. It curved. Like it was changing direction. Like it knew where it was going.

“Did you see that?” I asked.

She lifted her head. “What?”

I pointed. “That...”

Maya squinted. “What am I supposed to be looking at?” I fumbled the binoculars from the glovebox—old ones my uncle gave me for spotting deer. I raised them to my eyes.

I held them up so that Maya could see too, adjusted the focus, and froze.

Maya noticed right away. “What? What is it?”

Through the binoculars, there were figures—too many to count, all of them fast. Not like planes. More like shadows ripping across the sky, riding... something. Horses, maybe. Or things shaped like horses but wrong. Twisted. And riders—tall, thin figures wrapped in cloaks that whipped in the wind, some with skull faces, some with no faces at all. Weapons glinted in their hands. Swords. Spears. Chains.

“Oh. No,” Maya whispered.

“What is it?” I asked.

She looked at me. “It’s heading towards the cabin.”

I snatched the binoculars back, my hands shaking so hard the image blurred. It took me three tries to steady them against my face.

She was right.

The things weren’t just in the sky anymore. They were descending, a dark wave pouring down the tree line toward the base of the mountain. Toward our road. Toward the cabin.

“We have to go. Now.”

We scrambled into the car. I spun the tires in the dirt, wrenching the wheel toward home. The headlights carved a shaky path through the dark as we flew down the mountain road, branches slapping the windshield. “Call my mom,” I told Maya, handing my phone to her. “Put it on speaker.” The ringing seemed to last forever. Mom picked up.

“Roen? Where are you? Where’s the car?” The anger was a live wire.

“Mom, listen! You have to get everyone inside. Lock the doors. Right now.”

“What are you talking about? Are you in trouble?”

“Mom, no! Listen! There’s something coming. From the sky. We saw it. It’s coming down the mountain toward the cabin.”

A beat of dead silence. Then her tone, cold and disbelieving. “Have you been doing drugs? Is Maya with you?”

“Mom, I swear to God, I’m… Please, just look outside. Go to a window and look up toward the ridge.”

“I’m looking, Roen. I don’t see anything but trees and…” She trailed off. I heard a faint, distant sound through the phone, like bells, but twisted and metallic. “What is that noise?”

Then, Nico’s voice, excited in the background. “Mom! Mom! Look! It’s Santa’s sleigh! I see the lights!”

Kiana joined in. “Whoa! Are those reindeer?”

“Kids, get back from the window,” Mom said, but her voice had changed. The anger was gone, replaced by a slow-dawning confusion. The bells were louder now, mixed with a sound like wind tearing through a canyon.

“Mom, it’s NOT Santa!” I was yelling, my foot pressing the accelerator to the floor. The car fishtailed on a gravel curve. “Get everyone and run into the woods! Now!”

The line went quiet for one second too long. Not dead quiet—I could hear the muffled rustle of the phone in my mom’s hand, a sharp intake of breath.

Then the sounds started.

Not bells anymore. Something lower, a grinding hum that vibrated through the phone speaker. It was followed by a skittering, scraping noise, like claws on slate, getting closer. Fast.

“Marisol?” Tasha’s voice, distant and confused. “Is something on the roof?”

A thud shook the line, so heavy it made my mom gasp. Then a shriek—not human, something high and chittering.

A window shattered. A massive, bursting crunch, like something had come straight through the wall.

Then the screams started.

Not just screams of fear. These were sounds of pure, physical terror. Kiana’s high-pitched shriek cut off into a gurgle. Nico wailed, “Mommy!” before his voice was swallowed by a thick, wet thud and a crash of furniture.

“NO! GET AWAY FROM THEM!” My mom’s voice was raw, a warrior’s cry. I heard a grunt of effort, the smash of something heavy—maybe a lamp, a chair—connecting, followed by a hiss that was absolutely not human.

Tasha was cursing, a stream of furious, slurred shouts. There was a scuffle, then a body hitting the floor.

“ROEN!” My mom screamed my name into the phone. It was the last clear word.

A final, piercing shriek was cut short. Then a heavy, dragging sound.

The line hissed with empty static for three heartbeats.

Then it went dead.

The car tore around the last bend. The cabin came into view, every window blazing with light. The front door was gone. Just a dark, open hole.

I slammed on the brakes, the car skidding to a stop fifty yards away.

The car was still ticking when I killed the engine. Maya grabbed my arm. “Roen. Don’t.”

I pulled free. My legs felt numb, like they didn’t belong to me anymore, but they still moved. Every step toward the house felt wrong, like I was walking into a memory that hadn’t happened yet.

The ground between us and the cabin was torn up—deep gouges in the dirt, snapped branches, something dragged straight through the yard. The porch was half gone. The roof sagged in the middle like it had been stepped on.

We desperately called our family’s names. But some part of me already knew no one would answer. The inside smelled wrong. Something metallic and burnt.

The living room barely looked like a room anymore. Furniture smashed flat. Walls cracked. Blood everywhere—smeared, sprayed, soaked into the carpet so dark it almost looked black. Bodies were scattered where people had been standing or running.

Jay was closest to the door. Or what was left of him. His body lay twisted at an angle that didn’t make sense, like he’d been thrown.

Bri was near the hallway. She was facedown, drowned in her own blood. One arm stretched out like she’d been reaching for someone. Malik was farther back, slumped against the wall, eyes open but empty, throat cut clean.

Tasha was near the kitchen. Or what was left of her. Her torso was slashed open, ribs visible through torn fabric. Her head was missing. One hand was clenched around a broken bottle, like she’d tried to fight back even when it was already over.

Maya dropped to her knees.

“No, mommy, no…” she said. Over and over.

I kept moving because if I stopped, I wasn’t sure I’d start again.

My hands were shaking so bad I had to press them into my jeans to steady myself.

“Mom,” I called out, even though I already knew.

The back room was crushed inward like something heavy had landed there.

Mom was on the floor. I knew it was her because she was curled around a smaller body.

Kiana was inside her arms, turned into my mom’s chest. Her head was gone. Just a ragged stump at her neck, soaked dark. My mom’s face was frozen mid-scream, eyes wide, mouth open, teeth bared.

I couldn’t breathe. My chest locked up, and for a second I thought I might pass out standing there. I dropped to my knees anyway.

“I’m sorry,” I said. To both of them. To all of them. Like it might still matter.

Then, something moved.

Not the house settling. Not the wind. This was close. Wet. Fast.

I snapped my head toward the hallway and backed up on instinct, almost slipping in blood. My heart was hammering so hard it felt like it was shaking my teeth loose.

“Maya,” I said, low and sharp. “Get up. Something’s still here.”

She sucked in a breath like she’d been punched and scrambled to her feet, eyes wild. I looked around for anything that wasn’t broken or nailed down.

That’s when I saw my mom’s hand.

Tucked against her wrist, half-hidden by her sleeve, was a revolver. The snub‑nose she kept buried in the back of the closet “just in case.” I’d seen it once, years ago, when she thought my dad was coming back drunk and angry.

I knelt and pried it free, gently, like she might still feel it.

The gun was warm.

I flipped the cylinder open with shaking fingers. Five loaded chambers. One spent casing.

“She got a shot off,” I whispered.

Maya was already moving. She grabbed a bat leaning against the wall near the tree—aluminum, cheap, still wrapped with a torn bow. Jay’s Christmas present. She peeled the plastic off and took a stance like she’d done this before.

The thing scuttled out of the hallway on all fours, moving with a broken, jerky grace. It was all wrong—a patchwork of fur and leathery skin, twisted horns, and eyes that burned like wet matches. It was big, shoulders hunched low to clear the ceiling. And on its flank, a raw, blackened crater wept thick, tar-like blood. My mom’s shot.

Our eyes met. Its jaws unhinged with a sound like cracking ice.

It charged.

I didn’t think. I raised the revolver and pulled the trigger. The first blast was deafening in the shattered room. It hit the thing in the chest, barely slowing it. I fired again. And again. The shots were too fast, my aim wild. I saw chunks of it jerk away. One shot took a piece of its ear. Another sparked off a horn. It was on me.

The smell hit—old blood and wet earth. A claw swiped, ripping my jacket.

That’s when the bat connected.

Maya swung from the side with everything she had. The aluminum thwanged against its knee. Something cracked. The creature buckled. She swung again, a two-handed blow to its ribs. Another sickening crunch.

The creature turned on her, giving me its side. I jammed the barrel of the pistol into its ribcase and fired the last round point-blank. The thing let out a shriek of pure agony.

The creature reeled back, a spray of dark fluid gushing from the new hole in its side. It hissed, legs buckling beneath it. It took a step forward and collapsed hard, one hand clawing at the floor like it still wanted to fight.

I stood there with the revolver hanging useless in my hand, ears ringing, lungs barely working. My jacket, my hands, my face—everything was slick with its blood. Thick, black, warm. It dripped off my fingers and splattered onto the wrecked floor like oil.

I couldn’t move. My brain felt unplugged. Like if I stayed perfectly still, none of this would be real.

“Roen.” Maya’s voice sounded far away. Then closer. “Roen—look at me.”

I didn’t.

She grabbed my wrists hard. Her hands were shaking worse than mine. “Hey. Hey. We have to go. Right now.”

I blinked. My eyes burned. “My mom… Kiana…”

“I know, babe,” she said, voice cracking but steady anyway. “But we can’t stay here.”

Something deep in me fought that. Screamed at me to stay. To do something. To not leave them like this.

Maya tugged me toward the door. I let her.

We stumbled out into the cold night, slipping in the torn-up dirt. The air hit my face and I sucked it in like I’d been underwater too long. The sky above the cabin was alive.

Shapes moved across it—dark figures lifting off from the ground, rising in spirals and lines, mounting beasts that shouldn’t exist. Antlers. Wings. Too many legs. Too many eyes. The sound came back, clearer now: bells, laughter, howling wind.

They rose over the treeline in a long, crooked procession, silhouettes cutting across the moon. And at the front of it— I stopped dead.

The sleigh floated higher than the rest, massive and ornate, pulled by creatures that looked like reindeer only in the loosest sense. Their bodies were stretched wrong, ribs showing through skin, eyes glowing like coals.

At the reins stood him.

Tall. Broad. Wrapped in red that looked stained in blood. His beard hung in clumps, matted and dark. His smile was too wide, teeth too many. A crown of antlers rose from his head, tangled with bells that rang wrong—deep, warped.

He reached down into the sleigh, grabbed something that kicked and screamed, and hauled it up by the arm.

Nico.

My brother thrashed, crying, his small hands clawing at the edge of the sleigh. I saw his face clearly in the firelight—terror, confusion, mouth open as he screamed my name.

“NO!” I tried to run. Maya wrapped her arms around my chest and hauled me back with everything she had.

The figure laughed. A deep, booming sound that echoed through the trees and into my bones. He shoved Nico headfirst into a bulging sack already writhing with movement—other kids, other screams—then tied it shut like it was nothing.

The sleigh lurched forward.The procession surged after it, riders whooping and shrieking as they climbed into the sky.

Something dragged itself out of the cabin behind us.

The wounded creature. The one we thought was dead.

It staggered on three limbs, leaving a thick trail of blood across the porch and into the dirt. It let out a broken, furious cry and launched itself forward as the sleigh passed overhead.

Its claws caught the back rail of the sleigh. It slammed into the side hard, dangling there, legs kicking uselessly as the procession carried it upward. Blood sprayed out behind it in a long, dark arc, raining down through the trees.

For a few seconds, it hung on. Dragged. Refused to let go. Then its grip failed.

The creature fell.

It vanished into the forest below with a distant, wet crash that echoed once and then went silent.

The sleigh didn’t slow.

The Santa thing threw his head back and laughed again, louder this time, like the sound itself was a victory. Then the hunt disappeared into the clouds, the bells fading until there was nothing left but wind and ruined trees and the broken shell of the cabin behind us.

—

We just sat down in the dirt a few yards from the cabin and held onto each other like if we let go, one of us would disappear too.

I don’t know how long it was. Long enough for the cold to stop mattering. Long enough for my hands to go numb around Maya’s jacket. Long enough for my brain to start doing this stupid thing where it kept trying to rewind, like maybe I’d missed a moment where I could’ve done something different.

It was Maya who finally remembered the phone.

“Roen,” she said, voice hoarse. “We have to call the police….”

My hands shook so bad I dropped my phone twice before I managed to unlock the screen. There was dried blood in the cracks of the case. I dialed 911 and put it on speaker because I didn’t trust myself to hold it.

The dispatcher’s voice was calm. Too calm.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

—

The cops showed up fast. Faster than I expected. Two cruisers at first, then more. Red and blue lights flooded the trees like some messed-up holiday display.

They separated us immediately.

Hands up. On your knees. Don’t move.

I remember one of them staring at my jacket, at the black blood smeared down my arms, and his hand never left his gun.

They asked us what happened. Over and over. Separately. Same questions, different words.

I told them there were things in the house. I told them they killed everyone. I told them they weren't human.

That was the exact moment their faces changed.

Not fear. Not concern.

Suspicion.

They cuffed my hands. Maya’s too.

At first, they tried to pin it on me. Or maybe both of us. Kept pressing like we were hiding something, like maybe there was a fight that got out of hand, or we snapped, or it was drugs. Asked where I dumped Nico’s body.

One of the detectives took the revolver out of an evidence bag and set it on the table of the interrogation room like it was a point he’d been waiting to make.

“So you fired this?”

“Yes,” I said. “At the thing.”

“What thing?”

I looked at him. “The thing that killed my family.”

He wrote something down and nodded like that explained everything.

When the forensics team finally showed up and started putting the scene together, it got harder to make it stick. The blood patterns, the way the bodies were torn apart—none of it made sense for a standard attack. Way too violent. Way too messy. Too many injuries that didn’t line up with the weapons they found. No human did that. No animal either, far as they could tell. But they sure as hell weren’t going to write “mythical sky monsters” in the report.

Next theory? My dad.

But he was still locked up. Solid alibi. The detectives even visited him in prison to personally make sure he was still there. After that, they looked at Rick. Tasha’s boyfriend. Only problem? They found him too. What was left of him, anyway. His body was found near the front yard, slumped against a tree. Neck snapped like a twig.

That’s when they got quiet. No more hard questions. Just forms. Statements. A counselor.

We were minors. No surviving family. That part was simple. Child Protect Services got involved.

They wanted to split us up. Said it was temporary, just until they could sort everything out. I got assigned a group home in Clovis. Maya got somewhere in Madera.

—

The day they told me I was getting moved, I didn’t even argue. There wasn’t any fight left. Just this empty numbness that settled behind my ribs and stayed there. The caseworker—Janine or Jenna or something—told me the social worker wanted to talk before the transfer. I figured it was some last-minute paperwork thing.

Instead, they walked me into this windowless office and shut the door behind me.

Maya was already there.

She looked as rough as I felt—pale, shadows under her baby-blue eyes. When she saw me, she blinked like she wasn’t sure I was real. We just stood there for a second.

Then she crossed the room and hugged me so hard it hurt. I held on. Didn’t say anything. Couldn’t.

“Hey,” she said into my shoulder. Her voice shook once. “Hey,” I replied.

“I thought they sent you away already,” I said.

“Almost,” she said. “Guess we got a delay.”

We pulled apart when someone cleared their throat.

I looked up to see a woman already in the room, standing near the wall.

She was in her late thirties, maybe. She didn’t look like a social worker I’d ever seen. Didn’t smell like stale coffee or exhaustion. Black blazer and jeans. Her dark brown hair was cropped short and neat. Her hazel eyes were sharp, measuring, like she was sizing up threats.

She closed the door behind her.

“I’m glad you two got a moment to catch up,” she said calmly. “Please, sit.”

“My name is Agent Sara Benoit,” she said.

The woman waited until we were seated before she spoke again. She didn’t rush it. Let the silence stretch just long enough to feel intentional.

“I know you’ve already talked to the police,” she said. “Multiple times.”

I let out a short, tired laugh. “Then why are we here again?” She looked at me directly. Not through me. Not like I was a problem to solve. “Because I’m not with the police.”

Maya stiffened beside me. I felt it through her sleeve.

I said, “So what? You’re a shrink? This is where you tell us we’re crazy, right?”

Benoit shook her head. “No. This is where I tell you I believe you.”

That landed heavier than any I’d heard so far.

I stared at her. “You… what?”

“I believe there was something non-human involved in the killings at that cabin,” she said. Flat. Like she was reading off a weather report. “I believe what you saw in the sky was real. And I believe the entity you described—what the media will eventually call an animal or a cult or a psychotic break—is none of those things.”

The room was quiet except for the hum of the lights.

Maya spoke up. “They said we were traumatized. That our minds filled in the gaps.”

Benoit nodded. “That’s what they have to say. It keeps things neat.”

That pissed me off more than anything else she could’ve said.

“Neat? I saw my family slaughtered,” I said. My voice stayed level, but it took work. “I watched something dressed like evil Santa kidnap my brother . If you’re about to tell me to move on, don’t.”

Benoit didn’t flinch.

“I’m not here to tell you that,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that what took your brother isn’t untouchable. And what killed your family doesn’t get to walk away clean.”

My chest tightened. Maya’s fingers found mine under the table and locked on.

I shook my head. “The fuck can you do about it? What are you? FBI? CIA? Some Men in Black knockoff with worse suits?”

She smirked at my jab, then reached into her blazer slowly, deliberately, like she didn’t want us to think she was pulling a weapon. She flipped open a leather badge wallet and slid it across the table.

‘NORAD Special Investigations Division’

The seal was real. The badge was heavy. Government ugly. No flair.

“…NORAD?” I said. “What’s that?”

“North American Aerospace Defense Command,” she explained. “Officially, we track airspace. Missiles. Unidentified aircraft. Anything that crosses borders where it shouldn’t.”

“What the hell does fucking NORAD want with us?” I demanded.

Benoit didn’t flinch. She just stated, “I’m here to offer you a choice.”

“A choice?” Maya asked.

She nodded. “Option one: you go to group homes, therapy, court dates. You try to live with what you saw. The official story will be ‘unknown assailants’ and ‘tragic circumstances.’ Your brother will be listed as deceased once the paperwork catches up.”

My chest burned. “And the other option?”

“Option two,” she said, her voice low and steady, “you come with me. You disappear on paper. New names, new files. You train with us. You learn what these things are, and how to kill them. Then you find the ones who did this. You get your brother back, and you make them pay.”",1,1765845645.0,DrCreepensVault,0,1.0,False

I'm Going to Get Him Back (Part 1),"When dad got locked up again, it didn’t hit right away. He’d been in and out since I was nine, but this time felt different. Longer sentence. Something about assault with a weapon and parole violations. My mom, Marisol, cried once, then shut down completely. No yelling, no last minute plea to judge for leniency—just silence.

“He’s going away for at least fifteen years.”

It wasn’t news. We all knew. I’d heard her crying about it on the phone to my grandma in the Philippines through the paper-thin wall. My little sister, Kiana heard it too but didn’t say anything. Just curled up on the mattress with his headphones on, pretending she couldn’t.

Then mom couldn’t make rent. The landlord came by with that fake sympathy, like he felt bad but not bad enough to wait one more week for rent before evicting us.

Our house in Fresno was one of those old stucco duplexes with mold in the vents and a broken front fence. Still, it was home.

“We’ll get a fresh start,” Mom said.

And by “fresh start,” she meant a cabin in the Sierra Nevada that looked cheap even in blurry online photos. The only reason it was so affordable was because another family—who was somehow even worse off than we were—was willing to split the cost. We’d “make it work.” Whatever that meant.

I packed my clothes in trash bags. My baby brother, Nico, clutched his PS4 the whole time like someone was gonna steal it. Mom sold the washer and our living room couch for gas money.

When we finally pulled up, the place wasn’t a cabin so much as a box with windows. The woods pressed tight around it like the trees wanted to swallow it whole.

“Looks haunted,” I muttered, stepping out of the car and staring at the place. It had a sagging roof, moss creeping up one side, and a screen door that hung off one hinge like it gave up trying years ago.

Nico’s face scrunched up. “Haunted? For real?”

I shrugged. “Guess we’ll find out tonight.”

“We will?” He whispers.

Mom shot me that look. “Seriously, Roen?” she snapped. “You think this is funny? No, baby, it’s not haunted.” She reassured Nico.

I swung one of the trash bags over my shoulder and headed for the front door. The steps creaked loud under my feet, like even they weren’t sure they could hold me. Just as I reached for the knob— I heard voices. Two people inside, arguing loud enough that I didn’t need to strain to catch it.

“I’m not sharing a room with some random people, Mom!” Said a girl’s voice.

A second voice fired back, older, calmer but tight with frustration. “Maya, we’ve been over this. We don’t have a choice.”

Then I heard footsteps—fast ones, heavy and pissed off, thudding through the cabin toward the door.

Before I could move out of the way or even say anything, the front door flung open hard—right into me. The edge caught me square in the shoulder and chest, knocking the air out of me as I stumbled backward and landed flat on the porch with a loud thump.

“Shit,” I muttered, wincing.

A shadow filled the doorway. I looked up and there she was—the girl, standing over me with wide eyes and a face full of panic.

“Oh my god—I didn’t see you,” she said, breathless. “Are you okay? I didn’t—God, I’m sorry.”

She knelt down a little, hand halfway out like she wasn’t sure if she should help me up or if she’d already done enough damage.

I sat up, rubbing my ribs and trying not to look like it actually hurt as bad as it did. “Yeah,” I grunted. “I mean, it’s just a screen door. Not like it was made of steel or anything.”

I grabbed her outstretched hand. Her grip was stronger than I expected, but her fingers trembled a little.

She looked about my age—sixteen, maybe seventeen—with this messy blonde braid half falling apart and a hoodie that looked like it had been through a few too many wash cycles. Her nails were painted black, chipped down to the corners. She didn’t let go of my hand right away.

Her face changed fast. Like something hot in her just shut off the second our eyes locked. The sharp edge drained out of her expression, like she forgot what she was mad about.

“I didn’t know anyone was standing out here,” she said again, softer this time. “I just... needed air.”

“It’s all good,” I said, brushing dirt off my jeans and trying to gather my spilled stuff. “Not my first time getting knocked down today.”

She glanced awkwardly back inside. “So... guess that means you’re the people we’re sharing this dump with?”

“Yup. The other half of the broke brigade.”

She held out her hand. “I’m Maya.”

I took it. “Roen.”

“Let me guess…say you’re here because of someone else’s screw-up.”

“How’s you know?” I asked surprised.

She shrugged. “Let’s just say you’re not the only one.”

Behind me, Nico whispered, “Is she a ghost?”

Maya raised an eyebrow. “Who's that?”

“My brother. He’s eight. He’s gonna ask a million questions, so get ready.”

She smirked. “Bring it on. I’ve survived worse.” I believed her.

Kiana was already climbing out of the car, dragging her own trash bag behind her, when she caught sight of me and Maya still talking.

“Ohhh,” she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, drawing out the sound with a stupid grin. “Roen’s already got a girlfriend in the woods.”

I rolled my eyes. “Shut up, Kiana.”

Maya snorted but didn’t say anything, just crossed her arms and waited like she was curious how this was gonna play out.

“I’m just saying,” she whispered, “you’ve known her for like two minutes and you’re already helping each other off the porch like it’s a rom-com.”

“You’re not even supposed to know what that is.” “I’m twelve, not dumb.”

“She’s cute,” Kiana added, smirking now as she walked past. “Y’all gonna braid each other’s hair later?”

“I swear to god—”

“Language,” Mom chided from behind me.

Before I could fire back, the front door creaked open again, and a woman stepped out. Thin, wiry frame. She wore a faded flannel and sweatpants like she’d stopped trying to impress anyone years ago. Her eyes darted across us—counting, maybe—and her smile didn’t quite reach all the way up.

“You must be the Mayumis,” she said. Her voice was raspy, probably from too many cigarettes or too many bad nights. Maybe both. “I’m Tasha. Tasha Foster.”

She stepped closer, and the smell hit me—sharp and bitter. Whiskey.

Mom appeared behind us just in time. “Hi, I’m Marisol,” she said quietly, arms crossed like she already regretted every decision that led us here.

They hugged briefly. More of a press of shoulders than a real embrace. Tasha nodded toward the cabin. “We’re tight on space, but we cleared out the back room. Me, you, and the girls can take that. The boys can have the den.”

“Boys?” I asked, stepping into the doorway and immediately getting swarmed by noise.

Inside, it looked like someone tried to clean but gave up halfway through. There were dishes drying on one side of the sink, and unfolded laundry piled on the couch. A crusty pizza box sat on the counter next to an open bottle of something that definitely wasn’t juice.

Then came the thundering feet—three of them. First was a chubby kid with wild curls and a superhero shirt that was two sizes too small. He stopped, blinked at us, then just yelled, “New people!”

A girl around Kiana’s age followed, hair in tight braids and a glare that said she didn’t trust any of us. Behind her was a tall, lanky boy with headphones around his neck and that look teens get when they’re stuck somewhere they hate.

Maya rolled her eyes. “These are my siblings. That loud one’s Jay, the girl with the death stare is Bri, and the quiet one’s Malik.”

Jay darted toward Nico immediately, pointing at the PS4. “You got games?!”

Nico lit up. “A bunch.”

Mom and Tasha slipped into the kitchen to talk in low voices while the rest of us stood there in this weird moment of strangers under one roof.

Maya looked around at the chaos. “So… welcome to the party.”

“Some party,” I muttered, but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth.

Kiana elbowed me. “I like it here,” she said.

—

Starting a new school in the middle of the year is trash. No one tells you where anything is, teachers already have favorites, and everybody’s locked into their little cliques like they’re afraid being friendly’s contagious.

Maya and I ended up in the same homeroom, which helped. It was the only part of the day that didn’t feel like I was walking into someone else’s house uninvited. She sat two rows over at first, headphones in, scribbling in the margins of a beat-up copy of The Bell Jar. I didn’t even know she read stuff like that.

We got paired up in Physics too—lab partners. I’m more of the “just tell me what to do and I’ll do it” type when it comes to school. I play ball. Football mostly, but I’m decent at track. Maya actually liked the subject. Asked questions. Took notes like they meant something. The first week, I thought we’d hate working together—like she’d think I was an idiot or something—but it wasn’t like that. She explained things without making it weird.

She’d let me copy her answers—but only after I tried to understand them first.

At lunch, she sat outside under the trees near the side parking lot. Alone at first. I started joining her, ditching my usual spot with the guys.

I soon found out why she kept to herself. It started small. A few whispers behind cupped hands, little laughs when Maya walked past in the hallway. She didn’t react at first, just rolled her eyes and kept walking. But I saw the tightness in her jaw. The way her grip on her backpack straps got a little firmer.

Then one day, someone didn’t bother whispering.

The comments started behind her back—“Isn’t she the one with the crackhead mom?”, “Heard she’s got, like, four half-siblings. All different dads.”

I felt Maya tense beside me. Not flinch—just go still, like something inside her snapped into place. She didn’t say anything. Didn’t even look at them. She just turned and walked fast, then faster, then she was running down the hall.

“Yo,” I called after her, but she was already gone. I spun back to the group gossiping.

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I snapped. Heads turned. Good.

One of the guys laughed. “Relax, man. It’s just facts.”

“Facts?” I stepped closer. “You don’t know shit about her.”

The girl rolled her eyes. “She’s gonna end up just like her mom anyway. Everyone knows that.”

“Oh fuck off!” I shouted. I didn’t wait. I took off after Maya.

I checked the bathroom first. Empty. Then the quad. Nothing. My last period bell rang, but I didn’t care. I headed to the library because it was the only quiet place left in this school.

She was tucked into the far back corner, half-hidden behind the tall shelves nobody ever went to. Sitting on the floor. Knees pulled in. Hoodie sleeve pushed up.

My stomach dropped.

“Maya,” I said, low. Careful.

She didn’t look up.

I took a few slow steps closer and saw it—the razor in her hand.

Her arm was a roadmap of old lines. Some faded. Some not.

“Hey,” I said, softer now. “Don’t.”

Her hand paused.

“You’re not allowed to say that,” she muttered. Her voice was wrecked. “You don’t get to stop me.”

“I know,” I said. “But I’m asking anyway.”

She laughed once, sharp and ugly. “They’re right, you know. About me. About all of it.”

I crouched down in front of her, keeping my hands where she could see them. “They don’t know you.”

“They know enough,” she said. “My mom’s an addict. She disappears for days. Sometimes weeks. We all got different dads. None of them stuck. People hear that and they already got my ending figured out.”

“You’re not,” I said.

She lifted the razor slightly. “You don’t know that.”

She finally looked at me. Her blue eyes were red, furious, tired. “You think I don’t see it? I’m already halfway there.”

I swallowed. “I know what it’s like when everyone assumes you’re trash because of who raised you.” That got her attention.

“My dad’s been locked up most of my life,” I said. “I’ve got scars too.” I tapped my knuckles. Old marks. “From standing up to him when I shouldn’t have. From thinking I could fix things if I just tried harder.” She stared at my hands like she was seeing them for the first time.

“I used to think if I didn’t fight back, I’d turn into him,” I went on. “Turns out, fighting him didn’t make me better either. Just made everything louder.”

Her grip on the razor loosened a little.

I reached out slowly. “Can you give me that?”

She hesitated. Long enough that my heart was pounding in my ears. Then she dropped the razor into my palm like it weighed a thousand pounds.

She covered her face and finally broke.

I stayed there. Didn’t try to fix it. Didn’t say the wrong hopeful crap. Just sat on the library floor with her while she cried it out.

— ​​That night, I knocked on Maya’s door after everyone had crashed.

“I have an idea,” I whispered. “It’s mean though…” Maya smirked. “The meaner the better.”

That morning, we showed up to school early. We had backpacks full of supplies—a screwdriver, glitter, expired sardines, and four tiny tubes of industrial-strength superglue.

We snuck into the locker hallway when the janitor went for his smoke break. Maya kept lookout while I unscrewed the hinges on three locker doors—each one belonging to the worst of the trash-talkers. We laced the inside edges with glue, so when they slammed shut like usual, they’d stay that way.

Inside one of them, we left a glitter bomb rigged to pop the second the door opened. In another, Maya stuffed the expired sardines into a pencil pouch and superglued that shut too. The smell would hit like a punch in the face.

We barely made it to homeroom before the chaos started.

First period: screaming from the hallway. Second period: a janitor with bolt cutters. By third period, the whole school was buzzing.

And then we got called to the office.

We got caught on cameras. Of course. We didn’t even try to lie. Just sat there while the vice principal read us the suspension notice like he was personally offended.

“Three days. Home. No extracurriculars. You’re lucky we’re not calling the police.”

Outside the office, Maya bumped my shoulder. “Worth it?”

I grinned. “Every second.”

—

I got my permit that November. Mom let me borrow the car sometimes, mostly because she was too tired to argue. We made it count—gas station dinners, thrift store photo shoots, late-night drives to nowhere.

We’d sneak out some nights just to lie in the truck bed and stare at the stars through the trees, counting satellites and pretending they were escape pods.

The first time she kissed me, it wasn’t planned. We were sitting in the school parking lot, waiting for the rain to let up. She just looked over and said, “I’m gonna do something stupid,” then leaned in before I could ask what. After that, it all moved fast.

The first time we had sex was in the back of the car, parked on an old forestry road, all fumbling hands and held breath. We thought we were careful.

The scare happened two weeks later. A late period, a pregnancy test from the pharmacy. The longest three minutes of our lives, standing in that cabin’s moldy bathroom, waiting. When it was negative, we didn’t celebrate. She laughed. I almost cried.

After that, we thought more about the future. Maya started talking about college more. Somewhere far. I didn’t have plans like that, but I was working weekends at the pizza shop, and started saving. Not for clothes or games—just for getting out.

—

By December, things settled down a bit. We tried to make the best of the holidays. All month, the cabin smelled like pine and mildew and cheap cinnamon candles. We’d managed to scrape together some decorations—paper snowflakes, a string of busted lights that only half worked, and a sad fake tree we found at the thrift store for five bucks. Nico hung plastic ornaments like it was the real deal. Kiana made hot cocoa from a dollar store mix and forced everyone to drink it. Mom even smiled a few times, though it never lasted.

Maya and I did our part. Helped the little kids wrap presents in newspaper. Made jokes about how Santa probably skipped our cabin because the GPS gave up halfway up the mountain.

Even Tasha seemed mellow for once.

But then Christmas Eve hit.

Maya’s mom announced that afternoon she was inviting her new boyfriend over for dinner. Some dude named Rick or Rich or something. Maya went quiet first, then full-on exploded.

“You’re kidding, right?” she snapped. “You’re really bringing some random guy here? On Christmas Eve?”

Tasha shrugged like it was no big deal. “He’s not random. I’ve known him for months.”

“And that makes it fucking okay? And now we’re supposed to play happy family?”

“Watch your mouth.”

“Or what? You’ll vanish for a week and pretend this never happened?”

Tasha lit a cigarette inside the house, which she only did when she was mad. “It’s my house, Maya. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”

Maya laughed. “Gladly.”

She grabbed her bag and was out the door before I could say anything. I followed.

We sat on the steps while the cold settled into our bones. She didn’t talk. Just stared out at the trees, fists clenched in her lap like she was holding herself together by force. I leaned over, bumped her shoulder.

“Let’s bounce.”

She looked at me. “Where?""

“Anywhere but here.”

So we sneaked out. I borrowed Mom’s car.

We drove up to a dirt road, way up past the ranger station, where the trees cleared and gave you this wide, unreal view of the valley below. You could see for miles.

I popped the trunk, and we sat with our legs hanging out the back, wrapped in a blanket. I pulled out the six-pack I’d stashed—some knockoff lager from that corner store near school that never asked questions. Maya lit a joint she’d swiped from her mom’s stash and passed it to me without saying anything.

We just sat there, knees touching, sipping beer and smoking the joint, watching our breath cloud up in the freezing air. Maya played music off her phone, low. Some old indie Christmas playlist she’d downloaded for the irony.

At one point, she leaned her head on my shoulder.

“Thanks,” she whispered.

“For what?”

“For giving me something that doesn’t suck.”

—

Maya was humming some half-forgotten carol when I noticed it—this streak of light cutting across the night sky, low and fast. At first I thought it was just a shooting star, but it didn’t fizzle out like it was supposed to. It curved. Like it was changing direction. Like it knew where it was going.

“Did you see that?” I asked.

She lifted her head. “What?”

I pointed. “That...”

Maya squinted. “What am I supposed to be looking at?” I fumbled the binoculars from the glovebox—old ones my uncle gave me for spotting deer. I raised them to my eyes.

I held them up so that Maya could see too, adjusted the focus, and froze.

Maya noticed right away. “What? What is it?”

Through the binoculars, there were figures—too many to count, all of them fast. Not like planes. More like shadows ripping across the sky, riding... something. Horses, maybe. Or things shaped like horses but wrong. Twisted. And riders—tall, thin figures wrapped in cloaks that whipped in the wind, some with skull faces, some with no faces at all. Weapons glinted in their hands. Swords. Spears. Chains.

“Oh. No,” Maya whispered.

“What is it?” I asked.

She looked at me. “It’s heading towards the cabin.”

I snatched the binoculars back, my hands shaking so hard the image blurred. It took me three tries to steady them against my face.

She was right.

The things weren’t just in the sky anymore. They were descending, a dark wave pouring down the tree line toward the base of the mountain. Toward our road. Toward the cabin.

“We have to go. Now.”

We scrambled into the car. I spun the tires in the dirt, wrenching the wheel toward home. The headlights carved a shaky path through the dark as we flew down the mountain road, branches slapping the windshield. “Call my mom,” I told Maya, handing my phone to her. “Put it on speaker.” The ringing seemed to last forever. Mom picked up.

“Roen? Where are you? Where’s the car?” The anger was a live wire.

“Mom, listen! You have to get everyone inside. Lock the doors. Right now.”

“What are you talking about? Are you in trouble?”

“Mom, no! Listen! There’s something coming. From the sky. We saw it. It’s coming down the mountain toward the cabin.”

A beat of dead silence. Then her tone, cold and disbelieving. “Have you been doing drugs? Is Maya with you?”

“Mom, I swear to God, I’m… Please, just look outside. Go to a window and look up toward the ridge.”

“I’m looking, Roen. I don’t see anything but trees and…” She trailed off. I heard a faint, distant sound through the phone, like bells, but twisted and metallic. “What is that noise?”

Then, Nico’s voice, excited in the background. “Mom! Mom! Look! It’s Santa’s sleigh! I see the lights!”

Kiana joined in. “Whoa! Are those reindeer?”

“Kids, get back from the window,” Mom said, but her voice had changed. The anger was gone, replaced by a slow-dawning confusion. The bells were louder now, mixed with a sound like wind tearing through a canyon.

“Mom, it’s NOT Santa!” I was yelling, my foot pressing the accelerator to the floor. The car fishtailed on a gravel curve. “Get everyone and run into the woods! Now!”

The line went quiet for one second too long. Not dead quiet—I could hear the muffled rustle of the phone in my mom’s hand, a sharp intake of breath.

Then the sounds started.

Not bells anymore. Something lower, a grinding hum that vibrated through the phone speaker. It was followed by a skittering, scraping noise, like claws on slate, getting closer. Fast.

“Marisol?” Tasha’s voice, distant and confused. “Is something on the roof?”

A thud shook the line, so heavy it made my mom gasp. Then a shriek—not human, something high and chittering.

A window shattered. A massive, bursting crunch, like something had come straight through the wall.

Then the screams started.

Not just screams of fear. These were sounds of pure, physical terror. Kiana’s high-pitched shriek cut off into a gurgle. Nico wailed, “Mommy!” before his voice was swallowed by a thick, wet thud and a crash of furniture.

“NO! GET AWAY FROM THEM!” My mom’s voice was raw, a warrior’s cry. I heard a grunt of effort, the smash of something heavy—maybe a lamp, a chair—connecting, followed by a hiss that was absolutely not human.

Tasha was cursing, a stream of furious, slurred shouts. There was a scuffle, then a body hitting the floor.

“ROEN!” My mom screamed my name into the phone. It was the last clear word.

A final, piercing shriek was cut short. Then a heavy, dragging sound.

The line hissed with empty static for three heartbeats.

Then it went dead.

The car tore around the last bend. The cabin came into view, every window blazing with light. The front door was gone. Just a dark, open hole.

I slammed on the brakes, the car skidding to a stop fifty yards away.

The car was still ticking when I killed the engine. Maya grabbed my arm. “Roen. Don’t.”

I pulled free. My legs felt numb, like they didn’t belong to me anymore, but they still moved. Every step toward the house felt wrong, like I was walking into a memory that hadn’t happened yet.

The ground between us and the cabin was torn up—deep gouges in the dirt, snapped branches, something dragged straight through the yard. The porch was half gone. The roof sagged in the middle like it had been stepped on.

We desperately called our family’s names. But some part of me already knew no one would answer. The inside smelled wrong. Something metallic and burnt.

The living room barely looked like a room anymore. Furniture smashed flat. Walls cracked. Blood everywhere—smeared, sprayed, soaked into the carpet so dark it almost looked black. Bodies were scattered where people had been standing or running.

Jay was closest to the door. Or what was left of him. His body lay twisted at an angle that didn’t make sense, like he’d been thrown.

Bri was near the hallway. She was facedown, drowned in her own blood. One arm stretched out like she’d been reaching for someone. Malik was farther back, slumped against the wall, eyes open but empty, throat cut clean.

Tasha was near the kitchen. Or what was left of her. Her torso was slashed open, ribs visible through torn fabric. Her head was missing. One hand was clenched around a broken bottle, like she’d tried to fight back even when it was already over.

Maya dropped to her knees.

“No, mommy, no…” she said. Over and over.

I kept moving because if I stopped, I wasn’t sure I’d start again.

My hands were shaking so bad I had to press them into my jeans to steady myself.

“Mom,” I called out, even though I already knew.

The back room was crushed inward like something heavy had landed there.

Mom was on the floor. I knew it was her because she was curled around a smaller body.

Kiana was inside her arms, turned into my mom’s chest. Her head was gone. Just a ragged stump at her neck, soaked dark. My mom’s face was frozen mid-scream, eyes wide, mouth open, teeth bared.

I couldn’t breathe. My chest locked up, and for a second I thought I might pass out standing there. I dropped to my knees anyway.

“I’m sorry,” I said. To both of them. To all of them. Like it might still matter.

Then, something moved.

Not the house settling. Not the wind. This was close. Wet. Fast.

I snapped my head toward the hallway and backed up on instinct, almost slipping in blood. My heart was hammering so hard it felt like it was shaking my teeth loose.

“Maya,” I said, low and sharp. “Get up. Something’s still here.”

She sucked in a breath like she’d been punched and scrambled to her feet, eyes wild. I looked around for anything that wasn’t broken or nailed down.

That’s when I saw my mom’s hand.

Tucked against her wrist, half-hidden by her sleeve, was a revolver. The snub‑nose she kept buried in the back of the closet “just in case.” I’d seen it once, years ago, when she thought my dad was coming back drunk and angry.

I knelt and pried it free, gently, like she might still feel it.

The gun was warm.

I flipped the cylinder open with shaking fingers. Five loaded chambers. One spent casing.

“She got a shot off,” I whispered.

Maya was already moving. She grabbed a bat leaning against the wall near the tree—aluminum, cheap, still wrapped with a torn bow. Jay’s Christmas present. She peeled the plastic off and took a stance like she’d done this before.

The thing scuttled out of the hallway on all fours, moving with a broken, jerky grace. It was all wrong—a patchwork of fur and leathery skin, twisted horns, and eyes that burned like wet matches. It was big, shoulders hunched low to clear the ceiling. And on its flank, a raw, blackened crater wept thick, tar-like blood. My mom’s shot.

Our eyes met. Its jaws unhinged with a sound like cracking ice.

It charged.

I didn’t think. I raised the revolver and pulled the trigger. The first blast was deafening in the shattered room. It hit the thing in the chest, barely slowing it. I fired again. And again. The shots were too fast, my aim wild. I saw chunks of it jerk away. One shot took a piece of its ear. Another sparked off a horn. It was on me.

The smell hit—old blood and wet earth. A claw swiped, ripping my jacket.

That’s when the bat connected.

Maya swung from the side with everything she had. The aluminum thwanged against its knee. Something cracked. The creature buckled. She swung again, a two-handed blow to its ribs. Another sickening crunch.

The creature turned on her, giving me its side. I jammed the barrel of the pistol into its ribcase and fired the last round point-blank. The thing let out a shriek of pure agony.

The creature reeled back, a spray of dark fluid gushing from the new hole in its side. It hissed, legs buckling beneath it. It took a step forward and collapsed hard, one hand clawing at the floor like it still wanted to fight.

I stood there with the revolver hanging useless in my hand, ears ringing, lungs barely working. My jacket, my hands, my face—everything was slick with its blood. Thick, black, warm. It dripped off my fingers and splattered onto the wrecked floor like oil.

I couldn’t move. My brain felt unplugged. Like if I stayed perfectly still, none of this would be real.

“Roen.” Maya’s voice sounded far away. Then closer. “Roen—look at me.”

I didn’t.

She grabbed my wrists hard. Her hands were shaking worse than mine. “Hey. Hey. We have to go. Right now.”

I blinked. My eyes burned. “My mom… Kiana…”

“I know, babe,” she said, voice cracking but steady anyway. “But we can’t stay here.”

Something deep in me fought that. Screamed at me to stay. To do something. To not leave them like this.

Maya tugged me toward the door. I let her.

We stumbled out into the cold night, slipping in the torn-up dirt. The air hit my face and I sucked it in like I’d been underwater too long. The sky above the cabin was alive.

Shapes moved across it—dark figures lifting off from the ground, rising in spirals and lines, mounting beasts that shouldn’t exist. Antlers. Wings. Too many legs. Too many eyes. The sound came back, clearer now: bells, laughter, howling wind.

They rose over the treeline in a long, crooked procession, silhouettes cutting across the moon. And at the front of it— I stopped dead.

The sleigh floated higher than the rest, massive and ornate, pulled by creatures that looked like reindeer only in the loosest sense. Their bodies were stretched wrong, ribs showing through skin, eyes glowing like coals.

At the reins stood him.

Tall. Broad. Wrapped in red that looked stained in blood. His beard hung in clumps, matted and dark. His smile was too wide, teeth too many. A crown of antlers rose from his head, tangled with bells that rang wrong—deep, warped.

He reached down into the sleigh, grabbed something that kicked and screamed, and hauled it up by the arm.

Nico.

My brother thrashed, crying, his small hands clawing at the edge of the sleigh. I saw his face clearly in the firelight—terror, confusion, mouth open as he screamed my name.

“NO!” I tried to run. Maya wrapped her arms around my chest and hauled me back with everything she had.

The figure laughed. A deep, booming sound that echoed through the trees and into my bones. He shoved Nico headfirst into a bulging sack already writhing with movement—other kids, other screams—then tied it shut like it was nothing.

The sleigh lurched forward.The procession surged after it, riders whooping and shrieking as they climbed into the sky.

Something dragged itself out of the cabin behind us.

The wounded creature. The one we thought was dead.

It staggered on three limbs, leaving a thick trail of blood across the porch and into the dirt. It let out a broken, furious cry and launched itself forward as the sleigh passed overhead.

Its claws caught the back rail of the sleigh. It slammed into the side hard, dangling there, legs kicking uselessly as the procession carried it upward. Blood sprayed out behind it in a long, dark arc, raining down through the trees.

For a few seconds, it hung on. Dragged. Refused to let go. Then its grip failed.

The creature fell.

It vanished into the forest below with a distant, wet crash that echoed once and then went silent.

The sleigh didn’t slow.

The Santa thing threw his head back and laughed again, louder this time, like the sound itself was a victory. Then the hunt disappeared into the clouds, the bells fading until there was nothing left but wind and ruined trees and the broken shell of the cabin behind us.

—

We just sat down in the dirt a few yards from the cabin and held onto each other like if we let go, one of us would disappear too.

I don’t know how long it was. Long enough for the cold to stop mattering. Long enough for my hands to go numb around Maya’s jacket. Long enough for my brain to start doing this stupid thing where it kept trying to rewind, like maybe I’d missed a moment where I could’ve done something different.

It was Maya who finally remembered the phone.

“Roen,” she said, voice hoarse. “We have to call the police….”

My hands shook so bad I dropped my phone twice before I managed to unlock the screen. There was dried blood in the cracks of the case. I dialed 911 and put it on speaker because I didn’t trust myself to hold it.

The dispatcher’s voice was calm. Too calm.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

—

The cops showed up fast. Faster than I expected. Two cruisers at first, then more. Red and blue lights flooded the trees like some messed-up holiday display.

They separated us immediately.

Hands up. On your knees. Don’t move.

I remember one of them staring at my jacket, at the black blood smeared down my arms, and his hand never left his gun.

They asked us what happened. Over and over. Separately. Same questions, different words.

I told them there were things in the house. I told them they killed everyone. I told them they weren't human.

That was the exact moment their faces changed.

Not fear. Not concern.

Suspicion.

They cuffed my hands. Maya’s too.

At first, they tried to pin it on me. Or maybe both of us. Kept pressing like we were hiding something, like maybe there was a fight that got out of hand, or we snapped, or it was drugs. Asked where I dumped Nico’s body.

One of the detectives took the revolver out of an evidence bag and set it on the table of the interrogation room like it was a point he’d been waiting to make.

“So you fired this?”

“Yes,” I said. “At the thing.”

“What thing?”

I looked at him. “The thing that killed my family.”

He wrote something down and nodded like that explained everything.

When the forensics team finally showed up and started putting the scene together, it got harder to make it stick. The blood patterns, the way the bodies were torn apart—none of it made sense for a standard attack. Way too violent. Way too messy. Too many injuries that didn’t line up with the weapons they found. No human did that. No animal either, far as they could tell. But they sure as hell weren’t going to write “mythical sky monsters” in the report.

Next theory? My dad.

But he was still locked up. Solid alibi. The detectives even visited him in prison to personally make sure he was still there. After that, they looked at Rick. Tasha’s boyfriend. Only problem? They found him too. What was left of him, anyway. His body was found near the front yard, slumped against a tree. Neck snapped like a twig.

That’s when they got quiet. No more hard questions. Just forms. Statements. A counselor.

We were minors. No surviving family. That part was simple. Child Protect Services got involved.

They wanted to split us up. Said it was temporary, just until they could sort everything out. I got assigned a group home in Clovis. Maya got somewhere in Madera.

—

The day they told me I was getting moved, I didn’t even argue. There wasn’t any fight left. Just this empty numbness that settled behind my ribs and stayed there. The caseworker—Janine or Jenna or something—told me the social worker wanted to talk before the transfer. I figured it was some last-minute paperwork thing.

Instead, they walked me into this windowless office and shut the door behind me.

Maya was already there.

She looked as rough as I felt—pale, shadows under her baby-blue eyes. When she saw me, she blinked like she wasn’t sure I was real. We just stood there for a second.

Then she crossed the room and hugged me so hard it hurt. I held on. Didn’t say anything. Couldn’t.

“Hey,” she said into my shoulder. Her voice shook once. “Hey,” I replied.

“I thought they sent you away already,” I said.

“Almost,” she said. “Guess we got a delay.”

We pulled apart when someone cleared their throat.

I looked up to see a woman already in the room, standing near the wall.

She was in her late thirties, maybe. She didn’t look like a social worker I’d ever seen. Didn’t smell like stale coffee or exhaustion. Black blazer and jeans. Her dark brown hair was cropped short and neat. Her hazel eyes were sharp, measuring, like she was sizing up threats.

She closed the door behind her.

“I’m glad you two got a moment to catch up,” she said calmly. “Please, sit.”

“My name is Agent Sara Benoit,” she said.

The woman waited until we were seated before she spoke again. She didn’t rush it. Let the silence stretch just long enough to feel intentional.

“I know you’ve already talked to the police,” she said. “Multiple times.”

I let out a short, tired laugh. “Then why are we here again?” She looked at me directly. Not through me. Not like I was a problem to solve. “Because I’m not with the police.”

Maya stiffened beside me. I felt it through her sleeve.

I said, “So what? You’re a shrink? This is where you tell us we’re crazy, right?”

Benoit shook her head. “No. This is where I tell you I believe you.”

That landed heavier than any I’d heard so far.

I stared at her. “You… what?”

“I believe there was something non-human involved in the killings at that cabin,” she said. Flat. Like she was reading off a weather report. “I believe what you saw in the sky was real. And I believe the entity you described—what the media will eventually call an animal or a cult or a psychotic break—is none of those things.”

The room was quiet except for the hum of the lights.

Maya spoke up. “They said we were traumatized. That our minds filled in the gaps.”

Benoit nodded. “That’s what they have to say. It keeps things neat.”

That pissed me off more than anything else she could’ve said.

“Neat? I saw my family slaughtered,” I said. My voice stayed level, but it took work. “I watched something dressed like evil Santa kidnap my brother . If you’re about to tell me to move on, don’t.”

Benoit didn’t flinch.

“I’m not here to tell you that,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that what took your brother isn’t untouchable. And what killed your family doesn’t get to walk away clean.”

My chest tightened. Maya’s fingers found mine under the table and locked on.

I shook my head. “The fuck can you do about it? What are you? FBI? CIA? Some Men in Black knockoff with worse suits?”

She smirked at my jab, then reached into her blazer slowly, deliberately, like she didn’t want us to think she was pulling a weapon. She flipped open a leather badge wallet and slid it across the table.

‘NORAD Special Investigations Division’

The seal was real. The badge was heavy. Government ugly. No flair.

“…NORAD?” I said. “What’s that?”

“North American Aerospace Defense Command,” she explained. “Officially, we track airspace. Missiles. Unidentified aircraft. Anything that crosses borders where it shouldn’t.”

“What the hell does fucking NORAD want with us?” I demanded.

Benoit didn’t flinch. She just stated, “I’m here to offer you a choice.”

“A choice?” Maya asked.

She nodded. “Option one: you go to group homes, therapy, court dates. You try to live with what you saw. The official story will be ‘unknown assailants’ and ‘tragic circumstances.’ Your brother will be listed as deceased once the paperwork catches up.”

My chest burned. “And the other option?”

“Option two,” she said, her voice low and steady, “you come with me. You disappear on paper. New names, new files. You train with us. You learn what these things are, and how to kill them. Then you find the ones who did this. You get your brother back, and you make them pay.”",1,1765845588.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False

I'm Going to Get Him Back (Part 1),"When dad got locked up again, it didn’t hit right away. He’d been in and out since I was nine, but this time felt different. Longer sentence. Something about assault with a weapon and parole violations. My mom, Marisol, cried once, then shut down completely. No yelling, no last minute plea to judge for leniency—just silence.

“He’s going away for at least fifteen years.”

It wasn’t news. We all knew. I’d heard her crying about it on the phone to my grandma in the Philippines through the paper-thin wall. My little sister, Kiana heard it too but didn’t say anything. Just curled up on the mattress with his headphones on, pretending she couldn’t.

Then mom couldn’t make rent. The landlord came by with that fake sympathy, like he felt bad but not bad enough to wait one more week for rent before evicting us.

Our house in Fresno was one of those old stucco duplexes with mold in the vents and a broken front fence. Still, it was home.

“We’ll get a fresh start,” Mom said.

And by “fresh start,” she meant a cabin in the Sierra Nevada that looked cheap even in blurry online photos. The only reason it was so affordable was because another family—who was somehow even worse off than we were—was willing to split the cost. We’d “make it work.” Whatever that meant.

I packed my clothes in trash bags. My baby brother, Nico, clutched his PS4 the whole time like someone was gonna steal it. Mom sold the washer and our living room couch for gas money.

When we finally pulled up, the place wasn’t a cabin so much as a box with windows. The woods pressed tight around it like the trees wanted to swallow it whole.

“Looks haunted,” I muttered, stepping out of the car and staring at the place. It had a sagging roof, moss creeping up one side, and a screen door that hung off one hinge like it gave up trying years ago.

Nico’s face scrunched up. “Haunted? For real?”

I shrugged. “Guess we’ll find out tonight.”

“We will?” He whispers.

Mom shot me that look. “Seriously, Roen?” she snapped. “You think this is funny? No, baby, it’s not haunted.” She reassured Nico.

I swung one of the trash bags over my shoulder and headed for the front door. The steps creaked loud under my feet, like even they weren’t sure they could hold me. Just as I reached for the knob— I heard voices. Two people inside, arguing loud enough that I didn’t need to strain to catch it.

“I’m not sharing a room with some random people, Mom!” Said a girl’s voice.

A second voice fired back, older, calmer but tight with frustration. “Maya, we’ve been over this. We don’t have a choice.”

Then I heard footsteps—fast ones, heavy and pissed off, thudding through the cabin toward the door.

Before I could move out of the way or even say anything, the front door flung open hard—right into me. The edge caught me square in the shoulder and chest, knocking the air out of me as I stumbled backward and landed flat on the porch with a loud thump.

“Shit,” I muttered, wincing.

A shadow filled the doorway. I looked up and there she was—the girl, standing over me with wide eyes and a face full of panic.

“Oh my god—I didn’t see you,” she said, breathless. “Are you okay? I didn’t—God, I’m sorry.”

She knelt down a little, hand halfway out like she wasn’t sure if she should help me up or if she’d already done enough damage.

I sat up, rubbing my ribs and trying not to look like it actually hurt as bad as it did. “Yeah,” I grunted. “I mean, it’s just a screen door. Not like it was made of steel or anything.”

I grabbed her outstretched hand. Her grip was stronger than I expected, but her fingers trembled a little.

She looked about my age—sixteen, maybe seventeen—with this messy blonde braid half falling apart and a hoodie that looked like it had been through a few too many wash cycles. Her nails were painted black, chipped down to the corners. She didn’t let go of my hand right away.

Her face changed fast. Like something hot in her just shut off the second our eyes locked. The sharp edge drained out of her expression, like she forgot what she was mad about.

“I didn’t know anyone was standing out here,” she said again, softer this time. “I just... needed air.”

“It’s all good,” I said, brushing dirt off my jeans and trying to gather my spilled stuff. “Not my first time getting knocked down today.”

She glanced awkwardly back inside. “So... guess that means you’re the people we’re sharing this dump with?”

“Yup. The other half of the broke brigade.”

She held out her hand. “I’m Maya.”

I took it. “Roen.”

“Let me guess…say you’re here because of someone else’s screw-up.”

“How’s you know?” I asked surprised.

She shrugged. “Let’s just say you’re not the only one.”

Behind me, Nico whispered, “Is she a ghost?”

Maya raised an eyebrow. “Who's that?”

“My brother. He’s eight. He’s gonna ask a million questions, so get ready.”

She smirked. “Bring it on. I’ve survived worse.” I believed her.

Kiana was already climbing out of the car, dragging her own trash bag behind her, when she caught sight of me and Maya still talking.

“Ohhh,” she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, drawing out the sound with a stupid grin. “Roen’s already got a girlfriend in the woods.”

I rolled my eyes. “Shut up, Kiana.”

Maya snorted but didn’t say anything, just crossed her arms and waited like she was curious how this was gonna play out.

“I’m just saying,” she whispered, “you’ve known her for like two minutes and you’re already helping each other off the porch like it’s a rom-com.”

“You’re not even supposed to know what that is.” “I’m twelve, not dumb.”

“She’s cute,” Kiana added, smirking now as she walked past. “Y’all gonna braid each other’s hair later?”

“I swear to god—”

“Language,” Mom chided from behind me.

Before I could fire back, the front door creaked open again, and a woman stepped out. Thin, wiry frame. She wore a faded flannel and sweatpants like she’d stopped trying to impress anyone years ago. Her eyes darted across us—counting, maybe—and her smile didn’t quite reach all the way up.

“You must be the Mayumis,” she said. Her voice was raspy, probably from too many cigarettes or too many bad nights. Maybe both. “I’m Tasha. Tasha Foster.”

She stepped closer, and the smell hit me—sharp and bitter. Whiskey.

Mom appeared behind us just in time. “Hi, I’m Marisol,” she said quietly, arms crossed like she already regretted every decision that led us here.

They hugged briefly. More of a press of shoulders than a real embrace. Tasha nodded toward the cabin. “We’re tight on space, but we cleared out the back room. Me, you, and the girls can take that. The boys can have the den.”

“Boys?” I asked, stepping into the doorway and immediately getting swarmed by noise.

Inside, it looked like someone tried to clean but gave up halfway through. There were dishes drying on one side of the sink, and unfolded laundry piled on the couch. A crusty pizza box sat on the counter next to an open bottle of something that definitely wasn’t juice.

Then came the thundering feet—three of them. First was a chubby kid with wild curls and a superhero shirt that was two sizes too small. He stopped, blinked at us, then just yelled, “New people!”

A girl around Kiana’s age followed, hair in tight braids and a glare that said she didn’t trust any of us. Behind her was a tall, lanky boy with headphones around his neck and that look teens get when they’re stuck somewhere they hate.

Maya rolled her eyes. “These are my siblings. That loud one’s Jay, the girl with the death stare is Bri, and the quiet one’s Malik.”

Jay darted toward Nico immediately, pointing at the PS4. “You got games?!”

Nico lit up. “A bunch.”

Mom and Tasha slipped into the kitchen to talk in low voices while the rest of us stood there in this weird moment of strangers under one roof.

Maya looked around at the chaos. “So… welcome to the party.”

“Some party,” I muttered, but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth.

Kiana elbowed me. “I like it here,” she said.

—

Starting a new school in the middle of the year is trash. No one tells you where anything is, teachers already have favorites, and everybody’s locked into their little cliques like they’re afraid being friendly’s contagious.

Maya and I ended up in the same homeroom, which helped. It was the only part of the day that didn’t feel like I was walking into someone else’s house uninvited. She sat two rows over at first, headphones in, scribbling in the margins of a beat-up copy of The Bell Jar. I didn’t even know she read stuff like that.

We got paired up in Physics too—lab partners. I’m more of the “just tell me what to do and I’ll do it” type when it comes to school. I play ball. Football mostly, but I’m decent at track. Maya actually liked the subject. Asked questions. Took notes like they meant something. The first week, I thought we’d hate working together—like she’d think I was an idiot or something—but it wasn’t like that. She explained things without making it weird.

She’d let me copy her answers—but only after I tried to understand them first.

At lunch, she sat outside under the trees near the side parking lot. Alone at first. I started joining her, ditching my usual spot with the guys.

I soon found out why she kept to herself. It started small. A few whispers behind cupped hands, little laughs when Maya walked past in the hallway. She didn’t react at first, just rolled her eyes and kept walking. But I saw the tightness in her jaw. The way her grip on her backpack straps got a little firmer.

Then one day, someone didn’t bother whispering.

The comments started behind her back—“Isn’t she the one with the crackhead mom?”, “Heard she’s got, like, four half-siblings. All different dads.”

I felt Maya tense beside me. Not flinch—just go still, like something inside her snapped into place. She didn’t say anything. Didn’t even look at them. She just turned and walked fast, then faster, then she was running down the hall.

“Yo,” I called after her, but she was already gone. I spun back to the group gossiping.

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I snapped. Heads turned. Good.

One of the guys laughed. “Relax, man. It’s just facts.”

“Facts?” I stepped closer. “You don’t know shit about her.”

The girl rolled her eyes. “She’s gonna end up just like her mom anyway. Everyone knows that.”

“Oh fuck off!” I shouted. I didn’t wait. I took off after Maya.

I checked the bathroom first. Empty. Then the quad. Nothing. My last period bell rang, but I didn’t care. I headed to the library because it was the only quiet place left in this school.

She was tucked into the far back corner, half-hidden behind the tall shelves nobody ever went to. Sitting on the floor. Knees pulled in. Hoodie sleeve pushed up.

My stomach dropped.

“Maya,” I said, low. Careful.

She didn’t look up.

I took a few slow steps closer and saw it—the razor in her hand.

Her arm was a roadmap of old lines. Some faded. Some not.

“Hey,” I said, softer now. “Don’t.”

Her hand paused.

“You’re not allowed to say that,” she muttered. Her voice was wrecked. “You don’t get to stop me.”

“I know,” I said. “But I’m asking anyway.”

She laughed once, sharp and ugly. “They’re right, you know. About me. About all of it.”

I crouched down in front of her, keeping my hands where she could see them. “They don’t know you.”

“They know enough,” she said. “My mom’s an addict. She disappears for days. Sometimes weeks. We all got different dads. None of them stuck. People hear that and they already got my ending figured out.”

“You’re not,” I said.

She lifted the razor slightly. “You don’t know that.”

She finally looked at me. Her blue eyes were red, furious, tired. “You think I don’t see it? I’m already halfway there.”

I swallowed. “I know what it’s like when everyone assumes you’re trash because of who raised you.” That got her attention.

“My dad’s been locked up most of my life,” I said. “I’ve got scars too.” I tapped my knuckles. Old marks. “From standing up to him when I shouldn’t have. From thinking I could fix things if I just tried harder.” She stared at my hands like she was seeing them for the first time.

“I used to think if I didn’t fight back, I’d turn into him,” I went on. “Turns out, fighting him didn’t make me better either. Just made everything louder.”

Her grip on the razor loosened a little.

I reached out slowly. “Can you give me that?”

She hesitated. Long enough that my heart was pounding in my ears. Then she dropped the razor into my palm like it weighed a thousand pounds.

She covered her face and finally broke.

I stayed there. Didn’t try to fix it. Didn’t say the wrong hopeful crap. Just sat on the library floor with her while she cried it out.

— ​​That night, I knocked on Maya’s door after everyone had crashed.

“I have an idea,” I whispered. “It’s mean though…” Maya smirked. “The meaner the better.”

That morning, we showed up to school early. We had backpacks full of supplies—a screwdriver, glitter, expired sardines, and four tiny tubes of industrial-strength superglue.

We snuck into the locker hallway when the janitor went for his smoke break. Maya kept lookout while I unscrewed the hinges on three locker doors—each one belonging to the worst of the trash-talkers. We laced the inside edges with glue, so when they slammed shut like usual, they’d stay that way.

Inside one of them, we left a glitter bomb rigged to pop the second the door opened. In another, Maya stuffed the expired sardines into a pencil pouch and superglued that shut too. The smell would hit like a punch in the face.

We barely made it to homeroom before the chaos started.

First period: screaming from the hallway. Second period: a janitor with bolt cutters. By third period, the whole school was buzzing.

And then we got called to the office.

We got caught on cameras. Of course. We didn’t even try to lie. Just sat there while the vice principal read us the suspension notice like he was personally offended.

“Three days. Home. No extracurriculars. You’re lucky we’re not calling the police.”

Outside the office, Maya bumped my shoulder. “Worth it?”

I grinned. “Every second.”

—

I got my permit that November. Mom let me borrow the car sometimes, mostly because she was too tired to argue. We made it count—gas station dinners, thrift store photo shoots, late-night drives to nowhere.

We’d sneak out some nights just to lie in the truck bed and stare at the stars through the trees, counting satellites and pretending they were escape pods.

The first time she kissed me, it wasn’t planned. We were sitting in the school parking lot, waiting for the rain to let up. She just looked over and said, “I’m gonna do something stupid,” then leaned in before I could ask what. After that, it all moved fast.

The first time we had sex was in the back of the car, parked on an old forestry road, all fumbling hands and held breath. We thought we were careful.

The scare happened two weeks later. A late period, a pregnancy test from the pharmacy. The longest three minutes of our lives, standing in that cabin’s moldy bathroom, waiting. When it was negative, we didn’t celebrate. She laughed. I almost cried.

After that, we thought more about the future. Maya started talking about college more. Somewhere far. I didn’t have plans like that, but I was working weekends at the pizza shop, and started saving. Not for clothes or games—just for getting out.

—

By December, things settled down a bit. We tried to make the best of the holidays. All month, the cabin smelled like pine and mildew and cheap cinnamon candles. We’d managed to scrape together some decorations—paper snowflakes, a string of busted lights that only half worked, and a sad fake tree we found at the thrift store for five bucks. Nico hung plastic ornaments like it was the real deal. Kiana made hot cocoa from a dollar store mix and forced everyone to drink it. Mom even smiled a few times, though it never lasted.

Maya and I did our part. Helped the little kids wrap presents in newspaper. Made jokes about how Santa probably skipped our cabin because the GPS gave up halfway up the mountain.

Even Tasha seemed mellow for once.

But then Christmas Eve hit.

Maya’s mom announced that afternoon she was inviting her new boyfriend over for dinner. Some dude named Rick or Rich or something. Maya went quiet first, then full-on exploded.

“You’re kidding, right?” she snapped. “You’re really bringing some random guy here? On Christmas Eve?”

Tasha shrugged like it was no big deal. “He’s not random. I’ve known him for months.”

“And that makes it fucking okay? And now we’re supposed to play happy family?”

“Watch your mouth.”

“Or what? You’ll vanish for a week and pretend this never happened?”

Tasha lit a cigarette inside the house, which she only did when she was mad. “It’s my house, Maya. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”

Maya laughed. “Gladly.”

She grabbed her bag and was out the door before I could say anything. I followed.

We sat on the steps while the cold settled into our bones. She didn’t talk. Just stared out at the trees, fists clenched in her lap like she was holding herself together by force. I leaned over, bumped her shoulder.

“Let’s bounce.”

She looked at me. “Where?""

“Anywhere but here.”

So we sneaked out. I borrowed Mom’s car.

We drove up to a dirt road, way up past the ranger station, where the trees cleared and gave you this wide, unreal view of the valley below. You could see for miles.

I popped the trunk, and we sat with our legs hanging out the back, wrapped in a blanket. I pulled out the six-pack I’d stashed—some knockoff lager from that corner store near school that never asked questions. Maya lit a joint she’d swiped from her mom’s stash and passed it to me without saying anything.

We just sat there, knees touching, sipping beer and smoking the joint, watching our breath cloud up in the freezing air. Maya played music off her phone, low. Some old indie Christmas playlist she’d downloaded for the irony.

At one point, she leaned her head on my shoulder.

“Thanks,” she whispered.

“For what?”

“For giving me something that doesn’t suck.”

—

Maya was humming some half-forgotten carol when I noticed it—this streak of light cutting across the night sky, low and fast. At first I thought it was just a shooting star, but it didn’t fizzle out like it was supposed to. It curved. Like it was changing direction. Like it knew where it was going.

“Did you see that?” I asked.

She lifted her head. “What?”

I pointed. “That...”

Maya squinted. “What am I supposed to be looking at?” I fumbled the binoculars from the glovebox—old ones my uncle gave me for spotting deer. I raised them to my eyes.

I held them up so that Maya could see too, adjusted the focus, and froze.

Maya noticed right away. “What? What is it?”

Through the binoculars, there were figures—too many to count, all of them fast. Not like planes. More like shadows ripping across the sky, riding... something. Horses, maybe. Or things shaped like horses but wrong. Twisted. And riders—tall, thin figures wrapped in cloaks that whipped in the wind, some with skull faces, some with no faces at all. Weapons glinted in their hands. Swords. Spears. Chains.

“Oh. No,” Maya whispered.

“What is it?” I asked.

She looked at me. “It’s heading towards the cabin.”

I snatched the binoculars back, my hands shaking so hard the image blurred. It took me three tries to steady them against my face.

She was right.

The things weren’t just in the sky anymore. They were descending, a dark wave pouring down the tree line toward the base of the mountain. Toward our road. Toward the cabin.

“We have to go. Now.”

We scrambled into the car. I spun the tires in the dirt, wrenching the wheel toward home. The headlights carved a shaky path through the dark as we flew down the mountain road, branches slapping the windshield. “Call my mom,” I told Maya, handing my phone to her. “Put it on speaker.” The ringing seemed to last forever. Mom picked up.

“Roen? Where are you? Where’s the car?” The anger was a live wire.

“Mom, listen! You have to get everyone inside. Lock the doors. Right now.”

“What are you talking about? Are you in trouble?”

“Mom, no! Listen! There’s something coming. From the sky. We saw it. It’s coming down the mountain toward the cabin.”

A beat of dead silence. Then her tone, cold and disbelieving. “Have you been doing drugs? Is Maya with you?”

“Mom, I swear to God, I’m… Please, just look outside. Go to a window and look up toward the ridge.”

“I’m looking, Roen. I don’t see anything but trees and…” She trailed off. I heard a faint, distant sound through the phone, like bells, but twisted and metallic. “What is that noise?”

Then, Nico’s voice, excited in the background. “Mom! Mom! Look! It’s Santa’s sleigh! I see the lights!”

Kiana joined in. “Whoa! Are those reindeer?”

“Kids, get back from the window,” Mom said, but her voice had changed. The anger was gone, replaced by a slow-dawning confusion. The bells were louder now, mixed with a sound like wind tearing through a canyon.

“Mom, it’s NOT Santa!” I was yelling, my foot pressing the accelerator to the floor. The car fishtailed on a gravel curve. “Get everyone and run into the woods! Now!”

The line went quiet for one second too long. Not dead quiet—I could hear the muffled rustle of the phone in my mom’s hand, a sharp intake of breath.

Then the sounds started.

Not bells anymore. Something lower, a grinding hum that vibrated through the phone speaker. It was followed by a skittering, scraping noise, like claws on slate, getting closer. Fast.

“Marisol?” Tasha’s voice, distant and confused. “Is something on the roof?”

A thud shook the line, so heavy it made my mom gasp. Then a shriek—not human, something high and chittering.

A window shattered. A massive, bursting crunch, like something had come straight through the wall.

Then the screams started.

Not just screams of fear. These were sounds of pure, physical terror. Kiana’s high-pitched shriek cut off into a gurgle. Nico wailed, “Mommy!” before his voice was swallowed by a thick, wet thud and a crash of furniture.

“NO! GET AWAY FROM THEM!” My mom’s voice was raw, a warrior’s cry. I heard a grunt of effort, the smash of something heavy—maybe a lamp, a chair—connecting, followed by a hiss that was absolutely not human.

Tasha was cursing, a stream of furious, slurred shouts. There was a scuffle, then a body hitting the floor.

“ROEN!” My mom screamed my name into the phone. It was the last clear word.

A final, piercing shriek was cut short. Then a heavy, dragging sound.

The line hissed with empty static for three heartbeats.

Then it went dead.

The car tore around the last bend. The cabin came into view, every window blazing with light. The front door was gone. Just a dark, open hole.

I slammed on the brakes, the car skidding to a stop fifty yards away.

The car was still ticking when I killed the engine. Maya grabbed my arm. “Roen. Don’t.”

I pulled free. My legs felt numb, like they didn’t belong to me anymore, but they still moved. Every step toward the house felt wrong, like I was walking into a memory that hadn’t happened yet.

The ground between us and the cabin was torn up—deep gouges in the dirt, snapped branches, something dragged straight through the yard. The porch was half gone. The roof sagged in the middle like it had been stepped on.

We desperately called our family’s names. But some part of me already knew no one would answer. The inside smelled wrong. Something metallic and burnt.

The living room barely looked like a room anymore. Furniture smashed flat. Walls cracked. Blood everywhere—smeared, sprayed, soaked into the carpet so dark it almost looked black. Bodies were scattered where people had been standing or running.

Jay was closest to the door. Or what was left of him. His body lay twisted at an angle that didn’t make sense, like he’d been thrown.

Bri was near the hallway. She was facedown, drowned in her own blood. One arm stretched out like she’d been reaching for someone. Malik was farther back, slumped against the wall, eyes open but empty, throat cut clean.

Tasha was near the kitchen. Or what was left of her. Her torso was slashed open, ribs visible through torn fabric. Her head was missing. One hand was clenched around a broken bottle, like she’d tried to fight back even when it was already over.

Maya dropped to her knees.

“No, mommy, no…” she said. Over and over.

I kept moving because if I stopped, I wasn’t sure I’d start again.

My hands were shaking so bad I had to press them into my jeans to steady myself.

“Mom,” I called out, even though I already knew.

The back room was crushed inward like something heavy had landed there.

Mom was on the floor. I knew it was her because she was curled around a smaller body.

Kiana was inside her arms, turned into my mom’s chest. Her head was gone. Just a ragged stump at her neck, soaked dark. My mom’s face was frozen mid-scream, eyes wide, mouth open, teeth bared.

I couldn’t breathe. My chest locked up, and for a second I thought I might pass out standing there. I dropped to my knees anyway.

“I’m sorry,” I said. To both of them. To all of them. Like it might still matter.

Then, something moved.

Not the house settling. Not the wind. This was close. Wet. Fast.

I snapped my head toward the hallway and backed up on instinct, almost slipping in blood. My heart was hammering so hard it felt like it was shaking my teeth loose.

“Maya,” I said, low and sharp. “Get up. Something’s still here.”

She sucked in a breath like she’d been punched and scrambled to her feet, eyes wild. I looked around for anything that wasn’t broken or nailed down.

That’s when I saw my mom’s hand.

Tucked against her wrist, half-hidden by her sleeve, was a revolver. The snub‑nose she kept buried in the back of the closet “just in case.” I’d seen it once, years ago, when she thought my dad was coming back drunk and angry.

I knelt and pried it free, gently, like she might still feel it.

The gun was warm.

I flipped the cylinder open with shaking fingers. Five loaded chambers. One spent casing.

“She got a shot off,” I whispered.

Maya was already moving. She grabbed a bat leaning against the wall near the tree—aluminum, cheap, still wrapped with a torn bow. Jay’s Christmas present. She peeled the plastic off and took a stance like she’d done this before.

The thing scuttled out of the hallway on all fours, moving with a broken, jerky grace. It was all wrong—a patchwork of fur and leathery skin, twisted horns, and eyes that burned like wet matches. It was big, shoulders hunched low to clear the ceiling. And on its flank, a raw, blackened crater wept thick, tar-like blood. My mom’s shot.

Our eyes met. Its jaws unhinged with a sound like cracking ice.

It charged.

I didn’t think. I raised the revolver and pulled the trigger. The first blast was deafening in the shattered room. It hit the thing in the chest, barely slowing it. I fired again. And again. The shots were too fast, my aim wild. I saw chunks of it jerk away. One shot took a piece of its ear. Another sparked off a horn. It was on me.

The smell hit—old blood and wet earth. A claw swiped, ripping my jacket.

That’s when the bat connected.

Maya swung from the side with everything she had. The aluminum thwanged against its knee. Something cracked. The creature buckled. She swung again, a two-handed blow to its ribs. Another sickening crunch.

The creature turned on her, giving me its side. I jammed the barrel of the pistol into its ribcase and fired the last round point-blank. The thing let out a shriek of pure agony.

The creature reeled back, a spray of dark fluid gushing from the new hole in its side. It hissed, legs buckling beneath it. It took a step forward and collapsed hard, one hand clawing at the floor like it still wanted to fight.

I stood there with the revolver hanging useless in my hand, ears ringing, lungs barely working. My jacket, my hands, my face—everything was slick with its blood. Thick, black, warm. It dripped off my fingers and splattered onto the wrecked floor like oil.

I couldn’t move. My brain felt unplugged. Like if I stayed perfectly still, none of this would be real.

“Roen.” Maya’s voice sounded far away. Then closer. “Roen—look at me.”

I didn’t.

She grabbed my wrists hard. Her hands were shaking worse than mine. “Hey. Hey. We have to go. Right now.”

I blinked. My eyes burned. “My mom… Kiana…”

“I know, babe,” she said, voice cracking but steady anyway. “But we can’t stay here.”

Something deep in me fought that. Screamed at me to stay. To do something. To not leave them like this.

Maya tugged me toward the door. I let her.

We stumbled out into the cold night, slipping in the torn-up dirt. The air hit my face and I sucked it in like I’d been underwater too long. The sky above the cabin was alive.

Shapes moved across it—dark figures lifting off from the ground, rising in spirals and lines, mounting beasts that shouldn’t exist. Antlers. Wings. Too many legs. Too many eyes. The sound came back, clearer now: bells, laughter, howling wind.

They rose over the treeline in a long, crooked procession, silhouettes cutting across the moon. And at the front of it— I stopped dead.

The sleigh floated higher than the rest, massive and ornate, pulled by creatures that looked like reindeer only in the loosest sense. Their bodies were stretched wrong, ribs showing through skin, eyes glowing like coals.

At the reins stood him.

Tall. Broad. Wrapped in red that looked stained in blood. His beard hung in clumps, matted and dark. His smile was too wide, teeth too many. A crown of antlers rose from his head, tangled with bells that rang wrong—deep, warped.

He reached down into the sleigh, grabbed something that kicked and screamed, and hauled it up by the arm.

Nico.

My brother thrashed, crying, his small hands clawing at the edge of the sleigh. I saw his face clearly in the firelight—terror, confusion, mouth open as he screamed my name.

“NO!” I tried to run. Maya wrapped her arms around my chest and hauled me back with everything she had.

The figure laughed. A deep, booming sound that echoed through the trees and into my bones. He shoved Nico headfirst into a bulging sack already writhing with movement—other kids, other screams—then tied it shut like it was nothing.

The sleigh lurched forward.The procession surged after it, riders whooping and shrieking as they climbed into the sky.

Something dragged itself out of the cabin behind us.

The wounded creature. The one we thought was dead.

It staggered on three limbs, leaving a thick trail of blood across the porch and into the dirt. It let out a broken, furious cry and launched itself forward as the sleigh passed overhead.

Its claws caught the back rail of the sleigh. It slammed into the side hard, dangling there, legs kicking uselessly as the procession carried it upward. Blood sprayed out behind it in a long, dark arc, raining down through the trees.

For a few seconds, it hung on. Dragged. Refused to let go. Then its grip failed.

The creature fell.

It vanished into the forest below with a distant, wet crash that echoed once and then went silent.

The sleigh didn’t slow.

The Santa thing threw his head back and laughed again, louder this time, like the sound itself was a victory. Then the hunt disappeared into the clouds, the bells fading until there was nothing left but wind and ruined trees and the broken shell of the cabin behind us.

—

We just sat down in the dirt a few yards from the cabin and held onto each other like if we let go, one of us would disappear too.

I don’t know how long it was. Long enough for the cold to stop mattering. Long enough for my hands to go numb around Maya’s jacket. Long enough for my brain to start doing this stupid thing where it kept trying to rewind, like maybe I’d missed a moment where I could’ve done something different.

It was Maya who finally remembered the phone.

“Roen,” she said, voice hoarse. “We have to call the police….”

My hands shook so bad I dropped my phone twice before I managed to unlock the screen. There was dried blood in the cracks of the case. I dialed 911 and put it on speaker because I didn’t trust myself to hold it.

The dispatcher’s voice was calm. Too calm.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

—

The cops showed up fast. Faster than I expected. Two cruisers at first, then more. Red and blue lights flooded the trees like some messed-up holiday display.

They separated us immediately.

Hands up. On your knees. Don’t move.

I remember one of them staring at my jacket, at the black blood smeared down my arms, and his hand never left his gun.

They asked us what happened. Over and over. Separately. Same questions, different words.

I told them there were things in the house. I told them they killed everyone. I told them they weren't human.

That was the exact moment their faces changed.

Not fear. Not concern.

Suspicion.

They cuffed my hands. Maya’s too.

At first, they tried to pin it on me. Or maybe both of us. Kept pressing like we were hiding something, like maybe there was a fight that got out of hand, or we snapped, or it was drugs. Asked where I dumped Nico’s body.

One of the detectives took the revolver out of an evidence bag and set it on the table of the interrogation room like it was a point he’d been waiting to make.

“So you fired this?”

“Yes,” I said. “At the thing.”

“What thing?”

I looked at him. “The thing that killed my family.”

He wrote something down and nodded like that explained everything.

When the forensics team finally showed up and started putting the scene together, it got harder to make it stick. The blood patterns, the way the bodies were torn apart—none of it made sense for a standard attack. Way too violent. Way too messy. Too many injuries that didn’t line up with the weapons they found. No human did that. No animal either, far as they could tell. But they sure as hell weren’t going to write “mythical sky monsters” in the report.

Next theory? My dad.

But he was still locked up. Solid alibi. The detectives even visited him in prison to personally make sure he was still there. After that, they looked at Rick. Tasha’s boyfriend. Only problem? They found him too. What was left of him, anyway. His body was found near the front yard, slumped against a tree. Neck snapped like a twig.

That’s when they got quiet. No more hard questions. Just forms. Statements. A counselor.

We were minors. No surviving family. That part was simple. Child Protect Services got involved.

They wanted to split us up. Said it was temporary, just until they could sort everything out. I got assigned a group home in Clovis. Maya got somewhere in Madera.

—

The day they told me I was getting moved, I didn’t even argue. There wasn’t any fight left. Just this empty numbness that settled behind my ribs and stayed there. The caseworker—Janine or Jenna or something—told me the social worker wanted to talk before the transfer. I figured it was some last-minute paperwork thing.

Instead, they walked me into this windowless office and shut the door behind me.

Maya was already there.

She looked as rough as I felt—pale, shadows under her baby-blue eyes. When she saw me, she blinked like she wasn’t sure I was real. We just stood there for a second.

Then she crossed the room and hugged me so hard it hurt. I held on. Didn’t say anything. Couldn’t.

“Hey,” she said into my shoulder. Her voice shook once. “Hey,” I replied.

“I thought they sent you away already,” I said.

“Almost,” she said. “Guess we got a delay.”

We pulled apart when someone cleared their throat.

I looked up to see a woman already in the room, standing near the wall.

She was in her late thirties, maybe. She didn’t look like a social worker I’d ever seen. Didn’t smell like stale coffee or exhaustion. Black blazer and jeans. Her dark brown hair was cropped short and neat. Her hazel eyes were sharp, measuring, like she was sizing up threats.

She closed the door behind her.

“I’m glad you two got a moment to catch up,” she said calmly. “Please, sit.”

“My name is Agent Sara Benoit,” she said.

The woman waited until we were seated before she spoke again. She didn’t rush it. Let the silence stretch just long enough to feel intentional.

“I know you’ve already talked to the police,” she said. “Multiple times.”

I let out a short, tired laugh. “Then why are we here again?” She looked at me directly. Not through me. Not like I was a problem to solve. “Because I’m not with the police.”

Maya stiffened beside me. I felt it through her sleeve.

I said, “So what? You’re a shrink? This is where you tell us we’re crazy, right?”

Benoit shook her head. “No. This is where I tell you I believe you.”

That landed heavier than any I’d heard so far.

I stared at her. “You… what?”

“I believe there was something non-human involved in the killings at that cabin,” she said. Flat. Like she was reading off a weather report. “I believe what you saw in the sky was real. And I believe the entity you described—what the media will eventually call an animal or a cult or a psychotic break—is none of those things.”

The room was quiet except for the hum of the lights.

Maya spoke up. “They said we were traumatized. That our minds filled in the gaps.”

Benoit nodded. “That’s what they have to say. It keeps things neat.”

That pissed me off more than anything else she could’ve said.

“Neat? I saw my family slaughtered,” I said. My voice stayed level, but it took work. “I watched something dressed like evil Santa kidnap my brother . If you’re about to tell me to move on, don’t.”

Benoit didn’t flinch.

“I’m not here to tell you that,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that what took your brother isn’t untouchable. And what killed your family doesn’t get to walk away clean.”

My chest tightened. Maya’s fingers found mine under the table and locked on.

I shook my head. “The fuck can you do about it? What are you? FBI? CIA? Some Men in Black knockoff with worse suits?”

She smirked at my jab, then reached into her blazer slowly, deliberately, like she didn’t want us to think she was pulling a weapon. She flipped open a leather badge wallet and slid it across the table.

‘NORAD Special Investigations Division’

The seal was real. The badge was heavy. Government ugly. No flair.

“…NORAD?” I said. “What’s that?”

“North American Aerospace Defense Command,” she explained. “Officially, we track airspace. Missiles. Unidentified aircraft. Anything that crosses borders where it shouldn’t.”

“What the hell does fucking NORAD want with us?” I demanded.

Benoit didn’t flinch. She just stated, “I’m here to offer you a choice.”

“A choice?” Maya asked.

She nodded. “Option one: you go to group homes, therapy, court dates. You try to live with what you saw. The official story will be ‘unknown assailants’ and ‘tragic circumstances.’ Your brother will be listed as deceased once the paperwork catches up.”

My chest burned. “And the other option?”

“Option two,” she said, her voice low and steady, “you come with me. You disappear on paper. New names, new files. You train with us. You learn what these things are, and how to kill them. Then you find the ones who did this. You get your brother back, and you make them pay.”",1,1765845555.0,Viidith22,0,1.0,False

I 44f found out that my 47m fiancé and my best friend 39f that i have known for 14yrs have been cheating, now both are cut off, don't want out to do with them. I found out by going through his phone as he always accused me of cheating, now when I found out they both said nothing physical happened. And it was just messaging for a few weeks. Now my best friend tried to take her own life over this, she left him a letter and told him about her messaging someone else but did not name him, I said to her if she wanted any chance of sorting her marriage out she needs to tell him who it was and how long its been going on for. Which she did and they are working things out. Now my ex fiancé has been saying for the last few weeks it was longer than they said and there was more that happened. I have recently found out she invited him round for coffee and they had (let's say) sexual contact. Now he's admitted to it and he is the one who told me, now when this all took place was at the end of July beginning of August this year. Now I messaged her to say I have been told new information and for her to think about if there is anything else she needs to add. She then went on to say "" he forced himself on her"". So basically they both lied from day one and something physical happened. Now I have the screen shot of the admitted contact, this is where I am in a tight spot, do I now send these messages to her husband who I think has the right to know, or do I just leave it, as she has stated in the messages to me that he dose not want to talk or comment or be messaged about this situation and I should respect that!

To me the opening is a bit like EDL Floral Fantasy (like a plum rose patchouli mixture? But lighter, milder). 

And I’m surprised but the dry down is quite different? Like a toasted marshmallow vanilla similar to Aries/Bonfire Bash. Most of the floral notes fade away. 

It’s only my second time wearing the fragrance so I dunno if it’ll change. But pretty unexpected. I was wondering where the vanilla scent was coming from. 

The fragrance notes for Midnight Addiction is: ripe plum, rich almond flower, and addictive coffee bean. 

Here are the notes for YSL Black Opium Eau de Parfum (not sure which version is closest to Midnight Addiction)
> Black Opium Eau de Parfum is the seductively intoxicating women’s fragrance. The opening notes of adrenaline-rich coffee and the sweet sensuality of vanilla recline into the softness of white flowers creating a long-lasting perfume.

> About the fragrance: This seductive women's perfume is inspired by the edgy and daring woman. Emboldened by the strong scent of coffee, the sensuous warm floral vanilla perfume captivates the senses with a sweet vanilla base and a burst of floral at the heart of the fragrance.

I guess there is vanilla in the inspiration. White florals? Y’know now I read the description i do get something powdery that reminds me of Moonlight Path a smidge. Just in the opening. I do think coffee is more distinct in the YSL Black Opium perfumes rather than Midnight Addiction. ",1,1765845428.0,bathandbodyworks,0,1.0,False

I'm Going to Get Him Back (Part 1),"When dad got locked up again, it didn’t hit right away. He’d been in and out since I was nine, but this time felt different. Longer sentence. Something about assault with a weapon and parole violations. My mom, Marisol, cried once, then shut down completely. No yelling, no last minute plea to judge for leniency—just silence.

“He’s going away for at least fifteen years.”

It wasn’t news. We all knew. I’d heard her crying about it on the phone to my grandma in the Philippines through the paper-thin wall. My little sister, Kiana heard it too but didn’t say anything. Just curled up on the mattress with his headphones on, pretending she couldn’t. 

Then mom couldn’t make rent. The landlord came by with that fake sympathy, like he felt bad but not bad enough to wait one more week for rent before evicting us. 

Our house in Fresno was one of those old stucco duplexes with mold in the vents and a broken front fence. Still, it was home. 

“We’ll get a fresh start,” Mom said.

And by “fresh start,” she meant a cabin in the Sierra Nevada that looked cheap even in blurry online photos. The only reason it was so affordable was because another family—who was somehow even worse off than we were—was willing to split the cost. We’d “make it work.” Whatever that meant.

I packed my clothes in trash bags. My baby brother, Nico, clutched his PS4 the whole time like someone was gonna steal it. Mom sold the washer and our living room couch for gas money.

When we finally pulled up, the place wasn’t a cabin so much as a box with windows. The woods pressed tight around it like the trees wanted to swallow it whole.

“Looks haunted,” I muttered, stepping out of the car and staring at the place. It had a sagging roof, moss creeping up one side, and a screen door that hung off one hinge like it gave up trying years ago.

Nico’s face scrunched up. “Haunted? For real?”

I shrugged. “Guess we’ll find out tonight.”

“We will?” He whispers.

Mom shot me that look. “Seriously, Roen?” she snapped. “You think this is funny? No, baby, it’s not haunted.” She reassured Nico.

I swung one of the trash bags over my shoulder and headed for the front door. The steps creaked loud under my feet, like even they weren’t sure they could hold me. Just as I reached for the knob—
I heard voices. Two people inside, arguing loud enough that I didn’t need to strain to catch it.

“I’m not sharing a room with some random people, Mom!” Said a girl’s voice. 

A second voice fired back, older, calmer but tight with frustration. “Maya, we’ve been over this. We don’t have a choice.”

Then I heard footsteps—fast ones, heavy and pissed off, thudding through the cabin toward the door.

Before I could move out of the way or even say anything, the front door flung open hard—right into me. The edge caught me square in the shoulder and chest, knocking the air out of me as I stumbled backward and landed flat on the porch with a loud thump.

“Shit,” I muttered, wincing.

A shadow filled the doorway. I looked up and there she was—the girl, standing over me with wide eyes and a face full of panic.

“Oh my god—I didn’t see you,” she said, breathless. “Are you okay? I didn’t—God, I’m sorry.”

She knelt down a little, hand halfway out like she wasn’t sure if she should help me up or if she’d already done enough damage.

I sat up, rubbing my ribs and trying not to look like it actually hurt as bad as it did. “Yeah,” I grunted. “I mean, it’s just a screen door. Not like it was made of steel or anything.”

I grabbed her outstretched hand. Her grip was stronger than I expected, but her fingers trembled a little.

She looked about my age—sixteen, maybe seventeen—with this messy blonde braid half falling apart and a hoodie that looked like it had been through a few too many wash cycles. Her nails were painted black, chipped down to the corners. She didn’t let go of my hand right away.

Her face changed fast. Like something hot in her just shut off the second our eyes locked. The sharp edge drained out of her expression, like she forgot what she was mad about.

“I didn’t know anyone was standing out here,” she said again, softer this time. “I just... needed air.”

“It’s all good,” I said, brushing dirt off my jeans and trying to gather my spilled stuff. “Not my first time getting knocked down today.”

She glanced awkwardly back inside. “So... guess that means you’re the people we’re sharing this dump with?”

“Yup. The other half of the broke brigade.”

She held out her hand. “I’m Maya.”

I took it. “Roen.”

“Let me guess…say you’re here because of someone else’s screw-up.”

“How’s you know?” I asked surprised.

She shrugged. “Let’s just say you’re not the only one.” 

Behind me, Nico whispered, “Is she a ghost?”

Maya raised an eyebrow. “Who's that?”

“My brother. He’s eight. He’s gonna ask a million questions, so get ready.”

She smirked. “Bring it on. I’ve survived worse.”
I believed her.

Kiana was already climbing out of the car, dragging her own trash bag behind her, when she caught sight of me and Maya still talking.

“Ohhh,” she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, drawing out the sound with a stupid grin. “Roen’s already got a girlfriend in the woods.”

I rolled my eyes. “Shut up, Kiana.”

Maya snorted but didn’t say anything, just crossed her arms and waited like she was curious how this was gonna play out.

“I’m just saying,” she whispered, “you’ve known her for like two minutes and you’re already helping each other off the porch like it’s a rom-com.”

“You’re not even supposed to know what that is.”
“I’m twelve, not dumb.”

“She’s cute,” Kiana added, smirking now as she walked past. “Y’all gonna braid each other’s hair later?”

“I swear to god—”

“Language,” Mom chided from behind me. 

Before I could fire back, the front door creaked open again, and a woman stepped out. Thin, wiry frame. She wore a faded flannel and sweatpants like she’d stopped trying to impress anyone years ago. Her eyes darted across us—counting, maybe—and her smile didn’t quite reach all the way up.

“You must be the Mayumis,” she said. Her voice was raspy, probably from too many cigarettes or too many bad nights. Maybe both. “I’m Tasha. Tasha Foster.”

She stepped closer, and the smell hit me—sharp and bitter. Whiskey. 

Mom appeared behind us just in time. “Hi, I’m Marisol,” she said quietly, arms crossed like she already regretted every decision that led us here.

They hugged briefly. More of a press of shoulders than a real embrace. Tasha nodded toward the cabin. “We’re tight on space, but we cleared out the back room. Me, you, and the girls can take that. The boys can have the den.”

“Boys?” I asked, stepping into the doorway and immediately getting swarmed by noise.

Inside, it looked like someone tried to clean but gave up halfway through. There were dishes drying on one side of the sink, and unfolded laundry piled on the couch. A crusty pizza box sat on the counter next to an open bottle of something that definitely wasn’t juice.

Then came the thundering feet—three of them. First was a chubby kid with wild curls and a superhero shirt that was two sizes too small. He stopped, blinked at us, then just yelled, “New people!”

A girl around Kiana’s age followed, hair in tight braids and a glare that said she didn’t trust any of us. Behind her was a tall, lanky boy with headphones around his neck and that look teens get when they’re stuck somewhere they hate.

Maya rolled her eyes. “These are my siblings. That loud one’s Jay, the girl with the death stare is Bri, and the quiet one’s Malik.”

Jay darted toward Nico immediately, pointing at the PS4. “You got games?!”

Nico lit up. “A bunch.”

Mom and Tasha slipped into the kitchen to talk in low voices while the rest of us stood there in this weird moment of strangers under one roof. 

Maya looked around at the chaos. “So… welcome to the party.”

“Some party,” I muttered, but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth.

Kiana elbowed me. “I like it here,” she said.

—

Starting a new school in the middle of the year is trash. No one tells you where anything is, teachers already have favorites, and everybody’s locked into their little cliques like they’re afraid being friendly’s contagious.

Maya and I ended up in the same homeroom, which helped. It was the only part of the day that didn’t feel like I was walking into someone else’s house uninvited. She sat two rows over at first, headphones in, scribbling in the margins of a beat-up copy of The Bell Jar. I didn’t even know she read stuff like that.

We got paired up in Physics too—lab partners. I’m more of the “just tell me what to do and I’ll do it” type when it comes to school. I play ball. Football mostly, but I’m decent at track. Maya actually liked the subject. Asked questions. Took notes like they meant something. The first week, I thought we’d hate working together—like she’d think I was an idiot or something—but it wasn’t like that. She explained things without making it weird. 

She’d let me copy her answers—but only after I tried to understand them first.

At lunch, she sat outside under the trees near the side parking lot. Alone at first. I started joining her, ditching my usual spot with the guys.

I soon found out why she kept to herself. It started small. A few whispers behind cupped hands, little laughs when Maya walked past in the hallway. She didn’t react at first, just rolled her eyes and kept walking. But I saw the tightness in her jaw. The way her grip on her backpack straps got a little firmer.

Then one day, someone didn’t bother whispering.

The comments started behind her back—“Isn’t she the one with the crackhead mom?”, “Heard she’s got, like, four half-siblings. All different dads.” 

I felt Maya tense beside me. Not flinch—just go still, like something inside her snapped into place. She didn’t say anything. Didn’t even look at them. She just turned and walked fast, then faster, then she was running down the hall.

“Yo,” I called after her, but she was already gone.
I spun back to the group gossiping. 

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I snapped. Heads turned. Good. 

One of the guys laughed. “Relax, man. It’s just facts.”

“Facts?” I stepped closer. “You don’t know shit about her.”

The girl rolled her eyes. “She’s gonna end up just like her mom anyway. Everyone knows that.”

“Oh fuck off!” I shouted. I didn’t wait. I took off after Maya.

I checked the bathroom first. Empty. Then the quad. Nothing. My last period bell rang, but I didn’t care. I headed to the library because it was the only quiet place left in this school.

She was tucked into the far back corner, half-hidden behind the tall shelves nobody ever went to. Sitting on the floor. Knees pulled in. Hoodie sleeve pushed up.

My stomach dropped.

“Maya,” I said, low. Careful.

She didn’t look up.

I took a few slow steps closer and saw it—the razor in her hand. 

Her arm was a roadmap of old lines. Some faded. Some not.

“Hey,” I said, softer now. “Don’t.”

Her hand paused.

“You’re not allowed to say that,” she muttered. Her voice was wrecked. “You don’t get to stop me.”

“I know,” I said. “But I’m asking anyway.”

She laughed once, sharp and ugly. “They’re right, you know. About me. About all of it.”

I crouched down in front of her, keeping my hands where she could see them. “They don’t know you.”

“They know enough,” she said. “My mom’s an addict. She disappears for days. Sometimes weeks. We all got different dads. None of them stuck. People hear that and they already got my ending figured out.”

“You’re not,” I said.

She lifted the razor slightly. “You don’t know that.”

She finally looked at me. Her blue eyes were red, furious, tired. “You think I don’t see it? I’m already halfway there.”

I swallowed. “I know what it’s like when everyone assumes you’re trash because of who raised you.”
That got her attention.

“My dad’s been locked up most of my life,” I said. “I’ve got scars too.” I tapped my knuckles. Old marks. “From standing up to him when I shouldn’t have. From thinking I could fix things if I just tried harder.”
She stared at my hands like she was seeing them for the first time.

“I used to think if I didn’t fight back, I’d turn into him,” I went on. “Turns out, fighting him didn’t make me better either. Just made everything louder.”

Her grip on the razor loosened a little.

I reached out slowly. “Can you give me that?”

She hesitated. Long enough that my heart was pounding in my ears. Then she dropped the razor into my palm like it weighed a thousand pounds.

She covered her face and finally broke.

I stayed there. Didn’t try to fix it. Didn’t say the wrong hopeful crap. Just sat on the library floor with her while she cried it out.

—
​​That night, I knocked on Maya’s door after everyone had crashed.

“I have an idea,” I whispered. “It’s mean though…”
Maya smirked. “The meaner the better.”

That morning, we showed up to school early. We had backpacks full of supplies—a screwdriver, glitter, expired sardines, and four tiny tubes of industrial-strength superglue.

We snuck into the locker hallway when the janitor went for his smoke break. Maya kept lookout while I unscrewed the hinges on three locker doors—each one belonging to the worst of the trash-talkers. We laced the inside edges with glue, so when they slammed shut like usual, they’d stay that way. 

Inside one of them, we left a glitter bomb rigged to pop the second the door opened. In another, Maya stuffed the expired sardines into a pencil pouch and superglued that shut too. The smell would hit like a punch in the face.

We barely made it to homeroom before the chaos started.

First period: screaming from the hallway. Second period: a janitor with bolt cutters. By third period, the whole school was buzzing.

And then we got called to the office.

We got caught on cameras. Of course. We didn’t even try to lie. Just sat there while the vice principal read us the suspension notice like he was personally offended.

“Three days. Home. No extracurriculars. You’re lucky we’re not calling the police.”

Outside the office, Maya bumped my shoulder. “Worth it?”

I grinned. “Every second.”

—

I got my permit that November. Mom let me borrow the car sometimes, mostly because she was too tired to argue. We made it count—gas station dinners, thrift store photo shoots, late-night drives to nowhere.

We’d sneak out some nights just to lie in the truck bed and stare at the stars through the trees, counting satellites and pretending they were escape pods.

The first time she kissed me, it wasn’t planned. We were sitting in the school parking lot, waiting for the rain to let up. She just looked over and said, “I’m gonna do something stupid,” then leaned in before I could ask what. After that, it all moved fast.

The first time we had sex was in the back of the car, parked on an old forestry road, all fumbling hands and held breath. We thought we were careful.

The scare happened two weeks later. A late period, a pregnancy test from the pharmacy. The longest three minutes of our lives, standing in that cabin’s moldy bathroom, waiting. When it was negative, we didn’t celebrate. She laughed. I almost cried.

After that, we thought more about the future. Maya started talking about college more. Somewhere far. I didn’t have plans like that, but I was working weekends at the pizza shop, and started saving. Not for clothes or games—just for getting out. 

—

By December, things settled down a bit. We tried to make the best of the holidays. All month, the cabin smelled like pine and mildew and cheap cinnamon candles. We’d managed to scrape together some decorations—paper snowflakes, a string of busted lights that only half worked, and a sad fake tree we found at the thrift store for five bucks. Nico hung plastic ornaments like it was the real deal. Kiana made hot cocoa from a dollar store mix and forced everyone to drink it. Mom even smiled a few times, though it never lasted.

Maya and I did our part. Helped the little kids wrap presents in newspaper. Made jokes about how Santa probably skipped our cabin because the GPS gave up halfway up the mountain. 

Even Tasha seemed mellow for once.

But then Christmas Eve hit. 

Maya’s mom announced that afternoon she was inviting her new boyfriend over for dinner. Some dude named Rick or Rich or something. Maya went quiet first, then full-on exploded.

“You’re kidding, right?” she snapped. “You’re really bringing some random guy here? On Christmas Eve?”

Tasha shrugged like it was no big deal. “He’s not random. I’ve known him for months.”

“And that makes it fucking okay? And now we’re supposed to play happy family?”

“Watch your mouth.”

“Or what? You’ll vanish for a week and pretend this never happened?”

Tasha lit a cigarette inside the house, which she only did when she was mad. “It’s my house, Maya. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”

Maya laughed. “Gladly.”

She grabbed her bag and was out the door before I could say anything. I followed.

We sat on the steps while the cold settled into our bones. She didn’t talk. Just stared out at the trees, fists clenched in her lap like she was holding herself together by force. I leaned over, bumped her shoulder.

“Let’s bounce.”

She looked at me. “Where?""

“Anywhere but here.”

So we sneaked out. I borrowed Mom’s car.

We drove up to a dirt road, way up past the ranger station, where the trees cleared and gave you this wide, unreal view of the valley below. You could see for miles.

I popped the trunk, and we sat with our legs hanging out the back, wrapped in a blanket. I pulled out the six-pack I’d stashed—some knockoff lager from that corner store near school that never asked questions. Maya lit a joint she’d swiped from her mom’s stash and passed it to me without saying anything.

We just sat there, knees touching, sipping beer and smoking the joint, watching our breath cloud up in the freezing air. Maya played music off her phone, low. Some old indie Christmas playlist she’d downloaded for the irony.

At one point, she leaned her head on my shoulder.

“Thanks,” she whispered.

“For what?”

“For giving me something that doesn’t suck.”

—

Maya was humming some half-forgotten carol when I noticed it—this streak of light cutting across the night sky, low and fast. At first I thought it was just a shooting star, but it didn’t fizzle out like it was supposed to. It curved. Like it was changing direction. Like it knew where it was going.

“Did you see that?” I asked.

She lifted her head. “What?”

I pointed. “That...”

Maya squinted. “What am I supposed to be looking at?”
I fumbled the binoculars from the glovebox—old ones my uncle gave me for spotting deer. I raised them to my eyes.

I held them up so that Maya could see too, adjusted the focus, and froze.

Maya noticed right away. “What? What is it?”

Through the binoculars, there were figures—too many to count, all of them fast. Not like planes. More like shadows ripping across the sky, riding... something. Horses, maybe. Or things shaped like horses but wrong. Twisted. And riders—tall, thin figures wrapped in cloaks that whipped in the wind, some with skull faces, some with no faces at all. Weapons glinted in their hands. Swords. Spears. Chains.

“Oh. No,” Maya whispered. 

“What is it?” I asked.

She looked at me. “It’s heading towards the cabin.”

I snatched the binoculars back, my hands shaking so hard the image blurred. It took me three tries to steady them against my face.

She was right.

The things weren’t just in the sky anymore. They were descending, a dark wave pouring down the tree line toward the base of the mountain. Toward our road. Toward the cabin.

“We have to go. Now.” 

We scrambled into the car. I spun the tires in the dirt, wrenching the wheel toward home. The headlights carved a shaky path through the dark as we flew down the mountain road, branches slapping the windshield.
“Call my mom,” I told Maya, handing my phone to her. 
“Put it on speaker.”
The ringing seemed to last forever. Mom picked up.

“Roen? Where are you? Where’s the car?” The anger was a live wire.

“Mom, listen! You have to get everyone inside. Lock the doors. Right now.”

“What are you talking about? Are you in trouble?”

“Mom, no! Listen! There’s something coming. From the sky. We saw it. It’s coming down the mountain toward the cabin.”

A beat of dead silence. Then her tone, cold and disbelieving. “Have you been doing drugs? Is Maya with you?”

“Mom, I swear to God, I’m… Please, just look outside. Go to a window and look up toward the ridge.”

“I’m looking, Roen. I don’t see anything but trees and…” She trailed off. I heard a faint, distant sound through the phone, like bells, but twisted and metallic. “What is that noise?”

Then, Nico’s voice, excited in the background. “Mom! Mom! Look! It’s Santa’s sleigh! I see the lights!”

Kiana joined in. “Whoa! Are those reindeer?”

“Kids, get back from the window,” Mom said, but her voice had changed. The anger was gone, replaced by a slow-dawning confusion. The bells were louder now, mixed with a sound like wind tearing through a canyon.

“Mom, it’s NOT Santa!” I was yelling, my foot pressing the accelerator to the floor. The car fishtailed on a gravel curve. “Get everyone and run into the woods! Now!”

The line went quiet for one second too long. Not dead quiet—I could hear the muffled rustle of the phone in my mom’s hand, a sharp intake of breath.

Then the sounds started.

Not bells anymore. Something lower, a grinding hum that vibrated through the phone speaker. It was followed by a skittering, scraping noise, like claws on slate, getting closer. Fast.

“Marisol?” Tasha’s voice, distant and confused. “Is something on the roof?”

A thud shook the line, so heavy it made my mom gasp. Then a shriek—not human, something high and chittering.

A window shattered. A massive, bursting crunch, like something had come straight through the wall.

Then the screams started.

Not just screams of fear. These were sounds of pure, physical terror. Kiana’s high-pitched shriek cut off into a gurgle. Nico wailed, “Mommy!” before his voice was swallowed by a thick, wet thud and a crash of furniture.

“NO! GET AWAY FROM THEM!” My mom’s voice was raw, a warrior’s cry. I heard a grunt of effort, the smash of something heavy—maybe a lamp, a chair—connecting, followed by a hiss that was absolutely not human.

Tasha was cursing, a stream of furious, slurred shouts. There was a scuffle, then a body hitting the floor.

“ROEN!” My mom screamed my name into the phone. It was the last clear word.

A final, piercing shriek was cut short. Then a heavy, dragging sound. 

The line hissed with empty static for three heartbeats.

Then it went dead.

The car tore around the last bend. The cabin came into view, every window blazing with light. The front door was gone. Just a dark, open hole.

I slammed on the brakes, the car skidding to a stop fifty yards away.

The car was still ticking when I killed the engine. 
Maya grabbed my arm. “Roen. Don’t.”

I pulled free. My legs felt numb, like they didn’t belong to me anymore, but they still moved. Every step toward the house felt wrong, like I was walking into a memory that hadn’t happened yet.

The ground between us and the cabin was torn up—deep gouges in the dirt, snapped branches, something dragged straight through the yard. The porch was half gone. The roof sagged in the middle like it had been stepped on.

We desperately called our family’s names. But some part of me already knew no one would answer.
The inside smelled wrong. Something metallic and burnt.

The living room barely looked like a room anymore. Furniture smashed flat. Walls cracked. Blood everywhere—smeared, sprayed, soaked into the carpet so dark it almost looked black. Bodies were scattered where people had been standing or running.

Jay was closest to the door. Or what was left of him. His body lay twisted at an angle that didn’t make sense, like he’d been thrown. 

Bri was near the hallway. She was facedown, drowned in her own blood. One arm stretched out like she’d been reaching for someone. Malik was farther back, slumped against the wall, eyes open but empty, throat cut clean. 

Tasha was near the kitchen. Or what was left of her. Her torso was slashed open, ribs visible through torn fabric. Her head was missing. One hand was clenched around a broken bottle, like she’d tried to fight back even when it was already over.

Maya dropped to her knees.

“No, mommy, no…” she said. Over and over. 

I kept moving because if I stopped, I wasn’t sure I’d start again.

My hands were shaking so bad I had to press them into my jeans to steady myself.

“Mom,” I called out, even though I already knew.

The back room was crushed inward like something heavy had landed there.

Mom was on the floor. I knew it was her because she was curled around a smaller body.

Kiana was inside her arms, turned into my mom’s chest. Her head was gone. Just a ragged stump at her neck, soaked dark. My mom’s face was frozen mid-scream, eyes wide, mouth open, teeth bared.

I couldn’t breathe. My chest locked up, and for a second I thought I might pass out standing there.
I dropped to my knees anyway.

“I’m sorry,” I said. To both of them. To all of them. Like it might still matter.

Then, something moved.

Not the house settling. Not the wind. This was close. Wet. Fast.

I snapped my head toward the hallway and backed up on instinct, almost slipping in blood. My heart was hammering so hard it felt like it was shaking my teeth loose.

“Maya,” I said, low and sharp. “Get up. Something’s still here.”

She sucked in a breath like she’d been punched and scrambled to her feet, eyes wild. I looked around for anything that wasn’t broken or nailed down.

That’s when I saw my mom’s hand.

Tucked against her wrist, half-hidden by her sleeve, was a revolver. The snub‑nose she kept buried in the back of the closet “just in case.” I’d seen it once, years ago, when she thought my dad was coming back drunk and angry.

I knelt and pried it free, gently, like she might still feel it.

The gun was warm.

I flipped the cylinder open with shaking fingers. Five loaded chambers. One spent casing.

“She got a shot off,” I whispered. 

Maya was already moving. She grabbed a bat leaning against the wall near the tree—aluminum, cheap, still wrapped with a torn bow. Jay’s Christmas present. She peeled the plastic off and took a stance like she’d done this before.

The thing scuttled out of the hallway on all fours, moving with a broken, jerky grace. It was all wrong—a patchwork of fur and leathery skin, twisted horns, and eyes that burned like wet matches. It was big, shoulders hunched low to clear the ceiling. And on its flank, a raw, blackened crater wept thick, tar-like blood. My mom’s shot.

Our eyes met. Its jaws unhinged with a sound like cracking ice.

It charged.

I didn’t think. I raised the revolver and pulled the trigger. The first blast was deafening in the shattered room. It hit the thing in the chest, barely slowing it. I fired again. And again. The shots were too fast, my aim wild. I saw chunks of it jerk away. One shot took a piece of its ear. Another sparked off a horn.
It was on me.

The smell hit—old blood and wet earth. A claw swiped, ripping my jacket.

That’s when the bat connected.

Maya swung from the side with everything she had. The aluminum thwanged against its knee. Something cracked. The creature buckled. She swung again, a two-handed blow to its ribs. Another sickening crunch.

The creature turned on her, giving me its side. I jammed the barrel of the pistol into its ribcase and fired the last round point-blank. The thing let out a shriek of pure agony.

The creature reeled back, a spray of dark fluid gushing from the new hole in its side. It hissed, legs buckling beneath it. It took a step forward and collapsed hard, one hand clawing at the floor like it still wanted to fight. 

I stood there with the revolver hanging useless in my hand, ears ringing, lungs barely working. My jacket, my hands, my face—everything was slick with its blood. Thick, black, warm. It dripped off my fingers and splattered onto the wrecked floor like oil.

I couldn’t move. My brain felt unplugged. Like if I stayed perfectly still, none of this would be real.

“Roen.” Maya’s voice sounded far away. Then closer. “Roen—look at me.”

I didn’t.

She grabbed my wrists hard. Her hands were shaking worse than mine. “Hey. Hey. We have to go. Right now.”

I blinked. My eyes burned. “My mom… Kiana…”

“I know, babe,” she said, voice cracking but steady anyway. “But we can’t stay here.”

Something deep in me fought that. Screamed at me to stay. To do something. To not leave them like this. 

Maya tugged me toward the door. I let her.

We stumbled out into the cold night, slipping in the torn-up dirt. The air hit my face and I sucked it in like I’d been underwater too long. The sky above the cabin was alive.

Shapes moved across it—dark figures lifting off from the ground, rising in spirals and lines, mounting beasts that shouldn’t exist. Antlers. Wings. Too many legs. Too many eyes. The sound came back, clearer now: bells, laughter, howling wind.

They rose over the treeline in a long, crooked procession, silhouettes cutting across the moon. And at the front of it—
I stopped dead.

The sleigh floated higher than the rest, massive and ornate, pulled by creatures that looked like reindeer only in the loosest sense. Their bodies were stretched wrong, ribs showing through skin, eyes glowing like coals.

At the reins stood him.

Tall. Broad. Wrapped in red that looked stained in blood. His beard hung in clumps, matted and dark. His smile was too wide, teeth too many. A crown of antlers rose from his head, tangled with bells that rang wrong—deep, warped.

He reached down into the sleigh, grabbed something that kicked and screamed, and hauled it up by the arm.

Nico.

My brother thrashed, crying, his small hands clawing at the edge of the sleigh. I saw his face clearly in the firelight—terror, confusion, mouth open as he screamed my name.

“NO!” I tried to run. Maya wrapped her arms around my chest and hauled me back with everything she had.

The figure laughed. A deep, booming sound that echoed through the trees and into my bones. He shoved Nico headfirst into a bulging sack already writhing with movement—other kids, other screams—then tied it shut like it was nothing.

The sleigh lurched forward.The procession surged after it, riders whooping and shrieking as they climbed into the sky. 

Something dragged itself out of the cabin behind us.

The wounded creature. The one we thought was dead.

It staggered on three limbs, leaving a thick trail of blood across the porch and into the dirt. It let out a broken, furious cry and launched itself forward as the sleigh passed overhead.

Its claws caught the back rail of the sleigh. It slammed into the side hard, dangling there, legs kicking uselessly as the procession carried it upward. Blood sprayed out behind it in a long, dark arc, raining down through the trees.

For a few seconds, it hung on. Dragged. Refused to let go.
Then its grip failed.

The creature fell.

It vanished into the forest below with a distant, wet crash that echoed once and then went silent.

The sleigh didn’t slow.

The Santa thing threw his head back and laughed again, louder this time, like the sound itself was a victory. Then the hunt disappeared into the clouds, the bells fading until there was nothing left but wind and ruined trees and the broken shell of the cabin behind us.

—

We just sat down in the dirt a few yards from the cabin and held onto each other like if we let go, one of us would disappear too.

I don’t know how long it was. Long enough for the cold to stop mattering. Long enough for my hands to go numb around Maya’s jacket. Long enough for my brain to start doing this stupid thing where it kept trying to rewind, like maybe I’d missed a moment where I could’ve done something different.

It was Maya who finally remembered the phone.

“Roen,” she said, voice hoarse. “We have to call the police….”

My hands shook so bad I dropped my phone twice before I managed to unlock the screen. There was dried blood in the cracks of the case. I dialed 911 and put it on speaker because I didn’t trust myself to hold it.

The dispatcher’s voice was calm. Too calm.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

—

The cops showed up fast. Faster than I expected. Two cruisers at first, then more. Red and blue lights flooded the trees like some messed-up holiday display.

They separated us immediately.

Hands up. On your knees. Don’t move.

I remember one of them staring at my jacket, at the black blood smeared down my arms, and his hand never left his gun.

They asked us what happened. Over and over. Separately. Same questions, different words.

I told them there were things in the house. I told them they killed everyone. I told them they weren't human.

That was the exact moment their faces changed.

Not fear. Not concern.

Suspicion.

They cuffed my hands. Maya’s too. 

At first, they tried to pin it on me. Or maybe both of us. Kept pressing like we were hiding something, like maybe there was a fight that got out of hand, or we snapped, or it was drugs. Asked where I dumped Nico’s body.

One of the detectives took the revolver out of an evidence bag and set it on the table of the interrogation room like it was a point he’d been waiting to make.

“So you fired this?”

“Yes,” I said. “At the thing.”

“What thing?”

I looked at him. “The thing that killed my family.”

He wrote something down and nodded like that explained everything.

When the forensics team finally showed up and started putting the scene together, it got harder to make it stick. The blood patterns, the way the bodies were torn apart—none of it made sense for a standard attack. Way too violent. Way too messy. Too many injuries that didn’t line up with the weapons they found. No human did that. No animal either, far as they could tell. But they sure as hell weren’t going to write “mythical sky monsters” in the report.

Next theory? My dad.

But he was still locked up. Solid alibi. The detectives even visited him in prison to personally make sure he was still there. 
After that, they looked at Rick. Tasha’s boyfriend. Only problem? They found him too. What was left of him, anyway. His body was found near the front yard, slumped against a tree. Neck snapped like a twig.

That’s when they got quiet. No more hard questions. Just forms. Statements. A counselor.

We were minors. No surviving family. That part was simple.
Child Protect Services got involved.

They wanted to split us up. Said it was temporary, just until they could sort everything out. I got assigned a group home in Clovis. Maya got somewhere in Madera.

—

The day they told me I was getting moved, I didn’t even argue. There wasn’t any fight left. Just this empty numbness that settled behind my ribs and stayed there. The caseworker—Janine or Jenna or something—told me the social worker wanted to talk before the transfer. I figured it was some last-minute paperwork thing.

Instead, they walked me into this windowless office and shut the door behind me.

Maya was already there.

She looked as rough as I felt—pale, shadows under her baby-blue eyes. When she saw me, she blinked like she wasn’t sure I was real. We just stood there for a second.

Then she crossed the room and hugged me so hard it hurt.
I held on. Didn’t say anything. Couldn’t.

“Hey,” she said into my shoulder. Her voice shook once. “Hey,” I replied.

“I thought they sent you away already,” I said.

“Almost,” she said. “Guess we got a delay.”

We pulled apart when someone cleared their throat.

I looked up to see a woman already in the room, standing near the wall.

She was in her late thirties, maybe. She didn’t look like a social worker I’d ever seen. Didn’t smell like stale coffee or exhaustion. Black blazer and jeans. Her dark brown hair was cropped short and neat. Her hazel eyes were sharp, measuring, like she was sizing up threats.

She closed the door behind her.

“I’m glad you two got a moment to catch up,” she said calmly. “Please, sit.”

“My name is Agent Sara Benoit,” she said.

The woman waited until we were seated before she spoke again. She didn’t rush it. Let the silence stretch just long enough to feel intentional.

“I know you’ve already talked to the police,” she said. “Multiple times.”

I let out a short, tired laugh. “Then why are we here again?”
She looked at me directly. Not through me. Not like I was a problem to solve. “Because I’m not with the police.”

Maya stiffened beside me. I felt it through her sleeve.

I said, “So what? You’re a shrink? This is where you tell us we’re crazy, right?”

Benoit shook her head. “No. This is where I tell you I believe you.”

That landed heavier than any I’d heard so far.

I stared at her. “You… what?”

“I believe there was something non-human involved in the killings at that cabin,” she said. Flat. Like she was reading off a weather report. “I believe what you saw in the sky was real. And I believe the entity you described—what the media will eventually call an animal or a cult or a psychotic break—is none of those things.”

The room was quiet except for the hum of the lights.

Maya spoke up. “They said we were traumatized. That our minds filled in the gaps.”

Benoit nodded. “That’s what they have to say. It keeps things neat.”

That pissed me off more than anything else she could’ve said.

“Neat? I saw my family slaughtered,” I said. My voice stayed level, but it took work. “I watched something dressed like evil Santa kidnap my brother . If you’re about to tell me to move on, don’t.”

Benoit didn’t flinch.

“I’m not here to tell you that,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that what took your brother isn’t untouchable. And what killed your family doesn’t get to walk away clean.”

My chest tightened. Maya’s fingers found mine under the table and locked on.

I shook my head. “The fuck can you do about it? What are you? FBI? CIA? Some Men in Black knockoff with worse suits?”

She smirked at my jab, then reached into her blazer slowly, deliberately, like she didn’t want us to think she was pulling a weapon. She flipped open a leather badge wallet and slid it across the table.

‘NORAD
 Special Investigations Division’

The seal was real. The badge was heavy. Government ugly. No flair.

“…NORAD?” I said. “What’s that?”

“North American Aerospace Defense Command,” she explained. “Officially, we track airspace. Missiles. Unidentified aircraft. Anything that crosses borders where it shouldn’t.”

“What the hell does fucking NORAD want with us?” I demanded.

Benoit didn’t flinch. She just stated, “I’m here to offer you a choice.”

“A choice?” Maya asked.

She nodded. “Option one: you go to group homes, therapy, court dates. You try to live with what you saw. The official story will be ‘unknown assailants’ and ‘tragic circumstances.’ Your brother will be listed as deceased once the paperwork catches up.”

My chest burned. “And the other option?”

“Option two,” she said, her voice low and steady, “you come with me. You disappear on paper. New names, new files. You train with us. You learn what these things are, and how to kill them.

I'm Going to Get Him Back (Part 1),"When dad got locked up again, it didn’t hit right away. He’d been in and out since I was nine, but this time felt different. Longer sentence. Something about assault with a weapon and parole violations. My mom, Marisol, cried once, then shut down completely. No yelling, no last minute plea to judge for leniency—just silence.

“He’s going away for at least fifteen years.”

It wasn’t news. We all knew. I’d heard her crying about it on the phone to my grandma in the Philippines through the paper-thin wall. My little sister, Kiana heard it too but didn’t say anything. Just curled up on the mattress with his headphones on, pretending she couldn’t. 

Then mom couldn’t make rent. The landlord came by with that fake sympathy, like he felt bad but not bad enough to wait one more week for rent before evicting us. 

Our house in Fresno was one of those old stucco duplexes with mold in the vents and a broken front fence. Still, it was home. 

“We’ll get a fresh start,” Mom said.

And by “fresh start,” she meant a cabin in the Sierra Nevada that looked cheap even in blurry online photos. The only reason it was so affordable was because another family—who was somehow even worse off than we were—was willing to split the cost. We’d “make it work.” Whatever that meant.

I packed my clothes in trash bags. My baby brother, Nico, clutched his PS4 the whole time like someone was gonna steal it. Mom sold the washer and our living room couch for gas money.

When we finally pulled up, the place wasn’t a cabin so much as a box with windows. The woods pressed tight around it like the trees wanted to swallow it whole.

“Looks haunted,” I muttered, stepping out of the car and staring at the place. It had a sagging roof, moss creeping up one side, and a screen door that hung off one hinge like it gave up trying years ago.

Nico’s face scrunched up. “Haunted? For real?”

I shrugged. “Guess we’ll find out tonight.”

“We will?” He whispers.

Mom shot me that look. “Seriously, Roen?” she snapped. “You think this is funny? No, baby, it’s not haunted.” She reassured Nico.

I swung one of the trash bags over my shoulder and headed for the front door. The steps creaked loud under my feet, like even they weren’t sure they could hold me. Just as I reached for the knob—
I heard voices. Two people inside, arguing loud enough that I didn’t need to strain to catch it.

“I’m not sharing a room with some random people, Mom!” Said a girl’s voice. 

A second voice fired back, older, calmer but tight with frustration. “Maya, we’ve been over this. We don’t have a choice.”

Then I heard footsteps—fast ones, heavy and pissed off, thudding through the cabin toward the door.

Before I could move out of the way or even say anything, the front door flung open hard—right into me. The edge caught me square in the shoulder and chest, knocking the air out of me as I stumbled backward and landed flat on the porch with a loud thump.

“Shit,” I muttered, wincing.

A shadow filled the doorway. I looked up and there she was—the girl, standing over me with wide eyes and a face full of panic.

“Oh my god—I didn’t see you,” she said, breathless. “Are you okay? I didn’t—God, I’m sorry.”

She knelt down a little, hand halfway out like she wasn’t sure if she should help me up or if she’d already done enough damage.

I sat up, rubbing my ribs and trying not to look like it actually hurt as bad as it did. “Yeah,” I grunted. “I mean, it’s just a screen door. Not like it was made of steel or anything.”

I grabbed her outstretched hand. Her grip was stronger than I expected, but her fingers trembled a little.

She looked about my age—sixteen, maybe seventeen—with this messy blonde braid half falling apart and a hoodie that looked like it had been through a few too many wash cycles. Her nails were painted black, chipped down to the corners. She didn’t let go of my hand right away.

Her face changed fast. Like something hot in her just shut off the second our eyes locked. The sharp edge drained out of her expression, like she forgot what she was mad about.

“I didn’t know anyone was standing out here,” she said again, softer this time. “I just... needed air.”

“It’s all good,” I said, brushing dirt off my jeans and trying to gather my spilled stuff. “Not my first time getting knocked down today.”

She glanced awkwardly back inside. “So... guess that means you’re the people we’re sharing this dump with?”

“Yup. The other half of the broke brigade.”

She held out her hand. “I’m Maya.”

I took it. “Roen.”

“Let me guess…say you’re here because of someone else’s screw-up.”

“How’s you know?” I asked surprised.

She shrugged. “Let’s just say you’re not the only one.” 

Behind me, Nico whispered, “Is she a ghost?”

Maya raised an eyebrow. “Who's that?”

“My brother. He’s eight. He’s gonna ask a million questions, so get ready.”

She smirked. “Bring it on. I’ve survived worse.”
I believed her.

Kiana was already climbing out of the car, dragging her own trash bag behind her, when she caught sight of me and Maya still talking.

“Ohhh,” she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, drawing out the sound with a stupid grin. “Roen’s already got a girlfriend in the woods.”

I rolled my eyes. “Shut up, Kiana.”

Maya snorted but didn’t say anything, just crossed her arms and waited like she was curious how this was gonna play out.

“I’m just saying,” she whispered, “you’ve known her for like two minutes and you’re already helping each other off the porch like it’s a rom-com.”

“You’re not even supposed to know what that is.”
“I’m twelve, not dumb.”

“She’s cute,” Kiana added, smirking now as she walked past. “Y’all gonna braid each other’s hair later?”

“I swear to god—”

“Language,” Mom chided from behind me. 

Before I could fire back, the front door creaked open again, and a woman stepped out. Thin, wiry frame. She wore a faded flannel and sweatpants like she’d stopped trying to impress anyone years ago. Her eyes darted across us—counting, maybe—and her smile didn’t quite reach all the way up.

“You must be the Mayumis,” she said. Her voice was raspy, probably from too many cigarettes or too many bad nights. Maybe both. “I’m Tasha. Tasha Foster.”

She stepped closer, and the smell hit me—sharp and bitter. Whiskey. 

Mom appeared behind us just in time. “Hi, I’m Marisol,” she said quietly, arms crossed like she already regretted every decision that led us here.

They hugged briefly. More of a press of shoulders than a real embrace. Tasha nodded toward the cabin. “We’re tight on space, but we cleared out the back room. Me, you, and the girls can take that. The boys can have the den.”

“Boys?” I asked, stepping into the doorway and immediately getting swarmed by noise.

Inside, it looked like someone tried to clean but gave up halfway through. There were dishes drying on one side of the sink, and unfolded laundry piled on the couch. A crusty pizza box sat on the counter next to an open bottle of something that definitely wasn’t juice.

Then came the thundering feet—three of them. First was a chubby kid with wild curls and a superhero shirt that was two sizes too small. He stopped, blinked at us, then just yelled, “New people!”

A girl around Kiana’s age followed, hair in tight braids and a glare that said she didn’t trust any of us. Behind her was a tall, lanky boy with headphones around his neck and that look teens get when they’re stuck somewhere they hate.

Maya rolled her eyes. “These are my siblings. That loud one’s Jay, the girl with the death stare is Bri, and the quiet one’s Malik.”

Jay darted toward Nico immediately, pointing at the PS4. “You got games?!”

Nico lit up. “A bunch.”

Mom and Tasha slipped into the kitchen to talk in low voices while the rest of us stood there in this weird moment of strangers under one roof. 

Maya looked around at the chaos. “So… welcome to the party.”

“Some party,” I muttered, but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth.

Kiana elbowed me. “I like it here,” she said.

—

Starting a new school in the middle of the year is trash. No one tells you where anything is, teachers already have favorites, and everybody’s locked into their little cliques like they’re afraid being friendly’s contagious.

Maya and I ended up in the same homeroom, which helped. It was the only part of the day that didn’t feel like I was walking into someone else’s house uninvited. She sat two rows over at first, headphones in, scribbling in the margins of a beat-up copy of The Bell Jar. I didn’t even know she read stuff like that.

We got paired up in Physics too—lab partners. I’m more of the “just tell me what to do and I’ll do it” type when it comes to school. I play ball. Football mostly, but I’m decent at track. Maya actually liked the subject. Asked questions. Took notes like they meant something. The first week, I thought we’d hate working together—like she’d think I was an idiot or something—but it wasn’t like that. She explained things without making it weird. 

She’d let me copy her answers—but only after I tried to understand them first.

At lunch, she sat outside under the trees near the side parking lot. Alone at first. I started joining her, ditching my usual spot with the guys.

I soon found out why she kept to herself. It started small. A few whispers behind cupped hands, little laughs when Maya walked past in the hallway. She didn’t react at first, just rolled her eyes and kept walking. But I saw the tightness in her jaw. The way her grip on her backpack straps got a little firmer.

Then one day, someone didn’t bother whispering.

The comments started behind her back—“Isn’t she the one with the crackhead mom?”, “Heard she’s got, like, four half-siblings. All different dads.” 

I felt Maya tense beside me. Not flinch—just go still, like something inside her snapped into place. She didn’t say anything. Didn’t even look at them. She just turned and walked fast, then faster, then she was running down the hall.

“Yo,” I called after her, but she was already gone.
I spun back to the group gossiping. 

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I snapped. Heads turned. Good. 

One of the guys laughed. “Relax, man. It’s just facts.”

“Facts?” I stepped closer. “You don’t know shit about her.”

The girl rolled her eyes. “She’s gonna end up just like her mom anyway. Everyone knows that.”

“Oh fuck off!” I shouted. I didn’t wait. I took off after Maya.

I checked the bathroom first. Empty. Then the quad. Nothing. My last period bell rang, but I didn’t care. I headed to the library because it was the only quiet place left in this school.

She was tucked into the far back corner, half-hidden behind the tall shelves nobody ever went to. Sitting on the floor. Knees pulled in. Hoodie sleeve pushed up.

My stomach dropped.

“Maya,” I said, low. Careful.

She didn’t look up.

I took a few slow steps closer and saw it—the razor in her hand. 

Her arm was a roadmap of old lines. Some faded. Some not.

“Hey,” I said, softer now. “Don’t.”

Her hand paused.

“You’re not allowed to say that,” she muttered. Her voice was wrecked. “You don’t get to stop me.”

“I know,” I said. “But I’m asking anyway.”

She laughed once, sharp and ugly. “They’re right, you know. About me. About all of it.”

I crouched down in front of her, keeping my hands where she could see them. “They don’t know you.”

“They know enough,” she said. “My mom’s an addict. She disappears for days. Sometimes weeks. We all got different dads. None of them stuck. People hear that and they already got my ending figured out.”

“You’re not,” I said.

She lifted the razor slightly. “You don’t know that.”

She finally looked at me. Her blue eyes were red, furious, tired. “You think I don’t see it? I’m already halfway there.”

I swallowed. “I know what it’s like when everyone assumes you’re trash because of who raised you.”
That got her attention.

“My dad’s been locked up most of my life,” I said. “I’ve got scars too.” I tapped my knuckles. Old marks. “From standing up to him when I shouldn’t have. From thinking I could fix things if I just tried harder.”
She stared at my hands like she was seeing them for the first time.

“I used to think if I didn’t fight back, I’d turn into him,” I went on. “Turns out, fighting him didn’t make me better either. Just made everything louder.”

Her grip on the razor loosened a little.

I reached out slowly. “Can you give me that?”

She hesitated. Long enough that my heart was pounding in my ears. Then she dropped the razor into my palm like it weighed a thousand pounds.

She covered her face and finally broke.

I stayed there. Didn’t try to fix it. Didn’t say the wrong hopeful crap. Just sat on the library floor with her while she cried it out.

—
​​That night, I knocked on Maya’s door after everyone had crashed.

“I have an idea,” I whispered. “It’s mean though…”
Maya smirked. “The meaner the better.”

That morning, we showed up to school early. We had backpacks full of supplies—a screwdriver, glitter, expired sardines, and four tiny tubes of industrial-strength superglue.

We snuck into the locker hallway when the janitor went for his smoke break. Maya kept lookout while I unscrewed the hinges on three locker doors—each one belonging to the worst of the trash-talkers. We laced the inside edges with glue, so when they slammed shut like usual, they’d stay that way. 

Inside one of them, we left a glitter bomb rigged to pop the second the door opened. In another, Maya stuffed the expired sardines into a pencil pouch and superglued that shut too. The smell would hit like a punch in the face.

We barely made it to homeroom before the chaos started.

First period: screaming from the hallway. Second period: a janitor with bolt cutters. By third period, the whole school was buzzing.

And then we got called to the office.

We got caught on cameras. Of course. We didn’t even try to lie. Just sat there while the vice principal read us the suspension notice like he was personally offended.

“Three days. Home. No extracurriculars. You’re lucky we’re not calling the police.”

Outside the office, Maya bumped my shoulder. “Worth it?”

I grinned. “Every second.”

—

I got my permit that November. Mom let me borrow the car sometimes, mostly because she was too tired to argue. We made it count—gas station dinners, thrift store photo shoots, late-night drives to nowhere.

We’d sneak out some nights just to lie in the truck bed and stare at the stars through the trees, counting satellites and pretending they were escape pods.

The first time she kissed me, it wasn’t planned. We were sitting in the school parking lot, waiting for the rain to let up. She just looked over and said, “I’m gonna do something stupid,” then leaned in before I could ask what. After that, it all moved fast.

The first time we had sex was in the back of the car, parked on an old forestry road, all fumbling hands and held breath. We thought we were careful.

The scare happened two weeks later. A late period, a pregnancy test from the pharmacy. The longest three minutes of our lives, standing in that cabin’s moldy bathroom, waiting. When it was negative, we didn’t celebrate. She laughed. I almost cried.

After that, we thought more about the future. Maya started talking about college more. Somewhere far. I didn’t have plans like that, but I was working weekends at the pizza shop, and started saving. Not for clothes or games—just for getting out. 

—

By December, things settled down a bit. We tried to make the best of the holidays. All month, the cabin smelled like pine and mildew and cheap cinnamon candles. We’d managed to scrape together some decorations—paper snowflakes, a string of busted lights that only half worked, and a sad fake tree we found at the thrift store for five bucks. Nico hung plastic ornaments like it was the real deal. Kiana made hot cocoa from a dollar store mix and forced everyone to drink it. Mom even smiled a few times, though it never lasted.

Maya and I did our part. Helped the little kids wrap presents in newspaper. Made jokes about how Santa probably skipped our cabin because the GPS gave up halfway up the mountain. 

Even Tasha seemed mellow for once.

But then Christmas Eve hit. 

Maya’s mom announced that afternoon she was inviting her new boyfriend over for dinner. Some dude named Rick or Rich or something. Maya went quiet first, then full-on exploded.

“You’re kidding, right?” she snapped. “You’re really bringing some random guy here? On Christmas Eve?”

Tasha shrugged like it was no big deal. “He’s not random. I’ve known him for months.”

“And that makes it fucking okay? And now we’re supposed to play happy family?”

“Watch your mouth.”

“Or what? You’ll vanish for a week and pretend this never happened?”

Tasha lit a cigarette inside the house, which she only did when she was mad. “It’s my house, Maya. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”

Maya laughed. “Gladly.”

She grabbed her bag and was out the door before I could say anything. I followed.

We sat on the steps while the cold settled into our bones. She didn’t talk. Just stared out at the trees, fists clenched in her lap like she was holding herself together by force. I leaned over, bumped her shoulder.

“Let’s bounce.”

She looked at me. “Where?""

“Anywhere but here.”

So we sneaked out. I borrowed Mom’s car.

We drove up to a dirt road, way up past the ranger station, where the trees cleared and gave you this wide, unreal view of the valley below. You could see for miles.

I popped the trunk, and we sat with our legs hanging out the back, wrapped in a blanket. I pulled out the six-pack I’d stashed—some knockoff lager from that corner store near school that never asked questions. Maya lit a joint she’d swiped from her mom’s stash and passed it to me without saying anything.

We just sat there, knees touching, sipping beer and smoking the joint, watching our breath cloud up in the freezing air. Maya played music off her phone, low. Some old indie Christmas playlist she’d downloaded for the irony.

At one point, she leaned her head on my shoulder.

“Thanks,” she whispered.

“For what?”

“For giving me something that doesn’t suck.”

—

Maya was humming some half-forgotten carol when I noticed it—this streak of light cutting across the night sky, low and fast. At first I thought it was just a shooting star, but it didn’t fizzle out like it was supposed to. It curved. Like it was changing direction. Like it knew where it was going.

“Did you see that?” I asked.

She lifted her head. “What?”

I pointed. “That...”

Maya squinted. “What am I supposed to be looking at?”
I fumbled the binoculars from the glovebox—old ones my uncle gave me for spotting deer. I raised them to my eyes.

I held them up so that Maya could see too, adjusted the focus, and froze.

Maya noticed right away. “What? What is it?”

Through the binoculars, there were figures—too many to count, all of them fast. Not like planes. More like shadows ripping across the sky, riding... something. Horses, maybe. Or things shaped like horses but wrong. Twisted. And riders—tall, thin figures wrapped in cloaks that whipped in the wind, some with skull faces, some with no faces at all. Weapons glinted in their hands. Swords. Spears. Chains.

“Oh. No,” Maya whispered. 

“What is it?” I asked.

She looked at me. “It’s heading towards the cabin.”

I snatched the binoculars back, my hands shaking so hard the image blurred. It took me three tries to steady them against my face.

She was right.

The things weren’t just in the sky anymore. They were descending, a dark wave pouring down the tree line toward the base of the mountain. Toward our road. Toward the cabin.

“We have to go. Now.” 

We scrambled into the car. I spun the tires in the dirt, wrenching the wheel toward home. The headlights carved a shaky path through the dark as we flew down the mountain road, branches slapping the windshield.
“Call my mom,” I told Maya, handing my phone to her. 
“Put it on speaker.”
The ringing seemed to last forever. Mom picked up.

“Roen? Where are you? Where’s the car?” The anger was a live wire.

“Mom, listen! You have to get everyone inside. Lock the doors. Right now.”

“What are you talking about? Are you in trouble?”

“Mom, no! Listen! There’s something coming. From the sky. We saw it. It’s coming down the mountain toward the cabin.”

A beat of dead silence. Then her tone, cold and disbelieving. “Have you been doing drugs? Is Maya with you?”

“Mom, I swear to God, I’m… Please, just look outside. Go to a window and look up toward the ridge.”

“I’m looking, Roen. I don’t see anything but trees and…” She trailed off. I heard a faint, distant sound through the phone, like bells, but twisted and metallic. “What is that noise?”

Then, Nico’s voice, excited in the background. “Mom! Mom! Look! It’s Santa’s sleigh! I see the lights!”

Kiana joined in. “Whoa! Are those reindeer?”

“Kids, get back from the window,” Mom said, but her voice had changed. The anger was gone, replaced by a slow-dawning confusion. The bells were louder now, mixed with a sound like wind tearing through a canyon.

“Mom, it’s NOT Santa!” I was yelling, my foot pressing the accelerator to the floor. The car fishtailed on a gravel curve. “Get everyone and run into the woods! Now!”

The line went quiet for one second too long. Not dead quiet—I could hear the muffled rustle of the phone in my mom’s hand, a sharp intake of breath.

Then the sounds started.

Not bells anymore. Something lower, a grinding hum that vibrated through the phone speaker. It was followed by a skittering, scraping noise, like claws on slate, getting closer. Fast.

“Marisol?” Tasha’s voice, distant and confused. “Is something on the roof?”

A thud shook the line, so heavy it made my mom gasp. Then a shriek—not human, something high and chittering.

A window shattered. A massive, bursting crunch, like something had come straight through the wall.

Then the screams started.

Not just screams of fear. These were sounds of pure, physical terror. Kiana’s high-pitched shriek cut off into a gurgle. Nico wailed, “Mommy!” before his voice was swallowed by a thick, wet thud and a crash of furniture.

“NO! GET AWAY FROM THEM!” My mom’s voice was raw, a warrior’s cry. I heard a grunt of effort, the smash of something heavy—maybe a lamp, a chair—connecting, followed by a hiss that was absolutely not human.

Tasha was cursing, a stream of furious, slurred shouts. There was a scuffle, then a body hitting the floor.

“ROEN!” My mom screamed my name into the phone. It was the last clear word.

A final, piercing shriek was cut short. Then a heavy, dragging sound. 

The line hissed with empty static for three heartbeats.

Then it went dead.

The car tore around the last bend. The cabin came into view, every window blazing with light. The front door was gone. Just a dark, open hole.

I slammed on the brakes, the car skidding to a stop fifty yards away.

The car was still ticking when I killed the engine. 
Maya grabbed my arm. “Roen. Don’t.”

I pulled free. My legs felt numb, like they didn’t belong to me anymore, but they still moved. Every step toward the house felt wrong, like I was walking into a memory that hadn’t happened yet.

The ground between us and the cabin was torn up—deep gouges in the dirt, snapped branches, something dragged straight through the yard. The porch was half gone. The roof sagged in the middle like it had been stepped on.

We desperately called our family’s names. But some part of me already knew no one would answer.
The inside smelled wrong. Something metallic and burnt.

The living room barely looked like a room anymore. Furniture smashed flat. Walls cracked. Blood everywhere—smeared, sprayed, soaked into the carpet so dark it almost looked black. Bodies were scattered where people had been standing or running.

Jay was closest to the door. Or what was left of him. His body lay twisted at an angle that didn’t make sense, like he’d been thrown. 

Bri was near the hallway. She was facedown, drowned in her own blood. One arm stretched out like she’d been reaching for someone. Malik was farther back, slumped against the wall, eyes open but empty, throat cut clean. 

Tasha was near the kitchen. Or what was left of her. Her torso was slashed open, ribs visible through torn fabric. Her head was missing. One hand was clenched around a broken bottle, like she’d tried to fight back even when it was already over.

Maya dropped to her knees.

“No, mommy, no…” she said. Over and over. 

I kept moving because if I stopped, I wasn’t sure I’d start again.

My hands were shaking so bad I had to press them into my jeans to steady myself.

“Mom,” I called out, even though I already knew.

The back room was crushed inward like something heavy had landed there.

Mom was on the floor. I knew it was her because she was curled around a smaller body.

Kiana was inside her arms, turned into my mom’s chest. Her head was gone. Just a ragged stump at her neck, soaked dark. My mom’s face was frozen mid-scream, eyes wide, mouth open, teeth bared.

I couldn’t breathe. My chest locked up, and for a second I thought I might pass out standing there.
I dropped to my knees anyway.

“I’m sorry,” I said. To both of them. To all of them. Like it might still matter.

Then, something moved.

Not the house settling. Not the wind. This was close. Wet. Fast.

I snapped my head toward the hallway and backed up on instinct, almost slipping in blood. My heart was hammering so hard it felt like it was shaking my teeth loose.

“Maya,” I said, low and sharp. “Get up. Something’s still here.”

She sucked in a breath like she’d been punched and scrambled to her feet, eyes wild. I looked around for anything that wasn’t broken or nailed down.

That’s when I saw my mom’s hand.

Tucked against her wrist, half-hidden by her sleeve, was a revolver. The snub‑nose she kept buried in the back of the closet “just in case.” I’d seen it once, years ago, when she thought my dad was coming back drunk and angry.

I knelt and pried it free, gently, like she might still feel it.

The gun was warm.

I flipped the cylinder open with shaking fingers. Five loaded chambers. One spent casing.

“She got a shot off,” I whispered. 

Maya was already moving. She grabbed a bat leaning against the wall near the tree—aluminum, cheap, still wrapped with a torn bow. Jay’s Christmas present. She peeled the plastic off and took a stance like she’d done this before.

The thing scuttled out of the hallway on all fours, moving with a broken, jerky grace. It was all wrong—a patchwork of fur and leathery skin, twisted horns, and eyes that burned like wet matches. It was big, shoulders hunched low to clear the ceiling. And on its flank, a raw, blackened crater wept thick, tar-like blood. My mom’s shot.

Our eyes met. Its jaws unhinged with a sound like cracking ice.

It charged.

I didn’t think. I raised the revolver and pulled the trigger. The first blast was deafening in the shattered room. It hit the thing in the chest, barely slowing it. I fired again. And again. The shots were too fast, my aim wild. I saw chunks of it jerk away. One shot took a piece of its ear. Another sparked off a horn.
It was on me.

The smell hit—old blood and wet earth. A claw swiped, ripping my jacket.

That’s when the bat connected.

Maya swung from the side with everything she had. The aluminum thwanged against its knee. Something cracked. The creature buckled. She swung again, a two-handed blow to its ribs. Another sickening crunch.

The creature turned on her, giving me its side. I jammed the barrel of the pistol into its ribcase and fired the last round point-blank. The thing let out a shriek of pure agony.

The creature reeled back, a spray of dark fluid gushing from the new hole in its side. It hissed, legs buckling beneath it. It took a step forward and collapsed hard, one hand clawing at the floor like it still wanted to fight. 

I stood there with the revolver hanging useless in my hand, ears ringing, lungs barely working. My jacket, my hands, my face—everything was slick with its blood. Thick, black, warm. It dripped off my fingers and splattered onto the wrecked floor like oil.

I couldn’t move. My brain felt unplugged. Like if I stayed perfectly still, none of this would be real.

“Roen.” Maya’s voice sounded far away. Then closer. “Roen—look at me.”

I didn’t.

She grabbed my wrists hard. Her hands were shaking worse than mine. “Hey. Hey. We have to go. Right now.”

I blinked. My eyes burned. “My mom… Kiana…”

“I know, babe,” she said, voice cracking but steady anyway. “But we can’t stay here.”

Something deep in me fought that. Screamed at me to stay. To do something. To not leave them like this. 

Maya tugged me toward the door. I let her.

We stumbled out into the cold night, slipping in the torn-up dirt. The air hit my face and I sucked it in like I’d been underwater too long. The sky above the cabin was alive.

Shapes moved across it—dark figures lifting off from the ground, rising in spirals and lines, mounting beasts that shouldn’t exist. Antlers. Wings. Too many legs. Too many eyes. The sound came back, clearer now: bells, laughter, howling wind.

They rose over the treeline in a long, crooked procession, silhouettes cutting across the moon. And at the front of it—
I stopped dead.

The sleigh floated higher than the rest, massive and ornate, pulled by creatures that looked like reindeer only in the loosest sense. Their bodies were stretched wrong, ribs showing through skin, eyes glowing like coals.

At the reins stood him.

Tall. Broad. Wrapped in red that looked stained in blood. His beard hung in clumps, matted and dark. His smile was too wide, teeth too many. A crown of antlers rose from his head, tangled with bells that rang wrong—deep, warped.

He reached down into the sleigh, grabbed something that kicked and screamed, and hauled it up by the arm.

Nico.

My brother thrashed, crying, his small hands clawing at the edge of the sleigh. I saw his face clearly in the firelight—terror, confusion, mouth open as he screamed my name.

“NO!” I tried to run. Maya wrapped her arms around my chest and hauled me back with everything she had.

The figure laughed. A deep, booming sound that echoed through the trees and into my bones. He shoved Nico headfirst into a bulging sack already writhing with movement—other kids, other screams—then tied it shut like it was nothing.

The sleigh lurched forward.The procession surged after it, riders whooping and shrieking as they climbed into the sky. 

Something dragged itself out of the cabin behind us.

The wounded creature. The one we thought was dead.

It staggered on three limbs, leaving a thick trail of blood across the porch and into the dirt. It let out a broken, furious cry and launched itself forward as the sleigh passed overhead.

Its claws caught the back rail of the sleigh. It slammed into the side hard, dangling there, legs kicking uselessly as the procession carried it upward. Blood sprayed out behind it in a long, dark arc, raining down through the trees.

For a few seconds, it hung on. Dragged. Refused to let go.
Then its grip failed.

The creature fell.

It vanished into the forest below with a distant, wet crash that echoed once and then went silent.

The sleigh didn’t slow.

The Santa thing threw his head back and laughed again, louder this time, like the sound itself was a victory. Then the hunt disappeared into the clouds, the bells fading until there was nothing left but wind and ruined trees and the broken shell of the cabin behind us.

—

We just sat down in the dirt a few yards from the cabin and held onto each other like if we let go, one of us would disappear too.

I don’t know how long it was. Long enough for the cold to stop mattering. Long enough for my hands to go numb around Maya’s jacket. Long enough for my brain to start doing this stupid thing where it kept trying to rewind, like maybe I’d missed a moment where I could’ve done something different.

It was Maya who finally remembered the phone.

“Roen,” she said, voice hoarse. “We have to call the police….”

My hands shook so bad I dropped my phone twice before I managed to unlock the screen. There was dried blood in the cracks of the case. I dialed 911 and put it on speaker because I didn’t trust myself to hold it.

The dispatcher’s voice was calm. Too calm.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

—

The cops showed up fast. Faster than I expected. Two cruisers at first, then more. Red and blue lights flooded the trees like some messed-up holiday display.

They separated us immediately.

Hands up. On your knees. Don’t move.

I remember one of them staring at my jacket, at the black blood smeared down my arms, and his hand never left his gun.

They asked us what happened. Over and over. Separately. Same questions, different words.

I told them there were things in the house. I told them they killed everyone. I told them they weren't human.

That was the exact moment their faces changed.

Not fear. Not concern.

Suspicion.

They cuffed my hands. Maya’s too. 

At first, they tried to pin it on me. Or maybe both of us. Kept pressing like we were hiding something, like maybe there was a fight that got out of hand, or we snapped, or it was drugs. Asked where I dumped Nico’s body.

One of the detectives took the revolver out of an evidence bag and set it on the table of the interrogation room like it was a point he’d been waiting to make.

“So you fired this?”

“Yes,” I said. “At the thing.”

“What thing?”

I looked at him. “The thing that killed my family.”

He wrote something down and nodded like that explained everything.

When the forensics team finally showed up and started putting the scene together, it got harder to make it stick. The blood patterns, the way the bodies were torn apart—none of it made sense for a standard attack. Way too violent. Way too messy. Too many injuries that didn’t line up with the weapons they found. No human did that. No animal either, far as they could tell. But they sure as hell weren’t going to write “mythical sky monsters” in the report.

Next theory? My dad.

But he was still locked up. Solid alibi. The detectives even visited him in prison to personally make sure he was still there. 
After that, they looked at Rick. Tasha’s boyfriend. Only problem? They found him too. What was left of him, anyway. His body was found near the front yard, slumped against a tree. Neck snapped like a twig.

That’s when they got quiet. No more hard questions. Just forms. Statements. A counselor.

We were minors. No surviving family. That part was simple.
Child Protect Services got involved.

They wanted to split us up. Said it was temporary, just until they could sort everything out. I got assigned a group home in Clovis. Maya got somewhere in Madera.

—

The day they told me I was getting moved, I didn’t even argue. There wasn’t any fight left. Just this empty numbness that settled behind my ribs and stayed there. The caseworker—Janine or Jenna or something—told me the social worker wanted to talk before the transfer. I figured it was some last-minute paperwork thing.

Instead, they walked me into this windowless office and shut the door behind me.

Maya was already there.

She looked as rough as I felt—pale, shadows under her baby-blue eyes. When she saw me, she blinked like she wasn’t sure I was real. We just stood there for a second.

Then she crossed the room and hugged me so hard it hurt.
I held on. Didn’t say anything. Couldn’t.

“Hey,” she said into my shoulder. Her voice shook once. “Hey,” I replied.

“I thought they sent you away already,” I said.

“Almost,” she said. “Guess we got a delay.”

We pulled apart when someone cleared their throat.

I looked up to see a woman already in the room, standing near the wall.

She was in her late thirties, maybe. She didn’t look like a social worker I’d ever seen. Didn’t smell like stale coffee or exhaustion. Black blazer and jeans. Her dark brown hair was cropped short and neat. Her hazel eyes were sharp, measuring, like she was sizing up threats.

She closed the door behind her.

“I’m glad you two got a moment to catch up,” she said calmly. “Please, sit.”

“My name is Agent Sara Benoit,” she said.

The woman waited until we were seated before she spoke again. She didn’t rush it. Let the silence stretch just long enough to feel intentional.

“I know you’ve already talked to the police,” she said. “Multiple times.”

I let out a short, tired laugh. “Then why are we here again?”
She looked at me directly. Not through me. Not like I was a problem to solve. “Because I’m not with the police.”

Maya stiffened beside me. I felt it through her sleeve.

I said, “So what? You’re a shrink? This is where you tell us we’re crazy, right?”

Benoit shook her head. “No. This is where I tell you I believe you.”

That landed heavier than any I’d heard so far.

I stared at her. “You… what?”

“I believe there was something non-human involved in the killings at that cabin,” she said. Flat. Like she was reading off a weather report. “I believe what you saw in the sky was real. And I believe the entity you described—what the media will eventually call an animal or a cult or a psychotic break—is none of those things.”

The room was quiet except for the hum of the lights.

Maya spoke up. “They said we were traumatized. That our minds filled in the gaps.”

Benoit nodded. “That’s what they have to say. It keeps things neat.”

That pissed me off more than anything else she could’ve said.

“Neat? I saw my family slaughtered,” I said. My voice stayed level, but it took work. “I watched something dressed like evil Santa kidnap my brother . If you’re about to tell me to move on, don’t.”

Benoit didn’t flinch.

“I’m not here to tell you that,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that what took your brother isn’t untouchable. And what killed your family doesn’t get to walk away clean.”

My chest tightened. Maya’s fingers found mine under the table and locked on.

I shook my head. “The fuck can you do about it? What are you? FBI? CIA? Some Men in Black knockoff with worse suits?”

She smirked at my jab, then reached into her blazer slowly, deliberately, like she didn’t want us to think she was pulling a weapon. She flipped open a leather badge wallet and slid it across the table.

‘NORAD
 Special Investigations Division’

The seal was real. The badge was heavy. Government ugly. No flair.

“…NORAD?” I said. “What’s that?”

“North American Aerospace Defense Command,” she explained. “Officially, we track airspace. Missiles. Unidentified aircraft. Anything that crosses borders where it shouldn’t.”

“What the hell does fucking NORAD want with us?” I demanded.

Benoit didn’t flinch. She just stated, “I’m here to offer you a choice.”

“A choice?” Maya asked.

She nodded. “Option one: you go to group homes, therapy, court dates. You try to live with what you saw. The official story will be ‘unknown assailants’ and ‘tragic circumstances.’ Your brother will be listed as deceased once the paperwork catches up.”

My chest burned. “And the other option?”

“Option two,” she said, her voice low and steady, “you come with me. You disappear on paper. New names, new files. You train with us. You learn what these things are, and how to kill them. Then you find the ones who did this. You get your brother back, and you make them pay.”",1,1765845330.0,scaryjujuarmy,0,1.0,False

1pnnyg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousRunning/comments/1pnnyg9/pfitz_1870_week_1_getting_through_the_work_quietly/,Pfitz 18/70 – Week 1: Getting through the work quietly,"I ran 3:01:10 at the Sydney Marathon (in my 40's) and I am aiming to go sub-3 in April 2026. To get there I have started a Pfitzinger 18/70. I've just finished week one.  
  
Overall the week went about as well as it could have. I got through the workload without drama and spent most of it mentally ticking off efforts I was happy with rather than chasing any sense of momentum or excitement. That felt appropriate for the first week of a long block.  
  
The hardest session was the LT run. Fourteen kilometres with six at LT. On paper it is not extreme but it exposed something I have been aware of for a while. My mileage has been consistent leading into this plan but I was out sick with RSV for about three weeks a few months back and I still feel, anecdotally at least, a bit weaker than I would like. The LT work felt honest rather than strong. Not a failure, just a reminder that fitness does not fully snap back on a timeline.  
  
The biggest lesson from the week had nothing to do with training theory and everything to do with sleep. I stayed up until 2am one night playing Warcraft II and paid for it across the whole week. Work, family, life and a few personal projects already stretch recovery. That one late night lingered far longer than I expected. I have caught up now but it was a timely reminder that sleep is not a bonus input in a plan like this. It is foundational.  
  
On the nutrition front I have started eating Deeks’ gluten free bread and making my own coffee at home. This is mostly a cost-cutting move rather than a deliberate dietary experiment. I am not celiac and I am not advocating for a gluten free approach. That said, I am curious whether the lower fibre content might be a bit easier on my stomach around runs. No conclusions yet. Just an observation I will keep an eye on.  
  
Nothing flashy from week one. Just work done, a couple of small lessons learned and a sense that the real test will be stacking these weeks together without getting sloppy about recovery.",1,1765845210.0,SeriousRunning,0,1.0,False

1pnnvin,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1pnnvin/my_executive_function_disappeared_this_year_and/,My executive function disappeared this year and I’m struggling with meds,"I’ve tagged this as meds, but it’s also just general advice seeking I guess. 

This year, in fact the last few years, has just been rubbish. I was diagnosed with ASD level 2 and moderate inattentive ADHD in 2024 and it was formalised by a psychiatrist in January. Since then, I’ve tried dex, Vyvanse, Vyvanse with propranolol, guanfacine and now Ritalin. I also have ME/CFS and POTS and am super sensitive to meds, which I think is making it hard to find a med that works without severe side effects. I also have a condition that weakens my carotid arteries, meaning high blood pressure can be dangerous. I don’t think tachycardia alone is an issue, it’s anything increasing the pressure in my carotids. 

Dex improved my fatigue and mood, but I felt more scattered and less able to focus on organising tasks. I also struggled with tongue thrusting and excessive sweating when the doses were higher. 

Vyvanse seemed great at first, I thought it helped my focus. But the combination of challenging life circumstances and Vyvanse seemed to gradually cause burnout, which led into significant tachycardia and mild hypertension with the Vyvanse. Propranolol was added in the hopes that lowering my heart rate would aid the burnout, but it didn’t. I ended up stopping both when I got a bad virus and had the worst ME/CFS flare I’ve had in a decade. My husband also took ages to recover from the virus so I think the flare was from that, it caused unusually bad subjective muscle weakness to the point where sitting up was hard. 

After some time off ADHD meds, I briefly retried dex and just felt the worsening of focus again. So now I’m on Ritalin. I can’t tell if it’s not helping my focus (it’s at least not making it worse) or if I’m just so burnout that nothing would help my focus. I’m having excess sweating and peeing, even though I’ve only gotten to 1-1.5 10mg tablets a day. I’m feeling so down and crying easily whenever the Ritalin isn’t in effect, but once I take it I feel so much better - my mood is lighter without being amped up, my brain just feels kind of normal instead of wanting to zone out or being stuck in a negative spiral. 

My recent life circumstances are making it hard to judge whether my challenges are burnout/depression/anxiety or medication side effects. My partner recently went to an inpatient program for 3 weeks for PTSD and alcoholism, he’s now sober and doing pretty well. I had 3 weeks of single parenting which was draining. Right before he went in, my counsellor made a child safety report which my GP and psych have agreed was very overzealous and occurred because he didn’t consider my autistic differences in communicating and processing. That event seriously fucked me up - it triggered my issues with core beliefs of incompetence, so now I’m constantly triggered if I can’t do something due to burnout and I’m pushing beyond my limits to prove to myself that I’m competent. I’m also less able to ask for help since last time I did that, it put my family at risk. I am still getting help from my GP and psych who are amazing. 

I feel like I’m the verge of making great progress and I THINK Ritalin is helping me get there, but the crashes are hard and my emotions are everywhere. And I need to be able to manage the side effects if I have any hope of staying on it. I briefly stopped it on the weekend because I felt the side effects were too much, but I’ve restarted and am having an electrolyte sugar free gatorade each day along with lots of water. I don’t drink coffee but I was having 2-3 Pepsi cans a day, so I’m limiting that to 1 so I can get more water in. I’m also struggling with appetite, I’ll get hungryish but everything sounds horrible. 

Sorry for the massive post. I have a lot in my brain and it’s hard to process right now. ",2,1765844987.0,AuDHDWomen,1,1.0,False
1pnnvab,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pnnvab/santa_kidnapped_my_brother_im_going_to_get_him/,Santa Kidnapped My Brother... I'm Going to Get Him Back (Part 1),"When dad got locked up again, it didn’t hit right away. He’d been in and out since I was nine, but this time felt different. Longer sentence. Something about assault with a weapon and parole violations. My mom, Marisol, cried once, then shut down completely. No yelling, no last minute plea to judge for leniency—just silence.

“He’s going away for at least fifteen years.”

It wasn’t news. We all knew. I’d heard her crying about it on the phone to my grandma in the Philippines through the paper-thin wall. My little sister, Kiana heard it too but didn’t say anything. Just curled up on the mattress with his headphones on, pretending she couldn’t. 

Then mom couldn’t make rent. The landlord came by with that fake sympathy, like he felt bad but not bad enough to wait one more week for rent before evicting us. 

Our house in Fresno was one of those old stucco duplexes with mold in the vents and a broken front fence. Still, it was home. 

“We’ll get a fresh start,” Mom said.

And by “fresh start,” she meant a cabin in the Sierra Nevada that looked cheap even in blurry online photos. The only reason it was so affordable was because another family—who was somehow even worse off than we were—was willing to split the cost. We’d “make it work.” Whatever that meant.

I packed my clothes in trash bags. My baby brother, Nico, clutched his PS4 the whole time like someone was gonna steal it. Mom sold the washer and our living room couch for gas money.

When we finally pulled up, the place wasn’t a cabin so much as a box with windows. The woods pressed tight around it like the trees wanted to swallow it whole.

“Looks haunted,” I muttered, stepping out of the car and staring at the place. It had a sagging roof, moss creeping up one side, and a screen door that hung off one hinge like it gave up trying years ago.

Nico’s face scrunched up. “Haunted? For real?”

I shrugged. “Guess we’ll find out tonight.”

“We will?” He whispers.

Mom shot me that look. “Seriously, Roen?” she snapped. “You think this is funny? No, baby, it’s not haunted.” She reassured Nico.

I swung one of the trash bags over my shoulder and headed for the front door. The steps creaked loud under my feet, like even they weren’t sure they could hold me. Just as I reached for the knob—
I heard voices. Two people inside, arguing loud enough that I didn’t need to strain to catch it.

“I’m not sharing a room with some random people, Mom!” Said a girl’s voice. 

A second voice fired back, older, calmer but tight with frustration. “Maya, we’ve been over this. We don’t have a choice.”

Then I heard footsteps—fast ones, heavy and pissed off, thudding through the cabin toward the door.

Before I could move out of the way or even say anything, the front door flung open hard—right into me. The edge caught me square in the shoulder and chest, knocking the air out of me as I stumbled backward and landed flat on the porch with a loud thump.

“Shit,” I muttered, wincing.

A shadow filled the doorway. I looked up and there she was—the girl, standing over me with wide eyes and a face full of panic.

“Oh my god—I didn’t see you,” she said, breathless. “Are you okay? I didn’t—God, I’m sorry.”

She knelt down a little, hand halfway out like she wasn’t sure if she should help me up or if she’d already done enough damage.

I sat up, rubbing my ribs and trying not to look like it actually hurt as bad as it did. “Yeah,” I grunted. “I mean, it’s just a screen door. Not like it was made of steel or anything.”

I grabbed her outstretched hand. Her grip was stronger than I expected, but her fingers trembled a little.

She looked about my age—sixteen, maybe seventeen—with this messy blonde braid half falling apart and a hoodie that looked like it had been through a few too many wash cycles. Her nails were painted black, chipped down to the corners. She didn’t let go of my hand right away.

Her face changed fast. Like something hot in her just shut off the second our eyes locked. The sharp edge drained out of her expression, like she forgot what she was mad about.

“I didn’t know anyone was standing out here,” she said again, softer this time. “I just... needed air.”

“It’s all good,” I said, brushing dirt off my jeans and trying to gather my spilled stuff. “Not my first time getting knocked down today.”

She glanced awkwardly back inside. “So... guess that means you’re the people we’re sharing this dump with?”

“Yup. The other half of the broke brigade.”

She held out her hand. “I’m Maya.”

I took it. “Roen.”

“Let me guess…say you’re here because of someone else’s screw-up.”

“How’s you know?” I asked surprised.

She shrugged. “Let’s just say you’re not the only one.” 

Behind me, Nico whispered, “Is she a ghost?”

Maya raised an eyebrow. “Who's that?”

“My brother. He’s eight. He’s gonna ask a million questions, so get ready.”

She smirked. “Bring it on. I’ve survived worse.”
I believed her.

Kiana was already climbing out of the car, dragging her own trash bag behind her, when she caught sight of me and Maya still talking.

“Ohhh,” she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, drawing out the sound with a stupid grin. “Roen’s already got a girlfriend in the woods.”

I rolled my eyes. “Shut up, Kiana.”

Maya snorted but didn’t say anything, just crossed her arms and waited like she was curious how this was gonna play out.

“I’m just saying,” she whispered, “you’ve known her for like two minutes and you’re already helping each other off the porch like it’s a rom-com.”

“You’re not even supposed to know what that is.”
“I’m twelve, not dumb.”

“She’s cute,” Kiana added, smirking now as she walked past. “Y’all gonna braid each other’s hair later?”

“I swear to god—”

“Language,” Mom chided from behind me. 

Before I could fire back, the front door creaked open again, and a woman stepped out. Thin, wiry frame. She wore a faded flannel and sweatpants like she’d stopped trying to impress anyone years ago. Her eyes darted across us—counting, maybe—and her smile didn’t quite reach all the way up.

“You must be the Mayumis,” she said. Her voice was raspy, probably from too many cigarettes or too many bad nights. Maybe both. “I’m Tasha. Tasha Foster.”

She stepped closer, and the smell hit me—sharp and bitter. Whiskey. 

Mom appeared behind us just in time. “Hi, I’m Marisol,” she said quietly, arms crossed like she already regretted every decision that led us here.

They hugged briefly. More of a press of shoulders than a real embrace. Tasha nodded toward the cabin. “We’re tight on space, but we cleared out the back room. Me, you, and the girls can take that. The boys can have the den.”

“Boys?” I asked, stepping into the doorway and immediately getting swarmed by noise.

Inside, it looked like someone tried to clean but gave up halfway through. There were dishes drying on one side of the sink, and unfolded laundry piled on the couch. A crusty pizza box sat on the counter next to an open bottle of something that definitely wasn’t juice.

Then came the thundering feet—three of them. First was a chubby kid with wild curls and a superhero shirt that was two sizes too small. He stopped, blinked at us, then just yelled, “New people!”

A girl around Kiana’s age followed, hair in tight braids and a glare that said she didn’t trust any of us. Behind her was a tall, lanky boy with headphones around his neck and that look teens get when they’re stuck somewhere they hate.

Maya rolled her eyes. “These are my siblings. That loud one’s Jay, the girl with the death stare is Bri, and the quiet one’s Malik.”

Jay darted toward Nico immediately, pointing at the PS4. “You got games?!”

Nico lit up. “A bunch.”

Mom and Tasha slipped into the kitchen to talk in low voices while the rest of us stood there in this weird moment of strangers under one roof. 

Maya looked around at the chaos. “So… welcome to the party.”

“Some party,” I muttered, but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth.

Kiana elbowed me. “I like it here,” she said.

—

Starting a new school in the middle of the year is trash. No one tells you where anything is, teachers already have favorites, and everybody’s locked into their little cliques like they’re afraid being friendly’s contagious.

Maya and I ended up in the same homeroom, which helped. It was the only part of the day that didn’t feel like I was walking into someone else’s house uninvited. She sat two rows over at first, headphones in, scribbling in the margins of a beat-up copy of The Bell Jar. I didn’t even know she read stuff like that.

We got paired up in Physics too—lab partners. I’m more of the “just tell me what to do and I’ll do it” type when it comes to school. I play ball. Football mostly, but I’m decent at track. Maya actually liked the subject. Asked questions. Took notes like they meant something. The first week, I thought we’d hate working together—like she’d think I was an idiot or something—but it wasn’t like that. She explained things without making it weird. 

She’d let me copy her answers—but only after I tried to understand them first.

At lunch, she sat outside under the trees near the side parking lot. Alone at first. I started joining her, ditching my usual spot with the guys.

I soon found out why she kept to herself. It started small. A few whispers behind cupped hands, little laughs when Maya walked past in the hallway. She didn’t react at first, just rolled her eyes and kept walking. But I saw the tightness in her jaw. The way her grip on her backpack straps got a little firmer.

Then one day, someone didn’t bother whispering.

The comments started behind her back—“Isn’t she the one with the crackhead mom?”, “Heard she’s got, like, four half-siblings. All different dads.” 

I felt Maya tense beside me. Not flinch—just go still, like something inside her snapped into place. She didn’t say anything. Didn’t even look at them. She just turned and walked fast, then faster, then she was running down the hall.

“Yo,” I called after her, but she was already gone.
I spun back to the group gossiping. 

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I snapped. Heads turned. Good. 

One of the guys laughed. “Relax, man. It’s just facts.”

“Facts?” I stepped closer. “You don’t know shit about her.”

The girl rolled her eyes. “She’s gonna end up just like her mom anyway. Everyone knows that.”

“Oh fuck off!” I shouted. I didn’t wait. I took off after Maya.

I checked the bathroom first. Empty. Then the quad. Nothing. My last period bell rang, but I didn’t care. I headed to the library because it was the only quiet place left in this school.

She was tucked into the far back corner, half-hidden behind the tall shelves nobody ever went to. Sitting on the floor. Knees pulled in. Hoodie sleeve pushed up.

My stomach dropped.

“Maya,” I said, low. Careful.

She didn’t look up.

I took a few slow steps closer and saw it—the razor in her hand. 

Her arm was a roadmap of old lines. Some faded. Some not.

“Hey,” I said, softer now. “Don’t.”

Her hand paused.

“You’re not allowed to say that,” she muttered. Her voice was wrecked. “You don’t get to stop me.”

“I know,” I said. “But I’m asking anyway.”

She laughed once, sharp and ugly. “They’re right, you know. About me. About all of it.”

I crouched down in front of her, keeping my hands where she could see them. “They don’t know you.”

“They know enough,” she said. “My mom’s an addict. She disappears for days. Sometimes weeks. We all got different dads. None of them stuck. People hear that and they already got my ending figured out.”

“You’re not,” I said.

She lifted the razor slightly. “You don’t know that.”

She finally looked at me. Her blue eyes were red, furious, tired. “You think I don’t see it? I’m already halfway there.”

I swallowed. “I know what it’s like when everyone assumes you’re trash because of who raised you.”
That got her attention.

“My dad’s been locked up most of my life,” I said. “I’ve got scars too.” I tapped my knuckles. Old marks. “From standing up to him when I shouldn’t have. From thinking I could fix things if I just tried harder.”
She stared at my hands like she was seeing them for the first time.

“I used to think if I didn’t fight back, I’d turn into him,” I went on. “Turns out, fighting him didn’t make me better either. Just made everything louder.”

Her grip on the razor loosened a little.

I reached out slowly. “Can you give me that?”

She hesitated. Long enough that my heart was pounding in my ears. Then she dropped the razor into my palm like it weighed a thousand pounds.

She covered her face and finally broke.

I stayed there. Didn’t try to fix it. Didn’t say the wrong hopeful crap. Just sat on the library floor with her while she cried it out.

—
​​That night, I knocked on Maya’s door after everyone had crashed.

“I have an idea,” I whispered. “It’s mean though…”
Maya smirked. “The meaner the better.”

That morning, we showed up to school early. We had backpacks full of supplies—a screwdriver, glitter, expired sardines, and four tiny tubes of industrial-strength superglue.

We snuck into the locker hallway when the janitor went for his smoke break. Maya kept lookout while I unscrewed the hinges on three locker doors—each one belonging to the worst of the trash-talkers. We laced the inside edges with glue, so when they slammed shut like usual, they’d stay that way. 

Inside one of them, we left a glitter bomb rigged to pop the second the door opened. In another, Maya stuffed the expired sardines into a pencil pouch and superglued that shut too. The smell would hit like a punch in the face.

We barely made it to homeroom before the chaos started.

First period: screaming from the hallway. Second period: a janitor with bolt cutters. By third period, the whole school was buzzing.

And then we got called to the office.

We got caught on cameras. Of course. We didn’t even try to lie. Just sat there while the vice principal read us the suspension notice like he was personally offended.

“Three days. Home. No extracurriculars. You’re lucky we’re not calling the police.”

Outside the office, Maya bumped my shoulder. “Worth it?”

I grinned. “Every second.”

—

I got my permit that November. Mom let me borrow the car sometimes, mostly because she was too tired to argue. We made it count—gas station dinners, thrift store photo shoots, late-night drives to nowhere.

We’d sneak out some nights just to lie in the truck bed and stare at the stars through the trees, counting satellites and pretending they were escape pods.

The first time she kissed me, it wasn’t planned. We were sitting in the school parking lot, waiting for the rain to let up. She just looked over and said, “I’m gonna do something stupid,” then leaned in before I could ask what. After that, it all moved fast.

The first time we had sex was in the back of the car, parked on an old forestry road, all fumbling hands and held breath. We thought we were careful.

The scare happened two weeks later. A late period, a pregnancy test from the pharmacy. The longest three minutes of our lives, standing in that cabin’s moldy bathroom, waiting. When it was negative, we didn’t celebrate. She laughed. I almost cried.

After that, we thought more about the future. Maya started talking about college more. Somewhere far. I didn’t have plans like that, but I was working weekends at the pizza shop, and started saving. Not for clothes or games—just for getting out. 

—

By December, things settled down a bit. We tried to make the best of the holidays. All month, the cabin smelled like pine and mildew and cheap cinnamon candles. We’d managed to scrape together some decorations—paper snowflakes, a string of busted lights that only half worked, and a sad fake tree we found at the thrift store for five bucks. Nico hung plastic ornaments like it was the real deal. Kiana made hot cocoa from a dollar store mix and forced everyone to drink it. Mom even smiled a few times, though it never lasted.

Maya and I did our part. Helped the little kids wrap presents in newspaper. Made jokes about how Santa probably skipped our cabin because the GPS gave up halfway up the mountain. 

Even Tasha seemed mellow for once.

But then Christmas Eve hit. 

Maya’s mom announced that afternoon she was inviting her new boyfriend over for dinner. Some dude named Rick or Rich or something. Maya went quiet first, then full-on exploded.

“You’re kidding, right?” she snapped. “You’re really bringing some random guy here? On Christmas Eve?”

Tasha shrugged like it was no big deal. “He’s not random. I’ve known him for months.”

“And that makes it fucking okay? And now we’re supposed to play happy family?”

“Watch your mouth.”

“Or what? You’ll vanish for a week and pretend this never happened?”

Tasha lit a cigarette inside the house, which she only did when she was mad. “It’s my house, Maya. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”

Maya laughed. “Gladly.”

She grabbed her bag and was out the door before I could say anything. I followed.

We sat on the steps while the cold settled into our bones. She didn’t talk. Just stared out at the trees, fists clenched in her lap like she was holding herself together by force. I leaned over, bumped her shoulder.

“Let’s bounce.”

She looked at me. “Where?""

“Anywhere but here.”

So we sneaked out. I borrowed Mom’s car.

We drove up to a dirt road, way up past the ranger station, where the trees cleared and gave you this wide, unreal view of the valley below. You could see for miles.

I popped the trunk, and we sat with our legs hanging out the back, wrapped in a blanket. I pulled out the six-pack I’d stashed—some knockoff lager from that corner store near school that never asked questions. Maya lit a joint she’d swiped from her mom’s stash and passed it to me without saying anything.

We just sat there, knees touching, sipping beer and smoking the joint, watching our breath cloud up in the freezing air. Maya played music off her phone, low. Some old indie Christmas playlist she’d downloaded for the irony.

At one point, she leaned her head on my shoulder.

“Thanks,” she whispered.

“For what?”

“For giving me something that doesn’t suck.”

—

Maya was humming some half-forgotten carol when I noticed it—this streak of light cutting across the night sky, low and fast. At first I thought it was just a shooting star, but it didn’t fizzle out like it was supposed to. It curved. Like it was changing direction. Like it knew where it was going.

“Did you see that?” I asked.

She lifted her head. “What?”

I pointed. “That...”

Maya squinted. “What am I supposed to be looking at?”
I fumbled the binoculars from the glovebox—old ones my uncle gave me for spotting deer. I raised them to my eyes.

I held them up so that Maya could see too, adjusted the focus, and froze.

Maya noticed right away. “What? What is it?”

Through the binoculars, there were figures—too many to count, all of them fast. Not like planes. More like shadows ripping across the sky, riding... something. Horses, maybe. Or things shaped like horses but wrong. Twisted. And riders—tall, thin figures wrapped in cloaks that whipped in the wind, some with skull faces, some with no faces at all. Weapons glinted in their hands. Swords. Spears. Chains.

“Oh. No,” Maya whispered. 

“What is it?” I asked.

She looked at me. “It’s heading towards the cabin.”

I snatched the binoculars back, my hands shaking so hard the image blurred. It took me three tries to steady them against my face.

She was right.

The things weren’t just in the sky anymore. They were descending, a dark wave pouring down the tree line toward the base of the mountain. Toward our road. Toward the cabin.

“We have to go. Now.” 

We scrambled into the car. I spun the tires in the dirt, wrenching the wheel toward home. The headlights carved a shaky path through the dark as we flew down the mountain road, branches slapping the windshield.
“Call my mom,” I told Maya, handing my phone to her. 
“Put it on speaker.”
The ringing seemed to last forever. Mom picked up.

“Roen? Where are you? Where’s the car?” The anger was a live wire.

“Mom, listen! You have to get everyone inside. Lock the doors. Right now.”

“What are you talking about? Are you in trouble?”

“Mom, no! Listen! There’s something coming. From the sky. We saw it. It’s coming down the mountain toward the cabin.”

A beat of dead silence. Then her tone, cold and disbelieving. “Have you been doing drugs? Is Maya with you?”

“Mom, I swear to God, I’m… Please, just look outside. Go to a window and look up toward the ridge.”

“I’m looking, Roen. I don’t see anything but trees and…” She trailed off. I heard a faint, distant sound through the phone, like bells, but twisted and metallic. “What is that noise?”

Then, Nico’s voice, excited in the background. “Mom! Mom! Look! It’s Santa’s sleigh! I see the lights!”

Kiana joined in. “Whoa! Are those reindeer?”

“Kids, get back from the window,” Mom said, but her voice had changed. The anger was gone, replaced by a slow-dawning confusion. The bells were louder now, mixed with a sound like wind tearing through a canyon.

“Mom, it’s NOT Santa!” I was yelling, my foot pressing the accelerator to the floor. The car fishtailed on a gravel curve. “Get everyone and run into the woods! Now!”

The line went quiet for one second too long. Not dead quiet—I could hear the muffled rustle of the phone in my mom’s hand, a sharp intake of breath.

Then the sounds started.

Not bells anymore. Something lower, a grinding hum that vibrated through the phone speaker. It was followed by a skittering, scraping noise, like claws on slate, getting closer. Fast.

“Marisol?” Tasha’s voice, distant and confused. “Is something on the roof?”

A thud shook the line, so heavy it made my mom gasp. Then a shriek—not human, something high and chittering.

A window shattered. A massive, bursting crunch, like something had come straight through the wall.

Then the screams started.

Not just screams of fear. These were sounds of pure, physical terror. Kiana’s high-pitched shriek cut off into a gurgle. Nico wailed, “Mommy!” before his voice was swallowed by a thick, wet thud and a crash of furniture.

“NO! GET AWAY FROM THEM!” My mom’s voice was raw, a warrior’s cry. I heard a grunt of effort, the smash of something heavy—maybe a lamp, a chair—connecting, followed by a hiss that was absolutely not human.

Tasha was cursing, a stream of furious, slurred shouts. There was a scuffle, then a body hitting the floor.

“ROEN!” My mom screamed my name into the phone. It was the last clear word.

A final, piercing shriek was cut short. Then a heavy, dragging sound. 

The line hissed with empty static for three heartbeats.

Then it went dead.

The car tore around the last bend. The cabin came into view, every window blazing with light. The front door was gone. Just a dark, open hole.

I slammed on the brakes, the car skidding to a stop fifty yards away.

The car was still ticking when I killed the engine. 
Maya grabbed my arm. “Roen. Don’t.”

I pulled free. My legs felt numb, like they didn’t belong to me anymore, but they still moved. Every step toward the house felt wrong, like I was walking into a memory that hadn’t happened yet.

The ground between us and the cabin was torn up—deep gouges in the dirt, snapped branches, something dragged straight through the yard. The porch was half gone. The roof sagged in the middle like it had been stepped on.

We desperately called our family’s names. But some part of me already knew no one would answer.
The inside smelled wrong. Something metallic and burnt.

The living room barely looked like a room anymore. Furniture smashed flat. Walls cracked. Blood everywhere—smeared, sprayed, soaked into the carpet so dark it almost looked black. Bodies were scattered where people had been standing or running.

Jay was closest to the door. Or what was left of him. His body lay twisted at an angle that didn’t make sense, like he’d been thrown. 

Bri was near the hallway. She was facedown, drowned in her own blood. One arm stretched out like she’d been reaching for someone. Malik was farther back, slumped against the wall, eyes open but empty, throat cut clean. 

Tasha was near the kitchen. Or what was left of her. Her torso was slashed open, ribs visible through torn fabric. Her head was missing. One hand was clenched around a broken bottle, like she’d tried to fight back even when it was already over.

Maya dropped to her knees.

“No, mommy, no…” she said. Over and over. 

I kept moving because if I stopped, I wasn’t sure I’d start again.

My hands were shaking so bad I had to press them into my jeans to steady myself.

“Mom,” I called out, even though I already knew.

The back room was crushed inward like something heavy had landed there.

Mom was on the floor. I knew it was her because she was curled around a smaller body.

Kiana was inside her arms, turned into my mom’s chest. Her head was gone. Just a ragged stump at her neck, soaked dark. My mom’s face was frozen mid-scream, eyes wide, mouth open, teeth bared.

I couldn’t breathe. My chest locked up, and for a second I thought I might pass out standing there.
I dropped to my knees anyway.

“I’m sorry,” I said. To both of them. To all of them. Like it might still matter.

Then, something moved.

Not the house settling. Not the wind. This was close. Wet. Fast.

I snapped my head toward the hallway and backed up on instinct, almost slipping in blood. My heart was hammering so hard it felt like it was shaking my teeth loose.

“Maya,” I said, low and sharp. “Get up. Something’s still here.”

She sucked in a breath like she’d been punched and scrambled to her feet, eyes wild. I looked around for anything that wasn’t broken or nailed down.

That’s when I saw my mom’s hand.

Tucked against her wrist, half-hidden by her sleeve, was a revolver. The snub‑nose she kept buried in the back of the closet “just in case.” I’d seen it once, years ago, when she thought my dad was coming back drunk and angry.

I knelt and pried it free, gently, like she might still feel it.

The gun was warm.

I flipped the cylinder open with shaking fingers. Five loaded chambers. One spent casing.

“She got a shot off,” I whispered. 

Maya was already moving. She grabbed a bat leaning against the wall near the tree—aluminum, cheap, still wrapped with a torn bow. Jay’s Christmas present. She peeled the plastic off and took a stance like she’d done this before.

The thing scuttled out of the hallway on all fours, moving with a broken, jerky grace. It was all wrong—a patchwork of fur and leathery skin, twisted horns, and eyes that burned like wet matches. It was big, shoulders hunched low to clear the ceiling. And on its flank, a raw, blackened crater wept thick, tar-like blood. My mom’s shot.

Our eyes met. Its jaws unhinged with a sound like cracking ice.

It charged.

I didn’t think. I raised the revolver and pulled the trigger. The first blast was deafening in the shattered room. It hit the thing in the chest, barely slowing it. I fired again. And again. The shots were too fast, my aim wild. I saw chunks of it jerk away. One shot took a piece of its ear. Another sparked off a horn.
It was on me.

The smell hit—old blood and wet earth. A claw swiped, ripping my jacket.

That’s when the bat connected.

Maya swung from the side with everything she had. The aluminum thwanged against its knee. Something cracked. The creature buckled. She swung again, a two-handed blow to its ribs. Another sickening crunch.

The creature turned on her, giving me its side. I jammed the barrel of the pistol into its ribcase and fired the last round point-blank. The thing let out a shriek of pure agony.

The creature reeled back, a spray of dark fluid gushing from the new hole in its side. It hissed, legs buckling beneath it. It took a step forward and collapsed hard, one hand clawing at the floor like it still wanted to fight. 

I stood there with the revolver hanging useless in my hand, ears ringing, lungs barely working. My jacket, my hands, my face—everything was slick with its blood. Thick, black, warm. It dripped off my fingers and splattered onto the wrecked floor like oil.

I couldn’t move. My brain felt unplugged. Like if I stayed perfectly still, none of this would be real.

“Roen.” Maya’s voice sounded far away. Then closer. “Roen—look at me.”

I didn’t.

She grabbed my wrists hard. Her hands were shaking worse than mine. “Hey. Hey. We have to go. Right now.”

I blinked. My eyes burned. “My mom… Kiana…”

“I know, babe,” she said, voice cracking but steady anyway. “But we can’t stay here.”

Something deep in me fought that. Screamed at me to stay. To do something. To not leave them like this. 

Maya tugged me toward the door. I let her.

We stumbled out into the cold night, slipping in the torn-up dirt. The air hit my face and I sucked it in like I’d been underwater too long. The sky above the cabin was alive.

Shapes moved across it—dark figures lifting off from the ground, rising in spirals and lines, mounting beasts that shouldn’t exist. Antlers. Wings. Too many legs. Too many eyes. The sound came back, clearer now: bells, laughter, howling wind.

They rose over the treeline in a long, crooked procession, silhouettes cutting across the moon. And at the front of it—
I stopped dead.

The sleigh floated higher than the rest, massive and ornate, pulled by creatures that looked like reindeer only in the loosest sense. Their bodies were stretched wrong, ribs showing through skin, eyes glowing like coals.

At the reins stood him.

Tall. Broad. Wrapped in red that looked stained in blood. His beard hung in clumps, matted and dark. His smile was too wide, teeth too many. A crown of antlers rose from his head, tangled with bells that rang wrong—deep, warped.

He reached down into the sleigh, grabbed something that kicked and screamed, and hauled it up by the arm.

Nico.

My brother thrashed, crying, his small hands clawing at the edge of the sleigh. I saw his face clearly in the firelight—terror, confusion, mouth open as he screamed my name.

“NO!” I tried to run. Maya wrapped her arms around my chest and hauled me back with everything she had.

The figure laughed. A deep, booming sound that echoed through the trees and into my bones. He shoved Nico headfirst into a bulging sack already writhing with movement—other kids, other screams—then tied it shut like it was nothing.

The sleigh lurched forward.The procession surged after it, riders whooping and shrieking as they climbed into the sky. 

Something dragged itself out of the cabin behind us.

The wounded creature. The one we thought was dead.

It staggered on three limbs, leaving a thick trail of blood across the porch and into the dirt. It let out a broken, furious cry and launched itself forward as the sleigh passed overhead.

Its claws caught the back rail of the sleigh. It slammed into the side hard, dangling there, legs kicking uselessly as the procession carried it upward. Blood sprayed out behind it in a long, dark arc, raining down through the trees.

For a few seconds, it hung on. Dragged. Refused to let go.
Then its grip failed.

The creature fell.

It vanished into the forest below with a distant, wet crash that echoed once and then went silent.

The sleigh didn’t slow.

The Santa thing threw his head back and laughed again, louder this time, like the sound itself was a victory. Then the hunt disappeared into the clouds, the bells fading until there was nothing left but wind and ruined trees and the broken shell of the cabin behind us.

—

We just sat down in the dirt a few yards from the cabin and held onto each other like if we let go, one of us would disappear too.

I don’t know how long it was. Long enough for the cold to stop mattering. Long enough for my hands to go numb around Maya’s jacket. Long enough for my brain to start doing this stupid thing where it kept trying to rewind, like maybe I’d missed a moment where I could’ve done something different.

It was Maya who finally remembered the phone.

“Roen,” she said, voice hoarse. “We have to call the police….”

My hands shook so bad I dropped my phone twice before I managed to unlock the screen. There was dried blood in the cracks of the case. I dialed 911 and put it on speaker because I didn’t trust myself to hold it.

The dispatcher’s voice was calm. Too calm.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

—

The cops showed up fast. Faster than I expected. Two cruisers at first, then more. Red and blue lights flooded the trees like some messed-up holiday display.

They separated us immediately.

Hands up. On your knees. Don’t move.

I remember one of them staring at my jacket, at the black blood smeared down my arms, and his hand never left his gun.

They asked us what happened. Over and over. Separately. Same questions, different words.

I told them there were things in the house. I told them they killed everyone. I told them they weren't human.

That was the exact moment their faces changed.

Not fear. Not concern.

Suspicion.

They cuffed my hands. Maya’s too. 

At first, they tried to pin it on me. Or maybe both of us. Kept pressing like we were hiding something, like maybe there was a fight that got out of hand, or we snapped, or it was drugs. Asked where I dumped Nico’s body.

One of the detectives took the revolver out of an evidence bag and set it on the table of the interrogation room like it was a point he’d been waiting to make.

“So you fired this?”

“Yes,” I said. “At the thing.”

“What thing?”

I looked at him. “The thing that killed my family.”

He wrote something down and nodded like that explained everything.

When the forensics team finally showed up and started putting the scene together, it got harder to make it stick. The blood patterns, the way the bodies were torn apart—none of it made sense for a standard attack. Way too violent. Way too messy. Too many injuries that didn’t line up with the weapons they found. No human did that. No animal either, far as they could tell. But they sure as hell weren’t going to write “mythical sky monsters” in the report.

Next theory? My dad.

But he was still locked up. Solid alibi. The detectives even visited him in prison to personally make sure he was still there. 
After that, they looked at Rick. Tasha’s boyfriend. Only problem? They found him too. What was left of him, anyway. His body was found near the front yard, slumped against a tree. Neck snapped like a twig.

That’s when they got quiet. No more hard questions. Just forms. Statements. A counselor.

We were minors. No surviving family. That part was simple.
Child Protect Services got involved.

They wanted to split us up. Said it was temporary, just until they could sort everything out. I got assigned a group home in Clovis. Maya got somewhere in Madera.

—

The day they told me I was getting moved, I didn’t even argue. There wasn’t any fight left. Just this empty numbness that settled behind my ribs and stayed there. The caseworker—Janine or Jenna or something—told me the social worker wanted to talk before the transfer. I figured it was some last-minute paperwork thing.

Instead, they walked me into this windowless office and shut the door behind me.

Maya was already there.

She looked as rough as I felt—pale, shadows under her baby-blue eyes. When she saw me, she blinked like she wasn’t sure I was real. We just stood there for a second.

Then she crossed the room and hugged me so hard it hurt.
I held on. Didn’t say anything. Couldn’t.

“Hey,” she said into my shoulder. Her voice shook once. “Hey,” I replied.

“I thought they sent you away already,” I said.

“Almost,” she said. “Guess we got a delay.”

We pulled apart when someone cleared their throat.

I looked up to see a woman already in the room, standing near the wall.

She was in her late thirties, maybe. She didn’t look like a social worker I’d ever seen. Didn’t smell like stale coffee or exhaustion. Black blazer and jeans. Her dark brown hair was cropped short and neat. Her hazel eyes were sharp, measuring, like she was sizing up threats.

She closed the door behind her.

“I’m glad you two got a moment to catch up,” she said calmly. “Please, sit.”

“My name is Agent Sara Benoit,” she said.

The woman waited until we were seated before she spoke again. She didn’t rush it. Let the silence stretch just long enough to feel intentional.

“I know you’ve already talked to the police,” she said. “Multiple times.”

I let out a short, tired laugh. “Then why are we here again?”
She looked at me directly. Not through me. Not like I was a problem to solve. “Because I’m not with the police.”

Maya stiffened beside me. I felt it through her sleeve.

I said, “So what? You’re a shrink? This is where you tell us we’re crazy, right?”

Benoit shook her head. “No. This is where I tell you I believe you.”

That landed heavier than any I’d heard so far.

I stared at her. “You… what?”

“I believe there was something non-human involved in the killings at that cabin,” she said. Flat. Like she was reading off a weather report. “I believe what you saw in the sky was real. And I believe the entity you described—what the media will eventually call an animal or a cult or a psychotic break—is none of those things.”

The room was quiet except for the hum of the lights.

Maya spoke up. “They said we were traumatized. That our minds filled in the gaps.”

Benoit nodded. “That’s what they have to say. It keeps things neat.”

That pissed me off more than anything else she could’ve said.

“Neat? I saw my family slaughtered,” I said. My voice stayed level, but it took work. “I watched something dressed like evil Santa kidnap my brother . If you’re about to tell me to move on, don’t.”

Benoit didn’t flinch.

“I’m not here to tell you that,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that what took your brother isn’t untouchable. And what killed your family doesn’t get to walk away clean.”

My chest tightened. Maya’s fingers found mine under the table and locked on.

I shook my head. “The fuck can you do about it? What are you? FBI? CIA? Some Men in Black knockoff with worse suits?”

She smirked at my jab, then reached into her blazer slowly, deliberately, like she didn’t want us to think she was pulling a weapon. She flipped open a leather badge wallet and slid it across the table.

‘NORAD
 Special Investigations Division’

The seal was real. The badge was heavy. Government ugly. No flair.

“…NORAD?” I said. “What’s that?”

“North American Aerospace Defense Command,” she explained. “Officially, we track airspace. Missiles. Unidentified aircraft. Anything that crosses borders where it shouldn’t.”

“What the hell does fucking NORAD want with us?” I demanded.

Benoit didn’t flinch. She just stated, “I’m here to offer you a choice.”

“A choice?” Maya asked.

She nodded. “Option one: you go to group homes, therapy, court dates. You try to live with what you saw. The official story will be ‘unknown assailants’ and ‘tragic circumstances.’ Your brother will be listed as deceased once the paperwork catches up.”

My chest burned. “And the other option?”

“Option two,” she said, her voice low and steady, “you come with me. You disappear on paper. New names, new files. You train with us. You learn what these things are, and how to kill them. Then you find the ones who did this. You get your brother back, and you make them pay.”",1,1765844970.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I'm Going to Get Him Back (Part 1),"When dad got locked up again, it didn’t hit right away. He’d been in and out since I was nine, but this time felt different. Longer sentence. Something about assault with a weapon and parole violations. My mom, Marisol, cried once, then shut down completely. No yelling, no last minute plea to judge for leniency—just silence.

“He’s going away for at least fifteen years.”

It wasn’t news. We all knew. I’d heard her crying about it on the phone to my grandma in the Philippines through the paper-thin wall. My little sister, Kiana heard it too but didn’t say anything. Just curled up on the mattress with his headphones on, pretending she couldn’t. 

Then mom couldn’t make rent. The landlord came by with that fake sympathy, like he felt bad but not bad enough to wait one more week for rent before evicting us. 

Our house in Fresno was one of those old stucco duplexes with mold in the vents and a broken front fence. Still, it was home. 

“We’ll get a fresh start,” Mom said.

And by “fresh start,” she meant a cabin in the Sierra Nevada that looked cheap even in blurry online photos. The only reason it was so affordable was because another family—who was somehow even worse off than we were—was willing to split the cost. We’d “make it work.” Whatever that meant.

I packed my clothes in trash bags. My baby brother, Nico, clutched his PS4 the whole time like someone was gonna steal it. Mom sold the washer and our living room couch for gas money.

When we finally pulled up, the place wasn’t a cabin so much as a box with windows. The woods pressed tight around it like the trees wanted to swallow it whole.

“Looks haunted,” I muttered, stepping out of the car and staring at the place. It had a sagging roof, moss creeping up one side, and a screen door that hung off one hinge like it gave up trying years ago.

Nico’s face scrunched up. “Haunted? For real?”

I shrugged. “Guess we’ll find out tonight.”

“We will?” He whispers.

Mom shot me that look. “Seriously, Roen?” she snapped. “You think this is funny? No, baby, it’s not haunted.” She reassured Nico.

I swung one of the trash bags over my shoulder and headed for the front door. The steps creaked loud under my feet, like even they weren’t sure they could hold me. Just as I reached for the knob—
I heard voices. Two people inside, arguing loud enough that I didn’t need to strain to catch it.

“I’m not sharing a room with some random people, Mom!” Said a girl’s voice. 

A second voice fired back, older, calmer but tight with frustration. “Maya, we’ve been over this. We don’t have a choice.”

Then I heard footsteps—fast ones, heavy and pissed off, thudding through the cabin toward the door.

Before I could move out of the way or even say anything, the front door flung open hard—right into me. The edge caught me square in the shoulder and chest, knocking the air out of me as I stumbled backward and landed flat on the porch with a loud thump.

“Shit,” I muttered, wincing.

A shadow filled the doorway. I looked up and there she was—the girl, standing over me with wide eyes and a face full of panic.

“Oh my god—I didn’t see you,” she said, breathless. “Are you okay? I didn’t—God, I’m sorry.”

She knelt down a little, hand halfway out like she wasn’t sure if she should help me up or if she’d already done enough damage.

I sat up, rubbing my ribs and trying not to look like it actually hurt as bad as it did. “Yeah,” I grunted. “I mean, it’s just a screen door. Not like it was made of steel or anything.”

I grabbed her outstretched hand. Her grip was stronger than I expected, but her fingers trembled a little.

She looked about my age—sixteen, maybe seventeen—with this messy blonde braid half falling apart and a hoodie that looked like it had been through a few too many wash cycles. Her nails were painted black, chipped down to the corners. She didn’t let go of my hand right away.

Her face changed fast. Like something hot in her just shut off the second our eyes locked. The sharp edge drained out of her expression, like she forgot what she was mad about.

“I didn’t know anyone was standing out here,” she said again, softer this time. “I just... needed air.”

“It’s all good,” I said, brushing dirt off my jeans and trying to gather my spilled stuff. “Not my first time getting knocked down today.”

She glanced awkwardly back inside. “So... guess that means you’re the people we’re sharing this dump with?”

“Yup. The other half of the broke brigade.”

She held out her hand. “I’m Maya.”

I took it. “Roen.”

“Let me guess…say you’re here because of someone else’s screw-up.”

“How’s you know?” I asked surprised.

She shrugged. “Let’s just say you’re not the only one.” 

Behind me, Nico whispered, “Is she a ghost?”

Maya raised an eyebrow. “Who's that?”

“My brother. He’s eight. He’s gonna ask a million questions, so get ready.”

She smirked. “Bring it on. I’ve survived worse.”
I believed her.

Kiana was already climbing out of the car, dragging her own trash bag behind her, when she caught sight of me and Maya still talking.

“Ohhh,” she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, drawing out the sound with a stupid grin. “Roen’s already got a girlfriend in the woods.”

I rolled my eyes. “Shut up, Kiana.”

Maya snorted but didn’t say anything, just crossed her arms and waited like she was curious how this was gonna play out.

“I’m just saying,” she whispered, “you’ve known her for like two minutes and you’re already helping each other off the porch like it’s a rom-com.”

“You’re not even supposed to know what that is.”
“I’m twelve, not dumb.”

“She’s cute,” Kiana added, smirking now as she walked past. “Y’all gonna braid each other’s hair later?”

“I swear to god—”

“Language,” Mom chided from behind me. 

Before I could fire back, the front door creaked open again, and a woman stepped out. Thin, wiry frame. She wore a faded flannel and sweatpants like she’d stopped trying to impress anyone years ago. Her eyes darted across us—counting, maybe—and her smile didn’t quite reach all the way up.

“You must be the Mayumis,” she said. Her voice was raspy, probably from too many cigarettes or too many bad nights. Maybe both. “I’m Tasha. Tasha Foster.”

She stepped closer, and the smell hit me—sharp and bitter. Whiskey. 

Mom appeared behind us just in time. “Hi, I’m Marisol,” she said quietly, arms crossed like she already regretted every decision that led us here.

They hugged briefly. More of a press of shoulders than a real embrace. Tasha nodded toward the cabin. “We’re tight on space, but we cleared out the back room. Me, you, and the girls can take that. The boys can have the den.”

“Boys?” I asked, stepping into the doorway and immediately getting swarmed by noise.

Inside, it looked like someone tried to clean but gave up halfway through. There were dishes drying on one side of the sink, and unfolded laundry piled on the couch. A crusty pizza box sat on the counter next to an open bottle of something that definitely wasn’t juice.

Then came the thundering feet—three of them. First was a chubby kid with wild curls and a superhero shirt that was two sizes too small. He stopped, blinked at us, then just yelled, “New people!”

A girl around Kiana’s age followed, hair in tight braids and a glare that said she didn’t trust any of us. Behind her was a tall, lanky boy with headphones around his neck and that look teens get when they’re stuck somewhere they hate.

Maya rolled her eyes. “These are my siblings. That loud one’s Jay, the girl with the death stare is Bri, and the quiet one’s Malik.”

Jay darted toward Nico immediately, pointing at the PS4. “You got games?!”

Nico lit up. “A bunch.”

Mom and Tasha slipped into the kitchen to talk in low voices while the rest of us stood there in this weird moment of strangers under one roof. 

Maya looked around at the chaos. “So… welcome to the party.”

“Some party,” I muttered, but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth.

Kiana elbowed me. “I like it here,” she said.

—

Starting a new school in the middle of the year is trash. No one tells you where anything is, teachers already have favorites, and everybody’s locked into their little cliques like they’re afraid being friendly’s contagious.

Maya and I ended up in the same homeroom, which helped. It was the only part of the day that didn’t feel like I was walking into someone else’s house uninvited. She sat two rows over at first, headphones in, scribbling in the margins of a beat-up copy of The Bell Jar. I didn’t even know she read stuff like that.

We got paired up in Physics too—lab partners. I’m more of the “just tell me what to do and I’ll do it” type when it comes to school. I play ball. Football mostly, but I’m decent at track. Maya actually liked the subject. Asked questions. Took notes like they meant something. The first week, I thought we’d hate working together—like she’d think I was an idiot or something—but it wasn’t like that. She explained things without making it weird. 

She’d let me copy her answers—but only after I tried to understand them first.

At lunch, she sat outside under the trees near the side parking lot. Alone at first. I started joining her, ditching my usual spot with the guys.

I soon found out why she kept to herself. It started small. A few whispers behind cupped hands, little laughs when Maya walked past in the hallway. She didn’t react at first, just rolled her eyes and kept walking. But I saw the tightness in her jaw. The way her grip on her backpack straps got a little firmer.

Then one day, someone didn’t bother whispering.

The comments started behind her back—“Isn’t she the one with the crackhead mom?”, “Heard she’s got, like, four half-siblings. All different dads.” 

I felt Maya tense beside me. Not flinch—just go still, like something inside her snapped into place. She didn’t say anything. Didn’t even look at them. She just turned and walked fast, then faster, then she was running down the hall.

“Yo,” I called after her, but she was already gone.
I spun back to the group gossiping. 

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I snapped. Heads turned. Good. 

One of the guys laughed. “Relax, man. It’s just facts.”

“Facts?” I stepped closer. “You don’t know shit about her.”

The girl rolled her eyes. “She’s gonna end up just like her mom anyway. Everyone knows that.”

“Oh fuck off!” I shouted. I didn’t wait. I took off after Maya.

I checked the bathroom first. Empty. Then the quad. Nothing. My last period bell rang, but I didn’t care. I headed to the library because it was the only quiet place left in this school.

She was tucked into the far back corner, half-hidden behind the tall shelves nobody ever went to. Sitting on the floor. Knees pulled in. Hoodie sleeve pushed up.

My stomach dropped.

“Maya,” I said, low. Careful.

She didn’t look up.

I took a few slow steps closer and saw it—the razor in her hand. 

Her arm was a roadmap of old lines. Some faded. Some not.

“Hey,” I said, softer now. “Don’t.”

Her hand paused.

“You’re not allowed to say that,” she muttered. Her voice was wrecked. “You don’t get to stop me.”

“I know,” I said. “But I’m asking anyway.”

She laughed once, sharp and ugly. “They’re right, you know. About me. About all of it.”

I crouched down in front of her, keeping my hands where she could see them. “They don’t know you.”

“They know enough,” she said. “My mom’s an addict. She disappears for days. Sometimes weeks. We all got different dads. None of them stuck. People hear that and they already got my ending figured out.”

“You’re not,” I said.

She lifted the razor slightly. “You don’t know that.”

She finally looked at me. Her blue eyes were red, furious, tired. “You think I don’t see it? I’m already halfway there.”

I swallowed. “I know what it’s like when everyone assumes you’re trash because of who raised you.”
That got her attention.

“My dad’s been locked up most of my life,” I said. “I’ve got scars too.” I tapped my knuckles. Old marks. “From standing up to him when I shouldn’t have. From thinking I could fix things if I just tried harder.”
She stared at my hands like she was seeing them for the first time.

“I used to think if I didn’t fight back, I’d turn into him,” I went on. “Turns out, fighting him didn’t make me better either. Just made everything louder.”

Her grip on the razor loosened a little.

I reached out slowly. “Can you give me that?”

She hesitated. Long enough that my heart was pounding in my ears. Then she dropped the razor into my palm like it weighed a thousand pounds.

She covered her face and finally broke.

I stayed there. Didn’t try to fix it. Didn’t say the wrong hopeful crap. Just sat on the library floor with her while she cried it out.

—
​​That night, I knocked on Maya’s door after everyone had crashed.

“I have an idea,” I whispered. “It’s mean though…”
Maya smirked. “The meaner the better.”

That morning, we showed up to school early. We had backpacks full of supplies—a screwdriver, glitter, expired sardines, and four tiny tubes of industrial-strength superglue.

We snuck into the locker hallway when the janitor went for his smoke break. Maya kept lookout while I unscrewed the hinges on three locker doors—each one belonging to the worst of the trash-talkers. We laced the inside edges with glue, so when they slammed shut like usual, they’d stay that way. 

Inside one of them, we left a glitter bomb rigged to pop the second the door opened. In another, Maya stuffed the expired sardines into a pencil pouch and superglued that shut too. The smell would hit like a punch in the face.

We barely made it to homeroom before the chaos started.

First period: screaming from the hallway. Second period: a janitor with bolt cutters. By third period, the whole school was buzzing.

And then we got called to the office.

We got caught on cameras. Of course. We didn’t even try to lie. Just sat there while the vice principal read us the suspension notice like he was personally offended.

“Three days. Home. No extracurriculars. You’re lucky we’re not calling the police.”

Outside the office, Maya bumped my shoulder. “Worth it?”

I grinned. “Every second.”

—

I got my permit that November. Mom let me borrow the car sometimes, mostly because she was too tired to argue. We made it count—gas station dinners, thrift store photo shoots, late-night drives to nowhere.

We’d sneak out some nights just to lie in the truck bed and stare at the stars through the trees, counting satellites and pretending they were escape pods.

The first time she kissed me, it wasn’t planned. We were sitting in the school parking lot, waiting for the rain to let up. She just looked over and said, “I’m gonna do something stupid,” then leaned in before I could ask what. After that, it all moved fast.

The first time we had sex was in the back of the car, parked on an old forestry road, all fumbling hands and held breath. We thought we were careful.

The scare happened two weeks later. A late period, a pregnancy test from the pharmacy. The longest three minutes of our lives, standing in that cabin’s moldy bathroom, waiting. When it was negative, we didn’t celebrate. She laughed. I almost cried.

After that, we thought more about the future. Maya started talking about college more. Somewhere far. I didn’t have plans like that, but I was working weekends at the pizza shop, and started saving. Not for clothes or games—just for getting out. 

—

By December, things settled down a bit. We tried to make the best of the holidays. All month, the cabin smelled like pine and mildew and cheap cinnamon candles. We’d managed to scrape together some decorations—paper snowflakes, a string of busted lights that only half worked, and a sad fake tree we found at the thrift store for five bucks. Nico hung plastic ornaments like it was the real deal. Kiana made hot cocoa from a dollar store mix and forced everyone to drink it. Mom even smiled a few times, though it never lasted.

Maya and I did our part. Helped the little kids wrap presents in newspaper. Made jokes about how Santa probably skipped our cabin because the GPS gave up halfway up the mountain. 

Even Tasha seemed mellow for once.

But then Christmas Eve hit. 

Maya’s mom announced that afternoon she was inviting her new boyfriend over for dinner. Some dude named Rick or Rich or something. Maya went quiet first, then full-on exploded.

“You’re kidding, right?” she snapped. “You’re really bringing some random guy here? On Christmas Eve?”

Tasha shrugged like it was no big deal. “He’s not random. I’ve known him for months.”

“And that makes it fucking okay? And now we’re supposed to play happy family?”

“Watch your mouth.”

“Or what? You’ll vanish for a week and pretend this never happened?”

Tasha lit a cigarette inside the house, which she only did when she was mad. “It’s my house, Maya. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”

Maya laughed. “Gladly.”

She grabbed her bag and was out the door before I could say anything. I followed.

We sat on the steps while the cold settled into our bones. She didn’t talk. Just stared out at the trees, fists clenched in her lap like she was holding herself together by force. I leaned over, bumped her shoulder.

“Let’s bounce.”

She looked at me. “Where?""

“Anywhere but here.”

So we sneaked out. I borrowed Mom’s car.

We drove up to a dirt road, way up past the ranger station, where the trees cleared and gave you this wide, unreal view of the valley below. You could see for miles.

I popped the trunk, and we sat with our legs hanging out the back, wrapped in a blanket. I pulled out the six-pack I’d stashed—some knockoff lager from that corner store near school that never asked questions. Maya lit a joint she’d swiped from her mom’s stash and passed it to me without saying anything.

We just sat there, knees touching, sipping beer and smoking the joint, watching our breath cloud up in the freezing air. Maya played music off her phone, low. Some old indie Christmas playlist she’d downloaded for the irony.

At one point, she leaned her head on my shoulder.

“Thanks,” she whispered.

“For what?”

“For giving me something that doesn’t suck.”

—

Maya was humming some half-forgotten carol when I noticed it—this streak of light cutting across the night sky, low and fast. At first I thought it was just a shooting star, but it didn’t fizzle out like it was supposed to. It curved. Like it was changing direction. Like it knew where it was going.

“Did you see that?” I asked.

She lifted her head. “What?”

I pointed. “That...”

Maya squinted. “What am I supposed to be looking at?”
I fumbled the binoculars from the glovebox—old ones my uncle gave me for spotting deer. I raised them to my eyes.

I held them up so that Maya could see too, adjusted the focus, and froze.

Maya noticed right away. “What? What is it?”

Through the binoculars, there were figures—too many to count, all of them fast. Not like planes. More like shadows ripping across the sky, riding... something. Horses, maybe. Or things shaped like horses but wrong. Twisted. And riders—tall, thin figures wrapped in cloaks that whipped in the wind, some with skull faces, some with no faces at all. Weapons glinted in their hands. Swords. Spears. Chains.

“Oh. No,” Maya whispered. 

“What is it?” I asked.

She looked at me. “It’s heading towards the cabin.”

I snatched the binoculars back, my hands shaking so hard the image blurred. It took me three tries to steady them against my face.

She was right.

The things weren’t just in the sky anymore. They were descending, a dark wave pouring down the tree line toward the base of the mountain. Toward our road. Toward the cabin.

“We have to go. Now.” 

We scrambled into the car. I spun the tires in the dirt, wrenching the wheel toward home. The headlights carved a shaky path through the dark as we flew down the mountain road, branches slapping the windshield.
“Call my mom,” I told Maya, handing my phone to her. 
“Put it on speaker.”
The ringing seemed to last forever. Mom picked up.

“Roen? Where are you? Where’s the car?” The anger was a live wire.

“Mom, listen! You have to get everyone inside. Lock the doors. Right now.”

“What are you talking about? Are you in trouble?”

“Mom, no! Listen! There’s something coming. From the sky. We saw it. It’s coming down the mountain toward the cabin.”

A beat of dead silence. Then her tone, cold and disbelieving. “Have you been doing drugs? Is Maya with you?”

“Mom, I swear to God, I’m… Please, just look outside. Go to a window and look up toward the ridge.”

“I’m looking, Roen. I don’t see anything but trees and…” She trailed off. I heard a faint, distant sound through the phone, like bells, but twisted and metallic. “What is that noise?”

Then, Nico’s voice, excited in the background. “Mom! Mom! Look! It’s Santa’s sleigh! I see the lights!”

Kiana joined in. “Whoa! Are those reindeer?”

“Kids, get back from the window,” Mom said, but her voice had changed. The anger was gone, replaced by a slow-dawning confusion. The bells were louder now, mixed with a sound like wind tearing through a canyon.

“Mom, it’s NOT Santa!” I was yelling, my foot pressing the accelerator to the floor. The car fishtailed on a gravel curve. “Get everyone and run into the woods! Now!”

The line went quiet for one second too long. Not dead quiet—I could hear the muffled rustle of the phone in my mom’s hand, a sharp intake of breath.

Then the sounds started.

Not bells anymore. Something lower, a grinding hum that vibrated through the phone speaker. It was followed by a skittering, scraping noise, like claws on slate, getting closer. Fast.

“Marisol?” Tasha’s voice, distant and confused. “Is something on the roof?”

A thud shook the line, so heavy it made my mom gasp. Then a shriek—not human, something high and chittering.

A window shattered. A massive, bursting crunch, like something had come straight through the wall.

Then the screams started.

Not just screams of fear. These were sounds of pure, physical terror. Kiana’s high-pitched shriek cut off into a gurgle. Nico wailed, “Mommy!” before his voice was swallowed by a thick, wet thud and a crash of furniture.

“NO! GET AWAY FROM THEM!” My mom’s voice was raw, a warrior’s cry. I heard a grunt of effort, the smash of something heavy—maybe a lamp, a chair—connecting, followed by a hiss that was absolutely not human.

Tasha was cursing, a stream of furious, slurred shouts. There was a scuffle, then a body hitting the floor.

“ROEN!” My mom screamed my name into the phone. It was the last clear word.

A final, piercing shriek was cut short. Then a heavy, dragging sound. 

The line hissed with empty static for three heartbeats.

Then it went dead.

The car tore around the last bend. The cabin came into view, every window blazing with light. The front door was gone. Just a dark, open hole.

I slammed on the brakes, the car skidding to a stop fifty yards away.

The car was still ticking when I killed the engine. 
Maya grabbed my arm. “Roen. Don’t.”

I pulled free. My legs felt numb, like they didn’t belong to me anymore, but they still moved. Every step toward the house felt wrong, like I was walking into a memory that hadn’t happened yet.

The ground between us and the cabin was torn up—deep gouges in the dirt, snapped branches, something dragged straight through the yard. The porch was half gone. The roof sagged in the middle like it had been stepped on.

We desperately called our family’s names. But some part of me already knew no one would answer.
The inside smelled wrong. Something metallic and burnt.

The living room barely looked like a room anymore. Furniture smashed flat. Walls cracked. Blood everywhere—smeared, sprayed, soaked into the carpet so dark it almost looked black. Bodies were scattered where people had been standing or running.

Jay was closest to the door. Or what was left of him. His body lay twisted at an angle that didn’t make sense, like he’d been thrown. 

Bri was near the hallway. She was facedown, drowned in her own blood. One arm stretched out like she’d been reaching for someone. Malik was farther back, slumped against the wall, eyes open but empty, throat cut clean. 

Tasha was near the kitchen. Or what was left of her. Her torso was slashed open, ribs visible through torn fabric. Her head was missing. One hand was clenched around a broken bottle, like she’d tried to fight back even when it was already over.

Maya dropped to her knees.

“No, mommy, no…” she said. Over and over. 

I kept moving because if I stopped, I wasn’t sure I’d start again.

My hands were shaking so bad I had to press them into my jeans to steady myself.

“Mom,” I called out, even though I already knew.

The back room was crushed inward like something heavy had landed there.

Mom was on the floor. I knew it was her because she was curled around a smaller body.

Kiana was inside her arms, turned into my mom’s chest. Her head was gone. Just a ragged stump at her neck, soaked dark. My mom’s face was frozen mid-scream, eyes wide, mouth open, teeth bared.

I couldn’t breathe. My chest locked up, and for a second I thought I might pass out standing there.
I dropped to my knees anyway.

“I’m sorry,” I said. To both of them. To all of them. Like it might still matter.

Then, something moved.

Not the house settling. Not the wind. This was close. Wet. Fast.

I snapped my head toward the hallway and backed up on instinct, almost slipping in blood. My heart was hammering so hard it felt like it was shaking my teeth loose.

“Maya,” I said, low and sharp. “Get up. Something’s still here.”

She sucked in a breath like she’d been punched and scrambled to her feet, eyes wild. I looked around for anything that wasn’t broken or nailed down.

That’s when I saw my mom’s hand.

Tucked against her wrist, half-hidden by her sleeve, was a revolver. The snub‑nose she kept buried in the back of the closet “just in case.” I’d seen it once, years ago, when she thought my dad was coming back drunk and angry.

I knelt and pried it free, gently, like she might still feel it.

The gun was warm.

I flipped the cylinder open with shaking fingers. Five loaded chambers. One spent casing.

“She got a shot off,” I whispered. 

Maya was already moving. She grabbed a bat leaning against the wall near the tree—aluminum, cheap, still wrapped with a torn bow. Jay’s Christmas present. She peeled the plastic off and took a stance like she’d done this before.

The thing scuttled out of the hallway on all fours, moving with a broken, jerky grace. It was all wrong—a patchwork of fur and leathery skin, twisted horns, and eyes that burned like wet matches. It was big, shoulders hunched low to clear the ceiling. And on its flank, a raw, blackened crater wept thick, tar-like blood. My mom’s shot.

Our eyes met. Its jaws unhinged with a sound like cracking ice.

It charged.

I didn’t think. I raised the revolver and pulled the trigger. The first blast was deafening in the shattered room. It hit the thing in the chest, barely slowing it. I fired again. And again. The shots were too fast, my aim wild. I saw chunks of it jerk away. One shot took a piece of its ear. Another sparked off a horn.
It was on me.

The smell hit—old blood and wet earth. A claw swiped, ripping my jacket.

That’s when the bat connected.

Maya swung from the side with everything she had. The aluminum thwanged against its knee. Something cracked. The creature buckled. She swung again, a two-handed blow to its ribs. Another sickening crunch.

The creature turned on her, giving me its side. I jammed the barrel of the pistol into its ribcase and fired the last round point-blank. The thing let out a shriek of pure agony.

The creature reeled back, a spray of dark fluid gushing from the new hole in its side. It hissed, legs buckling beneath it. It took a step forward and collapsed hard, one hand clawing at the floor like it still wanted to fight. 

I stood there with the revolver hanging useless in my hand, ears ringing, lungs barely working. My jacket, my hands, my face—everything was slick with its blood. Thick, black, warm. It dripped off my fingers and splattered onto the wrecked floor like oil.

I couldn’t move. My brain felt unplugged. Like if I stayed perfectly still, none of this would be real.

“Roen.” Maya’s voice sounded far away. Then closer. “Roen—look at me.”

I didn’t.

She grabbed my wrists hard. Her hands were shaking worse than mine. “Hey. Hey. We have to go. Right now.”

I blinked. My eyes burned. “My mom… Kiana…”

“I know, babe,” she said, voice cracking but steady anyway. “But we can’t stay here.”

Something deep in me fought that. Screamed at me to stay. To do something. To not leave them like this. 

Maya tugged me toward the door. I let her.

We stumbled out into the cold night, slipping in the torn-up dirt. The air hit my face and I sucked it in like I’d been underwater too long. The sky above the cabin was alive.

Shapes moved across it—dark figures lifting off from the ground, rising in spirals and lines, mounting beasts that shouldn’t exist. Antlers. Wings. Too many legs. Too many eyes. The sound came back, clearer now: bells, laughter, howling wind.

They rose over the treeline in a long, crooked procession, silhouettes cutting across the moon. And at the front of it—
I stopped dead.

The sleigh floated higher than the rest, massive and ornate, pulled by creatures that looked like reindeer only in the loosest sense. Their bodies were stretched wrong, ribs showing through skin, eyes glowing like coals.

At the reins stood him.

Tall. Broad. Wrapped in red that looked stained in blood. His beard hung in clumps, matted and dark. His smile was too wide, teeth too many. A crown of antlers rose from his head, tangled with bells that rang wrong—deep, warped.

He reached down into the sleigh, grabbed something that kicked and screamed, and hauled it up by the arm.

Nico.

My brother thrashed, crying, his small hands clawing at the edge of the sleigh. I saw his face clearly in the firelight—terror, confusion, mouth open as he screamed my name.

“NO!” I tried to run. Maya wrapped her arms around my chest and hauled me back with everything she had.

The figure laughed. A deep, booming sound that echoed through the trees and into my bones. He shoved Nico headfirst into a bulging sack already writhing with movement—other kids, other screams—then tied it shut like it was nothing.

The sleigh lurched forward.The procession surged after it, riders whooping and shrieking as they climbed into the sky. 

Something dragged itself out of the cabin behind us.

The wounded creature. The one we thought was dead.

It staggered on three limbs, leaving a thick trail of blood across the porch and into the dirt. It let out a broken, furious cry and launched itself forward as the sleigh passed overhead.

Its claws caught the back rail of the sleigh. It slammed into the side hard, dangling there, legs kicking uselessly as the procession carried it upward. Blood sprayed out behind it in a long, dark arc, raining down through the trees.

For a few seconds, it hung on. Dragged. Refused to let go.
Then its grip failed.

The creature fell.

It vanished into the forest below with a distant, wet crash that echoed once and then went silent.

The sleigh didn’t slow.

The Santa thing threw his head back and laughed again, louder this time, like the sound itself was a victory. Then the hunt disappeared into the clouds, the bells fading until there was nothing left but wind and ruined trees and the broken shell of the cabin behind us.

—

We just sat down in the dirt a few yards from the cabin and held onto each other like if we let go, one of us would disappear too.

I don’t know how long it was. Long enough for the cold to stop mattering. Long enough for my hands to go numb around Maya’s jacket. Long enough for my brain to start doing this stupid thing where it kept trying to rewind, like maybe I’d missed a moment where I could’ve done something different.

It was Maya who finally remembered the phone.

“Roen,” she said, voice hoarse. “We have to call the police….”

My hands shook so bad I dropped my phone twice before I managed to unlock the screen. There was dried blood in the cracks of the case. I dialed 911 and put it on speaker because I didn’t trust myself to hold it.

The dispatcher’s voice was calm. Too calm.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

—

The cops showed up fast. Faster than I expected. Two cruisers at first, then more. Red and blue lights flooded the trees like some messed-up holiday display.

They separated us immediately.

Hands up. On your knees. Don’t move.

I remember one of them staring at my jacket, at the black blood smeared down my arms, and his hand never left his gun.

They asked us what happened. Over and over. Separately. Same questions, different words.

I told them there were things in the house. I told them they killed everyone. I told them they weren't human.

That was the exact moment their faces changed.

Not fear. Not concern.

Suspicion.

They cuffed my hands. Maya’s too. 

At first, they tried to pin it on me. Or maybe both of us. Kept pressing like we were hiding something, like maybe there was a fight that got out of hand, or we snapped, or it was drugs. Asked where I dumped Nico’s body.

One of the detectives took the revolver out of an evidence bag and set it on the table of the interrogation room like it was a point he’d been waiting to make.

“So you fired this?”

“Yes,” I said. “At the thing.”

“What thing?”

I looked at him. “The thing that killed my family.”

He wrote something down and nodded like that explained everything.

When the forensics team finally showed up and started putting the scene together, it got harder to make it stick. The blood patterns, the way the bodies were torn apart—none of it made sense for a standard attack. Way too violent. Way too messy. Too many injuries that didn’t line up with the weapons they found. No human did that. No animal either, far as they could tell. But they sure as hell weren’t going to write “mythical sky monsters” in the report.

Next theory? My dad.

But he was still locked up. Solid alibi. The detectives even visited him in prison to personally make sure he was still there. 
After that, they looked at Rick. Tasha’s boyfriend. Only problem? They found him too. What was left of him, anyway. His body was found near the front yard, slumped against a tree. Neck snapped like a twig.

That’s when they got quiet. No more hard questions. Just forms. Statements. A counselor.

We were minors. No surviving family. That part was simple.
Child Protect Services got involved.

They wanted to split us up. Said it was temporary, just until they could sort everything out. I got assigned a group home in Clovis. Maya got somewhere in Madera.

—

The day they told me I was getting moved, I didn’t even argue. There wasn’t any fight left. Just this empty numbness that settled behind my ribs and stayed there. The caseworker—Janine or Jenna or something—told me the social worker wanted to talk before the transfer. I figured it was some last-minute paperwork thing.

Instead, they walked me into this windowless office and shut the door behind me.

Maya was already there.

She looked as rough as I felt—pale, shadows under her baby-blue eyes. When she saw me, she blinked like she wasn’t sure I was real. We just stood there for a second.

Then she crossed the room and hugged me so hard it hurt.
I held on. Didn’t say anything. Couldn’t.

“Hey,” she said into my shoulder. Her voice shook once. “Hey,” I replied.

“I thought they sent you away already,” I said.

“Almost,” she said. “Guess we got a delay.”

We pulled apart when someone cleared their throat.

I looked up to see a woman already in the room, standing near the wall.

She was in her late thirties, maybe. She didn’t look like a social worker I’d ever seen. Didn’t smell like stale coffee or exhaustion. Black blazer and jeans. Her dark brown hair was cropped short and neat. Her hazel eyes were sharp, measuring, like she was sizing up threats.

She closed the door behind her.

“I’m glad you two got a moment to catch up,” she said calmly. “Please, sit.”

“My name is Agent Sara Benoit,” she said.

The woman waited until we were seated before she spoke again. She didn’t rush it. Let the silence stretch just long enough to feel intentional.

“I know you’ve already talked to the police,” she said. “Multiple times.”

I let out a short, tired laugh. “Then why are we here again?”
She looked at me directly. Not through me. Not like I was a problem to solve. “Because I’m not with the police.”

Maya stiffened beside me. I felt it through her sleeve.

I said, “So what? You’re a shrink? This is where you tell us we’re crazy, right?”

Benoit shook her head. “No. This is where I tell you I believe you.”

That landed heavier than any I’d heard so far.

I stared at her. “You… what?”

“I believe there was something non-human involved in the killings at that cabin,” she said. Flat. Like she was reading off a weather report. “I believe what you saw in the sky was real. And I believe the entity you described—what the media will eventually call an animal or a cult or a psychotic break—is none of those things.”

The room was quiet except for the hum of the lights.

Maya spoke up. “They said we were traumatized. That our minds filled in the gaps.”

Benoit nodded. “That’s what they have to say. It keeps things neat.”

That pissed me off more than anything else she could’ve said.

“Neat? I saw my family slaughtered,” I said. My voice stayed level, but it took work. “I watched something dressed like evil Santa kidnap my brother . If you’re about to tell me to move on, don’t.”

Benoit didn’t flinch.

“I’m not here to tell you that,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that what took your brother isn’t untouchable. And what killed your family doesn’t get to walk away clean.”

My chest tightened. Maya’s fingers found mine under the table and locked on.

I shook my head. “The fuck can you do about it? What are you? FBI? CIA? Some Men in Black knockoff with worse suits?”

She smirked at my jab, then reached into her blazer slowly, deliberately, like she didn’t want us to think she was pulling a weapon. She flipped open a leather badge wallet and slid it across the table.

‘NORAD
 Special Investigations Division’

The seal was real. The badge was heavy. Government ugly. No flair.

“…NORAD?” I said. “What’s that?”

“North American Aerospace Defense Command,” she explained. “Officially, we track airspace. Missiles. Unidentified aircraft. Anything that crosses borders where it shouldn’t.”

“What the hell does fucking NORAD want with us?” I demanded.

Benoit didn’t flinch. She just stated, “I’m here to offer you a choice.”

“A choice?” Maya asked.

She nodded. “Option one: you go to group homes, therapy, court dates. You try to live with what you saw. The official story will be ‘unknown assailants’ and ‘tragic circumstances.’ Your brother will be listed as deceased once the paperwork catches up.”

My chest burned. “And the other option?”

“Option two,” she said, her voice low and steady, “you come with me. You disappear on paper. New names, new files. You train with us. You learn what these things are, and how to kill them. Then you find the ones who did this. You get your brother back, and you make them pay.”",1,1765844883.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

1pnntr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pnntr9/women_algorithm_problems/,Women algorithm problems,"26M here, Im seeing this girl and I really like her, im a cowboy and so is she is a cowgirl we both do rodeos and we really kicked it off together, we were a bit too fast i think we still are, we already did some questionable things especially in the first 24 hours of our start of dating but we come to a point where we genuinely love eachother and we say the forbidden 3 word phrase to eachother now. But I wanna talk about somethings that are exemplary of my past experiences aswell as some of the posts ive read here that are similar topic of being too fast nor too slow and it comes down to ego, time, pace and growth with a side note of bad endings

From what I learned is if you're going fast the girl will feel overwhelmed and thought that you're bypassing the boundaries and self values. She will leave because she got scared that you're too clingy or develops a fear of commitment with someone so fast.

The next part is that if you're too slow she will get bored of the process and will end up seeing other men for balanced options or is simply thinking that it will go no where. Loss of interest due to lack of enough effort nor thinks that you're putting the balanced effort into someone else(even if you really aren't and is trying to be slow because you scared someone off by being fast)

The thing is women will hardly tell you if you're too fast or too boring slow mostly till they build up their ego by seeing someone else then they tell you, which often destroys a man dignity and confidence in dating(ladies, my advice if you do this to people, dont be ego biased and atleast tell the ""fast and clingy"" or  ""slow and boring"" guy that you're not interested before you do something like this again) the man is learning the ropes maybe again and he's most likely trying effort in these ways because he definitely did get left for both being slow nor fast paced.

!FOR THE HOMEBOYS!

I've had my fair share of experiences like this and I learned my lesson to give the 6 month rule of being slow but show effort of interest. Dates here and there dont be afraid to spend a little bit of cash boys most girls love to go to bars, dinners, arcades, bowling alleys, darts, table pool, night or day rides around the city, town or hamlet or countryside you name it but never movie theater cause thats boring and waste of time.

I beg to differ about the whole ""lock the ring on her quick before someone else does"" because you have to tap the brakes.

love bombing, being nice, often kind to others, liking other women's posts/pictures, even having a female friend while trying to see a girl will TURN HER OFF
Love bombing too early overwhelms the ladies they can hardly love anyone too soon trust me bro theres no actual such thing as love at first sight anymore.

Being nice/kind to other females including gentlemen like gestures will have her see how you value other women on an equal basis as her will result her leaving due to how ""easy"" you really look like. Many women want the gentleman treatment reserved to themselves only to feel like an absolute priority.

Social media standards-Having high snapchat score/friends, Instagram likes/follows/followers, Facebook friends and certain friends will have her question herself that shes easily replaceable and have no problem walking out because a female who looks as good as the girl youre seeing heart reacted to your pictures and you liked their comment. Dont be such a Horn-dog and follow models and have a bunch of randomly added female friend or follow. Those girls on your lists are her competitors to her it seems and she dont want a competition, she wants to feel like you think that shes the one and only that youre interested in dating.

Make her feel like you're interested in her only, take her out often but not too much, dont be physically intimate too soon-ive had sex on first days quite a lot and most of the time it fails for feelings wise sometime down the road,

Dont go for lovey dovey stuff too soon first date can be as simple of a coffee date because most women dont like it when an expensive date is the first date. First date can be free as a walk in the park. Dont hold hands either dont be in anyway physical too soon give yourself a week or two. HOLD BACK ON THE TEXTING AND CALLING! Texting and making too much plans or becoming too personal too soon in the conversations can lead to her getting unease. Keep it short and simple for a bit and gradually increase your messages. Dont call or text at every waking hour of the days because she also has a life too. Give her time to reply dont bomb text her to get her attention she'll feel like youre pressuring her to reply with her notifications buzzing her all the time. 

Dont forgot to surprise her with little gifts sometimes like a flower a rose to be exact or maybe a stuffed animal just something that women generally find cute

PS appearance and first impressions better to the type of women you really are interested ""the prettiest girl in the state province type shi obviously""

If she breaks your confidence based on your weight, bro you're more than welcome to come meet us at the gym and change your diet, there is coaching programs that are affordable and highly recommended.

Literally boys take your time... 9 out of 10 women like it slow, some women like it fast but usually those are the desperate nor emotionally difficult ones and you dont want someone that needs little or no work to get to loving YOU trust me I did it and I couldn't keep up myself.

Now here's the end but I would like to hear opinions from females of their experiences in the comments,  how they can improve their dating experiences and how they handle when their date is a bit too FAST or Boring SLOW or TOO SLOW.

THERE WILL BE NO JUDGING THE COMMENT AUTHORS based on their decisions on how they handled their situations.",0,1765844860.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

I'm Going to Get Him Back (Part 1),"When dad got locked up again, it didn’t hit right away. He’d been in and out since I was nine, but this time felt different. Longer sentence. Something about assault with a weapon and parole violations. My mom, Marisol, cried once, then shut down completely. No yelling, no last minute plea to judge for leniency—just silence.

“He’s going away for at least fifteen years.”

It wasn’t news. We all knew. I’d heard her crying about it on the phone to my grandma in the Philippines through the paper-thin wall. My little sister, Kiana heard it too but didn’t say anything. Just curled up on the mattress with his headphones on, pretending she couldn’t. 

Then mom couldn’t make rent. The landlord came by with that fake sympathy, like he felt bad but not bad enough to wait one more week for rent before evicting us. 

Our house in Fresno was one of those old stucco duplexes with mold in the vents and a broken front fence. Still, it was home. 

“We’ll get a fresh start,” Mom said.

And by “fresh start,” she meant a cabin in the Sierra Nevada that looked cheap even in blurry online photos. The only reason it was so affordable was because another family—who was somehow even worse off than we were—was willing to split the cost. We’d “make it work.” Whatever that meant.

I packed my clothes in trash bags. My baby brother, Nico, clutched his PS4 the whole time like someone was gonna steal it. Mom sold the washer and our living room couch for gas money.

When we finally pulled up, the place wasn’t a cabin so much as a box with windows. The woods pressed tight around it like the trees wanted to swallow it whole.

“Looks haunted,” I muttered, stepping out of the car and staring at the place. It had a sagging roof, moss creeping up one side, and a screen door that hung off one hinge like it gave up trying years ago.

Nico’s face scrunched up. “Haunted? For real?”

I shrugged. “Guess we’ll find out tonight.”

“We will?” He whispers.

Mom shot me that look. “Seriously, Roen?” she snapped. “You think this is funny? No, baby, it’s not haunted.” She reassured Nico.

I swung one of the trash bags over my shoulder and headed for the front door. The steps creaked loud under my feet, like even they weren’t sure they could hold me. Just as I reached for the knob—
I heard voices. Two people inside, arguing loud enough that I didn’t need to strain to catch it.

“I’m not sharing a room with some random people, Mom!” Said a girl’s voice. 

A second voice fired back, older, calmer but tight with frustration. “Maya, we’ve been over this. We don’t have a choice.”

Then I heard footsteps—fast ones, heavy and pissed off, thudding through the cabin toward the door.

Before I could move out of the way or even say anything, the front door flung open hard—right into me. The edge caught me square in the shoulder and chest, knocking the air out of me as I stumbled backward and landed flat on the porch with a loud thump.

“Shit,” I muttered, wincing.

A shadow filled the doorway. I looked up and there she was—the girl, standing over me with wide eyes and a face full of panic.

“Oh my god—I didn’t see you,” she said, breathless. “Are you okay? I didn’t—God, I’m sorry.”

She knelt down a little, hand halfway out like she wasn’t sure if she should help me up or if she’d already done enough damage.

I sat up, rubbing my ribs and trying not to look like it actually hurt as bad as it did. “Yeah,” I grunted. “I mean, it’s just a screen door. Not like it was made of steel or anything.”

I grabbed her outstretched hand. Her grip was stronger than I expected, but her fingers trembled a little.

She looked about my age—sixteen, maybe seventeen—with this messy blonde braid half falling apart and a hoodie that looked like it had been through a few too many wash cycles. Her nails were painted black, chipped down to the corners. She didn’t let go of my hand right away.

Her face changed fast. Like something hot in her just shut off the second our eyes locked. The sharp edge drained out of her expression, like she forgot what she was mad about.

“I didn’t know anyone was standing out here,” she said again, softer this time. “I just... needed air.”

“It’s all good,” I said, brushing dirt off my jeans and trying to gather my spilled stuff. “Not my first time getting knocked down today.”

She glanced awkwardly back inside. “So... guess that means you’re the people we’re sharing this dump with?”

“Yup. The other half of the broke brigade.”

She held out her hand. “I’m Maya.”

I took it. “Roen.”

“Let me guess…say you’re here because of someone else’s screw-up.”

“How’s you know?” I asked surprised.

She shrugged. “Let’s just say you’re not the only one.” 

Behind me, Nico whispered, “Is she a ghost?”

Maya raised an eyebrow. “Who's that?”

“My brother. He’s eight. He’s gonna ask a million questions, so get ready.”

She smirked. “Bring it on. I’ve survived worse.”
I believed her.

Kiana was already climbing out of the car, dragging her own trash bag behind her, when she caught sight of me and Maya still talking.

“Ohhh,” she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, drawing out the sound with a stupid grin. “Roen’s already got a girlfriend in the woods.”

I rolled my eyes. “Shut up, Kiana.”

Maya snorted but didn’t say anything, just crossed her arms and waited like she was curious how this was gonna play out.

“I’m just saying,” she whispered, “you’ve known her for like two minutes and you’re already helping each other off the porch like it’s a rom-com.”

“You’re not even supposed to know what that is.”
“I’m twelve, not dumb.”

“She’s cute,” Kiana added, smirking now as she walked past. “Y’all gonna braid each other’s hair later?”

“I swear to god—”

“Language,” Mom chided from behind me. 

Before I could fire back, the front door creaked open again, and a woman stepped out. Thin, wiry frame. She wore a faded flannel and sweatpants like she’d stopped trying to impress anyone years ago. Her eyes darted across us—counting, maybe—and her smile didn’t quite reach all the way up.

“You must be the Mayumis,” she said. Her voice was raspy, probably from too many cigarettes or too many bad nights. Maybe both. “I’m Tasha. Tasha Foster.”

She stepped closer, and the smell hit me—sharp and bitter. Whiskey. 

Mom appeared behind us just in time. “Hi, I’m Marisol,” she said quietly, arms crossed like she already regretted every decision that led us here.

They hugged briefly. More of a press of shoulders than a real embrace. Tasha nodded toward the cabin. “We’re tight on space, but we cleared out the back room. Me, you, and the girls can take that. The boys can have the den.”

“Boys?” I asked, stepping into the doorway and immediately getting swarmed by noise.

Inside, it looked like someone tried to clean but gave up halfway through. There were dishes drying on one side of the sink, and unfolded laundry piled on the couch. A crusty pizza box sat on the counter next to an open bottle of something that definitely wasn’t juice.

Then came the thundering feet—three of them. First was a chubby kid with wild curls and a superhero shirt that was two sizes too small. He stopped, blinked at us, then just yelled, “New people!”

A girl around Kiana’s age followed, hair in tight braids and a glare that said she didn’t trust any of us. Behind her was a tall, lanky boy with headphones around his neck and that look teens get when they’re stuck somewhere they hate.

Maya rolled her eyes. “These are my siblings. That loud one’s Jay, the girl with the death stare is Bri, and the quiet one’s Malik.”

Jay darted toward Nico immediately, pointing at the PS4. “You got games?!”

Nico lit up. “A bunch.”

Mom and Tasha slipped into the kitchen to talk in low voices while the rest of us stood there in this weird moment of strangers under one roof. 

Maya looked around at the chaos. “So… welcome to the party.”

“Some party,” I muttered, but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth.

Kiana elbowed me. “I like it here,” she said.

—

Starting a new school in the middle of the year is trash. No one tells you where anything is, teachers already have favorites, and everybody’s locked into their little cliques like they’re afraid being friendly’s contagious.

Maya and I ended up in the same homeroom, which helped. It was the only part of the day that didn’t feel like I was walking into someone else’s house uninvited. She sat two rows over at first, headphones in, scribbling in the margins of a beat-up copy of The Bell Jar. I didn’t even know she read stuff like that.

We got paired up in Physics too—lab partners. I’m more of the “just tell me what to do and I’ll do it” type when it comes to school. I play ball. Football mostly, but I’m decent at track. Maya actually liked the subject. Asked questions. Took notes like they meant something. The first week, I thought we’d hate working together—like she’d think I was an idiot or something—but it wasn’t like that. She explained things without making it weird. 

She’d let me copy her answers—but only after I tried to understand them first.

At lunch, she sat outside under the trees near the side parking lot. Alone at first. I started joining her, ditching my usual spot with the guys.

I soon found out why she kept to herself. It started small. A few whispers behind cupped hands, little laughs when Maya walked past in the hallway. She didn’t react at first, just rolled her eyes and kept walking. But I saw the tightness in her jaw. The way her grip on her backpack straps got a little firmer.

Then one day, someone didn’t bother whispering.

The comments started behind her back—“Isn’t she the one with the crackhead mom?”, “Heard she’s got, like, four half-siblings. All different dads.” 

I felt Maya tense beside me. Not flinch—just go still, like something inside her snapped into place. She didn’t say anything. Didn’t even look at them. She just turned and walked fast, then faster, then she was running down the hall.

“Yo,” I called after her, but she was already gone.
I spun back to the group gossiping. 

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I snapped. Heads turned. Good. 

One of the guys laughed. “Relax, man. It’s just facts.”

“Facts?” I stepped closer. “You don’t know shit about her.”

The girl rolled her eyes. “She’s gonna end up just like her mom anyway. Everyone knows that.”

“Oh fuck off!” I shouted. I didn’t wait. I took off after Maya.

I checked the bathroom first. Empty. Then the quad. Nothing. My last period bell rang, but I didn’t care. I headed to the library because it was the only quiet place left in this school.

She was tucked into the far back corner, half-hidden behind the tall shelves nobody ever went to. Sitting on the floor. Knees pulled in. Hoodie sleeve pushed up.

My stomach dropped.

“Maya,” I said, low. Careful.

She didn’t look up.

I took a few slow steps closer and saw it—the razor in her hand. 

Her arm was a roadmap of old lines. Some faded. Some not.

“Hey,” I said, softer now. “Don’t.”

Her hand paused.

“You’re not allowed to say that,” she muttered. Her voice was wrecked. “You don’t get to stop me.”

“I know,” I said. “But I’m asking anyway.”

She laughed once, sharp and ugly. “They’re right, you know. About me. About all of it.”

I crouched down in front of her, keeping my hands where she could see them. “They don’t know you.”

“They know enough,” she said. “My mom’s an addict. She disappears for days. Sometimes weeks. We all got different dads. None of them stuck. People hear that and they already got my ending figured out.”

“You’re not,” I said.

She lifted the razor slightly. “You don’t know that.”

She finally looked at me. Her blue eyes were red, furious, tired. “You think I don’t see it? I’m already halfway there.”

I swallowed. “I know what it’s like when everyone assumes you’re trash because of who raised you.”
That got her attention.

“My dad’s been locked up most of my life,” I said. “I’ve got scars too.” I tapped my knuckles. Old marks. “From standing up to him when I shouldn’t have. From thinking I could fix things if I just tried harder.”
She stared at my hands like she was seeing them for the first time.

“I used to think if I didn’t fight back, I’d turn into him,” I went on. “Turns out, fighting him didn’t make me better either. Just made everything louder.”

Her grip on the razor loosened a little.

I reached out slowly. “Can you give me that?”

She hesitated. Long enough that my heart was pounding in my ears. Then she dropped the razor into my palm like it weighed a thousand pounds.

She covered her face and finally broke.

I stayed there. Didn’t try to fix it. Didn’t say the wrong hopeful crap. Just sat on the library floor with her while she cried it out.

—
​​That night, I knocked on Maya’s door after everyone had crashed.

“I have an idea,” I whispered. “It’s mean though…”
Maya smirked. “The meaner the better.”

That morning, we showed up to school early. We had backpacks full of supplies—a screwdriver, glitter, expired sardines, and four tiny tubes of industrial-strength superglue.

We snuck into the locker hallway when the janitor went for his smoke break. Maya kept lookout while I unscrewed the hinges on three locker doors—each one belonging to the worst of the trash-talkers. We laced the inside edges with glue, so when they slammed shut like usual, they’d stay that way. 

Inside one of them, we left a glitter bomb rigged to pop the second the door opened. In another, Maya stuffed the expired sardines into a pencil pouch and superglued that shut too. The smell would hit like a punch in the face.

We barely made it to homeroom before the chaos started.

First period: screaming from the hallway. Second period: a janitor with bolt cutters. By third period, the whole school was buzzing.

And then we got called to the office.

We got caught on cameras. Of course. We didn’t even try to lie. Just sat there while the vice principal read us the suspension notice like he was personally offended.

“Three days. Home. No extracurriculars. You’re lucky we’re not calling the police.”

Outside the office, Maya bumped my shoulder. “Worth it?”

I grinned. “Every second.”

—

I got my permit that November. Mom let me borrow the car sometimes, mostly because she was too tired to argue. We made it count—gas station dinners, thrift store photo shoots, late-night drives to nowhere.

We’d sneak out some nights just to lie in the truck bed and stare at the stars through the trees, counting satellites and pretending they were escape pods.

The first time she kissed me, it wasn’t planned. We were sitting in the school parking lot, waiting for the rain to let up. She just looked over and said, “I’m gonna do something stupid,” then leaned in before I could ask what. After that, it all moved fast.

The first time we had sex was in the back of the car, parked on an old forestry road, all fumbling hands and held breath. We thought we were careful.

The scare happened two weeks later. A late period, a pregnancy test from the pharmacy. The longest three minutes of our lives, standing in that cabin’s moldy bathroom, waiting. When it was negative, we didn’t celebrate. She laughed. I almost cried.

After that, we thought more about the future. Maya started talking about college more. Somewhere far. I didn’t have plans like that, but I was working weekends at the pizza shop, and started saving. Not for clothes or games—just for getting out. 

—

By December, things settled down a bit. We tried to make the best of the holidays. All month, the cabin smelled like pine and mildew and cheap cinnamon candles. We’d managed to scrape together some decorations—paper snowflakes, a string of busted lights that only half worked, and a sad fake tree we found at the thrift store for five bucks. Nico hung plastic ornaments like it was the real deal. Kiana made hot cocoa from a dollar store mix and forced everyone to drink it. Mom even smiled a few times, though it never lasted.

Maya and I did our part. Helped the little kids wrap presents in newspaper. Made jokes about how Santa probably skipped our cabin because the GPS gave up halfway up the mountain. 

Even Tasha seemed mellow for once.

But then Christmas Eve hit. 

Maya’s mom announced that afternoon she was inviting her new boyfriend over for dinner. Some dude named Rick or Rich or something. Maya went quiet first, then full-on exploded.

“You’re kidding, right?” she snapped. “You’re really bringing some random guy here? On Christmas Eve?”

Tasha shrugged like it was no big deal. “He’s not random. I’ve known him for months.”

“And that makes it fucking okay? And now we’re supposed to play happy family?”

“Watch your mouth.”

“Or what? You’ll vanish for a week and pretend this never happened?”

Tasha lit a cigarette inside the house, which she only did when she was mad. “It’s my house, Maya. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”

Maya laughed. “Gladly.”

She grabbed her bag and was out the door before I could say anything. I followed.

We sat on the steps while the cold settled into our bones. She didn’t talk. Just stared out at the trees, fists clenched in her lap like she was holding herself together by force. I leaned over, bumped her shoulder.

“Let’s bounce.”

She looked at me. “Where?""

“Anywhere but here.”

So we sneaked out. I borrowed Mom’s car.

We drove up to a dirt road, way up past the ranger station, where the trees cleared and gave you this wide, unreal view of the valley below. You could see for miles.

I popped the trunk, and we sat with our legs hanging out the back, wrapped in a blanket. I pulled out the six-pack I’d stashed—some knockoff lager from that corner store near school that never asked questions. Maya lit a joint she’d swiped from her mom’s stash and passed it to me without saying anything.

We just sat there, knees touching, sipping beer and smoking the joint, watching our breath cloud up in the freezing air. Maya played music off her phone, low. Some old indie Christmas playlist she’d downloaded for the irony.

At one point, she leaned her head on my shoulder.

“Thanks,” she whispered.

“For what?”

“For giving me something that doesn’t suck.”

—

Maya was humming some half-forgotten carol when I noticed it—this streak of light cutting across the night sky, low and fast. At first I thought it was just a shooting star, but it didn’t fizzle out like it was supposed to. It curved. Like it was changing direction. Like it knew where it was going.

“Did you see that?” I asked.

She lifted her head. “What?”

I pointed. “That...”

Maya squinted. “What am I supposed to be looking at?”
I fumbled the binoculars from the glovebox—old ones my uncle gave me for spotting deer. I raised them to my eyes.

I held them up so that Maya could see too, adjusted the focus, and froze.

Maya noticed right away. “What? What is it?”

Through the binoculars, there were figures—too many to count, all of them fast. Not like planes. More like shadows ripping across the sky, riding... something. Horses, maybe. Or things shaped like horses but wrong. Twisted. And riders—tall, thin figures wrapped in cloaks that whipped in the wind, some with skull faces, some with no faces at all. Weapons glinted in their hands. Swords. Spears. Chains.

“Oh. No,” Maya whispered. 

“What is it?” I asked.

She looked at me. “It’s heading towards the cabin.”

I snatched the binoculars back, my hands shaking so hard the image blurred. It took me three tries to steady them against my face.

She was right.

The things weren’t just in the sky anymore. They were descending, a dark wave pouring down the tree line toward the base of the mountain. Toward our road. Toward the cabin.

“We have to go. Now.” 

We scrambled into the car. I spun the tires in the dirt, wrenching the wheel toward home. The headlights carved a shaky path through the dark as we flew down the mountain road, branches slapping the windshield.
“Call my mom,” I told Maya, handing my phone to her. 
“Put it on speaker.”
The ringing seemed to last forever. Mom picked up.

“Roen? Where are you? Where’s the car?” The anger was a live wire.

“Mom, listen! You have to get everyone inside. Lock the doors. Right now.”

“What are you talking about? Are you in trouble?”

“Mom, no! Listen! There’s something coming. From the sky. We saw it. It’s coming down the mountain toward the cabin.”

A beat of dead silence. Then her tone, cold and disbelieving. “Have you been doing drugs? Is Maya with you?”

“Mom, I swear to God, I’m… Please, just look outside. Go to a window and look up toward the ridge.”

“I’m looking, Roen. I don’t see anything but trees and…” She trailed off. I heard a faint, distant sound through the phone, like bells, but twisted and metallic. “What is that noise?”

Then, Nico’s voice, excited in the background. “Mom! Mom! Look! It’s Santa’s sleigh! I see the lights!”

Kiana joined in. “Whoa! Are those reindeer?”

“Kids, get back from the window,” Mom said, but her voice had changed. The anger was gone, replaced by a slow-dawning confusion. The bells were louder now, mixed with a sound like wind tearing through a canyon.

“Mom, it’s NOT Santa!” I was yelling, my foot pressing the accelerator to the floor. The car fishtailed on a gravel curve. “Get everyone and run into the woods! Now!”

The line went quiet for one second too long. Not dead quiet—I could hear the muffled rustle of the phone in my mom’s hand, a sharp intake of breath.

Then the sounds started.

Not bells anymore. Something lower, a grinding hum that vibrated through the phone speaker. It was followed by a skittering, scraping noise, like claws on slate, getting closer. Fast.

“Marisol?” Tasha’s voice, distant and confused. “Is something on the roof?”

A thud shook the line, so heavy it made my mom gasp. Then a shriek—not human, something high and chittering.

A window shattered. A massive, bursting crunch, like something had come straight through the wall.

Then the screams started.

Not just screams of fear. These were sounds of pure, physical terror. Kiana’s high-pitched shriek cut off into a gurgle. Nico wailed, “Mommy!” before his voice was swallowed by a thick, wet thud and a crash of furniture.

“NO! GET AWAY FROM THEM!” My mom’s voice was raw, a warrior’s cry. I heard a grunt of effort, the smash of something heavy—maybe a lamp, a chair—connecting, followed by a hiss that was absolutely not human.

Tasha was cursing, a stream of furious, slurred shouts. There was a scuffle, then a body hitting the floor.

“ROEN!” My mom screamed my name into the phone. It was the last clear word.

A final, piercing shriek was cut short. Then a heavy, dragging sound. 

The line hissed with empty static for three heartbeats.

Then it went dead.

The car tore around the last bend. The cabin came into view, every window blazing with light. The front door was gone. Just a dark, open hole.

I slammed on the brakes, the car skidding to a stop fifty yards away.

The car was still ticking when I killed the engine. 
Maya grabbed my arm. “Roen. Don’t.”

I pulled free. My legs felt numb, like they didn’t belong to me anymore, but they still moved. Every step toward the house felt wrong, like I was walking into a memory that hadn’t happened yet.

The ground between us and the cabin was torn up—deep gouges in the dirt, snapped branches, something dragged straight through the yard. The porch was half gone. The roof sagged in the middle like it had been stepped on.

We desperately called our family’s names. But some part of me already knew no one would answer.
The inside smelled wrong. Something metallic and burnt.

The living room barely looked like a room anymore. Furniture smashed flat. Walls cracked. Blood everywhere—smeared, sprayed, soaked into the carpet so dark it almost looked black. Bodies were scattered where people had been standing or running.

Jay was closest to the door. Or what was left of him. His body lay twisted at an angle that didn’t make sense, like he’d been thrown. 

Bri was near the hallway. She was facedown, drowned in her own blood. One arm stretched out like she’d been reaching for someone. Malik was farther back, slumped against the wall, eyes open but empty, throat cut clean. 

Tasha was near the kitchen. Or what was left of her. Her torso was slashed open, ribs visible through torn fabric. Her head was missing. One hand was clenched around a broken bottle, like she’d tried to fight back even when it was already over.

Maya dropped to her knees.

“No, mommy, no…” she said. Over and over. 

I kept moving because if I stopped, I wasn’t sure I’d start again.

My hands were shaking so bad I had to press them into my jeans to steady myself.

“Mom,” I called out, even though I already knew.

The back room was crushed inward like something heavy had landed there.

Mom was on the floor. I knew it was her because she was curled around a smaller body.

Kiana was inside her arms, turned into my mom’s chest. Her head was gone. Just a ragged stump at her neck, soaked dark. My mom’s face was frozen mid-scream, eyes wide, mouth open, teeth bared.

I couldn’t breathe. My chest locked up, and for a second I thought I might pass out standing there.
I dropped to my knees anyway.

“I’m sorry,” I said. To both of them. To all of them. Like it might still matter.

Then, something moved.

Not the house settling. Not the wind. This was close. Wet. Fast.

I snapped my head toward the hallway and backed up on instinct, almost slipping in blood. My heart was hammering so hard it felt like it was shaking my teeth loose.

“Maya,” I said, low and sharp. “Get up. Something’s still here.”

She sucked in a breath like she’d been punched and scrambled to her feet, eyes wild. I looked around for anything that wasn’t broken or nailed down.

That’s when I saw my mom’s hand.

Tucked against her wrist, half-hidden by her sleeve, was a revolver. The snub‑nose she kept buried in the back of the closet “just in case.” I’d seen it once, years ago, when she thought my dad was coming back drunk and angry.

I knelt and pried it free, gently, like she might still feel it.

The gun was warm.

I flipped the cylinder open with shaking fingers. Five loaded chambers. One spent casing.

“She got a shot off,” I whispered. 

Maya was already moving. She grabbed a bat leaning against the wall near the tree—aluminum, cheap, still wrapped with a torn bow. Jay’s Christmas present. She peeled the plastic off and took a stance like she’d done this before.

The thing scuttled out of the hallway on all fours, moving with a broken, jerky grace. It was all wrong—a patchwork of fur and leathery skin, twisted horns, and eyes that burned like wet matches. It was big, shoulders hunched low to clear the ceiling. And on its flank, a raw, blackened crater wept thick, tar-like blood. My mom’s shot.

Our eyes met. Its jaws unhinged with a sound like cracking ice.

It charged.

I didn’t think. I raised the revolver and pulled the trigger. The first blast was deafening in the shattered room. It hit the thing in the chest, barely slowing it. I fired again. And again. The shots were too fast, my aim wild. I saw chunks of it jerk away. One shot took a piece of its ear. Another sparked off a horn.
It was on me.

The smell hit—old blood and wet earth. A claw swiped, ripping my jacket.

That’s when the bat connected.

Maya swung from the side with everything she had. The aluminum thwanged against its knee. Something cracked. The creature buckled. She swung again, a two-handed blow to its ribs. Another sickening crunch.

The creature turned on her, giving me its side. I jammed the barrel of the pistol into its ribcase and fired the last round point-blank. The thing let out a shriek of pure agony.

The creature reeled back, a spray of dark fluid gushing from the new hole in its side. It hissed, legs buckling beneath it. It took a step forward and collapsed hard, one hand clawing at the floor like it still wanted to fight. 

I stood there with the revolver hanging useless in my hand, ears ringing, lungs barely working. My jacket, my hands, my face—everything was slick with its blood. Thick, black, warm. It dripped off my fingers and splattered onto the wrecked floor like oil.

I couldn’t move. My brain felt unplugged. Like if I stayed perfectly still, none of this would be real.

“Roen.” Maya’s voice sounded far away. Then closer. “Roen—look at me.”

I didn’t.

She grabbed my wrists hard. Her hands were shaking worse than mine. “Hey. Hey. We have to go. Right now.”

I blinked. My eyes burned. “My mom… Kiana…”

“I know, babe,” she said, voice cracking but steady anyway. “But we can’t stay here.”

Something deep in me fought that. Screamed at me to stay. To do something. To not leave them like this. 

Maya tugged me toward the door. I let her.

We stumbled out into the cold night, slipping in the torn-up dirt. The air hit my face and I sucked it in like I’d been underwater too long. The sky above the cabin was alive.

Shapes moved across it—dark figures lifting off from the ground, rising in spirals and lines, mounting beasts that shouldn’t exist. Antlers. Wings. Too many legs. Too many eyes. The sound came back, clearer now: bells, laughter, howling wind.

They rose over the treeline in a long, crooked procession, silhouettes cutting across the moon. And at the front of it—
I stopped dead.

The sleigh floated higher than the rest, massive and ornate, pulled by creatures that looked like reindeer only in the loosest sense. Their bodies were stretched wrong, ribs showing through skin, eyes glowing like coals.

At the reins stood him.

Tall. Broad. Wrapped in red that looked stained in blood. His beard hung in clumps, matted and dark. His smile was too wide, teeth too many. A crown of antlers rose from his head, tangled with bells that rang wrong—deep, warped.

He reached down into the sleigh, grabbed something that kicked and screamed, and hauled it up by the arm.

Nico.

My brother thrashed, crying, his small hands clawing at the edge of the sleigh. I saw his face clearly in the firelight—terror, confusion, mouth open as he screamed my name.

“NO!” I tried to run. Maya wrapped her arms around my chest and hauled me back with everything she had.

The figure laughed. A deep, booming sound that echoed through the trees and into my bones. He shoved Nico headfirst into a bulging sack already writhing with movement—other kids, other screams—then tied it shut like it was nothing.

The sleigh lurched forward.The procession surged after it, riders whooping and shrieking as they climbed into the sky. 

Something dragged itself out of the cabin behind us.

The wounded creature. The one we thought was dead.

It staggered on three limbs, leaving a thick trail of blood across the porch and into the dirt. It let out a broken, furious cry and launched itself forward as the sleigh passed overhead.

Its claws caught the back rail of the sleigh. It slammed into the side hard, dangling there, legs kicking uselessly as the procession carried it upward. Blood sprayed out behind it in a long, dark arc, raining down through the trees.

For a few seconds, it hung on. Dragged. Refused to let go.
Then its grip failed.

The creature fell.

It vanished into the forest below with a distant, wet crash that echoed once and then went silent.

The sleigh didn’t slow.

The Santa thing threw his head back and laughed again, louder this time, like the sound itself was a victory. Then the hunt disappeared into the clouds, the bells fading until there was nothing left but wind and ruined trees and the broken shell of the cabin behind us.

—

We just sat down in the dirt a few yards from the cabin and held onto each other like if we let go, one of us would disappear too.

I don’t know how long it was. Long enough for the cold to stop mattering. Long enough for my hands to go numb around Maya’s jacket. Long enough for my brain to start doing this stupid thing where it kept trying to rewind, like maybe I’d missed a moment where I could’ve done something different.

It was Maya who finally remembered the phone.

“Roen,” she said, voice hoarse. “We have to call the police….”

My hands shook so bad I dropped my phone twice before I managed to unlock the screen. There was dried blood in the cracks of the case. I dialed 911 and put it on speaker because I didn’t trust myself to hold it.

The dispatcher’s voice was calm. Too calm.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

—

The cops showed up fast. Faster than I expected. Two cruisers at first, then more. Red and blue lights flooded the trees like some messed-up holiday display.

They separated us immediately.

Hands up. On your knees. Don’t move.

I remember one of them staring at my jacket, at the black blood smeared down my arms, and his hand never left his gun.

They asked us what happened. Over and over. Separately. Same questions, different words.

I told them there were things in the house. I told them they killed everyone. I told them they weren't human.

That was the exact moment their faces changed.

Not fear. Not concern.

Suspicion.

They cuffed my hands. Maya’s too. 

At first, they tried to pin it on me. Or maybe both of us. Kept pressing like we were hiding something, like maybe there was a fight that got out of hand, or we snapped, or it was drugs. Asked where I dumped Nico’s body.

One of the detectives took the revolver out of an evidence bag and set it on the table of the interrogation room like it was a point he’d been waiting to make.

“So you fired this?”

“Yes,” I said. “At the thing.”

“What thing?”

I looked at him. “The thing that killed my family.”

He wrote something down and nodded like that explained everything.

When the forensics team finally showed up and started putting the scene together, it got harder to make it stick. The blood patterns, the way the bodies were torn apart—none of it made sense for a standard attack. Way too violent. Way too messy. Too many injuries that didn’t line up with the weapons they found. No human did that. No animal either, far as they could tell. But they sure as hell weren’t going to write “mythical sky monsters” in the report.

Next theory? My dad.

But he was still locked up. Solid alibi. The detectives even visited him in prison to personally make sure he was still there. 
After that, they looked at Rick. Tasha’s boyfriend. Only problem? They found him too. What was left of him, anyway. His body was found near the front yard, slumped against a tree. Neck snapped like a twig.

That’s when they got quiet. No more hard questions. Just forms. Statements. A counselor.

We were minors. No surviving family. That part was simple.
Child Protect Services got involved.

They wanted to split us up. Said it was temporary, just until they could sort everything out. I got assigned a group home in Clovis. Maya got somewhere in Madera.

—

The day they told me I was getting moved, I didn’t even argue. There wasn’t any fight left. Just this empty numbness that settled behind my ribs and stayed there. The caseworker—Janine or Jenna or something—told me the social worker wanted to talk before the transfer. I figured it was some last-minute paperwork thing.

Instead, they walked me into this windowless office and shut the door behind me.

Maya was already there.

She looked as rough as I felt—pale, shadows under her baby-blue eyes. When she saw me, she blinked like she wasn’t sure I was real. We just stood there for a second.

Then she crossed the room and hugged me so hard it hurt.
I held on. Didn’t say anything. Couldn’t.

“Hey,” she said into my shoulder. Her voice shook once. “Hey,” I replied.

“I thought they sent you away already,” I said.

“Almost,” she said. “Guess we got a delay.”

We pulled apart when someone cleared their throat.

I looked up to see a woman already in the room, standing near the wall.

She was in her late thirties, maybe. She didn’t look like a social worker I’d ever seen. Didn’t smell like stale coffee or exhaustion. Black blazer and jeans. Her dark brown hair was cropped short and neat. Her hazel eyes were sharp, measuring, like she was sizing up threats.

She closed the door behind her.

“I’m glad you two got a moment to catch up,” she said calmly. “Please, sit.”

“My name is Agent Sara Benoit,” she said.

The woman waited until we were seated before she spoke again. She didn’t rush it. Let the silence stretch just long enough to feel intentional.

“I know you’ve already talked to the police,” she said. “Multiple times.”

I let out a short, tired laugh. “Then why are we here again?”
She looked at me directly. Not through me. Not like I was a problem to solve. “Because I’m not with the police.”

Maya stiffened beside me. I felt it through her sleeve.

I said, “So what? You’re a shrink? This is where you tell us we’re crazy, right?”

Benoit shook her head. “No. This is where I tell you I believe you.”

That landed heavier than any I’d heard so far.

I stared at her. “You… what?”

“I believe there was something non-human involved in the killings at that cabin,” she said. Flat. Like she was reading off a weather report. “I believe what you saw in the sky was real. And I believe the entity you described—what the media will eventually call an animal or a cult or a psychotic break—is none of those things.”

The room was quiet except for the hum of the lights.

Maya spoke up. “They said we were traumatized. That our minds filled in the gaps.”

Benoit nodded. “That’s what they have to say. It keeps things neat.”

That pissed me off more than anything else she could’ve said.

“Neat? I saw my family slaughtered,” I said. My voice stayed level, but it took work. “I watched something dressed like evil Santa kidnap my brother . If you’re about to tell me to move on, don’t.”

Benoit didn’t flinch.

“I’m not here to tell you that,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that what took your brother isn’t untouchable. And what killed your family doesn’t get to walk away clean.”

My chest tightened. Maya’s fingers found mine under the table and locked on.

I shook my head. “The fuck can you do about it? What are you? FBI? CIA? Some Men in Black knockoff with worse suits?”

She smirked at my jab, then reached into her blazer slowly, deliberately, like she didn’t want us to think she was pulling a weapon. She flipped open a leather badge wallet and slid it across the table.

‘NORAD
 Special Investigations Division’

The seal was real. The badge was heavy. Government ugly. No flair.

“…NORAD?” I said. “What’s that?”

“North American Aerospace Defense Command,” she explained. “Officially, we track airspace. Missiles. Unidentified aircraft. Anything that crosses borders where it shouldn’t.”

“What the hell does fucking NORAD want with us?” I demanded.

Benoit didn’t flinch. She just stated, “I’m here to offer you a choice.”

“A choice?” Maya asked.

She nodded. “Option one: you go to group homes, therapy, court dates. You try to live with what you saw. The official story will be ‘unknown assailants’ and ‘tragic circumstances.’ Your brother will be listed as deceased once the paperwork catches up.”

My chest burned. “And the other option?”

“Option two,” she said, her voice low and steady, “you come with me. You disappear on paper. New names, new files. You train with us. You learn what these things are, and how to kill them. Then you find the ones who did this. You get your brother back, and you make them pay.”",2,1765844807.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

I'm Going to Get Him Back (Part 1),"When dad got locked up again, it didn’t hit right away. He’d been in and out since I was nine, but this time felt different. Longer sentence. Something about assault with a weapon and parole violations. My mom, Marisol, cried once, then shut down completely. No yelling, no last minute plea to judge for leniency—just silence.

“He’s going away for at least fifteen years.”

It wasn’t news. We all knew. I’d heard her crying about it on the phone to my grandma in the Philippines through the paper-thin wall. My little sister, Kiana heard it too but didn’t say anything. Just curled up on the mattress with his headphones on, pretending she couldn’t. 

Then mom couldn’t make rent. The landlord came by with that fake sympathy, like he felt bad but not bad enough to wait one more week for rent before evicting us. 

Our house in Fresno was one of those old stucco duplexes with mold in the vents and a broken front fence. Still, it was home. 

“We’ll get a fresh start,” Mom said.

And by “fresh start,” she meant a cabin in the Sierra Nevada that looked cheap even in blurry online photos. The only reason it was so affordable was because another family—who was somehow even worse off than we were—was willing to split the cost. We’d “make it work.” Whatever that meant.

I packed my clothes in trash bags. My baby brother, Nico, clutched his PS4 the whole time like someone was gonna steal it. Mom sold the washer and our living room couch for gas money.

When we finally pulled up, the place wasn’t a cabin so much as a box with windows. The woods pressed tight around it like the trees wanted to swallow it whole.

“Looks haunted,” I muttered, stepping out of the car and staring at the place. It had a sagging roof, moss creeping up one side, and a screen door that hung off one hinge like it gave up trying years ago.

Nico’s face scrunched up. “Haunted? For real?”

I shrugged. “Guess we’ll find out tonight.”

“We will?” He whispers.

Mom shot me that look. “Seriously, Roen?” she snapped. “You think this is funny? No, baby, it’s not haunted.” She reassured Nico.

I swung one of the trash bags over my shoulder and headed for the front door. The steps creaked loud under my feet, like even they weren’t sure they could hold me. Just as I reached for the knob—
I heard voices. Two people inside, arguing loud enough that I didn’t need to strain to catch it.

“I’m not sharing a room with some random people, Mom!” Said a girl’s voice. 

A second voice fired back, older, calmer but tight with frustration. “Maya, we’ve been over this. We don’t have a choice.”

Then I heard footsteps—fast ones, heavy and pissed off, thudding through the cabin toward the door.

Before I could move out of the way or even say anything, the front door flung open hard—right into me. The edge caught me square in the shoulder and chest, knocking the air out of me as I stumbled backward and landed flat on the porch with a loud thump.

“Shit,” I muttered, wincing.

A shadow filled the doorway. I looked up and there she was—the girl, standing over me with wide eyes and a face full of panic.

“Oh my god—I didn’t see you,” she said, breathless. “Are you okay? I didn’t—God, I’m sorry.”

She knelt down a little, hand halfway out like she wasn’t sure if she should help me up or if she’d already done enough damage.

I sat up, rubbing my ribs and trying not to look like it actually hurt as bad as it did. “Yeah,” I grunted. “I mean, it’s just a screen door. Not like it was made of steel or anything.”

I grabbed her outstretched hand. Her grip was stronger than I expected, but her fingers trembled a little.

She looked about my age—sixteen, maybe seventeen—with this messy blonde braid half falling apart and a hoodie that looked like it had been through a few too many wash cycles. Her nails were painted black, chipped down to the corners. She didn’t let go of my hand right away.

Her face changed fast. Like something hot in her just shut off the second our eyes locked. The sharp edge drained out of her expression, like she forgot what she was mad about.

“I didn’t know anyone was standing out here,” she said again, softer this time. “I just... needed air.”

“It’s all good,” I said, brushing dirt off my jeans and trying to gather my spilled stuff. “Not my first time getting knocked down today.”

She glanced awkwardly back inside. “So... guess that means you’re the people we’re sharing this dump with?”

“Yup. The other half of the broke brigade.”

She held out her hand. “I’m Maya.”

I took it. “Roen.”

“Let me guess…say you’re here because of someone else’s screw-up.”

“How’s you know?” I asked surprised.

She shrugged. “Let’s just say you’re not the only one.” 

Behind me, Nico whispered, “Is she a ghost?”

Maya raised an eyebrow. “Who's that?”

“My brother. He’s eight. He’s gonna ask a million questions, so get ready.”

She smirked. “Bring it on. I’ve survived worse.”
I believed her.

Kiana was already climbing out of the car, dragging her own trash bag behind her, when she caught sight of me and Maya still talking.

“Ohhh,” she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, drawing out the sound with a stupid grin. “Roen’s already got a girlfriend in the woods.”

I rolled my eyes. “Shut up, Kiana.”

Maya snorted but didn’t say anything, just crossed her arms and waited like she was curious how this was gonna play out.

“I’m just saying,” she whispered, “you’ve known her for like two minutes and you’re already helping each other off the porch like it’s a rom-com.”

“You’re not even supposed to know what that is.”
“I’m twelve, not dumb.”

“She’s cute,” Kiana added, smirking now as she walked past. “Y’all gonna braid each other’s hair later?”

“I swear to god—”

“Language,” Mom chided from behind me. 

Before I could fire back, the front door creaked open again, and a woman stepped out. Thin, wiry frame. She wore a faded flannel and sweatpants like she’d stopped trying to impress anyone years ago. Her eyes darted across us—counting, maybe—and her smile didn’t quite reach all the way up.

“You must be the Mayumis,” she said. Her voice was raspy, probably from too many cigarettes or too many bad nights. Maybe both. “I’m Tasha. Tasha Foster.”

She stepped closer, and the smell hit me—sharp and bitter. Whiskey. 

Mom appeared behind us just in time. “Hi, I’m Marisol,” she said quietly, arms crossed like she already regretted every decision that led us here.

They hugged briefly. More of a press of shoulders than a real embrace. Tasha nodded toward the cabin. “We’re tight on space, but we cleared out the back room. Me, you, and the girls can take that. The boys can have the den.”

“Boys?” I asked, stepping into the doorway and immediately getting swarmed by noise.

Inside, it looked like someone tried to clean but gave up halfway through. There were dishes drying on one side of the sink, and unfolded laundry piled on the couch. A crusty pizza box sat on the counter next to an open bottle of something that definitely wasn’t juice.

Then came the thundering feet—three of them. First was a chubby kid with wild curls and a superhero shirt that was two sizes too small. He stopped, blinked at us, then just yelled, “New people!”

A girl around Kiana’s age followed, hair in tight braids and a glare that said she didn’t trust any of us. Behind her was a tall, lanky boy with headphones around his neck and that look teens get when they’re stuck somewhere they hate.

Maya rolled her eyes. “These are my siblings. That loud one’s Jay, the girl with the death stare is Bri, and the quiet one’s Malik.”

Jay darted toward Nico immediately, pointing at the PS4. “You got games?!”

Nico lit up. “A bunch.”

Mom and Tasha slipped into the kitchen to talk in low voices while the rest of us stood there in this weird moment of strangers under one roof. 

Maya looked around at the chaos. “So… welcome to the party.”

“Some party,” I muttered, but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth.

Kiana elbowed me. “I like it here,” she said.

—

Starting a new school in the middle of the year is trash. No one tells you where anything is, teachers already have favorites, and everybody’s locked into their little cliques like they’re afraid being friendly’s contagious.

Maya and I ended up in the same homeroom, which helped. It was the only part of the day that didn’t feel like I was walking into someone else’s house uninvited. She sat two rows over at first, headphones in, scribbling in the margins of a beat-up copy of The Bell Jar. I didn’t even know she read stuff like that.

We got paired up in Physics too—lab partners. I’m more of the “just tell me what to do and I’ll do it” type when it comes to school. I play ball. Football mostly, but I’m decent at track. Maya actually liked the subject. Asked questions. Took notes like they meant something. The first week, I thought we’d hate working together—like she’d think I was an idiot or something—but it wasn’t like that. She explained things without making it weird. 

She’d let me copy her answers—but only after I tried to understand them first.

At lunch, she sat outside under the trees near the side parking lot. Alone at first. I started joining her, ditching my usual spot with the guys.

I soon found out why she kept to herself. It started small. A few whispers behind cupped hands, little laughs when Maya walked past in the hallway. She didn’t react at first, just rolled her eyes and kept walking. But I saw the tightness in her jaw. The way her grip on her backpack straps got a little firmer.

Then one day, someone didn’t bother whispering.

The comments started behind her back—“Isn’t she the one with the crackhead mom?”, “Heard she’s got, like, four half-siblings. All different dads.” 

I felt Maya tense beside me. Not flinch—just go still, like something inside her snapped into place. She didn’t say anything. Didn’t even look at them. She just turned and walked fast, then faster, then she was running down the hall.

“Yo,” I called after her, but she was already gone.
I spun back to the group gossiping. 

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I snapped. Heads turned. Good. 

One of the guys laughed. “Relax, man. It’s just facts.”

“Facts?” I stepped closer. “You don’t know shit about her.”

The girl rolled her eyes. “She’s gonna end up just like her mom anyway. Everyone knows that.”

“Oh fuck off!” I shouted. I didn’t wait. I took off after Maya.

I checked the bathroom first. Empty. Then the quad. Nothing. My last period bell rang, but I didn’t care. I headed to the library because it was the only quiet place left in this school.

She was tucked into the far back corner, half-hidden behind the tall shelves nobody ever went to. Sitting on the floor. Knees pulled in. Hoodie sleeve pushed up.

My stomach dropped.

“Maya,” I said, low. Careful.

She didn’t look up.

I took a few slow steps closer and saw it—the razor in her hand. 

Her arm was a roadmap of old lines. Some faded. Some not.

“Hey,” I said, softer now. “Don’t.”

Her hand paused.

“You’re not allowed to say that,” she muttered. Her voice was wrecked. “You don’t get to stop me.”

“I know,” I said. “But I’m asking anyway.”

She laughed once, sharp and ugly. “They’re right, you know. About me. About all of it.”

I crouched down in front of her, keeping my hands where she could see them. “They don’t know you.”

“They know enough,” she said. “My mom’s an addict. She disappears for days. Sometimes weeks. We all got different dads. None of them stuck. People hear that and they already got my ending figured out.”

“You’re not,” I said.

She lifted the razor slightly. “You don’t know that.”

She finally looked at me. Her blue eyes were red, furious, tired. “You think I don’t see it? I’m already halfway there.”

I swallowed. “I know what it’s like when everyone assumes you’re trash because of who raised you.”
That got her attention.

“My dad’s been locked up most of my life,” I said. “I’ve got scars too.” I tapped my knuckles. Old marks. “From standing up to him when I shouldn’t have. From thinking I could fix things if I just tried harder.”
She stared at my hands like she was seeing them for the first time.

“I used to think if I didn’t fight back, I’d turn into him,” I went on. “Turns out, fighting him didn’t make me better either. Just made everything louder.”

Her grip on the razor loosened a little.

I reached out slowly. “Can you give me that?”

She hesitated. Long enough that my heart was pounding in my ears. Then she dropped the razor into my palm like it weighed a thousand pounds.

She covered her face and finally broke.

I stayed there. Didn’t try to fix it. Didn’t say the wrong hopeful crap. Just sat on the library floor with her while she cried it out.

—
​​That night, I knocked on Maya’s door after everyone had crashed.

“I have an idea,” I whispered. “It’s mean though…”
Maya smirked. “The meaner the better.”

That morning, we showed up to school early. We had backpacks full of supplies—a screwdriver, glitter, expired sardines, and four tiny tubes of industrial-strength superglue.

We snuck into the locker hallway when the janitor went for his smoke break. Maya kept lookout while I unscrewed the hinges on three locker doors—each one belonging to the worst of the trash-talkers. We laced the inside edges with glue, so when they slammed shut like usual, they’d stay that way. 

Inside one of them, we left a glitter bomb rigged to pop the second the door opened. In another, Maya stuffed the expired sardines into a pencil pouch and superglued that shut too. The smell would hit like a punch in the face.

We barely made it to homeroom before the chaos started.

First period: screaming from the hallway. Second period: a janitor with bolt cutters. By third period, the whole school was buzzing.

And then we got called to the office.

We got caught on cameras. Of course. We didn’t even try to lie. Just sat there while the vice principal read us the suspension notice like he was personally offended.

“Three days. Home. No extracurriculars. You’re lucky we’re not calling the police.”

Outside the office, Maya bumped my shoulder. “Worth it?”

I grinned. “Every second.”

—

I got my permit that November. Mom let me borrow the car sometimes, mostly because she was too tired to argue. We made it count—gas station dinners, thrift store photo shoots, late-night drives to nowhere.

We’d sneak out some nights just to lie in the truck bed and stare at the stars through the trees, counting satellites and pretending they were escape pods.

The first time she kissed me, it wasn’t planned. We were sitting in the school parking lot, waiting for the rain to let up. She just looked over and said, “I’m gonna do something stupid,” then leaned in before I could ask what. After that, it all moved fast.

The first time we had sex was in the back of the car, parked on an old forestry road, all fumbling hands and held breath. We thought we were careful.

The scare happened two weeks later. A late period, a pregnancy test from the pharmacy. The longest three minutes of our lives, standing in that cabin’s moldy bathroom, waiting. When it was negative, we didn’t celebrate. She laughed. I almost cried.

After that, we thought more about the future. Maya started talking about college more. Somewhere far. I didn’t have plans like that, but I was working weekends at the pizza shop, and started saving. Not for clothes or games—just for getting out. 

—

By December, things settled down a bit. We tried to make the best of the holidays. All month, the cabin smelled like pine and mildew and cheap cinnamon candles. We’d managed to scrape together some decorations—paper snowflakes, a string of busted lights that only half worked, and a sad fake tree we found at the thrift store for five bucks. Nico hung plastic ornaments like it was the real deal. Kiana made hot cocoa from a dollar store mix and forced everyone to drink it. Mom even smiled a few times, though it never lasted.

Maya and I did our part. Helped the little kids wrap presents in newspaper. Made jokes about how Santa probably skipped our cabin because the GPS gave up halfway up the mountain. 

Even Tasha seemed mellow for once.

But then Christmas Eve hit. 

Maya’s mom announced that afternoon she was inviting her new boyfriend over for dinner. Some dude named Rick or Rich or something. Maya went quiet first, then full-on exploded.

“You’re kidding, right?” she snapped. “You’re really bringing some random guy here? On Christmas Eve?”

Tasha shrugged like it was no big deal. “He’s not random. I’ve known him for months.”

“And that makes it fucking okay? And now we’re supposed to play happy family?”

“Watch your mouth.”

“Or what? You’ll vanish for a week and pretend this never happened?”

Tasha lit a cigarette inside the house, which she only did when she was mad. “It’s my house, Maya. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”

Maya laughed. “Gladly.”

She grabbed her bag and was out the door before I could say anything. I followed.

We sat on the steps while the cold settled into our bones. She didn’t talk. Just stared out at the trees, fists clenched in her lap like she was holding herself together by force. I leaned over, bumped her shoulder.

“Let’s bounce.”

She looked at me. “Where?""

“Anywhere but here.”

So we sneaked out. I borrowed Mom’s car.

We drove up to a dirt road, way up past the ranger station, where the trees cleared and gave you this wide, unreal view of the valley below. You could see for miles.

I popped the trunk, and we sat with our legs hanging out the back, wrapped in a blanket. I pulled out the six-pack I’d stashed—some knockoff lager from that corner store near school that never asked questions. Maya lit a joint she’d swiped from her mom’s stash and passed it to me without saying anything.

We just sat there, knees touching, sipping beer and smoking the joint, watching our breath cloud up in the freezing air. Maya played music off her phone, low. Some old indie Christmas playlist she’d downloaded for the irony.

At one point, she leaned her head on my shoulder.

“Thanks,” she whispered.

“For what?”

“For giving me something that doesn’t suck.”

—

Maya was humming some half-forgotten carol when I noticed it—this streak of light cutting across the night sky, low and fast. At first I thought it was just a shooting star, but it didn’t fizzle out like it was supposed to. It curved. Like it was changing direction. Like it knew where it was going.

“Did you see that?” I asked.

She lifted her head. “What?”

I pointed. “That...”

Maya squinted. “What am I supposed to be looking at?”
I fumbled the binoculars from the glovebox—old ones my uncle gave me for spotting deer. I raised them to my eyes.

I held them up so that Maya could see too, adjusted the focus, and froze.

Maya noticed right away. “What? What is it?”

Through the binoculars, there were figures—too many to count, all of them fast. Not like planes. More like shadows ripping across the sky, riding... something. Horses, maybe. Or things shaped like horses but wrong. Twisted. And riders—tall, thin figures wrapped in cloaks that whipped in the wind, some with skull faces, some with no faces at all. Weapons glinted in their hands. Swords. Spears. Chains.

“Oh. No,” Maya whispered. 

“What is it?” I asked.

She looked at me. “It’s heading towards the cabin.”

I snatched the binoculars back, my hands shaking so hard the image blurred. It took me three tries to steady them against my face.

She was right.

The things weren’t just in the sky anymore. They were descending, a dark wave pouring down the tree line toward the base of the mountain. Toward our road. Toward the cabin.

“We have to go. Now.” 

We scrambled into the car. I spun the tires in the dirt, wrenching the wheel toward home. The headlights carved a shaky path through the dark as we flew down the mountain road, branches slapping the windshield.
“Call my mom,” I told Maya, handing my phone to her. 
“Put it on speaker.”
The ringing seemed to last forever. Mom picked up.

“Roen? Where are you? Where’s the car?” The anger was a live wire.

“Mom, listen! You have to get everyone inside. Lock the doors. Right now.”

“What are you talking about? Are you in trouble?”

“Mom, no! Listen! There’s something coming. From the sky. We saw it. It’s coming down the mountain toward the cabin.”

A beat of dead silence. Then her tone, cold and disbelieving. “Have you been doing drugs? Is Maya with you?”

“Mom, I swear to God, I’m… Please, just look outside. Go to a window and look up toward the ridge.”

“I’m looking, Roen. I don’t see anything but trees and…” She trailed off. I heard a faint, distant sound through the phone, like bells, but twisted and metallic. “What is that noise?”

Then, Nico’s voice, excited in the background. “Mom! Mom! Look! It’s Santa’s sleigh! I see the lights!”

Kiana joined in. “Whoa! Are those reindeer?”

“Kids, get back from the window,” Mom said, but her voice had changed. The anger was gone, replaced by a slow-dawning confusion. The bells were louder now, mixed with a sound like wind tearing through a canyon.

“Mom, it’s NOT Santa!” I was yelling, my foot pressing the accelerator to the floor. The car fishtailed on a gravel curve. “Get everyone and run into the woods! Now!”

The line went quiet for one second too long. Not dead quiet—I could hear the muffled rustle of the phone in my mom’s hand, a sharp intake of breath.

Then the sounds started.

Not bells anymore. Something lower, a grinding hum that vibrated through the phone speaker. It was followed by a skittering, scraping noise, like claws on slate, getting closer. Fast.

“Marisol?” Tasha’s voice, distant and confused. “Is something on the roof?”

A thud shook the line, so heavy it made my mom gasp. Then a shriek—not human, something high and chittering.

A window shattered. A massive, bursting crunch, like something had come straight through the wall.

Then the screams started.

Not just screams of fear. These were sounds of pure, physical terror. Kiana’s high-pitched shriek cut off into a gurgle. Nico wailed, “Mommy!” before his voice was swallowed by a thick, wet thud and a crash of furniture.

“NO! GET AWAY FROM THEM!” My mom’s voice was raw, a warrior’s cry. I heard a grunt of effort, the smash of something heavy—maybe a lamp, a chair—connecting, followed by a hiss that was absolutely not human.

Tasha was cursing, a stream of furious, slurred shouts. There was a scuffle, then a body hitting the floor.

“ROEN!” My mom screamed my name into the phone. It was the last clear word.

A final, piercing shriek was cut short. Then a heavy, dragging sound. 

The line hissed with empty static for three heartbeats.

Then it went dead.

The car tore around the last bend. The cabin came into view, every window blazing with light. The front door was gone. Just a dark, open hole.

I slammed on the brakes, the car skidding to a stop fifty yards away.

The car was still ticking when I killed the engine. 
Maya grabbed my arm. “Roen. Don’t.”

I pulled free. My legs felt numb, like they didn’t belong to me anymore, but they still moved. Every step toward the house felt wrong, like I was walking into a memory that hadn’t happened yet.

The ground between us and the cabin was torn up—deep gouges in the dirt, snapped branches, something dragged straight through the yard. The porch was half gone. The roof sagged in the middle like it had been stepped on.

We desperately called our family’s names. But some part of me already knew no one would answer.
The inside smelled wrong. Something metallic and burnt.

The living room barely looked like a room anymore. Furniture smashed flat. Walls cracked. Blood everywhere—smeared, sprayed, soaked into the carpet so dark it almost looked black. Bodies were scattered where people had been standing or running.

Jay was closest to the door. Or what was left of him. His body lay twisted at an angle that didn’t make sense, like he’d been thrown. 

Bri was near the hallway. She was facedown, drowned in her own blood. One arm stretched out like she’d been reaching for someone. Malik was farther back, slumped against the wall, eyes open but empty, throat cut clean. 

Tasha was near the kitchen. Or what was left of her. Her torso was slashed open, ribs visible through torn fabric. Her head was missing. One hand was clenched around a broken bottle, like she’d tried to fight back even when it was already over.

Maya dropped to her knees.

“No, mommy, no…” she said. Over and over. 

I kept moving because if I stopped, I wasn’t sure I’d start again.

My hands were shaking so bad I had to press them into my jeans to steady myself.

“Mom,” I called out, even though I already knew.

The back room was crushed inward like something heavy had landed there.

Mom was on the floor. I knew it was her because she was curled around a smaller body.

Kiana was inside her arms, turned into my mom’s chest. Her head was gone. Just a ragged stump at her neck, soaked dark. My mom’s face was frozen mid-scream, eyes wide, mouth open, teeth bared.

I couldn’t breathe. My chest locked up, and for a second I thought I might pass out standing there.
I dropped to my knees anyway.

“I’m sorry,” I said. To both of them. To all of them. Like it might still matter.

Then, something moved.

Not the house settling. Not the wind. This was close. Wet. Fast.

I snapped my head toward the hallway and backed up on instinct, almost slipping in blood. My heart was hammering so hard it felt like it was shaking my teeth loose.

“Maya,” I said, low and sharp. “Get up. Something’s still here.”

She sucked in a breath like she’d been punched and scrambled to her feet, eyes wild. I looked around for anything that wasn’t broken or nailed down.

That’s when I saw my mom’s hand.

Tucked against her wrist, half-hidden by her sleeve, was a revolver. The snub‑nose she kept buried in the back of the closet “just in case.” I’d seen it once, years ago, when she thought my dad was coming back drunk and angry.

I knelt and pried it free, gently, like she might still feel it.

The gun was warm.

I flipped the cylinder open with shaking fingers. Five loaded chambers. One spent casing.

“She got a shot off,” I whispered. 

Maya was already moving. She grabbed a bat leaning against the wall near the tree—aluminum, cheap, still wrapped with a torn bow. Jay’s Christmas present. She peeled the plastic off and took a stance like she’d done this before.

The thing scuttled out of the hallway on all fours, moving with a broken, jerky grace. It was all wrong—a patchwork of fur and leathery skin, twisted horns, and eyes that burned like wet matches. It was big, shoulders hunched low to clear the ceiling. And on its flank, a raw, blackened crater wept thick, tar-like blood. My mom’s shot.

Our eyes met. Its jaws unhinged with a sound like cracking ice.

It charged.

I didn’t think. I raised the revolver and pulled the trigger. The first blast was deafening in the shattered room. It hit the thing in the chest, barely slowing it. I fired again. And again. The shots were too fast, my aim wild. I saw chunks of it jerk away. One shot took a piece of its ear. Another sparked off a horn.
It was on me.

The smell hit—old blood and wet earth. A claw swiped, ripping my jacket.

That’s when the bat connected.

Maya swung from the side with everything she had. The aluminum thwanged against its knee. Something cracked. The creature buckled. She swung again, a two-handed blow to its ribs. Another sickening crunch.

The creature turned on her, giving me its side. I jammed the barrel of the pistol into its ribcase and fired the last round point-blank. The thing let out a shriek of pure agony.

The creature reeled back, a spray of dark fluid gushing from the new hole in its side. It hissed, legs buckling beneath it. It took a step forward and collapsed hard, one hand clawing at the floor like it still wanted to fight. 

I stood there with the revolver hanging useless in my hand, ears ringing, lungs barely working. My jacket, my hands, my face—everything was slick with its blood. Thick, black, warm. It dripped off my fingers and splattered onto the wrecked floor like oil.

I couldn’t move. My brain felt unplugged. Like if I stayed perfectly still, none of this would be real.

“Roen.” Maya’s voice sounded far away. Then closer. “Roen—look at me.”

I didn’t.

She grabbed my wrists hard. Her hands were shaking worse than mine. “Hey. Hey. We have to go. Right now.”

I blinked. My eyes burned. “My mom… Kiana…”

“I know, babe,” she said, voice cracking but steady anyway. “But we can’t stay here.”

Something deep in me fought that. Screamed at me to stay. To do something. To not leave them like this. 

Maya tugged me toward the door. I let her.

We stumbled out into the cold night, slipping in the torn-up dirt. The air hit my face and I sucked it in like I’d been underwater too long. The sky above the cabin was alive.

Shapes moved across it—dark figures lifting off from the ground, rising in spirals and lines, mounting beasts that shouldn’t exist. Antlers. Wings. Too many legs. Too many eyes. The sound came back, clearer now: bells, laughter, howling wind.

They rose over the treeline in a long, crooked procession, silhouettes cutting across the moon. And at the front of it—
I stopped dead.

The sleigh floated higher than the rest, massive and ornate, pulled by creatures that looked like reindeer only in the loosest sense. Their bodies were stretched wrong, ribs showing through skin, eyes glowing like coals.

At the reins stood him.

Tall. Broad. Wrapped in red that looked stained in blood. His beard hung in clumps, matted and dark. His smile was too wide, teeth too many. A crown of antlers rose from his head, tangled with bells that rang wrong—deep, warped.

He reached down into the sleigh, grabbed something that kicked and screamed, and hauled it up by the arm.

Nico.

My brother thrashed, crying, his small hands clawing at the edge of the sleigh. I saw his face clearly in the firelight—terror, confusion, mouth open as he screamed my name.

“NO!” I tried to run. Maya wrapped her arms around my chest and hauled me back with everything she had.

The figure laughed. A deep, booming sound that echoed through the trees and into my bones. He shoved Nico headfirst into a bulging sack already writhing with movement—other kids, other screams—then tied it shut like it was nothing.

The sleigh lurched forward.The procession surged after it, riders whooping and shrieking as they climbed into the sky. 

Something dragged itself out of the cabin behind us.

The wounded creature. The one we thought was dead.

It staggered on three limbs, leaving a thick trail of blood across the porch and into the dirt. It let out a broken, furious cry and launched itself forward as the sleigh passed overhead.

Its claws caught the back rail of the sleigh. It slammed into the side hard, dangling there, legs kicking uselessly as the procession carried it upward. Blood sprayed out behind it in a long, dark arc, raining down through the trees.

For a few seconds, it hung on. Dragged. Refused to let go.
Then its grip failed.

The creature fell.

It vanished into the forest below with a distant, wet crash that echoed once and then went silent.

The sleigh didn’t slow.

The Santa thing threw his head back and laughed again, louder this time, like the sound itself was a victory. Then the hunt disappeared into the clouds, the bells fading until there was nothing left but wind and ruined trees and the broken shell of the cabin behind us.

—

We just sat down in the dirt a few yards from the cabin and held onto each other like if we let go, one of us would disappear too.

I don’t know how long it was. Long enough for the cold to stop mattering. Long enough for my hands to go numb around Maya’s jacket. Long enough for my brain to start doing this stupid thing where it kept trying to rewind, like maybe I’d missed a moment where I could’ve done something different.

It was Maya who finally remembered the phone.

“Roen,” she said, voice hoarse. “We have to call the police….”

My hands shook so bad I dropped my phone twice before I managed to unlock the screen. There was dried blood in the cracks of the case. I dialed 911 and put it on speaker because I didn’t trust myself to hold it.

The dispatcher’s voice was calm. Too calm.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

—

The cops showed up fast. Faster than I expected. Two cruisers at first, then more. Red and blue lights flooded the trees like some messed-up holiday display.

They separated us immediately.

Hands up. On your knees. Don’t move.

I remember one of them staring at my jacket, at the black blood smeared down my arms, and his hand never left his gun.

They asked us what happened. Over and over. Separately. Same questions, different words.

I told them there were things in the house. I told them they killed everyone. I told them they weren't human.

That was the exact moment their faces changed.

Not fear. Not concern.

Suspicion.

They cuffed my hands. Maya’s too. 

At first, they tried to pin it on me. Or maybe both of us. Kept pressing like we were hiding something, like maybe there was a fight that got out of hand, or we snapped, or it was drugs. Asked where I dumped Nico’s body.

One of the detectives took the revolver out of an evidence bag and set it on the table of the interrogation room like it was a point he’d been waiting to make.

“So you fired this?”

“Yes,” I said. “At the thing.”

“What thing?”

I looked at him. “The thing that killed my family.”

He wrote something down and nodded like that explained everything.

When the forensics team finally showed up and started putting the scene together, it got harder to make it stick. The blood patterns, the way the bodies were torn apart—none of it made sense for a standard attack. Way too violent. Way too messy. Too many injuries that didn’t line up with the weapons they found. No human did that. No animal either, far as they could tell. But they sure as hell weren’t going to write “mythical sky monsters” in the report.

Next theory? My dad.

But he was still locked up. Solid alibi. The detectives even visited him in prison to personally make sure he was still there. 
After that, they looked at Rick. Tasha’s boyfriend. Only problem? They found him too. What was left of him, anyway. His body was found near the front yard, slumped against a tree. Neck snapped like a twig.

That’s when they got quiet. No more hard questions. Just forms. Statements. A counselor.

We were minors. No surviving family. That part was simple.
Child Protect Services got involved.

They wanted to split us up. Said it was temporary, just until they could sort everything out. I got assigned a group home in Clovis. Maya got somewhere in Madera.

—

The day they told me I was getting moved, I didn’t even argue. There wasn’t any fight left. Just this empty numbness that settled behind my ribs and stayed there. The caseworker—Janine or Jenna or something—told me the social worker wanted to talk before the transfer. I figured it was some last-minute paperwork thing.

Instead, they walked me into this windowless office and shut the door behind me.

Maya was already there.

She looked as rough as I felt—pale, shadows under her baby-blue eyes. When she saw me, she blinked like she wasn’t sure I was real. We just stood there for a second.

Then she crossed the room and hugged me so hard it hurt.
I held on. Didn’t say anything. Couldn’t.

“Hey,” she said into my shoulder. Her voice shook once. “Hey,” I replied.

“I thought they sent you away already,” I said.

“Almost,” she said. “Guess we got a delay.”

We pulled apart when someone cleared their throat.

I looked up to see a woman already in the room, standing near the wall.

She was in her late thirties, maybe. She didn’t look like a social worker I’d ever seen. Didn’t smell like stale coffee or exhaustion. Black blazer and jeans. Her dark brown hair was cropped short and neat. Her hazel eyes were sharp, measuring, like she was sizing up threats.

She closed the door behind her.

“I’m glad you two got a moment to catch up,” she said calmly. “Please, sit.”

“My name is Agent Sara Benoit,” she said.

The woman waited until we were seated before she spoke again. She didn’t rush it. Let the silence stretch just long enough to feel intentional.

“I know you’ve already talked to the police,” she said. “Multiple times.”

I let out a short, tired laugh. “Then why are we here again?”
She looked at me directly. Not through me. Not like I was a problem to solve. “Because I’m not with the police.”

Maya stiffened beside me. I felt it through her sleeve.

I said, “So what? You’re a shrink? This is where you tell us we’re crazy, right?”

Benoit shook her head. “No. This is where I tell you I believe you.”

That landed heavier than any I’d heard so far.

I stared at her. “You… what?”

“I believe there was something non-human involved in the killings at that cabin,” she said. Flat. Like she was reading off a weather report. “I believe what you saw in the sky was real. And I believe the entity you described—what the media will eventually call an animal or a cult or a psychotic break—is none of those things.”

The room was quiet except for the hum of the lights.

Maya spoke up. “They said we were traumatized. That our minds filled in the gaps.”

Benoit nodded. “That’s what they have to say. It keeps things neat.”

That pissed me off more than anything else she could’ve said.

“Neat? I saw my family slaughtered,” I said. My voice stayed level, but it took work. “I watched something dressed like evil Santa kidnap my brother . If you’re about to tell me to move on, don’t.”

Benoit didn’t flinch.

“I’m not here to tell you that,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that what took your brother isn’t untouchable. And what killed your family doesn’t get to walk away clean.”

My chest tightened. Maya’s fingers found mine under the table and locked on.

I shook my head. “The fuck can you do about it? What are you? FBI? CIA? Some Men in Black knockoff with worse suits?”

She smirked at my jab, then reached into her blazer slowly, deliberately, like she didn’t want us to think she was pulling a weapon. She flipped open a leather badge wallet and slid it across the table.

‘NORAD
 Special Investigations Division’

The seal was real. The badge was heavy. Government ugly. No flair.

“…NORAD?” I said. “What’s that?”

“North American Aerospace Defense Command,” she explained. “Officially, we track airspace. Missiles. Unidentified aircraft. Anything that crosses borders where it shouldn’t.”

“What the hell does fucking NORAD want with us?” I demanded.

Benoit didn’t flinch. She just stated, “I’m here to offer you a choice.”

“A choice?” Maya asked.

She nodded. “Option one: you go to group homes, therapy, court dates. You try to live with what you saw. The official story will be ‘unknown assailants’ and ‘tragic circumstances.’ Your brother will be listed as deceased once the paperwork catches up.”

My chest burned. “And the other option?”

“Option two,” she said, her voice low and steady, “you come with me. You disappear on paper. New names, new files. You train with us. You learn what these things are, and how to kill them. Then you find the ones who did this. You get your brother back, and you make them pay.”",2,1765844752.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False
1pnns19,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1pnns19/i_realized_im_more_productive_working_remote/,I realized I’m more productive working remote because I stopped pretending to look busy,"This thought hit me kinda randomly during  a slow afternoon. Back when I worked in an office, so much of my energy went into looking like I was working. Tabs open, typing noises, walking fast with a coffee, answering messages  instantly even if they werent important. It felt like half the job was performance, not actual output. 

Working remote slowly stripped that away.  No one sees me sitting still and thinking. No one notices if I take five minutes just staring at the wall before starting a task. And once that pressure dissapeared, I realized how much  fake busyness I used to create just to look engaged. Now I just do the thing, or I dont, and that’s it. No theater. 

What’s funny is that I’m not working  more hours. If anything, I’m working less. But the work that actually matters gets done faster because I’m not wasting energy on optics. It kinda messed with my head to realize how much of “being productive” before was just making sure other people believed I was. Remote work  didn’t magically fix my focus, it just removed the audience.",17,1765844729.0,remotework,8,0.95,False

 Waves rippled over the gold speckled chlorophyll sea; skyward stalks stretched tall and moved as one, silk strands were whipping with the wind creating the illusion of crests and crashes in this aqueous flora. I sat watching the infinite stretch of corn; my blonde hair whipping synchronously with the stalks, my boots being used mindlessly to carve a small trench in the hillside, and my fingers fighting to pick the pink nail polish off of each other. It was morning, early enough that I didn't have anything to do yet but late enough that the roosters had stopped crowing; I liked this time. Today was looking to be a rough one; I was my father’s only child so he put me on a pedestal; but he was predestined to be a farmer so it was a pedestal made of hay and scrap wood. In his world I was his princess who should want for nothing, but in the real world that same princess works in the shit and heat to keep the kingdom running. It’s the end of summertime and while normal children were drenched with chlorinated water and stuffed with sugary treats from a truck; I was getting drenched with sweat and snacking on leathery jerky from our recent slaughter. 

It wasn’t all bad, I know I'm not selling it well but I promise it wasn’t all bad. 

Despite their messy nature and tendency to throw tantrums, I loved the animals on our farm. We had your basic fare; a few pretty cows, a lot of clueless chickens, some goats that didn't understand personal space, and an anxious horse. I loved them all … except for the horse, I tolerated him. He gave me such an uneasy feeling when he would look at me with those empty eyes. 

I used to give all of them names but as the years have gone on I realized it's a lot easier to eat your dinner when you don’t know exactly who you’re eating… they just come and go… That damn horse is the only one that stays around.

I also really enjoyed spending time in the woods around us. Ever since I turned 11 at the start of the summer my dad has let me explore pretty deep and I have grown very fond of my surroundings. Before I used to have to stay within sight of wherever my dad was working on the farm; it was pretty difficult with the dense foliage on some parts of our property. This summer though, when I didn’t have to help my dad around the farm I spent the time walking through the forest, marking my way on the rocks and trees and trying to find something new each time I went out. Sometimes I'd find a nice pond with a surface that hadn’t been disturbed since its beginning,  or I'd find a meadow with a family of deer, grazing gently before they galloped into the distance.

As of late I’ve been getting really frustrated. I have a central point within the woods, a clearing within the trees fully covered by the overhead canopy. This is my crossroads, the middle of the forest as I had declared it. It had four diverging paths which I had called North, South, East, and West without ever bringing a compass out there. I explored in a rotational pattern and as of late I haven't been able to go west; every time I tried, about an hour into my trek I’d run into construction. It varies on the level of completion and business based on my position, but a wall of construction consistently blocks my escapades. I’m sure it’s planned to be a brand new motel, meant to trap families into this nothing town for a while and boost our miniscule influence; or a new block of spaces for rent that will take turns opening and failing until we run out of small business dreamers in this town. I hate this pointless construction… I hate those stupid tractors that scream obscenities during the bird’s songs… I hate the men who spit and laugh as they rip the roots and ransack the land… I hate that they feel they have the right to intrude on this space. 

It was late August when things started to shift in strange ways; a particularly nasty storm had blown through the day before, I was off school and decided to explore the woods for any debris that might’ve blown through. The morning air smelled damp and sweet, I walked along the “South” path, boots soft against the mossy earth and leaving a clear trail for me to follow back. I was far enough from the construction that all I could hear here were the occasional calls of birds, wind weaving its way through tangles of branches, and the faint rustle of leaves. Though in the back I knew the machines were chewing the forest apart somewhere beyond the ridges; here, the world felt like it was okay. I walked for a while until I had to stop and double take suddenly the forest…changed. It didn’t move necessarily, but one second it looked a certain way and the next it seemed like an entirely new path had opened up. The trees thinned uncharacteristically in this spot, a little bit past them a small hollow I hadn’t noticed before had formed. I swore I had walked this path countless times and never seen anything resembling this. 

I stepped closer, curiosity pulling me in. 

The formation was strange; tall, straight trunks that twisted suddenly, subtly, at impossible angles; their bark patches of thick stone like scales and sections of smooth blackened curves, bare and scorched by a flame the rest of the earth suggested had never existed. Higher up, branches curved toward each other, meeting overhead to form arches, almost like the forest had decided to shape itself into a cathedral. Sunlight broke through the canopy in golden slivers in scattered beams and hit the trunks in odd ways: one shaft made the bark directly ahead gleam with a wet, oily sheen, though the earth around it was bone-dry. 

I circled the hollow slowly, fingertips brushing the cold, smooth bark surrounding me. It was unnerving, yes, but more fascinating than frightening. There was a rhythm here, the air almost musical, the way the trunks leaned and bent, purposeful. A subtle hum vibrated in the space, not loud enough to earn a name but enough to make my hair prickle. I tilted my head and listened, half-expecting it to vanish if I blinked, but it stayed, patient and still.

A thin wisp of fog clung to the roots, curling like smoke around the bases of the trees. I knelt to touch it, and it was neither wet nor cold, just… present, like it had been waiting for me. The smell of the forest changed slightly here, something richer, darker, more ancient. I shivered but smiled, curiosity overrode everything. Something about it made me feel like I was the first to see it, the only one who had the right to wander here.

Yet, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the trees were watching. Not in the way animals watch, but in some way older; more patient, more knowing. They leaned, they twisted, and they breathed in a rhythm of their own making, inviting me to stay and explore, but warning me at the same time that the forest had rules I didn’t yet understand.

I stood, brushing the fog from my knees, and took one last look before moving on. The hollow seemed smaller from the edge, more like a trick of the woods than a formation. But I knew I’d be back. Something about it had lodged itself in my chest, quiet and persistent, whispering that the forest was older and stranger than I’d ever believed.

A time later school had finally started up, the late seasonal storms persisted, I trudged up the hill leading from school, backpack sagging and shoes caked with mud from the rains. The sun was still high, promising the kind of golden afternoon that made me want to disappear into the woods, follow the paths for hours, maybe the storms had opened up a new section I hadn’t seen before.

“Suzannah!” Dad’s voice carried across the yard before I even reached the gate. He was leaning on the handle of a pitchfork, right next to the door, ready with assumptions. His shoulders were squared and eyes tired but alert. “Throw your things in your room real quick. There’s work to do.”

I sighed dramatically. “I was just about to-”

“Just cause school’s done for the day doesn’t mean you get off, not with the barns still needing prep.”

I stomped my boot. “I don’t care about the barns! I want to go explore! There’s probably scrap blown around and-”

“No,” he said, sharp, cutting me off. “You’ll help me clean out the pig pen and then maybe you can go out. The last storm tore half the fencing down, if you think I’m doing it alone, think again.”

I groaned. “That’s disgusting!”

“It’s called responsibility,” he said, jaw tight. “I don’t get to choose and neither do you, it’s just something we have to do.”

We argued for a while longer, my protests echoing against the house walls while he stayed immovable until finally I gave in, dragging myself toward the pen with as much theatrical misery as I could muster. 

The smell hit me first, the lingering tang of mud and urine, warm and sour; and then the sight, trampled straw, upturned soil, a dozen pigs sniffing and squealing at our intrusion. I rolled up my sleeves and shoved past the disgusting muck. Hours passed in silence broken only by the low grunt of pigs and Dad’s occasional barked instruction.

By the time the last corner of the pen was scrubbed and the fence repaired, the sun was dipping low, streaking the sky with reds and violets. I brushed straw from my hair and wiped sweat from my forehead.

“Can I just go a little ways into the woods? Before it gets too dark?” I asked, voice tentative, almost pleading.

Dad hesitated, hands on his hips; His eyes softened, but only a fraction. “Just a little,” he said finally. “Stay close to the South path. Don’t wander where the forest’s thick. I don’t want to have to come looking for you.”

I barely thanked him, sprinting past the barn and down the gentle slope toward the trees, boots crunching on leaves and squelching mud. The woods were transforming, shadows lengthening, the gradient of sunset giving way to deepening blues. The fog from the morning still clung lightly to the roots and hollows here, curling around my ankles as if curious to follow me.

It was beautiful, free, peaceful…until the light faded further.

I slowed and noticed as shapes in the woods seemed to stretch and lean where they hadn’t before, branches whispered together in a wind I couldn’t feel, eyes of bystanders shone bright in the last light fighting to stay. My pulse quickened and the golden path home felt impossibly far. I told myself I was imagining it, that the forest was just big and quiet. I kept calm and collected and was near our home when I turned one of the last corners. In the spot where the willow usually stood, sheltering and soft; the shadows thickened into a void, a dark wall of trees that sucked all the sound away from the space and seemingly wanted to suck me in too. A shiver ran down my spine, I spun on my heels and ran, faster than I’d ever run before; boots slipping on wet leaves, arms crashing through sharp branches, my chest heaving and begging for air. 

I ran and ran until finally, the house came into view. I didn’t slow down, didn’t stop, and didn’t look back. I flew past Dad, still at the barn, looking at me with that small mix of worry and exhaustion in his eyes. I didn’t pause, didn’t speak, didn’t catch my breath until I slammed my bedroom door behind me and collapsed onto the bed, heart hammering, blanket pulled tight around me. I stayed like this for a long while, panicked and trying to do anything to slow the rise and fall of my breath, confused how my woods could ever make me feel this way, angry my father had been proven right in his worries.

Outside, the forest settled into dark silence, the wind shifting gently. Nothing had overtly chased me. Nothing touched me. But in the quiet, I knew the woods had been watching, patient and unyielding… dangerous. I collapsed into sleep, not because i wanted too, but out of mental and physical exhaustion

Morning slid slowly over the sky, clouded in gray and fighting to let the light through. It was the kind of light that felt like it had to work hard to get all the way down into our little kitchen. I padded in half-awake, still feeling the leftover ache in my legs and lungs from the night before. Dad was already at the table, elbows braced on either side of his coffee like he was keeping it from running away.

He glanced up when I came in. Not sharply, more like he’d been waiting for the moment our eyes would meet and dreaded it a little. I stood by the doorway.

“You sleep okay?” he asked.

“Yes,” I lied and it came out too quick, too neat, almost rude.

Dad nodded, his fingers drummed once against the mug. “Good. That’s good.” He took a sip then cleared his throat in a way that meant he had been rehearsing the next sentence. “Listen. I, uh… I don’t want you going out that late again. Not by the woods. Not like that.”

I waited for the familiar need to argue; the immediate spark of but it’s my time, my place, my woods; the usual urge to push back just on principle. Instead there was a cool and hollow space where that feeling should’ve been. The memory of the forest in near total darkness, the way the shapes stretched wrong, how the paths seemed to bend in ways they didn’t initially shook me even now.

“I won’t,” I said. The surprise hit both of us at the same time.

Dad blinked. “You won’t?”

“No.” I forced a little shrug, casual, but my stomach felt tight. “It was… darker than I thought. I’ll go earlier next time.”

This was true, it had been darker and scarier than I’d expected, but there was something more. This feeling that even though nothing physically happened to me, I needed to be wary of my former safe space. He watched me for a long moment, eyes narrowed in that way that meant he was trying to see more than I was saying. Maybe he did. Maybe he didn’t. Either way, he just reached for his mug again and said, “Alright then. Thank you.”

I sat down across from him, the chair felt colder than it should. The woods, my woods, weren’t supposed to scare me. They’d always been the place I slipped into when everything else felt too loud. But now, thinking about them there was a thin shiver up my back, something I couldn’t name. The trees weren’t just trees last night. The quiet wasn’t just quiet. The paths hadn’t felt like they were leading to anything; more like they’d been waiting for me to follow them too far.

I didn’t want Dad to see any of that on my face, so I looked down at the table instead. There was a grain in the wood shaped almost like an eye, something I’d never noticed before. It stared at me until I looked away. Dad didn’t say anything else and neither did I. The silence between us wasn’t the usual kind. It felt like we were both listening for something; him for whatever had changed in me, and me for whatever was still out there in the shifting half-light of the forest. Breakfast continued, the tension slowly defrosting as time passed, we arrived at something semi-normal by the end of it.

Dad and I got around to the more mundane chores around the house for a few hours, by the time we were ready to leave for a little break the clouds had thinned enough to let the sun through in pale patches, the brightening of the day also seemed to brighten our moods. Dad tossed me the keys without looking and told me to start the car up while he grabbed some things.

“Don’t touch the radio.” he said habitually.

“I won’t!” I slyly replied, climbing into the passenger seat of his truck, the vinyl still cold against the backs of my legs. The engine coughed to life like it always did, a sound so familiar and comforting; I flipped from his country hits of the 1800’s station and found something at least a little listenable. 

Dad jumped in the truck and feigned a disgruntled look.

“It was like that when I got in.” I giggled. 

Dad flashed a little smile and we started down the driveway, tires crunching over gravel, the farm shrinking behind us in the side mirror. The woods slipped past in quiet clusters, and I made a point not to stare too long at them.

Dad drummed his fingers against the steering wheel, then cleared his throat. “We’ve been working for a bit, you hungry?”

“Always.”

“Wanna grab something from Pat real quick?”

“Yes please! That ol girl we sent to him awhile back looked like real good eatin, hopefully we get some of her.”

He snorted despite himself and changed his map. A few seconds later, he reached over, turned the radio dial, and rolled the windows down. It was some old country station crackling through the speakers; He didn’t sing, but he hummed, barely, under his breath. The music rang out 

“And did I hear you say he was a-meetin' you here today. 

To take you to his mansion in the sky?”

It felt nice. Normal. Like the quiet from earlier had been packed away somewhere neither of us needed to look at just yet.

As we got closer to town the woods gave way to fields and the fields gave way to scattered houses and sun-faded signs. The storm had left everything washed clean, puddles still lingered in the cracks of the road and gave it all a sheen in the sunlight. Dad slowed as we passed the water tower, coming to a stop and nodding once at a man leaning against a fence who lifted two fingers in return. He lumbered over to our truck with a gait that was both powerful and painful. We hopped out and met him in the middle.

“Mornin Buddy” he called to my father, shaking his hand, “Hey sunshine” he smiled at me “Need anything special today?”

I thought about it. “Maybe jerky… and those weird sodas you got, the ones in glass bottles...please”

He smiled, small and soft. “You’ve got good taste little lady.”

He lumbered to his truck parked over in the grass and grabbed his homemade goods, we exchanged money then conversation then pleasantries until we finally left about an hour later. My dad and I snacked and laughed as we drove.

The truck rolled to a stop in front of the general store, its front windows cluttered with handwritten signs and artifactual advertisements. 

“Alright,” he said, opening his door. “Let’s get what we need before you convince me to buy nonsense.”

I hopped down after him, the bell above the store door chiming as he pushed it open, warm light spilling out to greet us. We walked into the same scene I’d seen thousands of times, walls of snacks with distinct gaps where items had hadn’t been refilled in years, tchotchkes for the weary traveler in case they want to reminisce on some random nothing town they stopped to pee at, supplies for the people who actually lived here, and two faces I'd easily call family; Mr. and Mrs. Cooke. They had been running the general store since well before I’d been born, They were in their mid 70’s now but the walls were plastered with the different eras of their life; mixed between fishing records caught in our creeks, pamphlets about local hunting and fishing guidelines, and drawings from children, long moved on to bigger places. 

As soon as we stepped inside Dad leaned down just enough for only me to hear him,

“Be good,” he said, not stern, just a reminder. “I’m gonna grab feed and bolts. Say hi to the Cooke’s.”

“I never wander and I was going to anyway” I said, sounding snippy but meaning to be reassuring.

He gave me a look that said he didn’t believe me then smiled and tussled my hair and headed down one of the narrow aisles, boots thudding softly against the worn floorboards.

The heavy wooden door hadn’t even finished settling when Mrs. Cooke looked up from behind the counter. Her face brightened in that familiar loving way, like flipping on a light that had been turned on and off a thousand times before.

“Well I’ll be,” she beamed. “If it isn’t Suzie.”

“Hi, Mrs. Cooke,” I smiled, already drifting closer.

Mr. Cooke pushed himself up from the stool beside her with a grunt that sounded like it had more weight than it used to. “Dang sweetie you’re getting tall,” he said, squinting at me the same way he always did, like this was new information every time. “Did you grow again?”

“I don’t think so,” I said. “I think you just keep forgetting how tall I already am.”

He laughed at that, slow and genuine. “That could be.”

Mrs. Cooke reached out and wrapped me in a hug, her touch papery but warm. “How’s school treating you, sweetheart?”

“It’s fine,” I said. “Boring. But i’m doing well in all my classes.”

She nodded like that answered everything. “That’s good. Boring is good. Means nothing’s gone wrong.”

Mr. Cooke shuffled behind the counter and bent down, rummaging through a drawer that squeaked in protest. “I got something for you,” he said, voice muffled. He emerged holding a small, carved bass. “Finished this yesterday. Thought of you.”

I took it carefully. “Thank you sir, it’s so pretty.”

Mrs. Cooke smiled, but there was something soft and tired behind it. Mr. Cooke smiled with her, “You’re always so polite.”

The store hummed around us; the fridges buzzing, the old ceiling fan ticking like it was holding on for its life, the light murmur of the old radio, unable to be turned off out of the fear it’ll never turn on again. 

I noticed, suddenly, the energy of the room shifted.

Mr. Cooke leaned his elbows on the counter, close now. “You still walking those woods?” he asked, casual, like he was asking about the weather, but stern enough to imply a truthful response was necessary.

I hesitated, just a beat. “Not as much,” I said.

Mrs. Cooke nodded slowly. “That happens,” she said. “This place has been changing, things have felt off.”

From the aisle behind me, I heard Dad’s footsteps returning. Mrs. Cooke squeezed my sleeve once more before letting go.

“You watch after your father,” she said.

“I will,” I promised.

Dad appeared beside me, arms full, giving them a nod. “She behave?”

“Always does,” Mr. Cooke said, smiling. “You’re raisin her right.”

We paid and I glanced back at them as we walked away from the counter, these two familiar figures behind the same old register, standing in a store that felt like it was gently holding its breath.

For a moment, I had the strangest urge to stay a little longer.

The drive back was easy, dad didn’t say much, expect much; he just hummed along with the radio again, one hand steady on the wheel with the other resting loose out the window. I leaned back against the seat, with jerky half-forgotten in my pocket and the glass bottle rolling gently against my ankle every time we hit a bump.

The town slipped away behind us. Houses thinned into fields, fields into fence lines, fence lines into trees. I watched it all pass through the dusty windows, sunlight flashing between branches in soft stuttering patterns. The woods still made my stomach tighten if I looked too long, but it wasn’t sharp anymore. More like a bruise you forgot about until you pressed on it.

Dad reached over at one point and cracked my window open a little wider. “You good?” he asked, eyes still on the road.

“Yeah,” I said… I meant it.

The sun was warm where it spilled through the glass, settling across my arms and face. The truck’s engine droned, low and constant while the radio faded into something indistinct; voices and strings blending into a soft blur. My eyelids grew heavy before I could fight it. I shifted, tucking my chin down, letting the rhythm of the road carry me.

I fell asleep feeling safe.

When I woke, the light had changed.

For a second I didn’t know where I was. The world rocked gently beneath me, slow and patient, like breathing. Then the smell of grass and dirt came through without the feeling of them. The distant sound of cicadas rang in a rising chorus. I blinked, squinting up at the sky.

I was in the hammock.

The old one Dad strung between the two trees behind the house, the fabric worn thin and soft from years of use. A blanket was tucked around my legs, careful, like someone had tried not to wake me. My shoes were resting in the grass to my left. My head rested against something folded just right…Dad’s jacket, placed there to look like an afterthought but requiring more thought than he’d admit out loud.

The sky above me was brushed in deepening oranges and purples, dusk settling in slowly and deliberately. The clouds caught the last of the sun’s fire, glowing at their edges before dimming and settling into their nightly forms. The air had cooled, just enough to raise goosebumps on my arms.

I laid there and listened.

The farm was quietly active in its usual ways. Somewhere a door creaked, an animal shifted, the wind moved through leaves in a low hush. Nothing felt wrong. Nothing felt rushed.

Dad must’ve noticed me asleep when we got back, must’ve decided I needed the rest. I pictured him lifting me out of the truck, awkward and careful, pretending I weighed less than I did. The thought made my chest ache in a small, gentle way.

I turned my head slightly, watching the treeline darken as the sun slipped lower. The woods were there, just as they always had been. Tall. Still. Waiting. But from here, wrapped in fabric and warmth, they felt far away, contained by distance and light and the quiet confidence of being on the land I knew.

I knew, distantly, that something had shifted. That the woods were no longer just woods; that the quiet carried more weight than it used to; that paths could change if you weren’t paying attention. But for now, the hammock held me, the sky burned beautifully, and the day loosened its grip.

I closed my eyes again, not to sleep this time, just to rest there a moment longer…suspended between light and dark, between the sky and the earth, between childhood and whatever waited next….content, despite it all.

I'm Going to Get Him Back (Part 1),"When dad got locked up again, it didn’t hit right away. He’d been in and out since I was nine, but this time felt different. Longer sentence. Something about assault with a weapon and parole violations. My mom, Marisol, cried once, then shut down completely. No yelling, no last minute plea to judge for leniency—just silence.

“He’s going away for at least fifteen years.”

It wasn’t news. We all knew. I’d heard her crying about it on the phone to my grandma in the Philippines through the paper-thin wall. My little sister, Kiana heard it too but didn’t say anything. Just curled up on the mattress with his headphones on, pretending she couldn’t. 

Then mom couldn’t make rent. The landlord came by with that fake sympathy, like he felt bad but not bad enough to wait one more week for rent before evicting us. 

Our house in Fresno was one of those old stucco duplexes with mold in the vents and a broken front fence. Still, it was home. 

“We’ll get a fresh start,” Mom said.

And by “fresh start,” she meant a cabin in the Sierra Nevada that looked cheap even in blurry online photos. The only reason it was so affordable was because another family—who was somehow even worse off than we were—was willing to split the cost. We’d “make it work.” Whatever that meant.

I packed my clothes in trash bags. My baby brother, Nico, clutched his PS4 the whole time like someone was gonna steal it. Mom sold the washer and our living room couch for gas money.

When we finally pulled up, the place wasn’t a cabin so much as a box with windows. The woods pressed tight around it like the trees wanted to swallow it whole.

“Looks haunted,” I muttered, stepping out of the car and staring at the place. It had a sagging roof, moss creeping up one side, and a screen door that hung off one hinge like it gave up trying years ago.

Nico’s face scrunched up. “Haunted? For real?”

I shrugged. “Guess we’ll find out tonight.”

“We will?” He whispers.

Mom shot me that look. “Seriously, Roen?” she snapped. “You think this is funny? No, baby, it’s not haunted.” She reassured Nico.

I swung one of the trash bags over my shoulder and headed for the front door. The steps creaked loud under my feet, like even they weren’t sure they could hold me. Just as I reached for the knob—
I heard voices. Two people inside, arguing loud enough that I didn’t need to strain to catch it.

“I’m not sharing a room with some random people, Mom!” Said a girl’s voice. 

A second voice fired back, older, calmer but tight with frustration. “Maya, we’ve been over this. We don’t have a choice.”

Then I heard footsteps—fast ones, heavy and pissed off, thudding through the cabin toward the door.

Before I could move out of the way or even say anything, the front door flung open hard—right into me. The edge caught me square in the shoulder and chest, knocking the air out of me as I stumbled backward and landed flat on the porch with a loud thump.

“Shit,” I muttered, wincing.

A shadow filled the doorway. I looked up and there she was—the girl, standing over me with wide eyes and a face full of panic.

“Oh my god—I didn’t see you,” she said, breathless. “Are you okay? I didn’t—God, I’m sorry.”

She knelt down a little, hand halfway out like she wasn’t sure if she should help me up or if she’d already done enough damage.

I sat up, rubbing my ribs and trying not to look like it actually hurt as bad as it did. “Yeah,” I grunted. “I mean, it’s just a screen door. Not like it was made of steel or anything.”

I grabbed her outstretched hand. Her grip was stronger than I expected, but her fingers trembled a little.

She looked about my age—sixteen, maybe seventeen—with this messy blonde braid half falling apart and a hoodie that looked like it had been through a few too many wash cycles. Her nails were painted black, chipped down to the corners. She didn’t let go of my hand right away.

Her face changed fast. Like something hot in her just shut off the second our eyes locked. The sharp edge drained out of her expression, like she forgot what she was mad about.

“I didn’t know anyone was standing out here,” she said again, softer this time. “I just... needed air.”

“It’s all good,” I said, brushing dirt off my jeans and trying to gather my spilled stuff. “Not my first time getting knocked down today.”

She glanced awkwardly back inside. “So... guess that means you’re the people we’re sharing this dump with?”

“Yup. The other half of the broke brigade.”

She held out her hand. “I’m Maya.”

I took it. “Roen.”

“Let me guess…say you’re here because of someone else’s screw-up.”

“How’s you know?” I asked surprised.

She shrugged. “Let’s just say you’re not the only one.” 

Behind me, Nico whispered, “Is she a ghost?”

Maya raised an eyebrow. “Who's that?”

“My brother. He’s eight. He’s gonna ask a million questions, so get ready.”

She smirked. “Bring it on. I’ve survived worse.”
I believed her.

Kiana was already climbing out of the car, dragging her own trash bag behind her, when she caught sight of me and Maya still talking.

“Ohhh,” she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, drawing out the sound with a stupid grin. “Roen’s already got a girlfriend in the woods.”

I rolled my eyes. “Shut up, Kiana.”

Maya snorted but didn’t say anything, just crossed her arms and waited like she was curious how this was gonna play out.

“I’m just saying,” she whispered, “you’ve known her for like two minutes and you’re already helping each other off the porch like it’s a rom-com.”

“You’re not even supposed to know what that is.”
“I’m twelve, not dumb.”

“She’s cute,” Kiana added, smirking now as she walked past. “Y’all gonna braid each other’s hair later?”

“I swear to god—”

“Language,” Mom chided from behind me. 

Before I could fire back, the front door creaked open again, and a woman stepped out. Thin, wiry frame. She wore a faded flannel and sweatpants like she’d stopped trying to impress anyone years ago. Her eyes darted across us—counting, maybe—and her smile didn’t quite reach all the way up.

“You must be the Mayumis,” she said. Her voice was raspy, probably from too many cigarettes or too many bad nights. Maybe both. “I’m Tasha. Tasha Foster.”

She stepped closer, and the smell hit me—sharp and bitter. Whiskey. 

Mom appeared behind us just in time. “Hi, I’m Marisol,” she said quietly, arms crossed like she already regretted every decision that led us here.

They hugged briefly. More of a press of shoulders than a real embrace. Tasha nodded toward the cabin. “We’re tight on space, but we cleared out the back room. Me, you, and the girls can take that. The boys can have the den.”

“Boys?” I asked, stepping into the doorway and immediately getting swarmed by noise.

Inside, it looked like someone tried to clean but gave up halfway through. There were dishes drying on one side of the sink, and unfolded laundry piled on the couch. A crusty pizza box sat on the counter next to an open bottle of something that definitely wasn’t juice.

Then came the thundering feet—three of them. First was a chubby kid with wild curls and a superhero shirt that was two sizes too small. He stopped, blinked at us, then just yelled, “New people!”

A girl around Kiana’s age followed, hair in tight braids and a glare that said she didn’t trust any of us. Behind her was a tall, lanky boy with headphones around his neck and that look teens get when they’re stuck somewhere they hate.

Maya rolled her eyes. “These are my siblings. That loud one’s Jay, the girl with the death stare is Bri, and the quiet one’s Malik.”

Jay darted toward Nico immediately, pointing at the PS4. “You got games?!”

Nico lit up. “A bunch.”

Mom and Tasha slipped into the kitchen to talk in low voices while the rest of us stood there in this weird moment of strangers under one roof. 

Maya looked around at the chaos. “So… welcome to the party.”

“Some party,” I muttered, but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth.

Kiana elbowed me. “I like it here,” she said.

—

Starting a new school in the middle of the year is trash. No one tells you where anything is, teachers already have favorites, and everybody’s locked into their little cliques like they’re afraid being friendly’s contagious.

Maya and I ended up in the same homeroom, which helped. It was the only part of the day that didn’t feel like I was walking into someone else’s house uninvited. She sat two rows over at first, headphones in, scribbling in the margins of a beat-up copy of The Bell Jar. I didn’t even know she read stuff like that.

We got paired up in Physics too—lab partners. I’m more of the “just tell me what to do and I’ll do it” type when it comes to school. I play ball. Football mostly, but I’m decent at track. Maya actually liked the subject. Asked questions. Took notes like they meant something. The first week, I thought we’d hate working together—like she’d think I was an idiot or something—but it wasn’t like that. She explained things without making it weird. 

She’d let me copy her answers—but only after I tried to understand them first.

At lunch, she sat outside under the trees near the side parking lot. Alone at first. I started joining her, ditching my usual spot with the guys.

I soon found out why she kept to herself. It started small. A few whispers behind cupped hands, little laughs when Maya walked past in the hallway. She didn’t react at first, just rolled her eyes and kept walking. But I saw the tightness in her jaw. The way her grip on her backpack straps got a little firmer.

Then one day, someone didn’t bother whispering.

The comments started behind her back—“Isn’t she the one with the crackhead mom?”, “Heard she’s got, like, four half-siblings. All different dads.” 

I felt Maya tense beside me. Not flinch—just go still, like something inside her snapped into place. She didn’t say anything. Didn’t even look at them. She just turned and walked fast, then faster, then she was running down the hall.

“Yo,” I called after her, but she was already gone.
I spun back to the group gossiping. 

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I snapped. Heads turned. Good. 

One of the guys laughed. “Relax, man. It’s just facts.”

“Facts?” I stepped closer. “You don’t know shit about her.”

The girl rolled her eyes. “She’s gonna end up just like her mom anyway. Everyone knows that.”

“Oh fuck off!” I shouted. I didn’t wait. I took off after Maya.

I checked the bathroom first. Empty. Then the quad. Nothing. My last period bell rang, but I didn’t care. I headed to the library because it was the only quiet place left in this school.

She was tucked into the far back corner, half-hidden behind the tall shelves nobody ever went to. Sitting on the floor. Knees pulled in. Hoodie sleeve pushed up.

My stomach dropped.

“Maya,” I said, low. Careful.

She didn’t look up.

I took a few slow steps closer and saw it—the razor in her hand. 

Her arm was a roadmap of old lines. Some faded. Some not.

“Hey,” I said, softer now. “Don’t.”

Her hand paused.

“You’re not allowed to say that,” she muttered. Her voice was wrecked. “You don’t get to stop me.”

“I know,” I said. “But I’m asking anyway.”

She laughed once, sharp and ugly. “They’re right, you know. About me. About all of it.”

I crouched down in front of her, keeping my hands where she could see them. “They don’t know you.”

“They know enough,” she said. “My mom’s an addict. She disappears for days. Sometimes weeks. We all got different dads. None of them stuck. People hear that and they already got my ending figured out.”

“You’re not,” I said.

She lifted the razor slightly. “You don’t know that.”

She finally looked at me. Her blue eyes were red, furious, tired. “You think I don’t see it? I’m already halfway there.”

I swallowed. “I know what it’s like when everyone assumes you’re trash because of who raised you.”
That got her attention.

“My dad’s been locked up most of my life,” I said. “I’ve got scars too.” I tapped my knuckles. Old marks. “From standing up to him when I shouldn’t have. From thinking I could fix things if I just tried harder.”
She stared at my hands like she was seeing them for the first time.

“I used to think if I didn’t fight back, I’d turn into him,” I went on. “Turns out, fighting him didn’t make me better either. Just made everything louder.”

Her grip on the razor loosened a little.

I reached out slowly. “Can you give me that?”

She hesitated. Long enough that my heart was pounding in my ears. Then she dropped the razor into my palm like it weighed a thousand pounds.

She covered her face and finally broke.

I stayed there. Didn’t try to fix it. Didn’t say the wrong hopeful crap. Just sat on the library floor with her while she cried it out.

—
​​That night, I knocked on Maya’s door after everyone had crashed.

“I have an idea,” I whispered. “It’s mean though…”
Maya smirked. “The meaner the better.”

That morning, we showed up to school early. We had backpacks full of supplies—a screwdriver, glitter, expired sardines, and four tiny tubes of industrial-strength superglue.

We snuck into the locker hallway when the janitor went for his smoke break. Maya kept lookout while I unscrewed the hinges on three locker doors—each one belonging to the worst of the trash-talkers. We laced the inside edges with glue, so when they slammed shut like usual, they’d stay that way. 

Inside one of them, we left a glitter bomb rigged to pop the second the door opened. In another, Maya stuffed the expired sardines into a pencil pouch and superglued that shut too. The smell would hit like a punch in the face.

We barely made it to homeroom before the chaos started.

First period: screaming from the hallway. Second period: a janitor with bolt cutters. By third period, the whole school was buzzing.

And then we got called to the office.

We got caught on cameras. Of course. We didn’t even try to lie. Just sat there while the vice principal read us the suspension notice like he was personally offended.

“Three days. Home. No extracurriculars. You’re lucky we’re not calling the police.”

Outside the office, Maya bumped my shoulder. “Worth it?”

I grinned. “Every second.”

—

I got my permit that November. Mom let me borrow the car sometimes, mostly because she was too tired to argue. We made it count—gas station dinners, thrift store photo shoots, late-night drives to nowhere.

We’d sneak out some nights just to lie in the truck bed and stare at the stars through the trees, counting satellites and pretending they were escape pods.

The first time she kissed me, it wasn’t planned. We were sitting in the school parking lot, waiting for the rain to let up. She just looked over and said, “I’m gonna do something stupid,” then leaned in before I could ask what. After that, it all moved fast.

The first time we had sex was in the back of the car, parked on an old forestry road, all fumbling hands and held breath. We thought we were careful.

The scare happened two weeks later. A late period, a pregnancy test from the pharmacy. The longest three minutes of our lives, standing in that cabin’s moldy bathroom, waiting. When it was negative, we didn’t celebrate. She laughed. I almost cried.

After that, we thought more about the future. Maya started talking about college more. Somewhere far. I didn’t have plans like that, but I was working weekends at the pizza shop, and started saving. Not for clothes or games—just for getting out. 

—

By December, things settled down a bit. We tried to make the best of the holidays. All month, the cabin smelled like pine and mildew and cheap cinnamon candles. We’d managed to scrape together some decorations—paper snowflakes, a string of busted lights that only half worked, and a sad fake tree we found at the thrift store for five bucks. Nico hung plastic ornaments like it was the real deal. Kiana made hot cocoa from a dollar store mix and forced everyone to drink it. Mom even smiled a few times, though it never lasted.

Maya and I did our part. Helped the little kids wrap presents in newspaper. Made jokes about how Santa probably skipped our cabin because the GPS gave up halfway up the mountain. 

Even Tasha seemed mellow for once.

But then Christmas Eve hit. 

Maya’s mom announced that afternoon she was inviting her new boyfriend over for dinner. Some dude named Rick or Rich or something. Maya went quiet first, then full-on exploded.

“You’re kidding, right?” she snapped. “You’re really bringing some random guy here? On Christmas Eve?”

Tasha shrugged like it was no big deal. “He’s not random. I’ve known him for months.”

“And that makes it fucking okay? And now we’re supposed to play happy family?”

“Watch your mouth.”

“Or what? You’ll vanish for a week and pretend this never happened?”

Tasha lit a cigarette inside the house, which she only did when she was mad. “It’s my house, Maya. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”

Maya laughed. “Gladly.”

She grabbed her bag and was out the door before I could say anything. I followed.

We sat on the steps while the cold settled into our bones. She didn’t talk. Just stared out at the trees, fists clenched in her lap like she was holding herself together by force. I leaned over, bumped her shoulder.

“Let’s bounce.”

She looked at me. “Where?""

“Anywhere but here.”

So we sneaked out. I borrowed Mom’s car.

We drove up to a dirt road, way up past the ranger station, where the trees cleared and gave you this wide, unreal view of the valley below. You could see for miles.

I popped the trunk, and we sat with our legs hanging out the back, wrapped in a blanket. I pulled out the six-pack I’d stashed—some knockoff lager from that corner store near school that never asked questions. Maya lit a joint she’d swiped from her mom’s stash and passed it to me without saying anything.

We just sat there, knees touching, sipping beer and smoking the joint, watching our breath cloud up in the freezing air. Maya played music off her phone, low. Some old indie Christmas playlist she’d downloaded for the irony.

At one point, she leaned her head on my shoulder.

“Thanks,” she whispered.

“For what?”

“For giving me something that doesn’t suck.”

—

Maya was humming some half-forgotten carol when I noticed it—this streak of light cutting across the night sky, low and fast. At first I thought it was just a shooting star, but it didn’t fizzle out like it was supposed to. It curved. Like it was changing direction. Like it knew where it was going.

“Did you see that?” I asked.

She lifted her head. “What?”

I pointed. “That...”

Maya squinted. “What am I supposed to be looking at?”
I fumbled the binoculars from the glovebox—old ones my uncle gave me for spotting deer. I raised them to my eyes.

I held them up so that Maya could see too, adjusted the focus, and froze.

Maya noticed right away. “What? What is it?”

Through the binoculars, there were figures—too many to count, all of them fast. Not like planes. More like shadows ripping across the sky, riding... something. Horses, maybe. Or things shaped like horses but wrong. Twisted. And riders—tall, thin figures wrapped in cloaks that whipped in the wind, some with skull faces, some with no faces at all. Weapons glinted in their hands. Swords. Spears. Chains.

“Oh. No,” Maya whispered. 

“What is it?” I asked.

She looked at me. “It’s heading towards the cabin.”

I snatched the binoculars back, my hands shaking so hard the image blurred. It took me three tries to steady them against my face.

She was right.

The things weren’t just in the sky anymore. They were descending, a dark wave pouring down the tree line toward the base of the mountain. Toward our road. Toward the cabin.

“We have to go. Now.” 

We scrambled into the car. I spun the tires in the dirt, wrenching the wheel toward home. The headlights carved a shaky path through the dark as we flew down the mountain road, branches slapping the windshield.
“Call my mom,” I told Maya, handing my phone to her. 
“Put it on speaker.”
The ringing seemed to last forever. Mom picked up.

“Roen? Where are you? Where’s the car?” The anger was a live wire.

“Mom, listen! You have to get everyone inside. Lock the doors. Right now.”

“What are you talking about? Are you in trouble?”

“Mom, no! Listen! There’s something coming. From the sky. We saw it. It’s coming down the mountain toward the cabin.”

A beat of dead silence. Then her tone, cold and disbelieving. “Have you been doing drugs? Is Maya with you?”

“Mom, I swear to God, I’m… Please, just look outside. Go to a window and look up toward the ridge.”

“I’m looking, Roen. I don’t see anything but trees and…” She trailed off. I heard a faint, distant sound through the phone, like bells, but twisted and metallic. “What is that noise?”

Then, Nico’s voice, excited in the background. “Mom! Mom! Look! It’s Santa’s sleigh! I see the lights!”

Kiana joined in. “Whoa! Are those reindeer?”

“Kids, get back from the window,” Mom said, but her voice had changed. The anger was gone, replaced by a slow-dawning confusion. The bells were louder now, mixed with a sound like wind tearing through a canyon.

“Mom, it’s NOT Santa!” I was yelling, my foot pressing the accelerator to the floor. The car fishtailed on a gravel curve. “Get everyone and run into the woods! Now!”

The line went quiet for one second too long. Not dead quiet—I could hear the muffled rustle of the phone in my mom’s hand, a sharp intake of breath.

Then the sounds started.

Not bells anymore. Something lower, a grinding hum that vibrated through the phone speaker. It was followed by a skittering, scraping noise, like claws on slate, getting closer. Fast.

“Marisol?” Tasha’s voice, distant and confused. “Is something on the roof?”

A thud shook the line, so heavy it made my mom gasp. Then a shriek—not human, something high and chittering.

A window shattered. A massive, bursting crunch, like something had come straight through the wall.

Then the screams started.

Not just screams of fear. These were sounds of pure, physical terror. Kiana’s high-pitched shriek cut off into a gurgle. Nico wailed, “Mommy!” before his voice was swallowed by a thick, wet thud and a crash of furniture.

“NO! GET AWAY FROM THEM!” My mom’s voice was raw, a warrior’s cry. I heard a grunt of effort, the smash of something heavy—maybe a lamp, a chair—connecting, followed by a hiss that was absolutely not human.

Tasha was cursing, a stream of furious, slurred shouts. There was a scuffle, then a body hitting the floor.

“ROEN!” My mom screamed my name into the phone. It was the last clear word.

A final, piercing shriek was cut short. Then a heavy, dragging sound. 

The line hissed with empty static for three heartbeats.

Then it went dead.

The car tore around the last bend. The cabin came into view, every window blazing with light. The front door was gone. Just a dark, open hole.

I slammed on the brakes, the car skidding to a stop fifty yards away.

The car was still ticking when I killed the engine. 
Maya grabbed my arm. “Roen. Don’t.”

I pulled free. My legs felt numb, like they didn’t belong to me anymore, but they still moved. Every step toward the house felt wrong, like I was walking into a memory that hadn’t happened yet.

The ground between us and the cabin was torn up—deep gouges in the dirt, snapped branches, something dragged straight through the yard. The porch was half gone. The roof sagged in the middle like it had been stepped on.

We desperately called our family’s names. But some part of me already knew no one would answer.
The inside smelled wrong. Something metallic and burnt.

The living room barely looked like a room anymore. Furniture smashed flat. Walls cracked. Blood everywhere—smeared, sprayed, soaked into the carpet so dark it almost looked black. Bodies were scattered where people had been standing or running.

Jay was closest to the door. Or what was left of him. His body lay twisted at an angle that didn’t make sense, like he’d been thrown. 

Bri was near the hallway. She was facedown, drowned in her own blood. One arm stretched out like she’d been reaching for someone. Malik was farther back, slumped against the wall, eyes open but empty, throat cut clean. 

Tasha was near the kitchen. Or what was left of her. Her torso was slashed open, ribs visible through torn fabric. Her head was missing. One hand was clenched around a broken bottle, like she’d tried to fight back even when it was already over.

Maya dropped to her knees.

“No, mommy, no…” she said. Over and over. 

I kept moving because if I stopped, I wasn’t sure I’d start again.

My hands were shaking so bad I had to press them into my jeans to steady myself.

“Mom,” I called out, even though I already knew.

The back room was crushed inward like something heavy had landed there.

Mom was on the floor. I knew it was her because she was curled around a smaller body.

Kiana was inside her arms, turned into my mom’s chest. Her head was gone. Just a ragged stump at her neck, soaked dark. My mom’s face was frozen mid-scream, eyes wide, mouth open, teeth bared.

I couldn’t breathe. My chest locked up, and for a second I thought I might pass out standing there.
I dropped to my knees anyway.

“I’m sorry,” I said. To both of them. To all of them. Like it might still matter.

Then, something moved.

Not the house settling. Not the wind. This was close. Wet. Fast.

I snapped my head toward the hallway and backed up on instinct, almost slipping in blood. My heart was hammering so hard it felt like it was shaking my teeth loose.

“Maya,” I said, low and sharp. “Get up. Something’s still here.”

She sucked in a breath like she’d been punched and scrambled to her feet, eyes wild. I looked around for anything that wasn’t broken or nailed down.

That’s when I saw my mom’s hand.

Tucked against her wrist, half-hidden by her sleeve, was a revolver. The snub‑nose she kept buried in the back of the closet “just in case.” I’d seen it once, years ago, when she thought my dad was coming back drunk and angry.

I knelt and pried it free, gently, like she might still feel it.

The gun was warm.

I flipped the cylinder open with shaking fingers. Five loaded chambers. One spent casing.

“She got a shot off,” I whispered. 

Maya was already moving. She grabbed a bat leaning against the wall near the tree—aluminum, cheap, still wrapped with a torn bow. Jay’s Christmas present. She peeled the plastic off and took a stance like she’d done this before.

The thing scuttled out of the hallway on all fours, moving with a broken, jerky grace. It was all wrong—a patchwork of fur and leathery skin, twisted horns, and eyes that burned like wet matches. It was big, shoulders hunched low to clear the ceiling. And on its flank, a raw, blackened crater wept thick, tar-like blood. My mom’s shot.

Our eyes met. Its jaws unhinged with a sound like cracking ice.

It charged.

I didn’t think. I raised the revolver and pulled the trigger. The first blast was deafening in the shattered room. It hit the thing in the chest, barely slowing it. I fired again. And again. The shots were too fast, my aim wild. I saw chunks of it jerk away. One shot took a piece of its ear. Another sparked off a horn.
It was on me.

The smell hit—old blood and wet earth. A claw swiped, ripping my jacket.

That’s when the bat connected.

Maya swung from the side with everything she had. The aluminum thwanged against its knee. Something cracked. The creature buckled. She swung again, a two-handed blow to its ribs. Another sickening crunch.

The creature turned on her, giving me its side. I jammed the barrel of the pistol into its ribcase and fired the last round point-blank. The thing let out a shriek of pure agony.

The creature reeled back, a spray of dark fluid gushing from the new hole in its side. It hissed, legs buckling beneath it. It took a step forward and collapsed hard, one hand clawing at the floor like it still wanted to fight. 

I stood there with the revolver hanging useless in my hand, ears ringing, lungs barely working. My jacket, my hands, my face—everything was slick with its blood. Thick, black, warm. It dripped off my fingers and splattered onto the wrecked floor like oil.

I couldn’t move. My brain felt unplugged. Like if I stayed perfectly still, none of this would be real.

“Roen.” Maya’s voice sounded far away. Then closer. “Roen—look at me.”

I didn’t.

She grabbed my wrists hard. Her hands were shaking worse than mine. “Hey. Hey. We have to go. Right now.”

I blinked. My eyes burned. “My mom… Kiana…”

“I know, babe,” she said, voice cracking but steady anyway. “But we can’t stay here.”

Something deep in me fought that. Screamed at me to stay. To do something. To not leave them like this. 

Maya tugged me toward the door. I let her.

We stumbled out into the cold night, slipping in the torn-up dirt. The air hit my face and I sucked it in like I’d been underwater too long. The sky above the cabin was alive.

Shapes moved across it—dark figures lifting off from the ground, rising in spirals and lines, mounting beasts that shouldn’t exist. Antlers. Wings. Too many legs. Too many eyes. The sound came back, clearer now: bells, laughter, howling wind.

They rose over the treeline in a long, crooked procession, silhouettes cutting across the moon. And at the front of it—
I stopped dead.

The sleigh floated higher than the rest, massive and ornate, pulled by creatures that looked like reindeer only in the loosest sense. Their bodies were stretched wrong, ribs showing through skin, eyes glowing like coals.

At the reins stood him.

Tall. Broad. Wrapped in red that looked stained in blood. His beard hung in clumps, matted and dark. His smile was too wide, teeth too many. A crown of antlers rose from his head, tangled with bells that rang wrong—deep, warped.

He reached down into the sleigh, grabbed something that kicked and screamed, and hauled it up by the arm.

Nico.

My brother thrashed, crying, his small hands clawing at the edge of the sleigh. I saw his face clearly in the firelight—terror, confusion, mouth open as he screamed my name.

“NO!” I tried to run. Maya wrapped her arms around my chest and hauled me back with everything she had.

The figure laughed. A deep, booming sound that echoed through the trees and into my bones. He shoved Nico headfirst into a bulging sack already writhing with movement—other kids, other screams—then tied it shut like it was nothing.

The sleigh lurched forward.The procession surged after it, riders whooping and shrieking as they climbed into the sky. 

Something dragged itself out of the cabin behind us.

The wounded creature. The one we thought was dead.

It staggered on three limbs, leaving a thick trail of blood across the porch and into the dirt. It let out a broken, furious cry and launched itself forward as the sleigh passed overhead.

Its claws caught the back rail of the sleigh. It slammed into the side hard, dangling there, legs kicking uselessly as the procession carried it upward. Blood sprayed out behind it in a long, dark arc, raining down through the trees.

For a few seconds, it hung on. Dragged. Refused to let go.
Then its grip failed.

The creature fell.

It vanished into the forest below with a distant, wet crash that echoed once and then went silent.

The sleigh didn’t slow.

The Santa thing threw his head back and laughed again, louder this time, like the sound itself was a victory. Then the hunt disappeared into the clouds, the bells fading until there was nothing left but wind and ruined trees and the broken shell of the cabin behind us.

—

We just sat down in the dirt a few yards from the cabin and held onto each other like if we let go, one of us would disappear too.

I don’t know how long it was. Long enough for the cold to stop mattering. Long enough for my hands to go numb around Maya’s jacket. Long enough for my brain to start doing this stupid thing where it kept trying to rewind, like maybe I’d missed a moment where I could’ve done something different.

It was Maya who finally remembered the phone.

“Roen,” she said, voice hoarse. “We have to call the police….”

My hands shook so bad I dropped my phone twice before I managed to unlock the screen. There was dried blood in the cracks of the case. I dialed 911 and put it on speaker because I didn’t trust myself to hold it.

The dispatcher’s voice was calm. Too calm.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

—

The cops showed up fast. Faster than I expected. Two cruisers at first, then more. Red and blue lights flooded the trees like some messed-up holiday display.

They separated us immediately.

Hands up. On your knees. Don’t move.

I remember one of them staring at my jacket, at the black blood smeared down my arms, and his hand never left his gun.

They asked us what happened. Over and over. Separately. Same questions, different words.

I told them there were things in the house. I told them they killed everyone. I told them they weren't human.

That was the exact moment their faces changed.

Not fear. Not concern.

Suspicion.

They cuffed my hands. Maya’s too. 

At first, they tried to pin it on me. Or maybe both of us. Kept pressing like we were hiding something, like maybe there was a fight that got out of hand, or we snapped, or it was drugs. Asked where I dumped Nico’s body.

One of the detectives took the revolver out of an evidence bag and set it on the table of the interrogation room like it was a point he’d been waiting to make.

“So you fired this?”

“Yes,” I said. “At the thing.”

“What thing?”

I looked at him. “The thing that killed my family.”

He wrote something down and nodded like that explained everything.

When the forensics team finally showed up and started putting the scene together, it got harder to make it stick. The blood patterns, the way the bodies were torn apart—none of it made sense for a standard attack. Way too violent. Way too messy. Too many injuries that didn’t line up with the weapons they found. No human did that. No animal either, far as they could tell. But they sure as hell weren’t going to write “mythical sky monsters” in the report.

Next theory? My dad.

But he was still locked up. Solid alibi. The detectives even visited him in prison to personally make sure he was still there. 
After that, they looked at Rick. Tasha’s boyfriend. Only problem? They found him too. What was left of him, anyway. His body was found near the front yard, slumped against a tree. Neck snapped like a twig.

That’s when they got quiet. No more hard questions. Just forms. Statements. A counselor.

We were minors. No surviving family. That part was simple.
Child Protect Services got involved.

They wanted to split us up. Said it was temporary, just until they could sort everything out. I got assigned a group home in Clovis. Maya got somewhere in Madera.

—

The day they told me I was getting moved, I didn’t even argue. There wasn’t any fight left. Just this empty numbness that settled behind my ribs and stayed there. The caseworker—Janine or Jenna or something—told me the social worker wanted to talk before the transfer. I figured it was some last-minute paperwork thing.

Instead, they walked me into this windowless office and shut the door behind me.

Maya was already there.

She looked as rough as I felt—pale, shadows under her baby-blue eyes. When she saw me, she blinked like she wasn’t sure I was real. We just stood there for a second.

Then she crossed the room and hugged me so hard it hurt.
I held on. Didn’t say anything. Couldn’t.

“Hey,” she said into my shoulder. Her voice shook once. “Hey,” I replied.

“I thought they sent you away already,” I said.

“Almost,” she said. “Guess we got a delay.”

We pulled apart when someone cleared their throat.

I looked up to see a woman already in the room, standing near the wall.

She was in her late thirties, maybe. She didn’t look like a social worker I’d ever seen. Didn’t smell like stale coffee or exhaustion. Black blazer and jeans. Her dark brown hair was cropped short and neat. Her hazel eyes were sharp, measuring, like she was sizing up threats.

She closed the door behind her.

“I’m glad you two got a moment to catch up,” she said calmly. “Please, sit.”

“My name is Agent Sara Benoit,” she said.

The woman waited until we were seated before she spoke again. She didn’t rush it. Let the silence stretch just long enough to feel intentional.

“I know you’ve already talked to the police,” she said. “Multiple times.”

I let out a short, tired laugh. “Then why are we here again?”
She looked at me directly. Not through me. Not like I was a problem to solve. “Because I’m not with the police.”

Maya stiffened beside me. I felt it through her sleeve.

I said, “So what? You’re a shrink? This is where you tell us we’re crazy, right?”

Benoit shook her head. “No. This is where I tell you I believe you.”

That landed heavier than any I’d heard so far.

I stared at her. “You… what?”

“I believe there was something non-human involved in the killings at that cabin,” she said. Flat. Like she was reading off a weather report. “I believe what you saw in the sky was real. And I believe the entity you described—what the media will eventually call an animal or a cult or a psychotic break—is none of those things.”

The room was quiet except for the hum of the lights.

Maya spoke up. “They said we were traumatized. That our minds filled in the gaps.”

Benoit nodded. “That’s what they have to say. It keeps things neat.”

That pissed me off more than anything else she could’ve said.

“Neat? I saw my family slaughtered,” I said. My voice stayed level, but it took work. “I watched something dressed like evil Santa kidnap my brother . If you’re about to tell me to move on, don’t.”

Benoit didn’t flinch.

“I’m not here to tell you that,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that what took your brother isn’t untouchable. And what killed your family doesn’t get to walk away clean.”

My chest tightened. Maya’s fingers found mine under the table and locked on.

I shook my head. “The fuck can you do about it? What are you? FBI? CIA? Some Men in Black knockoff with worse suits?”

She smirked at my jab, then reached into her blazer slowly, deliberately, like she didn’t want us to think she was pulling a weapon. She flipped open a leather badge wallet and slid it across the table.

‘NORAD
 Special Investigations Division’

The seal was real. The badge was heavy. Government ugly. No flair.

“…NORAD?” I said. “What’s that?”

“North American Aerospace Defense Command,” she explained. “Officially, we track airspace. Missiles. Unidentified aircraft. Anything that crosses borders where it shouldn’t.”

“What the hell does fucking NORAD want with us?” I demanded.

Benoit didn’t flinch. She just stated, “I’m here to offer you a choice.”

“A choice?” Maya asked.

She nodded. “Option one: you go to group homes, therapy, court dates. You try to live with what you saw. The official story will be ‘unknown assailants’ and ‘tragic circumstances.’ Your brother will be listed as deceased once the paperwork catches up.”

My chest burned. “And the other option?”

“Option two,” she said, her voice low and steady, “you come with me. You disappear on paper. New names, new files. You train with us. You learn what these things are, and how to kill them. Then you find the ones who did this. You get your brother back, and you make them pay.”",1,1765844575.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False
1pnnoe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/1pnnoe2/type_me_questionnaire/,Type me questionnaire,"Type, instincts, tritype, triads - anything you see. Very interested to hear everyone's reasoning.

1. What are your views on the good things in life? Do they happen naturally, or do you have to create them yourself？How do they manifest into reality?

All things naturally tend towards chaos, so you'll most likely get a mixed experience. Someone gifting you their ticket when you walk past a venue entrance because they just found out they can't go? Pure luck. But if it's something specific you really want, you have to actively pursue it, place yourself in the right environments, and give that thing a chance to align with you. The conditions you were born into also play a significant part in this. Depending on what you want for yourself, you might have to work harder and smarter if you don't get a head start.

2. What are your views on the bad things in life? What are the reasons they happen? How much control do you really have over such matters?

You can certainly carve out a path for yourself, but you have to stay focused and not give importance to what you don't want. You can't know everything before you try it, and making mistakes on the way is not an issue. If you're willing to fail and learn from experiences you can often get to your destination faster.

3. How attached are you to your emotions? How often do you express them to others? What even is the purpose of such feelings? And what are the biases that impede your judgements?

I'm attached to a mix of anticipation and surprise much more than the rest. I don't really mind negative emotions because experiencing the full specter feels more valuable. I express this to people, but not everyone gets access to the same things. It's not really about how close we are or how long we've known each other, it's more about the situation and what I know about them. Some people only hear about the good stuff, some predominantly about work, and more rarely about my struggles. I don't think anyone ever has the complete picture of what's going on in my life.

4. What do you want in life? Is it achievable? If people and obstacles are in your way, what would you do then? With resources being limited, is it ok to acquire essential needs by denying them to someone else?

To have a successful career, work on interesting and challenging projects with likeminded people, to be well-off, live in a beautiful place in a major city where there are many things going on every day. I don't see why it wouldn't be achievable. If other people can have it, so can I. I usually go around people and obstacles and find a new way to get the thing I want. Resources aren't limited (yet), they're badly distributed.

5. Are people inherently good or bad? Or is it neither? What do you believe when it comes to moral goodness? What duties do we all have as individuals?

People are naturally selfish. Morality is a slippery slope, especially when you try to apply your views to other people. Everyone should be able to express their opinions and get a fair chance to pursue what they want, as long as they don't intend to hurt other people.

6. Are you extroverted or introverted? If you're ambiverted, when do you lean on each side? What excites you? What drains your energy? How do you feel alive when plagued by boredom and the mundane?

I get energy from being around other creative and ambitious people. I'm extroverted, but I don't need to be around people all the time. I like chaos on my own terms and outside of my apartment. I get drained by being in low-stakes environments, when I can't see the point of what I'm doing and it feels like it's not transforming or advancing me in any way, by being around small-minded people who want to put you in the same box they put themselves, or people who want you to take it easy and have fun instead of supporting your goals. I also get really drained by pets and children.

7. What people/values/things do you hold dear to yourself? How do you prevent yourself from being separated from them? Does being disconnected scare you? Do you desire to fit in with the world?

Films and books I discover that fit what I'm experiencing perfectly and indirectly give me the answers I was searching for, things people say in passing that do the same thing - it doesn't matter if I like the person or not. I value when relationships feel 50/50, people who are encouraging, show effort and come up with things to do just as much as I do, who respond right away, show up on time, and generally make me feel like they respect my time and show interest in what I do. Being disconnected in a sense that no one knows about me and I'm completely untethered does scare me. I'm not afraid of doing things on my own, or moving away from everyone I love and being completely alone in a new place, however, because I always initiate things, and I never stay alone for long anywhere I go. I desire to fit in without losing my individuality.

8. What are the biggest disappointments you have? It doesn't even have to be something that happened to you personally. What is something you expected more from, but it somehow managed to fall short?

Those rare cases when I didn't do what I wanted to do, because I misjudged a situation or let someone else influence my decision. I often expect more from situations and end up being disappointed because they're too mundane. It's something about that mismatch that feels so hollow, either something visual, the place playing the wrong kind of music, people looking the part but saying the wrong things. I also expected something completely different from romantic relationships, but in this case, it feels like everyone is following the script too closely and has the same ideas about how things should go, and I just can't get on board with that.

9. What do you expect from others? Are you entitled to anything? Be it love or materialistic things. How easy is it to rely on others? To depend on something else outside of your control?

I've talked about the first half already. Relying on others comes easy if I observe them doing something in a way I find trustworthy. I can depend on other people to do their part, but I prefer to have split responsibilities. I don't feel the need to have complete control over everything, but I also enjoy leading, for example if I need to manage a project at work.

10. What are you as a person? How do you see yourself? How do others see you? How do you want others to see you? How do you want to see yourself?

People usually have a pretty correct impression of me. I'm practical, creative, efficient, resourceful, good in a crisis, motivated, friendly, witty, direct. The only thing that surprises me is that people often find me polarizing, but that's the price of being opinionated and having specific interests.

11. How do you organize your thoughts? What are concepts and ideas to you? How do you navigate through such a hazy frightening future? What do you believe are the most important questions one can ask?

I write most things down and make lists because it's too much hassle trying to remember everything. Concepts and ideas are great if they have practical application. That stuff about the future sounds very dramatic. I am focused on what I can do now and if what I'm doing is getting me closer to my goal, but I don't have everything planned out to the smallest detail because things are always changing and it would make no sense to follow a rigid plan. The most important question you can ask is if you're doing the most important thing for you at any given moment.

12. Are your instincts something to be trusted? Your first-impressions, or your natural intuition on things. How often, and when, are you on ""autopilot"" with your body? Doing things out of habit and muscle memory.

I'm very observant and I pick up on a lot of little clues, so I do trust my instincts. It also helps that I am usually aware of how I came to those conclusions. I'm very rarely on autopilot, and I don't really do anything out of habit or engage in any personal rituals. I am fine with coffee, without it, I'm not tired or annoyed if I have to wake up at 4am, but I can also get up at 9. None of this has any gravity for me.",1,1765844465.0,Enneagram,0,1.0,False

When dad got locked up again, it didn’t hit right away. He’d been in and out since I was nine, but this time felt different. Longer sentence. Something about assault with a weapon and parole violations. My mom, Marisol, cried once, then shut down completely. No yelling, no last minute plea to judge for leniency—just silence.

“He’s going away for at least fifteen years.”

It wasn’t news. We all knew. I’d heard her crying about it on the phone to my grandma in the Philippines through the paper-thin wall. My little sister, Kiana heard it too but didn’t say anything. Just curled up on the mattress with his headphones on, pretending she couldn’t. 

Then mom couldn’t make rent. The landlord came by with that fake sympathy, like he felt bad but not bad enough to wait one more week for rent before evicting us. 

Our house in Fresno was one of those old stucco duplexes with mold in the vents and a broken front fence. Still, it was home. 

“We’ll get a fresh start,” Mom said.

And by “fresh start,” she meant a cabin in the Sierra Nevada that looked cheap even in blurry online photos. The only reason it was so affordable was because another family—who was somehow even worse off than we were—was willing to split the cost. We’d “make it work.” Whatever that meant.

I packed my clothes in trash bags. My baby brother, Nico, clutched his PS4 the whole time like someone was gonna steal it. Mom sold the washer and our living room couch for gas money.

When we finally pulled up, the place wasn’t a cabin so much as a box with windows. The woods pressed tight around it like the trees wanted to swallow it whole.

“Looks haunted,” I muttered, stepping out of the car and staring at the place. It had a sagging roof, moss creeping up one side, and a screen door that hung off one hinge like it gave up trying years ago.

Nico’s face scrunched up. “Haunted? For real?”

I shrugged. “Guess we’ll find out tonight.”

“We will?” He whispers.

Mom shot me that look. “Seriously, Roen?” she snapped. “You think this is funny? No, baby, it’s not haunted.” She reassured Nico.

I swung one of the trash bags over my shoulder and headed for the front door. The steps creaked loud under my feet, like even they weren’t sure they could hold me. Just as I reached for the knob—
I heard voices. Two people inside, arguing loud enough that I didn’t need to strain to catch it.

“I’m not sharing a room with some random people, Mom!” Said a girl’s voice. 

A second voice fired back, older, calmer but tight with frustration. “Maya, we’ve been over this. We don’t have a choice.”

Then I heard footsteps—fast ones, heavy and pissed off, thudding through the cabin toward the door.

Before I could move out of the way or even say anything, the front door flung open hard—right into me. The edge caught me square in the shoulder and chest, knocking the air out of me as I stumbled backward and landed flat on the porch with a loud thump.

“Shit,” I muttered, wincing.

A shadow filled the doorway. I looked up and there she was—the girl, standing over me with wide eyes and a face full of panic.

“Oh my god—I didn’t see you,” she said, breathless. “Are you okay? I didn’t—God, I’m sorry.”

She knelt down a little, hand halfway out like she wasn’t sure if she should help me up or if she’d already done enough damage.

I sat up, rubbing my ribs and trying not to look like it actually hurt as bad as it did. “Yeah,” I grunted. “I mean, it’s just a screen door. Not like it was made of steel or anything.”

I grabbed her outstretched hand. Her grip was stronger than I expected, but her fingers trembled a little.

She looked about my age—sixteen, maybe seventeen—with this messy blonde braid half falling apart and a hoodie that looked like it had been through a few too many wash cycles. Her nails were painted black, chipped down to the corners. She didn’t let go of my hand right away.

Her face changed fast. Like something hot in her just shut off the second our eyes locked. The sharp edge drained out of her expression, like she forgot what she was mad about.

“I didn’t know anyone was standing out here,” she said again, softer this time. “I just... needed air.”

“It’s all good,” I said, brushing dirt off my jeans and trying to gather my spilled stuff. “Not my first time getting knocked down today.”

She glanced awkwardly back inside. “So... guess that means you’re the people we’re sharing this dump with?”

“Yup. The other half of the broke brigade.”

She held out her hand. “I’m Maya.”

I took it. “Roen.”

“Let me guess…say you’re here because of someone else’s screw-up.”

“How’s you know?” I asked surprised.

She shrugged. “Let’s just say you’re not the only one.” 

Behind me, Nico whispered, “Is she a ghost?”

Maya raised an eyebrow. “Who's that?”

“My brother. He’s eight. He’s gonna ask a million questions, so get ready.”

She smirked. “Bring it on. I’ve survived worse.”
I believed her.

Kiana was already climbing out of the car, dragging her own trash bag behind her, when she caught sight of me and Maya still talking.

“Ohhh,” she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, drawing out the sound with a stupid grin. “Roen’s already got a girlfriend in the woods.”

I rolled my eyes. “Shut up, Kiana.”

Maya snorted but didn’t say anything, just crossed her arms and waited like she was curious how this was gonna play out.

“I’m just saying,” she whispered, “you’ve known her for like two minutes and you’re already helping each other off the porch like it’s a rom-com.”

“You’re not even supposed to know what that is.”
“I’m twelve, not dumb.”

“She’s cute,” Kiana added, smirking now as she walked past. “Y’all gonna braid each other’s hair later?”

“I swear to god—”

“Language,” Mom chided from behind me. 

Before I could fire back, the front door creaked open again, and a woman stepped out. Thin, wiry frame. She wore a faded flannel and sweatpants like she’d stopped trying to impress anyone years ago. Her eyes darted across us—counting, maybe—and her smile didn’t quite reach all the way up.

“You must be the Mayumis,” she said. Her voice was raspy, probably from too many cigarettes or too many bad nights. Maybe both. “I’m Tasha. Tasha Foster.”

She stepped closer, and the smell hit me—sharp and bitter. Whiskey. 

Mom appeared behind us just in time. “Hi, I’m Marisol,” she said quietly, arms crossed like she already regretted every decision that led us here.

They hugged briefly. More of a press of shoulders than a real embrace. Tasha nodded toward the cabin. “We’re tight on space, but we cleared out the back room. Me, you, and the girls can take that. The boys can have the den.”

“Boys?” I asked, stepping into the doorway and immediately getting swarmed by noise.

Inside, it looked like someone tried to clean but gave up halfway through. There were dishes drying on one side of the sink, and unfolded laundry piled on the couch. A crusty pizza box sat on the counter next to an open bottle of something that definitely wasn’t juice.

Then came the thundering feet—three of them. First was a chubby kid with wild curls and a superhero shirt that was two sizes too small. He stopped, blinked at us, then just yelled, “New people!”

A girl around Kiana’s age followed, hair in tight braids and a glare that said she didn’t trust any of us. Behind her was a tall, lanky boy with headphones around his neck and that look teens get when they’re stuck somewhere they hate.

Maya rolled her eyes. “These are my siblings. That loud one’s Jay, the girl with the death stare is Bri, and the quiet one’s Malik.”

Jay darted toward Nico immediately, pointing at the PS4. “You got games?!”

Nico lit up. “A bunch.”

Mom and Tasha slipped into the kitchen to talk in low voices while the rest of us stood there in this weird moment of strangers under one roof. 

Maya looked around at the chaos. “So… welcome to the party.”

“Some party,” I muttered, but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth.

Kiana elbowed me. “I like it here,” she said.

—

Starting a new school in the middle of the year is trash. No one tells you where anything is, teachers already have favorites, and everybody’s locked into their little cliques like they’re afraid being friendly’s contagious.

Maya and I ended up in the same homeroom, which helped. It was the only part of the day that didn’t feel like I was walking into someone else’s house uninvited. She sat two rows over at first, headphones in, scribbling in the margins of a beat-up copy of The Bell Jar. I didn’t even know she read stuff like that.

We got paired up in Physics too—lab partners. I’m more of the “just tell me what to do and I’ll do it” type when it comes to school. I play ball. Football mostly, but I’m decent at track. Maya actually liked the subject. Asked questions. Took notes like they meant something. The first week, I thought we’d hate working together—like she’d think I was an idiot or something—but it wasn’t like that. She explained things without making it weird. 

She’d let me copy her answers—but only after I tried to understand them first.

At lunch, she sat outside under the trees near the side parking lot. Alone at first. I started joining her, ditching my usual spot with the guys.

I soon found out why she kept to herself. It started small. A few whispers behind cupped hands, little laughs when Maya walked past in the hallway. She didn’t react at first, just rolled her eyes and kept walking. But I saw the tightness in her jaw. The way her grip on her backpack straps got a little firmer.

Then one day, someone didn’t bother whispering.

The comments started behind her back—“Isn’t she the one with the crackhead mom?”, “Heard she’s got, like, four half-siblings. All different dads.” 

I felt Maya tense beside me. Not flinch—just go still, like something inside her snapped into place. She didn’t say anything. Didn’t even look at them. She just turned and walked fast, then faster, then she was running down the hall.

“Yo,” I called after her, but she was already gone.
I spun back to the group gossiping. 

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I snapped. Heads turned. Good. 

One of the guys laughed. “Relax, man. It’s just facts.”

“Facts?” I stepped closer. “You don’t know shit about her.”

The girl rolled her eyes. “She’s gonna end up just like her mom anyway. Everyone knows that.”

“Oh fuck off!” I shouted. I didn’t wait. I took off after Maya.

I checked the bathroom first. Empty. Then the quad. Nothing. My last period bell rang, but I didn’t care. I headed to the library because it was the only quiet place left in this school.

She was tucked into the far back corner, half-hidden behind the tall shelves nobody ever went to. Sitting on the floor. Knees pulled in. Hoodie sleeve pushed up.

My stomach dropped.

“Maya,” I said, low. Careful.

She didn’t look up.

I took a few slow steps closer and saw it—the razor in her hand. 

Her arm was a roadmap of old lines. Some faded. Some not.

“Hey,” I said, softer now. “Don’t.”

Her hand paused.

“You’re not allowed to say that,” she muttered. Her voice was wrecked. “You don’t get to stop me.”

“I know,” I said. “But I’m asking anyway.”

She laughed once, sharp and ugly. “They’re right, you know. About me. About all of it.”

I crouched down in front of her, keeping my hands where she could see them. “They don’t know you.”

“They know enough,” she said. “My mom’s an addict. She disappears for days. Sometimes weeks. We all got different dads. None of them stuck. People hear that and they already got my ending figured out.”

“You’re not,” I said.

She lifted the razor slightly. “You don’t know that.”

She finally looked at me. Her blue eyes were red, furious, tired. “You think I don’t see it? I’m already halfway there.”

I swallowed. “I know what it’s like when everyone assumes you’re trash because of who raised you.”
That got her attention.

“My dad’s been locked up most of my life,” I said. “I’ve got scars too.” I tapped my knuckles. Old marks. “From standing up to him when I shouldn’t have. From thinking I could fix things if I just tried harder.”
She stared at my hands like she was seeing them for the first time.

“I used to think if I didn’t fight back, I’d turn into him,” I went on. “Turns out, fighting him didn’t make me better either. Just made everything louder.”

Her grip on the razor loosened a little.

I reached out slowly. “Can you give me that?”

She hesitated. Long enough that my heart was pounding in my ears. Then she dropped the razor into my palm like it weighed a thousand pounds.

She covered her face and finally broke.

I stayed there. Didn’t try to fix it. Didn’t say the wrong hopeful crap. Just sat on the library floor with her while she cried it out.

—
​​That night, I knocked on Maya’s door after everyone had crashed.

“I have an idea,” I whispered. “It’s mean though…”
Maya smirked. “The meaner the better.”

That morning, we showed up to school early. We had backpacks full of supplies—a screwdriver, glitter, expired sardines, and four tiny tubes of industrial-strength superglue.

We snuck into the locker hallway when the janitor went for his smoke break. Maya kept lookout while I unscrewed the hinges on three locker doors—each one belonging to the worst of the trash-talkers. We laced the inside edges with glue, so when they slammed shut like usual, they’d stay that way. 

Inside one of them, we left a glitter bomb rigged to pop the second the door opened. In another, Maya stuffed the expired sardines into a pencil pouch and superglued that shut too. The smell would hit like a punch in the face.

We barely made it to homeroom before the chaos started.

First period: screaming from the hallway. Second period: a janitor with bolt cutters. By third period, the whole school was buzzing.

And then we got called to the office.

We got caught on cameras. Of course. We didn’t even try to lie. Just sat there while the vice principal read us the suspension notice like he was personally offended.

“Three days. Home. No extracurriculars. You’re lucky we’re not calling the police.”

Outside the office, Maya bumped my shoulder. “Worth it?”

I grinned. “Every second.”

—

I got my permit that November. Mom let me borrow the car sometimes, mostly because she was too tired to argue. We made it count—gas station dinners, thrift store photo shoots, late-night drives to nowhere.

We’d sneak out some nights just to lie in the truck bed and stare at the stars through the trees, counting satellites and pretending they were escape pods.

The first time she kissed me, it wasn’t planned. We were sitting in the school parking lot, waiting for the rain to let up. She just looked over and said, “I’m gonna do something stupid,” then leaned in before I could ask what. After that, it all moved fast.

The first time we had sex was in the back of the car, parked on an old forestry road, all fumbling hands and held breath. We thought we were careful.

The scare happened two weeks later. A late period, a pregnancy test from the pharmacy. The longest three minutes of our lives, standing in that cabin’s moldy bathroom, waiting. When it was negative, we didn’t celebrate. She laughed. I almost cried.

After that, we thought more about the future. Maya started talking about college more. Somewhere far. I didn’t have plans like that, but I was working weekends at the pizza shop, and started saving. Not for clothes or games—just for getting out. 

—

By December, things settled down a bit. We tried to make the best of the holidays. All month, the cabin smelled like pine and mildew and cheap cinnamon candles. We’d managed to scrape together some decorations—paper snowflakes, a string of busted lights that only half worked, and a sad fake tree we found at the thrift store for five bucks. Nico hung plastic ornaments like it was the real deal. Kiana made hot cocoa from a dollar store mix and forced everyone to drink it. Mom even smiled a few times, though it never lasted.

Maya and I did our part. Helped the little kids wrap presents in newspaper. Made jokes about how Santa probably skipped our cabin because the GPS gave up halfway up the mountain. 

Even Tasha seemed mellow for once.

But then Christmas Eve hit. 

Maya’s mom announced that afternoon she was inviting her new boyfriend over for dinner. Some dude named Rick or Rich or something. Maya went quiet first, then full-on exploded.

“You’re kidding, right?” she snapped. “You’re really bringing some random guy here? On Christmas Eve?”

Tasha shrugged like it was no big deal. “He’s not random. I’ve known him for months.”

“And that makes it fucking okay? And now we’re supposed to play happy family?”

“Watch your mouth.”

“Or what? You’ll vanish for a week and pretend this never happened?”

Tasha lit a cigarette inside the house, which she only did when she was mad. “It’s my house, Maya. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”

Maya laughed. “Gladly.”

She grabbed her bag and was out the door before I could say anything. I followed.

We sat on the steps while the cold settled into our bones. She didn’t talk. Just stared out at the trees, fists clenched in her lap like she was holding herself together by force. I leaned over, bumped her shoulder.

“Let’s bounce.”

She looked at me. “Where?""

“Anywhere but here.”

So we sneaked out. I borrowed Mom’s car.

We drove up to a dirt road, way up past the ranger station, where the trees cleared and gave you this wide, unreal view of the valley below. You could see for miles.

I popped the trunk, and we sat with our legs hanging out the back, wrapped in a blanket. I pulled out the six-pack I’d stashed—some knockoff lager from that corner store near school that never asked questions. Maya lit a joint she’d swiped from her mom’s stash and passed it to me without saying anything.

We just sat there, knees touching, sipping beer and smoking the joint, watching our breath cloud up in the freezing air. Maya played music off her phone, low. Some old indie Christmas playlist she’d downloaded for the irony.

At one point, she leaned her head on my shoulder.

“Thanks,” she whispered.

“For what?”

“For giving me something that doesn’t suck.”

—

Maya was humming some half-forgotten carol when I noticed it—this streak of light cutting across the night sky, low and fast. At first I thought it was just a shooting star, but it didn’t fizzle out like it was supposed to. It curved. Like it was changing direction. Like it knew where it was going.

“Did you see that?” I asked.

She lifted her head. “What?”

I pointed. “That...”

Maya squinted. “What am I supposed to be looking at?”
I fumbled the binoculars from the glovebox—old ones my uncle gave me for spotting deer. I raised them to my eyes.

I held them up so that Maya could see too, adjusted the focus, and froze.

Maya noticed right away. “What? What is it?”

Through the binoculars, there were figures—too many to count, all of them fast. Not like planes. More like shadows ripping across the sky, riding... something. Horses, maybe. Or things shaped like horses but wrong. Twisted. And riders—tall, thin figures wrapped in cloaks that whipped in the wind, some with skull faces, some with no faces at all. Weapons glinted in their hands. Swords. Spears. Chains.

“Oh. No,” Maya whispered. 

“What is it?” I asked.

She looked at me. “It’s heading towards the cabin.”

I snatched the binoculars back, my hands shaking so hard the image blurred. It took me three tries to steady them against my face.

She was right.

The things weren’t just in the sky anymore. They were descending, a dark wave pouring down the tree line toward the base of the mountain. Toward our road. Toward the cabin.

“We have to go. Now.” 

We scrambled into the car. I spun the tires in the dirt, wrenching the wheel toward home. The headlights carved a shaky path through the dark as we flew down the mountain road, branches slapping the windshield.
“Call my mom,” I told Maya, handing my phone to her. 
“Put it on speaker.”
The ringing seemed to last forever. Mom picked up.

“Roen? Where are you? Where’s the car?” The anger was a live wire.

“Mom, listen! You have to get everyone inside. Lock the doors. Right now.”

“What are you talking about? Are you in trouble?”

“Mom, no! Listen! There’s something coming. From the sky. We saw it. It’s coming down the mountain toward the cabin.”

A beat of dead silence. Then her tone, cold and disbelieving. “Have you been doing drugs? Is Maya with you?”

“Mom, I swear to God, I’m… Please, just look outside. Go to a window and look up toward the ridge.”

“I’m looking, Roen. I don’t see anything but trees and…” She trailed off. I heard a faint, distant sound through the phone, like bells, but twisted and metallic. “What is that noise?”

Then, Nico’s voice, excited in the background. “Mom! Mom! Look! It’s Santa’s sleigh! I see the lights!”

Kiana joined in. “Whoa! Are those reindeer?”

“Kids, get back from the window,” Mom said, but her voice had changed. The anger was gone, replaced by a slow-dawning confusion. The bells were louder now, mixed with a sound like wind tearing through a canyon.

“Mom, it’s NOT Santa!” I was yelling, my foot pressing the accelerator to the floor. The car fishtailed on a gravel curve. “Get everyone and run into the woods! Now!”

The line went quiet for one second too long. Not dead quiet—I could hear the muffled rustle of the phone in my mom’s hand, a sharp intake of breath.

Then the sounds started.

Not bells anymore. Something lower, a grinding hum that vibrated through the phone speaker. It was followed by a skittering, scraping noise, like claws on slate, getting closer. Fast.

“Marisol?” Tasha’s voice, distant and confused. “Is something on the roof?”

A thud shook the line, so heavy it made my mom gasp. Then a shriek—not human, something high and chittering.

A window shattered. A massive, bursting crunch, like something had come straight through the wall.

Then the screams started.

Not just screams of fear. These were sounds of pure, physical terror. Kiana’s high-pitched shriek cut off into a gurgle. Nico wailed, “Mommy!” before his voice was swallowed by a thick, wet thud and a crash of furniture.

“NO! GET AWAY FROM THEM!” My mom’s voice was raw, a warrior’s cry. I heard a grunt of effort, the smash of something heavy—maybe a lamp, a chair—connecting, followed by a hiss that was absolutely not human.

Tasha was cursing, a stream of furious, slurred shouts. There was a scuffle, then a body hitting the floor.

“ROEN!” My mom screamed my name into the phone. It was the last clear word.

A final, piercing shriek was cut short. Then a heavy, dragging sound. 

The line hissed with empty static for three heartbeats.

Then it went dead.

The car tore around the last bend. The cabin came into view, every window blazing with light. The front door was gone. Just a dark, open hole.

I slammed on the brakes, the car skidding to a stop fifty yards away.

The car was still ticking when I killed the engine. 
Maya grabbed my arm. “Roen. Don’t.”

I pulled free. My legs felt numb, like they didn’t belong to me anymore, but they still moved. Every step toward the house felt wrong, like I was walking into a memory that hadn’t happened yet.

The ground between us and the cabin was torn up—deep gouges in the dirt, snapped branches, something dragged straight through the yard. The porch was half gone. The roof sagged in the middle like it had been stepped on.

We desperately called our family’s names. But some part of me already knew no one would answer.
The inside smelled wrong. Something metallic and burnt.

The living room barely looked like a room anymore. Furniture smashed flat. Walls cracked. Blood everywhere—smeared, sprayed, soaked into the carpet so dark it almost looked black. Bodies were scattered where people had been standing or running.

Jay was closest to the door. Or what was left of him. His body lay twisted at an angle that didn’t make sense, like he’d been thrown. 

Bri was near the hallway. She was facedown, drowned in her own blood. One arm stretched out like she’d been reaching for someone. Malik was farther back, slumped against the wall, eyes open but empty, throat cut clean. 

Tasha was near the kitchen. Or what was left of her. Her torso was slashed open, ribs visible through torn fabric. Her head was missing. One hand was clenched around a broken bottle, like she’d tried to fight back even when it was already over.

Maya dropped to her knees.

“No, mommy, no…” she said. Over and over. 

I kept moving because if I stopped, I wasn’t sure I’d start again.

My hands were shaking so bad I had to press them into my jeans to steady myself.

“Mom,” I called out, even though I already knew.

The back room was crushed inward like something heavy had landed there.

Mom was on the floor. I knew it was her because she was curled around a smaller body.

Kiana was inside her arms, turned into my mom’s chest. Her head was gone. Just a ragged stump at her neck, soaked dark. My mom’s face was frozen mid-scream, eyes wide, mouth open, teeth bared.

I couldn’t breathe. My chest locked up, and for a second I thought I might pass out standing there.
I dropped to my knees anyway.

“I’m sorry,” I said. To both of them. To all of them. Like it might still matter.

Then, something moved.

Not the house settling. Not the wind. This was close. Wet. Fast.

I snapped my head toward the hallway and backed up on instinct, almost slipping in blood. My heart was hammering so hard it felt like it was shaking my teeth loose.

“Maya,” I said, low and sharp. “Get up. Something’s still here.”

She sucked in a breath like she’d been punched and scrambled to her feet, eyes wild. I looked around for anything that wasn’t broken or nailed down.

That’s when I saw my mom’s hand.

Tucked against her wrist, half-hidden by her sleeve, was a revolver. The snub‑nose she kept buried in the back of the closet “just in case.” I’d seen it once, years ago, when she thought my dad was coming back drunk and angry.

I knelt and pried it free, gently, like she might still feel it.

The gun was warm.

I flipped the cylinder open with shaking fingers. Five loaded chambers. One spent casing.

“She got a shot off,” I whispered. 

Maya was already moving. She grabbed a bat leaning against the wall near the tree—aluminum, cheap, still wrapped with a torn bow. Jay’s Christmas present. She peeled the plastic off and took a stance like she’d done this before.

The thing scuttled out of the hallway on all fours, moving with a broken, jerky grace. It was all wrong—a patchwork of fur and leathery skin, twisted horns, and eyes that burned like wet matches. It was big, shoulders hunched low to clear the ceiling. And on its flank, a raw, blackened crater wept thick, tar-like blood. My mom’s shot.

Our eyes met. Its jaws unhinged with a sound like cracking ice.

It charged.

I didn’t think. I raised the revolver and pulled the trigger. The first blast was deafening in the shattered room. It hit the thing in the chest, barely slowing it. I fired again. And again. The shots were too fast, my aim wild. I saw chunks of it jerk away. One shot took a piece of its ear. Another sparked off a horn.
It was on me.

The smell hit—old blood and wet earth. A claw swiped, ripping my jacket.

That’s when the bat connected.

Maya swung from the side with everything she had. The aluminum thwanged against its knee. Something cracked. The creature buckled. She swung again, a two-handed blow to its ribs. Another sickening crunch.

The creature turned on her, giving me its side. I jammed the barrel of the pistol into its ribcase and fired the last round point-blank. The thing let out a shriek of pure agony.

The creature reeled back, a spray of dark fluid gushing from the new hole in its side. It hissed, legs buckling beneath it. It took a step forward and collapsed hard, one hand clawing at the floor like it still wanted to fight. 

I stood there with the revolver hanging useless in my hand, ears ringing, lungs barely working. My jacket, my hands, my face—everything was slick with its blood. Thick, black, warm. It dripped off my fingers and splattered onto the wrecked floor like oil.

I couldn’t move. My brain felt unplugged. Like if I stayed perfectly still, none of this would be real.

“Roen.” Maya’s voice sounded far away. Then closer. “Roen—look at me.”

I didn’t.

She grabbed my wrists hard. Her hands were shaking worse than mine. “Hey. Hey. We have to go. Right now.”

I blinked. My eyes burned. “My mom… Kiana…”

“I know, babe,” she said, voice cracking but steady anyway. “But we can’t stay here.”

Something deep in me fought that. Screamed at me to stay. To do something. To not leave them like this. 

Maya tugged me toward the door. I let her.

We stumbled out into the cold night, slipping in the torn-up dirt. The air hit my face and I sucked it in like I’d been underwater too long. The sky above the cabin was alive.

Shapes moved across it—dark figures lifting off from the ground, rising in spirals and lines, mounting beasts that shouldn’t exist. Antlers. Wings. Too many legs. Too many eyes. The sound came back, clearer now: bells, laughter, howling wind.

They rose over the treeline in a long, crooked procession, silhouettes cutting across the moon. And at the front of it—
I stopped dead.

The sleigh floated higher than the rest, massive and ornate, pulled by creatures that looked like reindeer only in the loosest sense. Their bodies were stretched wrong, ribs showing through skin, eyes glowing like coals.

At the reins stood him.

Tall. Broad. Wrapped in red that looked stained in blood. His beard hung in clumps, matted and dark. His smile was too wide, teeth too many. A crown of antlers rose from his head, tangled with bells that rang wrong—deep, warped.

He reached down into the sleigh, grabbed something that kicked and screamed, and hauled it up by the arm.

Nico.

My brother thrashed, crying, his small hands clawing at the edge of the sleigh. I saw his face clearly in the firelight—terror, confusion, mouth open as he screamed my name.

“NO!” I tried to run. Maya wrapped her arms around my chest and hauled me back with everything she had.

The figure laughed. A deep, booming sound that echoed through the trees and into my bones. He shoved Nico headfirst into a bulging sack already writhing with movement—other kids, other screams—then tied it shut like it was nothing.

The sleigh lurched forward.The procession surged after it, riders whooping and shrieking as they climbed into the sky. 

Something dragged itself out of the cabin behind us.

The wounded creature. The one we thought was dead.

It staggered on three limbs, leaving a thick trail of blood across the porch and into the dirt. It let out a broken, furious cry and launched itself forward as the sleigh passed overhead.

Its claws caught the back rail of the sleigh. It slammed into the side hard, dangling there, legs kicking uselessly as the procession carried it upward. Blood sprayed out behind it in a long, dark arc, raining down through the trees.

For a few seconds, it hung on. Dragged. Refused to let go.
Then its grip failed.

The creature fell.

It vanished into the forest below with a distant, wet crash that echoed once and then went silent.

The sleigh didn’t slow.

The Santa thing threw his head back and laughed again, louder this time, like the sound itself was a victory. Then the hunt disappeared into the clouds, the bells fading until there was nothing left but wind and ruined trees and the broken shell of the cabin behind us.

—

We just sat down in the dirt a few yards from the cabin and held onto each other like if we let go, one of us would disappear too.

I don’t know how long it was. Long enough for the cold to stop mattering. Long enough for my hands to go numb around Maya’s jacket. Long enough for my brain to start doing this stupid thing where it kept trying to rewind, like maybe I’d missed a moment where I could’ve done something different.

It was Maya who finally remembered the phone.

“Roen,” she said, voice hoarse. “We have to call the police….”

My hands shook so bad I dropped my phone twice before I managed to unlock the screen. There was dried blood in the cracks of the case. I dialed 911 and put it on speaker because I didn’t trust myself to hold it.

The dispatcher’s voice was calm. Too calm.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

—

The cops showed up fast. Faster than I expected. Two cruisers at first, then more. Red and blue lights flooded the trees like some messed-up holiday display.

They separated us immediately.

Hands up. On your knees. Don’t move.

I remember one of them staring at my jacket, at the black blood smeared down my arms, and his hand never left his gun.

They asked us what happened. Over and over. Separately. Same questions, different words.

I told them there were things in the house. I told them they killed everyone. I told them they weren't human.

That was the exact moment their faces changed.

Not fear. Not concern.

Suspicion.

They cuffed my hands. Maya’s too. 

At first, they tried to pin it on me. Or maybe both of us. Kept pressing like we were hiding something, like maybe there was a fight that got out of hand, or we snapped, or it was drugs. Asked where I dumped Nico’s body.

One of the detectives took the revolver out of an evidence bag and set it on the table of the interrogation room like it was a point he’d been waiting to make.

“So you fired this?”

“Yes,” I said. “At the thing.”

“What thing?”

I looked at him. “The thing that killed my family.”

He wrote something down and nodded like that explained everything.

When the forensics team finally showed up and started putting the scene together, it got harder to make it stick. The blood patterns, the way the bodies were torn apart—none of it made sense for a standard attack. Way too violent. Way too messy. Too many injuries that didn’t line up with the weapons they found. No human did that. No animal either, far as they could tell. But they sure as hell weren’t going to write “mythical sky monsters” in the report.

Next theory? My dad.

But he was still locked up. Solid alibi. The detectives even visited him in prison to personally make sure he was still there. 
After that, they looked at Rick. Tasha’s boyfriend. Only problem? They found him too. What was left of him, anyway. His body was found near the front yard, slumped against a tree. Neck snapped like a twig.

That’s when they got quiet. No more hard questions. Just forms. Statements. A counselor.

We were minors. No surviving family. That part was simple.
Child Protect Services got involved.

They wanted to split us up. Said it was temporary, just until they could sort everything out. I got assigned a group home in Clovis. Maya got somewhere in Madera.

—

The day they told me I was getting moved, I didn’t even argue. There wasn’t any fight left. Just this empty numbness that settled behind my ribs and stayed there. The caseworker—Janine or Jenna or something—told me the social worker wanted to talk before the transfer. I figured it was some last-minute paperwork thing.

Instead, they walked me into this windowless office and shut the door behind me.

Maya was already there.

She looked as rough as I felt—pale, shadows under her baby-blue eyes. When she saw me, she blinked like she wasn’t sure I was real. We just stood there for a second.

Then she crossed the room and hugged me so hard it hurt.
I held on. Didn’t say anything. Couldn’t.

“Hey,” she said into my shoulder. Her voice shook once. “Hey,” I replied.

“I thought they sent you away already,” I said.

“Almost,” she said. “Guess we got a delay.”

We pulled apart when someone cleared their throat.

I looked up to see a woman already in the room, standing near the wall.

She was in her late thirties, maybe. She didn’t look like a social worker I’d ever seen. Didn’t smell like stale coffee or exhaustion. Black blazer and jeans. Her dark brown hair was cropped short and neat. Her hazel eyes were sharp, measuring, like she was sizing up threats.

She closed the door behind her.

“I’m glad you two got a moment to catch up,” she said calmly. “Please, sit.”

“My name is Agent Sara Benoit,” she said.

The woman waited until we were seated before she spoke again. She didn’t rush it. Let the silence stretch just long enough to feel intentional.

“I know you’ve already talked to the police,” she said. “Multiple times.”

I let out a short, tired laugh. “Then why are we here again?”
She looked at me directly. Not through me. Not like I was a problem to solve. “Because I’m not with the police.”

Maya stiffened beside me. I felt it through her sleeve.

I said, “So what? You’re a shrink? This is where you tell us we’re crazy, right?”

Benoit shook her head. “No. This is where I tell you I believe you.”

That landed heavier than any I’d heard so far.

I stared at her. “You… what?”

“I believe there was something non-human involved in the killings at that cabin,” she said. Flat. Like she was reading off a weather report. “I believe what you saw in the sky was real. And I believe the entity you described—what the media will eventually call an animal or a cult or a psychotic break—is none of those things.”

The room was quiet except for the hum of the lights.

Maya spoke up. “They said we were traumatized. That our minds filled in the gaps.”

Benoit nodded. “That’s what they have to say. It keeps things neat.”

That pissed me off more than anything else she could’ve said.

“Neat? I saw my family slaughtered,” I said. My voice stayed level, but it took work. “I watched something dressed like evil Santa kidnap my brother . If you’re about to tell me to move on, don’t.”

Benoit didn’t flinch.

“I’m not here to tell you that,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that what took your brother isn’t untouchable. And what killed your family doesn’t get to walk away clean.”

My chest tightened. Maya’s fingers found mine under the table and locked on.

I shook my head. “The fuck can you do about it? What are you? FBI? CIA? Some Men in Black knockoff with worse suits?”

She smirked at my jab, then reached into her blazer slowly, deliberately, like she didn’t want us to think she was pulling a weapon. She flipped open a leather badge wallet and slid it across the table.

‘NORAD
 Special Investigations Division’

The seal was real. The badge was heavy. Government ugly. No flair.

“…NORAD?” I said. “What’s that?”

“North American Aerospace Defense Command,” she explained. “Officially, we track airspace. Missiles. Unidentified aircraft. Anything that crosses borders where it shouldn’t.”

“What the hell does fucking NORAD want with us?” I demanded.

Benoit didn’t flinch. She just stated, “I’m here to offer you a choice.”

“A choice?” Maya asked.

She nodded. “Option one: you go to group homes, therapy, court dates. You try to live with what you saw. The official story will be ‘unknown assailants’ and ‘tragic circumstances.’ Your brother will be listed as deceased once the paperwork catches up.”

My chest burned. “And the other option?”

“Option two,” she said, her voice low and steady, “you come with me. You disappear on paper. New names, new files. You train with us. You learn what these things are, and how to kill them. Then you find the ones who did this. You get your brother back, and you make them pay.”

I started wondering about it more recently because I began doing freelance work online, and they recommended using a VPN when accessing client tools and email. On top of that, I am often connected to public Wi Fi in coffee shops and hotels, which makes me nervous about someone snooping on my data.

Hey everyone. I’m 33 and born and raised in Michigan. I’ve never really posted here before, but I’m trying to branch out and meet new people to chat with, vibe with, and hopefully build some simple, genuine connections.

A little about me:
I’m big into anything outdoors when the weather’s good like  hiking, kayaking, camping, all that good stuff. Once winter hits though, I fully switch into homebody mode. Give me reading, good coffee, TV show binges, and warm cuddles with the right person and I’m set.

I’m a friendly, laid back guy who can get pretty goofy once I’m comfortable. I love sarcasm and I’m always down for good conversation, whether it’s light, funny, or deeper “talk for hours” type stuff.

If you’re looking for someone to chat with, get to know, share random thoughts with, or just build a chill friendship, feel free to message me.

When dad got locked up again, it didn’t hit right away. He’d been in and out since I was nine, but this time felt different. Longer sentence. Something about assault with a weapon and parole violations. My mom, Marisol, cried once, then shut down completely. No yelling, no last minute plea to judge for leniency—just silence.

“He’s going away for at least fifteen years.”

It wasn’t news. We all knew. I’d heard her crying about it on the phone to my grandma in the Philippines through the paper-thin wall. My little sister, Kiana heard it too but didn’t say anything. Just curled up on the mattress with his headphones on, pretending she couldn’t. 

Then mom couldn’t make rent. The landlord came by with that fake sympathy, like he felt bad but not bad enough to wait one more week for rent before evicting us. 

Our house in Fresno was one of those old stucco duplexes with mold in the vents and a broken front fence. Still, it was home. 

“We’ll get a fresh start,” Mom said.

And by “fresh start,” she meant a cabin in the Sierra Nevada that looked cheap even in blurry online photos. The only reason it was so affordable was because another family—who was somehow even worse off than we were—was willing to split the cost. We’d “make it work.” Whatever that meant.

I packed my clothes in trash bags. My baby brother, Nico, clutched his PS4 the whole time like someone was gonna steal it. Mom sold the washer and our living room couch for gas money.

When we finally pulled up, the place wasn’t a cabin so much as a box with windows. The woods pressed tight around it like the trees wanted to swallow it whole.

“Looks haunted,” I muttered, stepping out of the car and staring at the place. It had a sagging roof, moss creeping up one side, and a screen door that hung off one hinge like it gave up trying years ago.

Nico’s face scrunched up. “Haunted? For real?”

I shrugged. “Guess we’ll find out tonight.”

“We will?” He whispers.

Mom shot me that look. “Seriously, Roen?” she snapped. “You think this is funny? No, baby, it’s not haunted.” She reassured Nico.

I swung one of the trash bags over my shoulder and headed for the front door. The steps creaked loud under my feet, like even they weren’t sure they could hold me. Just as I reached for the knob—
I heard voices. Two people inside, arguing loud enough that I didn’t need to strain to catch it.

“I’m not sharing a room with some random people, Mom!” Said a girl’s voice. 

A second voice fired back, older, calmer but tight with frustration. “Maya, we’ve been over this. We don’t have a choice.”

Then I heard footsteps—fast ones, heavy and pissed off, thudding through the cabin toward the door.

Before I could move out of the way or even say anything, the front door flung open hard—right into me. The edge caught me square in the shoulder and chest, knocking the air out of me as I stumbled backward and landed flat on the porch with a loud thump.

“Shit,” I muttered, wincing.

A shadow filled the doorway. I looked up and there she was—the girl, standing over me with wide eyes and a face full of panic.

“Oh my god—I didn’t see you,” she said, breathless. “Are you okay? I didn’t—God, I’m sorry.”

She knelt down a little, hand halfway out like she wasn’t sure if she should help me up or if she’d already done enough damage.

I sat up, rubbing my ribs and trying not to look like it actually hurt as bad as it did. “Yeah,” I grunted. “I mean, it’s just a screen door. Not like it was made of steel or anything.”

I grabbed her outstretched hand. Her grip was stronger than I expected, but her fingers trembled a little.

She looked about my age—sixteen, maybe seventeen—with this messy blonde braid half falling apart and a hoodie that looked like it had been through a few too many wash cycles. Her nails were painted black, chipped down to the corners. She didn’t let go of my hand right away.

Her face changed fast. Like something hot in her just shut off the second our eyes locked. The sharp edge drained out of her expression, like she forgot what she was mad about.

“I didn’t know anyone was standing out here,” she said again, softer this time. “I just... needed air.”

“It’s all good,” I said, brushing dirt off my jeans and trying to gather my spilled stuff. “Not my first time getting knocked down today.”

She glanced awkwardly back inside. “So... guess that means you’re the people we’re sharing this dump with?”

“Yup. The other half of the broke brigade.”

She held out her hand. “I’m Maya.”

I took it. “Roen.”

“Let me guess…say you’re here because of someone else’s screw-up.”

“How’s you know?” I asked surprised.

She shrugged. “Let’s just say you’re not the only one.” 

Behind me, Nico whispered, “Is she a ghost?”

Maya raised an eyebrow. “Who's that?”

“My brother. He’s eight. He’s gonna ask a million questions, so get ready.”

She smirked. “Bring it on. I’ve survived worse.”
I believed her.

Kiana was already climbing out of the car, dragging her own trash bag behind her, when she caught sight of me and Maya still talking.

“Ohhh,” she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, drawing out the sound with a stupid grin. “Roen’s already got a girlfriend in the woods.”

I rolled my eyes. “Shut up, Kiana.”

Maya snorted but didn’t say anything, just crossed her arms and waited like she was curious how this was gonna play out.

“I’m just saying,” she whispered, “you’ve known her for like two minutes and you’re already helping each other off the porch like it’s a rom-com.”

“You’re not even supposed to know what that is.”
“I’m twelve, not dumb.”

“She’s cute,” Kiana added, smirking now as she walked past. “Y’all gonna braid each other’s hair later?”

“I swear to god—”

“Language,” Mom chided from behind me. 

Before I could fire back, the front door creaked open again, and a woman stepped out. Thin, wiry frame. She wore a faded flannel and sweatpants like she’d stopped trying to impress anyone years ago. Her eyes darted across us—counting, maybe—and her smile didn’t quite reach all the way up.

“You must be the Mayumis,” she said. Her voice was raspy, probably from too many cigarettes or too many bad nights. Maybe both. “I’m Tasha. Tasha Foster.”

She stepped closer, and the smell hit me—sharp and bitter. Whiskey. 

Mom appeared behind us just in time. “Hi, I’m Marisol,” she said quietly, arms crossed like she already regretted every decision that led us here.

They hugged briefly. More of a press of shoulders than a real embrace. Tasha nodded toward the cabin. “We’re tight on space, but we cleared out the back room. Me, you, and the girls can take that. The boys can have the den.”

“Boys?” I asked, stepping into the doorway and immediately getting swarmed by noise.

Inside, it looked like someone tried to clean but gave up halfway through. There were dishes drying on one side of the sink, and unfolded laundry piled on the couch. A crusty pizza box sat on the counter next to an open bottle of something that definitely wasn’t juice.

Then came the thundering feet—three of them. First was a chubby kid with wild curls and a superhero shirt that was two sizes too small. He stopped, blinked at us, then just yelled, “New people!”

A girl around Kiana’s age followed, hair in tight braids and a glare that said she didn’t trust any of us. Behind her was a tall, lanky boy with headphones around his neck and that look teens get when they’re stuck somewhere they hate.

Maya rolled her eyes. “These are my siblings. That loud one’s Jay, the girl with the death stare is Bri, and the quiet one’s Malik.”

Jay darted toward Nico immediately, pointing at the PS4. “You got games?!”

Nico lit up. “A bunch.”

Mom and Tasha slipped into the kitchen to talk in low voices while the rest of us stood there in this weird moment of strangers under one roof. 

Maya looked around at the chaos. “So… welcome to the party.”

“Some party,” I muttered, but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth.

Kiana elbowed me. “I like it here,” she said.

—

Starting a new school in the middle of the year is trash. No one tells you where anything is, teachers already have favorites, and everybody’s locked into their little cliques like they’re afraid being friendly’s contagious.

Maya and I ended up in the same homeroom, which helped. It was the only part of the day that didn’t feel like I was walking into someone else’s house uninvited. She sat two rows over at first, headphones in, scribbling in the margins of a beat-up copy of The Bell Jar. I didn’t even know she read stuff like that.

We got paired up in Physics too—lab partners. I’m more of the “just tell me what to do and I’ll do it” type when it comes to school. I play ball. Football mostly, but I’m decent at track. Maya actually liked the subject. Asked questions. Took notes like they meant something. The first week, I thought we’d hate working together—like she’d think I was an idiot or something—but it wasn’t like that. She explained things without making it weird. 

She’d let me copy her answers—but only after I tried to understand them first.

At lunch, she sat outside under the trees near the side parking lot. Alone at first. I started joining her, ditching my usual spot with the guys.

I soon found out why she kept to herself. It started small. A few whispers behind cupped hands, little laughs when Maya walked past in the hallway. She didn’t react at first, just rolled her eyes and kept walking. But I saw the tightness in her jaw. The way her grip on her backpack straps got a little firmer.

Then one day, someone didn’t bother whispering.

The comments started behind her back—“Isn’t she the one with the crackhead mom?”, “Heard she’s got, like, four half-siblings. All different dads.” 

I felt Maya tense beside me. Not flinch—just go still, like something inside her snapped into place. She didn’t say anything. Didn’t even look at them. She just turned and walked fast, then faster, then she was running down the hall.

“Yo,” I called after her, but she was already gone.
I spun back to the group gossiping. 

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I snapped. Heads turned. Good. 

One of the guys laughed. “Relax, man. It’s just facts.”

“Facts?” I stepped closer. “You don’t know shit about her.”

The girl rolled her eyes. “She’s gonna end up just like her mom anyway. Everyone knows that.”

“Oh fuck off!” I shouted. I didn’t wait. I took off after Maya.

I checked the bathroom first. Empty. Then the quad. Nothing. My last period bell rang, but I didn’t care. I headed to the library because it was the only quiet place left in this school.

She was tucked into the far back corner, half-hidden behind the tall shelves nobody ever went to. Sitting on the floor. Knees pulled in. Hoodie sleeve pushed up.

My stomach dropped.

“Maya,” I said, low. Careful.

She didn’t look up.

I took a few slow steps closer and saw it—the razor in her hand. 

Her arm was a roadmap of old lines. Some faded. Some not.

“Hey,” I said, softer now. “Don’t.”

Her hand paused.

“You’re not allowed to say that,” she muttered. Her voice was wrecked. “You don’t get to stop me.”

“I know,” I said. “But I’m asking anyway.”

She laughed once, sharp and ugly. “They’re right, you know. About me. About all of it.”

I crouched down in front of her, keeping my hands where she could see them. “They don’t know you.”

“They know enough,” she said. “My mom’s an addict. She disappears for days. Sometimes weeks. We all got different dads. None of them stuck. People hear that and they already got my ending figured out.”

“You’re not,” I said.

She lifted the razor slightly. “You don’t know that.”

She finally looked at me. Her blue eyes were red, furious, tired. “You think I don’t see it? I’m already halfway there.”

I swallowed. “I know what it’s like when everyone assumes you’re trash because of who raised you.”
That got her attention.

“My dad’s been locked up most of my life,” I said. “I’ve got scars too.” I tapped my knuckles. Old marks. “From standing up to him when I shouldn’t have. From thinking I could fix things if I just tried harder.”
She stared at my hands like she was seeing them for the first time.

“I used to think if I didn’t fight back, I’d turn into him,” I went on. “Turns out, fighting him didn’t make me better either. Just made everything louder.”

Her grip on the razor loosened a little.

I reached out slowly. “Can you give me that?”

She hesitated. Long enough that my heart was pounding in my ears. Then she dropped the razor into my palm like it weighed a thousand pounds.

She covered her face and finally broke.

I stayed there. Didn’t try to fix it. Didn’t say the wrong hopeful crap. Just sat on the library floor with her while she cried it out.

—
​​That night, I knocked on Maya’s door after everyone had crashed.

“I have an idea,” I whispered. “It’s mean though…”
Maya smirked. “The meaner the better.”

That morning, we showed up to school early. We had backpacks full of supplies—a screwdriver, glitter, expired sardines, and four tiny tubes of industrial-strength superglue.

We snuck into the locker hallway when the janitor went for his smoke break. Maya kept lookout while I unscrewed the hinges on three locker doors—each one belonging to the worst of the trash-talkers. We laced the inside edges with glue, so when they slammed shut like usual, they’d stay that way. 

Inside one of them, we left a glitter bomb rigged to pop the second the door opened. In another, Maya stuffed the expired sardines into a pencil pouch and superglued that shut too. The smell would hit like a punch in the face.

We barely made it to homeroom before the chaos started.

First period: screaming from the hallway. Second period: a janitor with bolt cutters. By third period, the whole school was buzzing.

And then we got called to the office.

We got caught on cameras. Of course. We didn’t even try to lie. Just sat there while the vice principal read us the suspension notice like he was personally offended.

“Three days. Home. No extracurriculars. You’re lucky we’re not calling the police.”

Outside the office, Maya bumped my shoulder. “Worth it?”

I grinned. “Every second.”

—

I got my permit that November. Mom let me borrow the car sometimes, mostly because she was too tired to argue. We made it count—gas station dinners, thrift store photo shoots, late-night drives to nowhere.

We’d sneak out some nights just to lie in the truck bed and stare at the stars through the trees, counting satellites and pretending they were escape pods.

The first time she kissed me, it wasn’t planned. We were sitting in the school parking lot, waiting for the rain to let up. She just looked over and said, “I’m gonna do something stupid,” then leaned in before I could ask what. After that, it all moved fast.

The first time we had sex was in the back of the car, parked on an old forestry road, all fumbling hands and held breath. We thought we were careful.

The scare happened two weeks later. A late period, a pregnancy test from the pharmacy. The longest three minutes of our lives, standing in that cabin’s moldy bathroom, waiting. When it was negative, we didn’t celebrate. She laughed. I almost cried.

After that, we thought more about the future. Maya started talking about college more. Somewhere far. I didn’t have plans like that, but I was working weekends at the pizza shop, and started saving. Not for clothes or games—just for getting out. 

—

By December, things settled down a bit. We tried to make the best of the holidays. All month, the cabin smelled like pine and mildew and cheap cinnamon candles. We’d managed to scrape together some decorations—paper snowflakes, a string of busted lights that only half worked, and a sad fake tree we found at the thrift store for five bucks. Nico hung plastic ornaments like it was the real deal. Kiana made hot cocoa from a dollar store mix and forced everyone to drink it. Mom even smiled a few times, though it never lasted.

Maya and I did our part. Helped the little kids wrap presents in newspaper. Made jokes about how Santa probably skipped our cabin because the GPS gave up halfway up the mountain. 

Even Tasha seemed mellow for once.

But then Christmas Eve hit. 

Maya’s mom announced that afternoon she was inviting her new boyfriend over for dinner. Some dude named Rick or Rich or something. Maya went quiet first, then full-on exploded.

“You’re kidding, right?” she snapped. “You’re really bringing some random guy here? On Christmas Eve?”

Tasha shrugged like it was no big deal. “He’s not random. I’ve known him for months.”

“And that makes it fucking okay? And now we’re supposed to play happy family?”

“Watch your mouth.”

“Or what? You’ll vanish for a week and pretend this never happened?”

Tasha lit a cigarette inside the house, which she only did when she was mad. “It’s my house, Maya. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”

Maya laughed. “Gladly.”

She grabbed her bag and was out the door before I could say anything. I followed.

We sat on the steps while the cold settled into our bones. She didn’t talk. Just stared out at the trees, fists clenched in her lap like she was holding herself together by force. I leaned over, bumped her shoulder.

“Let’s bounce.”

She looked at me. “Where?""

“Anywhere but here.”

So we sneaked out. I borrowed Mom’s car.

We drove up to a dirt road, way up past the ranger station, where the trees cleared and gave you this wide, unreal view of the valley below. You could see for miles.

I popped the trunk, and we sat with our legs hanging out the back, wrapped in a blanket. I pulled out the six-pack I’d stashed—some knockoff lager from that corner store near school that never asked questions. Maya lit a joint she’d swiped from her mom’s stash and passed it to me without saying anything.

We just sat there, knees touching, sipping beer and smoking the joint, watching our breath cloud up in the freezing air. Maya played music off her phone, low. Some old indie Christmas playlist she’d downloaded for the irony.

At one point, she leaned her head on my shoulder.

“Thanks,” she whispered.

“For what?”

“For giving me something that doesn’t suck.”

—

Maya was humming some half-forgotten carol when I noticed it—this streak of light cutting across the night sky, low and fast. At first I thought it was just a shooting star, but it didn’t fizzle out like it was supposed to. It curved. Like it was changing direction. Like it knew where it was going.

“Did you see that?” I asked.

She lifted her head. “What?”

I pointed. “That...”

Maya squinted. “What am I supposed to be looking at?”
I fumbled the binoculars from the glovebox—old ones my uncle gave me for spotting deer. I raised them to my eyes.

I held them up so that Maya could see too, adjusted the focus, and froze.

Maya noticed right away. “What? What is it?”

Through the binoculars, there were figures—too many to count, all of them fast. Not like planes. More like shadows ripping across the sky, riding... something. Horses, maybe. Or things shaped like horses but wrong. Twisted. And riders—tall, thin figures wrapped in cloaks that whipped in the wind, some with skull faces, some with no faces at all. Weapons glinted in their hands. Swords. Spears. Chains.

“Oh. No,” Maya whispered. 

“What is it?” I asked.

She looked at me. “It’s heading towards the cabin.”

I snatched the binoculars back, my hands shaking so hard the image blurred. It took me three tries to steady them against my face.

She was right.

The things weren’t just in the sky anymore. They were descending, a dark wave pouring down the tree line toward the base of the mountain. Toward our road. Toward the cabin.

“We have to go. Now.” 

We scrambled into the car. I spun the tires in the dirt, wrenching the wheel toward home. The headlights carved a shaky path through the dark as we flew down the mountain road, branches slapping the windshield.
“Call my mom,” I told Maya, handing my phone to her. 
“Put it on speaker.”
The ringing seemed to last forever. Mom picked up.

“Roen? Where are you? Where’s the car?” The anger was a live wire.

“Mom, listen! You have to get everyone inside. Lock the doors. Right now.”

“What are you talking about? Are you in trouble?”

“Mom, no! Listen! There’s something coming. From the sky. We saw it. It’s coming down the mountain toward the cabin.”

A beat of dead silence. Then her tone, cold and disbelieving. “Have you been doing drugs? Is Maya with you?”

“Mom, I swear to God, I’m… Please, just look outside. Go to a window and look up toward the ridge.”

“I’m looking, Roen. I don’t see anything but trees and…” She trailed off. I heard a faint, distant sound through the phone, like bells, but twisted and metallic. “What is that noise?”

Then, Nico’s voice, excited in the background. “Mom! Mom! Look! It’s Santa’s sleigh! I see the lights!”

Kiana joined in. “Whoa! Are those reindeer?”

“Kids, get back from the window,” Mom said, but her voice had changed. The anger was gone, replaced by a slow-dawning confusion. The bells were louder now, mixed with a sound like wind tearing through a canyon.

“Mom, it’s NOT Santa!” I was yelling, my foot pressing the accelerator to the floor. The car fishtailed on a gravel curve. “Get everyone and run into the woods! Now!”

The line went quiet for one second too long. Not dead quiet—I could hear the muffled rustle of the phone in my mom’s hand, a sharp intake of breath.

Then the sounds started.

Not bells anymore. Something lower, a grinding hum that vibrated through the phone speaker. It was followed by a skittering, scraping noise, like claws on slate, getting closer. Fast.

“Marisol?” Tasha’s voice, distant and confused. “Is something on the roof?”

A thud shook the line, so heavy it made my mom gasp. Then a shriek—not human, something high and chittering.

A window shattered. A massive, bursting crunch, like something had come straight through the wall.

Then the screams started.

Not just screams of fear. These were sounds of pure, physical terror. Kiana’s high-pitched shriek cut off into a gurgle. Nico wailed, “Mommy!” before his voice was swallowed by a thick, wet thud and a crash of furniture.

“NO! GET AWAY FROM THEM!” My mom’s voice was raw, a warrior’s cry. I heard a grunt of effort, the smash of something heavy—maybe a lamp, a chair—connecting, followed by a hiss that was absolutely not human.

Tasha was cursing, a stream of furious, slurred shouts. There was a scuffle, then a body hitting the floor.

“ROEN!” My mom screamed my name into the phone. It was the last clear word.

A final, piercing shriek was cut short. Then a heavy, dragging sound. 

The line hissed with empty static for three heartbeats.

Then it went dead.

The car tore around the last bend. The cabin came into view, every window blazing with light. The front door was gone. Just a dark, open hole.

I slammed on the brakes, the car skidding to a stop fifty yards away.

The car was still ticking when I killed the engine. 
Maya grabbed my arm. “Roen. Don’t.”

I pulled free. My legs felt numb, like they didn’t belong to me anymore, but they still moved. Every step toward the house felt wrong, like I was walking into a memory that hadn’t happened yet.

The ground between us and the cabin was torn up—deep gouges in the dirt, snapped branches, something dragged straight through the yard. The porch was half gone. The roof sagged in the middle like it had been stepped on.

We desperately called our family’s names. But some part of me already knew no one would answer.
The inside smelled wrong. Something metallic and burnt.

The living room barely looked like a room anymore. Furniture smashed flat. Walls cracked. Blood everywhere—smeared, sprayed, soaked into the carpet so dark it almost looked black. Bodies were scattered where people had been standing or running.

Jay was closest to the door. Or what was left of him. His body lay twisted at an angle that didn’t make sense, like he’d been thrown. 

Bri was near the hallway. She was facedown, drowned in her own blood. One arm stretched out like she’d been reaching for someone. Malik was farther back, slumped against the wall, eyes open but empty, throat cut clean. 

Tasha was near the kitchen. Or what was left of her. Her torso was slashed open, ribs visible through torn fabric. Her head was missing. One hand was clenched around a broken bottle, like she’d tried to fight back even when it was already over.

Maya dropped to her knees.

“No, mommy, no…” she said. Over and over. 

I kept moving because if I stopped, I wasn’t sure I’d start again.

My hands were shaking so bad I had to press them into my jeans to steady myself.

“Mom,” I called out, even though I already knew.

The back room was crushed inward like something heavy had landed there.

Mom was on the floor. I knew it was her because she was curled around a smaller body.

Kiana was inside her arms, turned into my mom’s chest. Her head was gone. Just a ragged stump at her neck, soaked dark. My mom’s face was frozen mid-scream, eyes wide, mouth open, teeth bared.

I couldn’t breathe. My chest locked up, and for a second I thought I might pass out standing there.
I dropped to my knees anyway.

“I’m sorry,” I said. To both of them. To all of them. Like it might still matter.

Then, something moved.

Not the house settling. Not the wind. This was close. Wet. Fast.

I snapped my head toward the hallway and backed up on instinct, almost slipping in blood. My heart was hammering so hard it felt like it was shaking my teeth loose.

“Maya,” I said, low and sharp. “Get up. Something’s still here.”

She sucked in a breath like she’d been punched and scrambled to her feet, eyes wild. I looked around for anything that wasn’t broken or nailed down.

That’s when I saw my mom’s hand.

Tucked against her wrist, half-hidden by her sleeve, was a revolver. The snub‑nose she kept buried in the back of the closet “just in case.” I’d seen it once, years ago, when she thought my dad was coming back drunk and angry.

I knelt and pried it free, gently, like she might still feel it.

The gun was warm.

I flipped the cylinder open with shaking fingers. Five loaded chambers. One spent casing.

“She got a shot off,” I whispered. 

Maya was already moving. She grabbed a bat leaning against the wall near the tree—aluminum, cheap, still wrapped with a torn bow. Jay’s Christmas present. She peeled the plastic off and took a stance like she’d done this before.

The thing scuttled out of the hallway on all fours, moving with a broken, jerky grace. It was all wrong—a patchwork of fur and leathery skin, twisted horns, and eyes that burned like wet matches. It was big, shoulders hunched low to clear the ceiling. And on its flank, a raw, blackened crater wept thick, tar-like blood. My mom’s shot.

Our eyes met. Its jaws unhinged with a sound like cracking ice.

It charged.

I didn’t think. I raised the revolver and pulled the trigger. The first blast was deafening in the shattered room. It hit the thing in the chest, barely slowing it. I fired again. And again. The shots were too fast, my aim wild. I saw chunks of it jerk away. One shot took a piece of its ear. Another sparked off a horn.
It was on me.

The smell hit—old blood and wet earth. A claw swiped, ripping my jacket.

That’s when the bat connected.

Maya swung from the side with everything she had. The aluminum thwanged against its knee. Something cracked. The creature buckled. She swung again, a two-handed blow to its ribs. Another sickening crunch.

The creature turned on her, giving me its side. I jammed the barrel of the pistol into its ribcase and fired the last round point-blank. The thing let out a shriek of pure agony.

The creature reeled back, a spray of dark fluid gushing from the new hole in its side. It hissed, legs buckling beneath it. It took a step forward and collapsed hard, one hand clawing at the floor like it still wanted to fight. 

I stood there with the revolver hanging useless in my hand, ears ringing, lungs barely working. My jacket, my hands, my face—everything was slick with its blood. Thick, black, warm. It dripped off my fingers and splattered onto the wrecked floor like oil.

I couldn’t move. My brain felt unplugged. Like if I stayed perfectly still, none of this would be real.

“Roen.” Maya’s voice sounded far away. Then closer. “Roen—look at me.”

I didn’t.

She grabbed my wrists hard. Her hands were shaking worse than mine. “Hey. Hey. We have to go. Right now.”

I blinked. My eyes burned. “My mom… Kiana…”

“I know, babe,” she said, voice cracking but steady anyway. “But we can’t stay here.”

Something deep in me fought that. Screamed at me to stay. To do something. To not leave them like this. 

Maya tugged me toward the door. I let her.

We stumbled out into the cold night, slipping in the torn-up dirt. The air hit my face and I sucked it in like I’d been underwater too long. The sky above the cabin was alive.

Shapes moved across it—dark figures lifting off from the ground, rising in spirals and lines, mounting beasts that shouldn’t exist. Antlers. Wings. Too many legs. Too many eyes. The sound came back, clearer now: bells, laughter, howling wind.

They rose over the treeline in a long, crooked procession, silhouettes cutting across the moon. And at the front of it—
I stopped dead.

The sleigh floated higher than the rest, massive and ornate, pulled by creatures that looked like reindeer only in the loosest sense. Their bodies were stretched wrong, ribs showing through skin, eyes glowing like coals.

At the reins stood him.

Tall. Broad. Wrapped in red that looked stained in blood. His beard hung in clumps, matted and dark. His smile was too wide, teeth too many. A crown of antlers rose from his head, tangled with bells that rang wrong—deep, warped.

He reached down into the sleigh, grabbed something that kicked and screamed, and hauled it up by the arm.

Nico.

My brother thrashed, crying, his small hands clawing at the edge of the sleigh. I saw his face clearly in the firelight—terror, confusion, mouth open as he screamed my name.

“NO!” I tried to run. Maya wrapped her arms around my chest and hauled me back with everything she had.

The figure laughed. A deep, booming sound that echoed through the trees and into my bones. He shoved Nico headfirst into a bulging sack already writhing with movement—other kids, other screams—then tied it shut like it was nothing.

The sleigh lurched forward.The procession surged after it, riders whooping and shrieking as they climbed into the sky. 

Something dragged itself out of the cabin behind us.

The wounded creature. The one we thought was dead.

It staggered on three limbs, leaving a thick trail of blood across the porch and into the dirt. It let out a broken, furious cry and launched itself forward as the sleigh passed overhead.

Its claws caught the back rail of the sleigh. It slammed into the side hard, dangling there, legs kicking uselessly as the procession carried it upward. Blood sprayed out behind it in a long, dark arc, raining down through the trees.

For a few seconds, it hung on. Dragged. Refused to let go.
Then its grip failed.

The creature fell.

It vanished into the forest below with a distant, wet crash that echoed once and then went silent.

The sleigh didn’t slow.

The Santa thing threw his head back and laughed again, louder this time, like the sound itself was a victory. Then the hunt disappeared into the clouds, the bells fading until there was nothing left but wind and ruined trees and the broken shell of the cabin behind us.

—

We just sat down in the dirt a few yards from the cabin and held onto each other like if we let go, one of us would disappear too.

I don’t know how long it was. Long enough for the cold to stop mattering. Long enough for my hands to go numb around Maya’s jacket. Long enough for my brain to start doing this stupid thing where it kept trying to rewind, like maybe I’d missed a moment where I could’ve done something different.

It was Maya who finally remembered the phone.

“Roen,” she said, voice hoarse. “We have to call the police….”

My hands shook so bad I dropped my phone twice before I managed to unlock the screen. There was dried blood in the cracks of the case. I dialed 911 and put it on speaker because I didn’t trust myself to hold it.

The dispatcher’s voice was calm. Too calm.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

—

The cops showed up fast. Faster than I expected. Two cruisers at first, then more. Red and blue lights flooded the trees like some messed-up holiday display.

They separated us immediately.

Hands up. On your knees. Don’t move.

I remember one of them staring at my jacket, at the black blood smeared down my arms, and his hand never left his gun.

They asked us what happened. Over and over. Separately. Same questions, different words.

I told them there were things in the house. I told them they killed everyone. I told them they weren't human.

That was the exact moment their faces changed.

Not fear. Not concern.

Suspicion.

They cuffed my hands. Maya’s too. 

At first, they tried to pin it on me. Or maybe both of us. Kept pressing like we were hiding something, like maybe there was a fight that got out of hand, or we snapped, or it was drugs. Asked where I dumped Nico’s body.

One of the detectives took the revolver out of an evidence bag and set it on the table of the interrogation room like it was a point he’d been waiting to make.

“So you fired this?”

“Yes,” I said. “At the thing.”

“What thing?”

I looked at him. “The thing that killed my family.”

He wrote something down and nodded like that explained everything.

When the forensics team finally showed up and started putting the scene together, it got harder to make it stick. The blood patterns, the way the bodies were torn apart—none of it made sense for a standard attack. Way too violent. Way too messy. Too many injuries that didn’t line up with the weapons they found. No human did that. No animal either, far as they could tell. But they sure as hell weren’t going to write “mythical sky monsters” in the report.

Next theory? My dad.

But he was still locked up. Solid alibi. The detectives even visited him in prison to personally make sure he was still there. 
After that, they looked at Rick. Tasha’s boyfriend. Only problem? They found him too. What was left of him, anyway. His body was found near the front yard, slumped against a tree. Neck snapped like a twig.

That’s when they got quiet. No more hard questions. Just forms. Statements. A counselor.

We were minors. No surviving family. That part was simple.
Child Protect Services got involved.

They wanted to split us up. Said it was temporary, just until they could sort everything out. I got assigned a group home in Clovis. Maya got somewhere in Madera.

—

The day they told me I was getting moved, I didn’t even argue. There wasn’t any fight left. Just this empty numbness that settled behind my ribs and stayed there. The caseworker—Janine or Jenna or something—told me the social worker wanted to talk before the transfer. I figured it was some last-minute paperwork thing.

Instead, they walked me into this windowless office and shut the door behind me.

Maya was already there.

She looked as rough as I felt—pale, shadows under her baby-blue eyes. When she saw me, she blinked like she wasn’t sure I was real. We just stood there for a second.

Then she crossed the room and hugged me so hard it hurt.
I held on. Didn’t say anything. Couldn’t.

“Hey,” she said into my shoulder. Her voice shook once. “Hey,” I replied.

“I thought they sent you away already,” I said.

“Almost,” she said. “Guess we got a delay.”

We pulled apart when someone cleared their throat.

I looked up to see a woman already in the room, standing near the wall.

She was in her late thirties, maybe. She didn’t look like a social worker I’d ever seen. Didn’t smell like stale coffee or exhaustion. Black blazer and jeans. Her dark brown hair was cropped short and neat. Her hazel eyes were sharp, measuring, like she was sizing up threats.

She closed the door behind her.

“I’m glad you two got a moment to catch up,” she said calmly. “Please, sit.”

“My name is Agent Sara Benoit,” she said.

The woman waited until we were seated before she spoke again. She didn’t rush it. Let the silence stretch just long enough to feel intentional.

“I know you’ve already talked to the police,” she said. “Multiple times.”

I let out a short, tired laugh. “Then why are we here again?”
She looked at me directly. Not through me. Not like I was a problem to solve. “Because I’m not with the police.”

Maya stiffened beside me. I felt it through her sleeve.

I said, “So what? You’re a shrink? This is where you tell us we’re crazy, right?”

Benoit shook her head. “No. This is where I tell you I believe you.”

That landed heavier than any I’d heard so far.

I stared at her. “You… what?”

“I believe there was something non-human involved in the killings at that cabin,” she said. Flat. Like she was reading off a weather report. “I believe what you saw in the sky was real. And I believe the entity you described—what the media will eventually call an animal or a cult or a psychotic break—is none of those things.”

The room was quiet except for the hum of the lights.

Maya spoke up. “They said we were traumatized. That our minds filled in the gaps.”

Benoit nodded. “That’s what they have to say. It keeps things neat.”

That pissed me off more than anything else she could’ve said.

“Neat? I saw my family slaughtered,” I said. My voice stayed level, but it took work. “I watched something dressed like evil Santa kidnap my brother . If you’re about to tell me to move on, don’t.”

Benoit didn’t flinch.

“I’m not here to tell you that,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that what took your brother isn’t untouchable. And what killed your family doesn’t get to walk away clean.”

My chest tightened. Maya’s fingers found mine under the table and locked on.

I shook my head. “The fuck can you do about it? What are you? FBI? CIA? Some Men in Black knockoff with worse suits?”

She smirked at my jab, then reached into her blazer slowly, deliberately, like she didn’t want us to think she was pulling a weapon. She flipped open a leather badge wallet and slid it across the table.

‘NORAD
 Special Investigations Division’

The seal was real. The badge was heavy. Government ugly. No flair.

“…NORAD?” I said. “What’s that?”

“North American Aerospace Defense Command,” she explained. “Officially, we track airspace. Missiles. Unidentified aircraft. Anything that crosses borders where it shouldn’t.”

“What the hell does fucking NORAD want with us?” I demanded.

Benoit didn’t flinch. She just stated, “I’m here to offer you a choice.”

“A choice?” Maya asked.

She nodded. “Option one: you go to group homes, therapy, court dates. You try to live with what you saw. The official story will be ‘unknown assailants’ and ‘tragic circumstances.’ Your brother will be listed as deceased once the paperwork catches up.”

My chest burned. “And the other option?”

“Option two,” she said, her voice low and steady, “you come with me. You disappear on paper. New names, new files. You train with us. You learn what these things are, and how to kill them.

I'm 22 weeks pregnant (very healthy pregnancy)

Work full time (8-5) and have a 2.5 year old (and very very consistent but expensive child care thank god)

Obviously the holidays make things more stressful (getting presents, wrapping and ALL the fucking commitments)

But I'm just at my breaking point. Burned out. Feeling unappreciated (for example sent in laws - who just had baby a gift card for coffee for thanksgiving - never got a thank you (did they even get it? Idk)

All day today, my coworkers asked if I can be their out of office while they take 2 (yes 2!) weeks off. I am taking 24th and 25th... I know I could've asked or more and I'm doing it to myself but golly....

I love my husband and he does what he can but the mental load during the holidays is so hard. And most nights he works late (til 9:30 or 10 but thank gos they aren't busy!)

(As I'm baby sitting my nephews while their parents can Christmas shop) oh and have to go to my in laws this weekend... so rarely time to get things done around the house / holiday... wish they could come here instead...

I just want one day. One. Or 3 hours. To do the things I can't do...

Anyway, I'm just burned out, pregnant over worked and feeling on the brink of a menty b!

Thankful grateful but on edge of falling apart.

Starting to resent all my friends who work part time or Stay at Home with their kids. I just want to be able to do the things I don't have time for... just simple things. I want to outsource with a house manager HA",1,1765844138.0,pregnant,2,1.0,False

Hey everyone. I am putting myself out there to meet new people and hopefully build some easy, genuine connections. I am mainly looking for friendship to start. Good conversations, shared interests, someone to laugh with and feel comfortable around. If things naturally grow into something more, I am definitely open to that as well.

A little about me:
I am 33, born and raised in Michigan. I enjoy anything outdoors during the warmer months. Hiking, kayaking, camping, random day trips, bonfires, and pretty much anything that gets me outside. Once winter arrives, I switch into a more relaxed, at home mode. I enjoy reading, watching good shows, drinking coffee, and just enjoying calm nights in with the right person.

Personality wise, I am friendly, laid back, and easy to talk to. Once I am comfortable with someone, I can be silly, sarcastic, and playful. I love to laugh and I enjoy people who do the same. I appreciate genuine and consistent communication without anything forced or awkward. Just two people getting to know each other at their own pace.

What I am hoping to find:
Someone who wants to talk, share stories, joke around, and build something real. Whether it becomes a solid friendship or turns into something deeper, I am open to either. I am not expecting anything instantly. I just want good energy and a natural connection with someone who is also looking for something meaningful.

If any of this sounds like your style, feel free to reach out and tell me a little about yourself. I am always open to a conversation.",2,1765844129.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I visited both cities and absolutely fell head over heels for Boulder's vibe, but my research keeps pointing me toward Denver. Now I'm delightfully torn and would love your insights!
About me & what I'm looking for:
30s, single, Asian female, 5'1"", (mentioning this because walkability and feeling safe walking alone is super important to me), work remotely, non-drinker who enjoys the occasional coffee shop, yoga studios, and hiking trails.
I found a few awesome yoga and hiking groups online, but trying to figure out which neighborhoods would actually be practical in late January/winter weather.
I have a car but would love to minimize driving in Denver if possible because I'm nervous about the traffic stories I've read.
Looking for neighborhoods with great walkability, safety for solo walking (day and evening), and a social scene for 30-somethings that doesn't revolve around bars.
Questions for you lovely people:
Which neighborhoods in Denver or Boulder would you recommend for someone like me? It seems Sloans Lake and near Cheesman Park may be good?
What's the yoga/hiking scene actually like in winter? Any favorite studios or groups?
For those who've lived in both cities - what made you choose one over the other?
Any safety tips I should know about for either city?
Best areas for meeting people in their 30s outside of the bar scene?
Super excited about this adventure and grateful for any advice! 🏔️

1pnnj27,https://www.reddit.com/r/urticaria/comments/1pnnj27/rhapsido_saved_my_life/,Rhapsido Saved My Life,"Hi everyone! I wanted to share my success story with Rhapsido in hopes this can reach people who need it. 

  
I've had CSU for a year and a few months (started after a trip to Hawaii July 2024). I would wake up every day with hives on my arms and thighs with my worst flare ups being all over my body and having to call off of work. I've been getting so anxious since my wedding is May 2026 and I didn't want to be covered in hives, just hoping that that week was a low flare week. I had no success with Prednisone, upping allergy pills, and had a horrible adverse reaction to Dupixent. 

I had a dermatologist appointment on November 4th where she told me about the brand spanking new drug that had literally just got FDA approval. It's formulated specifically for CSU with basically no side effects. Within 24 hours of taking it, I was hive free, and I still am today. 

The one side effect is higher risk of bleeding, which my dermatologist told me to just get off of it for a few days before a surgery (which I don't plan on in the foreseeable future). I will say I did skip a morning dose due to an adverse reaction to an SSRI and I was broken out in hives again. I took my evening dose as scheduled and was hive free come the next morning. 

I'm on my second month and I haven't experienced any other side effects other than literally having my life back. Now is the insurance waiting game, and until it gets approved my derm is being amazing and said she'll keep giving me the samples. 

Please reach out to your dermatologist or allergist about Rhapsido! I literally feel like the drug commercials but it literally gave me my life back. I can use scented lotions, scented body wash, regular detergent, and drink coffee again without worrying about my skin. I used to not be able to wear long sleeves since they would make me itchy, making winter hell, but I don't have to worry about that now. 

Wishing everyone on here the best of luck in their journeys. I know I got out lucky; some of you have been struggling for years without a cure, but I truly hope it's around the corner. ",3,1765844070.0,urticaria,1,1.0,False

The livings I loved about living with my partner were: going to bed and waking up together, making morning coffee together, going grocery shopping and unloading it together, making dinner for us, sharing the chores evenly, good conversations, and the constant companionship.

I did live alone for 5 years before but I am not shy to admit that I got lonely. I found it hard to pack my schedule with enough activities that I did not feel the sting of not having others around. I worked remotely as well.

Yes, I am introspective and like to enjoy my own time, but as an extrovert too, it is hard on me. Now that I’m fresh out of 4+ year relationship, I find it hard to go back to.

Honestly, I am sad and worried about my new future.

Some of them have kids now, some don’t, life just moved on, all normal stuff. But recently I started noticing a pattern that I can’t really unsee anymore. I only get invited to very specific kinds  of plans. Coffee near their place, short walks, early dinners, things like that. Anything that needs more planning, time, or flexibility, I’m suddenly not on the list. At first I thought I was overthinking it, like maybe I was just busy or missed a message or two. But then I realised  I only hear about birthdays, trips, or longer gatherings after the fact, like oh yeah we did that last weekend. When I do get invited, it’s always framed like “this will be quick” or “we might have to leave early cause of the kids”. I don’t mind adjusting sometimes, but it feels  weird knowing I’m now the friend for convenient moments only. 

What really got to me is  that no one ever said this out loud. No fight, no comment, just a quiet reshuffle where I’m included only when I fit easily into the schedule. I don’t even know if they realise they’re doing it. Part of me wants to bring it up, another part feels kinda silly for being hurt by something so subtle.

But then he said she had a bump and even showed him scan letters. I mean if she had a bump and showed him scan letters I’m sure she went through with the pregnancy

So he doesn’t know whether he has a child or not lol. I even asked him what gender and he said he doesn’t know.

So yeah, I now have my endgame setup for less than the cost of a brand new Breville Barista Express. Wild.

I don't care about your ""sir, what would you like? cappuccino, latte, affogato, flat white"" FUCK YOU, Stop making words! I need coffee to keep me awake, not your puzzles and quizzes!

Take your disposable cup and fuck off! What an endearing relation!!

But no, pretentiousness demands sophisticated layers of flattery instead of straight, simple transactions. So, here I am, playing KBC instead of taking my cup and fucking off!

These quizzes and my anxiety have really forced me to prefer black coffee. Does it taste like mud? Sure does. But it comes with absolutely no questions from the barista. Maybe just a thought about what kind of miserable pile of poop drinks muddy water at 11 in the morning. But hey! That's not a question for me to answer, so who cares!

I built it primarily for myself. I love sailing ⛵️ but it scares the 💩 out of me. I always check the sea state before going out. Just so I know what to expect. There’s a rule when the sea is comfortable and when it isn’t. And some variables play a part. This app makes it easy to calculate and uses some humour. 

It hit number 3 in top paid. I’m way too excited. Tomorrow (it’s nearly 01:00 here) I’ll update and optimise the App page. And I have thought of some updates and new features.

I'm 26, from Bangladesh. I came to the United States undocumented in August 2023.

I don't usually talk about this. Not in real life or online. But I have been carrying it for a long time, and I need to get it out.

I crossed the border in Arizona, near Nogales. The heat was bad. I had a small backpack, a few clothes, a phone with a cracked screen, and less than $400. I thought if I fail here, nobody back home will even know what happened to me.

After processing and release, I went to Phoenix, then to El Paso, Texas. Someone I barely knew let me sleep on a couch in a tiny apartment with other people. Poor living conditions do not even cover it. We rotated sleeping on the floor. Some nights, there was almost no food, but I was thankful.

I found work at a small gas station off the highway. Cash under the table. It was long graveyard shifts. Cleaning bathrooms, stocking shelves, working the register. I kept my head down.

One regular customer was a quite white man in his 40s. He dressed like someone who works with his hands. He came in every morning with coffee. Over time we talked, not politics, not immigration, just about life.

Eventually, he asked me how I ended up there. I told him the truth. He did not judge me, he just nodded and said that I work harder than most people he know.

He owned a small agricultural supply business in rural eastern Kansas. Feed, equipment, repairs, etc. He needed real help and offered me a job, with housing included.

I hesitated to be honest. Rural America scared me more than any city. But I was tired of just surviving. So I went.

Kansas was different. It was flat, quiet and very, very conservative. Trump flags everywhere, lots of signs and stares. People didn't say things directly, they just made clear where I stood.

I worked there for months. Long days with physical work. He paid me fairly every time and treated me right. Some of his family liked me, some did not.

Then in July, he told me he had a job in Idaho. It was a bigger operation, with better money, and that he was selling the business, and moving there with his family. But his mother was not coming.

She lived alone on a small farm outside a tiny town. Had lived there her whole life. Her husband had died six years before and she refused to leave the house they built together.

He told me he wanted me to stay with his mom. To live there, help her, drive her to town, do shopping, fix things, keep the farm running, etc. He would pay me a monthly salary, and it was more money than I had ever had.

I knew it sounded crazy. I also knew I had no other choice.

I met her a week later and she was not what I expected. 61 years old, strong posture, sharp eyes, southern drawl, proper, ultra conservative, and incredibly attractive. I mean very good-looking. She didn't smile much and I could tell she didn't trust me.

The town was worse than I imagined. I was the only brown face most days. People stared openly, some said things under their breath and some said them loud.

She was polite but distant. I would say very guarded.

Time changes things. I fixed fences, cooked, listened, did not talk politics, respected her space, and so on. Slowly, she softened, started asking about my life, my family, Bangladesh, my religion, the culture. She explained that she never met someone like me before.

Somewhere along the way I felt that something shifted. I noticed her, not just as ''the boss's mother'' but as a woman. She's very confident, sharp and even funny sometimes. I flirted lightly at first, half joke, half testing. She shut it down. Then pretended she did not hear. Then did not.

Then last week, after living with her for almost five months, it happened. I won't go into details because this is not that kind of post. What I will say is that it was mutual, but complicated since it was something neither of us expected. But I had my eyes on her from day one.

Outside the house, I dealt with racism constantly. Inside, I felt human.

The ICE raids were increasing. I memorized back roads, stayed invisible, and every knock on the door made my heart stop.

I know people will judge me, her and the situation. But life does not follow clean moral lines when you are undocumented, isolated, trying to survive.

1pnmwq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PageTurner627Horror/comments/1pnmwq7/december_took_everything_part_1/,December Took Everything (Part 1),"When dad got locked up again, it didn’t hit right away. He’d been in and out since I was nine, but this time felt different. Longer sentence. Something about assault with a weapon and parole violations. My mom, Marisol, cried once, then shut down completely. No yelling, no last minute plea to judge for leniency—just silence.

“He’s going away for at least fifteen years.”

It wasn’t news. We all knew. I’d heard her crying about it on the phone to my grandma in the Philippines through the paper-thin wall. My little sister, Kiana heard it too but didn’t say anything. Just curled up on the mattress with his headphones on, pretending she couldn’t. 

Then mom couldn’t make rent. The landlord came by with that fake sympathy, like he felt bad but not bad enough to wait one more week for rent before evicting us. 

Our house in Fresno was one of those old stucco duplexes with mold in the vents and a broken front fence. Still, it was home. 

“We’ll get a fresh start,” Mom said.

And by “fresh start,” she meant a cabin in the Sierra Nevada that looked cheap even in blurry online photos. The only reason it was so affordable was because another family—who was somehow even worse off than we were—was willing to split the cost. We’d “make it work.” Whatever that meant.

I packed my clothes in trash bags. My baby brother, Nico, clutched his PS4 the whole time like someone was gonna steal it. Mom sold the washer and our living room couch for gas money.

When we finally pulled up, the place wasn’t a cabin so much as a box with windows. The woods pressed tight around it like the trees wanted to swallow it whole.

“Looks haunted,” I muttered, stepping out of the car and staring at the place. It had a sagging roof, moss creeping up one side, and a screen door that hung off one hinge like it gave up trying years ago.

Nico’s face scrunched up. “Haunted? For real?”

I shrugged. “Guess we’ll find out tonight.”

“We will?” He whispers.

Mom shot me that look. “Seriously, Roen?” she snapped. “You think this is funny? No, baby, it’s not haunted.” She reassured Nico.

I swung one of the trash bags over my shoulder and headed for the front door. The steps creaked loud under my feet, like even they weren’t sure they could hold me. Just as I reached for the knob—
I heard voices. Two people inside, arguing loud enough that I didn’t need to strain to catch it.

“I’m not sharing a room with some random people, Mom!” Said a girl’s voice. 

A second voice fired back, older, calmer but tight with frustration. “Maya, we’ve been over this. We don’t have a choice.”

Then I heard footsteps—fast ones, heavy and pissed off, thudding through the cabin toward the door.

Before I could move out of the way or even say anything, the front door flung open hard—right into me. The edge caught me square in the shoulder and chest, knocking the air out of me as I stumbled backward and landed flat on the porch with a loud thump.

“Shit,” I muttered, wincing.

A shadow filled the doorway. I looked up and there she was—the girl, standing over me with wide eyes and a face full of panic.

“Oh my god—I didn’t see you,” she said, breathless. “Are you okay? I didn’t—God, I’m sorry.”

She knelt down a little, hand halfway out like she wasn’t sure if she should help me up or if she’d already done enough damage.

I sat up, rubbing my ribs and trying not to look like it actually hurt as bad as it did. “Yeah,” I grunted. “I mean, it’s just a screen door. Not like it was made of steel or anything.”

I grabbed her outstretched hand. Her grip was stronger than I expected, but her fingers trembled a little.

She looked about my age—sixteen, maybe seventeen—with this messy blonde braid half falling apart and a hoodie that looked like it had been through a few too many wash cycles. Her nails were painted black, chipped down to the corners. She didn’t let go of my hand right away.

Her face changed fast. Like something hot in her just shut off the second our eyes locked. The sharp edge drained out of her expression, like she forgot what she was mad about.

“I didn’t know anyone was standing out here,” she said again, softer this time. “I just... needed air.”

“It’s all good,” I said, brushing dirt off my jeans and trying to gather my spilled stuff. “Not my first time getting knocked down today.”

She glanced awkwardly back inside. “So... guess that means you’re the people we’re sharing this dump with?”

“Yup. The other half of the broke brigade.”

She held out her hand. “I’m Maya.”

I took it. “Roen.”

“Let me guess…say you’re here because of someone else’s screw-up.”

“How’s you know?” I asked surprised.

She shrugged. “Let’s just say you’re not the only one.” 

Behind me, Nico whispered, “Is she a ghost?”

Maya raised an eyebrow. “Who's that?”

“My brother. He’s eight. He’s gonna ask a million questions, so get ready.”

She smirked. “Bring it on. I’ve survived worse.”
I believed her.

Kiana was already climbing out of the car, dragging her own trash bag behind her, when she caught sight of me and Maya still talking.

“Ohhh,” she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, drawing out the sound with a stupid grin. “Roen’s already got a girlfriend in the woods.”

I rolled my eyes. “Shut up, Kiana.”

Maya snorted but didn’t say anything, just crossed her arms and waited like she was curious how this was gonna play out.

“I’m just saying,” she whispered, “you’ve known her for like two minutes and you’re already helping each other off the porch like it’s a rom-com.”

“You’re not even supposed to know what that is.”
“I’m twelve, not dumb.”

“She’s cute,” Kiana added, smirking now as she walked past. “Y’all gonna braid each other’s hair later?”

“I swear to god—”

“Language,” Mom chided from behind me. 

Before I could fire back, the front door creaked open again, and a woman stepped out. Thin, wiry frame. She wore a faded flannel and sweatpants like she’d stopped trying to impress anyone years ago. Her eyes darted across us—counting, maybe—and her smile didn’t quite reach all the way up.

“You must be the Mayumis,” she said. Her voice was raspy, probably from too many cigarettes or too many bad nights. Maybe both. “I’m Tasha. Tasha Foster.”

She stepped closer, and the smell hit me—sharp and bitter. Whiskey. 

Mom appeared behind us just in time. “Hi, I’m Marisol,” she said quietly, arms crossed like she already regretted every decision that led us here.

They hugged briefly. More of a press of shoulders than a real embrace. Tasha nodded toward the cabin. “We’re tight on space, but we cleared out the back room. Me, you, and the girls can take that. The boys can have the den.”

“Boys?” I asked, stepping into the doorway and immediately getting swarmed by noise.

Inside, it looked like someone tried to clean but gave up halfway through. There were dishes drying on one side of the sink, and unfolded laundry piled on the couch. A crusty pizza box sat on the counter next to an open bottle of something that definitely wasn’t juice.

Then came the thundering feet—three of them. First was a chubby kid with wild curls and a superhero shirt that was two sizes too small. He stopped, blinked at us, then just yelled, “New people!”

A girl around Kiana’s age followed, hair in tight braids and a glare that said she didn’t trust any of us. Behind her was a tall, lanky boy with headphones around his neck and that look teens get when they’re stuck somewhere they hate.

Maya rolled her eyes. “These are my siblings. That loud one’s Jay, the girl with the death stare is Bri, and the quiet one’s Malik.”

Jay darted toward Nico immediately, pointing at the PS4. “You got games?!”

Nico lit up. “A bunch.”

Mom and Tasha slipped into the kitchen to talk in low voices while the rest of us stood there in this weird moment of strangers under one roof. 

Maya looked around at the chaos. “So… welcome to the party.”

“Some party,” I muttered, but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth.

Kiana elbowed me. “I like it here,” she said.

—

Starting a new school in the middle of the year is trash. No one tells you where anything is, teachers already have favorites, and everybody’s locked into their little cliques like they’re afraid being friendly’s contagious.

Maya and I ended up in the same homeroom, which helped. It was the only part of the day that didn’t feel like I was walking into someone else’s house uninvited. She sat two rows over at first, headphones in, scribbling in the margins of a beat-up copy of The Bell Jar. I didn’t even know she read stuff like that.

We got paired up in Physics too—lab partners. I’m more of the “just tell me what to do and I’ll do it” type when it comes to school. I play ball. Football mostly, but I’m decent at track. Maya actually liked the subject. Asked questions. Took notes like they meant something. The first week, I thought we’d hate working together—like she’d think I was an idiot or something—but it wasn’t like that. She explained things without making it weird. 

She’d let me copy her answers—but only after I tried to understand them first.

At lunch, she sat outside under the trees near the side parking lot. Alone at first. I started joining her, ditching my usual spot with the guys.

I soon found out why she kept to herself. It started small. A few whispers behind cupped hands, little laughs when Maya walked past in the hallway. She didn’t react at first, just rolled her eyes and kept walking. But I saw the tightness in her jaw. The way her grip on her backpack straps got a little firmer.

Then one day, someone didn’t bother whispering.

The comments started behind her back—“Isn’t she the one with the crackhead mom?”, “Heard she’s got, like, four half-siblings. All different dads.” 

I felt Maya tense beside me. Not flinch—just go still, like something inside her snapped into place. She didn’t say anything. Didn’t even look at them. She just turned and walked fast, then faster, then she was running down the hall.

“Yo,” I called after her, but she was already gone.
I spun back to the group gossiping. 

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I snapped. Heads turned. Good. 

One of the guys laughed. “Relax, man. It’s just facts.”

“Facts?” I stepped closer. “You don’t know shit about her.”

The girl rolled her eyes. “She’s gonna end up just like her mom anyway. Everyone knows that.”

“Oh fuck off!” I shouted. I didn’t wait. I took off after Maya.

I checked the bathroom first. Empty. Then the quad. Nothing. My last period bell rang, but I didn’t care. I headed to the library because it was the only quiet place left in this school.

She was tucked into the far back corner, half-hidden behind the tall shelves nobody ever went to. Sitting on the floor. Knees pulled in. Hoodie sleeve pushed up.

My stomach dropped.

“Maya,” I said, low. Careful.

She didn’t look up.

I took a few slow steps closer and saw it—the razor in her hand. 

Her arm was a roadmap of old lines. Some faded. Some not.

“Hey,” I said, softer now. “Don’t.”

Her hand paused.

“You’re not allowed to say that,” she muttered. Her voice was wrecked. “You don’t get to stop me.”

“I know,” I said. “But I’m asking anyway.”

She laughed once, sharp and ugly. “They’re right, you know. About me. About all of it.”

I crouched down in front of her, keeping my hands where she could see them. “They don’t know you.”

“They know enough,” she said. “My mom’s an addict. She disappears for days. Sometimes weeks. We all got different dads. None of them stuck. People hear that and they already got my ending figured out.”

“You’re not,” I said.

She lifted the razor slightly. “You don’t know that.”

She finally looked at me. Her blue eyes were red, furious, tired. “You think I don’t see it? I’m already halfway there.”

I swallowed. “I know what it’s like when everyone assumes you’re trash because of who raised you.”
That got her attention.

“My dad’s been locked up most of my life,” I said. “I’ve got scars too.” I tapped my knuckles. Old marks. “From standing up to him when I shouldn’t have. From thinking I could fix things if I just tried harder.”
She stared at my hands like she was seeing them for the first time.

“I used to think if I didn’t fight back, I’d turn into him,” I went on. “Turns out, fighting him didn’t make me better either. Just made everything louder.”

Her grip on the razor loosened a little.

I reached out slowly. “Can you give me that?”

She hesitated. Long enough that my heart was pounding in my ears. Then she dropped the razor into my palm like it weighed a thousand pounds.

She covered her face and finally broke.

I stayed there. Didn’t try to fix it. Didn’t say the wrong hopeful crap. Just sat on the library floor with her while she cried it out.

—
​​That night, I knocked on Maya’s door after everyone had crashed.

“I have an idea,” I whispered. “It’s mean though…”
Maya smirked. “The meaner the better.”

That morning, we showed up to school early. We had backpacks full of supplies—a screwdriver, glitter, expired sardines, and four tiny tubes of industrial-strength superglue.

We snuck into the locker hallway when the janitor went for his smoke break. Maya kept lookout while I unscrewed the hinges on three locker doors—each one belonging to the worst of the trash-talkers. We laced the inside edges with glue, so when they slammed shut like usual, they’d stay that way. 

Inside one of them, we left a glitter bomb rigged to pop the second the door opened. In another, Maya stuffed the expired sardines into a pencil pouch and superglued that shut too. The smell would hit like a punch in the face.

We barely made it to homeroom before the chaos started.

First period: screaming from the hallway. Second period: a janitor with bolt cutters. By third period, the whole school was buzzing.

And then we got called to the office.

We got caught on cameras. Of course. We didn’t even try to lie. Just sat there while the vice principal read us the suspension notice like he was personally offended.

“Three days. Home. No extracurriculars. You’re lucky we’re not calling the police.”

Outside the office, Maya bumped my shoulder. “Worth it?”

I grinned. “Every second.”

—

I got my permit that November. Mom let me borrow the car sometimes, mostly because she was too tired to argue. We made it count—gas station dinners, thrift store photo shoots, late-night drives to nowhere.

We’d sneak out some nights just to lie in the truck bed and stare at the stars through the trees, counting satellites and pretending they were escape pods.

The first time she kissed me, it wasn’t planned. We were sitting in the school parking lot, waiting for the rain to let up. She just looked over and said, “I’m gonna do something stupid,” then leaned in before I could ask what. After that, it all moved fast.

The first time we had sex was in the back of the car, parked on an old forestry road, all fumbling hands and held breath. We thought we were careful.

The scare happened two weeks later. A late period, a pregnancy test from the pharmacy. The longest three minutes of our lives, standing in that cabin’s moldy bathroom, waiting. When it was negative, we didn’t celebrate. She laughed. I almost cried.

After that, we thought more about the future. Maya started talking about college more. Somewhere far. I didn’t have plans like that, but I was working weekends at the pizza shop, and started saving. Not for clothes or games—just for getting out. 

—

By December, things settled down a bit. We tried to make the best of the holidays. All month, the cabin smelled like pine and mildew and cheap cinnamon candles. We’d managed to scrape together some decorations—paper snowflakes, a string of busted lights that only half worked, and a sad fake tree we found at the thrift store for five bucks. Nico hung plastic ornaments like it was the real deal. Kiana made hot cocoa from a dollar store mix and forced everyone to drink it. Mom even smiled a few times, though it never lasted.

Maya and I did our part. Helped the little kids wrap presents in newspaper. Made jokes about how Santa probably skipped our cabin because the GPS gave up halfway up the mountain. 

Even Tasha seemed mellow for once.

But then Christmas Eve hit. 

Maya’s mom announced that afternoon she was inviting her new boyfriend over for dinner. Some dude named Rick or Rich or something. Maya went quiet first, then full-on exploded.

“You’re kidding, right?” she snapped. “You’re really bringing some random guy here? On Christmas Eve?”

Tasha shrugged like it was no big deal. “He’s not random. I’ve known him for months.”

“And that makes it fucking okay? And now we’re supposed to play happy family?”

“Watch your mouth.”

“Or what? You’ll vanish for a week and pretend this never happened?”

Tasha lit a cigarette inside the house, which she only did when she was mad. “It’s my house, Maya. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”

Maya laughed. “Gladly.”

She grabbed her bag and was out the door before I could say anything. I followed.

We sat on the steps while the cold settled into our bones. She didn’t talk. Just stared out at the trees, fists clenched in her lap like she was holding herself together by force. I leaned over, bumped her shoulder.

“Let’s bounce.”

She looked at me. “Where?""

“Anywhere but here.”

So we sneaked out. I borrowed Mom’s car.

We drove up to a dirt road, way up past the ranger station, where the trees cleared and gave you this wide, unreal view of the valley below. You could see for miles.

I popped the trunk, and we sat with our legs hanging out the back, wrapped in a blanket. I pulled out the six-pack I’d stashed—some knockoff lager from that corner store near school that never asked questions. Maya lit a joint she’d swiped from her mom’s stash and passed it to me without saying anything.

We just sat there, knees touching, sipping beer and smoking the joint, watching our breath cloud up in the freezing air. Maya played music off her phone, low. Some old indie Christmas playlist she’d downloaded for the irony.

At one point, she leaned her head on my shoulder.

“Thanks,” she whispered.

“For what?”

“For giving me something that doesn’t suck.”

—

Maya was humming some half-forgotten carol when I noticed it—this streak of light cutting across the night sky, low and fast. At first I thought it was just a shooting star, but it didn’t fizzle out like it was supposed to. It curved. Like it was changing direction. Like it knew where it was going.

“Did you see that?” I asked.

She lifted her head. “What?”

I pointed. “That...”

Maya squinted. “What am I supposed to be looking at?”
I fumbled the binoculars from the glovebox—old ones my uncle gave me for spotting deer. I raised them to my eyes.

I held them up so that Maya could see too, adjusted the focus, and froze.

Maya noticed right away. “What? What is it?”

Through the binoculars, there were figures—too many to count, all of them fast. Not like planes. More like shadows ripping across the sky, riding... something. Horses, maybe. Or things shaped like horses but wrong. Twisted. And riders—tall, thin figures wrapped in cloaks that whipped in the wind, some with skull faces, some with no faces at all. Weapons glinted in their hands. Swords. Spears. Chains.

“Oh. No,” Maya whispered. 

“What is it?” I asked.

She looked at me. “It’s heading towards the cabin.”

I snatched the binoculars back, my hands shaking so hard the image blurred. It took me three tries to steady them against my face.

She was right.

The things weren’t just in the sky anymore. They were descending, a dark wave pouring down the tree line toward the base of the mountain. Toward our road. Toward the cabin.

“We have to go. Now.” 

We scrambled into the car. I spun the tires in the dirt, wrenching the wheel toward home. The headlights carved a shaky path through the dark as we flew down the mountain road, branches slapping the windshield.
“Call my mom,” I told Maya, handing my phone to her. 
“Put it on speaker.”
The ringing seemed to last forever. Mom picked up.

“Roen? Where are you? Where’s the car?” The anger was a live wire.

“Mom, listen! You have to get everyone inside. Lock the doors. Right now.”

“What are you talking about? Are you in trouble?”

“Mom, no! Listen! There’s something coming. From the sky. We saw it. It’s coming down the mountain toward the cabin.”

A beat of dead silence. Then her tone, cold and disbelieving. “Have you been doing drugs? Is Maya with you?”

“Mom, I swear to God, I’m… Please, just look outside. Go to a window and look up toward the ridge.”

“I’m looking, Roen. I don’t see anything but trees and…” She trailed off. I heard a faint, distant sound through the phone, like bells, but twisted and metallic. “What is that noise?”

Then, Nico’s voice, excited in the background. “Mom! Mom! Look! It’s Santa’s sleigh! I see the lights!”

Kiana joined in. “Whoa! Are those reindeer?”

“Kids, get back from the window,” Mom said, but her voice had changed. The anger was gone, replaced by a slow-dawning confusion. The bells were louder now, mixed with a sound like wind tearing through a canyon.

“Mom, it’s NOT Santa!” I was yelling, my foot pressing the accelerator to the floor. The car fishtailed on a gravel curve. “Get everyone and run into the woods! Now!”

The line went quiet for one second too long. Not dead quiet—I could hear the muffled rustle of the phone in my mom’s hand, a sharp intake of breath.

Then the sounds started.

Not bells anymore. Something lower, a grinding hum that vibrated through the phone speaker. It was followed by a skittering, scraping noise, like claws on slate, getting closer. Fast.

“Marisol?” Tasha’s voice, distant and confused. “Is something on the roof?”

A thud shook the line, so heavy it made my mom gasp. Then a shriek—not human, something high and chittering.

A window shattered. A massive, bursting crunch, like something had come straight through the wall.

Then the screams started.

Not just screams of fear. These were sounds of pure, physical terror. Kiana’s high-pitched shriek cut off into a gurgle. Nico wailed, “Mommy!” before his voice was swallowed by a thick, wet thud and a crash of furniture.

“NO! GET AWAY FROM THEM!” My mom’s voice was raw, a warrior’s cry. I heard a grunt of effort, the smash of something heavy—maybe a lamp, a chair—connecting, followed by a hiss that was absolutely not human.

Tasha was cursing, a stream of furious, slurred shouts. There was a scuffle, then a body hitting the floor.

“ROEN!” My mom screamed my name into the phone. It was the last clear word.

A final, piercing shriek was cut short. Then a heavy, dragging sound. 

The line hissed with empty static for three heartbeats.

Then it went dead.

The car tore around the last bend. The cabin came into view, every window blazing with light. The front door was gone. Just a dark, open hole.

I slammed on the brakes, the car skidding to a stop fifty yards away.

The car was still ticking when I killed the engine. 
Maya grabbed my arm. “Roen. Don’t.”

I pulled free. My legs felt numb, like they didn’t belong to me anymore, but they still moved. Every step toward the house felt wrong, like I was walking into a memory that hadn’t happened yet.

The ground between us and the cabin was torn up—deep gouges in the dirt, snapped branches, something dragged straight through the yard. The porch was half gone. The roof sagged in the middle like it had been stepped on.

We desperately called our family’s names. But some part of me already knew no one would answer.
The inside smelled wrong. Something metallic and burnt.

The living room barely looked like a room anymore. Furniture smashed flat. Walls cracked. Blood everywhere—smeared, sprayed, soaked into the carpet so dark it almost looked black. Bodies were scattered where people had been standing or running.

Jay was closest to the door. Or what was left of him. His body lay twisted at an angle that didn’t make sense, like he’d been thrown. 

Bri was near the hallway. She was facedown, drowned in her own blood. One arm stretched out like she’d been reaching for someone. Malik was farther back, slumped against the wall, eyes open but empty, throat cut clean. 

Tasha was near the kitchen. Or what was left of her. Her torso was slashed open, ribs visible through torn fabric. Her head was missing. One hand was clenched around a broken bottle, like she’d tried to fight back even when it was already over.

Maya dropped to her knees.

“No, mommy, no…” she said. Over and over. 

I kept moving because if I stopped, I wasn’t sure I’d start again.

My hands were shaking so bad I had to press them into my jeans to steady myself.

“Mom,” I called out, even though I already knew.

The back room was crushed inward like something heavy had landed there.

Mom was on the floor. I knew it was her because she was curled around a smaller body.

Kiana was inside her arms, turned into my mom’s chest. Her head was gone. Just a ragged stump at her neck, soaked dark. My mom’s face was frozen mid-scream, eyes wide, mouth open, teeth bared.

I couldn’t breathe. My chest locked up, and for a second I thought I might pass out standing there.
I dropped to my knees anyway.

“I’m sorry,” I said. To both of them. To all of them. Like it might still matter.

Then, something moved.

Not the house settling. Not the wind. This was close. Wet. Fast.

I snapped my head toward the hallway and backed up on instinct, almost slipping in blood. My heart was hammering so hard it felt like it was shaking my teeth loose.

“Maya,” I said, low and sharp. “Get up. Something’s still here.”

She sucked in a breath like she’d been punched and scrambled to her feet, eyes wild. I looked around for anything that wasn’t broken or nailed down.

That’s when I saw my mom’s hand.

Tucked against her wrist, half-hidden by her sleeve, was a revolver. The snub‑nose she kept buried in the back of the closet “just in case.” I’d seen it once, years ago, when she thought my dad was coming back drunk and angry.

I knelt and pried it free, gently, like she might still feel it.

The gun was warm.

I flipped the cylinder open with shaking fingers. Five loaded chambers. One spent casing.

“She got a shot off,” I whispered. 

Maya was already moving. She grabbed a bat leaning against the wall near the tree—aluminum, cheap, still wrapped with a torn bow. Jay’s Christmas present. She peeled the plastic off and took a stance like she’d done this before.

The thing scuttled out of the hallway on all fours, moving with a broken, jerky grace. It was all wrong—a patchwork of fur and leathery skin, twisted horns, and eyes that burned like wet matches. It was big, shoulders hunched low to clear the ceiling. And on its flank, a raw, blackened crater wept thick, tar-like blood. My mom’s shot.

Our eyes met. Its jaws unhinged with a sound like cracking ice.

It charged.

I didn’t think. I raised the revolver and pulled the trigger. The first blast was deafening in the shattered room. It hit the thing in the chest, barely slowing it. I fired again. And again. The shots were too fast, my aim wild. I saw chunks of it jerk away. One shot took a piece of its ear. Another sparked off a horn.
It was on me.

The smell hit—old blood and wet earth. A claw swiped, ripping my jacket.

That’s when the bat connected.

Maya swung from the side with everything she had. The aluminum thwanged against its knee. Something cracked. The creature buckled. She swung again, a two-handed blow to its ribs. Another sickening crunch.

The creature turned on her, giving me its side. I jammed the barrel of the pistol into its ribcase and fired the last round point-blank. The thing let out a shriek of pure agony.

The creature reeled back, a spray of dark fluid gushing from the new hole in its side. It hissed, legs buckling beneath it. It took a step forward and collapsed hard, one hand clawing at the floor like it still wanted to fight. 

I stood there with the revolver hanging useless in my hand, ears ringing, lungs barely working. My jacket, my hands, my face—everything was slick with its blood. Thick, black, warm. It dripped off my fingers and splattered onto the wrecked floor like oil.

I couldn’t move. My brain felt unplugged. Like if I stayed perfectly still, none of this would be real.

“Roen.” Maya’s voice sounded far away. Then closer. “Roen—look at me.”

I didn’t.

She grabbed my wrists hard. Her hands were shaking worse than mine. “Hey. Hey. We have to go. Right now.”

I blinked. My eyes burned. “My mom… Kiana…”

“I know, babe,” she said, voice cracking but steady anyway. “But we can’t stay here.”

Something deep in me fought that. Screamed at me to stay. To do something. To not leave them like this. 

Maya tugged me toward the door. I let her.

We stumbled out into the cold night, slipping in the torn-up dirt. The air hit my face and I sucked it in like I’d been underwater too long. The sky above the cabin was alive.

Shapes moved across it—dark figures lifting off from the ground, rising in spirals and lines, mounting beasts that shouldn’t exist. Antlers. Wings. Too many legs. Too many eyes. The sound came back, clearer now: bells, laughter, howling wind.

They rose over the treeline in a long, crooked procession, silhouettes cutting across the moon. And at the front of it—
I stopped dead.

The sleigh floated higher than the rest, massive and ornate, pulled by creatures that looked like reindeer only in the loosest sense. Their bodies were stretched wrong, ribs showing through skin, eyes glowing like coals.

At the reins stood him.

Tall. Broad. Wrapped in red that looked stained in blood. His beard hung in clumps, matted and dark. His smile was too wide, teeth too many. A crown of antlers rose from his head, tangled with bells that rang wrong—deep, warped.

He reached down into the sleigh, grabbed something that kicked and screamed, and hauled it up by the arm.

Nico.

My brother thrashed, crying, his small hands clawing at the edge of the sleigh. I saw his face clearly in the firelight—terror, confusion, mouth open as he screamed my name.

“NO!” I tried to run. Maya wrapped her arms around my chest and hauled me back with everything she had.

The figure laughed. A deep, booming sound that echoed through the trees and into my bones. He shoved Nico headfirst into a bulging sack already writhing with movement—other kids, other screams—then tied it shut like it was nothing.

The sleigh lurched forward.The procession surged after it, riders whooping and shrieking as they climbed into the sky. 

Something dragged itself out of the cabin behind us.

The wounded creature. The one we thought was dead.

It staggered on three limbs, leaving a thick trail of blood across the porch and into the dirt. It let out a broken, furious cry and launched itself forward as the sleigh passed overhead.

Its claws caught the back rail of the sleigh. It slammed into the side hard, dangling there, legs kicking uselessly as the procession carried it upward. Blood sprayed out behind it in a long, dark arc, raining down through the trees.

For a few seconds, it hung on. Dragged. Refused to let go.
Then its grip failed.

The creature fell.

It vanished into the forest below with a distant, wet crash that echoed once and then went silent.

The sleigh didn’t slow.

The Santa thing threw his head back and laughed again, louder this time, like the sound itself was a victory. Then the hunt disappeared into the clouds, the bells fading until there was nothing left but wind and ruined trees and the broken shell of the cabin behind us.

—

We just sat down in the dirt a few yards from the cabin and held onto each other like if we let go, one of us would disappear too.

I don’t know how long it was. Long enough for the cold to stop mattering. Long enough for my hands to go numb around Maya’s jacket. Long enough for my brain to start doing this stupid thing where it kept trying to rewind, like maybe I’d missed a moment where I could’ve done something different.

It was Maya who finally remembered the phone.

“Roen,” she said, voice hoarse. “We have to call the police….”

My hands shook so bad I dropped my phone twice before I managed to unlock the screen. There was dried blood in the cracks of the case. I dialed 911 and put it on speaker because I didn’t trust myself to hold it.

The dispatcher’s voice was calm. Too calm.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

—

The cops showed up fast. Faster than I expected. Two cruisers at first, then more. Red and blue lights flooded the trees like some messed-up holiday display.

They separated us immediately.

Hands up. On your knees. Don’t move.

I remember one of them staring at my jacket, at the black blood smeared down my arms, and his hand never left his gun.

They asked us what happened. Over and over. Separately. Same questions, different words.

I told them there were things in the house. I told them they killed everyone. I told them they weren't human.

That was the exact moment their faces changed.

Not fear. Not concern.

Suspicion.

They cuffed my hands. Maya’s too. 

At first, they tried to pin it on me. Or maybe both of us. Kept pressing like we were hiding something, like maybe there was a fight that got out of hand, or we snapped, or it was drugs. Asked where I dumped Nico’s body.

One of the detectives took the revolver out of an evidence bag and set it on the table of the interrogation room like it was a point he’d been waiting to make.

“So you fired this?”

“Yes,” I said. “At the thing.”

“What thing?”

I looked at him. “The thing that killed my family.”

He wrote something down and nodded like that explained everything.

When the forensics team finally showed up and started putting the scene together, it got harder to make it stick. The blood patterns, the way the bodies were torn apart—none of it made sense for a standard attack. Way too violent. Way too messy. Too many injuries that didn’t line up with the weapons they found. No human did that. No animal either, far as they could tell. But they sure as hell weren’t going to write “mythical sky monsters” in the report.

Next theory? My dad.

But he was still locked up. Solid alibi. The detectives even visited him in prison to personally make sure he was still there. 
After that, they looked at Rick. Tasha’s boyfriend. Only problem? They found him too. What was left of him, anyway. His body was found near the front yard, slumped against a tree. Neck snapped like a twig.

That’s when they got quiet. No more hard questions. Just forms. Statements. A counselor.

We were minors. No surviving family. That part was simple.
Child Protect Services got involved.

They wanted to split us up. Said it was temporary, just until they could sort everything out. I got assigned a group home in Clovis. Maya got somewhere in Madera.

—

The day they told me I was getting moved, I didn’t even argue. There wasn’t any fight left. Just this empty numbness that settled behind my ribs and stayed there. The caseworker—Janine or Jenna or something—told me the social worker wanted to talk before the transfer. I figured it was some last-minute paperwork thing.

Instead, they walked me into this windowless office and shut the door behind me.

Maya was already there.

She looked as rough as I felt—pale, shadows under her baby-blue eyes. When she saw me, she blinked like she wasn’t sure I was real. We just stood there for a second.

Then she crossed the room and hugged me so hard it hurt.
I held on. Didn’t say anything. Couldn’t.

“Hey,” she said into my shoulder. Her voice shook once. “Hey,” I replied.

“I thought they sent you away already,” I said.

“Almost,” she said. “Guess we got a delay.”

We pulled apart when someone cleared their throat.

I looked up to see a woman already in the room, standing near the wall.

She was in her late thirties, maybe. She didn’t look like a social worker I’d ever seen. Didn’t smell like stale coffee or exhaustion. Black blazer and jeans. Her dark brown hair was cropped short and neat. Her hazel eyes were sharp, measuring, like she was sizing up threats.

She closed the door behind her.

“I’m glad you two got a moment to catch up,” she said calmly. “Please, sit.”

“My name is Agent Sara Benoit,” she said.

The woman waited until we were seated before she spoke again. She didn’t rush it. Let the silence stretch just long enough to feel intentional.

“I know you’ve already talked to the police,” she said. “Multiple times.”

I let out a short, tired laugh. “Then why are we here again?”
She looked at me directly. Not through me. Not like I was a problem to solve. “Because I’m not with the police.”

Maya stiffened beside me. I felt it through her sleeve.

I said, “So what? You’re a shrink? This is where you tell us we’re crazy, right?”

Benoit shook her head. “No. This is where I tell you I believe you.”

That landed heavier than any I’d heard so far.

I stared at her. “You… what?”

“I believe there was something non-human involved in the killings at that cabin,” she said. Flat. Like she was reading off a weather report. “I believe what you saw in the sky was real. And I believe the entity you described—what the media will eventually call an animal or a cult or a psychotic break—is none of those things.”

The room was quiet except for the hum of the lights.

Maya spoke up. “They said we were traumatized. That our minds filled in the gaps.”

Benoit nodded. “That’s what they have to say. It keeps things neat.”

That pissed me off more than anything else she could’ve said.

“Neat? I saw my family slaughtered,” I said. My voice stayed level, but it took work. “I watched something dressed like evil Santa kidnap my brother . If you’re about to tell me to move on, don’t.”

Benoit didn’t flinch.

“I’m not here to tell you that,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that what took your brother isn’t untouchable. And what killed your family doesn’t get to walk away clean.”

My chest tightened. Maya’s fingers found mine under the table and locked on.

I shook my head. “The fuck can you do about it? What are you? FBI? CIA? Some Men in Black knockoff with worse suits?”

She smirked at my jab, then reached into her blazer slowly, deliberately, like she didn’t want us to think she was pulling a weapon. She flipped open a leather badge wallet and slid it across the table.

‘NORAD
 Special Investigations Division’

The seal was real. The badge was heavy. Government ugly. No flair.

“…NORAD?” I said. “What’s that?”

“North American Aerospace Defense Command,” she explained. “Officially, we track airspace. Missiles. Unidentified aircraft. Anything that crosses borders where it shouldn’t.”

“What the hell does fucking NORAD want with us?” I demanded.

Benoit didn’t flinch. She just stated, “I’m here to offer you a choice.”

“A choice?” Maya asked.

She nodded. “Option one: you go to group homes, therapy, court dates. You try to live with what you saw. The official story will be ‘unknown assailants’ and ‘tragic circumstances.’ Your brother will be listed as deceased once the paperwork catches up.”

My chest burned. “And the other option?”

“Option two,” she said, her voice low and steady, “you come with me. You disappear on paper. New names, new files. You train with us. You learn what these things are, and how to kill them. Then you find the ones who did this. You get your brother back, and you make them pay.”

Written by Stephanie BoothMedically Reviewed by Poonam Sachdev on June 04, 2024","# he Struggle of Insomnia

About 20% of people wake up in the middle of the night, then struggle to get back to sleep. This type of [insomnia](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/insomnia-symptoms-and-causes) can be stressful, not to mention exhausting. Keep reading for tips to help you quickly doze off -- and steps you can take to keep these mid-sleep awakenings from happening in the first place.

# Forget About the Time

As you toss and turn in the middle of the night, it’s tempting to peek at your clock. But each time you do, you’ll worry how much sleep you’ve lost and only add to your stress. That can make it even harder for you to relax and get back to sleep. Turn your clock toward the wall, put your watch in a drawer, and resist the urge to check the time on your phone.

# Stay Away From Screens

The [blue light](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/what-is-blue-light) from any screen, whether a tablet, phone, or laptop, signals to your brain that it’s time to wake up. Keep devices out of reach when you wake up in the middle of the night. And while you’re at it, turn off all your screens an hour before bedtime, too.

# Move to Another Room

If you’ve been awake for 20 minutes or longer, you may want to get up and out of bed. Without turning on any bright lights, move to a different room. Don’t turn on the TV. Instead, do something peaceful and calming. You could take a few deep breaths or read a book. (Just don’t choose a real page-turner!) If you wait until you feel [sleepy](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adderall-sleepiness) to go back to bed, you may find it easier to drift off.

# Don’t Be Productive

You may be tempted to make the most of your extra time awake, but don't. The middle of the night isn’t the right time to tackle chores, get ahead at work, or be creative in the kitchen. If you do and get something out of it, you reward your brain for waking up when it shouldn't. That makes it more likely to happen again.

# Get Counting -- Backwards

Is a “busy brain” the reason you’re up at night? If so, you’ll need to turn it off before you can get back to sleep. One easy way to do that: Count backwards from 100. It shifts your focus away from past regrets and future worries and forces your brain to stay in the present. Once that happens, you may feel relaxed enough to close your eyes and return to sleep.

# Ease Your Muscles

Your muscles need to be at ease for you to fall asleep. If you’re tense, you might not even realize that they are, too. A technique called “progressive [relaxation](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/relaxation-techniques)” can help. Start at your feet and flex all the muscles in your [toes](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/numbness-toes) for 5 seconds, then relax. Take a slow, [deep breath](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/how-to-deep-breathe). Repeat these steps with your legs, backside, belly, chest, arms, and face. You’ll feel the difference.

# Unwind at Bedtime

Find ways to ease your stress before you go to bed. You might want to listen to soothing music or a calming podcast. You could also do a few easy yoga poses or just sit quietly and take a few deep breaths. When you fall asleep with a quiet mind, you’re more likely to stay asleep.

# Cut Back on Caffeine

Whether it’s in coffee, tea, soda, energy drinks, or chocolate, [caffeine](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-979/caffeine) triggers your brain to stay awake. And although these effects begin quickly (within an hour), they also linger in your body longer than you may realize. Half of the caffeine in your drinks is still in your system 3 to 5 hours after you drink it. To make sure your sleep doesn’t pay a price, avoid all caffeine after 1 p.m.

# Aim for a Noise-Free Bedroom

While you sleep, your brain is still listening. The sounds that it hears can wake you up, even from [deep sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-101). This is more likely the later it gets, or if the noise signals danger, like a [crying](https://www.webmd.com/balance/why-we-cry-tearing-up) baby or a police siren. Make your bedroom as quiet as you can. Earplugs might help. A fan or white noise machine can also block sounds that can jolt you awake.

# Keep Cool

Is your bedroom too warm? Cool temperatures help your body sleep. So try to keep your sleeping space between 60 and 67 degrees. It can be a challenge to stay cool if you’re going through [menopause](https://www.webmd.com/menopause/menopause-basics) and are prone to [hot flashes](https://www.webmd.com/menopause/menopause-hot-flashes) and night sweats. If you are, you may also want to turn on a fan. You might also want to cover up with several light blankets instead of one heavy comforter.

# Go Easy on the Alcohol

You may think a beer or glass of wine before bed helps you fall asleep. Alcohol does boost a chemical in your body that helps you sleep. But you quickly run out of this chemical. That can leave you wide awake before morning. (A drink before bed can also get you up to use the bathroom.) Cut back on the adult beverages and you’ll likely sleep more soundly.

# Meditate

Learn this popular practice and you’ll be able to quiet those racing, middle-of-the-night thoughts. It’s simpler than it sounds. Sit quietly and focus on your breathing. Think of a calming word or short phrase. You can also picture a place that makes you happy. If your thoughts wander off, don’t judge yourself. Simply return to your breathing and the focus you’ve chosen. The more you practice it, the easier it'll get.

# Stick to a Schedule

If you were up for a while during the night, you’ll likely be [tired](https://www.webmd.com/women/why-so-tired-10-causes-fatigue) and groggy the next morning. If you can, try not to sleep in or take a nap to make up for it. It’s crucial to stick close to the same bedtime and wake-up time every day. It trains your body to know awake time vs. sleep time. Once it does, you might find yourself waking up less often.

# Talk to Your Doctor

Some people wake up in the middle of the night because of a health issue. If you try these tips and still find yourself awake when you should be asleep, let your doctor know. Chronic pain, [mental health](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-types-illness) conditions like [depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/what-is-depression), and sleep issues like [sleep apnea](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/sleep-apnea) may be to blame.

Why Addiction Isn’t About Pleasure — It’s About Losing the Map

There’s a popular misunderstanding that dopamine is pleasure.

It isn’t.

Dopamine is direction. It’s the brain’s way of saying that matters, go there, do that again. Pleasure comes later — if at all. Dopamine doesn’t reward happiness; it rewards pursuit.

When people talk about “chasing the high,” what they’re really chasing is orientation in a world where their internal compass has started to fail.

This matters — because in a society saturated with fentanyl, meth, alcohol, algorithms, and endless novelty, we’ve confused height with meaning.

⸻

Think of dopamine as terrain, not a number

Picture your inner life as a landscape.
	•	Gentle hills: daily effort, small wins, routines
	•	Steeper climbs: creativity, love, purpose, long projects
	•	Peaks: sex, achievement, deep flow

Now imagine drugs not as hills — but as helicopters.

They don’t teach you how to climb.
They drop you on a summit you didn’t earn — and then leave you there.

The problem isn’t that the peak is high.
The problem is that everything else becomes a valley afterward.

⸻

About those dopamine “numbers” everyone remembers

These figures aren’t precise lab measurements. They’re directional metaphors — and they stick because they tell the truth people feel.

Natural, sustainable elevations
	•	Completing a task: ~100
	•	Long walk or movement with purpose: ~100–150
	•	Music that unfolds (an album, not shuffle): ~120
	•	Sex (connection + novelty): ~200–300
	•	Creative flow: ~250–300

These build maps. The brain learns how to return.

⸻

Socially normalized but flattening
	•	Sugar / junk food: ~150
	•	Alcohol: ~150–250
	•	Nicotine: ~200
	•	Gambling / slot-style apps: ~300+

These don’t destroy the terrain immediately — but they wear it down.

Alcohol deserves special mention here.
For some of us, it’s not a lubricant — it’s a wrecking ball.

I don’t moralize that. I lived it.

⸻

Drugs that hijack the system
	•	Cocaine: ~500–600
	•	Methamphetamine: ~1,200–1,500
	•	Opioids (including fentanyl): variable — but catastrophic in effect

This is the line people miss:

Meth doesn’t give pleasure.
It deletes comparison.

At that scale, the brain recalibrates. Normal life no longer registers as meaningful — not because it’s bad, but because the map has been burned.

That’s why addiction doesn’t look like joy.
It looks like agitation, restlessness, emptiness, rage, and despair.

Not depression.
Disorientation.

⸻

Cannabis, alcohol, and honesty

I live in Canada, where cannabis is legal, regulated, boring, and everywhere. The novelty is gone — and that matters.

I’ve had a decades-long relationship with cannabis, and it’s always been good to me. For me, it’s not a helicopter. It’s more like a friendly mosquito or spring leaves on a cold January tree — it softens the edge, it doesn’t erase the landscape.

Alcohol, on the other hand, was my kryptonite.
It amplified bad outcomes, blurred memory, and led to damage I had to own.

This difference matters, because blanket moralizing misses reality:

Different nervous systems respond to different substances in radically different ways.

And yes — some people seem to wake up happy, claim they’ve never been depressed, and naturally generate dopamine like it’s a solar panel.

Good for them. Truly.

But many of us carry multiple PTSDs, long depressions, nervous systems shaped by trauma, injury, or loss. When your tools are damaged, finding a livable life is work.

Judging people for how they manage broken instruments is lazy ethics.

⸻

Why creativity sits in the danger zone — and the rescue zone

Writers, musicians, filmmakers, thinkers — we’re vulnerable because:
	•	Creativity produces slow, cumulative dopamine
	•	Modern tech trains fast, shallow dopamine
	•	Drugs offer instant counterfeit meaning

But creativity has one saving grace drugs don’t:

It leaves the terrain intact.

You come back tired, not erased.
Oriented, not hollow.

That’s why people with creative wiring are at higher risk — and higher recovery potential.

⸻

How to elevate dopamine without destroying it

No monk nonsense. Just practical truths.
	1.	Effort before reward
Walk, then music. Write, then coffee. Cold, then warmth.
	2.	Completion beats stimulation
Finish small things. The brain logs closure, not excitement.
	3.	Novelty with continuity
New things connected to old meaning — not infinite feeds.
	4.	Music that unfolds
Albums > playlists. Unfolding > hits.

Boredom isn’t failure.
It’s the reset signal.

⸻

The real cost of chasing the peak

Addiction isn’t about loving pleasure too much.

It’s about destroying the internal map that makes ordinary life meaningful.

When the map is gone, people don’t know where to walk —
so they chase height instead.

That’s not weakness.
That’s a human nervous system doing the best it can with damaged instruments.",1,1765842242.0,WRXingaround,1,1.0,False

19M, I’ve been sweet on a girl (presumably mid-twenties like 25 and I know, too old for me) since August and shit’s really hit the fan. I used to work at the gas station she frequents. I always let her go with free coffee and when we talked it was sort of like friends even though we weren’t. Anyways, a couple days before my last day at the gas station, one of the mechanics from the auto body repair shop she works at comes down and buys a pack of cigarettes. I had a goofy name tag on that said Donald Duck and he goes “That’s not your name, is it?” I said no and then he says my real name followed by “last day friday?” I’m confused and go huh because I thought I misheard him, but he repeated it and I heard the same thing. The only way he could’ve known is if she told him, and the only way she would’ve known is by overhearing me mention it. Anyways, Friday rolls around and she congratulates me on it being my last day, and since it was my last day I figured I’d just take the leap and ask her out. Her response was maybe (basically a no) and I got her number and name. I give it a shot despite my doubts and nothing. 

Ever since then, we’ve been in the store at the same time as each other and never acknowledged one another. I thought she hated my guts, but she saw a post of me on facebook that doesn’t mention my name, it’s just an eating competition I won and a photo was taken. Post went sorta “viral” in my small town. I’m not really on facebook, I just have a stupid account and sometimes go on there. I’m going through the likes and there she is. This past Sunday, we’re both in the store. I’m having a convo with my uncle and making my coffee. She comes from the bathroom, walks past me in the other aisle and hangs out behind me from afar, and as soon as I walk away, she goes to make her coffee. 

I headed up to the mechanic shop to schedule an appointment today and she talked to me like nothing happened. I scheduled my appointment, but decided to break the ice. I said “It doesn’t need to be awkward” you said no and it’s okay” she responds “it’s not awkward” I go “you don’t have to wait for me to walk away to make your coffee.” She responded “I can’t look at other things? I was on my phone” I said “sorry if I upset you” and she said “I’m not upset” I said sorry and left. As I started my car to drive off I saw her walk towards the side of the shop. Maybe she had to do something, but I feel like I really upset her and he had to go cry or something.

Okay, to keep it simple, I study at uni & we are seperated in groups. A new girl joined my group that is very nice & cool. She hangs out with girls from another group, which I dont see very often due to different schedules. In this group, there is a girl that I really like, lets call her F & there are a few occassions that I hope she feels the same. We've met through this common girl we know, so she knows me & we also follow each other in socials. Here is a breakdown of the events in chronological order:

1) In a lesson, my group & F's group were together. F had a book with a disney princess on it, which I noticed. I commented in a funny but cool way about it, & she bantered with me about it back & forth. 

2) I was with 2 friends of mine in a hang out spot for a coffee. 2 tables to my left, F was sitting there with her friends. At some point, a person sitting next to me, tapped me in the shoulder & said: ""hey man, this girl wants to know where you' re from"". I look & the girl he talked about was F, giggling in a funny way, lets say. I didnt say anything, cause maybe she was joking, so I just laughed too & continued my conversation.

3) Before a morning lesson, we all sat in a corridor waiting for the prof. to arrive. I sat with my group & in front of me sat F with her friend from my group. When she sat she looked at me & together with her friend, F said ""Good morning, wont you say hello to us?"" In the same way when we bantered about her book. So I responded in a smart way & again we bantered for like 2 minutea, before she left for a separate room

4) In a lecture, while I was sitting down, I noticed F standing in a wall to my left around 6m distance from me. So I looked towards, her way & she saw me, smiled & waved her hand in a hello gesture. I did the same to her. After a while, I kept looking towards her. At some point, she was talking to her friend in her ear, & at that point I looked at her. Our gazes again found each other & she continued speaking to her friend, while keeping eye contact for a good amount of lets say 15s. 

Now, these are very minor events, maybe they dont mean anything. So, in your opinion, is there a posaibility she is interested to me? Should I maybe talk w/ her through the phone to keep touch or should I talk to her in person after the Christmas break (because we all leave now)?",1,1765841826.0,Crush,0,1.0,False

This morning I got up and experienced what historians will one day call The Great Feline Standoff of 2025.

See, Kelly didn’t just rescue a cat; she rescued it, confined it to her room, and then disappeared to hang out with friends like a teenager in a coming of age movie, leaving me alone with the consequences of her compassion.

So there I was. Coffee in hand. Barely awake. And behind a closed bedroom door?
A cat.
A trapped, confused, judgmental cat.

That room had turned into a hotbox of fur, litter, and bad decisions. Every time the door opened, it was like a crime scene aired itself out. I’m pretty sure the smell violated at least two building codes and a Geneva Convention.

And this cat… oh, this cat was mad. Mad at being confined. Mad at being rescued. Mad at me; the only adult left in the house who didn’t ask for any of this.

All night long it sang the song of its people: meow… MEOW… MEOOOOOW
Pawing at the door like it was filing an appeal with the Supreme Court.

Meanwhile, Kelly’s gone living her best life, sending texts like: “Is he okay?” “He just needs love.” “I’ll be back later.”

Later?!
Later doesn’t help the man inhaling litter dust and questioning his life choices at 6:30 in the morning.

So this morning, after surviving the noise, the smell, and the passive aggressive stare through the crack in the door, I finally said: Enough.

I opened the door.
I assessed the damage.
I made an executive decision.

That cat had overstayed its welcome in solitary confinement. This wasn’t a rescue anymore; it was a hostage situation.

Now the house is quiet. The air is breathable again. The floors no longer crunch when I walk. Peace has returned to the kingdom.

Kelly will tell this story like I’m the villain. The cat will tell it like it escaped tyranny. That’s fine. Every story needs a bad guy.

But this morning, while she was out making memories and I was home managing fur-based chaos…

I restored order.
And honestly?

I deserve a medal. 🏅",1,1765841666.0,u_SeaAcanthocephala123,0,1.0,False

My wife and I tried everything to get our finances on the same page. Spreadsheets that one of us would forget to update. Apps that cost more per month than our coffee budget. ""Free"" tools that we later discovered were selling our financial data to advertisers. The breaking point was realizing we were paying $15/month for a budgeting app while simultaneously trying to cut expenses.

So I did what any developer with too much free time would do: I built our own.

Initially the app was just for us, a simple envelope-style budgeting tool where we could assign every dollar a job and see where our money was going. But then friends and family members asked to try it and we realized that there's a gap in the market for budgeting software that's actually affordable.

**So here's what we came up with**

* Pay what you want pricing starting at $2.99/month
* Focus on households where you can invite your partner, spouse, or anyone in your household
* Privacy first design with data center based in Germany and Finland

**Features we have now**

* Envelope-style budgeting
* Savings goals with progress tracking
* Multiple accounts (checking, savings, cash, whatever you use)

**Features coming soon**

We're actively developing and have a roadmap that includes:

* Stock portfolio tracking
* Net worth tracking
* Recurring transactions

This project is a husband-and-wife operation and we're not chasing hockey-stick growth curves. We're not trying to ""disrupt"" anything. We're not going to get acquired and enshittify the product. We're building sustainable software that we use ourselves, every day.

Would love to hear similar stories, how you've grown a start-up focused on affordability rather than pure profit and whether you have advice for us. Thank you!

Some may say that i am being paranoid but I have been followed into the bathroom before and questioned why i would stay late, so i know it’s not my mind playing tricks on me. It has taken such a toll on my mental that i am sort of becoming paranoid or at least anxious of every movement I make. I no longer feel comfortable being near the register or even putting my hands in my pockets. Every single time after work the same employees will eye and stare at me when I walk out to clock out and even sometimes when I am clocking in. I would like to add that I do work at a coffee chain in a store and sometimes me and my other coworkers would make ourselves something to eat or take a few expired pastries home. On my end I am at fault because technically we aren’t supposed to, but no one has personally came to us and told us that we aren’t. I stopped taking food home because I thought that maybe I am being watched because of this but even after I stopped I and still being watched and followed around the store. I would also like to add that none of my coworkers at least when I am around has gotten the same treatment and I see the difference when they take home food and drinks. I’ve never stolen from the store either so I don’t know where this is coming from. I am already uncomfortable in my own body 90 percent of the time and It adds to it so much more that even when I think I look fine on the outside i also fear i don’t. I am not sure if I have a guilty expression on my face or if I just look suspicious. I don’t know anymore but it has been making me feel so anxious and uncomfortable and it makes me feel like a criminal. I have been followed by the security guard in the store before. Just yesterday I forgot to answer his question and he came back up to my area and watched me the entire time while making himself a drink. I even bring my own food from home and I am still immediately followed and watched.

I’ve sat outside before after shopping and a bunch of team leads have done a rap around while staring in my cart, or the security guard immediately comes outside and walks right past me while staring at me. The only excuse to their suspicion could be that recently I forgot to pay for an item, but even then I called the store and immediately let my manger know as soon as I realized what had happened. The next day I called to let the other manager know that I was returning to pay for the item with my receipt and I was still being watched. I worry so much now that this could happen again because I am also very forgetful and I am also unmedicated with adhd. I try to make it obvious that I am paying for something and even then I am still stared at and followed around the store. I just don’t know what to do anymore and I don’t have any other place to work that pays enough or a car to travel so I feel so helpless.

That rule comes from the small scar I still carry on my forehead.

Growing up as a child, I made it my daily challenge to raise my head above the dining table. At the time, the table felt extremely high, or maybe I was just too small for it. One day, I miscalculated badly and slammed my forehead straight into the sharp corner. That was the end of that challenge. I withdrew immediately. The scar is still there today. 

That incident is not the reason I went into the furniture business, even though most of my friends strongly believe it influenced my career choice. I do not think it pushed me into the business, but it definitely shaped the kind of furniture I choose to sell and use in my home.

When it was time to get a coffee table, I already had my toddler, and I was not ready to witness table injury version two. So I went for a round coffee table. Because of its circular shape, it is far less likely to cause serious injuries. With the wide range of designs available on Alibaba, I was able to get one for my bedroom and also add new collections for sale. I also noticed guardians were the ones that bought it most.

I'm a Chinese student prepping for CMU/UCB/Stanford grad school apps (targeting CMU), I'm so confused about the 2026 TOEFL changes.

My current situation: I took the TOEFL once and got 90. CMU wants 105+. I'd say I'm somewhere around B1-B2 level, I can communicate fine, but I'm not one of those people who knows how to score 110+.

So I found that ETS released a technical manual in October 2025 (document RR-25-12, 68 pages, very dry). I spent two days going through it, and here's what I found that's actually relevant for test-takers.

**The Big Changes (TL;DR version)**

**1. Scoring: 120 → 1-6 scale**

|Old TOEFL|New TOEFL (starting Jan 21, 2026)|
|:-|:-|
|0-30 per section|1-6 per section (0.5 increments)|
|0-120 total|1-6 total (average of 4 sections)|

The new scores map directly to CEFR levels:

* 6 = C2 (Proficient)
* 5-5.5 = C1 (Advanced) ← most grad programs
* 4-4.5 = B2 (Upper intermediate) ← most undergrad programs

**2. Adaptive Testing (MST) — Reading & Listening only**

Some Reddit posts made it sound like ""mess up the first question and you're doomed.""

Here's how it actually works:

* **Stage 1:** Everyone gets the same medium-difficulty questions
* **Stage 2:** Based on Stage 1 performance, you either get harder questions (Upper Module) or easier questions (Lower Module)

The final score is statistically calibrated based on question difficulty. So if you're in the easier module but answer most questions correctly, you can still get a high score. It's not a ""death sentence.""

That said, I'd still rather be in the harder module psychologically. Feels better knowing the system thinks you're doing well.

**3. New Question Types**

These are the ones I'm most worried about:

**Reading: ""Complete the Words""** 

You see a word with only the first half, and you type the rest.

Example:

>

Answer: *measurement*

The problem is, I don't have the ability to actually spell words correctly. (*accomodate* or *accommodate*? One m or two?) That's the most scary part for me in both Duolingo and Toefl.

**Listening: ""Listen and Choose a Response""** 

They play a short dialogue and you pick the most natural response. It's testing social awareness, not just comprehension.

Example:

>

Options:

* A. Sure, I'd love to. ✅
* B. I don't really like coffee.
* C. When did you start drinking coffee?
* D. Coffee is very popular.

B is grammatically correct but socially awkward. In English, you'd soften a rejection: ""I'd love to, but I have class.""

**Speaking: ""Listen and Repeat""** 

You hear a sentence and immediately repeat it. Sentences get longer.

Example:

>

Sounds easy until you try it and say: ""The professor... uh... postpone exam... because... unexpected things.""

RIP articles, tenses, and precise vocabulary.

**Writing: ""Write an Email""** 

Academic email writing. The challenge isn't vocabulary, it's tone and structure.

Bad example:

>

**4. AI Scoring (Writing & Speaking)**

I was skeptical but here's what the manual said: AI is basically as consistent as human graders. 

||AI-Human Agreement|Human-Human Agreement|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Writing|0.86|0.85|
|Speaking|0.89|0.96|

Plus, uncertain cases get sent to human reviewers, and there's regular auditing.

**My Personal Take**

Here's why I'm cautiously optimistic about this reform:

The new format seems to reward actual language ability more than test-taking strategies. The adaptive system, the practical question types (emails, natural conversations), the spelling requirements.

For people like me who have decent fundamentals but struggle with the old format, this might actually be better.

**What I'm Doing Now**

I've been using [WizPrep.ai](https://wizprep.ai) to practice. It's an AI-powered TOEFL prep platform that already has the new question types (Complete the Words, Listen and Repeat, etc.).

I genuinely use it and like it. It's pretty affordable and gives instant feedback on speaking/writing. Only downside is they currently have just 1 full practice test, but they say they supposedly 13 more are very soon. I already finished the first one, so... waiting for updates lol.

**Questions for this community:**

1. **Are any of you switching to Duolingo or IELTS because of the TOEFL changes?** I'm curious if this reform is pushing people away or if most are sticking with TOEFL.
2. **If you're prepping for the 2026 TOEFL, what's your strategy?** Are you focusing on new question types or just building general English skills?
3. **Anyone else stuck in the transition period?** I don't know whether to keep practicing old format or go all-in on new format prep. The timing is awkward.

Would love to hear your thoughts. And if you have questions about anything in the ETS manual, ask away. I basically memorized that thing at this point 😅

Fewer crowds, cooler temperatures and a more mysterious vibe. If you’re visiting Lisbon between November and February, a day trip to Sintra is still a great idea. These are five things I usually recommend:

	1.	Visit one palace instead of trying to see everything
In winter, it’s much nicer to take your time. Pena Palace is iconic, but Monserrate or Quinta da Regaleira can feel calmer and more immersive.

Link: https://www.parquesdesintra.pt/en/

	2.	Walk through the historic center and stop for pastries
The village feels more local in winter. Take a slow walk, grab a coffee and try travesseiros or queijadas in one of the traditional cafés.

Link: https://www.visitlisboa.com/en/places/sintra-historic-centre

	3.	Explore the gardens and forest paths
The Serra de Sintra is green and misty in winter, which makes short walks through the parks and gardens really special.

Link: https://www.alltrails.com/portugal/sintra

	4.	Enjoy the views without summer heat
Viewpoints around Sintra are much more pleasant in cooler weather, and the light is often soft and dramatic.

Link: https://www.visitportugal.com/en/node/73791

	5.	Do a winter photoshoot in Sintra
Winter light, mist and quieter locations make Sintra a beautiful place for photography. A short photo session is a nice way to capture the atmosphere of the trip beyond phone pictures.

If you’ve been to Sintra in winter, what did you enjoy the most?
And if you’re planning to go soon, which of these would you pick first?

Some people just have no empathy…,"Title: Some people just have no empathy… Service industry rant

So today I opened the restaurant completely by myself. I was everything: server, bartender, barista, hostess, food runner, and busser all rolled into one. Within the first part of service, I already had 9 tables, including two 7-tops. I was sprinting around greeting tables, making cocktails and coffee, running food, bussing, taking orders, and doing all the opening tasks.

Then a new table comes in. I greet them right away and say, “Hey, I’ll be right back to take your drink order. Just a heads up, I’m the only one here right now.” They nod like they understand. But immediately, the guy at the table has an attitude. He asks to be moved because it’s too loud. Fine. We move him. He asks again to move to another spot because it’s still too loud.

Meanwhile, I’ve got 7 different lattes balanced on a tray for other tables that are already waiting. Before I can even circle back to take his drink order, dude just stands up and walks out. As they’re leaving, I apologize again and remind them that I’m running the whole floor alone.

Fast forward to the end of my shift… 1⭐️ Google review. Claims they waited forever, that no one came to the table, and that the service was terrible. 🙃

Like… I literally acknowledged them and told them I was solo. I was clearly running around nonstop. But I guess some people just don’t care, and empathy is optional. Humans can be so unnecessarily miserable sometimes.

Anyway. Service industry things. Rant over.
Which is crazy because I literally acknowledged them, explained the situation, and was clearly running around nonstop. I guess being told upfront you’re solo doesn’t count.

Just want to get ahead of people asking why this woman is in my house right now.

Her nasty side, the old mom I grew up with, always shines through around my life milestones. This time it’s the birth of my perfect newborn. The absolute light of my life.

My mom is here for three weeks to help me while my husband is working. Today I saw her ugly side and I’m fucking exhausted. I’m done with her for the rest of the day.

well.

Baby is cluster feeding and I’m exclusively breast feeding so this is the third day in a row I’ve gotten 1-2 hours of sleep (total!) between feeds. My mom told me to wake her up after baby’s last morning feed so she could take her and I could nap.

Baby finishes eating at 9:30 and I hand her off

By 10 I’ve showered and shoved down some breakfast

By 10:45 I’m finally able to rest my anxious overtired brain and sleep

TELL ME WHY at 11:22 am my mother opens my door to ask me what tile my husband and I are choosing to remodel our bathroom

“wuh? Why? Tile? Wheres baby? Huh? Don’t wake me up”

\*whisper voice\* “oh youre sleeping? Sorryyyyy”

But the damage is done, reader. I’m awake. I tried fruitlessly to fall back asleep, but alas.

I got up and tidied a bit. Checked on my baby who’s having a photo shoot with grandma (naturally). I don’t mind. Posting photos of the grandkids online is a hard boundary she’s never crossed so she can have all the photo shoots she wants.

At 1 pm I feed my baby again. My mom is making a target run so I (so tired I’m actually trembling) asked her to get me a cold brew from Starbucks while she’s there.

I get a call from her around 2 pm that goes something like this:

Mom: where’s the Starbucks? 

Me: it’s at the front like at every target

Mom: hmm I don’t see it 

Me: it’s like by the cash registers 

Mom: …nope 

Me: what target are you at?

Mom: \*now with an attitude\* I don’t know. 

Me: well… how far away did you drive? 

Mom: I don’t knowww. 

Me: 5 minutes? 20 minutes?? 

Mom: I told you I don’t remember. 

Me: oh okay I get it you don’t want to get me coffee

see, I know my mom. She won’t TELL me that she doesn’t think I should have caffeine while breastfeeding but she has her ways of making sure I know. Like playing dumb. What godforsaken American can’t find a Starbucks in a target???

So now me and baby are sitting in the sun and listening to System of a Down (at an appropriate volume) so I don’t accidentally fall asleep.

I’m new here but not new to dealing with questionable behavior from the outlaws(Husband’s parents). To try and keep things short, I went no contact with them over a year ago due to JNMIL’s passive aggressive behavior towards me that included body shaming and racism, and my husband has been no contact for a few months now because when he tried to confront them about their behavior, his mother lashed out at us (mostly me) and doubled down on her right to say what she wants with impunity. Since then, she has tried to win my husband’s favor over by offering him coffee makers on Valentine’s Day, sending old school teachers of his to check on him while I’m at work, and send his dad over once to tell us that if she hurts me, it’s my job to keep it between my husband and I, and that “you shouldn’t tell parents that they did something wrong. That’s not what we did back in the day! It’s just how she is! You need to accept her how she is!” There’s more to this story, but not really what I’m here for today…

Since it’s more FIL related, I decided to come here with some hope of knowing how to go forward the right way and reduce my chances of getting into some trouble. Thank you for reading this far, by the way;

So, today we saw that a postcard envelope from a resort came in the mail with our address but FIL’s name on it and no return address on the envelope. At this point in time, we have been no contact and not taking any baits they’ve been throwing out for a while now. Husband wants to throw this out, but I’m afraid that FIL will eventually come to our home uninvited again to look for “his mail”. This isn’t the first time they have used mail to manipulate my husband into seeing them/speaking to them. In the past, they have held his mail at their house (we used to live there) and offered to hand it to my husband, only for when he arrived, his mother came out and used the opportunity to rewrite the initial blowup as our fault and convince my husband of her side of the story. 

My main issue is that throwing away someone’s mail is illegal in the US and I don’t want to get into some serious issues with the law, but we really don’t want this postcard at all. Moreover, we are annoyed that they’re using our address for things. For undeliverable mail that is addressed for FIL but using our address, what is the best way to deal with this? Do we keep it? Return to sender even though it has no return address? I do not want to reward their behavior with contact, but I fear that they might start escalating more if we don’t send them something, anything, that tells them to stop.

Distillery: Heaven Hill

ABV: 66.50%

Proof: 133.00

Age: 13 Years 7 Months

Mashbill: 78% Corn, 12% Rye, 10% Malted Barley

Nose: This is what all bourbons should smell like… Rich stewed cherries, old oak, browned sugar, some leather, a bit of spice, and a hint of plum. 

Palate: This is what bourbon dreams are made of. Maple syrup, barrel char, black cherry, intense brown sugar, tobacco, and the slightest hint of a coffee bean.

Finish: This is the finish of an LE bourbon, I don’t understand how this was batched… Barrel char for days, layers of rich old oak, some more black cherry, almost a cherry cola esque finish. Oh and if you didn’t already know, the finish is over a minute long for sure…

Final thoughts: This is what a Limited Edition whiskey performs like, I’ve put this in blinds and it performs for me to be better than 2023 George T Stagg. I know it’s been reviewed and I’m nearly two years or more late to the game depending on when this review comes out (written in July 2025). I’ve been able to snag 3 of these and this is my first one opened, this is special and I’ve shared it with friends and family. I’m holding onto two others that are the A23 laser code (who cares). Buy it if you see it for less than 150 per bottle, this is like the value king of the last 5 years.

So I decided to change my approach and focus on comprehension first. 

My goal is to get to a level where I'm able to consume Spanish movies and TV shows, so I can continue improving comprehension on autopilot while watching Netflix after work.

But to get to that level, I figured a slightly lower barrier approach is reading Spanish books, since I can take my time translating the sentences. I started doing that with regular Google Translate and then transferred the words to a flashcard app, but it felt a bit cumbersome, so I decided to build an app optimized for this use case.

The optimized flow optimized for:

* Get a Spanish book (I got Rebelion En La Granja / Animal Farm since I already read it in english so I roughly know what's going on)
* Open the app, go to voice input (press the + button on the top right, then manual input) 
* Read a Spanish sentence from the book out loud
* Read the translation to know what's going on in the book
* Save the sentence as flashcard
